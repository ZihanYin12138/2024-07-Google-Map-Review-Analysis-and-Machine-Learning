This entire office is very clean and conveniently located. Everyone there is very friendly and professional. Lori was exceptionally helpful, patient, and knowledgeable. She thoroughly explained all of the options for my treatment plan in great detail and answered all of my questions. She took care of everything so I could relax and focus on the outstanding care I received. With their evening and Saturday hours and amazing, caring, staff, I would never go anywhere else.</text>

<Text>So happy to have found Suave Dental in Riverbank! Super hardworking people there! Also, very honest about what work needed to be done and didn’t try to oversell. My husband had fillings, a crown repaired, x rays, and cleaning all in the same day! The dentist here knows what she’s doing and we feel like we’re in good hands!< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

They didn't make me feel judged, which is something I always fear when going to the dentist. I definitely recommend them for anyone that's scared of going to the dentist, they will do nothing but help you and make you feel better!</Text>< Pictures>

I am very happy with how the team works together to get patients taken care of. I, like most put off the dentist as much as possible. Since I've been going to Suave Dental in Riverbank, I'm super exciting about getting all the work done that needs to be done. My teeth aren't the worst but I am going to be 50 this year and I will be able to smile like I used too.  Thank you ladies & gentlemen for assisting me in a major transition in my life. 🤗<//text>

My first visit with this dentist was very pleasant.  The staff members were kind, gentle, and respectful of my gum sensitivity during cleaning.  I enjoyed the visit and look forward to going back to this office for my dental care.
Update:  I really like this dental office a lot.  My recent visit in particular everyone was kind and helpful.  The dental assistant is friendly and awesome at her job. I received excellent information and suggestions.  The dentist even took the time to check the new mouthwash and toothpaste ingredients I am using.  She is genuinely interested in what I have to say.  The level of dental care is exceptional.< /Text>

Unprofessional. A lot of miss communication between the dentist and the front desk. (well, that’s what Dr. Hernández made it seem). Never had a clear answer, I did not sign any paperwork they gave me or showed me because I didn’t trust them as soon as they were giving me wrong information about what the appointment I made was for.                                                              Update: Went to my 4/22/21 appointment that scheduled after I spoke from somebody from corporate in Sacramento (I forgot her name) she informed me Dr. Hernández no longer is working for them. I only went because she insisted. The front office ladies were nice and so was Dr. Kaur or Khan, but I don’t think I will be returning. Yes, the options for treatment were explained to me better during this appointment, but once trust is lost it really is hard to gain back.</Text>

Never visited this place personally! I know people who have been there and they have trouble getting their teeth fix in time and appropriately! And have read other reviews!

< review>
Did not have an appt. today.
Yesterday was a congenial experience, although my 11:30AM appointment was delayed, possibly by overbooking by a full hour. The employees Janet. Mary, Veronica and Sandra were very attentive and Dr.Kaur explained my Dental plan very clearly
so I would be able to make an empowered decision on my Dental History.

Regarding my January 29th appointment, It was extremely well handled. Two extractions and installation of an upper plate went very well and I was given instructions for maintenance, e.g. no weight lifting for a week, no straw usage, and only water or juice no carbonation.. I do, however, have some discomfort due to no IB Profen as directed since I have never used medication in my 75 Years on Earth.
I will refer friends and Clients to Dr. Kaur.< /review>

I had a great 1st visit at Suave. All the staff were very pleasant. Dr. Kaur was understanding and very easy to talk with about my fear of pain due to a previous experience at another dentist.  She was very gentle and explained in detail the dental work I would need to have done. She was able to calm my fears about coming back to get the work done at Suave.

Update: I've had several visits now to Suave Dental in Riverbank. I'm excited to share.. I'm no longer terrified of having dental work! 😁 (had previous dental work at another dentist yrs ago and they were unable to get me fully numb, it hurt so much, I was traumatized and hadn't been to dentist  for 5 yrs..which caused me to need alot more dental work.)
Dr. Momani and Dr. Kaur are amazing and very gentle in their dentistry. They were able to get my mouth fully numb and I didn't feel the dental work they performed. They really care about your dental health. They're both very professional, kind and take time to explain what they are doing, and check to make sure I'm comfortable. All of the staff at Suave Dental in Riverbank are very pleasant, respectful and kind. The office is always neat and clean too. I'm so glad I found this dental office and I will have all my appointments here from now on.<//text>

I went in to Suave Dental yesterday for a wisdom tooth extraction and it was one of my best experiences at any medical facility. My initial consultation a week prior went smoothly. I was well informed about what would take place and how to care for any infection. The day of the extraction went very smoothly. Dr. Momani was very thorough and I felt absolutely no pain. I was so impressed by how fast everything went. I had my procedure done yesterday and I already feel a thousand times better. I highly recommend this place!!!<//text>

worst experience with the front desk,first of all my wife brought my son along with my 3 month old daughter in for his dentist appt.we live 12 miles away and takes 30 minutes to get to the dental office,the girl at the front desk overlooked my sons name on the delta dental referral list that was online and sent my son home without being seen.
Right away I had  delta dental call suave dental to see what the issue was about,2 other employees at suave dental did confirm my sons name was actually on the list to be seen at their office,so my wife spent 1 1/2 hours getting the kids ready and driving round trip to the dental office just to be turned away by an employee that overlooked my sons name,I was so disappointed that I switched to another dental office!!!!< /review>

Office staff is always professional and a pleasure to work with.  As an HR professional I am impressed with the the customer service offered.

I would be in a lot of pain, if it wasn't for these amazing people.

Edit: Scam artist at its finest.  Won't fix teeth that 'they' messed up.  Won't actually listen to what you have to say, will just keep trying to get teeth filled or something else.  Never the problem that you came there with.</Text>

< Review>
Been having some trouble with my tooth now and when I finally decided to go get it check I called and they told me to come in that same day! Nice, clean and friendly! Staff were so nice and explained everything to me and were entertaining as well! Getting more work done hopefully soon for the hurting tooth and will update this as time allows! :)

Update: 4/22/2020

I am absolutely disappointed in this office! The office manager did not do her job and because of her and some of the workers I might have lost a tooth. I’ve been calling every other week for months since January waiting for a root canal approval to go theory get dental work done for a root canal.

Called dental-cal to see what is going on and it was approved back in December! This is extremely unprofessional of the office manager and her staff. I keep calling only to be cut off right away and say “The riverbank office is closed we can’t do anything.... I can leave a message” IVE LEFT AT LEAST 5 MESSAGES at least but seems to me that they just get throw into the trash can.

I am requesting a call back from the office manager from Riverbank and I am expecting them to get the dental work that I need done figured out. I should not have to suffer because someone can not do their job and I should not have to pay for any other experience that might be included because the loss of my tooth is not my fault, the office had more then enough time to contact me about everything but all I got were excuses.

I’ve been suffering for about 5-6 months now, not being able to eat on the right side of my mouth for 3, and now I’m even more restricted because the tooth chipped and broke off due to the tooth probably decaying!

Extremely unprofessional and very disappointed, no one answers the phone, manager does not know what she is doing and some people might be suffering because of horrible office management. I still expect to get my work done here but after that I will be filing a complaint with the BBB and will escalate this as high as I can. Only office that I know of doing a great job is the Modesto office!

Update: 5/20/2020

I was finally able to get my dental work completed and I can finally breath a little!

I’m glad that the tooth was able to be saved and I did not have to get it pulled so I’m great full for that. I’m also very great full for the doctor and assistant as well! I actually experienced very little pain at all and only felt it here and there but that’s about it.

They were also able to put a temporary crown on as well and I’m great full for that because that means I can actually start eatting more solid foods!

I’m glad that the two of them were able to pull through for about 4 hours and I’m glad that they did. Biggest shoutout to the dental assistant she’s the sweetest, every time I go in I enjoy our conversation and also nice to hear from her family and congratulations on the new born as well! You are the best girl!

Unfortunately I can’t rate this office a 5 only because even before the pandemic started it shouldn’t take 3-4 months to let a patient know that an authorization has been approved, so I do have to poor note that.

Thank you for the dental work and I hope to receive the same service I did today when I go in for my permanent crown!</Review>

I was pleased with my last visit, the dentist who did my deep cleaning did a great job. He is very friendly, caring and speaks Spanish. The dental assistant was very caring and attentive couldn't ask for a better service.< /review>

More recently in early 2019, Dr. Momani took the time to educate me and explain his analysis and recommendation. Very professional.

Now, in addition to routine visits, I have had my second major procedure, very necessary.
From education, recommendation, through to successful, painless completion, I am very happy with the outcome. An important factor is that everyone on the staff is part of the TEAM.
Each person, irrespective of role, is concerned about our concerns and ensuring a great experience.

This is the second time to visit Dr. Ahmed's office.
Dr. Ahmed Momani is excellent, gentle and very kind. I always afraid of any dentist but with   Dr. Ahmed I surprised to have easy root  canal !!!!!!!!! and very fast. Also his office staff is professional, speaking friendly and easy to work with. They take many insurances and always schedule quickly appointment for emergency appointments.
I love Suave Dental and I would like to say thank you Dr. Ahmed and all office staff, I appreciate you and your help.
================================
( 1 )
This is the first time to visit Dr. Ahmed's office.
Dr. Momani is the best dentist professional
and he has great and kind heart. He and all his staff are very respectable and kind people. I'm about 65 years old and I visited many dentists I was very nervous every time, but when I visited doctor Momani's office I felt relax and I said that this is the first time I feel that I'm with my family and I am very happy with them< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>He is a rude disrespectful person who treated me with no respect. He was suppose to call in perscription for antibiotics and pain but didnt called in and waited over an hour and was left in pain rest of night. I will report to dental association ..very discriminating.
After the above incident contacted office spoke to Paul who was wonderful. He advised that he would speak to the dentist who helped her and have someone else take care of my daughter. He also assured me that he would take care of everything. He took care of perscription problem.  But most impressive was that later this afternoon Paul called to see how daughter was doing.
So i thank you for your kind service.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>I have to admit that Suave Dental office in Riverbank is the Best in the  County ! Not only do they have an AMAZING Staff who genuinely cares about each and every Patient , the dental Assistants  have tons of  patience especially if you’re nervous  ! The sensitivity the staff &  Dr Morimani DDS  Excellent  Customer Service He Genuinely gives 100% of himself  , he’s Kind ,  funny , Great Smile , soft spoken & with years of Experienced , foremost provides a Clean environment who  follows STATE Guidelines... Dr Morimani and staff doesn’t cut Connors . I Love that his front office staff who does all the billing and they tell you upfront your share and what your insurance will cover . Have I mentioned that they don’t over charge!!! In fact they’re reasonable $$,  , not like other offices that  Gouge you & Not  upfront.  I’ve worked in the dental profession for 10yrs before I changed professions to Hospital  although I enjoyed my work  I can honestly say it’s difficult to find a Good Dentist 🦷 who’s TRUST WORTHY & pain free. Did I Mention $  reasonable . Dr Morimani Thank You for your  superb Service and excellent Care . I’m Proud to Tell people about Suave Dental in Riverbank. Everyone is Greated with a Smile & Happy to be at Work ... the environment is always stress free . Being Greeted with a Warm Inviting Smile. Thank You Suave for making Me Your Loyal  patient & feeling Special.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>Dr Momani is great. The staff is fantastic. I’ve had extensive dental work done from simple cleanings to crowns to an extraction, and a permanent bridge. Dr Momani referred me to a specialist for my root canals because he recognized that that was what I needed. Everyone I’ve worked with is very personable.

While the previous is still true, I recently had a very different experience. I would like to explain to Dr Momani what happened and why I couldn’t speak with him after my last appointment< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>My mother is s patient of Suave dental at the Riverbank location, and every time she's had a visit, its been nothing but friendly,  courteous and professional approach, from the front desk clerks to the doctors themselves.  Both Dr. Momani, whom treated her the first time, and Dr. Hasib (hope I spelled her name correctly) who treated her today, have her feeling taking care of in the best way.

<text>I had not had work done on my teeth in a long time and was a little nervous. Dr. Momani acknowledged that and was very nice. He was very gentle with the numbing injection and I hardly felt anything. Knowing I may be in some pain because of the amount of work i had done, he called to check on me the next day. I will reccommend him to everyone<//text><rating>5</rating>< pics>

<Text>My daughter called in to see if Suave accepted Medi-Cal she has a hard time asking about that for her grandson who really needs to have it due to a mental condition. The receptionist was so helpful and did not make her feel like she was trying to get service for nothingby asking about this. Most companies who take Medi-cal are very rude. So I don't know about the dentist yet but my daughter feels wonderful about the experience so far.< /Text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) I have been with them for 2 years and from the beginning they did a bad job for me, but I thought. Well, anyone is wrong, they look honest and are very friendly. On one occasion I got a new dentist and I had a very bad experience because he was very rude and criticized me because I had a panic attack from the injections. I did not make a fuss, only the tears rolled and my breath shook and the man told me that I was traumatized. Total that I told the reception what happened to me and she raised a report and they apologized to me. Then I started to struggle with a root canal and a crown that they put on me and it all started because they didn't want to take responsibility for the work they did to me. I have more than a year that it hurts and they only give me antibiotics and for the pain and after months the same problem returns. For that job I paid 2,500 dollars. And it does not seem fair to me that now they tell me that it has no guarantee and less because too much time has passed. Being that I have told them from the beginning and they only tell me that they are waiting for the owner's approval to fix the problem. Because 2 dentists have told me that the crown is not well assembled and that I take care to fit it and that it seems that they left me a nerve and that is why it hurts. Apart from that more than one job they have repeated to me because they did not do it well. Well, today I called and the receptionist treated me badly and told me that they couldn't do anything for me that I had to pay again. I am going to go to another dentist but I will see who can help me with this problem.

Tengo 2 años llendo con ellos y desde un principio me hicieron mal trabajo, pero pensé. Bueno cualquiera se equivoca, se miran honestos y son muy amables. En una ocasión me toco un dentista nuevo y tuve una muy mala experiencia por q fue muy rudo y me criticó por q me dio un ataque d pánico por las inyecciones. No hice escándalo solo se me rodaron las lagrimas y se agito mi respiración y el señor me dijo q estaba traumada. Total q le conté a la de recepción lo q me paso y ella levanto un reporte y se disculparon conmigo. Después empecé a batallar con una endodonsia y una corona q me pusieron y ay empezó todo por q no se an querido hacer responsables del trabajo q me hicieron. Tengo más d un año q me duele y solo me dan antibiótico y para el dolor y a los meses vuelve el mismo problema. Por ese trabajo yo pague 2500 dls. Y no se me hace justo q ahora me digan q no tiene garantía y menos por q ya paso demasiado tiempo. Siendo q yo desde un principio les e dicho y solo me dicen q están esperando la aprobación del dueño para arreglar el problema. Por q 2 dentistas d ay mismo me an dicho q la corona no está bien ensamblada y q ocupo q me la acomoden y q parece q me dejaron un nervio ay y q por eso me duele. Aparte q mas d un trabajo me an repetido por q no lo hicieron bien. Bueno como hoy llame y la recepciónista me trato mal y me dijo q no podían hacer nada por mi q tenía q pagar d nuevo. Yo voy a ir a otro dentista pero veré quien me puede alludar con este problema..< /text>

<review>Being the day before Thanksgiving, to have a clogged kitchen sink is pretty rough. I scheduled an appointment easily online. They arrived on-time and in PPE. Albert worked diligently until he had cleared the kitchen drain, literally saving our Thanksgiving! During these times having someone that was willing and able to still provide a service and get it done while following laws amidst the pandemic is amazing. Thank you so much for the hard work Albert!<//review>< pictures>

Josh was on time in the window of timeframe.
He was super professional and wanted to make sure our drains were unclogged and he was very knowledgeable, he really went the extra mile, as we have had other companies out we always return to ROTO ROOTER.
Don’t get confused with Rescue rooter, they are super shady from my experience.
He was also a nice guy, dressed well not sloppy he cared about his appearance, super professional.
Would love to have him out again :-)< /text>

Called on Friday afternoon with my main line blocked. They sent a great guy, Bi, who took care of the job in a very professional manner, and was very friendly and easygoing. Im going into the weekend with everything functioning perfectly again. I need the same job done every year or two due to roots, and most of the people who’ve done it in the past have acted like it was a terribly hard and burdensome task, but Bi accomplished it with a smile and a confidence ease. I’m not sure if you can request a particular person respond to your call, but if they let you, ask for Bi. I don’t think you’ll be disappointed.< /review>

$300 for a 1 hour service is out of line.  Technician was profession and the time to get service was very quick.

7/29/20
I am upgrading my rating to 4 stars.  The Branch Manager contacted me and arranged for a video of our sewer line and it showed some pretty bad stuff inside and also some damaged portions.  I agreed to have them replace most of the galvanized pipe and they gave me a credit for the previous work done.

A quality control person also stopped by a couple of times to check the work and do a final video inspection.

I still think that the price for the initial service was high, but they are a 24hr service and they have some good plumbers.  Just be aware that an initial call will probably not be less than $300.<//review>

Francisco tech #7433 is professional and friendly.  He unclogged my sink quickly.  I had another well know pluming company that was unable to finish the job.  Francisco from Roto-Rooter not only handled the job quickly, but again he is extremely professional.<//Text>

<review>Victor is knowledgeable, polite and does a thorough job. Came out the same hour I called. Explained everything and how the issue was happening and multiple solutions for our pipe problem. He even helped clean out the water from that spilled over from the area and disinfected it before he left. Thank you! If I ever have more plumbing needs definitely calling them first.<//review>< pictures>

I was very happy with the service I received today. Roto-Rooter dispatched two different teams to me in less than two hours after I called. Both Fred and Ronnie are very knowledgable, professional, and courteous. They really cared and tried to find the best solution to solve my pluming problem. They presented the available options, pros and cons of each, and their recommendations. Thank you Fred, Ronnie, and Roto-Rooter.<//Text>

< Review>
Update: Had some agravations...leaks, but the management sent one of their best guys Michael and fixed it! Thank you very much.
Hopefully will be ok! Glad they do insure their work.
Had to install a very new (rel in Jan 2020) reverse osmosis water filtration system. Was a very complicated task since Josh and Francisco had to remove the old one and re-du the little plumbing for the new complicated system. We had some back and forth but due to the complexity of what they did...I totally command and appreciate their professionalism and responsibility.
Good job. Thank you!</Review>

Strong free WiFi throughout the camp. We had spot 21 which is all grass (like most of the sites) and large enough for a big tent and 2 cars. There's also very hot showers behind a code locked door and a laundry room. The camp host is very nice and also runs the camp gas station/grocery store. Not a place to let kids just run around, as its clearly stated that all animals and children must be closely watched and handled. There is a camp cat though that wanders through.<//text>

We stayed only for one night cause we got here late, but it was beautiful. They were friendly, had clean bathrooms, water, electricity and we had plenty of space and privacy.<//text>

<review>This is likely the best campground I have EVER stayed in. Nice and quiet but reasonable distance to town, the store is an actual store and the owners sure know what they're doing. Not to mention they're friendly and helpful. Convenience of a hot shower and running water AND laundry with the maintained grounds made tent camping so much more comfortable. I would pass on a hotel to be here.<//review></record>

<text>Linda the host is awesome and so friendly and sweet. I dropped in with the local state park campground being full and had a great site a 7 minute walk to the beautiful beach. There’s also an awesome cat that lives at the campground who will cuddle you hard and that is a big bonus<//text><rating>5< /rating><pics>None</pics></record>

Owner pays attention to what is going on in his park. Showers are very old but clean and adequate.  The peacefulness and quiet (except for some daylight highway noise) is very relaxing.  I will stay there every chance I have.< /text>

The store is awesome for supplies near the campsite along with nice showers (that seems to work without coins, unsure if they’re going to fix that), free WiFi, and a perfect tent site in case you don’t want to be somewhere so public like a state park but want the decent amenities for camping. Would come back with friends! Maybe even make it a tradition!<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>Located just 3 miles north of Fort Bragg California. Very nice rv spaces with electricity and water and tent only spaces too. The park is small and quiet. Large bushes and trees provide good privacy. Showers and laundry available for a fee. Well stocked country store with gas located on site. Would be five stars if the restroom and shower facilities were cleaned more often and maintained better.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

We stayed at this campground for the first time this last weekend and will definitely stay again.

The campground is set up so each campsite offers privacy and we felt like we were in our own little oasis in the woods.</text>

We have tried since January to call this place and never any answer or answering machine.  Once they finally did answer they didn't even bother to look to see if there was an opening before just saying no they were full all summer.  Big disappointment.< /review>

<Review>This is a great shop, good vibe and friendly barbers. I came in to get my mohawk cleaned up and My barber Kevin took his time and got a really close shave and finished it off with a straight razor. He also lined up my beard. Everything looked great and I saw the other barbers giving nice cuts as well. I'll definitely be back and I recommend you give them a try.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMh2eeEr3cyPbVdXZ90zprt1eNnSy_Obf-lGtSk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTWQz_vtmOYYn2IympQZ1aGTs9jkTUl5Bgcxfu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYYYiM5HkXfkvUc2uZBvoD_B-2jENFkNia5vZj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcTLwTsR8PWgLBzNmgau6E0RH7X9oln77Keqoq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPy0TTezlShkywNd8k_bWzDHUa7sryxh__XzhfL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfxJoHuZZ9WgYQUOMakrJWlwGZ-BHzNz14zzPd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

They only accept cash but the barbers are professional. I would recommend setting appointments if you dont like to wait. Johnny is a great barber and pays close attention to what you want.< /review>

Really clean shop and great quality tools and chairs.

It is obvious that these guys care about their business and their clientele with the way they keep their shop updated. Fresh paint and good music make a haircut here enjoyable.  Make an appointment if you would like to actually get your hair cut. These guys are super busy and would love to fit you in. But don’t be a pain and walk-in.  Be the Man and set an appointment.< /text>

<Text>Place looks clean and not shavy like a couple I went to before I found them on Google maps, courteous hello when you walk in. Very cool barbers, nothing else to say but good things, I do recommend this place for dads and sons, keep up the great hair cuts and beard shaves!</Text>< user_name>

The cuts do take a long time but its well worth it because they are very detailed with their work. Its never hard to get in and be seen. Haven't found a shop that does great work like they do here, they have great talent.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<Text>It's hard to find a good quality barber these days. The big chains like Supercuts always seem to mess up even the simplest of haircuts, because they don't really care about what they're doing. Tonight was my first time at Ambitiouz, and I was impressed with my barber, Andy, and his attention to detail. He asked several questions about small details that most would simply gloss over and cut my hair in their own preconceived way. Andy made sure we were on the same page and cut my hair just the way I like it. I'll definitely be going back in a few weeks for my next haircut.</Text>< resp>

Pros: Great customer service. Barbers take their time to give you a nice, clean haircut.

Cons: Long wait times. They charge an extra $5.00 to make an appointment.< /text>

<text>Great atmosphere, I didn’t catch my barbers name, but the dude with the plugs gave me one of if not the best cut I’ve had in a long while. They really make you feel welcomed when you come in probably the best barber shop in OC, you might have to wait a while but it’s worth it.</text>< pics>

Asked for a men's undercut got a men's undercut. They let me charge my phone that died while I got my haircut. Guy that cut my hair took his time and made sure to match the picture I showed him as close as he could manage. All in all was a pleasant experience. This was a one off visit while traveling but I'd go there again.<//text>

<Text>There is a few barbers who cut very well. I only know one Barber name and his name is Andy. You can follow him on Instagram @francocutz, I would recommend calling the shop ahead of time because they normally go by appointment only. Just in case they might accept walk-ins and your time is not wasted. Overall, good vibes at the shop.</Text>< Name>

I went through 5 "less than desirable" haircuts looking for a competent stylist. Gina nailed my cut the first time and has done so the last 30 cuts...she is good! She is also a wizard with hair color and I have since introduced my entire family to Gina who cuts all of our hair. Women, men and children...we all look good.

Gina Pham is wonderful!  I have been coming to her salon for several years for hair coloring and cuts.  She is always kind, enthusiastic and gives thoughtful advice on hair care. Her salon is always so clean and comfortable.  She is considerate to her clients and her work is always good and reliable.  I brought my teen son in recently for a haircut and he was so pleased with his whole experience, too!  Thank you, Gina!< /review>

She finally has her own studio; she outgrew the studio she was previously in and her new studio is conveniently just down the hallway! She is so meticulous and really listens to her customers and what they want. She cuts off exactly what I ask for. I've been a loyal customer for 2 years and will keep coming back. She colored my hair bayalage style 2 years ago. Love that my natural dark brown hair blends beautifully with the color she added and that it doesn't create that "line" and no orange.

This is my second visit.  And i am totally coming back to see her again. She colored my hair, gives a fabulous head message while adding product that made my dry  frizzy hair silky and shiny and also cut my hair just the way i asked. I Highly recommend Gina Salon Studio 30.  She is affordable and super nice.</Text>

This was my first ever hair color experience and Gina made sure I was comfortable. She helped me pick the color for my highlights. She trimmed my hair without affecting the length too much and it looks sooo healthy and shiny!!!! No dryness at all.< /Text>

Gina gave me the BEST haircut experience of my life!! When I first came across her studio on google, I couldn’t believe the amount of 5 star reviews she had. She definitely didn’t disappoint.

I naturally have light brown hair and I came in to dye my hair dark brown. While she easily could have done what I asked and taken my $150+, she was completely honest with me from the beginning. She said that the maintenance would be incredibly expensive and my hair wouldn’t look good after my roots started to grow in.

Although I was a bit frustrated at first because I had my heart set on dark brown hair, she advised that I get a fresh cut and deep conditioning treatment instead. That way my natural color and hair texture would be enhanced without the need for expensive color.

She ended up giving me a the treatment and cut beautiful layers into my hair! All the while, we talked about pop culture, family, and she gave me great tips on hair care. She was so kind and easy to talk to. I am so grateful that she was upfront and honest about dyeing my hair. She saved me so much money and I needed up just getting some temporary dye from the drugstore. My hair has never looked better!! I will definitely go back when I need a fresh cut! Thank you Gina!!!<//Review>

< Review>
I moved to California about two years ago and was so afraid to let anyone touch my hair so I let it go. Then I got tired of looking at my hair and decided to look up a highly rated salon in the Irvine area. I came across Gina's place and decided to give her a try. Boy! Am I glad that I decided to take this step. Gina is a sweetheart. She's very easy going and has her own salon where all the attention is on you without any distractions. I have really dry, brittle hair and told Gina what I had done with it in the past.  She listened and gave me great advice to combat the dryness and color option. When she was done, I was absolutely amazed by her talent. My hair looks beautiful and feels so much healthier than before. She also gave me the best haircut that I can style different ways. If you are looking for a great haircut or a great hair color place, go see Gina!! She will hook you up!!</Review>

<review>Gina is wonderful. She's very accessible, has a site to book appointments, and is very communicative. She texted to let me know I could come in early for my appointment if I wanted. She asked me how I wanted my hair, and listened when I told her what I wanted. I have very long hair (I get it cut when I keep sitting on it), and she did an initial cut when it was wet, then another cut while dry do that she only took off as much as I wanted. The layers in the front were even, gradual and not chunky. All scissor cut, no razors. My hair is healthy and I love the style. Reasonable pricing, friendly, and good service.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I can trust that she won't cut more than we discuss, I've had the opposite happen elsewhere. Not with Gina. She's very careful by doing the trim in 2 stages, confirming with me so that too short never happens! I like her ideas about color, too. I found her quite fun to talk with.

I've always been super nervous when it came to cutting my hair short, but Gina did an AMAZING job! It was my first time getting perfect hair cut. The same time my Mom who's so happy with her hair color. My Mom and I definitely left feeling comfortable and more confident in ourselves! Gina is so great at her job and at making you feel like you have total control over how your hair turn out. Thank Gina:)< /text>< pictures>

I found Gina a year ago and I must say she is the ONE to go. Went last week on my birthday to spoil myself and she did again a great job with Balayage and cut. She got new colors in that day and I was the first one to get it on my head. Great fashion colors, we have chosen pink, purple, midnight blue and teal.  I just love it, the colors last very long, I still had blue in my hair from 4 months ago. I highly recommend her, if you want to look different then anyone else. Gina is fun and takes the time she needs to look your best. If you like good and a great variety of colors, or just a great hair cut, go to her, you will not be disappointed.</text>

<text>Gina, thank you so much !!  I’m not one to write reviews but this is very special !!  I will continue looking until finding the best stylist and this is the first I’ve been this happy since our move here to Southern California . And to have my adult sons speak so highly also speaks volumes.  Our cuts, the styling, my coloring and the Japanese conditionin have always been amazing !!  I enjoy sitting in your chair and always look forward to coming back.<//text><GmapID>0x80dcdc450ec39e53:0xbd2dab752b70906e</GmapID><resp>None<//resp><rating>5</rating>< pics>

Gina is a real professional.. she is quick and got my highlights just the way I wanted without damaging my hair. My hair was treated and very dark. She managed to give me highlights without turning red. Love my hair.  She is amazing. My visit was very smooth and entertaining.</review>

<Review>Great service from Gina! As a guy, I've had many bad experiences with hair salons, as many assume I want it all cut off. Not the case with Gina. She listens carefully to what I want doing and takes the minimum amount off and goes from there. Very precise and attentive, giving good styling tips and advice along the way.<//Review>< Pics>

Gina is Amazing! I'm so glad she has her own studio now. She knows exactly what to do from showing her just one picture of what you want. She always cuts the tiniest amount off first and then works from there! I love how detailed and precise she is with her trimming. I usually worry about getting haircuts, but she makes me feel so comfortable and safe ^_^

Very nice and funny too :)<//review>

Gina is an awesome hair stylist.     She is honest and professional (very hard to find nowadays).    I had a cut .. color.. and highlights.    Gina truly took the time it required to process my hair correctly..   I am so thankful and grateful to Gina ...   she also recommended a conditioner for my dry hair and my hair hasn't been this healthy in years.    Thank you Gina for being you!!!</Review>

Expert hair care. Gina is very professional and quite skilled with all hair types. She has been coloring and styling my wife's hair and cutting son's hair for several years now and never once has it been a less than expected. Gina always goes the extra mile.<//Text>

First of all I don't write much reviews. But this place has blown my mind. She took the time to listen and break down my options and finish with the best performance ever with the most surprising finish. I was mind blown. Left the place and within the matter of days I had a bunch of compliments for my new hair cut. I recommend this place to anyone as she treats you like family and gives you the best options out there and when she does it you will not regret it. Much appreciated for the new hair style and quality work.</text>

<review>Amazing!i had been wanting to try ombré for longest time. I finally worked up the never after being scared from disastrous experience from year back.
Gina was nothing short of a miracle worker! She was friendly, and easy to talk to. The result are magnificent , and I couldn't be happier! I'm absolutely in love with my hair and can't wait to go back for the future touch ups, cut, and blowout. Thanks Gina for a truly fabulous experience!<//review>< name>

Gina did my hair today and I couldn't be happier! I came in with ruddy, brassy 3 week old high/low lights and wanted to lighten my hair up to a blonde balayage. She was very careful not to damage my hair any further and gave my hair lots of dimension and warmth. I love it! She did the base and hair painting in just a little over 2 hours with hair cut ! I am very happy with it and will definitely be going back to her.< /review>

I loved getting my experience at Gina's; she's so welcoming and genuine, treated & styled my hair wonderfully, and gave me great tips on how to care for my hair afterwards. It was little hard to find her studio at first (it's inside the Sola Salon building), but I'm glad I came!< /Review>

<user>111564036989907732881</user><Text>DO NOT GO HERE. My buddy has worked in car sales for 20 years and said these guys are the most shady salesmen he's ever talked to. There's 2 parts to this review. One from 2018 and one from May 2021.
I purchased a brand new lancer from them in 2018 I bought a 2015 model that was sitting on the lot for 3 years. Immediately after buying the car broke down leaving me stranded on the freeway. They did replace the parts for free since it was brand new but that worried me a lot.. I decided to go back this weekend to turn in my lancer and buy a used car. First of all, they will jack up the APR rate so they make more commission. They first quoted me at 11% and said that's the best they can do. After negotiating for 2 days they finally got me to a 6.9% but said they needed proof of income. When I asked to see the approval statement with the stipulation of proof of income they, all of a sudden, were able to get proof of income waived. I then asked for an inspection report which they would not show for me. I also asked to see the car fax and they wouldn't give me that either I had to spend $40 for a car fax report. From there things got worse. They proceeded to insult me and make me feel crazy for wanting more information on the car. They even insulted me for not having hub caps on my car where 3 salesmen were laughing at me calling me cheap. They were raising their voice at me and I was there with my 9 year old son. I had to ask my son and wife to step out at that point. Then I asked what the name of the salesman was and he would not give it to me and told me I wasted his day. See attached picture.

<Text>Talked to Patrick over there for a few minutes about trading my Challenger in on one of the Evolutions that they have. He told me that they did not have any under $30k, despite there being 5 or more on their website and on CarGurus for sale in the low to mid $20s. This dealer lists cars that they do not have, or leaves up old ads for cars that have long since sold so that they come up at the top of the search results.

On top of that, he had me send him a detailed email that took quite some time to put together, so that they could evaluate my trade. Never got a meaningful reply. I sent another email a couple of days later to see if he received it and he simply replied, "Got it..."  Seriously? Not even the decency to tell me they weren't interested in my car?

Bad customer service, shady sales tactics, poor professionalism. Take your business elsewhere!</Text>< Pics>

I bought a used car here and it was the easiest and most pleasant experience to date. We negotiated a price over the phone and I got exactly what was agreed on. I was nervous that it wouldn't end of happening. I was so happy during the experience that I bought the LowJack from them as well.</Review>

Very nice people that work there and seem to be honest and upfront and not try and take you for everything you got. They seem to work with you. I can't give 5 stars yet because we all know dealership at the end of the day are out for themselves so give me a few months and I'll give another review< /Review>

I bought the car from this dealer, it was what you would expect from a car dealership, then  a couple days later and not even 100 miles since I had gotten the car it left me stranded on the side of the road. $1500 later it's back up and running and problems are arising every now and then.

I don't know where to start. Trying to buy a car from them, out of state. We did all the heavy lifting, secured a loan even had someone local test drive it for us. The dealership has extremely bad customer service. Very rude and unresponsive. When it came time to get the deal done, James sent us forms specifically stating that the car was damaged prior to them getting it (carfax states no damage) and that the odometer is inaccurate  and more statements of this nature. When I asked about the form, he said we need to sign the form or the deal is off. He would not tell me why these statements are even on the form. Just said it's their policy. Next, the interest rate showed 9+%.. We were approved from our bank for 1.9% .. Got some really strange reason for the paperwork showing 9%. Said once we pay them , we can work with our bank.. Honestly couldn't make sense of it. And it's a contract that we are required to sign.... James was very rude about the whole thing.
We, of course backed out. VERY SLEAZY DEALERSHIP< /Text>

<text>I really LOVED the experience there.  Everyone was super nice! Everything was so clean. The only reason why i didnt give it a 5 star rating is because they had gave me a price over the phone for my oil change. Which was 59 plus tax. So about 65 dollars. And when i paid it turned out to 89 dollars. WITH a 10 dollar discount coupon. I live in Anaheim and id go to the Mitsubishi dealership here to get an oil change, but since they closed i went to Costa Mesa. Other than that everyone was friendly.< /text>< Pictures>

I had a pleasant experience buying my dream car from South coast Mitsubishi. Since this was my biggest investment ever I had to be extra careful and had a lot of questions about the car. The team at south coast Mitsubishi were super nice and answered all my questions patiently. I would definitely do business with them again.</Text>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>Months after selling an old car to the dealership and financing a brand new one, I came back in to LEND official state paperwork to the dealership to help them perfect the sale of the old vehicle. They have misplaced the paperwork, lied about it, lied about updating me as to its location, etc. They have made it abundantly clear that none of them have any idea how to process the purchase of a car as part of a sale, and the entire dealership should be closed down while it retrains. The service department, however, is wonderful. They all know what they are doing, and the only complaint I could possibly give is that service does not come with an interior cleaning.</Review>< pictures>

Was in the market for a specific model but had a limited budget. Patrick, the sales rep helped me every step of the way and constantly texted and called me when something that fit my situation came available, great customer service!<//review>

<Text>I just bought my first brand new car, and let me tell you I was absolutely blown away by the people here. Not only did they help me find exactly what I was looking for but they did the absolute best to stay within my budget and price range and I am seriously so happy with my purchase. The people here are so friendly and the customer service is by far the best I have ever come across. I'm so excited to be apart of the Mitsubishi family, thank you for making this the best experience I could have ever imagined!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1595467216459, 'text': 'We are so happy that you had an amazing experience with purchasing your new car!!!!

If I could give this place zero stars I would!! We bought a used vehicle from them on Feb 8th and 12 days later the truck broke down. I called the dealership to ask for assistance and they simply stated they couldn't do anything for us besides provide me with a 1-800 number to call. Then when I called the number I had to jump through hoops to get help. I wouldn't recommend this dealership to anyone!< /review>

<review>So much to say, so little space lol. Took my husband to see his dream car for his bday this past week. Leo was a great salesman from day one. I had spoken to him over the phone a few times because we live in Bloomington. When my husband and I arrived, he made sure we were taken care of. He was patient with my husband and he let us test drive some cars. At the end, my husband was just not convinced so he introduced us to the only Evo Final Edition they had on the back that day, and my husband fell completely in love. With that being said, we want to thank Leo and his team for making my husband’s dream happen. If it wasn’t for Leo calling me back a week prior, we wouldn’t had gone to see cars. Juan and Sep were excellent to us as well when we did the paperwork. Thank you South Coast Mitsubishi team!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

This review is well overdue.
I suggested my husband get a new car since his BMW was no longer under warranty. I love my 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport and he seemed to also like driving it also. We went to the dealership where we were welcomed by the sales team and the owner. The owner recognized me right away as a returning customer. We ended out getting a fantastic deal on the new 2020 outlander sport GT. We were no crazy about the burnt orange color when we’re were buying it, but now are in love with it. The owner personally was able to give us a deal on the car we couldn’t refuse. He also gave a great trade in value for his BMW. He was very accommodating to our requests and stayed after hours to make sure ever went smooth with the final purchase. I really appreciated that he took the time to make sure our needs and wants were met. Now that we have been driving the car for several months we love the car and get so many compliments on the orange color.

About a month ago we noticed some moisture in the back tail light. We called to see what could be done to fix this problem. They were able to fit us into the schedule that week and get us a new tail light installed for no cost. I like to know that they are able to take care of their customers and make them feel good about their purchase.

I will definitely return to south coast mitsubishi for my next car purchase.<//Review>

This is the second car I purchased from South Coast Mitsubishi.  I love my car, and the service here is great.  They go out of their way in the Service Department.  I got my first oil change at no charge even though I went over the miles.  I am very grateful.< /review>

Got the approval back but instead of the 3k i was going to put down they wanted 9,200 down. Lol i just picked up and left. I got approved for the same car 2 days later at 2,500 down with only 10k more miles and around the same price.

I bought a new outlander sport 4wd this last week. As a woman I always feel unprepared to do big things like buy a car and in this case, also trade in a car. But the team at the South Coast Mitsubishi were not pushy and they wanted me to test drive as many cars as I like. Negotiations for my trade in were not anything scary and I actually got the amount I wanted. The loan process was simple and don't be afraid to ask clarification questions or have Sep explain things to you, I even called a few days later and he was very helpful. Car prices are good right now, if you are thinking to get a new car please drop on by the Mitsubishi dealership in Costa Mesa.<//Text>

This place is a joke and a half. I needed a key cause I lost mine, I go there get a key they don't tell me it needs to be programed. I leave the car won't start. This is Friday evening. Now I can't get it programed till Monday. Monday I go back to dealership and I'm told the car has to be there in order to program key.  I can't get car there cause it won't start with the key I purchased on Friday.  I have to now tow the car to dealership. Rediculous. This is now my third trip. They should have informed me this the first time.
Unhappy.</review>

I took my car in for an oil change. I noticed the next day that they had taken off my license plate frames, which had the dealership I had bought my car at, and replaced it with ones with their own name on it, without even saying anything. This is not ethical, and I was very upset. I called them to ask them for my frames back and they said they would look for them and call me back. Never called. I called again. Said he was out of office and would call me back. Still to this day has not returned my calls. This is very unprofessional and totally wrong. In addition, I wanted to get my car looked at because the alignment was off, and they said that I had to authorize them $320 to look at it and wouldn't give a clear explanation as to why it was so expensive (normally at a dealership it's around $120), except to say that that way they could do what they needed to do on the car without having to call me to update me or ask my permission. But they didn't have an answer to what they would have to do that would cost that much. It sounded very weird, plus, of course the owner of the car should always be called and updated as to everything that is happening and going on with their vehicle. Very shady. I took it in elsewhere that same day and they looked at it for free, rotated one tire and problem solved. Lastly, my car has been making weird noises since getting the oil changed at South Coast MItsubishi. I am taking it somewhere else to get it looked at, though.<//Review>

This was the best car leasing experience. The guys at South Coast Mitsubishi were amazing!!! They figured out a great deal for my new 2020 Outlander Sport. I was extremely pleased with all of them . Thank you all.</Review>

<Text>Adrian was awesome.  one of the best salesmen that I've ever had to deal with in any environment.  I found a car that i wanted online, I reached out to check it's availability, and confirmed that it was there.  setup a visit to take it for a test drive.  Adrian suggested that I call or text before I come out to see if it was still available.

I sent him a text message when I was on my way.  He responded immediately, informing me that the car was sold the night prior.  He did not wait for me to get there, he told me up front.  I went to the dealership anyway, and met Adrian as I pulled up.  He pulled up his inventory, and showed me what he had.  Although, I did not get the car I wanted, I was very happy with the car I got.  He was not forceful, very patient.  I had a few other dealerships that I was going to look at, and he let me go without hassle.

I let him know that I was on my way back, he got me a good deal to bring the cost of my new (to me) car down to match the car I initially went there for.

All in all, I didn't get what I wanted.  I got better.

Thank you, Adrian.< /Text>< pictures>

I very disappointed how this place do business and mostly with who ever the manager of this branch I bought a car back on June 26,2020 and up today January 2021 I still did not receive the plates form my car knowing That I paid the registration fees and the DMV fees , the issue here that I have been calling every single day for the past 11 days to speak with the manager and for some reason every day he is busy and he will return my call .. never happened and never called me back !!! Every time the caller said I will mark it urgent .. Posting this on google and giving it a chance for an answer before getting into legal action against this place .</Review>

<Review>We drove from San Diego and it was totally worth it! This was one of THE best car buying experiences that we’ve had. I can’t say enough about our sales guys Eric and Chad. There was no pressure at all as they don’t work on commission and it actually felt like they wanted to help us by giving us a good deal. They were so patient with us and just genuinely nice guys. We ended up financing with them because they gave us a great rate. Once we met with Sep, the finance guy, he actually called the bank while we were signing papers and got us an even better rate that covered the warranty. He went out of his way to do that! What other dealership would do that? Please go see them if you’re looking for  a car!< /Review>< pics>

<text>So I dislike car shopping and going through this process but from the moment I called this place regarding a car I wanted, Adrian was super welcoming and caring, so that inspired to go in person and check it out. I had no intentions of buying since I had other options but Adrian really made it comforting from the beginning, he really wants you to drive home happy as so did Sam, he was also VERY helpful and pleasant. Customers assume the dealer is the bad guy but not this one, they work with your budget and your needs, the owner as well was a super cool guy. Im really grateful for all them helping me get a car that Im very happy with. Big shout out to Adrian because I wouldn't of drove away with a car if it weren't for him, beside being great at his job, he is a great person and at the end of the day that's what will help any business prosper :)< /text><rate>5</rate>< gmap_id>

I wanted to purchase some clips for my Mitsubishi. I had emailed them several of times with no reply, shorlty after i decided to call, the receptionist would transfer me to parts and am unsure if parts was having problems with thier phone but they were unable to hear me and would just hang up. Called  multiple times and got nowhere. Still no email reply. Difficult to get in touch with parts.</Review>

Don't get the extended warranty!!! Whatever you do. Don't get it, or see if you can get it somewhere else. I got it but now am trying to get rid of it. It's been 4 months! I also requested to have it removed less than a month or so after purchasing the car. So be aware of that. Also, the heater in my car doesn't work. So yeah. Be aware.
UPDATE: Its been 7 months now and they haven't canceled my extended warranty. I might have to start seeking legal advice on what to do here.<//review>

DO NOT BUY A TESLA FROM THEM. They buy the showroom samples, used or refurbished  with the minimum upgrades, they up-sell you promising with a full package that is not on it. Please ask them to print you out the package that comes with and write it on the contract. They will never do that. I purchased the Tesla-2018 with 100 miles and found out directly from "Tesla" the car didn't come with the standard upgrades that the crook car dealer promised. I was so upset and the very next day I asked them to take the car back and they didn't. I even offered to give them $2000 to take it back, and they didn't. I am left with no choice to take them to court and handle this the legal way.
This Tesla will cost me at least 10K more than a new Tesla from "Tesla" now since I will have to upgrade it. If you are in search of a good deal and like to save a little money, go to "Tesla" store directly and ask for sales rep to search for "the showroom special deal inventory"  you can get the car for at least 5K cheaper as first person buyer with all the incentives. That's what they do too. I am Persian, these people are Persian too, sad to see this, getting scammed and screwed from my own people. But this will not be the end of it, I will make sure they will not scam another person again. I will take them to court!</text>

This place is ran by con artist, they won't return my almost $4000 refund from an extended warranty I canceled over a year ago. They constantly give the run around and the person in charge of those checks is constantly off or on vacation. DO NOT SHOP AT THIS DEALERSHIP and if you do do not get into a situation where they'll owe you a large refund because you won't get one.< /review>

Jose at South Coast Mitsubishi is the MAN! I had a serious fiasco after I lost the key to my rental car and was advised to have my car towed to a Mitsubishi dealer. While there, the service team ran into some snags while attempting to recreate a key for me. A corrupted piece of software in the car was the issue. Damn new software keys! Jose and his team were relentless in solving this issue for me all while being communicative, honest, responsive, proactive and courteous as one can be. Lesson: Don’t lose the key to your car, but if you do, you have to take it to Jose and the fine folks at South Coast Mitsubishi!</Text>

<Review>Brought in my 2010 Lancer Evolution for service after previous dealer royally screwed it up. Best service I'd received at a dealership bar none, corrected the problems it had, and didn't charge me for things I thought I needed when I didn't. Could have been very easy for them to overcharge me for something I didn't need since I was under the impression they were before bringing it in. I'd recommend this place to anyone.< /Review></record>

<review>They are great and fast with paperwork. I was able to purchase a car off this lot using the fair app...it was easy and quick to get...and the best part is that I didn’t have to get a loan from the bank.<//review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I purchased a vehicle in January 2019. I purchased the vehicle and about a month later I got a call stating that I had to bring the car in because "I purchased the car too fast" and I didn't allow them to do the smog test. I told them I did not want to do business with them anymore, then they started ignoring me. I sold the vehicle in June and requested for the extended warranty to be cancelled, and as of today, I have literally emailed them more than 10 times (Nery, Sep, another woman), called more than 16 times, and they keep telling me they will send a cancellation form and they just don't do it. They are thieves. Do not feed their pockets!!!

UPDATE 10/14/2019:
Still haven't received my check. Nery said multiple times that she sent it and that I have to wait ten days every time she "sends one" because that's policy. I will report them to Mitsubishi corporate and I will file a complaint at the small claims office.

UPDATE 11/4/2019:
I spoke to Mitsubishi Corporate and they told me that South Coast Mitsubishi is an independent dealership, and corporate cannot do anything about my situation. I have already reported this dealership at BBB a few months back, and still haven't received my money.< /Review>

<text>Went in a few days ago and was interested in a Lancer ES. I met a salesman named Kevin and right away he helped me with everything I needed and got me straight to test driving the vehicle. Got back, tried financing and there were just issues with the bank and they were taking forever. We waited a few hours and they were trying their hardest on getting me financed. As we waited Kevin offered me and my father some snacks and it was just so nice. Kevin told me he was going to make sure to get me in this vehicle no matter what. The bank was still taking a while so we had to wait a day. Next day came and I got a call and it all worked out! Went in signed papers and drove off the lot in a brand new 2017 Lancer! Kevin was an awesome salesman and I've never met a salesman like him! He got me in the car and did his job amazingly! Thank you South Coast Mitsubishi! Couldn't be any happier!< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Needed to fix recalled air bags. I am absolutely shot at what excellent Professional Service that I received. Because of Paul in the maintenance department, I may get another Mitsubishi. He has the best personality and the most kindness of any employee I've encountered in my 60 some years of being a consumer. Paul impressed me with every task and moment I was there.</Review><date>1533514308479<//date><response>None< /response>< Pictures>

Got a beautiful used 2010 Prius with low mileage for a very good price through Albert Kumar, who was very professional, knowledgeable and courteous.  He took me for a thorough test drive at my request on the streets and highway (excellent driver, BTW), and agreed to deliver it to my residence the following week at no charge.  Then the car was delivered with an inch-wide  chip in the windshield.  (My husband put Gorilla glue  & then strong clear plastic tape on both sides and it's been fine ever since. But 1 star for that.) Beware the gap insurance and extended warranty refund process (1 star for that) but the car runs great and is great on gas.  Very happy with the purchase.< /review>

<review>I've been twice before had good experience. I would prefer to have car serviced at the dealer but they want to charge $20 more than other placed for the oil change. They have honoured it in the past. But this time they chose to yell at me on the phone and turn a customer away over $20. That is kind of sad. I was also told that the price I was giving them wasn't right yet I have an email from Nov from them showing the price.< /review>< Resp>

Came in for an AIRBAG recall and WATER PUMP REPLACEMENT for a 2006 Mitsubishi Truck back in Oct2018. Kept me informed along the process and even gave me a loaner car since part replacement was coming from elsewhere. Highly recommended to all Mitsubishi owners! Awesome and outstanding customer service led by Mr. Rigo LaFontaine!<//text>

<review>I initially visited to see if I could get my Mitsubishi checked, then I started looking at Lancers.. I was greeted by a salesman, he wasn't too great.  Then he introduced me to the inventory manager? His name was T I believe.

Wow...this place is incredible!
Don't go anywhere else!!
They are very kind, patient and the car selection is large.
Even if you're not in the market for a Mitsubishi they have so many other makes and models to choose from!!!<//Review>

After trying to get some numbers, the manager was getting frustrated and didn't agree with my method of shopping around different dealerships and getting numbers for comparisons.

This dealership should learn a thing or two about honesty and respect. Giving lectures and yelling at your customers is no way to do business.< /Text></record>

This is one of the best dealership I have been too and will keep coming back to them because I bought my Ralliart from them and I had a great 8 month run with it! Sad to say I was involved in a accident and I was side swiped by some idiot and my car became a total lost! So I call up Sam Smash and he has been very helpful and understanding with my situation that he has worked his very best to get me a awesome deal with a new car so I can get back up on my feet with a fresh new ride! Thanks Sam!!!!!< /text>

<Review>This dealership seems to have quite the mixed reviews. I have been going to Southcoast Mitsubishi for many years now and have always been quite happy. I purchased my Mitsubishi there new in October, 2007 and have had them perform all the regular services on my car. Their service department is excellent and has always treated me courteously and professionally. And its always nice when you enter the service dept and see a familiar face. Paul has always taken care of me. He's super professional and knows how to treat the customer. I would not hesitate to recommend Southcoast and in fact have told countless people over the years how they are one of the top Mitsubishi dealerships in Southern California. I will continue to patronize them.< /Review>< date>

Jose in service has been great so far with my new purchase. A 2000 Mitsubishi Montero Endeavor.

June 11th 2020 update:

Took the Montero in for a major service. Carmen my service advisor was fantastic! A true Mitsubishi enthusiast! Very helpful. If you have Mitsubishi service needs go see her!

July 2020 update: I just picked up my Montero and it drives great! All things I asked to be fixed were fixed correctly and the first time. Carmen was very helpful and quick to respond during the whole process. I own a new Porsche and the service I received from Carmen was to the level I would expect for my new Porsche...not a 20 year old Mitsubishi. Very impressive!< /Text>

I really don't get all the bad comments!
I came for my 10 000 miles maintenance and it went flawlessly.
I had a few questions and Rigo answer all of them with a smile!
Really good experience!<//text>

<Review>Service department has always taken care of me here and when they had Huntington Beach Mitsubishi. They have always been honest and straight forward. Only down side is the waiting area isn't as comfortable as it was in Huntington Beach or other dealerships that offer complimentary items for customers.< /Review>< rating>

I walked on the lot looking for a used car; I was baited, switched to a new one and then hustled into the finance room after my test drive in a car I really wasn't sure I wanted. I eventually walked after being interrogated for an hour. That's when the trouble really started - I have been barraged with emails about this skanky dealership ever since and have called and asked them, politely to remove my name, which they have never done. I suggest, if you want a good deal on a Mitsubishi, that you find another dealership. These guys suck. Oh, and I used to sell and service cars as my living. I never, ever behaved the way these guys do.</Review>

I called in last night with some questions about a particular new Mitsubishi Outlander that I was interested in purchasing. I'm not from California, and rather than purchasing locally I heard that The Sourth Coast dealership had some great prices and incentives. The rep that I spoke with was awesome! Very helpful and answered all my questions (other than pricing, which he was going to get back to me on). On the website, many of the vehicles don't have a price, but state 'Please Call'.

I hadn't heard from the rep today, so I call to follow up. The rep that answers the phone was extremely rude, and never gave me a chance to speak. He insisted that I look online for pricing, and after explaining that their website directs guests to call, he just throws out a price that was far higher than expected and says they only sell the sticker price.

I call back later to speak with a different rep (Vincent), and had a very similar experience. I was told that as I wasn't coming in immediately I was wasting his time, and the rep would not give me an idea of the price of the vehicle. Again, he directed me to look online, and after getting a little irritated I explained that their website doesn't offer pricing for the models I was looking for. He resisted completely in giving me any idea of where their prices range. I asked to speak with the employee I first spoke to, and was rudely told that he doesn't work there.

I felt really excited to work with this company in the beginning, but I wouldn't make a purchase from them now - awful customer service.</Text>

Horrible experience. Drove 45 minutes for a test drive when we get there it took about 20 minutes just to get some help even though it was not busy at all I was the only customer there. Once we get going on the test drive the car stalls in the middle of the road! Turns out someone did not put gas in the car! So im sitting in the middle of the road with my pregnant wife and 4 year old for about 30 minutes! It was really hot for my wife and daughter and the embarrassment we went through is unacceptable! People passing honking yelling out things! So when we finally get back to the dealer and we talk about numbers they wouldn't even drop the price on the car $50!! Not even for the inconvenience or anything! I was prepared to pay cash for the car. This is not how you do business! I do not recommend this dealer to anyone! Stay away!!!<//text>

If I could give one star I would.
4 months and still no registration from DMV. They never had the title of the car that was sold to me. Now I have to drive the car illegally with no license plate. God knows when I can get the title and registration. Will probably have to sue them to get things squared.</Text>

I just cant believe that Mitsubishi is still making business here in the U.S. they dont have customer service at all, From sales to service all  reps have very poor performance. Sales staff are rude, service dept is the same and acts like they dont want to do warranty work at all..Very Very Very unproffesional and unhelpful. Too bad Im stuck with their POS car and i will have to deal with this awful dealer for a while my car is under warranty which they hate working on. Will never buy a mitsubishi again.  I hope corporate office can see this review.< /Review>

took it back and the parts manager was being a real Jackass
He then refused to get the right part.
I Strongly recommend going to Huntington Beach Mitsubishi
for parts. Faster and easier.</Review>

<text>Drive past allllll those other dealerships and come down to south coast Mitsubishi! I can not tell you how great of an experience I had today. Sam smash is the man, he got me in a 2017 mirage at an amazing price, even though my credit wasn't perfect, he can do wonders! The owner even came out and personally thanked me. All those negative reviews have to be BS. If you want a great car buying experience give them a try, no pressure , no BS, no games, no bait and switch, just honest, quick, amazing service. They did not even try it up sale me on anything just gave me what I wanted and I drove away happy.!!!! Thanks again SouthCoast Mitsubishi!!!< /text><Name>shadowman88523</Name>< Rate>

Sam and Albert kumar are the main guys you want to talk to for the deals. The rest of staff are friendly, and the area is very clean well maintained.  If you have any problems in your car, they will take care of you. Great service compare to keys van nays . They are god damn awful. just awful. I drive a EVOX sup!< /Review>

I was here today (July 31-2018) for oil and filter change, check my tires and rotate them and check the brakes and they did great job and friendly staff - GREAT JOB
..............................
I bought my car here on November 2016!!!
On May 2017 I took my car for oil change and I complained about my tires and breaks too, but they send me home without fixing the problem in my tires and breaks and they told me there is nothing wrong with my tires and breaks and come back in 3-4 months. I went back to the dealer after 3-4 months and they told me again there is nothing wrong with the wheels and they sent me home!!! But still have the same issue and getting worst. I went to my mechanic and after he drove my car he said there is problem with bull-brings in all 4 wheels, and he asked me why the dealer didn't fix the problem?? I told him they sent me home twice!! he told me to go back to the dealer and ask them to use your warranty to fix it. Now I think why they were sending me home all these time.< /text>

< Review>
I bought an Evo X here and these guys were sneaky. They tried to sneak in a $5000 mark up into the contract after we had agreed that it will not be marked up. They hurried me up to sign the papers and tried not to let me look at it. We left after we had figured this out! 2 weeks later they called us back and apologized and said they will sell it for what we agreed on. So we got the car and were promised 3 free Oil change. First oil change I came in for I didn't get charged a single penny for it. Second *free* oil change I came in for I got charged a $13.64 fee for disposal and waste. Wasn't it supposed to be Free? I am not coming back for the 3rd Oil change because I am thru with this sneaky dealership. I will most definitely not be recommending this place to family or friends and I of course will not be return to finance anymore cars in the future.

Stay away from this dealership and go somewhere else guys.<//Review>

This dealer is full of s##t I went in Wednesday night to check out a pre owned vehicle they said will call u tomorrow (Thursday) Thursday come along and I get get no call. So I called about 3 times and spoke to sam. Sam said someone else has ur file they'll call you friday. Friday comes along and no one calls, I call and talk to zeth or zep he said ill give u a call back and never did.so I called back ans they tell me I didn't get approve I need a co signer.

Worst dealership. Walked in and didn't get any kind of greeting, then I had to walk up to a "salesman" to ask for help and he tried asking a different person if they could me. That other person was clearly not doing anything and said he couldn't at the moment.
I test drove a vehicle and I asked all the questions. The salesman had no personality and was not engaging at all, he acted as if it was an inconvenience to his agenda.

I can't believe that this dealer will be in business much longer, the place is messy and unorganized so you would think they would over compensate with excellent skills and service. Clearly not the case.

I wish them luck, but the lack of talent and service which should be at the core of their business is absolutely missing.</Text>

Seems like they're not very organized, & the place is not as clean & modern as other dealerships. This didn't really bother me that much, except they insisted that my Mom's car needed the synthetic oil, which was over $60. Also wouldn't honor a coupon that was expired for a couple months, which most places will do. After examining the coupon the next day, the coupon for the synthetic oil change was for $25, discounted from $35, so I don't understand why it was $60 for us? I spoke with 1 other friend who's been here, & they had a similar bad impression.< /text>

By far the worse car buying experience Ive ever dealt with. Salesperson started off great, good attitude very polite, but after we got down to business and I ask him some questions that required intelligent answers, things started to change (I'm a very knowledgeable car buyer) . They lied to me about what the bank offered me in terms of APR, he gave me a monthly at $533.78 but when I asked him to do the math in front of me on how he got those numbers with that APR they couldn't do it and plus it didn't add up.  This is a trick these guys use to get you to sign without reading what the APR really is. I ended up talking to the bank when they called to verify my income/job and I was approved at a  lower APR then what the dealer told me. So by jacking up my APR, the dealer stood to make even more money off me.

I walked out and felt really insulted by the lack of professionalism and respect to its customer. I would never ever recommend spending a dime there.</Text>

I purchased my Evo X from SC Mitsu.  The expierence was nice as the salesmen worked with me to get the car I wanted and offered me a number of options.  The service department has actually been really awesome lately.  While I do have some expensive repairs in the near future they were transparent and did their best to help me.  In the past I did feel less inclined to have my car serviced there but my last visit was awesome and I really felt like I was 120% informed on my servicing which means a lot.  I would purchase another Evo if Mitsu gets back in the business of performance cars and I would buy it at South Coast.<//Review>

I am a upmost and firm believer  that any business to be successful starts at customer service.This place raises the bar!

Bought my first Outlander Sport (crossover) and the whole process was just amazing. I was not pushed to buy I came in one day to look at the car. Told the Salesmen I just want to check out the car take it for a test drive because I am shopping around.

He had no problem with that. Actually told me that I want you to know that we are the best at what we do when it comes to longevity , warranty, and just over all solid car. I did my shopping and well he was right! I came right back i walked out the door with a brand new Outlander Sport for 22k! I could not be happier with the car and my experience.

So over all I would give South Coast Mitsubishi 10/10</review>

Being that my credit is less than perfect, its hard to get approved for a vehicle and at a decent price. When I contacted South coast Mitsubishi, they promised they could get me approved. I live in Fresno and could not get a decent rate on a used or new car, every dealer in Fresno wanted to sell me there bottom line no bells or whistles car for an outrageous price. So in good faith I took the Amtrak to Costa Mesa and met up with Roobik at the dealership. It wasn't 10 minutes before I was able to tell the helpful staff what I wanted and they delivered. I drove home in a brand new Lancer, THE ONE THAT I WANTED!!!! I cant thank South Coast Mitsubishi enough for what they were able to pull out of their magic hat for me. Roobik and the helpful staff at South Coast Mitsubishi have a new life customer.</text>

<Review>Every time I read negative reviews I believed the people were irrational or they should’ve been more careful. Well I never thought I would be the person leaving a negative review. I bought a Mini Cooper and 15 days later there was a loud grinding noise. I took it to the dealership and they told me there was nothing they could do; they actually blamed me for breaking the part. At one point I was threaten that if I didn’t pick up the car they would start charging me for storage. I picked up the car and drove it all the way home going no more than 25 mph. They couldn’t even fix my car in good faith that I did not damage the clutch and that perhaps it was sold to me in a deteriorating condition. It would come to no surprise that this is the type of culture this business supports.</Review>< Pics>

My experience started out fine, I met with a seemingly friendly and knowledgeable salesman (Jonathan) and test-drove a used 2000 honda civic.  There were a few minor problems, but he quoted my a great price.  When we got back, it ended up being 1300 bucks more than he said it would be...after an hour and a half of negotiating he got it down to the price he said, but by then I felt cheated and decided not to take the deal.  At that point they send out a closer guy (who, honestly looked like a mechanic they just took from the back).  This guy was basically yelling at me for not taking the car and told me, quote "You don't even deserve this car!!!"  I just turned around a walked out.  In the car back home I got a call apologizing and asking if I was satisfied.....really?  I ended up in tears I was so frustrated.<//text>

<Review>Worst experience with any dealership by far. I called asking about pricing on a few vehicles that been listed online as "please call". Upon speaking with a very unprofessional sales person whom I could barely understand, not only would he not give me any pricing, he told me all the vehicles would be sold at 3500 over msrp. Yes 2014 Evolutions will be $3500 over msrp. Weird that they are not budging on price, no wonder its 2015 and they still have 2013's in stock. Anyway he refused to give me what the MSRP actually was and demanded that I go online to fill out a credit app. I told him I was an out of state cash buyer and he still would not give me any numbers, only told me that I would be paying far more then any other dealer in the country.

I asked to speak with a manger who answered the phone with a "yes hello". No name introduction or anything. I introduced myself and told him the situation. He reiterated the same nonsense that the previous sales guy had stated but said he would check his stock on the specific packages and get right back to me. It was around 10am when I spoke to him and close of business that very day I was still yet to receive a call back. No email follow up, nothing. Very disappointed. Not only was their pricing off the charts outrageous, their customer service was down right HORRIBLE.

Save yourself the headache and go anywhere else but here.<//Review><rating>1</rating></record>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>It seems my review from 4 years ago was deleted. I had a bad buying experience here and want to repost this review because when I went in, it was very clear that I was Active Duty Military. This dealership was very happy to take advantage of an Active Duty Military car buyer and I want to put this up for visibility and a warning to my fellow service members. Over 4 years later and I was never contacted by the dealership. Original review below.

On September 16th I called South Coast Mitsubishi and told them I was interested in coming down and looking at a 2007 Toyota Tacoma Prerunner they had in their stock. I showed up later at around 6:00pm and test drove the truck. During the test drive the salesman informed me about the passenger side speaker not working and ensured me this issue would be fixed if I were to purchase the vehicle. When we got back from the test drive I told him I wanted to purchase the vehicle and would be paying cash for it but I had to wait for a check to clear to pay the whole vehicle in full so I paid with a $10,000 check. Before finalizing the sale he asked me if there were any other issues with the truck I had noticed, I informed him that there was a large chip in the driver side door and he ensured me this issue would be fixed when I picked up the truck next week. I also asked him if he could open the tonneau bed cover so I could look inside, he went inside the dealership to look for the key and came out and said there was no key and they would have to make one, again this was ensured to be done by the time I picked up the vehicle. I arrive on September 22nd to pay the remainder due on the vehicle, after signing all the papers and finalizing the sale, the truck is driven out to me. Upon a quick examination it is apparent all the issues that were ensured to be fixed were not resolved, not only that but the truck had about 2 gallons of fuel. It was clear this truck had sat neglected. All I asked for was to replace the key for the tonneau bed cover that was not given on date of purchase, repair the broken speaker and fix the chip in the paint. It can be noted that for almost a month and many phone calls later, these issues had not been addressed with no steps made by the dealership to fix this issue. All I asked for was the key but now due to the formal complaint process I have to share my whole experience. My five years in the military and three deployments have never shown this much negligence before.

<Review>I needed a new car badly and I was looking for a deal. I needed something good on gas but I'm a big guy so I wanted a bigger car or smaller SUV. I did some digging on AutoTrader and came across South Coast Mitsubishi (SCM) because they had a few 2013 Outlander Sport models left at an amazing discount. So on Thursday I inquired online to see if the vehicle was still there. A short time later I received an email and text response from Sam Smash. It was his day off but he verified that the vehicle was still available and told me that he'd be in contact the next day.

On Friday Sam texted me to let me know that he was in. I responded inquiring about financing. For the next few hours we worked out a deal completely through e-mail and text. I didn't feel any pressure at all. Sam was patient and understanding with my hectic schedule and the fact that I wasn't able to come in right away. The next day I'd promised to come in but had a work emergency and couldn't make it.

Finally on Sunday I went in. Sam told me that everything was done and that all they needed was my signature. I felt that the deal was too good to be true so I was a bit apprehensive. I've had some bad experiences in the past but SCM was top notch. The car was as advertised, the deal was exactly what had been determined over text and email, and they gave me exactly what we discussed on my trade-in. The paperwork was fast and easy with no crazy upsells or hustles. I kept waiting for the curveball but it never came.

I happily drove away in my NEW (but 2013) Mitsubishi Outlander Sport with all the bells and whistles for a drastic discount. When I compared what I was paying to what was on the sticker I felt like I was getting away with something, and I did, I got away with a smoking deal. I have nothing but good things to say about Sam, about my salesman Kevin, and about South Coast Mitsubishi. I highly recommend them.<//Review>< pics>

Not a customer but these people somehow gained access to our phone number and have been calling us repeatedly. Uh, hey, morons, we know how to find automobiles without being harassed by a barrage of uninvited phone calls.

It's called the internet. You know, that same "thing" that we're using to post this feedback

From my business perspective, any retail business that is so desperate for business that they would one, go to great lengths to obtain your personal data and, two, constantly harass prospective auto buyers with these unsolicited phone calls, would not be a business we would want to patronize or even consider. \

Fyi, we have never been to South Coast Mitsusbushi, or any Mitsubushi dealer for that matter, nor have we ever had any contact with any Mitusbushi iron lot including this one.

Pathetic.<//Review>

<Name>Chris Alexan<//Name><Text>The only reason it's getting a 5 star is because of Mr. Sam Smash that took care of me. DO NOT I repeat do not go to south coast and deal with alen or tj. They will try to screw you. I sat there for 4 hours just to be turned away because of a mistake THEY made. Went to Sam immediately after and everything flowed perfectly. Not only did he make the experience pleasurable, he is extremely knowledgeable about all the cars at mitsubisi. I left home in an evo with a giant smile on my face and I couldn't be happier.</Text>< pictures>

Fair sales person, very poor management and business ethics!  I was approved for $16k and wanted a $10k car.  On the night I was to pick up the car, I was told that it did not pass smog. Hard to believe since its an 2003 Acura.  They wanted me to buy a $13k car, so I called the Long Beach mitsubishi where the Acura was located, AND NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH IT!! Now they are taking their sweet time refunding my deposit on my credit card......So I went to Newport Lexus and got a CPO IS300.< /review>

All my cars have been Mitsubishi and I've always brought them to this location for service. A few months ago I made a bad decision and got a Ralliart 2014 as a lease, not knowing exactly what I was getting into. Long story short, I was in a situation where I could not meet the insurance requirements and was about to lose the car for that reason. I thought there was no way out and was out of options and out of hope. Eric Rayle sat down with me, without rush, listened to my concerns, researched the options and in the end I left with two new Outlanders that I could afford and got out of the bad lease. I say "bad" because I didn't read everything the way I was supposed to. Eric went the extra miles to make sure my family and me would be ok again, and happy. He took care of all the paperwork and solved all our problems. I would recommend Eric Rayle and Southcoast Mitsubishi to anyone who needs not just a salesman, but someone who cares about returning, loyal customers. It's true experiences may vary, but sometimes professionals get unfair, negative reviews even when they did all they could to help out. I hope my review, a drop in the ocean, helps more people out there become aware of Eric's commitment, efficiency and professionalism.<//Text>

The needle on evos tend to have a bit of play, but mine didn't have that little movement, mine was bouncing between 1.5-2k rpm. And that is usually associated with either the vac line or maf sensor. Anyways, so I call these guys and asked the person if they knew about this problem (almost certain they do) and the guy on the phone acknowledged it, so I continued to ask about what maybe is causing it and that I limited it down to really 2 or 3 reasons why my needle would be bouncing like that. Then all he kept telling me was I had to bring it in. I told him exactly what was going on, and he still just kept saying for me to bring it in. Then he started to be rude, changing tone of voice (not that it was pleasant to begin with) and told me he had 3 people in front of him and to call back later. I'm like wtf? Instead of calling back, I took the time to let you all know to avoid this place. I tried to buy a car here months ago before I gave it another chance and tried to call in for some help on service. Back in June when I was looking for an evo, the manager I was in contact with told me they had the car I wanted, I drove 2 hours, showed up. They told me they sold my car, so sorry. Then they proceeded to try and sell me used ones or much more expensive ones.

This dealership looks very shady. Very cold inside, guys that look like they will mess someone up for talking bad about them. I went there just wanting to test drive the new Outlander, but nope. Went straight to the table and they got my credit score, it wasn't as great and quoted my car i currently have very low for a 2013, and didn't even bother to look at it seeing as I was going to use it as a trade. When they seen my credit score wasn't great, they shoved me off and I didn't even test drive the car. They even shared a lot with some other small bit dealer. It felt very unsettling right when I pulled up. I wouldn't go here, go to another well known Mitsubishi dealer.<//review>

So rude and by far the worst experience I've ever had at a dealership. They constantly try to rip you off at every corner, even the manager is a major jerk. Avoid this place at any cost!</review>

(Translated by Google) Paul is most professional. His honesty and dedication is why I drive the 45 minutes to South Coast Mitsubishi from my home. I fully recommend it.

Paul es de lo más profesional. Su honestidad y dedicación es la razón por la que manejo desde mi casa los 45 minutos a South Coast Mitsubishi. Lo recomiendo completamente.< /Text>

I have been using Dennis George Automotive for 20+ years.  They are professional, helpful, honest, friendly and provide excellent work.  They keep you informed about your vehicle with an inspection result, via email, using the “3 color” system.  Green - good, Yellow - the following areas need future attention, and Red - the following areas need attention now.  This is extremely helpful so you can keep your vehicle in great shape without any unexpected surprises.  Keeping you posted, on when your vehicle will be ready for pick up, is helpful so you can plan your day.  😊</review>

< review>
We found Dennis George Automotive through AAA. And so glad that they came through for us as our car broke down on the north side of the 395 on our way to a mini vacation driving up to Bishop. It was spewing steam everywhere. We were towed to Dennis George and they promptly diagnosed the problem as a cracked radiator, replaced the part and tested the radiator. They also drive us to Denny’s so we waited in a comfy booth as our car was being serviced. We were so grateful that they were there for us. We were still able to redeem the vacation and drove on to Bishop. Thanks again!!!!< /review>

<rating>4< /rating><text>Generally great service! I liked the photo-based feedback of car’s service status. I added rotation of tires, and the technician also pumped up my tires’ pressure...but he probably did not also check my spare, which caused my car tire pressure warning light to come on while on my trip the next day.  A slight annoyance.
I’ll be coming back again for my car’s service needs.</text>< pictures>

< Review>
These guys were really nice I wanted to make sure my vehicle was ok to take up camping over the weekend and so I had them do a general inspection so I could have some peace of mind and know what I need to look out for. Long story short they reassured me that my vehicle was in no dire need and that it would be fine to take on the trip. They're inspections come with a simple but thorough checklist with included pictures of any trouble areas. Thanks to Al for keeping in touch and to the rest of you guys for doing a great job.< /Review>

<review>When anything goes wrong or we need regular maintenance, we always call Dennis George. We trust that we're getting excellent service at a reasonable price. They've handled our "fleet" of family cars for decades and we're grateful for quick times and advice that benefits our needs rather than their bottom line.<//review>< Time>

I like the text messaging and so far after picking up my Benz I had extra cash to get a Big Mac...I don't give 5stars 4.5

< Review>
After breaking down on CA395 on a Sunday, we were towed to Dennis George for repairs - which were done  quickly the following day. They were very sensitive to the fact that we were on a road trip and needed to resume travel as soon as possible. Everyone we interacted with was cautious (covid), courteous and very helpful. They turned our “bump in the road” into a tolerable side adventure 👍<//Review>

<Text>When it's 3pm on a Friday, you're in from out-of-town, and you need to head back home later in the weekend, you don't expect much luck when your 1999 Toyota Land Cruiser develops a whine in the engine.

However, Jeff at Dennis George Automotive not only came out to diagnose the issue, he sourced the replacement, part and then came in on his day off to ensure that we were able to continue our travel plans without missing a beat.

This is a type of excellence in customer service that you dream about and you are so lucky to have here.

While your situation may not be as dire as ours, I believe that you will be just as satisfied with the service and professionalism.</Text>< Pictures>

My hippy daughter’s 1981 VW Vanagon was no exception.  Thought it was the starter zapping the battery but turned out to be some bad wiring.  Had the van for 2 weeks or so.  Charged $170.  Got her good as new.  Thanks again “pit crew”🥰<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

They're 1 of 2 auto repair shops I would reccomend to others. While their initial qoute may sound pricey compared to others, it is worth it. You get thorough, quality service from friendly professionals. I can't reccomend them enough.<//Review>< Pics>

<text>My first experience with Dennis George Automotive was in 2011, after my do-it yourself brake job had gone horribly wrong. They did such a great job repairing my mess for an amazing price. I had heard horror stories of mechanics taking advantage of people and as a single mom, I needed someone trustworthy and honest. I found them! Every time I have needed anything from an oil change to complicated problems with my hybrid, they have done an incredible job. I highly recommend them!!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

It's a very nice park with great views.  Only downside I can think of is the parking.  Only 12 spots.</Text>

Park is in need of major updating compared to other parks in neighboring cities. It's also messy with all the leaves, it doesn't look like they pick them up at all. Rubber is peeling up in multiple places on the playground floor. The bathrooms need soap. Hoping they update soon.<//Review>

<text>I haven't been able to find another place with better deals on produce.  Great value for what I need.  Some may question it's freshness but I cook a lot, and for the prices, it fills the need to save.  There are good value choices in meat also.  The basic grocery items are usually of average cost you see elsewhere.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80c2cbcc8f676817:0xa5d8f27de4cb4110</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<time>1562896871670<//time><rating>1< /rating><review>They advertised chicken wings for $1.89 a pound, Thursday only. Also 138 oz. Tide laundry detergent for $6.99. Of course they had neither item. The butcher & manager said they were all out if both items. So the sale for the laundry detergent is on until Tuesday of next week.  That is False Advertisement?</review>< pictures>

We stayed at camp James about 3 years ago and really enjoyed the place. The staff is very friendly and the place itself was very laid back and fun.<//Review>

< Review>
We live here and are amazed at how quiet it is inside the park even though we are in a population-dense city.  You would never guess!  We also appreciate how well kept the grounds are, larger-than-typical lots with lots of variety in the topography.  It is well managed and standards of maintenance are enforced.  Nice clubhouse facilities with many activities.  We have found the residents to be lovely.<//Review>

Love this place! Great for breakfast or that afternoon pick me up. It can get pretty packed on the weekends so don't plan on being able to find somewhere to sit.</Text>

<Text>Always come ti this location its closest to my home. But on this day the wait time took longer than usual. I saw everyone that was in line behind me get their orders first. I asked why didn't everyone else behind me in line got their other first? One of them said its because "they do the easiest orders to prepare first" and leave the harder ones till after.
Which is weird because I saw people obtaining their Frappuccino drinks before me, that were in line to order way after me.😑
All the other times being at the riverside VanBuren/ Arlington location they have always been super nice and friendly</Text><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dcb13320891187:0x49f87a7ebdfeaf4< /GmapID><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

<review>I wish I got their names. The two baristas that were there were awesome! I had to run out real quick to break a $100 but they were so patient about it and still went ahead to make my drink order while I went out to Ace Cash to break the note. Then on my way out my drink fell out of the carrier and when I went back inside... Before I even finished explaining they started making me a new one 😃 BEST baristas I've encountered in a very long time. You guys made my day with how kind you both were! Keep it up!!<//review>< Pictures>

This place has probably THE WORST staff...Not sure where they find these people but without fail every Uber order I have that comes from this location ends up being wrong. It's a running joke in my office at this point. If I order a bagel toasted they send it untoasted. If I order it untoasted they toast it...EVERY...SINGLE....TIME. The label says "warmed" So I KNOW I selected the correct option yet the bagel was just shoved in the bag cold.</Review>

<Review>Location is great, easy to spot, easy to get into. Employees at the time were very wonderful. Came here with a friend, we had a great time. I ended up getting late to class but felt great catching up with friends. Only issue was she was complaining about the drink she ordered was not made correct, tasted just like sugared Milk, and after she mixed it tasted worse and had an aftertaste of popcorn. So...yah great place, however that one issue is what's stopping me from giving 5 stars.< /Review><Date>1569347995282</Date>< response>

Good: hard workers, put up with the types of people that come in, good location.

Bad: No outlets, usually super packed and dirty bc of how busy they are. Can't go here if they dont have power, plus it's too cramped. Very small.</Text>

I frequent this Starbucks often since it's down the street from my job. Overall a very good store, friendly staff, and a clean environment. The only reason why I knocked it down a star is because the parking lot gets super busy (especially in the afternoons) and it's in the same space as a busy grocery store. There also has been a small transient problem there, but nothing bad enough to stop me from getting my lattes and cappuccinos.<//text>

<Review>February 8th I bought a green tea and went outside studied for a couple hours then came in to get a refill and was denied one because I wasnt inside the lobby she said. Before I could even ask her anything she said yea its always been the rules I'll have to charge you for a whole new one. I chose to leave instead of arguing it because she obviously wanted to go home and the way she said it to me I was not sure she would even make my drink respectfully.

I go to Starbucks daily and have never ran across an employee like this. I was disappointed for the first time ever. I will choose another Starbucks to go to for better service and someone who doesn't seem irritated that I wanted a refill that I am allowed to receive!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

By far the best Starbucks in the area. There are 5 surrounding my home.  Third is the only one without a drive thru. I go to this one because I get what I ask for.  Wtg Starbucks<//Review>

Best Starbucks ever!!! Michelle and Sarah r literally the best barista's around!!! In the morning you can always count on Michelle to greet u with a smile and a "Good morning", n to top it off she remembers your order, mainly because she has taken the time to ask you (during previous trips) exactly how u want ur drink made down to the perfect amount of caramel drizzle!! Sarah too will make u feel like this Starbucks is your second home, she takes the time to get to know you along with your kids. Literally my daughter calls Sarah her "Best friend". Seriously recommend this Starbucks above all others.</review>

It doesn't have enough outlets to plug in your electronic devices. The staff didn't seem too friendly. I have only been to this Starbucks maybe twice because I've been in the area, I'll just stick to my usual place< /text>

They take so much time to do my ice cofee there was only one employee taking orders and making the drinks and the other one cleaning instead of taking care of the drinks so the cashier just focus on taking orders< /review>

I of course love Starbucks, except for the co-ed bathrooms. I am taking one star away from this one because one of the two co-ed bathrooms has been on the fritz for several days, and while the staff is keeping the other one clean it makes things difficult to have just one bathroom for everyone. This Starbucks, rather than the one in Jurupa Valley, has been my "office" for awhile because it is a more convenient location for my husband to get his Lyft rides. That does mean a higher-density neighborhood though. I also have to take one star away from the business because it is in the City of Riverside. 8.75 sales tax and a few other bad policies.< /text>

<review>The workers were very rude and ignored me. They only helped the gentleman behind me whom was light skinned and the woman next to me who was light skinned as well. This is the first time I have been treated this way in this store and this will probably be my last visit which is within 2 mins of my house.</review><user_name>Unknown Lopez<//user_name><Resp>None<//Resp>< UserId.>

<text>Do not purchase verismo!!! The starbucks stores do not have a selection of coffee pods and the pods are not sold at grocery stores like the kcups.   Starbucks doesn't have the same variety in verismo as they do for keurig cups. I'm very frustrated with the service & variety. I should be able to go to any of their locations, pick up my selected coffee & chocolate pods. They should also have the teas available. They have Starbucks teas in kcup but not verismo! It doesn't make any sense. I also used to be able to purchase & or pre order the Fontana chocolate sauce.  Now they no longer sell it to customers.  Its very frustrating. I would have never purchased this product had I know it was going to be so inconvenient.
The verismo had been a waste of money.<//text>< Pics>

Great service, the best in the area, this is by far my favorite Starbucks shop. The workers are always in a very good mood, they always greet costumers with a smile.</Review>
