<text>There's a reason for low ratings. Her name is ERICA. First person you come in contact with- rude, cold, lazy and knows nothing. Or at least acts like it. Have someone else answer calls. Horrible customer service.</text>< Pictures>

DO NOT GO HERE. I had Covid Symptoms and needed a work note. Got on a 5 minute zoom call with a "doctor" who proceed to print out a generic article about Covid 19 regulations that could be printed out by anyone. 1 month later I get a letter from my insurance. They Charged me $900 for this Zoom session. This place is a complete scam, they do not care about us, all they care about is putting money in their pocket. They are a disgrace to this community and embody everything wrong with U.S healthcare system. Do not support this urgent care.</Text>

My Experience was unbelievably unpleasant... I was not feeling well and the only place that I could get an appointment was this urgent care in Montclair my husband and I drove from San Diego and got to my appointment time 10 minutes early....When I went in to the facility she told me that I had to wait 2 1/2 hours I asked her why I made an appointment and she said It’s just the way it is because I felt really sick there was no way I was waiting 2 1/2 hours so I told her to cancel the appointment and that I would go to the ER she had an attitude didn’t seem to care never apologized and I actually felt like she was bothered That she was even at work I would never recommend this place<//Text>

This place is garbage.  Under staffed. Unprofessional. They don't pay attention to the answers I give to their questions. They sent my daughters prescription to the wrong pharmacy even after confirming which one it should go to.  Most of the signage is in Spanish.  This is not right, as our family is English speaking Americans, and we should absolutely be able to read any and everything at a doctor's office we are depending on for care.

Never coming here again. I do not trust their services treatments or expertise.  This is a hole in the wall urgent care straight out of mexico, and it's a disgrace that my tax dollars pay for this.</Review>

I wouldn’t even give this place one star! What kinda of doctor does not take her  last patient before their doors are closed. I went in to have my baby checked and was quoted “doctor is full”. This doctor has a profession and needs to be at her best services but I guess she is more worried about her time than people’s health!< /Review>

My mother was treated very poorly.  Staff including doctor are very incompetent. How do you try sending a patient home without explaining their diagnosis? Then belittle them when they have questions. Very unprofessional very unethical. I understand it’s a busy profession,  but you’re dealing with human beings who are sick and in pain putting their trust in you.  Have some compassion be caring.  Inform your patients, they shouldn’t  have to be googling their diagnosis while leaving your establishment. There might be some good staff there unfortunately my mother did not  encounter any.<//text>

< Review>
I drove from southern chino to visit this office because it said they saw patients up until closing time which is 8 pm . It’s the main reason I even considered this place as I was just barely going to make it . So I get here (I’m parked outside) and the desk lady tells me, “I’m sorry , we just took out last patient” so I said that the reason I drive out was because it says they took patients until closing time which is 8 pm and I was here at 7:45 (doors would be locked if it was closed) now I can understand that it can be rude to show up close to closing time but this is an urgent care clinic where sick people come for help. It’s not a burger stand where I’m keeping people from going home just because I want some French fries . She told me she was sorry but they got someone with a laceration so they weren’t taking anymore patients . She wasn’t rude about it or anything but clearly didn’t understand that on the website it says they take patients until closing. She didn’t even ask why I wanted to be seen 🤷🏻‍♂️

Not rude or anything but they don’t follow the policies they advertise . Disappointed  .</Review>

This office is incompetent. Was seen on Friday went to get X-rays done said it would take 2-3 days for results. Called Monday to verify if results were in and the said no but they will call me as soon as they came in. It’s Wednesday and no call. I call in they say they do have results and I have to go in and wait 3 hours to hear results. When I contact X-ray place the said the results were sent in on Sunday. I ask the receptionist why I was told they weren’t in and she says that she can’t speak for anyone else but it’s protocol to check the fax and maybe whoever helped me didn’t follow protocol. So it’s been 3 days and only one person knows how to follow protocol. That is the worst service I’ve ever received. And to top it off the report I received was signed off by the doctor with a note stating to call patient for pick up on the day they received them.< /Review>

<Review>I was very pleased with my visit to Central Urgent Medical Care. It was my first visit and they were busy with a few other patients but the staff seemed to get everyone in and out in a reasonably amount of time. The PAC knew exactly about  my condition and the rest of the staff was great. This establishment is very sanitary too.</Review>< Pics>

<text>I specifically told them I was allergic to a medicine multiple times. Then when I go to pick up my medicine the doctor prescribes me the medicine I am allergic to. I tried calling them multiple times to let them know so they can send a new prescription but they never answer their phone. Worst experience ever.<//text>< pictures>

<text>Well trained, friendly staff, clean office and low wait times make Central Urgent Care a good place to go for minor injuries and illnesses.  My wife cut her thumb rather deeply last night, and we went to Central Urgent Care as we thought it needed stitches.  The physician's assistant diagnosed and treated her quickly and thoroughly, and the entire visit only took about an hour from sign-in to exit, and there were three patients ahead of us.  Very efficient.

UPDATE:  My daughter and I went to Central Urgent Care today via Lyft ($13 round trip) on 4/12/19 and were turned away as they didn't have a doctor on staff.  This seemed strange, as it was only late afternoon.  Good thing Life Point Urgent care was open.  Its about a block south of Central Urgent Care on the same side of the street.  So my sick daughter and her disabled dad walked .2 miles and were seen at Life Point.

UPDATE 2:  My wife and I decided to give this place another try (5/16/19), as it's the closest place to home that takes our insurance.  I called before we left @ 730 PM to confirm they were open and accepting patients until 8 PM.  The recording AND the receptionist confirmed they were taking patients until 8 PM.  We arrived at 740 PM. via Lyft ($13 round trip--again) and were told their doctor was under contract and could not work past 8 PM.  We were turned away for the second time in 34 days.

We won't be going back unless it's a last resort.</text>< Time>

<review>If I could give this place 0 stars I would. ABSOLUTELY AWFUL! The front desk staff was rude from the moment I walked in. Waited in the waiting room for about 30 minutes. When I finally got called back the took my vitals and the nurse was asking the normal questions. I finally got into my room and the girl said the Dr would be in within A FEW MINUTES. AN HOUR goes by and not once did the Dr even come in my room. On top of that no one even came into my room to check in on me. I finally went back to the front desk and said what the hell? She said it was a busy and there were a few people in front of me. I walked out! Obviously they are seriously under staffed and need to hire more help because that was just completely unacceptable. Horrible, horrible office.< /review>< pics>

When I asked what it was for ,(because NP didn't even tell me I was getting meds for anything) the NP came in defensive and told me I was not listening.  "But it's ok, I'll repeat myself" was her response.  Then tells me I have not one, but two conditions which she never mentioned during the exam.  Her attitude was very rude and unprofessional.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Horrible staff. The lady who was rooming opens the door (rudely, chewing gum like a cow) and yells out patients name, and points her index finger (like if patients are animals) to where she needs them to go.... Then rolls her eyes to the entire waiting room .... Hmmmm could it be that she hates her job, pay or working on a Saturday? All of the above. How can they act so rude and careless, if it was their mom, brother, sister, aunt, uncle etc they WOULD NOT appreciate a medical staff treating them so stupid. Go back to school! Learn how to BECOME educated! BE PROFESSIONAL! grievance for sure!<//Review>

<review>I have gone there 3-4 times to basically have as many answers as I did before I came. It’s like they are afraid to prescribe anything and will divert you to the ER if it means they have to do more than just give you a general lookover. X-Ray and EGK are always unavailable. I had one of the P.A.’s basically try to make me feel like a hypochondriac for coming in, then 24 hours later going to my primary care doctor to get prescribed an antibiotic and told I had bronchitis. Save yourself 2-3 hours and some money, wait for your normal physician or hit the ER...they are going to send you there anyway.<//review>< Pics>

<review>Yes there is a long wait, but I like the doctors there. My husband and i have both been there, and both received excellent care!  If you don't want a long wait, go to an urgent care that does NOT accept medical.  They have so much time on their hands they'll tell you all about there vacations, and their families...  Don't listen to reviews written by impatient, grouchy people.  It is the flu season after all.<//review><user_id>104284776568040896756<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

This place is closed one day a year: on Christmas.  They’ve got to know that the next morning is going to be busy, right?  Well, there are literally 14 sick people waiting outside in the cold 25 minutes after opening, and the door is locked and no one is in sight inside.  Called the Rancho location to see what’s up and they were shocked to hear what’s going on here.  Are these the kind of irresponsible people you want treating your sick child?  NOT ONE OF THERE STAFF HAS SHOWN UP!!< /Review>

I took my adult son there a couple months ago, YES, it was a long wait (He's got Obamacare) But, he was seen and well taken care of.  My private insurance costs me almost $6,000/Year ($4,000-Deductible and $163-Monthly Cost).  If I could quality for free government Medical and save thousand$, I wouldn't mind the wait.</Review>

Came in for an arm injury. My elbow-forearm was swollen, they took x-rays and said it was fine & to come back 2 weeks later if it still hurts. So I came  back 2 weeks later & they took x-rays again & said I have a radial fracture! They missed it on the first x-ray! Put on a splint...then I went to the Orthopedic & he said I didn't even need a cast or splint since by now it's already going to heal itself. NEVER GOING BACK. waste of my time and money!< /Review>

Except for the doctor, everyone there was rude, did not smile, and did not show even an ounce of kindness or sympathy to anyone they spoke with. I sat in that waiting room for 2 1/2 hrs before being called. Then another hour waiting in one of the back rooms. I work with customers on a daily basis and my company would never put up with this poor customer service ethics. The other Central urgent care in Rancho Cucamonga is the complete opposite. The waiting time is short and the entire staff is so kind.</Review>

<review>Been sitting in the waiting room (with four other people) for an hour and a half.  Just got put in a room, and the NP tells me "it may be awhile, there are two or three patients ahead of you."  Seriously?  It's already been awhile!

And, there is a sign attached to the door where the nurse meets you ... "Technology must be turned off beyond this door."  Really?  You are going to make me sit for three hours and watch bad infomercials on the provided television?  I think not!!!< /review><user>104382947371152640524<//user><Name>Lisa Lowry</Name></record>

TERRIBLE! Took my three kids who were sick. I waited 2 hrs to b called and 35 mins in the room but you know what forget that. I was seeing by a student alone. Hmm ok it’s cool I was student before doing my hours too so I was not mean about that I guessed the Physician would walk in later but guess what he never did! The student was bad said my son had red in his ears and throat. The others one nothing. At least I figure bc guess what??? No actual official paper with diagnostic nor the PA walked in to talk to me about the findings a student did. I was in such a hurry and upset I didn’t talk to anyone I grabbed the RX quick and left. (That’s bc I told them I had to leave and the girl just gave me the papers and I took off) anyways as I am reading the RX they didn’t prescribe nothing for the ear infection. WTH!? Horrible horrible horrible.<//Review>

<Time>1489683792886< /Time><review>So I brought my two-year-old in today to utilize the Urgent Care part of this clinic..I mean most receptionists are a little disconnected from the patients anyways but this one in particular ...was doing the most...
As we waited, My  2 year old felt cold so I asked if we could wait in the car she said that was fine that it would take about half an hour so a little bit later I see my daughter trying to fall asleep in the car and I asked the receptionist will be possible for her to call me when it's my turn and she snickered and said no we don't do that....( keep in mind that another reception is at the same location has done this for me already.) I asked her if this was her own personal decision or a company policy and again she snickered and said no I don't do that.
I didn't say anything at the time because honestly I'm still waiting for my daughter to be seen but this is a very unprofessional behavior. I'm a worried mother and I don't feel that my request was anything out of the ordinary. That's the problem with people nowadays they have very little empathy for others. They see us all like IEHP cattle​...They have no reason to accommodate anyone<//review>< user>

(Translated by Google) After almost six months I had the need to return to this doctor's office and I must accept that the care in general has improved tremendously, you have to wait a few minutes but the attention was quite good.

2 stars for theme and cleanliness.

This was my first time here. I asked for a #2 on the side, and about an inch on top with a little more up front to style. After 30 minutes the barber was still ONLY on the sides. Once he started on the top he was only trimming about an inch off the top. I said it again what I was looking for, he seemed to get it, then the next thing you know he was taking the clippers with a #4 right down the middle! Nothing left up front to style.

When all was said and done I spent 50 minutes and $27 on a buzz cut I could have done at home!< /Text>

<Text>Very good barber shop. Their fades & tapers are very clean and crispy and they take their time. However, Erik cannot cut with scissors, If you like long hair on top I suggest you find another barber/stylist because the 2 times I have left the shop I love my hair but when I shower and try to comb it, it ends up all BUTCHERED. Will not go back< /Text>< pictures>

Great spot, plenty of barbers there that can take in on the spot, my go to barbers are gio and Miguel they do a great job I can proudly say their the best barbers in Escondido and from sitting in their chairs. The other barbers do a good job as well definitely a place I recommend anyone to get a haircut at.< /Review>

<Review>Tried this place out because the normal barber a block away had an hour wait and I was short on time.

I prefer a barber who will give you a good talk, but here they talked amongst each other and their personal struggles at home while I awkwardly sat there and listened in on behavior issues with family.

Also it was $20 for a cut while my normal place is $12. The cut was good but I don't think I'll be returning.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmapID>

<Review>The place to go.  I was trekking to Temecula for my haircuts, as there are only a few places that I have faith in their consistency.  Did I mention that, I used to cut hair; still do, but rarely.  In saying all that, I take my sons here, and as you can imagine are now pretty picky teenagers.  All Stars do a clean job on cuts, line-ups, fades, beard trims, and even their blade work.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Guy talked to me like he was one of the best and he fresh but left my face and neck scarred up and my hair line crooked... you could tell the fade way off on both sides too then charged me 35</review>

All of the barbers here have skills! David is my son's barber  and he ALWAYS has him looking right. Super clean and crisp line ups, tapers, and fades! Hard to find a someone that can cut black hair in North County so definitely a gem!< /Review>

<rate>4<//rate><Text>Always good haircuts.  Anyone there can cut.  Clean place.   Parking is sometimes difficult, so park at the markets parking lot and you're good every time.

Also if you don't like rap music that is R rated be care. It's not always on but it was today and it was awkward because there were kids there.

I mean cuss words are words, no biggie...but songs that praise illegal gang and drug activity should not be promoted as a cool thing in culture, especially not to children.<//Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<review>I agree with most of the reviews! Yeah its a long wait but definitely worth the wait! Cynthia is my my go to girl now! Every time i go i ask for the same hair cut medium skin fade with a three or four on top! I've gotten my hair cut done by every other barber there and it never comes out the way i want it but this girl nailed it! Definitely going to make all my appointments with her from now on! Good Job!< /review>< Pictures>

<review>Good haircuts, a bit expensive and they take way too long cutting hair.
I waited a long time to get into a chair. Also, their times of business do not match when you look them up on line. It says open till 7 PM but they were turn in ng people away just a little after 5 on a Saturday.</review>< UserId.>

<Text>Good hair cuts if you make it to the actual chair. That's about it. It seems like you need to know someone there to get a hair cut without any of their buddies cutting in front of you. It seems like the employees are there to socialize than anything else.  Terrible customer experience.</Text>< pics>

Worst experience ever. They messed  up on my Son's and my Hair the same day. So irritated that the lady even over charged for my son haircut $15 , I felt like we were getting used for practice. I'm the kind person that Never complains, it takes a lot from me to write a bad review or even comment. My personal recommendation is that you stay profesional and if you're not ready for professional haircuts then don't use your customers as ginny pigs.
I've been going to this place for a very long time. Regularly I get great haircuts here, this time has me worried if I can trust and or recommend my favorite barbershop.<//text>

<Text>The quality of work ethic was very poor. I waited for 2 hours & did not get a haircut because it got so late. I came in at 7:10pm & they close at 9pm. I left at 9:15 w/out getting a haircut. The guys were f@©€ing around w/their buddies & their phones & taking 1hour & a half to do a 30-40 minute haircut at a slow pace. I've been there a dozen times before & never seen such poor work. And I've been getting haircuts every 3-4 weeks for the last 15 years @ black barber shop which observe cp time bit the haircuts are worth it. Sometimes what seems to good to be true........</Text>< pictures>

The place is a dump, the staff was not the best and the enviroment is not kid friendly. I saw the staff drinking a beers and allowing people to smoke in there. The person who cut my also messed up. I gave her pictures of what i would like, i later asked if she wanted to see the pictures to cut it right but she refused. They play favorites to past customers and allow them to go in front of ever. Overall my experience was very poor. I definately DO NOT reccomend this place.</Review>

<Review>Hands down Lusca is the man. The prices are right and the work is top notch quality. I first brought my son to get his haircut and after seeing the results, I had to hook myself up too. Recently I finished my second haircut here (faux hawk) and even got a beard/stache trim as well. Couldn't be more pleased with the results. They've opened up another spot a few months ago that is bigger than the original spot. Lusca pumps the jams and gets to work on your hair and you walk out feeling fly.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Review>My boyfriend hasn't gotten his hair cut since he was in elementary/middle school and had his mom buzz cutting his hair from then on. I walked in here and didn't even recognize him. I was fawning over him for at least 6+ hours. I felt like I personally needed to give the barber a handshake and tip him more than the cut even cost. If you're going to take your man here, make sure you stock up on condoms first smh he's really gonna come out looking like an all star.</Review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) They do not even deserve a star
It took 2 hours making a cut to my husband
He had to tell the hairdresser to stop him from being so horrible that they were leaving him and apart they dare to charge full court 🤬 lousy service I do not recommend it at all they are not the same people as before.
The plebes is much better service and a good price pity was closed when we decided to go to this place the worst experience.

Ellos ni siquiera merecen una estrella
Tardaron 2 hrs haciendo un corte a mi esposo
Tuvo que decirle al peluquero le pararan de tan horrible que lo estaban dejando y aparte se atreven a cobrar corte completo 🤬 pésimo servicio no lo recomiendo para nada no son los mismos personas de antes.
Los plebes es mucho mejor buen servicio  y un buen precio lástima estaba cerrado cuando decidimos ir a este lugar la peor experiencia.</review>

<text>(Translated by Google) This place has a lousy service, you have to wait about an hour and a half for someone to attend to you, nobody greets you, no one tells you how many people are waiting the hairdressers are talking about wasting time instead of hurrying, they think we are doing them a favor in coming to Your mediocre hairdresser will never come here again !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<review>I would rate it 10 stars because it is absolute perfection. Everything was phenomenal. The energy, the customer service, the music, the atmosphere, and the Sugar! It was indeed a perfect restaurant save the limited menu.

I can't really fault them for the menu. They did their best despite having limited items. My wife told the server that it was my birthday but I was diabetic, she still found a way to bring me a dessert that I could eat a little bit of!

I know I'm into minority so someone else will probably give him five stars. My only knock was that I don't like the way they made the hot wings. I know my taste are particular and not in a majority. I do promise everything else was perfect. It's a perfect place to take your friends, family, people visiting for out of town, business meetings, anything, anybody that just wants to have fun.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

We enjoyed ourselves, the staff is very kind and energetic. Great Vibe and food was pretty good but. not amazing! I will say this, the drinks were delicious and amazing big enough to share for the price if you wanted. The dessert looked yummy and worthy of a picture post for social media.My only complaint is the waiting to order. get our food and check .I understand. maybe under staff but it's Saturday at 1pm so maybe hire more for weekends.<//review>

Got checked in quickly and sat quickly at our seats. Waited a bit for water and our server but once she came everything went great. She got our order completely right and the drinks were really good! Little skimpy on the ranch sides and they drowned the salad in too much dressing. Like way too much, it became soup more then a salad. Other then that it was a great experience. $300 lunch and lots of pictures to remember!<//review>

<Review>Don't get me wrong the view and backdrop of the flowers are beautiful but food isn't all that great. I got the spaghetti with marinara sauce & meatballs and I personally think the pasta was better at Denny's. For those who likes their drinks strong then the goblet is the one for you! The drink is good enough for 2-3 people.</Review>< pictures>

Sugar factory was a hype.. It reminded me of a more "urban" "hip" cheesecake factory with less food options.. Its a cool experience for adults & kids but mainly for the youth.. The drinks didn't taste as good as they look. My nieces loved it tho so if you got kids, its a go! 🤝🏁<//Text>

<Text>I am leaving a 5 star review because the service I received for my son 16th birthday was EVERYTHING! Garret is such a stand up guy. He went above and beyond with his excellent service! He is definitely an asset to this franchise! And no, he did not ask me to write this.... I am just giving credit when credit it due!!! I love this place!<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>After waiting 20 minutes, I had to tell the manager who was walking by that we needed a server. The chicken and waffles were horrible. 4 pieces of huge over breaded chicken thighs sitting on top of flat waffles that I could barely see on the plate. My friend's plate had crusty spaghetti sauce on the edge of the plate (they ordered hamburger and fries) Our water tasted sweet like syrup (disgusting) and the straw sitting inside of the vanilla shake had crusty looking green stuff on it.< /Text>< user_id>

The Candy shop for sure, music playing, turn up spot, waiters and waitress dancing. If you like to turn up this is the spot. Bring your $$$. Good food with a twist on it. Reservation required. Celebrity spot. Behave!! Covid regulated!< /Review>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>I've been to this location twice in the past 2 months. The first time, there was no indoor dining and the second time (today) was limited indoor seating.

RAVES: really friendly and accommodating staff (one of the times we were there one of our guests wanted to move to a different table and they did it, no problem, despite being busy; and today a server was just going around setting up the umbrellas for all outdoor tables), easy check in (we had reservations both times ; we waited a little both times to be seated but they text you when your table is ready so you can walk around if you want), yummy milk shakes and drinks, good food, and fun atmosphere.

RANTS:. While I watch them do a great job of wiping down tables before seating them...the outdoor area needed a little love.  The seat covers were dirty, the floor and carpets were very dirty/sticky, and the tables have little slots that were full of food and dirt than fell in and was either stuck or not cleaned out.

Knowing a lot of places are short staffed, the "rants" area may be situational.  One thing I'd recommend to Sugar Factory is investing in handhelds or iPad minis so servers can enter orders at the table. Because the drink menu is extensive, and some drinks can be labor intensive, it may help to have them entered at the table instead of servers having to write it down and go stand in line at a POS. Not to mention most parties are larger for celebrating. This can save time so servers can attend to other tables and customers may have shorter wait times.

I DO recommend this place though, especially for a special occasion, it's a great location!!!!  I'd recommend going either during the week or before 2pm on weekends and make a reservation 😁😁😁<//review>< Pics>

<rating>1<//rating><text>The service was so bad went for my son birthday had a reservation for 10:00 waited for 45 minutes to be seated. Then the hostess refused to bring a highchair because we have seven people and the table seats 6 if I bring it my manager will come talk to you guys about having too many at a table. My family is seated we wait 20 minutes for them to fine us waiter after I complained about sitting there do so long. Finally, get a waiter she not very happy to be at work I guess, forgets my drink order no extra plates or napkins. The food was so bad I will never go back it was the worst. Their booking system needs to be fixed I did my reservation online and when you try to book for 7 the site tells you to call so I called and the message on the phone says to book online.<//text><user>116968307931241205989< /user><Response>{'time': 1620009256685, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to review Sugar Factory!

<Review>Arrived for my 11:30am reservation and was seated within minutes.  I waited about 45 minutes for our waiter before I had to finally get up and hunny someone down to take our order.  Finally one of the ladies in a dress shirt came and took it for us.  Food was out 15 minutes later.  Waited 5 minutes after the food for utensils and another 20 minutes for our drinks.  Our table was cleared and cleaned and I had to flag someone down after 20 minutes of waiting for the check.😒<//Review>< pictures>

The Drinks and music were good, but that’s all the was good. Took had to watch parties of 20 and 30 being seated before we did after have a reservation for weeks. I had a party of 10 and a 10 month old that they counted apart of the party. Our waiter was nowhere to be found and when found extremely rude. Reservation was at 6:30 pm and didn’t get our plates until 9:48pm and the food was like the drinks, cold. Would never go here again or recommend. 1/2 ⭐️</Text>

Customer service is Horrible!
They make your server leave you to celebrate another gusts birthday as if your not important. I'm confused, I reserved my table just like them which makes me just as important!
They don't acknowledge you after you've been seated,  if you get lucky enough. If your not of celebrity status, or know someone there, forget it!
Don't waste your time. It's over hyped, and you'll leave disappointed. Did I mention the food isn't good?
Not trying to salt them, but if your gonna give someone bad service, altleast make sure you have great food!
I was starving!<//text>

Very nice place. Great atmosphere. The food is "meh", Kevin is a cool waiter. Ordered two drinks and never got them. Manager came and offered us complimentary drinks for the wait, still never got them. Milkshakes are cool, but I've had better. A little on the expensive side not to get awesome service. My kids weren't too pumped and neither was wifey. "Nice, but no seconds.."</Review>

My bestfriend & I came to Sugar Factory in LA tonight as part of our #BestieTrip and it was a great experience from beginning to end! The vibe & ambiance was great, very upbeat, fun, & lively. They are quite busy so it may take a little longer to be seated but it is well worth the wait because the food & drinks are delicious! We had the sampler platter, the Signature burger meal, & a cotton candy cosmopolitan drink - it all tasted amazing! Well worth the price. Our waitress Tiffany, who was also the manager, was very sweet, accommodating, efficient, & friendly. Would definitely recommend coming here!<//text>

<review>Excellent restaurant for a party for any age group.  The food is delicious (the grilled salmon was exceptional) and their creative drinks are quite impressive!  While the waitstaff is extremely nice, they need to improve their response time with requests.  Hence the 4-star rating.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>After reading some bad reviews I decided to give Sugar Factory a try because my bonus granddaughter wanted to celebrate her 9th birthday there, she has been to the one in San Diego, and wanted to try this location. We arrived for reservation about 5-10 minutes early( 2/28/21 @8pm), and was greeted, by a very pleasant hostess. We were sat within 5 minutes, and the staff even took some pictures for us while we waited. The hostess walked us to a great table  near firepit, which I loved. We were promptly met by our awesome server Jennifer, who asked if we have been before, and took our drink order and made some great suggestions. We were given water right away, and Jennifer shortly returned with my wine. We already knew what we wanted and gave her our order. No joke, we received our food within 5-10 minutes, I was shocked how fast the food came out, my granddaughter ordered Rainbow sliders, and I ordered Chinese chicken salad, and then we got the Tye Dye Milkshake, everything was delicious, and Jennifer came back to check on us several times, she was very attentive. We had a great time, and I honestly had low expectations because of the bad reviews , so I figured we would go for photo op, eat some bad food, and my granddaughter would be happy, well I had a wonderful time from the beginning to the end. Great food, Great Service, and the music will keep you chair dancing. I am planning on bringing my son here for his 18th birthday, and I cannot wait! Looking for an excuse to come back before then:)Thank you Sugar Factory for  giving me and my granddaughter a wonderful experience last night!</Text>< Pics>

The PRICE WAS RIDICULOUS AND UNECESSARY but my server Shawn was so great.  He was attentive and made sure we were comfortable. Leah gave major attitude when she brought my shot in a dirty glass and I asked if I can get it in a clean glass. Antonio and Tom was very kind when we grab them over to our table to ask for something while Shawn was on break.
Now the overall service was a bit annoying because I has to wait 1 hour and 5 minutes to be seated and my reservation was for 4pm .
There was no compensation for the long wait and no apology. They need to work on that IMMEDIATELY< /review>

There's a reason why Drake, Mariah Carey, Jenn Lopez and a host of other celebs dine here!  Great fun for kids and for adults!!! The place is da bomb!!! The staff - particularly the dynamic, charming, AWESOME so 'real' MARCUS -  is so cordial, so personable, so likable and so authentic! You can tell when you're meeting the real persona and when you're meeting the "gimme a good tip' persona. Marcus is authentically cool! The other team members were also sweet, patient, and professional as well as eager to please, helpful, and knowledgeable. These guys are definitely invested in customer service and quality service to the point that they make you wonder whether they own stock in the Company! Lol Maybe they do.

Sugar Factory's food staples don't disappoint in taste, but it's more about well-crafted, artistic presentation and colorfully stunning 3-D culinary art when it comes to amazing fare that turns heads and makes you feel the uniqueness of eating here!!! The ambiance is special, and the music so ideally compatible with the upbeat positivity and charisma of this dining experience. We kept wanting to order every eye-catching dish and drink that passed our table on a server's platter. The waffles we ordered (kid size order) were good. The eggs were fresh. I am always criticizing eggs served at many establishments I visit on the basis that the dish tastes stale, bland, mass-produced. I really liked the well-prepared eggs served at SF though. The cheeseburger was delectable as was the side salad with arugula onions cucumbers and other very fresh veggies. The drinks...amazing! Order the Diamond Rose! The visual alone wowed me! The elaborate yellow rose wall at reception makes an excellent background for pics btw and many selfie-taking patrons (families, couples, singles alike) take full photo opp advantage of the pretty decor!!! Love this place - Drake, Mariah and I!<//review>< rate>

<review>We went yesterday for my grandson's birthday. The one in Century city. So overrated! Not clean at all the booths were wet as if they had just been wiped down, but the buttons on the booths had sticky stuff and old cookie crumbs inbeded in them.Food was cold. The 40$ drinks suppose to have 9 shots of liquor in them tasted like a wine cooler. Flooring was sticky  very unclean and with Covid you would think that they cared about being clean.We watched them get ready to sing happy birthday to a table and while they were getting ready the server's were passing around the 100$ ice cream bowl back and  forth to each other  for about 7 minutes before taking it to the table. How unsanitary was that. Bottom line is we all got sick and will never ever return.  It's a shame to spend 658$ for nothing. Very disappointing< /review></record>

We really enjoyed our visit on 3/16, the second day of indoor dining at restaurants after the COVID shutdown.  We were a party of 11 with a reservation, here for a birthday.  We probably should have checked in right when we arrived 20 minutes early, but we wandered around and checked in just a few minutes before our reservation, so we waited about 15 minutes to be seated.
The good: two tables, inside, close together.  Very friendly server, Marques made sure we had cameras ready when he poured the smoking drinks.  Good food, especially chicken fettuccine alfredo and club sandwich.  Clean bathrooms.  Great atmosphere.  Loved the chandelier inside and the plants outside.  The music was not so loud that we couldn't talk over it.
The bad: took a while to get our food, but we had plenty to talk about, so no biggie.
More good: although we didn't complain about the time, the manager, Percy came over and thanked us for our patience and comped part of our bill.  And the drinks were fun and creative.  It's like a grown up Farrell's with better food and atmosphere.  But where once was enough with Farrell's, I will definitely come here again.< /Review>

This was my first time ever at a Sugar Factory and it was a terrible experience! The staff here was the most unsatisfactory and completely incompetent I’ve ever experienced at an establishment.
I hate to be so harsh, but it was! It was so bad that everyone on our entire side of this location was complaining!
Here’s an example... one of the outdoor umbrellas fell on top of guests and it was picked back up but never secured and it fell another two times, before a guest next to us picked it up and held it for 10 mins. He finally grabbed someone and said this isn’t my job to hold this, I’m a guest! You let this fall of these people three times and haven’t cared once!
The food we ordered we never got served all of it and at the end when we were done and asked for a check we waited an hour and a half! They were so backed up that there were about 6 others ahead of us who had been there before us still waiting!
To top it off there was someone celebrating a birthday and all the staff was singing happy birthday and servicing one family but NO ONE else on my entire side of the place, we were all heated! I would steer clear of this place, if you value time! This place lacks customer service, such as the hostess who seemed to never want to help ANYONE, but constantly walked around looking cute for everyone and that was it! Terrible place I’m afraid. Save yourself. Don’t come here.<//Text>

Didn’t have our table ready when we arrived even though I made a reservation a month in advance. Had to ask three different servers for an umbrella for the table. Napkins and utensils were very dirty looked like they were never cleaned. As for the environment... the people there that day were very loud with zero manners. A table across from mine a child got up on the table to twerk. Music was loud couldn’t hear myself think. Food was ok not worth the price I wouldn’t come back and I don’t recommend. Don’t eat here don’t waste your time or your money the hostesses are very rude too.</text>

<text>This place was the worst!!! First off, when we got there their policy is not to seat half of the party. We had a small baby but they wouldn't allow at least one person to stand inside with the baby.
When they finally did sit us. They told us that at twelve of us could sit together, but they sat us six at a time and not in close proximity. Where we were seated, the seating was filthy. The hostess who sat us told me that the seating was really clean the stains just wouldn't come out.
This was my first time at this place but I will not be back. Not only was the service faulty from the jump....I bought candy from the candy store and some of it was fresh, some of it not so much!! I won't be back.< /text>< rate>

<Review>Terrible service!!
I made a reservation a month in advance and it still wasn’t ready when I arrived. The waitress and hostess were very rude. They ran out of drinks, so the alcohol menu is very limited. One of my guest ordered the rainbow mini burgers and they did not provide the rubber ducky, they said they ran out. The heat lamps in our section did not work, so we were freezing most of the time. They messed up on a lot of our order and was giving people things that they did not ask for. Then they told me I would have to pay or buy a dessert for them to sing happy birthday. This location sucks!< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<review>WORST EXPERIENCE IN HISTORY. THE WAITRESS ERICA IS TERRIBLE. ANTONIO WASN'T ANY HELP AFTER HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO HELP. JOE, THE MANAGER, WAS ALSO TERRIBLE. RESERVATIONS WERE AT 630PM, WE DIDN'T GET SEATED UNTIL 8PM. WE DIDN'T GET THE WHOLE TABLES ORDER TOGETHER. WE WERE MISSING SOME FOOD. DIDN'T GET ANY OF OUR BEVERAGES. I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT EVER AGAIN IN MY LIFE. AND ANYONE WHO MENTIONS THIS RESTAURANT I WILL LET THEM KNOW NOT TO GO.

Service was so slow, we had to leave. After waiting for 45 minutes for our food, we thought it would best to just go somewhere else. This food is not cheap. Can't say if it's good because we didn't try anything. We did get plates and silverware that was dirty. 😑< /review>

<text>This was 1st time going here and I was very unhappy with my experience. 1st I made an indoor reservation and got sitter outside in 90 degree weather, the young lady that sitted us ask if I wanted a umbrella I said yes. She disappeared 😕 spoke with a supervisor and got the umbrella. They waiter was very nice once I got 1 placed our order and really didn't take that long for my food but my son food took a long time then when he got his food it was wrong they took it back to fix it and it took another 20-45 minutes to bring him a new one and when they did it was a long brown hair in my sons burger, smfh at this point I was over this experience. Oh did I mention that I didn't get any silverware to eat my food with 🤦🏾‍♀️. I really wanted to go to this place and my hopes were high. I was even thinking about giving my son his birthday dinner there.

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Was super fun. We came here for a birthday on a Monday @7pm.. it was not super packed we got to sit inside & it Is open. They play really good music you can sing along to from the 90s+ . Our server was Thomas and he was awesome & sexy may I add. The drinks were cool I got a Henry moon & needed a extra shot (more sugar than spirits). They have more drinks than food items I think but it's a very good variety...something for everyone.. I got the breakfast burger it was super good but big I had to take it apart to enjoy it ( not a good choice for a date, could get messy. loved the fries! The birthday song & ice cream was a vibe 3 servers came out & did the tic toc dance 💃🏾 🕺🏿. They ice cream was huge it was 6 if us and we did not finish it. They put like 10 different flavors so if you are allergic pls let your server know. Over all.. it was great for 6 ppl with 6 drinks 4 shots it was about $550 & the gratuity was not included so we gave about 25% tip. Will come again.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>I must say this was the worst experience I have had dinning here. We had a party of five reservation for 8:30 pm we didn't get seated until about 9.15pm. So we finally get a table and the table wasn't clean it had sticky juice or some type of drink spilled on it so we waited again (another 10mins) to have someone clean it. We sat down and seen drink cups on the floor that wasn't never cleaned up we didn't had a waiter I just stopped one of the waiters that worked there and placed an order. The couch that we sat on had a lot of stains and dirt .This is not the type of place you would think of is in this area .For the price that they charge it should be more upscale and it's COVID IT SHOULD BE CLEAN and the food is getting worst..Wont be returning<//review><gmapID>0x80c2bb8c8c000001:0xa792c16503a23529</gmapID><Response>None</Response><date>1617916347573< /date><username>Cheryl Black</username>< user_id>

<Time>1599406007804</Time><Rating>2< /Rating><Review>I went there for the first time for my birthday. They have stains all over the seats and table cloths. I thought that was so strange as I've never seen a restaurant has stains everywhere. Second the staff is just like out of it, bored, tired, slow, apathetic. I don't know. It's just a really weird vibe from the wait staff. You expect in a restaurant this expensive to hire experienced, positive people who are hard-working. It was just a very weird experience. Ok then we go to order and half of their menu they say "oh we don't have that right now." It got to the point where we started saying, "OK WHAT DO YOU HAVE?" lol. Again, weird. Never experienced that at a restaurant before. They might be out of 1 or 2 items but half the menu?! Third, the food was very okay. I didn't taste anything that I thought was wow. The arugula on the avacado toast is very overdressed btw. Little touches they missed-- like didn't like the candle on my birthday cake. Ummm why not? Missed one of the little toppings that comes with the rainbow pancakes. Forgot dry ice in the drink... Honestly, it was a very very disappointing experience. I only gave two stars because the idea of the restaurant is cool and I really want to like it lol. It wasn't horrible, like inedible or anything, just not at all what I'd expect for a restaurant of that caliber.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Loved the food and drinks❣️
Hated the service and long wait. It seems to be short staffed here- we couldn’t even get our drinks early or together (waited 40 min for one drink)
The general manager was great and helpful- still the wait for basic service is way too long 😣</review>

Had reservations at 9pm and still had to wait an hour to get in.  We asked for well done burgers and they weren't fully cooked. But the atmosphere on the patio was romantic.<//Review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>The menu is a little pricey for what is essentially a kids' dream restaurant, BUT the service is deserving of high remarks. Our server interacted well with our kids and went as far as to show them some of the dances he learned from Tik Tok, which our kids loved.

This was my and our son's first time eating here (my wife and daughter had a lunch date a few weeks prior), and the food was pretty good. I had an Asian-inspired chicken salad (I apologize, I don't remember the name of it) that was not quite as large as the bigger Cheesecake factory salads, but was still a good size and left me feeling full after finishing the entire thing. The kids enjoyed sharing the multi-colored sliders and one of the specialty drinks (sans alcohol), and of course the various assorted candies adorning the huge glass it was served in. My wife had the chicken and waffles, which were also good (not Thumbs Up Diner in Atlanta good, but still pretty good for SoCal).

All in all, if you're looking for a fun family or even date night experience, you could do much worse than The Sugar Factory. The views from the outdoor deck add a nice touch as well. Oh, and the birthday celebrations that the staff puts on are pretty entertaining.

Give this place a try, especially if you have young ones; they'll love it.<//Text>< pics>

Had to wait 15 mins even after making a reservation.....get a table n they obviously didn't clean the booth (hello covid) n sat in someones alcoholic beverage they spilled previously resulting in the whole backside of my dress being ruined. Didn't see waitress till like 10 mins after being seated and she had to clean the booth herself cuz she couldn't find a busboy. So the rest of the dinner I had to sit on my wet dress that reeked of alcohol.</review>

<text>The sugar factory was nice.  The food and drinks were good but just have options because they may be out of what you want.  The wait wasn't long and our servers was great. Although we had multiples, that was fine we got our food 10-15 minutes later. It was my daughter's birthday and she enjoyed the atmosphere so that's all that mattered. I will dine again.< /text><Rate>4<//Rate><gmapID>0x80c2bb8c8c000001:0xa792c16503a23529</gmapID><user_id>114115093348312825912<//user_id><response>None<//response><Date>1598497700682< /Date><pictures>None<//pictures>< user_name>

Love the experience here. This is a must-see if you're within the LA area by Century City Mall. The customer service is great and the Ambiance is perfect. I love chatting with Maha and Kasey. Both were very inviting and warm spirits. This is the kind of customer service I'm talking about.</Text>

<rate>1<//rate><text>I don’t know where to begin with this establishment. From the check-in to the customer service it was a disaster. I had reservations at 330pm. I was advised when I arrived there was no need to wait in line, simply walk to the front desk to check-in. Upon arrival, there’s a line of people who hadn’t been helped and majority had reservations. I was informed to wait in line since previous guests were waiting. No problem right, things like this happens, they’ll get everything under control. Wrong, I wasn’t seated until 4:15pm.

It’s covid and of course every thing is outdoors. It was a very windy day, there was only one heat lamp outside, while i seen 4 inside the restaurant.The server didn’t arrive to the table until another 30mins and this was just to bring water, by the way. She greets us, we advise her we’re here for my friends bday, we order drinks and tried to get over the mishaps of what happened earlier. When we received our drinks (again took forever), my friends drink had to be sent back bc it was in a dirty glass(dirty glass was caught by the waitress, shouldn’t she have noticed the glass prior bringing it to the table) and was watered down. By this time, we’re over it. We ordered food and when the food arrived guess what? On dirty dishes. The fries were cold and the food unseasoned. We then just asked for our food to go and for the check.

The waitress brings our check, literally just hands me the receipt lol. When she returns, i see her and other coworkers with a dessert. I’m like, oh at least they’re going to acknowledge my friends bday. That’s cool. Nope, she drops the receipt to me and they walk by to sing happy birthday to next table.

The food is overpriced and nasty. How could anyone mess up on a Turkey club sandwich. The customer service is horrible. I’d never return to this place and wouldn’t recommend anyone to visit!<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Reservation at 2:30. Finally was supposed to be seated after 45 min of supposedly waiting on a seat not in the sun. We got seats in the sun. So unprofessional and not enjoyable at all. Never even got served. Sad situation!!!</review>

The food was good and the waiter service was good. BUT.. the bathrooms were filthy! The toilet paper was all over the floor, there was no paper towels and there was used face masks around the sink. The outdoor dining area had food on the floor and the dining booth was dirty.< /text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>The day before Valentine's day I decided to make a reservation for the Sugar Factory in Century City. My girl has been dying to go so I was trying to surprise her with a pre v-day dinner. My reservation was for 8:30 and we showed up on time dressed up and ready to have fun. When we checked in I reminded them to sit us next to a heater because my girl is anaemic. The lady responded with an attitude saying we will try our best. I brushed it off and said thank you. She then said they will seat us in 2 mins so we waited patiently while they seated others behind us in line. 15 mins roll by I ask so when will we be seated? she responded in a few mins I said thank you. We patiently waited some more. They then seated 8 other couples behind us. Another 10 mins roll by I ask are we still in the que they then acted like I just didn't ask them a while ago. I waited 10 more mins and they seated others. So I told them cancel my reservation. They said yeah sorry. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone well atleast this location. My girlfriend was horribly disappointed and mad.<//text>< Pictures>

I just left Sugar Factory LA. I had the worst service by far. I was brought the wrong food. My waiter then told me it would be another 35 to 45mins to remake my food. My lady was already finished with her food so I jusy decided to leave. I was there for a full hour and 45mins. I was so excited to go there. It was my first and last experience. They need more proper training.<//Review>

The 1st time I came had reservations got seated right away! The 2nd time I came made reservations for 12pm and waited! What is the point of making reservations if you won't he seated and the reservation time????< /Text>

Had no server come to welcome nor offer at least water and I was not willing to wait any longer they close at 10:30. If you cannot handle all the reservations then don’t let people book. It’s disappointing and unpleasant to have been treated like we don’t matter unless we have a birthday celebration. Don’t bother coming here unless you want to wait for 1hr or more to get noticed.</text><gmapID>0x80c2bb8c8c000001:0xa792c16503a23529</gmapID><date>1604989542870<//date>< userid>

Everything here was amazing! Waiters were on time with greetings and serving. The manager made sure that we were taken care of at all times. We came back twice in one day, so that alone should say a lot! Thanks to Jared for all of the wonderful service and hospitality! Louisville loves it here! #RSPCT<//Review>

<time>1603686355120</time><rate>3< /rate><Text>I loved the place however service is very slow. My server had a section with a party size of 20 plus people. We hardly seen her however she was polite. My second round of drinks took 45 mins to be brought out which was frustrating along with another 45 for our check . My food was delicious and so was my drink however my first choices I was told were not in stock. My next pet peeve was the umbrellas falling over multiple time. My particular umbrella had no sand bags or weights and spilled my drink which was never replaced due to my server never coming around. For $39 bucks thats very expensive to have spilled on my table due to my umbrella falling on it . I was not able to speak to a manager because no one came to check on us or offer help until after our meals and drinks were finished. I was livid and just wanted to leave. The tables cleanliness was also questionable and  the bathrooms were just plane nasty. No seat covers or toilet paper made me feel disgusted. I have a long list of complaints  from here that should be compensated but the lack of service got the best of my mood to where I wanted to just leave. Overall the actual place and concept is nice. Food was delicious but do not be in a rush service is slower than snail mail , and poor customer service.<//Text>< pics>

My husband treated me here for my 30th birthday and Jared the manager was absolutely amazing and so was the staff! It was so amazing we came back the same day to enjoy the night under the beautiful lights! This is now our favorite spot! Can’t wait to come back! Thanks again for for your amazing service, drinks and the food was absolutely delicious!!<//Review>

The food was spectacular, but the patio was so dirty. Our table was stained, the glasses were made of plastic so they looked dirty. There was glass under our table oh, and the floor didn't look like it had been cleaned in a while. I'm not comfortable going back there until it's cleaned. Also, service was horrible. We didn't get our drinks until our food came out, and our waitress seems like she wasn't trained well. Very unprofessional and made a lot of strange comments.</Review>

On top of all that, non-accomodating and blatant lying management capped off a once highly-anticipated birthday celebration for my child.<//Review>< Date>

First time visiting here and I must say the atmosphere is lovely..Now service on the other hand needs some work and more training in dealing with waiting tables.. We had reservations for 4:30 we were seated and didn’t get any service until 30 mins later after we had to ask for a waiter to serve us..The food is good and the the drinks are great<//text>

<Text>If it’s your Birthday you’ll be better off going to McDonald’s!!! They’ll service you better going through drive-thru them waiting 35-45 mins after your reservation time to be seated !! And that’s a big IF!!! I had a party of 9 and only 6 were seated !!! While the others waited for the table next to us get cleaned!! Which never did !!  Orders were WRONG and Food was cold ! Drinks came after the food and they wasn’t even the correct drinks !! It was the only drinks they had available that was brought out ! I’ve never had a restaurant give me a take It or leave it
Option before !!!! Then the table received more of the drink then in the actual cup !!! She kept spilling it while trying to pour it in the cup !! Literally had to ask for utensils after the food was brought out !!!! Spoke to 2 different managers which still did nothing to give us a better Sugar Factory experience !!! I definitely should of stuck to going to BARTON G!!!< /Text>< gmap_id>

<text>Terrible experience today! Party of 4
Food arrived prior to drinks we informed waitress which admitted to error in ordering from Bar
45 minutes later still no drinks. I asked to speak to manager not only waited another 20min she approached our table with attitude said You asked for a Manager? Never introduced herself or apologized for error seemed bothered to speak to us. After another 20-25 minutes she brought the drinks to our table didn’t speak just set them down and acted like we were a burden.
When we were finally able to get a waitress attention to ask for the bill we had to wait another 20 minutes and no one returned I had to walk in and try to find someone to help process our payment.
At this point there are other 3-4 tables of people complaining about not getting their food or bill.
Poor Management........
Poor customer service
First and last time we will ever attend this place.
Ruined our first outside dining since quarantine 😡
If you don’t change your management you will continue to lose customers.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1598303154891, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to review Sugar Factory!

I visited to celebrate my birthday. After my friend went above and beyond to get the reservation we arrived about 15 mins before it was time. Still had to wait an additional 20 mins but it was fine being that that gave us time to shop at the store and take pictures. As we were waiting all of the staff were very friendly and polite. I can not lie this place IS a whole vibe. We were seated and that's when the real issues came, it was like the server did not want to serve us (a small party of TWO!) easy money you would think. All of the other servers were interacting with their customers,  and checking on them. He came to the table 3 times, to take the order, to bring the check, and to bring the cards back! I was so mad because this was supposed to be a fun experience FOR MY BIRTHDAY!! I told him that when the other guy brought out the food 20 mins prior I asked for mustard, when he brought the cards back do you think he brought some or ask if I still needed it which was a given because I had only touched 1 of my 5 sliders. NO! I feel like had we had a different server things would have been so different. The food and drinks were really good though. Just make sure you have an awesome server and everything will be cool.</text>

My first Experience was terrible, I made reservations for my best friends birthday who came out of state to celebrate. When finally being sat we ordered cocktail drinks which took an hour and 15 minutes to arrive. 30 minutes after ordering our drinks we decided to order our food. To follow up the food came out before our drinks, and when it came out it was lukewarm and not to expectations. Then our drinks arrived after a long period of time.My overall satisfaction was a Negative. But the server and manager on duty was nice. But I will not recommend or dine in again.<//Review>

I visited this place, it was only outdoor seating, but still nice. I've been the Sugar Factory in Orlando and had a really good time. We didn't get the full experience because of Covid. Next time I'm in town I will definitely return on a Friday or Saturday night. Only complaint is that the service wasn't as good,  a little slow. I assume due to Covid, they may be only requiring minimal staff?</review>

Might as well use all this free time to do something productive while waiting for a server, such as like warn others to avoid this restaurant. If you're just coming for a dessert, it may be worthwhile. For food though, it took 25 minutes to get a water, 1 hour to get food, and still waiting (15 minutes+) for a box and the check.

As others mentioned, the food was mediocre. My burger was overcooked, but didn't matter too much since the novelty items they put on it overpowered the taste of the meat anyway. What won't have me come back is the terrible service. For instance, I had to ask two different people over a 15 minute period just for a spoon. Definitely not worth the high price.<//Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Horrible customer service this host was rude I had made reservations for my birthday which was on September 25 for 3;00 pm we were not seated until 4:15. I had another guest coming and she swore she couldn’t have me wait for my guest , so she still seated us in a horrible area sun is burning us up . We never got a menu , no one never came to ask us if we wanted something to drink , or anything no waiter ever came, now it’s 5:05 I literally had to go inside and ask why no one ever attended to us . That finally came and took our order , by that time I was already fed up and ready to go I didn’t even eat all my food had asked them for a too go box , which they forgot to bring , instead they bring me out my cake wish me a happy birthday with a dance that was nice , however they threw my food away . I didn’t want to ruin my day by cussing them out and demanding they give me another plate I just left . I’m big on customer service and your workers lack that , ok . Horrible experience I’ve ever in life had .< /Text>< pics>

Worst experience. We came to celebrate my mother’s bday. And waited on our table 45min no one approached us. Went up to the serve 3 times to ask for someone to come by and nothing. Finally got fed up and left as we are walking out the server had the audacity to say oh well bye. Instead of apologizing for the inconvenience and for ruining my mother’s evening. Not acceptable< /review>

I visited Sugarfactory yesterday night and the service was terrible, the employees were rude, they were understaffed, and it was pretty bad. If it werent for the manger on Duty Lamar, I probably wouldve left and said forget it but he did his best to insure we left somewhat happy. The food is great and so are the drinks, its just hard to get your order in a timely matter which makes people upset. It takes 30 minutes to get a glass of water, another 30 minutes to get your drink, its bad. Our reservation was at 10pm, we didnt get our food until around 1130pm. I am not recomending this place to any of my friends or family memebers.</Text></record></dataset><record>

HORRIBLE!!! Waited an hour outside our reservation! Certain Staff members were rude and VERY unprofessional. Very overpriced for the service! Wouldn’t recommend it was a waste of time. Sticky floors, broken chairs, staff NOT wearing a mask, dirty chair cushions, and chairs WITHOUT cushions. The hostess said “she only works on the weekends and she doesn’t like her job.” Allowing other customers to play their personal music. However, Steven was a very professional and nice waiter.<//Text>

Flew in from Dallas, Texas to visit this place. What a WASTE‼️ Seemed nobody knew what was going on. Had reservations for 9, got seated close to 9:30, after the hostess seated other people who showed up after us (with no reservation)  it took us nearly 20 minutes after being seated for a waitress to even come to our table, to get our drink order.
Service at this place was the WORST!! Especially for the prices. I regret visiting this location and wish I would have chosen a better establishment for my wife’s birthday celebration.<//review>

<user_name>ajamz mom<//user_name><text>Loved it, the food was so good. We had the sampler that came with buffalo wings, chicken fingers,onion rings, mac and cheese pop. I has the Steak flatbread pizza. So good, steak, mushrooms and more on a crisp flatbread. We were celebrating a birthday, they have a DJ play a song of your choice. They come and sing at your table, we got the half size dessert feed 6. It's filled with ice cream, candies, gummys, caramelized bananas, and a lot more. We had a blast, our server Ryan was awsome. You can browse their store while you wait for your table on thier patio. The store has ice cream, candy, gummies, lots of cool merchandise. We plan to go again for the next person celebrating a birthday.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Rating>5</Rating><gmap_id>0x80c2bb8c8c000001:0xa792c16503a23529<//gmap_id><response>None<//response><user_id>115506417486724586512<//user_id>< date>

I ordered the Macaroni burger it came Luke warm. The music was so loud that we couldn't here each other. The food was just OK. The milk shake was good. Our waiter was decent. For what they charge for a hambuger they really need to work on it. The chicken sandwich looked like it came from a lunch cafe restaurant and it was just ok.<//Text>

Never again😭they took so long to attend us, the seating area was dirty, & the food isn’t all that & expensive for no reason. If you do go i recommend to just get their $40 alcoholic beverage that was the only thing that was worth it.< /text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Horrible horrible horrible service. No point in making a reservation here. Had a reservation at 3:30, wasn't seated until 5. Had to keep asking how much longer for my party of TWO. They kept telling me only a few more minutes then they disappeared. While waiting there to be seated I could see that this is a very common problem they have. A lot of people waiting there with us that had a reservation earlier in the day.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c2bb8c8c000001:0xa792c16503a23529</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Slowwww service. We had reservations at 6pm, didn't get drink orders until 6:20pm (we only ordered water) and didn't our food until an hour later. Plus an additional 15+ minutes to get to-go boxes and the check. I also ordered a non-alcoholic "Virginia Strawberry Lemonade" that never came. The food was mediocre. I ordered soup and it came without a spoon. We had to ask 2 different people for a spoon only to be forgotten or ignored.

If you go for their desserts and alcohol, it might be worth while but only because it's "Instagrammable." Otherwise, it's not worth the high price.

Also, I wish they're stricter on their face mask requirements. There was a big party near us that kept walking all over the patio without masks.< /text>

This was my very first time eating at this restaurant. We waited for over an hour. When our food finally arrived we did not get our appetizers we ordered. They did not provide any silverware with our meal. The drinks were watery and our waitress did not provide napkins. We had to wait for 30 min to get anyone’s attention to inform them to bring silverware. First impressions are everything and this was not a pleasant experience. The waitress’s dress was so short and not professional attire because when she bent over you could see her derrière. Also the cups the water was brought in were dirty. The manager on duty NEVER came to our table to address our issues. She said she would come over but never came back<//text>

Our reservation was for 9:30pm and we were seated at 10:15pm. There were open tables and no one else waiting so I’m not sure what took so long. After being seated our host didn’t arrive to our table until 20 mins later. The waiter Shawn was not friendly and I’m guessing since it was the end of the day maybe he was tired, IDK. We ordered our drinks and food to avoid additional wait times. The food and drinks arrived at a decent time but we had no silverware or straws. When asked for silverware the hosts stated that they were on their way. My niece got up and grabbed her own silverware and walked to the bar for straws. The food was delicious but because the service was sooooo horrible I would never go back to this location. Must I also add that we drive 25 mins to see what the hype was about. Never again!!!!!!!!!< /text>

Food: The chicken alfredo is tasty and it was a  big portion. Experience: cute for photos and candy but they’re not doing a good job with service. They move really slow, aren’t proactively cleaning as well as they could, and oblivious to the lack of social distancing. This restaurant has all the bells and whistles but at its core it’s a subpar experience.</review>

<Review>Process Peak provides a high level of service to its customers. Communication is key in business, and they have been consistent, prompt, and pertinent in their interactions thus far. Olin was knowledgeable and walked us through each step patiently. Each of the team members we have dealt with has been willing to communicate at our convenience and in a manner most agreeable to us. They are optimizing our social presence online, and have been willing to take on the headaches of multiple erroneous social presences.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

We worked with Olin over the phone on our initial contact and had a very positive experience.  He had researched and prepared information for us.  When we explained some of the unique problems we face with our online presence, he listened carefully and offered good advice. We had a pleasant, no pressure conversation.  We're looking forward to developing a good working relationship.<//Review>

I just finished an initial call with Aaron Waldberg from Process Peak. He was very knowledgeable, informative and helpful. The service Process Peak provides is exactly what our company needs to help manage our online presence and reputation. I am especially excited about the Reputation Builder service. I signed up immediately and am looking forward to working with them. Aaron followed up quickly with an email outlining the next steps. So far I am very impressed with Process Peak.<//review>

We didn't need a "package deal" as was proposed, because we do most of our social media in house and we do well with that. However, he was able to come up with a plan that will fit our needs. Now, I hope to see a jump in our business in the New Year since signing on with them. Stay tuned for the results....</Text>< Pictures>

I have been working with Christian Urbach and the setup process has gone smoothly. We are just getting started but are seeing some traction with some of our social media outlets already. This is such an important part of our business and it's nice to have someone that can lead in the right direction!< /text>

Olin Tichy and his coworkers did an exceptional job explaining how they can help my online presence. The time they took to dig into my company, learn about my business, and describe how I can make a better online presence was intriguing. They spent this much time learning about me without even a forefront commitment. I am looking forward to work with these guys and see how much they can help my business grow. From the beginning stages, I can certainly attest, that they have their ducks in a row. Thanks for the help Olin and Crew!!< /review>

<Review>Olin Tichy did a great job of explaining things that are generally out of my comfort zone. I've implemented a few of his suggestions and have definitely seen an increase in my online traffic. The changes that he suggested were easy to make and have already had an impact on my business. Thanks Olin!

Olin Tichy was a great resource of information while he guided me through the process of working with his products. He was patient also because I didn't decide right away. He gave me the chance to work through my own questions and concerns without pressuring the sale.

I would recommend Olin and Process Peak to anymore looking to increase their visibility and online presence.<//review>

Although we are new to this arena, Olin Tichy has really worked hard to make us feel comfortable with Social Media.  We are confident that he will continue to have our back and will help to move us forward in the process.  He is quite personable and easy to talk to and has made this a very pleasant experience.</Text>

Over good experience.  The complaint I have is the follow up call that was discussed on the initial all was never confirmed so I was caught off guard when I answered the phone.  No fault of Olin's, it was the person I spoke with on the first call for information and Google + creation.

Olin did a great job going over the process and what Process Peak can do for customers.< /Text>

Aaron Waldberg did a fabulous job explaining how Process Peak can help us maximize our social media profile while minimizing the resources required to keep up with the process.  Then Christian Urbach took over and helped us quickly get up and running.  We have been impressed with the speed, thoroughness and professionalism of Process Peak and we look forward to the value this partnership will deliver.

Olin Tichy did a great job with showing and explaining how he is going to grow our social media footprint for Budget Blinds of Highlands Ranch and Centennial Colorado.  We are looking forward to working with him and expect great things!  Thanks so much Olin!

Olin is definitely a plus for Process Peak.  He was very patient, clear, and detailed when explaining the service and followed through with every promise!!!.  I have only been with Process Peak a short time but Budget Blinds of Douglasville is  already coming up in the top 5 of organic searches.<//Text>

I just got myself connected to the google plus program thru process peak and my contacts, Olin Tichy and Christian Ubach , have been remarkable to work with.  They have made the transition extremely easy and it was simple to follow their directions.  I am thrilled to be working with Process Peak to boost our business on social media.  They exude very positive and professional demeanors as well as great sense of humors which make it fun!<//text>

<review>We just cancelled our service with Process Peak after being with them for four months and not showing up on google searches.   We were paying a lot of money for SEO but haven't noticed a difference since signing up for them.  Lots of promises but no monitoring and no results.  As it turns out, our google+ page wasn't even verified and we weren't showing up on any of the searches unless we googled our business word for word.

I can't recommend these guys.  They didn't deliver what they promised.  They get you to write an amazing review right after you sign up with them (which is very clever way to get lots of positive reviews) but they don't actually make the difference they promised.  How many reviews are from people who have tested and loved the service?  I'd have to look hard to find any...

12/1/2015
I spoke with Olin, from Process Peak, today and we had a long conversation about what we could have done differently to see the results we were hoping for through their service.  I realize that I had a few misunderstandings and misconceptions that skewed my expectations.  By communicating with them earlier, those misunderstandings may have been resolved and lead to better SEO.

It's no small thing for a small business to pay the price equal to a small car payment each month for SEO.  Process Peak has hundreds of clients, but it would be really great for them to have some sort of monitoring system in place so that some of us small, inexperienced business owners don't get looked over in spite of ourselves.  That's why we pay the experts.  For the price, I do expect a certain amount of attention and results. The impression I had when signing up for Process Peak was that after a few months, because we understood results take time, our business would be found on google search for the areas we service.  We weren't showing up like we expected, which may have been helped if we were monitoring our own business on google.

Since cancelling with Process Peak, I have been learning about and working our SEO myself. Though, I have started to see some of the positive results I was hoping for, it has taken a whole lot of time and effort to learn and implement all of it.  With that said, I can see some value in business owners being able to call Process Peak up and have them do the SEO for them so they can focus on other business details.

If I have any advice for new businesses getting started with Process Peak it would be to keep in communication with them.  They give you a great initial consultation but it's a flood of information that may be difficult for new comers to retain.  With Process Peaks vast clientele, It will be up to you, as the business owner, to periodically monitor your situation and contact Process Peak for advise and with any questions you have about optimizing your experience and SEO.  I wish I would have contacted them and asked questions when I took over the marketing for our business a month ago.  Who knows, maybe we would have seen better results.

Olin and I also spoke about possibly implementing an automatic email system. This way they could give advise to their vast customer base on ways to succeed and properly use the services offered by Process Peak.  It would provide information for inexperienced business owners, such as myself, to stay informed and learn on more of a drip system then from the end of a fire hose.  It's not a fix all but for those who read their emails it would help.

With all this said, I changed my review from one star to three because I believe that Process Peak is putting effort toward customer satisfaction.  In spite of my earlier negative experience, I can see those efforts.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1447369680399, 'text': 'Hello Hillary,\n\nWe would like to apologize for not performing to your expectations.

We have recently hired Process Peak to assist with our marketing endeavors thru the internet.   Olin Tichy was extremely helpful in explaining the process and how we can better drive people to our site.  I have been trying to handle this myself for over a year and realized I need to run my business and let people like Olin and Process Peak work behind the scenes to help generate new leads and potential clients.

<text>Worst customer service. Had a lady trying to do a return of 12 receipts. Took 2 of them to wait on this customer.
Only one register open. I asked is this the line and was told "it's going to take a while".  Meanwhile the line was growing. Where was I suppose to go. Luckily a tall young clerk asked the other clerks if there wad someone to open.  She came back ready to open and wait on us. My question is it takes 2 clerks to wait on one person and ignore 5 of us standing in line.  Bad customer service.</text>< pics>

It is 8:52pm and they rushing everyone out the door. If the time on door says 9pm thats when you close. Someone needs to contact corporate. This isn't the first time they've done this. I've come in at 8:45pm before and they wouldn't let me shop. Its crazy.</review>

Just your standard Dollar Tree, the neighborhood is safe at day but not so much at night but so is all of Stockton, so be careful.

Selection here is limited as this is smaller than most 99cent stores for example, however, they've recently added refrigerator with some chilled or frozen products which is good.

Overall, I would say the Dollar Tree offer bargains on some products, but for some other products you're better off finishing your shopping in the near by Walmart in the same lot, so be mindful of the prices in both if you are shopping here to save up.
Drinking water is one thing for example that is cheaper in Walmart, and most canned goods as well.

The staff here is friendly and helpful, which is always a good thing and rather better than Walmart I would say in that regard.< /text>

< Review>
My girlfriend always wants to come here as the first stop when we’re in Bakersfield. Good energy solutions and friendly service with a smile. All of the baristas are very nice though I feel bad that they may be cold in winter months. I admire their tenacity and dedication, truly they are the bravest and strongest of food service workers. The coffee drinks are sweet and strong, they will give you the energy kick you need. I personally enjoy the energy drink blends, which are similar to those offered by Dutch Bro’s, but better in my opinion.</Review>

Service here is awesome and the eye candy is a delicious treat to go along with my black coffee. Americano is my drink but they make cool drinks that are really good. They do coffee-free, decaf and coffee drinks like frozen blended, iced coffees and lattes.</Text>

<Text>The service is good and the ladies are nice but the real reason we come here is for the coffee, and it is good. I like strong coffee and for that I give 4 stars, you can taste the coffee behind all the sugar and additions but it isn't the focal point of the cup. The balance is good, not too sweet not too bitter but it lacks that 5 star punch in my opinion. Overall the drinks are definitely worth the price and the fact none of the workers there were snobby to us unlike other places where the baristas think they are God's gift to us.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Very tasty coffee. i enjoy them not just for the eye candy but because they actually have good coffee that you can drink right away. i hate Starbucks because i feel like i have to wait 20 minutes for it to cool before i can enjoy it. That said. try the bombshell with white beans. YUMM!!!< /review>

Anyone who says they enjoy this coffee is doing so because 1: they don't know what good coffee taste like and 2: because they went to look at the girls. The coffee is terrible. I took one sip and poured it out.</Text>

I haven't actually been here. I hear the coffee is pretty decent and it's a drive through joint. I think that the scantily clad female barista thing is kinda sad and weird, but if that's your thing, you might want to give the place a try.<//review>

< Review>
My first time coming here this morning and I hated it. Got there 6:15AM and 30 mins later, I'm still there waiting for them to take my oder. I decided to leave because I was going to be late for work. Bunch of stuck up girls.</Review>

Delicious and very authentic Pakistani food. We tried Lamb Brain Masala, chicken seekh Kabab, beef seekh Kabab, naan bread and loved every bit of it. Traditional Spicy food with generous portions and reasonable prices! Highly recommend it<//text>

My first experience was just after coming from India, so couldn't resist to compare with what I had back in India. Shouldn't compare but there are some improvements can be there to make it one of the landmark in this area. Surely there should be other fruits then just apple everywhere. :)<//review>< UserId.>

<text>The tandoori items are absolutely among the best in the Bay area. The Steven's Creek branch is a bigger place to accommodate lot more people. The Kabobs though are great, I feel they are slightly over priced, but nothing away from the Bay area pricing. And oh, the masala tea which is complimentary is absolutely fantastic.</text>< response>

However, they are very very very slow. I have been to this place three times now, each time I ordered just one biryani to go, and they took almost 30 mins for that.

If you have plenty of time, definitely a place to visit.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x808fb57e511c7efd:0x5d8676da51e71008<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Two stars are for the great Indian food. However, the chairs and tables are old and need to be changed. The decoration is horrible. seriously people, try to spend some money on the decoration and it will look like a palace. The ceiling needs to be changed, we were able to see the color is yellow, which mean there is an old leak. I will go again as soon as they start taking care about the customers more than the money.< /text>

You have to order food right at the counter. They wont tell you plates and silverware and water are self serve. You need to get them all yourself.  Plates/silverware tend to be dirty/poorly washed. Best to do a take-out. Mediocre waiters dressed up poorly in casuals.</text>< Pictures>

Run down place, roof was leaking at multiple places after light rain, mouldy smell, average food. The veg biriyani was spoilt when they served and they just said it was fresh when we asked. I am never going back there. The one star is for free tea that the serve.< /text>

Our go to dishes are Chicken Ttikka Masala, Kabas, Lamb curry, Naan, rice dishes and the Sweet Lassi. Any left-overs are always just as good, if not even better, when reheated. I think this is the best indian-pakistani restaurant in the Bay area. We have tried several.
Free and good hot Masala tea demonstrates the owner's hospitality.
The value and quality for money makes this one of the very best restaurants of any kind in the Bay area.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Text>This one is done. Wondering when it's about to close. 4 tables full on saturday night. Food was 3.5 stars. Place was leaking water from ceiling at 5 different places. Men's room was dripping with water, this place has so much deferred maintenance .

It used to be the best hole-in-the-wall place in south bay for a couple of years in early 2010. The quality just went down down down.

I think the cheap indian food segment is just dying and so is the expensive indian food segment. The flavors, the crowd pleasers are all long gone. It probably has to do with the cost of living, all the  best chefs have moved to cheaper cities .

Only time will tell of there is a resurgence of delicious indian food in the bay area. And when  it does I hope the crowds are there to make them feel welcome.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<Date>1519940921488< /Date><text>We went on a Tuesday night and placed an order to go ( an order of mutter paneer, an order of chicken tikka masala and 4 potato filled naans) . There was one other person in front of us in line, so the service was fast. We were in and out fairly quick (about 20 mins) but the food was not up to satisfaction, especially the chicken tikka masala.  It was mostly gravy with very few pieces of chicken in it but the worst part was it didn't taste like chicken tikka masala at all.  It was just an ok chicken curry. Perhaps it was end of the night and they were trying to get rid of whatever they had left. The potato naans and mutter paneer was good but the chicken tikka masala (or lack thereof) left a sour taste in my mouth. I will not be returning.<//text>< gmap_id>

<Review>I used to like this place when it was at its old location. This new place has more room but the food quality and especially service have degraded significantly. The lamb chop was almost burnt and was pathetically small. It seems they had removed most of the meat from the bones to make other lamb dishes. The cashier person doesn't acknowledge you when you're in front of him to place your order. When we went to pay he stayed on the phone and just blurt out the figure. We weren't even sure if he was talking to us. We won't be going back.< /Review>< pics>

The food is great. Their murg tandoori is one of the best I've had in the US. I love the chicken tikka masala. The palak saag is delicious, has the right amount of sour taste.Price isn't too bad. Well worth it.<//text>

Food was flavorful. Will not rate it the best. Aloo naan is too heavy but tastes good. Could be crispier. Curries were good. Had okra masala and paneer masala. Paneer was too hard.< /Text>

<review>The food is amazing, absolutely great food. Our family all, 12 of us have been going to this restaurant for many birthday celebrations.  The naan goes great with the Chicken Tikka Masala and Basmati rice. There is a plethora of varied dishes from all over India and Pakistan. If you love Indian food this is the place to go.</review><name>Kamal Lakisic</name>< Rating>

<username>Albert Ong II<//username><date>1491443730623</date><rating>5< /rating><Text>Savory Indian food on the spicy side, I went with the cheapest entree on the menu, the chicken briyani at 9 dollars. I was blown away by how similar it is to the chicken briyani I grew up with in singapore. Super effective bowl of yogurt included to help with the spiciness if you are not used to the spiciness (yogurt is a staple of Indian/Pakistani food I think). Complimentary masala tea (sugar added if you want it sweet) polished off this authentic taste of traditional Indian/Pakistani cuisine. My heart melted a little at how traditional it tasted, the many spices used in the briyani exploded with a contrast of clove flavors. Will be back to visit again soon.</Text>< pics>

Disgusting! Sickening! Tasteless! These guys should stop calling themselves a restaurant and change to creating rat poison! The food is really bad! I took one bite of the naan and paneer and threw it all away. The naan had a thick layer of garlic, enough to keep most vampires at bay. The paneer, well let’s just say it seemed like someone just puked in the dish. Would never order again from them again. Really disgusting! Food can be considered weapons of mass destruction! Yuck! :-(</review>

don't order paneer tikka tandoor. They just give you few pieces of overburnt paneer in a horrible way. Disappointed with Shan. They can do much better. Please replace the yellow onions with red onions, its terrible to eat yellow onions raw. The veggie biriyani was good. Naan was ok.<//text>

My açaí peanut butter bowl didn’t come with any açaí, and because she made four bowls at one time and only added one scoop of peanut butter it was a waste of money. Just the girl working on Sunday May 30 at 5 pm, had the worst attitude treated customers terrible.</Text>

<Text>Food is amazing. Getting the order right??? NOT so much. Very annoying when you're very excited to get your bowl or whatever and its wrong. No matter if you order via phone, app, door dash or what have you, it always turns out wrong. Then there's the app... there are so many things wrong with that, I don't know where to start. I wished someone would start a new smoothie/ bowl / buz. The owners have taken a backseat to so much,  its a bummer.<//Text><userid>113158187207234299352< /userid><Time>1609452983050< /Time>< resp>

I thought the employees were extremely rude when they asked me to leave because I wasn't wearing a face mask even after I explained to them that my doctor recommended that I not wear one due to my health challenge and disability. I've been going to nekter juice for years sometimes daily, but you've lost my business, I will never go to the store again!< /Review>

<review>Love this place! Love the menu! But the service is way to slow. Used the app to place my order estimated time was 30 minutes, and that was fine. I got there and still had to wait another 15 minutes for my order! Then realized my order was made wrong, and the ginger shots had nothing but ginger. No lemon or cayenne just a cup of juiced ginger!</review>< pics>

< Review>
I went in today and no one was wearing masks. I politely asked both girls working if they could put on a masks seeing as how we're in a global pandemic that's killed 180k. She told me that I was crazy and that the masks has holes on the side and that it doesn't do anything. I was shocked and saddened seeing as how my mom has RA and is at high risk. I then called the owner and the owner told me that "everyone has their own opinions" I will never ever go back to any Nekter after that. I was amazed at how a place like that could treat someone especially during a global pandemic<//Review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Make sure to download their app to maximize your rewards. Greens are a challenge to incorporate into any diet. This really helps fix that need to get fresh veggies in. Avoid the pea protein, agave, and anything too sweet, just my .02 for a healthier drink. Maximize the micro nutrients with as many greens as you can handle!! I don’t believe in the detox concept, but I do believe in getting as many vegetables into your body as often as possible!< /text>< Pics>

Chunky smoothies. Mostly frozen fruits for their berries and bananas, not exactly fresh. Unles you consider “fresh-frozen” fresh. Snacks available are full of cane sugar, canola oil, milk powder etc... Staff is pretty indifferent towards customers. Atmosphere is pretty unappealing, cold, loud, grey. They choose to use agave syrup instead of dates to sweeten the smoothies. Could be a much healthier place, prettier, a lot of potential. If you’re here to get a healthy drink apple, beat, spinach, ginger, those tend to be fresh.<//text>

< Review>
It's no surprise that everything at Nekter is incredible, hence why I LOVE going there! But while every other Nekter I've been to gets my order ready in less than 5-10 minutes, the Dana Point location doesn't quite match up in terms of efficiency. I have been to this Nekter probably 5 times, and EVERY SINGLE TIME I have been there, there are very few customers and I still find myself waiting a minimum of 20-30 minutes for my order. At this location, the counter/work area is very open, and it legitimately doesn't even seem like they try to get your order to you quickly. Instead, a couple of my friends and I watched two workers make drinks/ bowls for people who had seemingly been there several minutes before we walked in incredibly leisurely and slowly with ZERO regard for time. I have always gone there with the hope that maybe I got caught on slow days previously and the service they provide will actually be done efficiently, but I have never been so thoroughly disappointed by an establishment that I have had to compose a negative review about it. If you don't mind the wait time because you're simply relaxing and hanging out with friends, then I'm sure this is not a bother whatsoever. But for people who expect a certain quality of service, especially if they have somewhere to go, for your own good, do not come to this location. For the benefit of its customers, I truly hope this location improves its services in the future.< /Review>

The layout is strange. You have to enter by what feels like the backside of the plaza.  The staff was nice and very detailed in preparation.</Text>

I like the juice but there is no way to call store location without going through an 800 number for corporate and corporate is not open the same hours .  Total inconvenient for customers.  Put location phone numbers for Christ Sake!</Review>

I love the ice ! They have different flavors every day and they are always delish! The custard is so rich and creamy!! 😊 I try to come here at least once a week because it's just so good!< /Review>

< Review>
Delicious Frozen Custard! I'd go as far as saying it's the best Frozen Custard in Visalia!

Wonderful location and the options are plentiful when it comes to flavors to choose from.

If you're a Vegan you can choose from shaved ice and other desert options.

Highly recommend.<//Review>

<resp>None< /resp><Text>So I finally visited today. Employees seemed like they would rather be at home. 🙄😒 I was looking at the ice cream decided to try the unicorn milkshake. Got me a large. It came out like a slushy and they made me pay extra for the whip cream. Pretty bummed about having to pay extra to make my drink look halfway what it’s supposed to. Only thing I like here is the ice cream!</Text></record>

<review>Well, I do like Italian Ice, and was excited to get some after driving 5 miles off the freeway to get some.
Thought we’d be ok given that they reported to Google that they close at 9:00 PM.
Arrive to find that not only was their scheduled close time 8:00PM(sticker on the door; they were locked up, closed, and all gone when we arrived at 6:47PM!!
I’m guessing the root of this is inconsistent management or Rita’s is a struggling business models for franchisees.
This is the second time I’ve been willing to try Rita’s and haven’t been able to because a location was closed way outside what they post. So for now, I’m 0 and 2. Someday I’ll find a location where the franchisee is open when they say.......someday.<//review>< Gmap_id>

The girl had the worst attitude and ignored me when I was talking to her. She didn’t even put whip cream and a cherry on top of my milkshake. And when she was handing our items to us she kinda just tossed them to us. If she’s working there my next visit I will sure be walking out and taking my money somewhere else. Didn’t see a name tag on her other wise her name would be posted on the post.</review></record></dataset><record>

This is my favourite place for something cold to eat. Their italian ice is the perfect smooth texture. Strawberry Colada is the best flavour. The only downside is that they switch up their flavours every day. If you want something specific, you might have to wait for it to come around again. You can sign up for their daily email to get the list of that day's italian ice and custard flavours. They also have a rewards programme on their app. If you scan the QR code, you will get one free after 8 visits.< /review>

<Text>Staff was not very helpful. They had no coffee. I had to order hot chocolate. I wasn't pleased with the flavor. (Apparently, you can mess up hot chocolate). I also ordered a custard. They vary in flavors. Of course the ones I wanted they did not have. When I asked for a sample the employee rolled her eyes. So I will not go back.</Text>< pics>

They need more registers, an im lactose intolerent badly so i asked for a small cup of tap water to take a dairy pill an the young teenage idiot (supervisor) told me no. Id have to go to the rest room an they have a small sink an to be honest i didnt fell like dipping my head in a lil sink to take a pill. She advised me that store policy pre vents them giving a cup over the counter. All i needed was a small cup to take a pill.  An we spent $30 . Im sure a box of cups they get for not even 30cents. Ill never go back to that spot.Ive gone to Cold Stone,Baskin Robins,TCBY an they all give u a cup with a ounce of water

<review>I love Panda, the food is great. Never had a bad experience on the food. However since the start of covid, I only go thru the drive thru. Never fails, I NEVER receive ANY of the proper sauces for my meal. If someone orders the teriyaki chicken, should the sauce automatically be included in the bag as well?? Why should I have to ask...< /review>< Pics>

If I go through the drive-thru and grab lunch it’s fine, however both times I’ve ordered dinner for the family using online pickup, the food has been bad, had slow service, and am missing food.

The first online order I placed, I had to wait an additional 30 minutes at the restaurant waiting for one item to be finished. Food was okay but was cold and old.

Just got home with my latest order (3 plates and a couple sides of spring rolls) and the spring rolls were on bottom, smashed, and were very old. The fried rice on one plate tasted fine but the other tasted very old and the rice seemed hard and stale and the same thing with the chow mein. We ordered 3 plates and only received one fork, no soy sauce, and no fortune cookies.

The girl who gave me my order was visibly irritated that I interrupted her and asked for my order.<//Text>

They do not allow 2 orders for one car. I asked them to put $20 then put the rest on my card instead she put 18¢ and charged the rest on my card without even telling me.<//review>

The food was okay but the staff was rude, they didn’t give enough forks, the sodas had no flavor, not enough cookies for the order and the kids meal was missing the cookie(my child’s favorite item).<//text>

parks. Particular location stops cooking early and only offers what's left thus limiting your selection in the evening. Compared to other Pandas this place seems excessively greasy. Parking is ample but located in a ruff area so lock your doors.< /Text>

<review>We usually like going to Panda Express this particular trip the food was not up to expectations something was missing in the flavor we ate it it was okay it was not as it has been in the past we'll give it some time and we'll go back and try it again can't put my finger on what it was missing but it was missing. Food was good just not like it was in the past. Staff was extremely helpful and friendly as always.< /review><user_id>107044288870216248173< /user_id>< pictures>

Last friday 8/9/19 i got beef broccoli that didn't look right and when i tasted it it tasted like orange chicken sauce or something to mask the flavor and i got food poisoning for 3 days. Anyone else?</Review>

< review>
Very good! I arrived at 6 pm Saturday night and the place was almost full. The friendly staff handled my order quickly.The iced tea dispenser was full and fresh. When I sat down to eat, I found the food fresh and not having sat on the warning tray a long time. However I would have preferred the Orange Chicken to not be as hard crunchy as it was. Maybe it was over cooked BUT it wasn't mushy, which would have been worse. I've been there several times when I am in the area working and it's consistently good. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Panda as one of the better ones to visit.<//review>

The wait was rather long and the customers were being shoved through an assembly line. The staff didn't seem to be extremely friendly. I asked for extra things and it was a struggle to get what I wanted. Tables were dirty and the place didn't look all that clean. I took it to-go. Haven't been back since.<//review>

Very unprofessional. Rude employees. 30 mins. before closing, (before 10pm on Friday when closing time is 10:30) I was told at the drive through that they had run out of all food.
If your employees can't do their jobs then you don't need my business. This wasn't the first time I was treated rudely for no reason at your establishment.< /text>

Incredible service and way cheaper than any other pest control out there. I wish I had found them sooner!! Webs were completely gone, and for how many I had this is quite incredible! After the granulation in my yard, I didn't find any more bugs out there so I could go relax with my family on my property. No better way to take care of my home and keep it nice!</review>

Nice sales people. I had a very pleasant purchase experience and they really made u feel at ease. They people who came to spray were gone in less than 5 minutes and left my side gate open. I have a dog! He’s not a runner and I’m lucky enough I caught it, but he will wander out in pure curiosity. Other people may not be so lucky as I.  I was very upset at the negligence. The people spraying told me they would speak to me once they were done and all they did was leave a door hanger on my front door I found when I stepped out to ask them a question and they were already gone.< /Review>

This was only my first time using Brooks' service but I don't think I'll have any complaints in the near future. The technician (Trevor) answered every question I had before he started, and was friendly, polite, and respectful of my property. As long as their product works the way they say it does (as I said, this was our first appointment) ill upgrade this review to a 5 star.<//text>

As a new client I only had the outside treatment done at my request, next treatment will be ready for everywhere to be treated.  The gentleman who I signed up with was very nice, caring and very informative. I felt comfortable with signing up for service.  The technician that came out was also just as nice,  polite and did his job completely.  I look forward to not seeing any creepy crawlers.<//text>

I was prepared to drop this service because of several sub par jobs done for the last few months. However the young man who did the spraying cob web cleaning did a very good job this time. I have requested that he continues doing my property. If not I will probably drop Brooks. I have only had a few of these responsible individuals from Brooks and the last one left so Brooks figure out how to keep good people or it's over</review>

<Review>We were told that there is no contract and no charge  when we cancel out the subscription at any time of our own will, we signed something we were not informed about, we were told we are signing the info papers on whats included in the service NOT a contract. They are now charging me $250 for a cancelation fee.
I would not recommend there services.<//Review>< Pictures>

Mike O. came out today and gave me a lot of good info about how to care and maintain my home. He was very informative and professional.  He was on time and early when he arrived and got right to work.   Couldn’t have asked for more. Definitely gong to keep Brooks Pest Control on speed dial for future referrals to others as well. I am very happy I signed up for the year with Brooks Pest Control.
Thank you Mike</Text>

I appreciated the quick response and took him up on his offer. Martin came in and explained what he would do and when he would also come back to follow up.

We've utilized Brooks for some time now; and our experience with Martin this past Saturday was our best yet. He was very thorough with our exterior treatment and knowledgeable about the other services Brooks offers that we were unaware of. Martin was helpful and provided some great recommendations! We'd love to have him back again.< /review>

<Review>I signed up a year long contract with Brooks in June 2020 because I had a problem with ants and the large outdoor cockroaches. The problem was basically eliminated after the first visit from Brooks. They come out every other month to re-treat the perimeter of my house and sweep cobwebs. The representatives from Brooks are always professional and helpful. It's definitely worth the money and I would highly recommend this company.<//Review>< Date>

I’ve been with this company for over a year and I’m super satisfied with the service. Every winter I would be traumatized with aunts that would take over my home. Trailing in from outlets and every crack they could possibly get in from.
Bless Brooks we have had 2 winters clear of aunts spiders and no hornets during summer.
I don’t enjoy seeing dead bugs around the house or yard.
If you need an aunt free home brooks is the way to go.
And I love that no more cob webs around the house something we never get around to cleaning.< /text>

I wasn't able to get to the front door when the tech arrived. I heard him out front but could not see him. I waited for him to spray and remove the webs under the roof eves in the back yard. He never showed up in my backyard 😒.  He didn't knock on my front door when he left either. I'm really disappointed with this tech. It was also a very windy day and he should've known not to spray my property. I was auto charged for the service that day. I need to call Brooks to let them know about the bad service.</Review>

When we signed up, we specifically requested that the yard not be sprayed for bugs, as they are valuable to our garden. Every time of service we get a new person. We have only had the same person once for service. As with all new reps, they do not always read the notes (if any) for our residence and the service we requested. They would be in service mode of "same services to each residence." This is quite frustrating. I specifically ask them to get the spiders/ webs from the eaves. This is typically done half heartedly. From the frustrations listed, we will now be canceling our service.< /text>

I was not happy with the service. Our service guy was really, really nice. Liked him, but not so sure about the spraying that he did. We were barely starting to leave the house (he had just walked in) to let him spray, and we were surprised to see him walking out with us. I was shocked. Also, when our sales guy knocked on my door, he talked about dewebbing. I showed our tech the webs on my ceiling, and, well, never took them down. I looked at our ring cameras inside and outside the house, and it doesn’t appear that he sprayed our house thoroughly. I might cancel, despite the cancellation fee, and hire the company my daughter hired or someone else. Heck, I might just continue to have my husband spray himself. We already have the stuff, and he was spraying our home. I just thought hiring a company might’ve been better, and, now, I’m not so sure. I still see all kinds of wasps, bees, and other bugs still. Mind you, our home was just “sprayed” on  Friday. Seems like a waste of money at this time. Not sure I want to continue with Brooks.< /Review>

Zachary did a great job!  The exterior of the home was thoroughly treated. He treated the borders, doors, windows, and along the entire fence line, and also dewebbed the eaves of the home and fence line.

Great job!<//text>

At first I was very excited about the service.  But after the first treatment I didn’t notice anything.  The technician showed up about an hour late and only stayed for about 10 minutes and the salesperson basically lied about everything.  He said that it was not a contract and that I could cancel whenever free of charge.  Highly disappointed in Brooks Pest Control, if you’re looking for good pest control there are plenty of better options out there!</text>

<Time>1616290029644</Time><Review>Last summer they sent sales to all the properties on the street. The salesman provided discounted first payment pest control service with one year contract. We were not very sure whether we should sign the one year contact. The salesman promised he can cancel it even though the contract is for a year. After the first service, we were not satisfied with the quality and called to cancel. All the salesman were high school kids doing summer intern and left Brooks already when we called. So brooks pest control denied our request to cancel. Thank you Brooks, you have trained your interns very well and taught us a lesson.<//Review>< GmapID>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Very satisfied with Brooks. I had trouble with ants in the house year after year, especially during the winter months, and had started to see a few cockroaches, too. I also had Black Widows appear around the base of my house during the summer months (eek!). Since I've been using Brooks, I have seen none of these pests. None. Zero. Brooks worked with me to setup regular services that fit my budget. They will work with you, too. Give them a shot. I think you'll be pleasantly pleased.< /Text>< date>

<text>The first pest company that has met expectations!  Most say “they’ll do this and that” and their technicians are done in under 10 minutes and I’d still have the same spider webs.  The technicians at Brooks actually use the duster the company provides for them and sweep everywhere. My fence line, my pergola, even my plants; it’s awesome!   👏🏼👏🏼    More than happy with the results Brooks pest control has provided!

Sincerely,

Satisfied Customer< /text></record>

The service was very good and it started killing bugs right away. The only thing that I had a problem with was, I started the service and scheduled the first service for the next day. I received a phone call the next day and they canceled my appointment and said they would call me to reschedule. I never received a phone call and a week later someone showed up to spray while I was at work with no notice. By luck my son was home and he let them in.< /Review>

<review>This was my first time doing pest control on my house. I followed the tech around the house while he worked. I noticed he only did the base boards of the house, but the only window sill he did was the one in our living room. I didn’t say anything because I shouldn’t have to tell them how to do their job. He also said he would de-web the garage but never did. Unfortunately I’m stuck with them for a year so hopefully next time they cover all perimeters.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<text>I was very happy with the service provided this time.  In the past it seems like the person checks in and is here for a short time and leaves, then I find cob webs all over areas of the fence.  Not this time, it was clear he took his time and did a very thorough job.  I saw him outside spraying and providing extra attention to his work.  I really appreciate Joshua and the great job he did for us.</text><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

Good service. Ron was great. Just make sure you don't miss a scheduled appointment because they won't spray and you'll still be charged. If you fail to call and reschedule they won't call you. However, they will send an email telling you they missed you and to call to reschedule. If you don't you'll still be charged for services not provided. TIP: don't miss an appointment. I learned the hard way.< /text>

Over a couple years, I have seen a few different techs, and dealt with office/scheduling personelle.

I’m SO HAPPY with them!

Having fairly warm weather year-round, has brought unexpected challenges regarding pests, not being from CA.
They educate, kindly!!!
They know the area so well.

No matter if service was just completed, a new challenge arrives, they RE-Service at no charge-immediately, since we’re on a package plan.
We have A LOT of stray cats in the neighbourhood, and live by a creek, so WILDLIFE.
Spiders! Ants! Mosquitos! Fleas!
Sand/mud wasps! All dealt with!

I give such high recommendations to this company and everyone I have encountered, after years of service. Thank you!!!!<//Text><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

<Text>We decided to use Brooks over the other Commercial brand for several reasons; small business and local resident/employees servicing our area. Brooks is competitive in price-points with service guarantees that stay static in the long-term, without an over-extended contract (2+years). The best reason we decided to keep using Brooks?
They do the job- period.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< username>

This company you can’t relay on. I hired them  they did such lousy job. Such as instead spray my house for spider they sprayed my neighbor. Good thing I had Ring Bell.
Thy put rodents traps.one of trap behind washer and dryer not put properly
It’s hang on dryer horse instead of floor. I called Brooks Control the Service Manager, Jose told me he will come out take care problems . But he never come out and never return call. I wouldn’t use this company,<//text>

Brooks do an ok job not the best. I always have to remind them of where the spiders webs like to come up at. And it’s almost as if it’s not really helping as much. I used a different company before and Brooks is just a bit better. But still need more improvement. It seems when they spray we start getting spiders inside out home. And when I don’t watch them they do not tend to go around the house unless I ask them too. And another funny thing I saw the guys using my water hose and he didn’t even ask for my permission. So I was wondering if that spray was only filled with water...anyway, a few more months with Brooks and we’re done.</text>

James came to do the quarterly service and made sure that no area was left untreated. His easy mannerisms and patience with all our questions was deeply appreciated. He left us feeling that we had definitely got our money's worth. This is the second visit since the initial visit and we have not seen any silver fish, ants, spiders or carpet beetles in the house since Brooks took over the problem. Thanks a ton Brooks!!</review>

Brooks Pest Control has taken care of my place for almost a year, and I love the results of their service. I had ants everywhere, and after the first treatment I've had none inside and out.  There are no more earwigs or slugs eating both potted plants and delicate garden plants. With the spiders and webs along the fence line gone it helps to clean up the backyard. I also like that even after a treatment if I see any bugs Brooks Pest will come out and treat without a fee.
I've only had a bug free, positive experience... what more could one ask for!< /Text><GmapID>0x808fe89d2381e3ff:0xe8a1af4e1112e48b<//GmapID><username>Jeanie Coniglio</username></record></dataset><record>

They said they can cancel my current contract with Terminix they preached they could do a better job I come to find out that they can't cancel another company's contract as that threw me quite some red flags with this company I'm not sure of how all the positive reviews but I would stay away from this company as in the Discovery Bay area most of the people that left Terminix are going back to them when  the contract is up if not canceling sooner  They may be good at service in  easier areas as I'm sure all pest control companies are but if you have problematic areas this mom and pop  place with their dishonesty just aint the one</text>

We started with problems with ants.  Now we have regular service.  We like that they notify us when they will be at our home as well as letting us know when they arrive.  It gives us time to bring pets inside.  If we have issues between services they will come back out.</text>

I been satisfied with the company so far.
On the last visit the guy didn't want to clean the spider web in the garage.  He told my son they don't do that. I was pretty upset then I called the office the girl who answered the phone apologized . So we put notes for next time to get the spider web. Hopefully they come thur.<//Review>

< review>
I had a service done on my house to eliminate spiders. The service technician was very friendly and willing to go into the crawl space of my house to spray their product. This was great, because I hate to go in this crawl space due to the spiders that are down there, but now I am able to go into this place no problem. Thank you Brooks!!< /review>

<Text>The service associates were at my house as scheduled and followed the requirements of the PPE as they performed services during this time of the pandemic. Service was performed as expected and on a couple of visits we requested a revisit to certain areas that needed treatment that had not been sufficiently addressed. An associate was dispatched shortly and resolved the issue to my satisfaction.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>The technicians are professional and friendly. They are respectful of your property and clearly explain what services were performed. Customer service is always prompt and professional when you have an issue and are quick to fix or change an issue. Outside our house, we were infested with spiders and fleas in the backyard. Using Brooks has solved the problem. We will continue to utilize their services!<//Text>< Pictures>

I've been using Brooks for a couple of years now and couldn't be happier with their service. They give ample warning of when they're coming out to do your service and reschedules are easy. I had a big problem with black widow spiders and cockroaches,  that they've completely eliminated. We're still working on the rats but but if I didn't have chickens they'd be eliminated by now too. Did you know rats will steal chicken eggs? Buggers aren't after just the chicken food. lol< /Text>

<Review>This morning the technician knocked my door and told me to do the service. I opened garage for him, then I went to brush my teeth. When I finish my my brush, he finished the spray all around my house, which shall be less than 5 mins. I viewed my secure camera and noticed he just quickly walk around the house.

I would not recommend Brooks to my worst enemy. The service is poor and they complete my large yard in 8 minutes. I timed him. He spent more time on his phone in front of the house. The mosquito service invites more mosquitoes to our yard. I tried to cancel the service, that I received at a “discount” and was told I would have to pay the full price, not the discounted agreement that I had signed up for.
DON’T USE THIS COMPANY.<//Review>

<text>I signed up the service by their sales person walked to my door. I did not really need that but would like to help the local business due to current difficult time. I lost my job recently and called them to cancel the service because I cannot afford it. They did not gave any kindness back and want charge $100 termination fee - the sales person told me I could stop at any time free but the termination fee is hidden in the long contract. I also overpaid $50 at the first service and they would not allow me to use as part of the termination. When I tried to discuss with them, they simply hang up my call.

Update: checked the old reviews and found quite a few people complained same thing as I did. DONT sign contract with them! I should have learnt this lesson before I hired them.</text>< user>

This last technician we had on Friday was the best out of them all. He was the most friendliness an he did more work than the others. He sprayed the the yard like it is supposed to be sprayed an got the webs down like there supposed to be even from the top eves of the roof. Product wise idk if as effective as other companies. I still have alot of beetles an flies that I stress on more so stress on flies an the mosquitoes. .<//Text>

< Review>
The way Brooks Pest Control work is text book fraud. They have Customer Sales person come at you saying neighbours have signed for something that they offer service for a discount. Initial Service costs 250$ and they give discount of 200$ (Very generous)  and you have  to sign up for the contact for an years service 600$. Somebody goes over a document with you to sign. They got great text notification informing of upcoming service and technician might not even let you know if  you are coming and will put a note outside your house saying it is done. So you as a customer do not know what you got for 99$ . Now if we cancel the Service we have pay 200$ for the initial service discount.. not so generous now. This is one worst not so straight forward business I have dealt with. 5$ value for 600$ they offer.</Review>

I would not recommend this company at all. There are a scam and get you in a contract without you even looking at. I should have know better any company that goes door to door for sales. !! I have more insects after they started then before. . I'm sure they water the spray down.!! Be aware of the cancelation fee in small print. I just did not have time to deal with these fools so I just paid it other wise their solution is to send you to collections.
Just bad people.<//Text>

This company is anything but professional. DO NOT SIGN A CONTRACT with them. They're pushy  salesman promises things the technicians do not do.  I fired Brooks Pest Control because they left me hanging with a bad wasp problem. The wasps were getting really bad crawling all mover the windows and scaring my family. I called and they said it would be five days because they were really busy. Mind you their salesman and their website boast about same day service. So then an hour before they were supposed to be there they called and said they needed to cancel because it was too smokey and the soonest they could come back out was 8 days later! What a joke! I took the day off and now I have to wait a total of 13 days to get a wasp problem addressed. So I took care of the wasp problem myself and fired Brooks Pest control. They say I owe them $250.00 for breaking the contract I told them they broke the contract by not providing the service that they promised in that contract. I Tried to get in touch with the owner or manager 4 different times nothing not a call back just collection notices via text and email. They also  used my address to gain access to the gated community to cold call my neighbors. Come on pull your head out and run a business with some kind of integrity. Provide a service. All you needed to do was say your sorry and we both would just move on.  I wish I had read the reviews of this company before I signed up.< /Review>

These guys are not local to my area. I had a salesman tell me otherwise. They charge me ridiculously high prizes and told me it was because they do a really good service. I’ve had companies in the past that do a way better job than these guys. Don’t wast your time or your money. Give your business to the local companies. Overall this company is just not good.<//Text>

They were coming out for about nine months and I continued to get bugs the entire time.  spiders, ants, beetles, I had cobwebs across my ceiling that would come down and land across my face and when I finally canceled they refused to stop coming and then they would just keep billing me I told them I don’t want their service yet they try to force me to keep it so I just stopped paying.  Now they’re saying that I have this big bill and they’re going to send me to collections and I am super unhappy with that<//Text>

This company is a misleading and manipulate you under false pretenses where they get you to sign a contact you never even see and tell you your signing something only authorizing them to deduct payments from your account.  Their spray did not work even after coming back a second time.  They tell you they will remove all cobwebs but it wasn’t done on either of the two houses even after coming back a second time.   I had to buy bug spray myself for both of the two houses they did for me.  I was lied to on charges amount and I don’t recommend ever doing business with them at all - for any reason.  Then just now as I am typing this Gage had the nerve to say I was lying to him.  Yes I have it in writing!  Really what Ñerve!  Bad business practice -customer service to call your customer a liar.  How dare you!  I’m furious!</review>

I signed up with brooks a about a year ago. They did not do a good service and I was not satisfied so I did what any person who was unhappy would do... I switched companies! This is America right! They said that they had cancelled my account and then one day I got a phone call saying that I owed them 200 dollars. I said “$200 for what!” Their employee said that I signed a contract (I never signed anything, I purchased the service over the phone and was not told there was a contract). After reading all the other reviews on here I’m not surprised. I wouldn’t recommend this company to my worst enemy. They lie. I can confidently say that this is the worst pest company in the area.< /review>

Eli was the man with the plan that set me up. We were seeing a lot of ants around our kitchen and since they’ve started servicing our home the ants have been gone. We did see a little extra activity after the first service but I think that’s normal. We’ve gotten 2 services done so far and it has been an excellent job. Would recommend.< /Review>

<user_name>L Z< /user_name><Time>1595967446046<//Time><rating>1</rating><text>I doubt some of good review are fake.

They came to my house and we signed a contract 3 times per year. Since it is pandemic and I do not want to touch the paper, and he said they would send the detailed contract to me by email, but the salesman never did.

The technician came several days later and performed the service, and said it was changed to 4 times per year. I asked them to change back to 3 times and email me the contract. They never did.

Then less than 1 month from the first service, they sent me a text message, and said they would come again. I called, and they said it was 5 time per year. I asked them to send me the contract, and it was shown 7 times per year, totally not the same as what sales man told me. How can a sale man convince a pest control service on a good house for 1000 dollar per year? They took the advantage of pandemic. The sale man keep telling me it is okay not touching the paper, since they will send me the contract by email. They said if I cancel, they will charge $225 for cancelling fees.

I read previous review, decided to cancel the service and report it to BBB. It seems like a trap for customers. I originally wanted to give people a chance to make money and do business during pandemic since this is such a difficult time, and they don't deserve it.

I will guarantee they will not receive cancellation fee, and I could use my own money to see them on the small claim court. If everyone just gives them what they wanted, the bad service will prevail in bay area.</text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>I didn’t have very high expectations because I was forced by an aggressive salesman to sign up, but the service is poor and I still have bugs even though they’ve serviced our home several times. Now I’m stuck in a contract but as soon as it ends I will never use this company again. I encourage you to do the same.< /Text><gmap_id>0x808fe89d2381e3ff:0xe8a1af4e1112e48b<//gmap_id><Name>Raymond Dixon<//Name><pics>None</pics><time>1599409022565<//time></record>

<Text>Their salesman bold faced lied stating two neighbors were using their service which it turns out is a lie as well as local - I am in Modesto so also a lie.  Lied about the price and the service. Told me $400 (reduced as promo offer to $300)
for annual service (quarterly visits) with additional if bugs worse. First one first of Aug and paid $100 bugs much worse so called, came 9:3 now want another $200 and said final visit would be in Dec - guess they have a 5 month annual?

Normally I wouldn’t rate a pest control service because if I’m not seeing bugs then they are doing their job. But brooks pest control has gone far beyond expectations for me. They listen to everyone one of my concerns as well as explain what they are doing in my home. Highly recommend.</Text>

<review>If you just had somebody come to your door and sign you up for a pest Control service I feel that you need to hear what is going to happen to you! This company lies and does not preform the service the way that they say they will! You still have 3 days to cancel your contract! Do it! They say they use plant base products but be sure to do your research because they really don’t! They said that they will spray everything when in reality they hardly spray at all!< /review><resp>None<//resp>< rate>

If you are doing the same thing I did and are looking at reviews after a salesmen came to your door look no further. If you are having a similar experience then you know that this sounds like a good deal. WRONG!!!! Not only did they make it sound like there was no contract of any kind but they definitely didn't tell me that I would have to pay $249 to cancel after they do a terrible service. bad company and bad service, 1 star rating only because google wouldn't let me go into the negatives!!< /review>

<Text>The technician wiped down all the eaves, including the second floor soffits, backyard pergolas and fence line.  The flowerbeds around the house were treated with a granular product and the entire house and garage sprayed at the perimeter and windowsills.  I don't want to jinx it, but we have not had any problems inside with pests and, if we did, they would come back out at no additional charge to remedy. Every technician has been on time and very professional.</Text>< pics>

<user_name>mx greg<//user_name><date>1590787760556<//date><rate>1<//rate><Review>They come to your house, ignore your no soliciting sign, sign you up for a 12-month contract without your knowledge.  They give you no information about your contract and a bunch of promises that are lies.  By the time I got the contract emailed to me they say I have to pay an additional $175 to cancel...  Actually I'm still not sure how much it will cost me.  Even the manager couldn't seem to tell me how much canceling would cost..  So something like $300 out of my pocket and the house and backyard is covered in spiderwebs and bugs 10 days after service.  I think if you ordered online and could see what you are getting you might be happy, but I haven't noticed a difference in bug level.  I would rather read what I'm getting than listen to lies from a salesperson.  Or maybe you might want to stay away from companies that can't seem to explain what they are charging you.  Share your experience.  Did you get a copy of the contract without contacting them several times?  Did they actually kill bugs?  Hope this helps someone out there avoid wasting $$$ and frustration.<//Review>< pics>

<text>I have a really bad ant and spider problem. Brooks Pest Control scheduled something within a couple days! They took the time to walk inside and out of the house to see all the areas that needed attention. Great customer service very accommodating to all my requests. Ant traps weren't with the gentleman who came out to the house. I called and they're spending some out tomorrow. Sheds needed spread upstairs bathrooms.. they saw that the ants were going across the grass so they put pellets down. They even broomed the overhang of my roof and front door area and I have never had a pest control company do inside and sheds! Only the outside . I definitely like supporting a local company. I highly recommend them!<//text>< pics>

Sales people must be trained to push people to their limits. Can not justify using a company that simply uses force to get customers.  1 Star. Learn some manners.<//Text>

I am typically very skeptical of sales people because I have been ripped off in the past. I felt the only way to get this guy to leave my doorstep was to purchase a service because frankly he was very unpleasant and said that the service was only a one time spray. He lied. I guess I’m in a contract now. On top of everything the service is absolutely terrible. Never again will I fall into the trap of brooks pest sales.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Fabian stopped by today to service our yard.  He was very friendly.  He explained what he was doing there and how long it would take.  He was very courteous when worked inside the house and put on shoe covers.  After the service he explained what he had found through his walk through.  He also cleaned out all of the cob webs from the fence and the house.  We were informed of the appointment ahead of time by text and email and he showed up right on time.  I would recommend this service and specially Fabian if you can request him.</review>

I strongly urge that you don’t use this business. They will not do a good job.
They string you along by doing very little work so that you allow them to return to your residence. Awful Company. You could get home defense from Home Depot and it would do a better job than these guys.< /Text>

Steer clear from this company. They are professional scammer. They would knock on your door unexpectedly and entice you with their 1Dollar pest control first time trial. Once you hand your credit card,  they will trick you and sign you up on a 12 month contract. Mind you, they are not cheap. Each month will cost 99 dollars (recurrent fee). They never explained subscription, me and my witness heard from the guy very loud and clear, “this is not a subscription. You can cancel anytime” Now they are asking me to pay 349 dollars to cut the subscription that was never disclosed during initial encounter. They cant even show proof that I signed a contract.  Be very careful! I wish their company suffer a big Karma for tricking innocent customers. Im working on reporting them to bussiness beaureu and file a lawsuit.< /Text>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>The sales person knocked on the door and pushed so hard to sell. So I signed the contact. But they never addressed my main pest issue. Every time the worker would just come and spray for the sake of completing the  task instead of truly treat the pest issues. I paid $250 to get out of the contract. BE CAREFUL when you sign the contract by the sales people who knock on your door from this company. They don't care about your pest issues. They only care about how to trap you and charge you.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x808fe89d2381e3ff:0xe8a1af4e1112e48b<//Gmap_id></record>

Brian and Drew stopped by to showcase Brooks Pest Control's services, and we signed up immediately. They certainly seemed to know what they were doing.

<Review>Started Sevice in June, We have had to call them back 4 times for ants, they must be spraying with water.  Now they are trying to charge me for a return spray for $115 when every time they have come back it was for the ants. Was never told that they were coming back for initialize spray.  I am not satisfied at all, and they say they have a guarantee.  Was told by the customer service gal that since I want to cancel they would be billing me for $115 plus a cancellation charge of $150.  I will never use or suggest this company to anyone. We are so dissatisfied that we chose to use this company.</Review></record>

Same as what others have said they are a scam so do not accept any door to door offer from them they will put u in a contract without even realizing it and  when u cancel u will  have to pay a cancellation fee. They will tell u they are servicing in your area and since they are there they want u to try their service with a discount from $250 to $99 then once u agree thats it ur under contract with them  on a bi monthly basis 😡<//text>

Pay a little more and use a more reputable company like Terminex<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x808fe89d2381e3ff:0xe8a1af4e1112e48b< /gmapID></record>

Hear them in office laughing at customer's request. She claims she's HR an sits their and makes fun of all the customers what kind of business are they running here. When customers aren't happy and hang up cause they weren't being helped. "They say charge them an extra fee you got their card on file", crazy part is the boss (Jacob) laughs and says "I'd do it". Worst company to hire for services or work for. Just a scam.< /text>

< review>
The young sales rep knocked my door during the COVID-19 while everyone is sheltering in place at home, I have never heard of this business so was being nice and gave it a try. Unfortunately, the young sales rep didn’t explain the plan clearly so there is a confusion afterwards - the promotion is $49 with a warranty, this is what he told me and I have never received a contract in email as promised. Now, they are charging me $99 bi monthly service, 7 times bi monthly service in the contract that I have never signed up for. The customer service is terrible. They are just collecting the fees. This business needs to be honest with their customers, otherwise they are just asking for bad reviews. Please avoid this business if you can.<//review>

What a joke! Horrible manger! The guy doesn’t care about his customers! I think his names Jacob or something, and on top of all of it, half of the good reviews on google are fake! Just saying! Sketchy company! Go with anybody but these guys!</Text>

< Review>
Chase from Brooks Pest Control knocked on my door, wasn't wearing a mask, in the middle of a sheltering in place and was told three times NO THANKS.  He wouldn't take NO for an answer and even went so far as to point out a spider web on my porch and say YOU HAVE SPIDERS,  aren't you afraid of spiders? .... he assumed because I'm female I'm afraid of spiders.  I told a couple people at work about Chase from Brooks Pest control and they also had dealings with his pushy @$$<//Review>

When they sell you the service, they indicate it will take about 90 minutes each time to treat pests and remove cobwebs.  In reality, they come once a month and spend about 20 minutes, or less.  Cobwebs are still everywhere in abundance.  Their service people don't care!<//Text>

As a pest control service you should be aware that they do not handle Carpenter bees. I was under the impression that Brooks was a pest control business. Not very happy at the moment.< /text>

I received a call from Brooks informing me that there is a scheduled work the next day. I told her i thought my contract is complete so they don't have to come, because i don't want to renew. She informed me that the contract is for five sessions and not four so they have to do it. I told her i don't want them to come and if there is any amount due in the contract to just charge me for whatever is due. She told me if i don't want them to come she will charge me $249 for cancellation. Today i received an email from Brooks informing me that my account has been charged $249 cancellation fee. At this very difficult time in our lives (pandemic) when people are not able to work, who does that?<//Text>

They were supposed to spray and knocked down webs inside and out. We had to leave the house for over an hour while he did this. There are spiders and webs everywhere. Not happy with my service at all this month.<//review>

<text>Someone from this company came to my house today and was very forceful and tried to trick me into signing up for a year long contract. Not honest at any point in the sale so I decided not to go with them as I don't want to be a part of a dishonest company.

<review>This business is terribly dishonest. By reading other reviews that people have left I can tell that I’m not the only person to have this bad of an experience. Bad service, management, and technicians. One Star!</review>< gmap_id>

Update: this was also more than the amount remaining if I had stayed in their normal contract. To clarify, the charge to leave was more than the cash due for the remaining services in the agreement. After leaving this review,  they offered me money to take this review down and I refused. Guessing that’s why they don’t have as many 1 stars on here.<//review><GmapID>0x808fe89d2381e3ff:0xe8a1af4e1112e48b< /GmapID>< Pictures>

<text>We just started the services with Brooks.

Very happy with the first visit by Bryan and Landon. They called ahead to give me an eta of arrival, were courteous and educated me about the work done in and around the house. Having worked with large corporates in the past, I am very pleased with the brooks services and plan to stick with them.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Please read the contract no matter how nice and reassuring the salesperson is. This review is about the customer service and initial spray, as I did not end up continuing my service after the initial spray(due to financial issues in my home). The customer service was very helpful and able to help me work through my contract and understand that I needed to cancel my service within 3 days of signing said contract or I would be charged part of the contract to cancel. Without their email support, I would not have understood it, as the salesperson was misleading. When I specifically asked about the ease of cancelling my service if necessary(I don't like commitment for his very reason), they assured me there was nothing to worry about and to take my time deciding. I trusted this salesperson and didn't closely read the fine print until it was almost too late. Luckily the online support was able to accept my cancellation on time and I've had no problems. Nothing bad about the company, it's business, though I wish they sprayed for fleas and ticks which was another reason I wanted to cancel, just read the contract and don't be fooled. Thank you customer service rep!<//Text>

<text>Many of my neighbors are using Brooks, so I decided to give them a shot, and I've been very pleasantly surprised by their level of service and attention to detail.

Landon and Brian were our technicians, and they took the time to explain everything they would be doing, and to ask questions about the specific types of pests we have been seeing, so they could treat appropriately.

They assured me I could reach out to them any time I had concerns, and even offered to come back for a follow up once we have installed our front lawn.

Give them a shot, you won't be disappointed!<//text><Resp>None< /Resp>< name>

<Name>MARIE RUTLEDGE<//Name><review>I really want to give this company no stars and am thinking of contacting an attorney and starting a class action lawsuit. The person at the door told me they worked for this company for 2 years and I understood it to be a service term of about 4 months. About two months in to the service I called and complained that I did not notice a difference in the amount of bugs my house is inundated with. I also told them when the 4 months was up , I would not be renewing because I didn’t notice there being much of a difference to keep paying for a service I didnt see doing much of a difference. I never heard that it was a year contract or that I would be charged for cancelling and I had called a few times. I was told that my card would not be automatically charged and the service wouldn’t be renewed on its own . I was also under the assumption by what the sales guy said at the door that you call and schedule your treatments and when I called in I was told I could use them as much as I wanted within those four months. I did call after having about two services done that I wanted the inside done but I had an emergency and I cancelled that day and I never called them back. I felt it really was of no use because there are so many bugs, so why pay for a service or use a service you don’t see working. They sent an email that the next term was due of $119 and that they had just finished a service. I called them today from Tracy, Ca that I had called and told them I didn’t want to renew in the 4 months and that I have not called for a service since I canceled the last service because I had an emergency so they wouldn’t be able to do the inside and therefore I had no more contact with them until this email. She stated that the service had been being performed every month that they had been coming in their own without my knowledge or consent nor have I seen anybody out. I think this is very fraudulent as I have a big area that should of been don’t if they really had been coming and that my front is very tiny but that I have a big area in the back with a pool and several gates and the gates are not locked so you been sending someone out without contacting us to spray a tiny front and not asking what we want done? No because they are scheming and scamming. I called today and now was told there were no notes in the system and if I said I wanted to cancel I would of been told to pay a fee. I told the Customer Service Rep Alex once again I wouldn’t have used the words cancelled because I had no knowledge of being in a year contract. I am new to the area and new to the home why would I sign up for a year contract without knowing if I like the service I was being given. To me she was rude and condescending saying the same things, trying to trip me up like I didn’t know what I was saying or talking about. I asked to speak to the Manager which she said was Marissa and that she was gone for the day as I called at 4:51 tonight on December 17, 2019. I said I would give her a call tomorrow and she told me not to call, I will have her call you. I told her during my call that I sense fraudulent behavior and after reading these comments after I decide at 6:52pm to look online to see if I am the only one that has had this problem and I see that I have not so this is obviously a pattern of unethical behavior. So I will be conducting appropriate officials tomorrow regarding this issue.< /review><Rating>1< /Rating>< pictures>

<review>They hardly do anything, Hardly spray anything, if you don’t like service they want $200 plus to cancel. This is on top of what you have already paid to get ripped. Stat away.< /review>< rating>

We had heard about Brooks from a couple of family members who used them and had good experiences.  Jake came out to spray the outside and inside of our house.  He was on time, professional, friendly and communicated clearly what he was going to do.  His time estimates were accurate as well.  We are pleased with the service and really glad we got Jake.  We signed a year contract with them so looking forward to good results!< /text>

I'm giving it one star because the sales eagerly sold me a one-year contract without informing me of $160for early cancellation.  I gave it a try for two sprays and I just could not see any difference or any need to continue the service. Then I got hit with $160to cancel the contract. I figure it's cheaper than continuing a service I don't need. Buyer be aware, don't fall for their door to door sales for a service you don't need. What a shady company！never tell you about cancellation fee！< /Review>

< Review>
I was initially hesitant to change my pest control service from Axxxxe (guess who) to Brooks, but when I saw how Will treats my house, I changed my mind without any hesitation and doubt. He is extremely skillful and knowledgeable (probably "the" best guy for 10 years of my house ownership) and did much more better job than previous guys in my opinion. I highly recommend Brooks.<//Review>

<Text>Thank you Will! He came out on time and great personality. He sprayed and advised me on his finds.  I have noticed lots of small spiders. Worried about what more could be in the fields behind us. Thankful to Brooks for coming by offering service. Look forward to continued service.<//Text></record>

<Text>I don't write reviews very often and the only time I do, is if I receive consistent or superior performance. I'm pretty high maintenance when it comes to the quality of service I expect and Brooks Pest Control and Charlie W. has done what very few are able to do - EXCEED my expectations. It was refreshing to have a pest control technician come to my home that was true to being highly professional and thorough. Other technicians that have come to my home, I didn't even want to open the door for them or have them return! But Charlie W. was friendly and pleasant to talk to, knowledgeable, and patient with me when I explained and showed him every nook and cranny I wanted him to spray/remove the webs and it was easy to talk to him about all my concerns. Even in the 100+ degree weather, he took his time to make sure my needs were met and since then, my pest problem has significantly decreased and pretty much eliminated! I definitely have spread the word to my friends, family, and coworkers that Brooks and Charlie W. delivers beyond their word. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM!< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Happy with initial service. Bryan and Landon were awesome! They called ahead of time and kept me posted of their ETA.  I had an attic access space near my bed and Bryan made sure that area was well guarded against pests coming through. He even help me slide a piece of furniture out of the way to gain access. I admit I asked for extras and they were gracious to accommodate my requests of extra spraying and trap laying.  Landon swept outside porch eaves and sprayed in and outside of garage where daddy long legs were taking over.  They were fast and professional. Will update in a month or so to see if number of pest significantly reduces.< /Review>

We have opted for Brooks pest control and today while on their regular visit I explained to them about issues with mice sneaking inside our house..Landon and Brian awesome team, they listened to my concern and assisted in trying to figure out from where the mice were coming in, and have asked me to follow up if the issue does not resolve in two weeks..they have temporarily blocked the entry for mice and I really appreciate Landon for listening patiently to me and providing the right guidance.<//Review>

<text>I'm giving it one star because the sales eagerly sold me a one-year contract without informing me of $230 for early cancellation.  I gave it a try for two sprays and I just could not see any difference or any need to continue the service. Then I got hit with $230 to cancel the contract. I figure it's cheaper than continuing a service I don't need. Buyer be aware, don't fall for their door to door sales for a service you don't need.</text><rate>1<//rate>< time>

Abdale worked in detail in the interior of my house to ensure all the webs are removed & spider picked up & killed; while Landon worked diligently outside.  In addition, he make sure that some gopher holes are filled with granulated poison.  They both have performed a service that is above & beyond!  Thank you!<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>In these past couple of days I have noticed some small pests in and around my home. Yesterday, Eric greeted me at the door as if he read my mind! He was very informative and professional. I made an appointment for the next day, today, due to pest activity in the garage. The Pest Techs, Landon and Brian, just now completed spraying and trap setting. They were courteous and took their time to answer any questions I had. So far, so good. I will keep you all updated!<//Text>< Pictures>

I saw a mouse in my kitchen last night. A friend of mine recommended Brooks Pest Control because they are cheap and professional. I called Brooks first thing the next day and before the end of the day I had a professional at my home taking care of the problem. I use them quarterly and haven’t had any problems with anything ever since. Definitely would recommend them.<//Review>

They did a good job with not only the house but getting from where my grass starts in the front yard to my backyard fence literally and all products safe! I have two English bulldogs and babies under 1 so this was a must! Definitely recommend! Oh and they come out every quarter(3 months) but if needed they can come once a month, let’s say for free!! To do another spray because let’s face it I’m more scared of spiders then they are of me and I refuse to kill them so this helps with less of us seeing each other  lol</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I've never had pest control services before (I'm not a big fan of salesmen) but the guy who came to my door (Braxton) was very personable and helped answer a lot of my questions.

I used to spray my own house which helped but never eliminated the problem.  I don't know if these guys use some sort of super spray or something but I haven't seen an ant or a spider inside my house for almost a month.  THANKS GUYS!</text>< pictures>

<Text>Brooks is the 3rd pest control business we've tried. My wife and I stopped using the other businesses because they were never very thorough with the treatment...we were constantly having to call the business and have them come back to re-spray....The other company I felt was just non-professional.
We just started with Brooks about 2 weeks ago and have been very pleased with their services. They do a thorough job and are very professional. Assuming they remain the same I'll be A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE!<//Text><Name>Brock Davies< /Name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Sales person didn't tell us that there was a cancellation fee. Also I didn't see any difference. We have the same amount of spiders etc. they come every three months and it cost us $400 a year. When our contract is up we will not renew.

<Review>I have the same case as most of the people here. The sales person did not inform me about the cancellation fee properly and gave me a huge discount. I do not see ANY value in the service being provided in the two sprays and I do not want to continue the service but they are asking $250 for the contract termination. Seems like they are a shady company and you should steer clear of them.<//Review><resp>{'time': 1576726217167, 'text': 'Hi Faisal, I’m sorry for the misunderstanding with the sales rep. Let me look into your account and I’ll give you a call and see what I can do. Thanks, Happy Holidays!'}</resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>My mom has been meaning to get her house sprayed, perfecting timing when Justin approached her cause she didn't need to look online. Justin was so helpful and kind towards her, she was really sick and could barely speak. Braxton was the one who sprayed the house. We have animals in the house and in the backyard. When he knocked on the door, of course the dogs barked, he was really understanding I couldn't open the door all the way and we had to speak through a small crack. I let him into the backyard and was really sweet to our pet, he made sure she wasn't near by. Thank you Justin and Braxton for helping my mom out!< /Review><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x808fe89d2381e3ff:0xe8a1af4e1112e48b< /gmapID></record>
