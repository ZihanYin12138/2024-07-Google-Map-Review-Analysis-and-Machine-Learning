<Rate>5<//Rate><user>101257187742629598731< /user><review>AMAZING!  I ordered the Basil Chicken Wings and Sweet Potato Fries.  Feels like I was falling in love.  I also love their Lemon Grass Chicken Sandwich, not a fan that it is now mandatory as a combo with chips and a smoothie, however, today they informed me you can exchange the chips for salad and you can get soda instead of the tea/smoothie, I'm excited to order it again next time!</review>< GmapID>

<rating>5<//rating><text>My husband and I wanted to try something new but were in the mood for garlic noodles. Found this spot on Yelp.

I got the premium bbq combo with garlic noodles and a fried egg. It came in a cute disposable bento box with pickled and steamed veggies. With a slice of pineapple delicious. Everything had great flavor and very filling.
My husband got the chili shrimp and spicy garlic noodles which were also great. We also order the super fruit organic jasmine drink and the organic mango smoothie pearl which this one reminded me of boba but with jellies instead of tapioca balls.

Overall was a great first impression and we will be coming back.<//text>< Pics>

A welcome higher end Pho restaurant in the Dublin area. Clean and modern. Upscale utensils and presentation. Good quality. The main area for improvement is in the temperature of the broth. The bowl is the same for regular or large. After mixing, the food is not warm enough, especially for the large order. Basil chicken also not hot off the fryer.<//review>

Various options in here, from Pho to rice. it's close to Outlets, about 10 mins drive. If you would like to have a noodle soup after shopping, this is the place you could go to. Inside is very cute and cozy, but seats are limited.< /review>

For me to give 5 stars everything has to be perfect. The food here was really good. Had the popcorn chicken, spicy beef pho, and the tofu rice with egg on top. The drink was tasty as well. Got the ocean. It is very cramped in there...maybe 8" between tables. Not a big space. Would recommend for sure. Take out would be pho king amazing. Lol.  Check me on twitch hugh_ginvaney. Enjoy!<//review>

I came here today, their decoration is very special with milk tea and pho. I like their pho the most with the special broth. The broth is different the other Vietnamese restaurants, and I talked to the owner, he said the broth is cooked with their special recipe. They are close to the shopping plaza, it is good for a rest after a crazy shopping!<//Text>

Service is great, very clean environment, many selections on the menu, Vietnamese based foods and they added some fusion taste, the tomato crab noodles give another level of taste 😝 yummy

<review>Really enjoyed their rice dish with the basil pork and fried egg. Also comes with a salad and egg roll.  All of their homemade dressings/sauces were yummy.
We also got their beef pho combo and chicken pho.  Beef broth was good but the chicken broth wasn’t very strong - odd that it had broccoli in it too.
Popcorn chicken was in thin strips - different that what we are normally used to.
Overall very pleased with our quick dinner and service was friendly.  Will definitely return!</review>< Date>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>Reviewing the garlic noodle dish, this place has unique sauces, very tender chicken and has a heavy garlic aroma from the noodles. Including  a salad and imperial roll makes this a balanced meal. If the noodles are more al dente the rating will definitely be higher.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Really like this place. It’s a bit like French style Vietnam. The food selection is simple yet look yummy. Their service is nice and accommodating. We had seafood pho, Basil Lime Wings, and Laksa noodle. All are tasty, not overly. Definitely will come back to try other dishes.< /review>

<Text>Pho and Thai Tea was good. Unfortunately I only tasted the pho that my girlfriend ordered and I ordered a Bahn Mi and Wings. It turned out to be a reasonably tasty Bahn Mi, but should not be delivered as it was incredibly soggy by the time it arrived. The basil wings were undercooked and flavorless and I only ate two before throwing them out. I am writing this review at 5 am after 2 hours of stomach pain/vomiting which whether it was the wings or not they are certainly a likely culprit.</Text>< pics>

Food was great, had a ton of flavor. Portions were overly generous. I'm a big dude with a large appetite, was full halfway through my meal. Ordered vermicelli with lemon grass chicken. Came with a jalepeno chutneys, fish sauce, and a salad dressing. All house made with great flavor. The real draw though is I'm a milk tea addict. I got the Ancient Black Fresh Milk Tea. This is some of the best boba tea I've had, maybe the best. I'm not a boba person, usually omit it, just do straight tea brown sugar, or crema. Not with this tea. The boba is stupid fresh with the perfect chewiness to it.  Can't wait to try them again. And yes I would totally stop by just for tea alone. Food is just a bonus to me.</text>

<text>Randomly found this pho place close to liver mall. I ordered a regular size of pho and surprisingly, the amount of beef is quite a lot. For expensive place like Dublin, I don't think you can pay $11 for such size of pho. And taste was above average. They also have some fancy boba teas too but I didn't  get the chance to try. Definitely will go again next time after shopping from livermall.<//text>< pics>

Worst parts yard we have ever dealt with.  Sold us a bad engine and after 30 days and over 20 calls still have not resolved the issue.  Never buy the cheapest engine on car-part.com because its almost always the "bad" one.  They knew it was bad yet sold it too us anyway. Use LKQ.</review>

<text>They did not open exactly at 8:00 AM as mentioned, I had to wait about 10 minutes. When I got in the service was horrible, the guy helping me was rude. He said the part I was looking for can be ordered for a ridiculous amount of money!!!

Very very poor  and rude customer service.  Looks like the people sitting in the desk are doing  us a favor by selling parts to customer.  4 people sitting in desk and one of them posing toward the rack even when I told them I do not know the size.  Very very rude and impolite customer service.</Text>

<text>Had a pick up scheduled in a nearby town, 40 minutes away from where I live. I was given a three hour window. I waited around for nearly 7 hours, hoping against hope that these guys would show up. They not only never even showed up, I never even received a courtesy phone call telling me they were going to be late or not going to be there at all. On top of that I never even heard from the company itself!
Stacy, the dispatcher, was cordial and tried to be helpful,  but that is the very best I can say about my experience with Allied.<//text>< pics>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>So dustin is gone and the guys who are left dont understand their computer system and they're also obstinately lazy. So they're not going to try to learn it. After the Ebay guy sent me the wrong transmission I still wanted to do business. He didn't get back to me so I had to find the store. And I brought them the transmission to save hassle. I just want the transmission, and I would pay more for the right one. But these guys couldn't even look it up. If they tried they could learn how it works, but they dont even want to try. their system has a database to look up parts it's a huge part of their job. So I said can you look up the part so I have the right one?  Frank said he couldnt look it up. He just could not.  But the ebay guy would give me a number and repeat the wrong make and model of the car. I would tell him thats the wrong car and he would say it again with a different make and model. And we did that a few times. Idk if it's a joke or if he's sitting there from memory not touching his computer. I never got the right transmission. Hopefully I can count on him to send my refund like he said he would, and I can get it somewhere else.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<name>Cerva La< /name><date>1497293118448<//date><rate>1</rate><text>Horrible service that cheated me on my warranty. I asked for it when I originally made the worst decision to purchase a part here. The axle immediately went bad just over 2,000 miles. You do not get good parts here, it's up to you to jimmy rig any part they give you onto your car. If you buy the warranty and the part goes back be ready for them to act like they didn't sell you a warranty. Lots of fun.

If they don't get you in the office, the first time I picked up my axle the forklift driver dropped it and ran over it damaging park of the e-brake assembly. This time he hit my car with his forklift. You've been warned.</text>< pics>

Very fake    think they better than you from a owner you would think she  would show a little more respect and not act like your so dumb because she knows it all when it comes down to the salvage industry.. damn sleazy waitress ..they  treat their employees bad  dont even offer water to them they sell them water  .after all that money they make for you and your going act like it's not good enough  but  here you are buy a water cuz we dont want you passing from this heat. NOT A PLACE  I WOULD RECOMMEND.<//Review>

<Text>STAY AWAY!!! We purchased an engine for a customer... These guys offered a warranty for an extra $200... One cylinder of the engine failed (started making a rod bearing noise approximately 800 miles later/less than a month)... They told us that we had to leave a deposit to get another engine, but they said that the engine was not covered under warranty (how can they know when we still have the engine?!!)... It's true what Aaron said... They sell you extra warranties, but they don't honor them... THEY WILL FIGHT YOU ON ANY RETURNS... THEY'RE NOT HONEST... STAY AWAY AND AVOID HEADACHES!!!</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

These guys are rude people and aren't very helpful when you are calling for an inquiry on their inventory.  I get you're a salvage yard.  But have your employees get some training on customer service.

From the call, I am assuming any of the reviews that are high here are fabricated.  I can't imagine these guys selling anything to anyone.< /review>

Rude, could tell they hate their job, even rude to/trash talking the owner, and quoted saying “I just wanna finish and get out of here” to me. I just feel bad for the loyal customers that have to deal with this. Some spring cleaning on employees is recommended if you’d like returning customers. The young gentleman and one girl were very sweet and helpful.</text><name>Karla Aguilar< /name><time>1617760435402<//time></record></dataset><record>

Great place to shop for clothes. The only problem is that it's a bit pricey. Love all the different types of clothing brands there is and shoes and other products. Very good place to shop for back to school for kids as well only if ur willing to spend more then what u think.</review>

I came to this store looking to buy sweet pants and tee shirts. The Asian woman (I Do not know what she is) approach me and took the items I had and walk away saying nothing when I was looking at other items. Weird! Go elsewhere.<//review>< Pictures>

Just collected my Black Audi Q5 from Brian at Dentco and am honestly the happiest customer in the world. After living in Manhattan and with two young kids, the bodywork was absolutely riddled with dents (over 22), paint chips and scrapes - not to mention a deep 8 inch scratch in the tailgate where it lifted and scraped the garage roller door. After moving to California, the heat and parking outside has also taken its toll - for a three year old car, it looked like it had been in wars. I couldn’t believe it was mine when I collected it - the paint and repairs make it look like new. The tailgate and bumper look brand new and the finish on dents and scratch repairs are faultless. I expected good things given the reviews I’ve read but I’m absolutely blown away with the work. If like me you’re looking for someone trustworthy and honest, with solid pricing and absolute first class work, look no further. HUGE thanks Brian. Awesome guy, awesome job.<//text>

I picked up my car today from Dentco. Brien, the owner has one thing you don’t see much these days. The guy has pride and integrity. We had a little disagreement but the way he handle it was just PERFECT!
I realized how he has earned the 5/5 customer rating. I will not hesitate to go back to him or refer my best friend. Thank you Brien and please don’t change.</Text>

Special Thank you to Brian & his staff, they were able to fit me into their schedule as promise, I stopped by to let Brian see the area of the damaged area, upon completion the dent wasn't even noticed.

I wouldn't have an issue to refer Dentco to anyone.< /Review>

I was referred to Dentco by a friend to have a fairly good sized dent removed from our new Explorer. I used to own and run a paint and auto-body business myself and new this would be a difficult dent to remove. But based on the referral, I had fairly high expectations that Brian could get most of the dent out even though it was a difficult one. They totally exceeded my expectations! The dent is gone completely. He did a great job, was great to interact with, and charged a fair price. I highly recommend him.< /review>

Raul, worked on my 1997 Lincoln town car and did an absolutely incredible job, I couldn’t be happier. For a great price he took out a lot of dents, even ones I didn’t see and some I thought were probably impossible to pull, but he did his magic in a few hours ,very impressed!!!! I recommend everyone to please go here, best I’ve seen, no bulls**t!!< /Text>

Took my Porsche Panarema to Brian over at Dentco last week willing to take a chance away from the place I usually go to that specializes in Porsche.  The results and service was AMAZING!!!.  I already told friends, co workers and family if you ever need body work go to this place.  His prices are VERY reasonable.  Workmanship is exceptional</review>

Brian is a miracle worker! Unfortunately, I’ve learned first hand how “soft” the Tesla Model 3 space grade aluminum hood is with a 2” mystery dent that not only dented the hood but also the honeycomb layer beneath it. In my search for someone to repair this I was looking for someone with a keen attention and appreciation for detail. Brian at Dentco is an artist who simply gets it, and has the knowledge and experience to get the job done. He got me in same day and had my car done in an hour and we had a good conversation to top it off. Long story short, my dents are completely gone, like they never happened.</Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>I  had my new Colorado truck for a week when I took it to the car wash.  I swung the door open wide when exiting the truck and hit the concrete base supporting the vacuum cleaner.  The result was a large dimple about an inch from the edge of the door.  I was sick.  I found Dentco on the internet with all 5 star reviews. When  I called him Brian the owner agreed to meet me the following day at his shop in Laguna Hills.  Although he was busy with other customers, he agreed to do my truck while i waited.  It took about 90 minutes and the result was astonishing,  the dimple was gone.  GREAT workmanship.  Highly recommend Dentco and Brian Jump.  This is a very well run small business and they are nice people too!< /text>< pics>

His work is excellent and is done in a timely manner. He has a most welcoming personality and has become like a friend to me because I have been there many times.

Five stars is not enough for this place!  I brought my rogue in for a big dent on the driver's side.  When I got my car back, it looked amazing!  I was shocked at how low the price was too!  Brian is a perfect example of what truly great customer service is. I recommend calling them first. They are well worth it!< /review>

<text>I chose Superior based on the 5 star reviews, and let me say, Brian has another 5 star review from me!  My Prius had a small, deep door ding that was painfully obvious.  I called Brian, he said bring it in now, he took one look, said I'll have it done in 10 minutes and gave me a very reasonable price quote.  When he brought my car back I was amazed; honestly he must've done some sort of  magic back there because the dent was COMPLETELY gone. I couldn't believe my eyes.  Great price, fast, immediate service, and a perfect result. I can't recommend Brian enough!</text><date>1541540171754</date>< username>

<text>Brian is well educated on repairing dents and scratches and a very personable human being.  He takes his time to explain options and offers a price too good to be true.  He repaired my scratched dented front bumper on my Jeep grand Cherokee SET  for  $320.  I had two other quotes ($690 and $995) from reputable local businesses nearby ..one commented "I know it's sounds expensive...you own an expensive  vehicle."  The other commented "it's more difficult than it looks..we have to remove the entire front bumper and it's very timely."  My car is perfect...go to Brian..oh and thanks Brian!</text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Paintless Dent Removal made the process of getting a dent removed from my car so easy! No need to shop around. The dent was in a difficult spot on my car so we were anticipating a high quote, but Brian gave us a great price and took care of it in a very timely manner. Will definitely bring our cars here for any & all future dents!!<//review>

Need Tesla work?   Brian is the only PDR I will ever use.   After being rejected by two PDR companies due to body line issues and getting estimates from body shops for as much as $5,000, Dentco completely removed the dent for $340.   I wouldn't go anywhere else - EVER!< /Review>

Crazy how some of these local bodyshops don't know that paintless dent repair is possible for these repairs. Always pays to try Paintless before painting. Not to mention the vehicle history report they slap on the car once insurance is involved  (ruining vehicle resale values)."}</Resp><GmapID>0x80dceec249b76141:0xcbd24e6147b2b962</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Brian did his magic from over 25 years experience and got my car looking brand new again. You would never know the dent was ever there!!!!
This is why this Paintless dent removal business has 5 star reviews!!!!
Give him a try and your eyes will be amazed at what a awesome job he does!!!<//Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Our experience at Dentco could not have been more positive.  After receiving several bids from the bigger repair shops on a nasty fender scratch on our new Mercedes, we headed to Dentco
where we met Brian.  His bid was less than half of the others, and not only was the repair done absolutely perfectly, it was ready for us in 24 hours.  Do yourself a favor and head to Dentco!<//Review>

Quick and great service! Brian was very friendly and genuine. Took my 2017 Mustang in to get a dent removed, and it only took about 20-30 minutes. Looks great, and for a very great price. Don't try to remove a dent yourself, just take it here!</Text>

<text>Excellent service!!! They are very honest, professional, and customer oriented.  As we know, time is important these days and these guys completed the job within the timeframe they promised. Besides the great customer service, they do quality work! The nasty dent on my 2016 Mazda3 is no longer visible, and they fixed a smaller door ding (dent) for free! Thanks Superior Dealer Services! You are the Nordstrom of dent repair at a reasonable price.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Took my hail damage maserati to Brian and was completely happy with the work that he did. There must have been a thousand dents all over hood, roof, fenders, doors, trunk and sail panels. Thought for sure he couldn't get them all but gladly I was wrong. I'm certain that there's not a dent he can't repair. Thanks for a job well done.<//text>

Visited here for all the zabiha halal options but I left super underwhelmed. The meats and chicken had so much potential but were so bland even when dressed up with the various sauce options available. There was too much topping on each taco so be sure to order just a couple and ask for extra tortillas. We ordered a bunch of tacos and had too much (bland) filling left over. This place is not the most organized or clean. Also it’s in a very rough looking neighborhood (I was visiting from Chicago so wasn’t familiar) The condiments/toppings that should be refrigerated are the are left out which seems pretty questionable safety wise. Overall a ok place that I likely will not visit again nor recommend highly to others<//Text>

Fared is an Algerian/French super nice owner who is  running the restaurant. The place is very modest compared to the very delicious food they serve.

I really enjoyed the food so much, talking to Fared and the feeling of looking at the wall of the restaurant where people who ate at the restaurant express their love to the food and the place by writing personal comments and sticking a $ bill on the wall.. revolution vibe

Parking is available for free and is adjacent to the restaurant facing the restaurant wall.</Text>

It takes a L.A staple and makes you feel like you have eaten tacos for the first time in your life.  The anticipation in each bite is present all around.  The scene and staff here are great and welcoming.
I ordered the Black-eyed pea falafel, Duck Hash, Smoked Lamb, Cilantro Yogurt Chicken and Merguez-crispy potatoe tacos I also ordered a Beef Brisket and Barbacoa Burrito.

The tacos were right on point the unique garnishes though mainly pickled beets, onion, cabbage and carrots complimented well with the spicy Habanero sauce.  The duck hash did not disappoint the fatty duck melted all around and coated the potatoes.  Smoked Lamb was good and the Merguez sausage.  The burrito will kick your behind they give you such a generous amount of food.  So much to write about this spot bring a group of friends and get lost in a new experience.</Text><time>1520769897563<//time><name>recinos mario<//name>< Resp>

The best thing, besides the food, is the portion sizes. They are very generous and not overpriced like a lot of restaurants. Food is delicious, servers are always polite and very accommodating.< /text>

<text>Man I'm so SLEEP for not knowing this was around the corner from my house. This place is FIRE, super family owned and small business. Which I love because they actually cook their food for customers and not just produce food for money.

The fusion of Algerian cuisine mixed with Mexican food is what attracted me here when I was looking for a Mexican food spot. And I was happy to find such! Anything from lamb, to duck, to Nigerian prepared chicken. And it's NOT JUST tacos, they do burritos, bowls and also quesadilla as well. So many ways to fulfill your taste buds. And the lemonades all taste great.

for a nice price, I cannot complain about anything, I enjoyed the owners conversation and friendless to the food all around a great spot<//text><user_name>Jordan Hence</user_name>< rate>

< Review>
YUMMY YUM*** (low prices, homey atmosphere)

I used to live by this place, always being drawn in by the "Join the Revolution" painted on the door. It's welcoming in a nation that regularly kills its citizens with impunity, and tears families apart. To have a restaurant that overtly positions itself with a more peaceful world is something I will definitely get behind.

The regular menu is something, but to really experience this place you have to wait for their special menus. They have the most wonderful dishes that will probably only show up in LA here. I also appreciate that the prices are waaaay reasonable. I don't have to complain about how unreasonably high everything is like I do with LIT-ER-AL-LY everything else in this city.

I bring my friends here whenever they come to visit LA, it's a necessary.< /Review>

Never heard of this type of food and the place had great reviews. If you blink you'll miss it so pay attention haha. Place is divey as the definition of divey can be but the dude at the front was super friendly and prompt. Lamb tacos, chicken and potatoes, duck are just some of the interesting types of tacos and burritos served with rice and beans as well as other African inspires sides. Very cool decor very Viva Revolution, patrons have left tokens of appreciation for the great food, great prices and great service. Truly worth checking out and supporting the revolution!!< /review>

Amazing tacos. Authentic flavors. You travel the world with every bite inside a hole in the wall joint that's just well lit enough to feel romantic. The view outside is an urban appeal you will not find anywhere but LA. Portion size is perfect , sides are just right with pickled onions , radish and carrots. The spicy harissa adds the right amount of kick. The lamb and brisket were my favorite , the falafel was super tasty but needed some kind of sauce, and the duck tasted exactly like the flavors of north africa and the middle east. Loved everything about this place, except the street parking. :)<//review>

Come for the food, delicious. I ordered shrimp taco, fish taco and veggies. Ordered smoked chicken sandwich for lunch tomorrow. Five stars for the food, setting is interesting, quirky, funky and a little ... well you decide. This was my fourth time there and will be back again.</review>

< review>
Very disappointed! I rushed to get here with my husband and we make it 30 minutes before closing and the guy wouldn't seat us. He said because it was slow today we are closing early! I wonder how with this treatment you wouldn't be slow. Im sure its a matter of time before they shut down. I have never refused to be seated when a restaurant was still open for another 30 minutes. Horrible service</review>

<Review>Diverse selection of tacos. Great to share if you don’t mind a bit of mess. Duck and cauliflower were the highlights. Even if you’re not very hungry recommended to start with 3-4 tacos per person.</Review><user_id>117023443787248137963</user_id>< gmap_id>

<Rating>2< /Rating><review>This place is just okay. The food has good flavor, but the technical execution errors make it difficult to enjoy. The fried cauliflower was not crispy at all and very greasy. The tacos were loaded with meat and definitely needed a 2nd tortilla. I had to take more than half the meat off just to enjoy them properly. Also, I would like to be able to  recommend the yogurt dipping sauce because it tastes amazing but they leave the sauces sitting out and it was warm, so I don't know that it was actually safe to eat. When you walk in it's not clear where you are or what they serve because there is stuff everywhere which makes it feel chaotic. I'm certain I would have purchased more if things were more together. I probably won't return but I'm glad that I got to try it.</review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

This is one of those 5-star places! I was one of their first customers and still going strong. I have brought so many of my friends here and everyone loves this place. It's simple: The food is innovative (fusion of north African and Mexican), very tasty and comes in bulk! What is more? It's cheap too! I recommend the duck hash, pozole and beef brisket barbacoa! Their tacos are signature but I suggest trying the quesadilla too!</text>

<Text>First time coming to this place it was Awsome. The establishment is unique you're greeted by a tasty smell and the service is genuine and friendly. If you're looking for diverse food this is the place I've tried their duck hash and it was amazing!. Perfect place for a date.
Wait time wasn't the best however the food is worth it and the atmosphere makes up for it. Lastly it is a small place and parking may be hard to find but it differently worth the experience and that says allot. Can't wait to go again.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Never heard of this type of food and the place had great reviews. If you blink you'll miss it so pay attention haha. Place is divey as the definition of divey can be but the dude at the front was super friendly and prompt. Lamb tacos, chicken and potatoes, duck are just some of the interesting types of tacos and burritos served with rice and beans as well as other African inspires sides. Very cool decor very Viva Revolution, patrons have left tokens of appreciation for the great food, great prices and great service. Truly worth checking out and supporting the revolution!!</review>

<text>This place lives up to the reviews! We had a sampling of tacos here, and they were all delicious. The duck hash taco on a blue corn tortilla was out of this world! I also really enjoyed the shakshouka taco, a delightfully spiced blend of eggs, peppers, and onions. We will certainly be back soon!</text>< Pics>

<text>This is a great hole in the wall Algerian fusion restaurant. The food is really good with plenty of variety - the burritos are huge while the tacos are small but come over flowing with meat. The beef barbacoa is my favorite. The owner is really friendly and greets all his customers. Also, the fake quotes on the walls are hilarious.</text>< rate>

The Falafel is very crunchy and has this weird and nasty taste that I did not like at all. The yogurt chicken was dry and bland. One taco that I would truly recommend is the brisket taco, it's very juicy and worth your money.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

While some may call this fusion, the flavors are completely authentic. The LA Times called chef Zadi the reigning King of fusion cuisine, the proof is in the food. Sparse decor because everything goes into the food. Unpretentious and friendly staff. Customers look like the United Nations.< /Text>

Dirty place and terrible food.  Tacos came dripping water from beef and chicken.  Both my wife and I felt sick after eating the food.  I wish we left the the place without eating.  Seating area and sauce containers weren't particularly clean either.<//Text>

<Review>Dy-no-mite! The place is all about the food and the neighborhood. Farid hangs out on the sidewalk, smoking lamb, curing beef bacon, and roasting duck for the delicious tacos. He's always got a laugh and a hug for the customers. His partner/wife handles the operations. She makes sure everything runs smoothly and is fresh. Perfect balance.

My favorites tacos are the roasted cauliflower (don't miss it, do yourself a favor), the roast duck and potato, and the smoked lamb (what I said about the cauliflower? apply it here). When I want to eat big, I get the semolina pancakes with orange maple syrup during brunch.

All hand made condiments, drinks, and desserts. And did I mention very reasonable prices? Well, I should have. Gluten-free corn tortillas and tons of vegetarian, too.

Park on the side streets for free, in front if it's not rush hour, and enjoy yourself some North African food prepared by a French North African!< /Review><rating>5< /rating>< Pictures>

It was terrible. I walked in and requested that I have an order of chicken tacos with cilantro and onions and the guy at the register tells me that they're "not like every other taco joint" so some older guy walks over and I asked him the same thing and he said yeah we can do it plain. And I told him why did he tell me I couldn't, he then gets a terrible attitude with me talking about how the kid is his son...okay. He walks away and he tells me I have to pick something off the menu, and I said do you usually modify for customers and he tells me no right after his "dad" just said yes. Then some lady in the back cooking potatoes is like no modifications because there are too many tacos for them yo make. I am allergic to dairy and I couldn't get a plain taco because they had "too many tacos to make".
I was really excited to come here and was disappointed with the customer service, they were very rude and on top of that the employees couldn't answer any of my questions without teaming up on me. This place is not family friendly and has terrible customer service, I would not recommend at all.</Text>

Good God. These burritos.

This absolute hole in the wall run by chef / owner Farid Zadi is one of the best taco joints I've experienced in a long, long time. Farid was very welcoming when my friend and I came by today; she had been hyping up everything on the menu for the past 2 weeks, and it did not disappoint.

I grabbed the pozole burrito with a side of Algerian samosas, filled with spinach and feta, and both were packed with flavor and filling. I also got a chance to try my friend's order of fried cauliflower, and they were fantastic as well.

Needless to say, I'll be coming back here to try everything I can!< /Text>

Visited here for all the zabiha halal options but I left super underwhelmed. The meats and chicken had so much potential but were so bland even when dressed up with the various sauce options available. There was too much topping on each taco so be sure to order just a couple and ask for extra tortillas. We ordered a bunch of tacos and had too much (bland) filling left over. This place is not the most organized or clean. Also it’s in a very rough looking neighborhood (I was visiting from Chicago so wasn’t familiar) The condiments/toppings that should be refrigerated are the are left out which seems pretty questionable safety wise. Overall a ok place that I likely will not visit again nor recommend highly to others</Text>

<review>The refreshing refreshment they had that I can’t say no with is their Watermelon and Pineapple Lemonade. This is the reason why I always stop by @ Revolutionario: North African Tacos.  I had Beef Barbacoa, Duck Hash Taco and Smoked Lamb Taco were my best choices for Taco. I Love to stay here for dinner with friends but of course they also do have selections for desserts. I’m in the right place,  why won’t you? Must try!!!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c2c7f7c5106149:0x39f262ea2be85a5d< /gmapID></record>

Taco's so good, I couldn't be bothered to take photos of my food. No really.

We tried almost all of the taco's on the menu, and I think the smoked lamb has my heart. The chicken with the cilantro yogurt sauce also blew my mind, as did the veggie options, oh man those chickpeans and sweet potatoes were AWESOME.

Being this isn't too far from where I call home, I expect to visit this spot often.<//Review>

<review>Revolutionario, the birthplace of the North African Taco, is another one of my favorite Los Angeles spots. They not only have great food at reasonable prices - but they are also highly engaged with the local community (as I understand, they do work feeding the homeless). In my experience the chef and staff are friendly, engaging, and have created a space that reflects this. I've been to Revolutionario at least 5 times now, I've ordered something different each time, and the food has always been excellent and unique.

The portions look sort of small due to the way they are served but are very filling. I tend to order a "bowl" over the taco or burrito, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend any style. Top off your dish at the sauce and toppings bar to accentuate the great medley of flavors (their harissa and yogurt sauces are fantastic). I like to pair the hot food with the sweet, fruity drinks they have available on tap.

Definitely a worthwhile local trip from anywhere in the city - or if you're visiting the USC area.< /review><username>Chad K< /username><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80c2c7f7c5106149:0x39f262ea2be85a5d</gmapID><userid>118340948866946722024</userid></record></dataset><record>

Taco ingredients were good, tortillas didn't hold up to the juicy meats and fell apart. Do I feel my six tacos and drink justified my 20+ dollars? No. I've tried too many taco joints to consider going back.< /Text>

I also got a black eyed peas falafel taco, smoked chicken, shakshuka... yes, this place, the flavors, the portions... really special!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>A great chef fell to earth and began making tacos from the hole in the ground.  Don't mind the sparse decor.  Everything we ordered was yummy, even the date newtons.

So run, don't walk, to Revolutionario.  It's like Guisado's from another world.

Update two years on: still om nom nom. My son says "My, what a big piece of delicious meat.". He's right; the tacos are small but mighty.  The pozole tagine bowl is delicious, too.</Text>< Pictures>

< review>
Revolutionario is an absolutely fantastic little gem of a local spot. When I visited I had a pleasure of meeting Chef Zadi, his staff and family and they were the most hospitable restaurant team on this earth. The vibe felt more like being at someone's backyard barbeque (albeit indoors) than a sterile & boring new restaurant.

What's fantastic are the little bites, the brics and of course, the meat and relishes. I literally sampled 7 things in one sitting without hurting my wallet and all I could do was cry in joy at the complex yet straight-forward nature of the food. I especially loved the play on the pickles with a Berber/French/Korean flare. Everything in the restaurant was top notch quality at a very egalitarian price -- which really falls in line with the whole vibe of the restaurant itself.

I would highly recommend you visit when you can, and say hello to Chef Zadi for me.</review>

<text>The goal of reducing salsa bar waste committed by taqueria first timers is laudable but the sign about garnishes was quite off-putting and unfriendly to me as a first-time customer familiar with salsa bars. I'm sure there's a better way to phrase it.

Overall great taco fillings and toppings, flimsy tortillas.< /text><name>Daniel Reason< /name>< userid>

The staff was very helpful. When they saw our interest in Simpson Pops, the woman showed us some that they were just getting in stock. We waited while they unboxed the brand new stock< /review>

The Game Stop website had an item I wanted listed as available in this store. Sure enough, it was on the shelf and the exact price the website said it would be. The young woman working there with awesome purple hair was friendly and very helpful. There were a lot of cool items in this store. Can't wait to buy more stuff!< /Text>

Manager KENNON plays favorites with their Funko pops. When I called him out on with proof, he became defensive and referred me to gamestop customer service which he provided the completely WRONG NUMBER to while giving attitude. Got the real number to cooperate from online and have proceeded to report that bum. Honestly at this point, all gamestop’s are complete trash due to their employees.<//text>

<text>I thought the lady was coming over to offer a jump start on my classic car was getting from storage. Nope. I was so wrong. Thats only at every OTHER self storage place. Instead this place has a lady scream at you at 5minutes after 6. Not speak loudly, not raise her voice, SCREAM! It’s my first time being at storage after close because every OTHER Public Storage allows access for 3 more hours. If the lady was a little educated, she’d know she’s supposed to get time and half, pay. So for the 10 minutes it took me to get off the site, she’d get paid for 15. Thankfully Home Depot doesn’t have low life’s working that scream at people for being there at closing.</text>< Pics>

LaShaun was very helpful, kind,  and patient . She was very professional and friendly as well as accommodating.  Her customer service skills are very high. LaShaun turned  a stressful situation into a relaxed situation for me. It was truly a pleasure doing business with her.  I give her 10 stars.</Text>

<review>Being at this public storage has been a good experience for me.  The property manager Ms La Shawn is very professional and resourceful.  She set the bar very high. she also keeps the property so nice and clean. I hope  her boss sees this she deserves something special not for going above and beyond.❤ oh and when I needed to up grade my storage space and transfer to a larger unit it was seamless and very close to my old unit. She knew what I needed before I asked. I love the unit.<//review></record></dataset><record>

We reserved our unit online. The manager was professional and polite.  He phoned to ask what time we would be in to sign the rental agreement, so he would be in the office waiting on our arrival. On arrival he was waiting.  He gave us a tour of the facility and our unit, the facility was clean and well maintained. He explained the facilities security measures and gave us various insurance options. He was able to provide a lock and offered other packing supplies.  The interaction was quick and comprehensive. Customer service is 5 star, the facility is 5 star.</Text>

<text>Mireya was so efficient. She got us in and out in less than 30 minutes! My experience so far with public storage (1546 W. El Segundo) has been excellent. The storage is also in a great location- very quiet.<//text>< pics>

<review>People you can trust! I needed a to store my items and without knowing what i need. Public Storage set me up with the perfect size, Julian was a great help. After that every month, they kept me informed of my bill Christina, lovely woman, called me reminding me of my monthly rent. Christina really did help me find what works best for me and right now i am at the process of moving out, if i ever need to come back i know where to go</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Great location and great customer service. I've been a customer here for 10 years and would never think of renting else where. The girls in the office know me by last name and are always so friendly. The gate hours are only from 9:30-6pm but I understand because of the area and I've never had any issues with my space in the 10 years I have stored.</Review>

<Text>I've been a customer at this location for many years and all the girls that work here are so friendly. The property is always clean and someone is always in the office to help you out. I hate the rent raises but I understand public storage needs to be competitive with other companies. Great customer service!!!!<//Text>< Pics>

Knowing that if you have a storage unit with 3 bedrooms of furniture it would be costly to rent a truck and load it up and move it to another storage co.
I would not recomend this location to anyone. I am reporting them to the Better Business Bureau, and Consumer Affairs.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

first of all the young lady forgot to say on Saturdays and Sundays they close at 5 and not 6 so when I came with my stuff to unload they were closed already and I had to wait the next day to put my things in storage and on top of that had to pay an extra day for my U-Haul. Secondly they had a friend of theirs hanging around the office having lunch with them.   Then when I was removing my items from Storage my fiance noticed a roach crawling on the door to the unit. I hope to God my stuff was not ruin by bugs or roaches. when I moved into my new house we saw a roach crawling from my dining table. I only kept my stuff there for a month and 1 week they do not reimburse you like extra storage if you do not use the entire month. which I should have listened to my fiance and went with extra storage space and not Public Storage. when I asked to use a flatbed / dolly they only had one which was already taken by someone else.  There's never one person at the office these girls are always walking around together , instead of having one person in the office and the other person walking around to clean up. Very disappointed. In the future I will choose another company<//text>

The facility is generally clean, but if you're a person who needs access to your items alot this isn't the place for you. They close at 6 pm during the week and 5 pm on weekends, which is generally during normal peoples work hours. Also, if you need long term storage look into other options, I've experienced a 40% price increase in almost 2 years.</Review>

<review>I worked with Lauren in the print department, and she went above and beyond to help me. From choosing the type of paper to figuring out the right quantity to print, she was on top of her game.

I really appreciated the transparency and brilliant customer service - I'd highly recommend going to her with your personal and business printing needs!<//review><Response>None<//Response><Time>1605120520150<//Time>< pics>

Poor service when checking out. There were 2 cashiers open. Only 2 people ahead of me however it was taking forever. Then suddenly this 3rd staff member comes carrying an item w a customer and takes him straight to checkout.  No waiting in line for him! Then closes the register after finishing with him.< /review>

They have a large selection of chairs, mats, office and school supplies, computers/accessories, and have competitive prices.
Even if they don't have the item you may be looking for they will steer you in the right direction offering objective advice.<//Text><Name>nonoyo beezewax< /Name>< user>

I don’t usually shop at Staples but I got dirty looks from so many staff walking in. I hate to pull the color card, but I was the only person of color in the store, and nobody wanted to help. When I asked if I could check out and where to do it, the cashier gave me an attitude. She also wasn’t friendly ringing me up. I tried to smile and tell her to have a great day and she just ignored me and got on her phone. I don’t shop at staples much but when I do, this happens and reminds me why. I’ve been to way nicer staples where I live in La Mesa, but this one over here is terrible. They were also out of stock for pretty much all boxes. Not to mention the customers were rude too (that’s not the stores fault though) and would take up isles with no intention of sharing the isle. I’ve never felt so disrespected going into a store. I wish O never had to come here again.</review>< Pics>

The staff was very friendly,  professional and accommodating.   I needed 10 outages laminated and in spite of the workload,  when I asked to have it done while I wait,  the rep took care of me right away.  I'm very satisfied with the job and happy we'r still have a brick and mortar Staples near me.<//Review>

This is my go-to staples! The staff are always friendly and helpful, and they almost always have what I'm looking for. I use their copy and print center quite a bit, especially for printing up posters.<//review>

<Text>Mr Wootton and Kevin and Jerry were so helpful to me with a printer problem that I had .I have never seen such good service and care in a store. I will definitely buy all my office supplies there. I'm 79 .I'm in a volunteer Ministry and I need help with technology and I found more help there than I have any place I've ever gone to .I definitely recommend Staples .I was at Staples Carmel Mountain San Diego.< /Text>< time>

< review>
(Full disclosure: I use to work at this staples store) The people at this store care and try to do their best. They get things right and try to help people find a solution. They often have great deals on tech if you have a coupon for a "Used" tech product. If you want to save money then buy a "used" table because someone used it for less than a week and returned it. They work just fine trust me. Also you should get their protection plan if you tend to have computer problems. It's really great unless you are a "power user" who knows how to do things on their own computer.<//review>

I prefer the one on mira mesa blvd. If they see you looking like you're lost they come over to help. Not so at this one. I was obviously looking for something and the fuybon the floor was busy tasking. The line was 6 deep before anyone came to help. When I got to the register i realized id forgotten batteries .They were close to the register area. I ask if i could get batteries (hes ringing me up). He said no id have to get back in line which is now 8 deep. This team not very sensetive to customers.<//text>

One star in comparison to Office Depot. I needed a rubber stamp the same day. I had to order it on line. At Office Depot, you walk in with a hard copy or email the file directly to that store and they make it in 15 minutes while you wait. At Staples, if you placed the order 5 minutes after 2 PM, they tell you we do not guarantee we will finish it the same day. I had been on the phone with the lady twice because of confusion designing it on line instead of allowing me to upload a ready pdf file. I called 10 minutes after 2 pm and she told me I cannot guarantee it to be done the same day. They don't take ownership of a job, they prefer it to go through the routine process to make sure you lose patience.

I tried them the day before by calling around 7 PM but I hung up after being on hold for 10 or more minutes.< /Text>

There's this dude who works there, skinny guy with neckbeard, who insisted that I needed a shipping label for my package to ship out. He was right, but he never explained how or why that is, making me fumble left and right for 2 days until I finally got it. And best part? When I sent in my package the USPS truck already left, making my order late and cancelled. Thanks shipping order guy.</Text>< Rate>

Came her a few months ago to get business cards made. Rep I dealt with was a great girl, helped me custom make the cards and design them. Amazing experience.

Come in today to get new business cards with a different design and the representative with the poneytail, who seemed to be a manager, was unwilling to help; kept shutting down every resolution I had with another objection. I really fealt that they just didn't want my business because it would be a little more work for him.

Complete unsatisfactory customer service. He was extremely rude and offered no options to retain my business.</Text>

Really, I don't have a choice since Office Depot closed.
Really hard to find things.  Today I needed Legal Pads and I had to find help to find.  Can you believe that the aisle Header where they were was Pens?</Text>

If you are the type of person that likes quality, this store matches your pocket even if you have no money you can always afford 1 gallon of there best paint would be the same as buying 2 gallons and cheap paint difference is the quality you are taking is by far one of the best paint makers you can get, cabinetry paint is the best, self leveling, creamy texture, very soft on the brush, and the very end up results is always mesmerizing I give 5 stars to this paint not only because I am a painter and I know my paints but the result against the price makes it so worth, as long as you prepare your surfaces correctly you will get a million dollar house type of finish with this paint.<//review>

Warm, friendly and customer focused, this is what i was greeted with by the staff. The energy was overwhelmingly shocking as i have never encountered such fantastic service as what i received at Catalina Paint. Full stars from me< /Review>

I'd give this place 0 stars if possible. I went in guy helping me out had an attitude from the get go I told him I needed to confirm on a color but ends up making the color I didn't want (simple misunderstanding) so he tells me "I can't read your mind bro ." When I had clearly told him to give me a sec continues to be rude calls his manager and explained what had happened luckily the manager seemed to be more relaxed and sorted the whole thing out . Most definitely not going back. That employee needs some customer service classes . It's not hard to just be respectful .<//Text>

Greens are a little rough in spots but the layout and sometimes challenging terrain changes and hazards make for a fun experience! It's worth the trip to play at Reidy.

Great little par 3 course.  It has some length from the blue tees - not a bunch of overly short holes like some similar courses.Very lush and beautiful for the most part, but you'll encounter some road noise on some holes. Seemed to be well maintained, and the staff was great.  I like how there are yardage markers at each location, each tee box.  The course sets a premium on accuracy, and errant shots are easily lost forever.</review>

Love this course,  except for  the  bunkers. If they aren't  going  to maintain the bunkers,  they should just  fill them in and have grass bunkers.</review>

It's a good short game course but many of the greens were nearly unplayable with a lot of damage. Course is very small didn't find much variation unless you play the blues.< /Review>

Course is in good shape.  I liked that they cultivated the dirt in the bunkers so they weren't rock hard as they have been in the past.  Thankfully the frisbie throwers and soccer ball kickers never showed up.</text>

The man I believe to be the owner, stopped me from coming into the clubhouse during the 9 hole turn and asked me what I wanted.  He put his hand up and stopped me from walking in.  I had a mask on per their policy and he acted like I was a second class citizen.  I just wanted to get some snacks and a drink.  After telling him that, he then still thought about it and finally let me in.  It was super awkward and I almost went off on him, but I wanted to finish my round.  O yeah, the sand traps have grass and roots growing in them too.  Poor experience all around.< /Review>

The only thing preventing a 5 star review is the conditions of the bunkers on the course.  They have little to no sand in them and many either have tree roots or patchy grass growing in them.  Otherwise this is a great par 3 course. Max distance is 197 on one hole from the blue tees and that hole plays slightly downhill   The greens run fairly fast especially if you are above the hole.it makes it hard to not have a 5 footer coming back if you miss the downhill putt. Staff is friendly and the price is good. I will be back for more rounds to work on approach shots.<//Review>

Reidy Creek has always been my favorite par 3 course and I still love it, but it appears they are letting it go. Course maintenance is lacking. As far as the bunkers go, there wasn’t any sand in the majority of the pits. Regardless, it’s still a super fun course to play and the staff is always very friendly.</text>

<Text>I cannot say enough good things about this course!   Beautiful, well maintained, very friendly staff, and incredibly reasonably priced!

It was my son's first time out and we rented clubs for me and him.  Clubs were very nice for rentals.  Course was perfect for him and challenging enough for me, too.  The greens were VERY good and the rest of the course was very well maintained... nice sand traps and some good water holes.  Very nice scenery, too.   Make sure you rent a cart, though... there was some distance between some of the holes (at $10 for a cart you can't go wrong). Good beer selection in the clubhouse, too.  All of the staff was very friendly although I must give a shout-out to David who was helping us at the end after our round and in the clubhouse.  Very friendly and helpful.  Gave a lot of good info about the course and the surrounding courses owned by the same management.

A very good course if you are learning but challenging enough for a duffer like myself, too.  We will be back!< /Text>< Pics>

<review>Great course for irons ! It's everything you would expect from the JC golf experience. Always clean and green can't ask more much more. Great beer selection and friendly staff. Makes for a great day of golf.<//review>< pics>

Cool layout. Challenging par 3s. Greens a little slow. Bunkers are awful, muddy. Maybe due to recent tstorms? But a great place to check your iron game.</review>

<rate>1</rate><Text>I was hit by a golf ball from reidy creek while driving south on north broadway. It flew in my window and hit me on the arm. I had a bruise for over a month. City of Escondido owns this golf course. And seem to think it's ok that I was injured by one of their golfer's. Seems they tried to locate the golfer but did not. So I sued them. And what do they do? Lie in court. Shameful.< /Text>< pics>

We play here regularly. It's all par 3s, but the distances and terrain vary. It's an excellent value.</Review>

<Text>I was pleasantly surprised by Del Taco, I really expected them to be a lot like Taco Bell.  That said, the food was great, and the fresh grated cheddar cheese was just delightful.  They also have regular French fries which surprised me for a Mexican food place.  I very much look forward to enjoying Del Taco again..< /Text>< pics>

I find this to be an annoyance. Even though the establishment is open 24 hours the night staff refuse to allow you to purchase all items off the menu. you can not order the, Double Del Cheeseburger, Bacon Double Del Cheeseburger, or the Del Cheeseburger. They will state they already cleaned the grill. The night staff at times can be rude. However, their are a couple good apples though.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

Just a FYI do not go to Dell Taco on West Ave I in Lancaster California I found hair in my food called and told them about it and the manager on duty was very rude. when they never gave me a receipt￼ and I called twice and she hung up on me and she stated that it’s not my problem and when I ask for my money back she said NOPE and hung up on me. So I am calling the health department and the store manager now I feel sick to my tummy.</review>

I love del taco cheese ,but when i get a taco and see this. Its disappointing.  I always buy extra cheese for this reason.  They are extra stingy with the cheese when its taco Tuesday.  They should atleast spread the cheese evenly.  My chicken on my nachos was burnt. The girl in drive thru wasnt very nice. She made me feel like i was sking for too much when i asked for salsa. She never once said your welcome after i thanked her.< /Review>

<Text>Terrible... The cashier at drive thru made zero effort to reach out and get money. On top of that my order had what it looked like a pound if cheese and a tea spoon of meat. I ordered double meat and cheese. Half and half no veggies. It was so much cheese u couldn't even see or taste the meat.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c25ad32e0dbdc5:0x9c8c7b94a9efc6b<//Gmap_id></record>

<review>The old lady working night crew is rude. The other old lady who works with her frequently is incompetent.

So we ordered a few chicken rollers. Instead they have us the new chicken strip tacos. We go back, they give us rollers and it's the wrong kind. Spicy green sauce instead of ranch, Chipotle and secret sauce. It's the spicy green sauce, extra over sauced = extra spicy. My GF doesn't like spicy at all and I don't mind and they were too spicy for me.

So we go back and again tell them they gave us the wrong kind. They finally give us the right "ranch" rollers only there's clearly "Chipotle" as well. Which I love but they were for my GF and she doesn't. So we call it a night and cut our losses.

A few weeks later we go again. She greets us and asks what we'd like and I tell her 2 mobile orders for *our names*. She instantly snaps back that she doesn't have them on her end. I'm like okay, we just ordered so they should be coming through any second and she snaps back again yelling through the mic that she doesn't have them. Again I'm like okay well we just ordered them they should be coming through. Mind you we're the only ones in line. She didn't greet us just asks what we want and then yells at us.

She finally says okay I have one but not the other. Normally they'd just tell us to pull forward while their system gets the order. She's demanding and insisting she doesn't have the order. I think it's possible she was looking at the wrong screen looking for a door dash or Uber eats type order and she finally says she had the order to pull forward. Still being rude AF for no reason.

She hands us a lemonade first and I ask politely if we could get a big straw with it as she gave us no straw and sometimes they give the small straws which can't get the strawberries and she rudely sighs and makes an issue while reluctantly handing us the straw.

We get our food and it's mediocre compared to most typical visits, again, the older lady that works with her messing up the orders.

Honestly she seems like she's on meth and hates her life. I'm sorry but I don't come here to get insulted. I'm sorry if you hate your job and_or life but this is your job, do it right.

Every time we come when she's working it's an issue. Every other time it's consistently better and staff is nice and pleasant. These two need to be replaced or this location is going to suffer. This location is normally busy in to the early 3am+ hours and since she's been there every time I go late night it's dead and I'm sure this is why.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>Massive fail.

I guess the worst most important thing was the lady taking money with her gloves was also touching the inside of cups as she put ice in them with the same gloves.

Makes the fact that my chicken fry box has like half the fries any other Del taco normally puts in it. My favorite Del taco failed massively today.

The glove mo ey thing creeps me out

Don't order drinks here i guess 🤮</Review>< pictures>

Hungry, wanted a Plato, need I say more. A plate of food from a fast food restaurant, need I say more. I remember when Del Taco first started serving them. "Happy Camper a plate a food does make." (My attempt at Yoda speak.) Don't judge me folks. 😏 Anyway, I enjoyed my smothered chicken burrito with the FRESH slices of avocado on top, the rice and beans. Getting chips and salsa with each Plato is a plus.</Review>

The Night Shift lady is super nice, and she gave me exactly what I had ordered. The burritos were the perfect size and I am glad to say this has been the best impression of Del Taco I have ever had the chance of getting so late at night.<//Text>

I generally like Del Taco, but this one is filthy and the employees are very rude. The food is old and cold.<//Text>

I ordered the double Del Burger and repeated it numerous times and the drive-thru worker was unable to get that right she did get everything else correct but nothing else was for me. So I spent $20 on a double Del beef burrito with extra sour cream and cheese and the burger, and a large Shake, and the caramel cheesecake bites which are normally exceptionally good but this time I didn't like them as much. The service is slow since they make everything there but normally the food is better.<//text>

<text>This location on Ave I is going downhill. It's always shortstaffed every time I go. The crew working there are doing the very best they can, but it's not fair to leave them a skeleton crew. It took five minutes until an employee could finally take my order. The ice dispenser in the lobby is broken, but the crew did fill my cup from the drive-thru dispenser. Tables were dirty, but I'm sure the crew will get to it when it's not busy. I suggest the store manager hire more staff to cover everywhere.</text>< time>

I know most people can attest to how absolutely atrocious the staff, food quality, service speed etc. can be at other Del Taco locations especially during the late night hours but these guys are almost always amazing in comparison. I actually go out of my way passing 2 other closer DT locations to come here whenever i get hungry late at night.< /Review>< Pics>

Honestly I don't expect much anymore from some fast food places, this being one of them.  I mean that specifically in terms of customer service so I have neither good nor bad to say there, but I love me some Del Taco! The food is always good, and a good value for the price.</review>

One of the better Del Taco's in the Antelope Valley. With  kind and very courteous helpful staff, (which the DT at the 15th St. West location lacks).
Food is prepared very well and always fast and efficient. Presentation is spot on, and the store is clean.
The 15th Street West store could learn a lot from the Avenue I Del Taco, in all aspects of business and customer service, as well as preparation and presentation of food. This still Taco is as good as you will ever find.</Text>

I like Del Taco on West Ave I in Lancaster Ca which  is closer to my house. They're Professional, Friendly and they fix the food exactly the way their advertisement is. Well I only go to the Del Tacos on West Ave I, East Ave J, and West 15th street. Sorry but the Del Taco on East Ave S and East Union street in Pasadena need to step up and represent as the others do.< /Review>

They took 10 minutes in the drive thru,  then they started handing me someone else's order. I gave it back, they then handed me Something that Looked like my order,  but when I got it home, it was 2 turkey burritos,  Not the grilled chicken burritos that I ordered. When I tried to call, no answer;  3 separate times.</text>

I like Del Taco food and the price is worth what you buy, especially the less than 2 dollar menu</Review>

<date>1459413971277< /date><Rating>1</Rating><Review>Food is great, when it's cooked. From the meat to the eggs, fries and everything, EVERYTIME I have gone to eat here, I get one or more items cold, sometimes like ice in the center. I have even requested that they make sure that it's cooked thoroughly, and I still get cold food. I understand that this is a "Fast Food" restaurant, but cold food is not an option.<//Review>< pics>

Del Taco is a small step above Taco Bell. The best part about them is they're open 24 hours so you can get a big fat burrito anytime.< /text>

<Review>So...mad that this del taco is discriminating against black homeless people...as i was going to fill my cup...a homeless black guy comes in and its hot so he asks for water...and as he coming is when i was going to fill my cup and they shut off the dispenser. I asked her to turn it back on and she gave me an odd look...and only when the homeless guy had left did she ever turn it on....very disappointed in the service and common decency...surprised really...wondering if this is del tacos policy...no buying no respect? I mean really...assuming that he was going to steal like 3 cents worth of soda...i mean really...very sad when a major chain does this...this store needs to learn to treat people like human beings and not by oh they look homeless they will steal stuff...this store sevearly needs to be retrained.< /Review><rating>1</rating><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmap_id>

Its del taco. Drive thru always open, they multiple items for less than a dollar. The carne asada fries are delicious.  The people that work at this one are three times as friendly as typical fast-food place.</Text>

Open 24 hours so hard to complain. Any food is decent after you realize you're a pumpkin. If you see the tweaker looking lady, know you're getting hooked up!< /text>

I always hear a manger with glasses and a pony tail messing around constantly... Its very annoying... And i also over hear her telling empolyees on how she gets over on her boss jennifer? Very unprofessional.. She also didnt wash her hands after dealing with money and which is a big deal because the lady she took money from scratch her butt cheek... She needs proper training in my opinion..</review>

Was in the drive through, and my kid needed to use the restroom.  Pulled out of line, parked, and went inside. Lady tells me I can't use the bathroom unless I buy something, but wallet is in the car console since I was in the drive through. Told her I was going through the drive thru, yet she outright refused to give me a token unless I make a in-store purchase. Went to the car, and he peed his pants... this place is trash.</text>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>I had to call corporate twice with no call back. I've spent my money @ this location on West Ave I for over 10 years. The night manager that is working there (female) is very rude, serve cold food that should be hot, even when you ask for your food to be cooked hot! She doesn't work well with customers & should be fired!!! I feel that she is prejudice against anyone who asks for food done any special way, also never ask on her shift for ice coffee with no ice, she said I couldn't have it that way! I stopped going to this location before November of 2016 & have never been back! Because of your manager there & corporate, I will never spend my hard earned money there ever again! P.S. Go to the one in Palmdale off Palmdale Blvd west side right next to am/pm gas station!😐<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>
