Excellent as always!  They have great outdoor seating, as well as some indoors now, too.  Everything I have had has been great.  The French Onion soup is amazing.  Great service,  too.< /review>

The mushroom risotto was amazing, the ribeye was underwhelming and the iles flottantes deserts was out of this world.

Two disappointments was we sat inside and clearly the service team was not used to having guests indoors as they were very loud in the way they communicated with each other....and the biggest surprise was when the server took my wine ($700 retail) and decanted it out of sight...I've  never seen that happen before.

I hate to leave a 3 star as I really love what they do here, and while it's normally my happy place my last two experiences (yesterday and 4 days ago) left me a little disappointed.</Text>

Their entree dishes look great and the ambiance is very nice!

The reason for my low rating is solely based on the escargot.... I was really excited to find RÊVE Bistro because it was the only French restaurant in the East Bay that offered them (near my house at least).

The sauce was good!!!! However, the snail tasted a little off and upset my stomach slightly.

I'd still go back but next time I would try another dish.<//Review>

Wow! I can't say enough about this place. I went here on a Wednesday (Tuesday & Wednesday 50% off bottles of wine) and asked the waitress for suggestions on wine based on our food. She was SPOT ON. The food was so amazingly done that we wanted dessert but literally was too full and ordered it to take out.

Ever wanted to experience France or love French food? Please go out and patronize this business! Every dollar is worth it.< /review>

< review>
We started with Pomme Frites as an appetizer.  Then, I had Creme of Mushroom Soup, split a Seasonal Green Salad, Cassoulet for my entree and finished with Lemon Meringue Tart. Soup was 4/5; salad 3/5; bean casserole 3/5; tart 5/5.  The Cassoulet  was a bit too thick. I like mine to be wetter.  My understanding of Cassoulet is that it is a bean casserole with duck, Andoule Sausage and a chunk of pork (salted or smoked).

For me, the best parts of the meal were the Pomme  Frites and the Lemon Meringue Tart. I find it kind strange that the best parts of a meal where the beginning and the end.< /review>

Love it wonderful classic French food.
Don't worry about dining outside it's honestly a little nicer than inside
Pricy
Home food not like super fancy food. Still fancier than the average restaurant.
The pictures don't do it justice<//Review>

<text>Went here for my Mom's birthday dinner. Very quaint, hole in the wall spot. The outside area was dressed up to look like a lit up street cafe you might find in Paris. Service was excellent. Highly, HIGHLY recommend the Beef Cheek dinner. So tender and the Chestnut Spaetzle that accompanies the Cheek was great as well. Wonderful selection of wines and for dessert, ask Sophie about the Calvados after dinner drink for dessert. Great digestive to settle all the delicious French food.< /text>< gmap_id>

<Review>It was our first time dinning here and Revé bistro did not disappoint. In fact, they went out of their way to make is feel welcomed, taken care of and satisfied. With all the health concerns surrounding our world and the economy affecting everyone in different ways,  we felt that local restaurants must be feeling the impact too so we ventured out for dinner. This gem of a French bistro served delicious onion soup, a generous  and mouth watering serving of muscles with garlic and cheese sauce, a beautifully prepared and tender steak and to top it off, dessert was crepe suzette...my oh my!...We will definitely return and bring our most discerning French food foodie friends with us next time.

Greeted and taken quickly to table. Waitress very helpful. Explained specials, answered questions. Drinks came quickly and food came HOT! There were 4 of us and there was Nothing Left on Any of our plates 😋  We all had dessert and again there was Nothing Left on Anyones plate 😋  The Only downside is the seating is close to everyone and it's a little noisy BUT we Will be returning. EXCELLENT FOOD, DRINKS AND STAFF 😁😁😁<//Review>

Replacement for Le Chevalier - inherits the true French cuisine. Frogs legs, Snails are available, but also a simpler menu cooked with élan and flair.
Steak frites, etc.

This place still has the patio forth long summer evenings. The cost makes it a special treat, but it has desserts like Ille Flotante - so that all is forgiven. The wait staff (mostly) can speak French.

Great for an unusual romantic dinner or a proposal!</Review>

<user_name>Paula Olsen</user_name><Review>We were told the restaurant had outdoor heaters and some type of enclosure, this was important as we were celebrating my mother's 91st birthday.  So right away it was clear they did not have the standard 7' tall outdoor heaters, they had a small floor unit.  Needless to say this did not put out adequate heat, to make matters worse it stopped working all together.

My mother likes a simple daiquiri: Rum, Lime Juice & Simple syrup on the rocks, however this seemed to stump the waitress and the bartender who had to each come out and say they couldn't make it because they didn't have any daiquiri mix or a blender.  The bartender finally brought a drink out that clearly did not look right, nor did it taste right!  Bartending 101 simple drink.

My mom then ordered the mussels which was touted heavily by the waitress for the delicious garlic cream sauce.  When the dish came, none of us at the table could really confirm there was any garlic in the sauce.
It was a terrible dining experience right from the beginning to the end.<//Review><UserId.>117509441490320501101< /UserId.>< Date>

We frequent Reve and always had a great meal. Special occasions, friends or just to have a seasonal special. Watch the website for seasonal specials. If it isn't fresh they don't offer it. Also, check for 50% off wines or free corkage nights.</review>

Wonderful French bistro.  The only bistro I have  found in the Bay Area that regularly offers gougierres, which are THE thing to accompany wine. They are made fresh to order and come to the table hot. We order them every time. I have been here a few times now, and everything I have ordered has been cooked to perfection. This is our go-to place for impromptu mini-celebrations or have a craving for good, authentic French food. Probably the best French restaurant in the East Bay,  at least , in my opinion.< /review>

Went to Reve Bistro last night. Beautiful patio area and decor inside. Attentive, friendly service. Absolutely delicious food, (try the heirloom tomato salad or the gazpacho) fresh ingredients, attention to detail. All in all, a terrific restaurant experience.< /Review>

Definitely a “little Paris in the ‘hood!” If you’re looking for a special night out where you want to just imagine that you are back in the City of Light, go to Reve Bistro. Such a great atmosphere with fun seating inside, especially at the bar, and outside in the heated tent. The menu changes based on the season, but you can always rely in delicious steak frites and mussels. Plus, end your meal with the chocolate mousse<//review>

The service was extremely good at this restaurant and we had a nice evening.  We have had french bistro-style food in Paris, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, etc.  I would have to say the food here was a bit below average, and my steak frites tasted strangely like a hot dog (?).  My husband agreed.  So, that was a little disappointing on a Saturday evening.</review>

Hi Laura, we did not post the earlier review and have no idea where it came from! All we can say is that Reve is our favorite restaurant in the East Bay. From the well-prepared, authentic French bistro food, to the ambiance, to the personalized service from the front of the house and wait staff, everything at Reve hits on all cylinders. Looking forward to our next dinner with you.</text>

< Review>
Excellent new venue for Lafayette!

I remember when the space was occupied by Levy's bagels i think back in the early 90s

Food and service is pretty traditional bistro fare

Highly recommend the charcuterie platter and the veal sweet breads

Service was even and competent

Only complaint would be the tight quarters and the rocking table which they eventually fixed< /Review>

I went for the first time to Rêve Bistrot with a group of friends and we had a fabulous time there. From far, I had some of the best food in the Bay Area.
It’s a place to go with friends/family or for a romantic dinner ... and I think I’ll go back for a romantic dinner with my husband.< /text>

Our favorite French restaurant in the East Bay. Food and service is always outstanding.  The traditional food such as Coq au Vin, Cassoulet and the like are the best. They also have specials each week based on seasonal availability. We just has fresh locally caught salmon. Yum.< /Text>

Gougeres were light and tender but slightly salty that dimished the cheese flavor. Chilled tomato soup was too acidic and salty. Some lobster pieces were overcooked in the lobster salad and the Coq au Vin was tasteless. No red wine sauce soaked into the mushrooms abd were tasteless, especially how mushrooms absorb flavor, lardons were practically non-existent and the ones I found were tastless and the tagliatelle was coated in fat and were greasy. When I tried to explain the problems I had with the Coq au Vin, he insisted there was a red wine sauce in the dish when there was no evidence it ever existed on my plate. Had high hopes due to reviews on Check Please Bay area but was extremely disappointed.😞<//Review>

<text>For me a pizza regardless of toppings has to have a great tasting crust with right amount of cheese.  The Pizza oven hits the ratio out of the park. So so good.<//text>< Pics>

The restuarant is clearly popular as we did have to wait a little - it would appear you have more chance if you are happy to go inside which we did. Good range of pizzas that are freshly cooked and not too filling as some can be.<//Review>

This is a business park eatery that serves sandwich es, pizza and pasta.  The food is OK, think of it as fast food Italian.  Sandwich and full pizza are made to order.  Pizza by the slice and pasta is premade and reheated.< /Review>

Nice little place. I ordered pizza. It was good but not great. I'm  a former restaurant owner for more than 3 decades.  They need to make the dough not so sweet and hopefully make it themselves. I will  go there again, this time for their subs.<//text>

Sandwhiches are really good, my favorite is the turkey, ham, and avocado. I love their veggie soup!!! Pizza is average but they do sell the Heart shaped one for valentin's Day, though its really cute i think its overpriced since you get a lot less slices.</review>

All in all, their pizzas were delicious and worth it at a reasonable price. Also, the ambiance was clean and smell great. As a satisfied customer, rating you a 5-stars was the best thing to do. Others must come! You won't be disappointed!<//Review>< name>

< Review>
So we ate it, because I spend almost $30 bucks for it. I just can’t figure out why their ratings are so high. It looks like good thin pizza but it’s not, the only thing with good flavor on the pizza was the sausage. The other items were I think some sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni (which I couldn’t taste), mushrooms and spinach. I did ask for well done, but not burnt. Which I assume effect the taste a lot. All in all Costco supreme pizza is way better tasting, bigger and it’s affordable. We won’t be going back to this place, try and fail. Only reason i picked this place was because Costco was closed and this place was close to where I was and the ratings were high. I assume there is much better “fancy” pizza out there though. (Missing the east coast today, where pretty much all pizza is freakin awesome.)<//Review>

< Review>
We decided to try this place because it’s close to home and the reviews were great. Ordered a large cheese and pepperoni pizza. The dough was super thin like a piece of paper and the crust was burnt. The flavor was bland and not what we expected. For the first time my kids threw away their pizza. Very disappointed.</Review>

<Text>My partner and I always make a stop by Fist of Flour Doughjo for their awesome pizzas: New York style thin crust and fresh ingredients. They also have ice cream. Staff is friendly; this no frills down home pizza joint is a local Oakland spot we love to support.< /Text>< pictures>

Great location with main street parking it side streets, fast service, and amazingly creative and delicious pizza! Must try Blueberry Hill - a surprising combo that is executed well, with quality ingredients i was able to enjoy even days later, by toasting the leftovers!< /review>

<Review>Lots of people will love this place. Handmade, fresh ingredients, and you can buy by the slice. The crust is delightful (thin style). Geared for take out. Some counter space and stools. Not for classic American style pizza buffs.< /Review>< pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Great local pizza place. They have a few really out of the blue options (like the blueberry pizza). You can order over the phone and pick up in-store or have it delivered with door dash or caviar (I can't remember which). The staff is amazing, happy, and quick to smile. Also, their house made spicy ranch is to die for. I'm pretty sure they cater too (talk about a party).<//Text>< name>

Super delicious pizza. Salads are great too! Not the best for leftovers though. The crust is pretty thin. Still awesome though. Love the fresh basil and the pepper flakes are super bright red. Great quality of ingredients.< /review>

Don't know how people can call this pizza. It's just flat bread with cheese with zero sauce. They should do a blind taste test with the competitions pizza and theirs and ask themselves what makes them think they can sell what they do.<//Text>

<text>Very good wood-fired pizza. Blueberry Hill is a great option here. The only reason we give it 4 out of 5 is because it's not a very large pizza for the price. Definitely worth trying, though.< /text>< Pics>

I'm not quite sure what their secret is, but it's working.  Their crust is on the thinner side, the sauce has a fresh flavor and their cheese is.. I mean, come on, cheese is one of the best things ever and this cheese is really good cheese...so bonus points. They also make one heck of a meatball sub.</Text>

<Review>This pizza is bomb! Unique specials made from scratch with fresh ingredients. My personal fave is the Protesto... it has sliced potatoes and pesto. Not gonna lie, the first time I ate there, I had almost an entire large by myself. They have lunch specials that are reasonably priced and the staff is super nice. They may actually like their jobs.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Can't order from them because Caviar won't deliver to our area despite be 3X closer to the store than places they will deliver to.  I guess Caviar can't be bothered to serve East Oakland.  Can't imagine why.  .. when things change I'll change my review.<//review>

High quality pizza.  You can get pizza by the pie or slice for a very reasonable price.  They have unique topping combinations that seems very tasty.  I got the classico and it was very good.< /Text>

I'm lucky to have this in our neighborhood, great pizza that is comparable to Cheeseboard or Arizmendi. The classic pizza is perfect, as is the potato pizza. Fresh basil always tops pizzas and make them smell oh-so amazing!<//Review>

Yes 100% to this thin and crispy crust. Walked in for some cheese pizza and I walked out with a new obsession. 4 stars instead of 5 because I'm a Coke/Pepsi/cola fan and not big on the fruity flavor (Pelligrino?) drinks.< /Review>

<Name>Molly Reisman</Name><review>Plus: Good pizza
Minus: poor customer service. We called ahead to see when they closed and whether it was ok to come in close to closing. They were unfriendly and though they close at 9pm on Saturday night (what??!), your order needs to be in by 8:30. The place was FREEZING, mean, there is a crazy air conditioning vortex where the customers wait, and they only have a few counters stools--no tables, so we ate outside by the car.

Ehh. It's probably better during the day...< /review><user_id>116840382666827183065< /user_id>< rating>

Yay something other than Redboy Pizza. I don't really care for Redboy pizza, except that they deliver, but Fist of Flour taste so much better. They don't deliver, but they just recently opened. I'm hoping that they will work out their delivery system soon. I ordered a pizza over the phone, and it was made really quick. Almost too quick. By the time I got home, the pizza was slightly cold. Still tasted good, but it would be nice to know what the warm fresh pizza from the oven at Fist of Flour taste like. I'm hoping they'll figure out a way to keep the pizzas tasting really fresh with that gooey melted cheese thing that I love about fresh out of the oven pizza.

I do like how they ask if you want fresh basil sprinkled on your pizza. Oh yes please! Always.< /Review>

Mike does his best to keep this track safe and fun to ride. Sometimes the wind makes it hard for beginning riders - and be sure to have bug spray! Cover yourself before you even get out of the truck because the bugs are crazy, but only sometimes, apparently they can't fly in the wind and they don't like weather that's too hot or cold. The hamburgers are surprisingly good. Overall a great place.<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>I have to say this is the cleanest Metro store I’ve ever walked into. With that said I was greeted immediately with a hello and how may I help you, the young man was Luis. I told him I’m fun out of town and my phone broke. He was so sympathetic right away and asked if he could enter my account to help me. After a little minute he assisted me in getting a great new phone at a discount and he also put on my glass protector and case. Then he told me I get a free gift, accessory. I of course chose a headset.
When I can in to the place I was upset, but somehow this guy made my day and saved me some  money. I thought it’s cool specially during these times to get something free too. Anyhow love you metro. And if I’m ever in town again, this is my go to metro.</Review>< pictures>

I've been here a few times and each time it's been the best experience I've had at any phone place. I would like to give extra thanks to Kevin I believe it is whose helped me nearly each time I've been here. He's so friendly and has a great attitude, and made me smile each time.  Makes me feel welcome and not a bother. I had quite a few questions once and he was very patient and took care of everything with a outstanding customer service. I work retail so I understand how hard it can be sometimes. I think the best employees are here. I ride my bike around and this one is not exactly in the easiest ride to get to and from but given the exceptional customer service I like to come here when i have a question or just need to pay my phone bill. Keep up the good work and customer service. Thank u.< /text>

Thank you Kash, Reyna and Merks for the great help you all provided. Thank you for helping us chose the phones to port our number to. You are an amazing store and that's why we drove past all the other locations to come to you. Also thank you for the extra work you put in to get our numbers for us.
see you soon<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I have been a Metro customer since 2006. Before phones were considered smart and their prime use was to make phone calls. We never have problems with service or dropping calls. (although we will now, since I put it into the universe) My only gripe ever, has been their customer service. However, that has changed dramatically within the company. The best workers are at this location. The people here are always so friendly and take their time working with you. They are very knowledgeable about the phones and service plans. I have closer stores to me, yet I specifically drive to this location because of the people.
I adore Reyna. She is always so helpful and friendly! I had a problem with my account and she got on the phone with customer service and SHE had to explain to them what to do and what they were doing wrong, Good Job Reyna and thank you!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Came in to change service providers. Shawn was so helpfull and patient to get our numbers brought over to Metro. The young girl that was there was so nice she gave us 2 cases for our phones and gave us a discount on the glass protectors for the screen. They helped us put all of our information back on our new phones. This  is truly a great location and we chose the right people to help us. Than kyou for everything Metro by Tmobile Rancho Cucamonga.< /Review>

Terrible. As soon as I walked in the store it smelled like the employees just smoked marijuana recently in the back of the store and when I asked for a specific phone they didn't have it but another model, so I decided to take that one instead only for them to tell me they didn't have that one either. Metro needs to do something about that store. The professionalism in there is unbearable. I just read the other reviews as well. No it's not the public, it's the employees smoking. There was no one else but myself in there.< /review>

<Text>I highly recommend this location! I won't go anywhere else, these guys are awesome, so friendly and helpful.
I am so happy I switched from Sprint to MetroPCS. Now I actually get 4G LTE full bars on my Galaxy S5, I was only getting 3G with 2 to 3 bars with Sprint and when I complained (after spending that much money on a phone) they could not care less as long as they got my $100 a month!!!
These guys actually care and made it so easy for me.
I only pay $55 a month now with unlimited everything and no contract. And I'm loving it!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Best service EVER from a MetroPCs store. I went in here cause I bought a defective phone in Arizona. These people here were so nice and they went above and beyond to help me. In fact they gave me the BEST service and GREATEST deal. Even tho they didn't have to. I respect them AND RECOMMEND this location, MetroPCS Rancho Cuamonga is the BEST on Arrow rt and Archibald.< /Review>

Worst metro around. the lady helping us was uninformed and misleading, not only did they charge us twice for our activation but we pushed through the terms of everything as she sped through everything and hurrying us to sign. We called the company about being charged twice only to be hung up on. We were forced to call corporate and even then it took a week to get our money refunded. We will never go there or to any other  metro again.<//review>

This is my favorite location to come to. Everyone here is so nice and helpful. I'm writing because, unfortunately, I witnessed appalling behavior and verbal abuse from a customer during my last visit where I upgraded my daughters phone. People are ridiculous! Honestly, they are lucky the employee didn't call the cops...shoot I almost called the cops! Instead they handled it with grace and did their job the best they could under the circumstances.
I read the other reviews, and I'm literally shocked about what some people are saying, these people are far from rude. If anything I have to commend them for putting up with entitled, low lives everyday just because they are on the other side of the counter and wouldn't bend over backwards and possibly lose their job for them. BTW my 11 yr old daughter witnessed this grown man throw a fit and spit imbecile insults at 20 yr olds as well.</Text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>MetroPCS is a rapidly growing company. I have had their service for over 3 years, it's getting to be the best in my opinion for where I live. Anyhow, I just found the latest open MetroPCS store. This Metro PCS is about an hour from my house, but the other night when I needed a store at 8:30pm, this was the only store that was open, In fact when I googled  MetroPCS stores open, ONLY this location showed up in the entire United States. So I drove to 9755 Arrow rt, Rancho Cucamonga, CA. 91730 to the MetroPCS store. This place is so clean and nice, OMG the inside of the stoer smells so fresh and nice, the people greet you with “hi welcome, how are you doing”? WOW I was amazed, the are open the latest for MetroPCS and they are so nice. So I asked to make a payment and they did it, but before doing that the guy mentioned their promotions to me, so I added another line for only $30 a month. So I am so pleased this location is the latest opened metropcs and they are so nice, on top of that they are so informing. Love you all here.
By the way, they are open unitl 9pm....WOWZERS< /review>< Pictures>

Robert Tinker is a bad mouth person, he is rude and lies. Therefore your "Slander" of this business is not appreciated. You were given FREE service by us, now accept that you are being in the wrong. Also STOP with the name calling, harassment and other rude gestures you have made, you have even VERBALLY threatened staff at this location. You will be reported if you keep it up. Calling people idiots and liars is NOT acceptable.<//Text>

The food itself was delicious, however an item was forgotten and once we realized we called to ask if we could pick it up. Unfortunately no one answered the call after spending nearly half an hour trying to call the bistro. I would like to give 5 stars, but for the price of the garlic parmesan fries it is very unfortunate to not even get an answered phone call. Great food, poor service.<//review>

Very pleasant surprise!!! Excellent Burgers and Fries. Beer was ice cold severed in chilled glasses. Decent size menu, cool vibe and A/C was rocking. Staff was very personable, friendly and helpful. Super cool that they have a different special each weekday (see attached photo of current specials).  I even saw a discount given to a senior citizen. AWESOME. We were told that they have a $3.00 Beer Special during Fresno State Football games. I will definitely be going back again!!! 🍔🍟🍺< /text>

I don't care how good the food is. The service I received was so disrespectful and particularly egregious to the disabled that I will never go to this place again. I specifically called ahead to ask for curbside service which they agreed to.  Once I arrived they were argumentative and said I hadn't called and continued to argue with me. In a time where you should be grateful for individuals supporting local businesses, disrespecting the disabled is bad business. I hope the owner sees this review and educates the employees on customer service and being kind and supportive to individuals who face challenges every day of their lives.< /Text>

Decent hole in the wall burger place. First time I came here I had one of the best veggie burgers I had in awhile today I got the cheeseburger and my boyfriend got the big bulldog and we couldn’t forget the garlic fries with EXTRA garlic of course! They have a little bit of something for everyone and the 10% student discount isn’t bad either. It’s not the best burger I’ve had in my life but the garlic fries keep me coming back for more. PS my boyfriend says there was a weird smell when he walked into the place and that for some reason the tables are annoyingly sticky. But for him it’s still the best burger he’s had in town.< /Text>

We tried 3 different burgers and 2 different fries. Definately one of the best burgers I’ve ever had. The pastrami is crispy (love) and my personal favorite was the Bacon blue, oh my! Recommend highly, that buttery brioche bun is to die for! Can’t wait to order again!< /text>

<text>We like supporting local eateries over the chains and have eaten at the Bulldog Burger Bistro for a few years now. I've never been disappointed until today. Maybe it was because of all the COVID-19 shutdowns and the way they have to go about business but today was just disappointing. We'll still give them another try because they have been so good in the past but today just wasn't their day.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><rating>3<//rating><user_name>Kevin Deisher<//user_name></record>

Yum! I give a lot of love to a place that takes my order seriously, especially one that has a great burger selection to begin with. A patty medium-rare? No problem. Extra crispy fries? You got it. That kind of service goes a long way toward getting my repeat business. Try the mini-Bulldog burger, which includes bacon and pastrami. Sorry, but vegan options are pretty limited -- another one of my biggest criteria!<//review>

< review>
This location is a very good burger place that has an understated appearance. Small, simple, and with minimal decor but with better food than its looks would suggest. With plain brown commercial paper towel rolls for napkins and concrete floors the only real downside of this location is how it presents itself. The burgers and onion rings at this place are very good and they offer a small number of beers on tap. The price is reasonable when one considers the quality and proportions on offer. Given how easy it is to overlook I would consider this location something of a hidden gem, although the local students probably know it well. Anyone looking for burgers in the area should consider giving it a try.</review>

<Review>I ordered a steak salad which said it had brisket on it. I asked the guy if it was brisket or steak. He said brisket so I assumed it would be tender, you know, like brisket. It was not. I couldn't chew a single piece I bit into. So I asked them to take it off and just give me a burger on it. I also asked for new onion straws because the ones I got on top were soggy, not a bit crispy. It came back with crispy onions, but instead of a burger they had cooked up hamburger meat in crumbles. But whatever, that was fine, just kind of dry. The ranch dressing was delicious, that was the best part. We also ordered the onion rings because they get rave reviews. I thought they tasted like donuts. Not bad, but I definitely wouldn't order them again. And my friend was half done with her salad when she found a large wadded up piece of plastic wrap in it. All in all, not a good experience. Don't think we'll be going back.</Review><Date>1535637721920<//Date>< Resp>

<text>I keep coming back for the Baby Bulldog burger. It's one of the best pastrami burgers I've ever had. The regular Bulldog burger is to much for me but if you have a big appetite I recommend it. Everything I've had at the BBB has been hot fresh and delicious.< /text>< Gmap_id>

I had an after hours meeting with about 30 of my employees. I made arrangements with The Bulldog 1 week in advance for 3 of their Party Platters with Modifications - 25 Sliders and 2 dozen wings for each platter. On the day I was to pick it up, I had to modify a few more details for vegetarian options as well. I called the restaurant and made the adjustments without any issues. I arrived for my order and only had to wait for a few minutes to receive a total of 85 Sliders, 6 dozen wings, a huge tray of condiments, sliced tomato, and lettuce and the vegetarian meals all FRESH!!! Needless to say I was beyond impressed with the Quality, Efficiency, and Image displayed by the employees. My team loved the food too. Will definitely be back for more. TO THE BULLDOG!!!</Text>

Great service. Excellent food, made pretty fast. I had the best grilled chicken sandwich ever. French fries are crispy and seasoned just right. I don’t live here, but will definitely be back when I’m visiting</Text>

< Review>
Great food and delicious sauces! Everything on their menu is absolutely worth getting. They do have a rather large meal so understand you get what you pay for.
Hands down one of the best burger places in the entire Fresno and Clovis area! Not to mention that they are located in a very public area and right next to it Fresno State but it is worth the wait!<//Review>

One of the best burgers I've ever had. 9/10

Be prepared to spend $25+ for two people. A little pricey but quality ingredients, and good sized burger. DEFINITELY worth a try! New owner is very polite and very eager to help. They earned my business.</review>

<Review>Quite literally anything I've had on their menu was delicious, and their sriracha aioli makes each item more enjoyable. One order of fries can feed a three people easily and is dirt cheap for how good they are. Always offered me a student discount, friendly people!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Great unique flavors in all their one of a kind burgers!  Hand made onion rings with their specially made dipping sauces from their own private recipes, the BBQ  sauce might just be the best I've ever had!  Sweet with a bit of a bite!  The Philly cheese steak loaded fries are a must!<//Text>

<Text>Usually have great service, great food, and great atmosphere. Last night I ordered my usual big bulldog burger and was looking forward to it as it was my last night in Fresno after 6 years. The cashier/waitress informed us that it was her first night so we gave her benefit of the doubt and we were patient. Upon ordering and asking "can I get a..." I was hit with a joking no. Later when asking can I get a side of ranch the new employee jokingly in poor taste replied no again. When we finally recieved our food i had been given a cowboy burger. I love this place but it seems that without the normal employees in the kitchen things were running different.<//Text></record>

MY OPINION:
***Will recommend***
°but won't be going back
°just not MY food choice
My honest opinion is that I don't like the bread. Wish they had more bread options.
EDITED: I will be looking forward coming back with my Family once you get better bread☺<//Review>

It's super small inside and very cramped.. If it was busy? It would be horribly uncomfortable... The design is thrown together.. The front counter is "thrown together", paint is trashy.

They take pride and pay attention to their food.. You can watch that.. Food is good.. I would be back..</Review>< name>

One of the best burger places I have been too. These guys really got it down, perfect customer service learned our names while we were there, and clean restrooms. Good food and great price point. Burger fries and beer for 10 is hard to beat.<//text>

A friend and I ate there before the Fresno State football game.  She had a pastrami sandwich and I had a chicken wrap.  I also had fries.  Everything was excellent and generous servings.  In fact, I had to take half to go.  I highly recommend it.</text>

Food is pretty good, generous on the fries, nice service. The only reason why I'm not giving a 5 is because the chairs and stools are really uncomfortable. They're metal. Place wasn't all that clean.<//Text>

I've dined in and ordered online. Burgers I've had have been good both times, but the fries aren't much. But if I had to chose I'd rather dine in, the burgers taste a lot fresher.< /review>

<Review>Food and wait server were fantastic but it was all the other non food things that turns me off of this place.

1. They share a wall with a nail saloon, the smell was over powering inside the bistro and had to move outside. They only had 2 table with 3 chairs at each.

2. To many tables inside leaves no room to walk around comfortably. There weren't too many people inside but if it was busy, forget about it.

3. Drinks served in a 'to-go' cup with wait service and the server had take your cup for refills since the drinks were behind the counter.

4. Wasteful quantity of food; there were 2 of us and ordered the only size basket of fries. It was 3 lbs of fries! we couldn't even finish 1/2 of it; waste of money and food! I don't know about their other items but it is served a la carte so you if you want a side with your sandwich you have no choice in what size you get.

You won't be disappointed with the hamburgers as they were delicious.< /Review><UserId.>112697252323988992749< /UserId.><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

Only one item was "good" that item was the fries. The burger itself was really undercooked, I myself didn't finish it in fear of getting sick. A little pink is okay, a lot is not. Another customer also had an issue, I overheard her as I was leaving. Pricing is a little too much $10.40 for the meal. Next time I am craving a burger I will just head over too Dog House! Date of visit 1/26/16. Off to a bad start bulldog burger bistro.</Text>

<Text>Has to be the worst service and cleanliness in Fresno. The cashier was a young girl who was impatient with my questions about the doggy style fries and I ultimately felt bad for asking the question as she was rude so I settled for whatever they gave me. Overpriced as they are, I ended up spending my earned money on a meal I really didn't want because of the rudeness of the young (probably stoned off pot) cashier. The bathroom is disgusting. I'll go to McDonalds next time for better service.  On a high note, the gentleman who gave me my food was very nice and almost made up the slack for his counterpart at the register. Can't see myself going back for a while.< /Text><gmapID>0x80945d1079d6f351:0xca9db072c5cde691</gmapID>< Rating>

Great burgers, cost is high like 10 bucks for just the burger. But if you want a great burger and willing to pay like 14 bucks for a combo it's good.< /Review>

< Review>
In the world of burger mathematics lies the formula to the recipe of a place where the burger=B is to the power of 3, or scientifically speaking B cubed, or B^3, lets not forget mathematically explained 1(BxBxB) =(hence) Bulldog Burger Bistro. This my lady's and gentlemen is the burgers of all burger places. Yes, crowded into the Bulldog Plaza shopping mall hides the holly cow cannoli, the grand finally of the finales. This is no ordinary place though, fight your way through the tight parking space and this is where you'd find The King of Burger King, it's where he hangs out when he's not shooting for BK commercials. Every now and then Ronald from McDonald's comes in to get a real burger when he's "really" hungry after eating his .25 lbs burger, and In and Out came in and out of this place before they became "In and Out," it truly is like Carl before giving birth to Carl Junior. This my friends is where Rally's checkered out and brought burgers into Eureka! Now visually speaking they aren't there yet, they're right where those above where before they became how they've become, before visual appeals were more important than the food that's become the dodo of the poopoo. Please don't let the visual appeal fool you though, the place is currently going through some renovations, with that set aside, this is how good the burgers are at this place. It is awesomely amazing!, they definitely crossed their t(s) and dotted their i(s) when it came to the food. So if you want to stimulate and highly intensify your frontal operculum and the anterior insula(this is part of your brain people), then I challenge you to come to this place where you'll find each characters above dancing together in harmony to something they can all enjoy. You too can dance in harmony and sing Kumbaya so what are you waiting for? Go-on, C'mon now... Carry on...</Review>

<Review>The food isnt good, it tastes like McDonald's . Plus too expensive for the low quality  food they serve. It doesn't even fill you up either , their portions are small. The food wasnt cooked all the way . They take forever to clean up tables. An to make it worse the room is tiny with no room to maneuver  around. I was very dissapointed., McDonald's isn't as bad as this place. Just Save your money< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I will NOT be coming back here again ! I saw a cockroach coming from the kitchen as my food was coming out and i told the owner who   was on cashier but he refused to do anything about it ! He was very rude and disrespectful ! definitely not a place to take your family or yourself ! food very bland and GROSS by the way!!!</review>

I do not generally write reviews but I felt compelled to write this review after my recent visit to American Freight. I came across this store online while looking for clothing racks for my clothing business.. I dealt with the manager Eric who was so helpful and friendly. Although I was only looking for clothing racks,, I ended up looking around the entire store as the inventory they carry was just very impressive. They have a great selection of very good quality furniture pieces and appliances at some exceptional prices. I recently purchased a sofa set elsewhere and only wish I had visited American Freight first as I would have definitely purchased from them and wish I had. I am in the market for a new bedroom set and found one that I just loved. The quality and design seem superb and the pricing is much lower than similar sets I have looked at elsewhere. Eric and the other staff were all extremely helpful and attentive and took the time to answer all of my many questions. This place is awesome and I highly recommend that you check it out. Customer service is excellent and they really do have some very nice furniture and appliances at some really good prices. Highly recommend.</review>

Had a great experience with Eric that works here.

I bought a gas dryer here and after they delivered it we hooked it up and it was leaking gas. So I went back to the store and spoke to Eric and without hesitation he gave me a better dyer (that was more expensive) than the original one, BUT matched the price of the original one! So I got a better dryer for the same price as the original. He also refunded me the delivery fee. Awesome customer service thank you so much Eric!</text>

<review>Terrible experience with American Freight. Purchased a washer from the Hayward location and first washer was defected. It started leaking water EVERYWHERE. Got in contact with the manager and we purchased a newer model.

Delivery people came to deliver but was missing parts and had to take washer back. Got ANOTHER washer delivered and this time, washer left clothes soaking wet and rattled so loud like it was having a seizure.

I thought I put too much clothes in but only put a couple delicates and regulars clothes (around 7 pieces of clothing) and it still shook up super loudly like it was having a seizure. I was being patient and tried all methods and even contacted GE Appliance. They only pushed me away saying that "washers are suppose to do that".

I wanted to get it replaced but with a different type of washer, only to find that the entire store only has returned washers (used), opened washers (out of the box) and a limited amount of washers that were not to our liking.

I continued to contact Eric (manager) and told him the washer situation and that I wanted a refund because this is the 3rd washer that has been delivered to our house. He stated that he will get it replaced with the same model that is still in the box and if this new washer does not work, we can contact him and we will get a refund. He never gave us a time limit on when we can contact him back if washer is defected and I asked him multiple times if he can give some sort of confirmation that we can get a refund if the new washer is defected and he said "no, a phone call is fine and I will know".

New washer came in and we were surprised that it was working efficiently, on some days. Again, we place 7 pieces of clothing and the washer would shake violently as if it was having a seizure. It left my clothes soaking wet again. I tried being patient and used all methods to wash my clothes, but sadly, THIS WASHER HAS OCCASIONAL SEIZURES AND IS BIPOLAR.

I tried testing out the washer for a good month and I couldn't deal with it anymore. I DONT WANT TO COME HOME TO SOAKING WET CLOTHES AND HAVING TO STAND OVER THE WASHER FOR 45 MINUTES TO SEE IF IT WILL WASH OR NOT.

I called the Hayward store once again only to hear from Eric that he can't refund my money back because it has been too long. I asked when would it have been a good time to have called back to issue a refund and he said "24 hrs". How do you expect me to get a diagnosis of the washer in just 24 hrs of delivering it? Eric proceeded to push me away and told me to contact GE appliance manufacturer. I called them before and they DO NOT HELP.
I just want a refund so I can wash my clothes again.

They sell refurbished washers to customers. Washers are not that cheap compared to legitimate stores like Best Buy, Lowes or Home Depot. You are paying more for a defected washer. Customer service was terrible and they will not hold responsibility over their defected washers. Delivery was not handled efficiently and had missing parts. DON'T PURCHASE FROM AMERICAN FREIGHT. IT'S CHEAPER TO PURCHASE GUARANTEED EFFICIENT WASHERS FROM BEST BUY, LOWES. OR HOME DEPOT.< /review>< GmapID>

I drove 30 minutes to get there after verifying and reserving the unit I wanted, only to find out they loaded the wrong machine on my truck. I had to make a return trip the next day to exchange. They did refind $75 bucks so all and all they recovered from a bad start.< /text>< pictures>

As if 2020 was not already rough enough, imagine accidentally smashing your father-in-law's glass cooktop while he was out of the house for a few days! Imagine trying to replace it before he gets home and finding out that none of the big do-it-all shops carry any appliances on-hand so it will be 2-3 weeks before you can get a replacement! Now enter the wonderful people of American Freight at the Hayward store. Eric and Kody - huge shout out for going the extra mile to save my butt! Everyone was super helpful and they had appliances ON SITE that I could take home that day!! Huge Win! Thanks!!!<//Text>

When they brought the refrigerator finally, they wouldn’t hook it up, because they said the water hookup to the refrigerator would not cut off. They assured me that they would come back to hook-up the refrigerator when I got it fixed. They did not haul away the old refrigerator. They also assured me that they would pick-up the old refrigerator When they come to hookup the new one.

I tested the water cutoff valve the next day, and it was working fine. They have not returned to hookup the new refrigerator, nor take the old one. It has been months and they continue to direct me to call the main distribution center, and any other number that they should be calling themselves. They never call back, though they say they will.

The Hayward American Freight customer service is terrible. The manager Eric has let this drag-out for multiple months without any follow-through. Come hook-up my new refrigerator, and take the old. This is what I paid for. I would not suggest anyone buy from the Hayward,ca store. If I could give less than one star, for my experience and the neglect of the management at this location, I would.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>Beware when purchasing appliances from here, particularly a refrigerator.  If the product doesnt have the original serial/model label, sears service reps wont service the appliance.  We specifically asked about the missing tag and the manager told us there would be no problems because there is a tag on the outside. Purchased our fridge in june, delivered in July, stopped cooling in August, now its October and fridge still hasnt been serviced (3 calls canceled by sears) and now working.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<review>If I could give it negative stars I would! The worst customer service and full of lies. Bought a fridge And warranty July 2020. Was told that if it ever was unrepairable I would get a refund for the full (undiscounted) price and be able to purchase from a sears store, well I got the fridge home, plugged it in and left for 2 days. Came home to a non, never working fridge. Called the warranty company they couldn’t come out until August 10th! Came out, didn’t have the right part, ordered part that didn’t arrive on time had to reschedule the second repair appt for when part was here, fridge was called unrepairable aug. 22 by warranty repairman. After 100+hours on the phone to warranty company, sears and American freight, I’m told I can only purchase a replacement from American freight and will have to re pay for delivery and only get a voucher for the amount I paid. This was just told to me as of October 13th!
DO NOT BUY FROM HERE! Such bs and the worst customer service ever</review>< pictures>

We ordered a fridge and stove from this store and after getting a confirmation email, only the stove got delivered (a week later) We called and it turned out the fridge was out of stock. So we ordered a new one. It has been a week and still no call setting up a delivery even though the email said they would call within 24 hours of purchase. We called the store and they hung up on us twice and then the third time they said the manager was going to call us back. We waited 3 hours and no call. So we called again. We sat on hold for 20 min because the associate had to talk to his manager. Finally they said they will deliver in 2 days. I usually give people the benefit of the doubt but we are living out of a cooler and I’m honestly going insane.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Sears is on a losing battle with mail order company. Once an American icons .Sear* catalog you can find house to almost everything there.  Craftsman brand already sold. Kenmore next.  Let's keep America great again shop Sears .  Don't let Sears slowly disappeared in the map. k Mart almost gone already.  Both are my favorite place to shop.<//text>

edit: on 5/31/20 I received a voicemail from eric offering a partial refund (10% + delivery fee) in exchange for editing this negative review.

we agreed for them to mail the check. a month later I haven't received any check. I've called 4 times and provided messages at the store every weekend since, no response as of 6/30/20.

original review:
________________________________________________
pretty bad customer service, good prices. tips:

1) be prepared to bug folks in the store if you need anything. don't call them or assume there will be follow up outside of the store.
2) don't purchase the warranty, it's useless + they will push you into using the manufacturer's one anyways.
3) call to confirm the day of delivery, since the confirmation calls don't actually happen.
4) keep $15 in cash for haul aways, the store may tell you it's covered but it is not.

5/11: ordered fridge. they promised a confirmation call, but didn't get one for the delivery date of 5/15. had to proactively bug the store to confirm that I should stay home the day of.

5/15: delivery folks made me cough $15 for the haul away, despite documentation that stated it was covered. also bent the frame of the fridge while delivering. also tried to re-use my water line despite having paid for a new one. after splashing water everywhere, they left when I pointed out that the water dispenser wasn't actually working since a water filter was not included.

5/16: condenser fan sounds like it's hitting plastic, so it's obvious the fridge is a lemon. tried calling for help, but the woman who handles phone calls said they can't help unless I paid for their warranty upfront, despite the fact that I didn't get a chance to sign off on the unit.

5/17: went into the store for help + to show them a video of the fan. eric told me he applied a warranty to the unit and that a tech would reach out to help. great service in the store.

5/17-5/21: tried to get follow up regarding the technician, even got an email from david saying that it would happen. after calling 20+ times and failing to get in touch with anyone, I didn't get any help.

5/21: tried to schedule directly online using the sears warranty eric said he gave me - but it wasn't actually applied. the online agent told me to go to the manufacturer, which I was able to make an appointment for.

5/27: the manufacturer technician fixed fan issue + water line in 20 minutes. still no follow through from the folks in the store.<//Text>

Was sincerely impressed by Davidson Uji, an employee at the Sears Outlet store in Hayward. First, to be carrying a ladder (almost twice his size and height) across the store and up many stairs with "style and grace" --

The, secondly, to then provide great customer service when ringing up our purchase. He took time and made sure we were able to accomplish our desire to use our rewards.

He was a breathe of fresh air and you should be pleased to have him as a member of your team. Good job, Davidson!< /Text>

I bought really good GE refrigerator that had slight damage behind the handle but still looked cute! I paid to have it delivered and installed on a Wednesday. The lady that sold it to me said to call tuesday morning to get a 2 hour window. I called at 8am and phone rang for 30min before I hung up. Then i called again at 10am and again no answer. Then again at 12 and 2  and then at 4pm and finally someone answere . The lady that answered could not give me a 2 hour or a time at all! She just said my fridge would be coming after 1pm. I get a call at 4pm on the day of my delivery to say that my delivery will not be happening because the driver called in sick and no one knew until 3pm. They rescheduled my delivery for Saturday and and again the same thing happened!!! I went to the store with an attitude and was told to talk to David. I was ready to go off on him and he was calm and ready to take it. I told him about my frustration and he said let's fix it. He explained that the manager had the keys to the truck but he was willing to do whatever it took to get me my fridge. He came up with plan to load it in my truck, meet me at my house and install it . David and Jerry showed up to my house at just about the same time I got there with a dolly in hand. They pulled the fridge off my truck got it the house and installed it . Had it not been for David I would be asking for full refund!!! Now I'm actually thinking about going back to make another purchase because of David!!!</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

< Review>
Worst customer service.  I purchased a stackable washer/dryer online 1/30/20.  They left me a VM same day about setting up the delivery.  Good luck getting ANYONE to answer the phone over there. The main store number rings unanswered or has a busy tone.  The lady who called me to set up the delivery left her cell #, but she doesn’t answer her phone either.

I called the Sears Outlet customer service line on 2/6/20, and THEY couldn’t get through to the store either.  Customer service guy said that he sent the store manager an email to respond to me...still no response.  Unacceptable that I paid for this item a week ago and they still haven’t followed up about delivery.

***update***

After scrolling down through the google reviews,  I was able to find an email for the assistant store manager.  I sent him an email, but after 5 hours, I still didn’t get a reply.  After scrolling through reviews again, I found a district manager’s email address.  He had a district manager-in-training reach out to me within 30 mins of my email and they got my delivery set up for this Monday, 2/10/20.

I appreciate the district manager’s fast response, but I shouldn’t have had to go through the lengths that I did to get my appliance. Senior management needs to coach that store’s team on customer service.< /Review>

The only reason I'm leaving a 5-star review and not a 1/2 star review is because of DAVID MARTINEZ.

The SEARS technicians left my washer/dryer halfway installed and non-operational after they informed me I was missing a power cable.

I bought the part the same day, and they still made me wait until the following week before someone would complete the installation.

The following week, they did not call or show; we had to call and reschedule again for the end of the week.

The end of the week came and they promised us they would install the unit Monday of the next week. We were going to be three weeks past original installation date when David Martinez took control.

Mr. Martinez provided me with his personal cell phone number and made it a point to CALL ME (I did not once call him) for updates until the unit was installed, and he even called the day after to follow up.

I might not ever buy another appliance from SEARS again after this grueling and painstaking experience, but if I had to, I would personally ask for David Martinez by first and last name.

Thanks again, David< /review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>I ordered a Shark vacuum from this store and didn't get it. This normally wouldn't be a huge deal, but it felt impossible to get refunded. I called the store over the past few weeks and they told me they're going to handle it and get back to me, but never called back. After calling again today (4th or 5th time) I was told that they'd mailed out a check, but I was never emailed or called stating that that this was mailed out, didn't get anything in writing. Complete lack of communication. I will be surprised if I get the check at all.< /review>< pics>

Frustrating to make a purchase. Large selection of scratch and ding items, good savings on appliances.  Sales team not engauged in the least bit, somehow failed to purchase a refrigerator with two different credit cards, and felt it was a ploy to be forced into their financing being constantly reminded.  I left and bought a new unit at Best Buy an hour later.  No issues.  Felt much better paying more to have an intelligent person assisting.</text>

My experience was not good.

But.....Steve, the acting manager is doing a good job of cleaning it up! When i was able to finally reach him, he was very understanding, calm and collected and did everything he could to complete my order and delivery in a timely fashion. I hope some of his manners and demeanor rub off on the employees and i think this store could make a turn around in customer service.

Thanks Steve.< /text>

Very disappointed  with the conditions the appliance I purchase online arrived. BEWARE IF ORDERING ONLINE. I purchased online in the CA outlet and the manager'd careless mistake declined my order by mistake. This delayed my order 4 extra days because he couldn't figure our how to get the order back to me. Once I was able to repurchase the item he marked it damage. Originally it was just open box with mo damages. When I asked him if was damaged he pro.ised me it was in perfect conditions. The item took 2 weeks to get to Florida. When the delivery arrived from a 3rd party company the oven was extremely poorly packaged.  It had the a thin box over it with no bottom but the bare appliance. No foams or any protection. The appliance a 4" dent on the front. Very visible. All of this could of been avoided with good packaging and protection. I was told that all of sears merchandise is packaged the same so it will definitely get damage during transit. When I called to complaint to see what could be done to fix the damage I was offer a $50 credit or I could just return  the item. The products are sold as a
Is. This really SUCK. A brand new expensive kitchen with a dented appliance as the center of attention.<//Review>

I bought a refrigerator on December 24 and they were supposed to deliver on December 28...and I still don't have my refrigerator, But app says They delivered!!
What is going on..
The delivery driver hang up the phone twice on me and told me not to call him, but office.. delivery office says.. they are very sorry but call the store.. store said they are sorry..but wait until Wednesday 9 am and they will call or deliver..they made a small mistake...It is Wednesday January 2, 9:45am and I still did not get phone call or my refrigerator is NOT here..out of all this situation..everyone is just saying sorry but not taking any action.
Kenneth is store manager, who refused to talk to me on last Friday and sales rep gave me her cell phone number to call if any issues come up getting refrigerator deliver today( January 2), but when I called her, she said I will call the store and find out what is going on and call back..that was 9:30 am..still waiting.. I call her, but she is not answering my call.
Also, when I call the store again.. Now, supervisor name Barbara answer..and she said they are trying to figure out what is going on..and will call back...now when I call the store again..it is only busy sound ...what is going on....I just want my refrigerator (that I paid already!!!)<//review>

Its a converted Sears store that is now an outlet so the choices are more limited than usual and vary from week to week but you can get some good deals and hard to find sizes/styles that regular stores no longer carry. Includes clothing for all ages/genders as well as large items like treadmills, washers/dryers, refrigerators and even big screen TVs< /text>

<Review>Chris and Mike were very helpful with my purchase.  Would definitely shop there again.  The only issue I had was the wait, they need more help BUT  they were great, even though they were very busy they still had smiles and a sense of humor.  thanks guys

<Text>Tried calling to check availability of an item. Line has been busy for over an hour with multiple attempts. Honestly I haven't heard a busy signal is years.

I would suggest having an answering machine to leave a number to call a customer back when not as busy. I'm going to say I think this answering machine concept was mastered in the 80s.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Don't do it they do not honor warranties from this place! Steer clear and buy new only! I lost $3300 from a lemon stove and the Sears PABA team refused to honor my extended warranty after 2 years of trying to get my convection oven to work and fix a short in the wiring! Huge waste of time and money just don't do it!!!</text>

Sent drivers out to my home 3 times without booties on their shoes. The first time I asked if they had some because my carpets were just cleaned. They walked back to their truck as if they were getting them and yelled out their window I refused delivery and left. After calling management at both the delivery company and Sears they came out a second time without booties. The thired time the manager promised me he had bought booties for the drivers and that we were gonna be the first stop on a new delivery date between 9-11am. It is now 2pm. No washer & dryer. No call, no delivery. Were currently headed down to cancel. Cobsidering the possibility of buying refurbished product or damaged goods that plus the customer service/delivery company is not worth it. We will be heading back to Best Buy, they delivered my stove and microwave quickly, as promised and professionally. I will never shop Sears Outlet again. They need to hurry up and go Chapter 11.< /text>

<review>Horrible! Issues with everything. Bought a refrigerator and 3 pieces of furniture on Oct 3.  The fridge was installed then immediately started pouring water out of the front door ice dispenser. Called 15 mins after installed and was told to contact LG directly.  Repairman came out and refused to fix it, claiming he has never seen something like that, and it clearly had been tampered with. He suggested I return it and get a new one, as this one had more issues than just the missing sensors from the dispenser.

Also, we were quoted 3 weeks for delivery on the furniture. Its 7 weeks now and we still dont have it.  Called multiple times and told different dates each time, and not one of the times has anyone apologized or tried to correct the issue.  After 4 weeks (Oct 31), we called again and were told it would be here on Nov 19.  Makes me question if they ever put the order in, that it would take an additional 2.5 weeks on top of the month we have already waited?

I just called again and was told this time that it is because "Ashley Furniture is behind, and it's taking 2-5 weeks"... um, it's already been 7.  I asked for a suggestion, and her response was to call back Friday or she wouldn't blame us if we came in and cancelled the order and got a refund.

No wonder why Sears is going out of business.  They used to care about customers, now you can't even get a simple apology when they sell you tampered, malfunctioning products and then dont give you the items you bought.< /review>< pictures>

Couldn't deliver refrigerator anytime but Monday's during normal work hours. In addition to the price I paid for the refrigerator and the $81 delivery fee, it would have cost me a day of leave from my job. I can get it cheaper elsewhere. Cancelled the order. I see why Sears is going out of business. Horrible customer service, horrible delivery company.< /Text>

I don't know if I've ever experienced anything like this store.  None of the appliances had any information about the items posted; no model number nor the description.  I can't remember such an unprofessional staff. There were 3 young adults working there.  Not one of them was helpful or knowledgable. They were not professional in any way. They were like kids having a yard sale. It was like pulling teeth to get them to look up a model number. They answered questions with the minimum of  information and no apparent interest. While I was there they left people on hold on the phone and forgot about them even when there were 3 of them standing around. One complained that someone had asked for his name earlier so he hung up on them!!  While I was there a man came in saying that he'd been on hold for 30 minutes so he drove over to the store. The sales people snacked at the front counter and chatted among themselves.  The man who had "helped" me the most didn't know how to use the cash register.  After he'd forgotten to include the delivery charge on the first receipt it I saw that he'd also forgotten my 5% Sears card discount.  Then they had to cancel the order and start over. This took at least 30 more minutes!!  The woman who I assume was the manager had to help him do it.  He asked me for my card at least 7 different times.  They couldn't find any of my phone nos. on the account, which I can't explain, then they wanted my social security number instead which I refused to give.  I was exhausted and hungry and disgusted with the process.  I would never shop there again despite the discount.  I can see why there were virtually no customers.  Why bother to have that store???  It only gives Sears a bad name.</text>

Once you could get ahold of someone, pretty responsive, though they are terribly understaffed. And they did not know their stock well. Only by what seemed like happenstance did a manager come by and told us they had more chairs in stock. We had called earlier from another store about a specific chair, and were told there was no stock here. Then when we arrived looking for dressers, turns out there were more chairs!< /Review>

will I can say yes to discount prices as well. However, some things are discounted due to wear and tare or even stains and rips on clothes and accessories. I even found some items that were cheaper buying at sears or Kmart because they still had the tags from the other stores on it and yet when I asked to get it that price I wasn't able to which is not right.

Oh, and no more buy one get one free on the clothes. why not? I didn't think to buy something for 2 or 3 dollars and 2 weeks later at $7 or 20% off 15.00 when it really is $7  or buy one get one free, don't you think we got it down now? oh yeah I was told new owners now . so what?  It brought business it worked well and the economy is so different everyone will go to get a bargain not jargons.
thanks

<review>Go here for barely discounted items that are all damaged.

Prices on refrigerators were marked around 50% off, but their "original price" is WAY higher that what is actually out there. For example, a Samsung fridge at Lowes brand new for $1299 is marked as "originally $2199, now $1099!" so really you're only saving $200 off the Lowes price for something with lots of damage all over it.</review><GmapID>0x808f9140ee6562a3:0xa23da4eea62cc30f</GmapID>< response>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Text>Understaffed and terribly organized. Most of the machines don't have proper labels, so we need to call someone for help to get even the most basic information. And every time we needed said help, we had to wait at least 10 mins before someone had the time. I found only one person who seemed to know what she was doing in this store, the other staff members seemed outright uninterested in helping customers. One guy dropped the ball several times while ringing us up, requiring us to start the process all over and repeating our information. We found out later that he hadn't even completed his task properly. Overall, the discount--which truly isn't much to begin with--wasn't worth the terrible service and bad experience. Wont be coming to this store again.< /Text>< pictures>

I don't shop too much any more (76 years, old) however, I still have my Sears card and needed to get
some sheets. Yesterday, afternoon, I drove over from Alameda to the Hayward Store on Winton. I used to work for Sears back in 1984. I worked in Customer Service and really loved my job. When I first arrived in America from Ireland, the very first Department Store, I entered, was a Sears Store. It was
on Army St, in San Francisco. Therefore, I have a strong attachment to Sears. I will continue now, with my review. It was about 6pm when I entered the store in Hayward, yesterday. The first thing that struck me was, how dark the store, seemed. To my surprise, I saw some Christmas and they were all lit up- the
light from the trees in my opinion, made the store look even darker. The store has an air of defeat and
lack of care. I hate saying this but, that's my impression. Now on the plus side, I found the sheet (had only needed one sheet for sewing project) that I wanted but, again the shelfs looked empty and sad.
Now, a change of pace. Soon after I entered the Bedding Department, one of the employee's approached me and was so helpful and nice. Her name is Claudia and she is such a great addition to
the store. I also want to praise two more of your empoyees- Pardeep, was helping to break in a new
employee whose name is Lavada. Pardeep, is just terrific. She clearly cares about the company she works for and all the customers. Lavada, has this welcoming smile and friendly attitude. She will be
so good as an employee of Sears. On that note, I will bring my review to an end. I enjoyed my trip
to Sears of Hayward and it was all due to Pardeep, Lavada and Claudia- I hope they get to see this.
Regards,
Rose Flanagan

my wife goes there on a regular basis to make good on the low low prices for clearance cloathing. she's a verry vigilant shoper and keeps all her resipts + takes advantage of some of the on line convieniences such as e resipts and some other stuff. HOWEVER!
AS OF RESENTLY, SHE HAS HAD A  VERY UPSETTING INTERACTION WITH THE STAFF THERE
AS A RESULT I AM HAVING TO GO DOWN TO THE STORE TO BE A REFEREE OVER A TRANSACTION CONCERNING A COAT.
THE ITEM HAS BECOME A MATTER OF PRINSIPAL. CONSIDDERING THE FUNDS SHE SEE'S FIT TO SPEND THERE,
I see little reason why she should be made to take such a hard boiled position on this "COAT".
Something tells me there is more to this than the superficial concern.
Result as of now?  I am verry disspleased with how they are dealing with my wife who is a loyal patron of the outlet.<//Text>

I give Natalie a five star rating. She was friendly and informative. Another budtender, that shines is Monique! Every one there has been great, even security makes me feel welcome.
Will I be a return patient? I already am!</Text>

< Review>
Dana, Hailey, Ace, Eric, and Alice have all gone beyond what it means to be compassionate bud tenders. They’ve helped me out, listened to me ramble without even looking annoyed haha, everyone is so cool and loves to talk and knows what they are talking about. Dana is always lovely over the phone, Alice seems awesome from our emails, Eric, Ace and Hailey were all so welcoming when we met. Def my new spot, the deals and the customer service and great product selection have gained you all a loyal customer</Review>

It was my first time trying this Haven location and it’s different for sure but super convenient and clutch I never had to leave my car that was sweet and tender Ruth was spot on. Although got a strand and was not what I would normally get at all but what can you do everything pre packaged so that sucked. But spot was legit recommended for all super safe and great service just gotta buy the pricier buds. But shot out to Ruth for making the experience even better get that girl a raise😁<//text>

< review>
The entire process is sketch. Nowhere online does it state that I have to stay in my car, so my first impression is having an oversized security guard yelling for no reason. I found this slightly disrespectful, but more of an unorganized ordeal. The "tender" is more of a cashier that has to make multiple trips inside and out. First to verify your Id, then take your money, then finally they come back with your order. For a place titled "express" I've had faster service from other Haven locations downtown. Prices are the only decent thing I found satisfying.</review>

This is a curbside location, so we do ask that you stay in your car due to the COVID laws to keep you and our employees safe.  You are more an welcome to place your order on site with your budtender, but if the order is already placed online, they must verify the ID before bringing any items out due to CA state laws.  If you'd prefer a walk in shop, we have several in the area, though it may take longer than our curbside pick up.

<Review>This place is ok its almost a good place tho but the flower is really extremely too dry to be that expensive an 8th for 100.00 bucks should never be that dry they gave me the wrong 14grams when I asked for 14grams of a different product the was a higher thc potency which was my fault for not checking the bag b4 I drove 10hrs back home 😠 I hope yaw get some better prices soon tho....< /Review>< pictures>

This was my first time here, I wasn't exactly sure how everything works. Ruth was the one that helped me and answered all my questions. She also recommended me to things I should try based on what I told her I like, and I really appreciated that. I will definitely be returning!<//Review>

< review>
After dealing with many 420 delivery services and actually having to wait pretty much 3-4 hours to receive my order/delivery; I discovered Haven. Haven is so convenient and your order is processed quickly. The staff is super friendly, and the product is quality. Enjoy friends!< /review>

<text>Hailey was a super great experience today. Fast and reminded me of my discounts and my free lighter today which was awesome. This s is one of the best stores around and so easy. My absolute favorite is Clayborne Denver Cookies small buds, today I got a great deal on an ounce. It’s perfect for me, Thanks again Hailey for your great service today, will be back in a few weeks.<//text>< Pics>

They’ve helped me out, listened to me ramble without even looking annoyed haha, everyone is so cool and loves to talk and knows what they are talking about.

It was my first time trying this Haven location and it’s different for sure but super convenient and clutch I never had to leave my car that was sweet and tender Ruth was spot on. Although got a strand and was not what I would normally get at all but what can you do everything pre packaged so that sucked. But spot was legit recommended for all super safe and great service just gotta buy the pricier buds. But shot out to Ruth for making the experience even better get that girl a raise😁</Review>

We will speak to him about this to make sure he's using a more professional tone.  This is a curbside location, so we do ask that you stay in your car due to the COVID laws to keep you and our employees safe.  You are more an welcome to place your order on site with your budtender, but if the order is already placed online, they must verify the ID before bringing any items out due to CA state laws.  If you'd prefer a walk in shop, we have several in the area, though it may take longer than our curbside pick up.  We hope you continue to be a customer with Haven, whether it's through our Express location or another.  Have a wonderful night. ❤"}<//Response>

<Review>The entire process is sketch. Nowhere online does it state that I have to stay in my car, so my first impression is having an oversized security guard yelling for no reason. I found this slightly disrespectful, but more of an unorganized ordeal. The "tender" is more of a cashier that has to make multiple trips inside and out. First to verify your Id, then take your money, then finally they come back with your order. For a place titled "express" I've had faster service from other Haven locations downtown. Prices are the only decent thing I found satisfying.<//Review>< Pics>

Often the Haven team promotes a calm environment. The employees know what there talking about. It's Curb side only . People should make there order online it makes it easier.

Not to mention having to be put on hold for 20 minutes or longer.
My daughter has been wearing her braces for 2 years and gap is still there! WTH

Friendly staff. My daughter needed a root canal. This was her first dental work she had to get done. She was scared at first, but after she came out happy and said the dentist did a great job. Thank you for making her feel comfortable and taking care of her tooth.< /Text>

I had an appoitment on 02-01-21 and waited over 2 hours to be seen. I did talk to the ladies up front and they said that for in inconvenience they would upgrade my silver crowns to enamal. I waited over a month and called my insurance and they told me I was declined due to my state insurance not covering enamal crowns. I did not authorize this and when I tried to talk to the office manager Veronica all she did was give me the run around. They charged my insurance for something I did not authorize and then when I called them out on it they set my appoitment just to sit me in a chair to give me a letter that stated: Since I have an issue with my care there they refuse to see me at that office. Those women are :MEAN GIRLS" who are extreemly unprofessional and not easy to so business with.<//text>

<Review>PLEASE DO NOT BE DECEIVED BY THE 5 STAR RATINGS! This place does NOT have consistent quality service. Yeah, the staff may be friendly, but they often overbook leaving patients sitting in a crowded waiting room to be exposed to each other's germs during the pandemic. I NEVER see anyone sanitizing things. In addition, I had to have impressions taken twice for a crown and while waiting for the permanent crown, the temporary one fell out TWICE!!! They are ALWAYS short staffed for actual dentist.  When this happens, you either wait long hours for treatment OR the receptionist will do you dental work! Did I mention the billing is also shady???? Run! DO NOT spend your money here!!!< /Review></record>

<rating>2</rating><review>My husband and I currently are patients at this office. My husband has had temporary crowns for over 2 months due to impressions done inadvertently and the kab rejecting them. There has been wrong information communicated to the doctor that my husband refused the procedure because it was for the wrong side if his mouth. We cannot change dental offices due to where we are in the process of services agreed to. There is a lack of consistent communication and professional integrity with the staff which impacts the quality of care to patients. There is definitely room for growth and level of the service to the patients.< /review>< Pictures>

I wouldn’t recommend this place for orthodontics, I took my daughter to this place and I regretted taking her there because It was almost going to be 2 years since she had her braces and I still see her overbite. I talk to the ortho about taking some of her teeth out would help with her overbite and he said that if it would be his daughter, he wouldn’t take her back teeth out because it was not necessary and that would make her nose look bigger. So I went ahead and took her to another ortho for a second opinion and they took X-rays and they explain to us that what we see on the X-ray it was necessary to pull four teeth out (2 top and 2  lower). Now that she is been seeing by this other ortho I now start seeing a change on her smile. After all, I do not recommend this location to anyone unless you don’t care about the type of work they do. Plus it is not clean and the staff are not professional at all and the assistants do not know what they are doing; I believe they are just learning with you because every time I saw new people. This place is terrible.🤮< /Text>

GREAT dental services at very AFFORDABLE prices.  Dr. Jamal, Veronica,
Ashley, and the entire staff, and the office are top notch!  They welcomed
me to get treatment during the Covid 19 crisis, when other dentists were closed. I felt safe that it was a very sanitary environment!
Thank you for being there for me Sahara Dental!</review>

<Review>I have been going to Sahara Dental for 5 or more years. I have always had a good experience and when Dr. Jamal see's me he always makes sure I understand the procedures he is doing  and follow up appointments. Today  5-22-20 in the late afternoon I was having a very bad problem with my mouth  ( not going into detail ) and Veronica took her time with me over the phone, told me she would call me back with an answer and shortly later found a way to take care of my problem until I could be seen. Thank you again to Veronica, Dr. Jamal and the entire staff at Sahara Dental.</Review>< pictures>

This is the first time I have written a review for anyone but it is deserving. I had nothing but great experiences while going to see Dr. Jamal. His team was great and he did a great job explaining everything that he was doing and listening to what I had to say. He kept me calm during all of my appointments and answered all of my questions. After seeing many different dentists I can say that Dr. Jamal and his team are the best I have seen and I will continue to go there and would highly recommend them to anyone.< /text>

First off the front dest staff Veronica and Elaine are so helpful and caring! They have different options for your care and financial needs and make you feel safe and at home with any and all needs you may have. Now for the back office staff all the ladies Mona, Jocelyn and Rikki are so helpful and caring and concerned even if its something as simple as me coughing they are quick to offer me water and make sure im ok. They ALL work wonderfully with the doctor which is a plus.  All the staff always makes sure that all your needs are meet and your doing ok throughout the procedures. The work atmosphere is so positive and everyone is always happy which make the office visit that much more enjoyable for me. Now for my Doctor (Dr. Farahani) is just wonderful. She is always making sure i have a full understanding of whats being done! And my concerns and questions are always answered. Honestly if your looking for a dental office that you want to feel at home with this is the place to go. You'll abosolutely love it here. Thank you all at Sahara Dental for taking such good care of me and my smile 😃<//review>

Wonderful experience! He sure is very passionate about his work. the fact that the Dr. would ask about my opinion about the options and went into detail to help me understand clearly was amazing. There isn’t any Dentist that I have gone too treated me with respect and actually cared about what I wanted and had patience for me. Felt like family and Good energy inside. Thank you and I am truly blessed.</text>

Normally I'm nervous about seeing new dentists but this place has proven me wrong. This is now my favorite. Everyone is great. The team, the doctors, the front desk, everyone.<//review>

<Text>Sahara Dental is a GREAT place to get your teeth fixed or for general maintenance and cleanings. Veronica, Jill, Ashley, and Jocelyn at the front desk are very friendly and helpful. They always do their best to make sure the patient is comfortable and to treat what is bothering you most first. The assistant Jessica was very nice and reassuring throughout my treatment. Dr. Jamal is amazing, by far the best dentist that I have ever had, he makes numbing and dental work as painless as possible. He knows just the right tricks to make it so you feel hardly any pain, if any at all.

I highly recommend Sahara Dental and Dr. Jamal's staff! Definitely deserves 5 stars!!! 😄< /Text><Pics>None</Pics></record>

I had nothing but great experiences while going to see Dr. Jamal His team was great especially VERONICA who works in the front. Dr Jamal did a great job explaining everything that he was doing and listening to what I had to say. He kept me calm during all of my appointments and didn’t even feel the shot and answered all of my questions. After seeing many different dentists I can say that Dr. Jamal and his team are the best I have seen and I will continue to go there and would highly recommend them to anyone.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>I went in as a new patient. Had to reschedule appointment twice before finally going in just to fill out paperwork and wait two hours in the waiting room. People came in after me were seen. I was never seen until I had to reschedule again for the next day. Got another call the following day to have my appointment rescheduled...want to waste your time ? Perfect place.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1576692117224, 'text': 'Sorry to hear that, you need to know that first appointment always take more time. The wait usually due to patient filling the paperwork, staff entering patient information in the system and waiting for the x-ray tech to take the patient x-rays, as far as patients came after you and were seen it is also normal since these patient are scheduled for dental treatment or dental hygiene treatment  and they do not have to wait for the x-ray tech to be available.

<Review>Worst dentist ever ! The wait time is ridiculously long. I got put in a room and no one ever came in to do my exam. I had to leave because they were attending to walk ins before me and I had an appointment! They took several people before me. They were rushing so I doubt they do a thorough job. Those 5 star reviews are fake ! DO NOT GO HERE I wish I could give zero stars.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I honestly don't regret of going to Sahara Dental. It was an amazing experience the girls that were helping were great.  They were able to book my appointments right away, they were helpful in any kind of way. I will definitely be recommending my friends and family to this dentistry.< /Review>

Highly recommend this office! The entire staff is extremely friendly and helpful and have made having to go for dental work an easy stress free experience. The dentists there have made me comfortable and confident with how my treatment and end results will be

UPDATED REVIEW: I am still a patient with Sahara Dental a year later because this office and it’s staff is still going out of its way to make sure their clients are well taken care of an given the best care possible while trying to save them as much as possible! Highly recommend to anyone looking for a new dental team!< /Review>

It has been a challenge finding a dentist that my whole family can go to.  We are relatively new to Sahara Dental, but the staff members are positive, friendly, and helpful.  The dentist does excellent quality work and is gentle.  I feel comfortable bringing my whole family.< /text>

I have been twice- first visit was there for an extremely long time but thought I would give them another try. For my second appointment they canceled and I had to reschedule my whole day.
I just missed one appointment- was sick and forgot to call in. Received a $50.00 bill in mail? The bottom of bill says we run on referral- do you think I will refer if after one missed appointment I get billed? I understand if someone continuously misses appointments but I missed one- you should waive the first one.<//Text>

Best dental office I've been to in a long time. The receptionist Ashley is amazing and very accommodating. They have allot of patients so sometimes there is a wait past your appointment but it's worth it for the time and care they take. Love the girls too they are always friendly and remember you. Definitely recommend.</Review>

I highly recommend this place for anyone in the Hemet area ! ALL the doctor here are awesome at what they do and make you feel confident about coming to get your dental work done. I recently had a crown done and the assistant Jocelyn was great 👍 she made me feel comfortable during the appointment and she makes a great temporary crown. And the doctor made my experience painless and enjoyable! Thanks Sahara Dental for always taking care of me<//Text>

Very professional and knowledgeable. Didn't have me waiting and efficiently moved me through the process. I was shown all the problems and everything was explained perfectly. All costs were explained outside the exam rooms (I have had dentists put cotton in my mouth, numb me up and send some in to go over all the finances....walked out). I don't know what could have been done any better. Five Stars *****< /review>

The staff was shorthanded today, nobody told me, I had to ask to find out. Instead of calling people with appointments and at least asking them if they'd like to reschedule they let everyone wait in the waiting room for over 2 hours. When I was finally seen  the staff member brought me to a room and just left. No, "the doctor will be right with you" she literally said nothing and just left. When I was finally seen, now 3 hours later, I was told I have a few cavities and will be needing a cleaning. That's it. They then asked me to leave, since it was now 6pm and they were closed.

Not only that, they were in such a rush they messed up this guy's fillings. Poor guy had to come back and wait an hour with the rest of us before being seen again.

Note how the rest of these are fake, 5 stars each when they all have one review for this place.

So, if you want to make an appointment, want to wait for 3 hours, be asked to leave but wait, make another appointment, and have your time wasted by all means this place is for you.<//text>

<text>I did like coming here but they dont listen to what you have to say. They will do xrays and say that there is nothing wrong but I still had severe pain after my back crown and fillings. I had fillings done and all my teeth hurt more then they did before the fillings in the front are over sized and clip my gums and tongue when I asked to shave them down a little they did but they are still misshapen not looking like a tooth.im very upset by this. Other then that they are decent.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80db6f51a2014a4f:0xc603e2e9c1d52d1a<//gmapID></record>

<Review>All I can say is awesome awesome awesome. This is by far the best Dentist  office I have ever been too. Dr. Jamal was just great. He is a very good dentist. I dont like going to the dentist due to the pain they cause me. It had been years since I had went to the dentist cuz all they want to do is pull my teeth out. For the first time they actually worked on my teeth and are actually gonna help me save my teeth and give me a reason to actually smile. The staff was great. They were all very nice especially one of the staff members Veronica who was very nice and helpful. Sure does know how to care for her patients.  Thank you Sahara dental.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>So, I've grown to be very afraid of "The Dentist", any dentist, after a baddddd experience way back in 2010. Matter of fact I didn't get work done until 7 years later with Sahara, that's how fearful I was. When searching and deciding on a dentist there were several things I was looking for. Do they accept my insurance? Is the staff friendly and professional? Are there Dentists here that will listen, ask, and answer with care and knowledge, and lastly are they well experienced?  Sahara dental in hemet met that for me and I'm returning for more work needed done. I can comfortably say I have no fear here with this group.</Review><Resp>None< /Resp><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

<Review>I don't like leaving bad reviews however sometimes it's necessary. When I scheduled this appointment I explained I was driving from Temecula to give someone a ride here. The appointment was at 10, it is 1130 and I'm writing this because after they finally just took him in for xrays another assistant comes in with another patient who came in after and tried to make my friend move to another room. The girls at the front desk were wonderful but that assistant needs a lecture on proper etiquette and what patients are going through.<//Review>< Pictures>

I would give it zero stars.
Switched dentists after 3 months. I kept dealing with different people, they said i needed 3 crowns because my old fillings weren’t refillable.  Since I didn’t know any better I let them do it, but it took one crown to be done in a month and a half. it wasn’t the wait of the permanent to come in, it was the whole unorganized office. One day I called and said that my temporary had fallen out they said “ sorry it’s Saturday we don’t have anyone here today, you can go to Walmart and get the temporary glue for dentures”. I tried to move to a different dentist to help me with my temporary crown falling out. But no one would touch unfinished work from a different dentist.. so I waited till my permanent came in  then I switched dentists after that. The next day I went to a whole new place and asked them for a second opinion and they said I didn’t need any crowns and they refilled my old fillings. What the heck!! I was beyond mad..
AND My husbands fillings kept falling out more than twice and then he had problems with flossing. He had to go back to because again no other dentists would help him fix another dentist errors. It was Ridiculous how much was done wrong.<//Review>

<time>1556216440134</time><Text>I  have been going  to Sahara Dental  for almost  a year now  . and in the age where  customer service  became  only  words in other places . I have seen more than excellent  customer service in this Dental  office  .and that would apply :
to the front area   Veronica , Elaine  and more   offering  great courteous
customer  service  and been very accomodating  in rescheduling  appointments  and  very  understanding and kind ..
Then Dr Jamal  he's very  talented in his field   and very compassionate
with great smile always...
Also Dr Farhani  is   absolutely  wonderful  and very skilled and helpful.
I am very appreciative for all the wonderful work they all did . and
i would recommend this place  to family members friends and anyone I interact with .  This  a  5 star place  without any doubt .. thank you all .

<Review>So I can not express how much my husband and I love this dentist office. We had a bad experience with another well known dental office, thinking they would do great for my young daughters teeth. Well they weren't. They had said my daughter had a dead front tooth refered us to a specialist that didn't take children. So I looked up this dentist office inline and read the reviwes and thought I will give them a try for my daughter. BEST thing I've done! The people explain from beginning to end what they will be doing they made my daughter feel like she was their child. I will not go anywhere else!! And I would refer family and friends here.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>The staff are nice. The doctor messed up on two of my fillings i told her i had went back an the other dr fixed one an she told me no he did not. So i was dreaming??! Yea right!.she could not admit to her mistake. I told her my other filling was not right it hurt for any liquid or food to touch it an i had it dont a month an a half ago an she tells me nothing is wrong with it and if it still hurts in two weeks she will re-do it. All of this is ridiculous! Obviously i will not be going back.</Review></record>

< review>
I waited in the waiting room for 20 minutes after I signed in.  They never acknowledged me so I asked them if they needed any info from me and the girl went "Oh! Yes we do!" Like she didn't even notice when I signed in.  I then wait almost 1 hour longer until they call me in.  I can hear the Dr is getting done with a patient so I'm like "ok, I'm next." NOT! Another patient comes in and I know I'll be sitting there a lot longer because she has so much going on.  I wait a little longer and then decide I should just leave.  I go out the back exit and when I'm outside, one of the dentists asks me what I'm doing. I tell him "It's taking too long." He then proceeds to throw his hands in the air and goes back inside. Thank God I didn't let that man-child touch my mouth!<//review>

I have been going here since I was born. The two owners have always been so nice, and their donuts are the best donuts in town in my opinion. Anytime I go anywhere else I feel like I'm cheating lol. I live extremely close to the shop and I always notice that they're up around 3 A.M. to make their donuts! They're so determined.

Please give this place a chance! I wish I could give more than 5 stars. They're amazing.<//review>

<review>I wish I would have known about this shop a long time ago! The customer service was outstanding, the store was very clean, and the donuts were so soft! I also bought a hot chai tea during my visit and I really enjoyed it. I highly recommend stopping by if you're in the area.< /review>< pics>

<review>Wow, am I ever so glad I tried this store. The person behind the counter was very friendly and helpful. We came in around 11 on a Monday. There was still donut I could have wanted and they looked delicious. We tried a buttermilk bar, raspberry filled and raised chocolate. We were not disappointed. I can't pick a favorite because they were all out of this world. I can't wait to come in again!</review>< Pics>

<review>Update 4/26/21
Not sure what’s going on, but I had a hankering for an AF, and was terribly disappointed.  Under cooked, standard glaze, and lack of the quality ingredients like apples.  Size was ok, but lacked the density of the past.  Once a 5 star now a solid 3 stars ☹️.

The holy grail of Apple Fritters!  Best in the Sac County for sure.  The 5th star was solidified when it only costs $1.50.  I’m an apple fritter connoisseur, and this is worth the drive for quality donuts.

Edit add-on:  I routinely travel coast to coast for my occupation and I taste AF wherever I go and this one so far has top the charts from Portland’s VooDoo to a boutique shop in Boston.  This is worth an outta the way drive to hit this monster up.  Trust me you won’t regret it I promise.  Read my other AF reviews you will know where I’m coming from.</review>< pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I love these donuts! They are so good! As an avid donut consumer, I have tried many donuts all over, but none compare to these ones! Every time I am in town I make sure to stop in a couple of times.
One thing to note is that because they are so good, they run out of donuts pretty early... so it is true that showing up around 9:30, you will probably have slim pickings. But that just speaks to how good they are! Overall I give them 5 stars because I have yet to find a donut that I like as much as these ones!
My one recommendation would be to make some more donuts to be able to cater to the later morning crowd.</Review>< pics>

< Review>
I have given this bakery two tries, arriving no later than 9:30 AM, only to find 2 trays of donuts in the case.  What donut shop has almost no donuts left early in the morning?  Half their cases are filled with drinks.  As to the quality of their donuts I'd say what I have tasted was good, but fairly greasy.  This bakery's lack of selection, a problem noted in other reviews, is a killer for me.  They have a competitor just down the street called "Donut Star" with similar prices,  lots of choices, and the best apple fritters I've encountered.</Review>

Their selection is limited and they never replenish their stock. Also the store is very dirty and some parts of the store clearly show need repair and or a good dusting. All in all there are better options if you want a good donut.</Text>

<Review>This is a mom and pop establishment in which the husband and wife work together. They are quick to get your order together so you don't have to wait long in a line and are out with your coffee/donut(s) before you know it. On the way out, though, there may or may not be any napkins.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x809adbeefd649205:0xe41b3f8f5c007f0c<//gmap_id></record>

Wonderful lunch combinations serving quality beef, shrimp, chicken or vegetables!
Meat portions are plentiful and apparently three ounces per selection.
The waitress brought three different sauces to dip your food in and you can upgrade your plain rice with garlic and onions.  It was very tasty.
Lots of side dishes available to add.< /Text>

< review>
So I looked this place up, haven’t been here in awhile and on Yelp it says make reservations. So I decide to call and ask if I can make a reservation and the lady rudely replies are you the person who called me earlier. First off Which I wasn’t, nor do I think I have ever called them. Second who answers the phone like that? This is horrible customer service. I decided not to eat there because one the customer service, two the false advertising. It’s just honesty so horrible to see this is what they think is ok. Please do not eat here. If I could give zero stars I would.<//review>

An experience unlike any other, in the best of ways. Be prepared to do the slinging yourself, but their delicious cuts (and I mean protein OR veggie) can be cooked to your preference in 5-7 minutes. Clean, friendly & trained staff, great ambiance, warm yet well ventilated/breezy environment. Looking forward to returning!< /Review>

<Rate>3<//Rate><review>It's not an all-you-can-eat-only type of Asian BBQ experience so prepare to spend $$$ for the specialty meats or you might not end up satisfied.

Otherwise the food is good.  They have a good selection of appetizers, sides, and regular meal type items.  Nothing is free, though, so again...prepare to spend.

On a way-off-the-side note, their website bombards your web browser with background data.  So if you're on a mobile device and you don't have an unlimited data plan, staying on their site will rip through your monthly allotment of data within minutes.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYGByQAspwLDty1C9ioKFDSJateIIcOCBfGkG8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlzCB92dI3rdnFbGYdD9l3fyBFLP6x9k1vfsd4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPLuhY84JRhct1kG8lGSrqHZN52Kscd_pVDI8D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_fXs12Bn-7D5AYULM5H1VSutiKaeJMuVHN-MI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCZ61qwZoi_7AIqYvBsPokl_PogmYl1Z-M_4YS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMakX2nN6oxLPmT4CDVOg0ye3l1zYS1mVPucL-T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwf42JzfnoMBkuh2D3cfaggdebsLMeuGXZ-wPH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOUv893EmA9xbe3Gxc4eUpBfnA26-RJOWpogwu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

This place has amazing happy hour food and drink specials. The table has the set up to cook as you go the finest meats. The rice is bomb too. From small little filling dishes to experiencing the entire theme, the experience is amazing. This is my favorite spot in Mira Mesa. The tables are not too intimate, kinda packed close, and even the booths have a thin barrier dividing the space, but that's my only complaint, and it's not worth losing a star for. Cheers!</Review>

<review>Best barbecue place in town!! This beats all the other Japanese AND Korean BBQs. Aside from all the variety of quality meat along with their unique (and delicious) marinade, my favorite is their beef tongue. The quality of beef tongue here has consistently been better than every other barbecue places I’ve been too. We always get one of the all-you-can-eat options. There are three different choices for all-you-can-eat. We decide based on how much beef tongue I want to eat that day. Not to mention, they have s’mores (with different flavors of marshmallows!) as a dessert option!<//review>< time>

< Review>
Hello. I am NEVER one to write a review or contact a restaurant but I just ate at the San Diego Mira Mesa location and I am appalled at how terrible the service was! There were barely any tables and our server did not have a clue about anything. Had to ask for each thing we ordered, for utensils, water; napkins, the check 2-5 times before she could remember to bring it. Finally brought out items an hour later after “it got lost in the kitchen” when we were basically done with the rest of the food.  She literally could not get it together and was not apologetic and did nothing to remedy the situation. I would never come back to this location due to how poor the service is. I can’t believe they have any return customers based on our experience. I wish I knew the servers name but whoever worked the patio Sunday evening around 6:30pm on March 28th should literally be “retrained” immediately.< /Review>

<Text>I hate to have to do this because I am not one to complain, but the customer service here is beyond horrible. Sometimes they take reservations and sometimes they don’t. It changes with whoever works there. I literally asked them if they take reservations and they said no, but had a sign up saying they take reservations right by the door. The guy lied saying they took down the sign and when I said the sign was still up he hung up on me! This is not a place to eat at. They also will make you wait an hour when there is like two people in the restaurant and it was like this before covid too. Please do yourself a favor and eat at a different bbq place because these people are beyond rude.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Everytime I come here, and you can see from previous reviews that this happened pre-covid too. There is so many empty tables but 30 min + wait time. It’s beyond ridiculous. The food is good, but it’s not worth the wait and the hostess/hosts are always rude. I won’t ever come back here again.<//Review>

All You Can Eat Japanese BBQ Restaurant. Me and my husband loves this place in Japan. Of course the food they serve there is much more authentic than this one in the US. But it is still great food you can trust. And I love the music they play here. There is a time limit of 70 minutes. By then you should be able to eat all you can. Call for a table reservation. They recommend it at peak dinner hours.< /text>

They have a great lunch menu and happy hour all day every Monday. Every other day happy hour is from 11:30-6:00 i believe. They also have a course dinner menu  for anywhere from 1-2 or 1-6 people, all you can eat, small plates/appetizers, and a la carte.

Every time we've been here the entire staff has been nothing but pleasant. From the ladies up front at the desk to the waiters/waitresses and our servers. They are always polite, friendly, and check on us often, asking if we need anything, refills, is everything ok...etc.

The food is amazing. Not only is everything always served fresh, but it tastes so good!!! The meats, the sukiyaki bibimbap, the garlic noodles and their kaarage chicken...it's honestly food heaven!

I always try to go for something new every time we come here but the favorites always win and I end up sticking to those. For sure next time I'm here I want to some of their new stuff and the ramen!<//review>< Resp>

<Review>We went there two days in a row! First we had the ramen (I suggest ordering the spicy one, the "normal" one is not to tasy) and various meat. Second day we ordered the all you can eat. It was delicious!! And it wasn't even the most expensive option (you can choose some different types)<//Review>< name>

Price is a little high, but not too high. Lunch could range from $25-35 per person for all u can eat. However they don't offer all u can est on weekends or special holidays.... That lunch cost us about $250 b4 tips... so it's about $300 total b4 we walked out and not even full. Last word is if they won't offer all u can eat then just go elsewhere or else you'll regret it. $$$< /text></record>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>Indoor capacity is at 25% max. Very strict on entering with only one person at a time to check in. Then you wait back outside until called. There were seating tables outside in their partial patio as well as inside. We had a booth inside and the table adjacent to our left and right as well as behind and front was blocked. Servers wore masks and gloves.

No AYCE, only a la carte. They ran out of a few items at this time like the Kobe Kalbi Short Rib and Yaki - Shabu Miso so I got Kalbi Chuck Short Rib and Toro Beef. Both came in 3.5 ounces which feeds one person. You should double up if you're sharing unless you eat sparingly. It can get pricing but we went during happy hour.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNND8LD_TFGgyH-glfxGqqwehjRRvUHyv9zZKO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

<review>I love this place. I’m glad that they are still open during these uncertain times. Try anything on their to go menu, you’ll be satisfied. Everything is cooked beforehand unlike pre-Covid times where you would cook it yourself. If you like garlic I recommend the garlic rice.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

If there is zero star, I would give them zero. The one star only for the thick, tasty sauce on food. Today is Valentines and they made all their table reserved with only one menu called Valentine menu. No all you can eat or the normal menu as usual if you do not ask their manager. The worst experience ever. I asked them to change the grill and wait first ten minutes until someone came and another ten minutes waiting the grill since there's no more grill available, which I have never had before. The server was nice and trying to help but the whole operation of the restaurant need to be improved a lot. Overall, disappointed!< /text>

Sucks about the indoor capacity limit. But the bbq here is really good. The meat is deliciously marinated.< /review>

This was a very excellent experience! The hostess and host were friendly and accommodating, even though there was a wait. Our server was also very friendly and helpful. The premium all you can eat option is a very reasonable choice for the amount of food to price. This includes small plate options, sides, vegetables, varied beef options, chicken, pork, and seafood. With a couple of choices for dessert.</review>

The food was delicious! I loved the variety of dishes that we barbecued. The meat was marinaded to perfection. I have to say the mushrooms were my favorite, though. It was such a nice surprise to end the meal by cooking s'mores for desert.< /Review>

Indoor capacity is at 25% max. Very strict on entering with only one person at a time to check in. Then you wait back outside until called. There were seating tables outside in their partial patio as well as inside. We had a booth inside and the table adjacent to our left and right as well as behind and front was blocked. Servers wore masks and gloves.

No AYCE, only a la carte. They ran out of a few items at this time like the Kobe Kalbi Short Rib and Yaki - Shabu Miso so I got Kalbi Chuck Short Rib and Toro Beef. Both came in 3.5 ounces which feeds one person. You should double up if you're sharing unless you eat sparingly. It can get pricing but we went during happy hour.</Review>

This place was not so good. The egg drop soup was lacking flavor. The BBQ meat was just Ok, our waiter wasn't very attentive. Wouldn't come back. Was not worth the $$$<//review>

Sadly, this is my second bad review in a week.
My SO and I wanted to sit down and enjoy a meal.

If you want to wait and not get seated, come here.< /Text>

<text>We always take the kids here (ages 3, 5, 7). It's expensive to do right but the happy hours are good and the entire event is fun. The kids love cooking themselves and the entire affair keeps them occupied and entertained. The way the "grill" is constructed there is an exhaust ring around the outside and the table does not get hot. It seems scary.. Especially if your kids are a little rambunctious, but we've taken many friends there with crazy children and it's has always been a big hit, not injuries in about a dozen trips!<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>This place was so good. I went with some friends and we all got the brunch deal on the weekend. It was a good price for how much food you get. Soup salad and rice, I upgraded my rice to fried rice for $3 more, so worth it. We had a couple specialty drinks and some $3 asahi from the brunch menu. The meat was so tender and seasoned perfectly. I love going to BBQ places where you cook it yourself, so I can get my meat just right. 10/10 will go again.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>I went here when they first opened and felt that the music was way to loud and the price was a bit too high. Since then this place has improved quite a lot with better service, prices and atmosphere. I recommend going here for a family get together and a fun experience eating with friends.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Went here for a dinner with friends. A very pleasant ambiance and the food is really great!! The only thing I had problem in is that meat portions were really small and they take a long time to serve food.< /Text>

I love gyu Kaku so much. Prime rib kalbi and garlic noodles are my favorites. All the meat is high quality, so although it's more expensive than your traditional bbq it's worth it. Covid as made it hard to come with big parties as max party size is 6 but the restaurant tried to accommodate us best they could while adhering to SD guidelines.<//review>

10/14 2:40pm  Frankly, Brandon is very unwelcoming. After not greeting us, we stood for a moment until he finally addressed us in a flat, irritated tone. It was along the lines of "What do you want?". If one's job is to host and seat people, they should do so without treating the customer as an inconvenience. I understand being in a bad mood but you should either leave it at the door when you clock in, or don't come into work.  Thankfully, our actual server was friendly and I appreciated that.</text>

What a fun place and experience!  This place is perfect for a date night, party of 4 or just fun with a friend.  You can have a larger party too!  I strongly recommend to make reservations in advance.The service is great, they are so helpful.  Don't go unless you love meat, you will see lots of raw meat.  To top off your experience you get to make a smore at the end.  So cool!  We learned a little tip, if you order individual meats you get less but when you order the dinner pre set meal you get tons!  So much food!  We spent $30 pp for our meal deal.< /text>

Quick service, good meat, and excellent side dishes. We got the samurai menu item, and I would say that the amount of food was very generous, and the sides (the noodles and rice) were also very good, if not on par with the quality of the meat. They have vegetarian options, but the menu has mostly meat options.< /review>

great service, A lot of options on the menu. sometimes you have to wait because it’s popular only thing is that they take kinda long to bring your food out and I don’t understand why because it’s just raw meat. Also pretty expensive</text>

<text>amazing service and food. the premium selection gave our table more than enough choices and we left very full and very happy. tables are a bit small for all the food they cram on there, and the desserts are great too.</text>< Pictures>

Most meats you choose ( that you'll grill yourself) come preseasoned. And well seasoned at that. The staff is friendly and attentive. Try the corn, filet, and short rib.

<text>Don't waste your time or money here.  It is very very  poorly managed.  Their wait time is always 1 hr plus even with multiple empty tables.  They only seat reservations and only exactly at your time.  Don't bother showing up early. I even asked to be seated outside where it was completely empty and still a 1 hr wait.<//text>< name>

< Review>
This is my go-to spot for holidays and special occasions. Love the atmosphere, food selection, and quality. If you go on a holiday be sure to make a reservation well in advance!

Food - Awesome selection and great quality, particularly if you splurge for the high tier items.

Price - If you do the all-you-can eat it's a bit pricey depending on the tier, somewhere between $25-40 a person. The weekday lunch combo is a great value (<$15 for a good amount of food).

Atmosphere and Service - I've been several times and have always had excellent service. The music is always awesome, and the booths are set up such that you can have a nice conversation no matter how busy it is.

Parking - The lot is shared with several other restaurants and stores. Be wary on weekends and after 5pm when the nearby Trader Joe's dominates a lot of the parking lot. I purposely go at opening (11am) to avoid parking issues.</Review>

We used to go when it first opened and back then it was great. Food was delicious and service was superb. It's been 3 years since we last visited, and the most recent trip dec 2019 was not great. Service was much slower and less attentive.  Food was still good but not as carefully prepared as before. We ordered the edamame and it was really bland and the pepper was overly salty.<//text>

<review>Tasty pieces of meat. The chicken, shrimp, and calamari are average or maybe below that. But you can’t go wrong with the phenomenal meat. Even the starters are decent. Their fried rice and garlic noodles are to die for. Prices are above average, but definitely worth it. I would recommend this place to meat/steak lovers.< /review></record>

< Review>
This was my first experience at a grill-it-yourself place and I really enjoyed it! We had short rib, fillet mignon, and the miso butter salmon, I HIGHLY recommended the salmon! I'm not usually a big fish eater, but this was really tasty! Everything we ordered was high quality and tasty.
Our server, Seth, was amazing. A very friendly young man, enthusiastic and offered some very good recommendations.
I will dine here again.</Review>

<Text>This place is pretty much a staple in my diet lol!  Seriously though, the food here is excellent!  I probably come here every other week at least.  My fiance and I are simply in love with this place.  The quality of the meats and the delicious variety of side dishes they have here is just amazing.

IMHO the best way to go about eating here is to do all you can eat so you can 'play the field' and try everything and see what you like the best. We've got our ordering down and usually get the same thing every time.   We always order garlic fried chicken, gyoza, yuzu shishito peppers, chicken garlic noodles, harami miso skirt steak (the best meat on the menu!!!), and beef tongue :)</Text></record>

Came with my 9 month old twins and their grandparents. Reservations are best to get seated promptly. The server was very attentive without being overwhelming and offered great tips in selecting our orders, really good music and a nice atmosphere thats family friendly. Would definitely come back. Good food, decent prices and great service from a diverse group of workers.<//Text>

Amazing food that you cook yourself on the grill in the middle of the table. I highly recommend the garlic noodles. They have happy hour all the time and you can download their app to get a discount while you're there<//Review>

Good food generally if you like meat but don't order the all you can eat.  For all you can eat, the time is limited for obvious reasons but they will delay your reorders to stretch the time and bring lesser quality cuts.  Even vegetable reorders were delayed.  Last night, never got the refill on vegetables.  It's classic  cheap buffet tactics and unwelcome when you are paying 300 bucks for three adults and two little kids to eat.  I personally would not go back being the person that pays the exorbitant bill.  Others in the family love the grilling at the table and it's undeniably fun to do, but worth it?  Mmmm. No. Do yourself a favor, go to a butcher and buy some nice cuts of beef and then BBQ at home with some zucchini.  Cheaper. Better.<//Review>

<Text>This place always has the most quality meat and fresh vegetable ingredients. Get ready for a full meal that will leave you satisfied. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the speed of service. But I highly recommend!< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80dbf917f1e5cc0b:0x2dc60609ca1384ee</Gmap_id></record>

A great place to meet with friends. Tends to get busy on happy hour evenings, so make sure you get a reservation ahead of time to avoid having to wait too long. Even with the happy hour prices, the bill can run a little high so account for that if you have a large group and splitting the check. Meat is great and the cooking surface is cleaned and replaced when needed. Staff can be a bit inattentive due to the influx of people, but with a bit of patience, you and your group can have a great experience.</Review>

<Text>Having visited several of these restaurants across the country I was excited to try one close to my sisters. I found the menus to be extremely overwhelming. They would do better to streamline the choices. I also found several of the meats to be lacking in flavor. The Kobe Chuck meat was extremely tough. This was a huge disappointment since I have eaten this meat at several locations and found it to be excellent. I also found the pricing to be a bit ridiculous mainly because there were too many choices and it was hard to decipher which way to go on decision making. Going out to eat should be relaxing and fun. You got the fun part but it was not relaxing to deal with your menu. I highly suggest you take a closer look at it and see what you can do to improve it.< /Text>< pictures>

The first time you eat here, you may feel that the price is a bit high but once you taste the meat and the selection of options you will feel that is honestly a deal! A few words of advice. Call ahead and make reservations and bring your appetite...you will leave happyz< /Review>< pics>

<review>The food was Delicious! We will Definitely be back.
But, the Fathers day discounts that they had posted Everywhere, we were told, Don't apply to this location?! What? That's the only reason we were there in the first place. ...as long as this doesn't happen again we will be return customers.< /review><time>1530370480788</time>< Pics>

<review>We had a reservation for 8:45, showed up at 8:40 and didn't get checked in until 8:50 (with the host a no-show for most of that time). Then after waiting half an hour for a table, we left without being seated. The host was MIA for most of our wait.

Having been in the past, the food is good. But the service has been going downhill, with long waits to order, for the food itself, and now to be seated at all.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Great lunch specials! You have a few different sets of meat you can choose from $9-$12, and they come with soup, salad, rice, edamame, and 4 types of flavored meat that you grill at the table. I can never finish, good portion! They even have the lunch special on the weekends, and a great daily happy hour too.</text>

Tried this place for the first time this week during happy hour. The prices were quite reasonable for the quality and quantity of food we received, and the selection was perfect. There wasn't an overwhelming number of choices, but the size of the dishes made it possible to try a little bit of everything that looked good.

This place is perfect for small groups, celebrations, and company dinners.<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Awesome food! Great dining experience! The staff was very welcoming and ready to assist. Would highly recommend this restaurant.

Had an opportunity to visit this restaurant for the 3rd time while in San Diego. Unfortunately, we had a few mix-ups with our order. Upon hearing about the error, the manager very graciously, (without being asked) came to our table, apologized, and reassured us that our order would be corrected. In an effort to make sure we remained satisfied customer, adjusted our bill and dessert on the house. Not only was the food delicious, the customer service was outstanding! I highly recommend Gyu-Kaku. Great dining experience!<//review>< Pics>

Used to come here when this place opened up. Loved the food and atmosphere. Just visited recently. The place has not been kept up and cleaned well. The quality of food was also lacking.</Review>

We had bad experience with our reservation. We waited 45 min even though we had a reservation but I still rate them 5 star because of the food and service once we were seated was excellent. Our party was large, 15+.

Very high quality meat. Side dishes were awesom. We ordered egg roll and spicy cabbage multiple time.

Best party clothes did not stink afterwards like most Korea. BBQ place.

Price is a little steep. But I think it is well worth it.</Review>

We figured that a be reservation wouldn't be necessary since it was noon on Saturday. However we were totally wrong. When we arrived and asked for a table, the waiter told us we would need to take 3 HOURS, although we could see numerous tables open. Either this place doesn't have enough waiters to serve everyone or they are too slow to do so.

Basically, don't come here unless you've made a reservation and are willing to wait for a couple hours for a table. Better go to Gen's instead for some BBQ and a shorter wait.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>This place is amazing. Period. They have great food and usually great service. But if anything is wrong the manager is all over it. We have tried to simply provide feedback on a few things, but he remembers us and goes out of his way to make sure that we come back again and again. The portions are huge and it has been my daughters go to place for a couple of birthdays already. Cannot reccomend this place enough!

<review>Great tasting food, awesome presentation, and you get to 'work for your meal' a little by being the chef. You can heat up the meat as much or as little as you want, getting each piece just right! Watch out for your friends swooping in and helping themselves though! Lunch specials are nicely priced for the servings and allows you to sample several different meats in one sitting.</review>< Resp>

<Text>Slow service.  Took 45 minutes for the order to come out for a person in our party when we went for lunch on a Monday.  Add in the time it takes to grill your food yourself at the table, and you're looking at a 1.5 hour minimum lunch, more like 2 hours. Meats were pretty tasty, miso soup was average, and the salad had a bit too much dressing.  Overall a decent value for lunch if you've got the time.<//Text>< gmapID>

The two of us went and did the $45 all you can eat. Not sure how we did it, but we ended up ordering about 30 dishes.

Skip the spicy marinated meat, it's not worth it.

Beef tongue was the best!<//review>

I am usually a believer that if i am paying to go out to eat i expect my food to be cooked when served to me, but this was fun. There is a cooking guide on your table to make sure everything is cooked properly. You even roast your own marshmallows for the smore dessert! The greenapple and the peach soju cocktails are delicious!! If you go on the weekend without a reservation expect a bit of a wait.<//Review>

It's okay.  They purchase the lower end meats and charge the higher prices. It's seasoned well very tasty, watch out for Cabbage wedge.  IT'S POWERFUL NO TALKING AFTER EATING THAT 👏< /text>

<Text>The service is great. The food is hit or miss based on the marinade on the meats. All meats are marinated so if you are gluten-free, this is not the best for you.  The down side about this place is everything is small, the portions are small so you have to keep ordering and the grill is small so you can't cook that much meat within the 90 minute time limit. They only do their ALL-YOU CAN EAT specials twice a year. Thanksgiving and Fourth of July.</Text>< gmap_id>

<review>Reservation recommended so call ahead of time 1 day ahead. The thicker cuts of beef are the best here, while the thinner slices need more flavour. Service is good and friendly. It has happy hour twice a day everyday except Monday which is all day.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>The ambiance, the service, and especially the food are all amazing. Being able to grill your own food is a fulfilling experience! If there's ever a wait, you can always hop to Bruski next door to have a drink beforehand. Since its very popular, make sure that they have your favorite meat(s) in stock beforehand! They ran out of certain beefs prior to our arrival, but we were satisfied nonetheless!</review>< Rate>

I have had Korean BBQ almost a dozen times. This was my first time trying Japanese BBQ though. The food seemed to be richer quality. The menus that I received were rather complex but I had a great time and enjoyed the food alot.< /review>

I love those Korean BBQ's of the same style, so I was excited to here about this place. All their meat is incredibly tender and so delicious. Service can be slow at times, but that's why you order a pitcher of beer. You'll definitely want a reservation to be safe.<//text>

<review>This place has very good lunch special ranging from $10-15 and $2 beer. Good decent meat quality meets quality customer service. It's not all you can eat where you have to force feed yourself but you'll get a lot for what you pay for... a side of salad, miso soup and other side dishes depending on your combo. I always walk out feeling full and never have to worry about breaking the bank here.</review>< pictures>

Great place. Meat is fresh. Lunch special is a good deal (8.99, 10.99 or 12.99) to try different types of meat. You cannot miss it if you are a meat lover.< /Text>

<text>Good food and ordered all you can eat, but was rushed out 30 mins before our limit due to a 14 person party that was coming in. Had all intentions of finishing everything we ordered but didn't have time because of the party that was taking our spot. Again good food, but for paying the price of all you can eat to not get the full experience, probably not risking it again.<//text><Resp>None<//Resp>< pictures>

<Text>We had another delicious meal at Gyu-Kaku! Previously we had dinner here, and we had such a great experience that we wanted to return for lunch.

We brought our two year old (which always makes me nervous), but he had a great time, and really enjoyed watching our food cook! The kids meal also comes with a smore that he was able to cook over the BBQ! It was a great family lunch!</Text>< userid>

<review>Great deal for lunch for about 10 bucks. Meat is good quality and portion is filling. The dinner is more expensive they are for 2 people but can serve 3.

Came here again for dinner twice got the meat lover the first time it was excellent. This can feed three people or two really hungry people. The second dinner was happy hour at new year's Eve with 2 other friends we reserved for 10pm. They called us telling us they had an early time and it wasnt crowded. We ordered the premium happy hour. Everything was excellent kalbi short rib was the best so we ordered an extra one. Will definitely come again.<//review><resp>None</resp>< Rating>

Ultimate great meat dishes. If I want to eat meat, I ONLY come here. Try to come during Happy Hour before 18:30, prices are half.<//review>

<review>The food was to die for.  Get the sukiyaki rice upgrade - I actually took lunch leftovers back home with me to the east coast, it was too good to toss.

Fun atmosphere.  The menu has plenty of pictures to help you figure out what you are ordering.  Dinner is pretty expensive but they have great lunch deals.   Its best to make a reservation at all times.  Its always busy with alot of business traffic.< /Review>

<review>Our favorite restaurant in Mira Mesa. Just make sure to make a reservation, it can get busy. All the meats are fantastic, we normally go for the $60 meal for 2 but it's enough to feed 3.<//review><Response>None<//Response><Time>1507402991758</Time><user_name>Steven Holland<//user_name><userid>111101604831431054829<//userid><Rate>5< /Rate><GmapID>0x80dbf917f1e5cc0b:0x2dc60609ca1384ee< /GmapID>< pics>

We got there and it took ten minutes to seat us even though the restaurant was mostly empty. Then we got ignored. For fifteen minutes, no one came to see us, to take drink orders, to acknowledge that we were there at all. I had to go up to the front to see if we had a server. I don't know ow whether we just didn't have one for our section or what was going on but eventually we got someone. We put our whole order in at once because we were afraid we'd never see anyone again. I legitimately cannot understand why everything moved asalowly ad it did. You don't have to cook my food, so why did it take over an hour to bring a plate of meat???</Text>

There was a pretty long wait for a table even with a reservation, but being so highly recommended we waited it out. So glad we did! Amazing atomosphere, and the food was great. We ordered the platter for four and a soup. Meat came quickly, and the soup shortly afterwards. Got the s'mores for dessert, and they were happy to replace the one marshmallow that fell on the floor. The service was attentive and kind. Will definitely come back soon!</text>

Reasonably priced for what it is especially the lunch deal.  But always hard to find parking.  Reservation recommended if you don't want to wait for an hour for your food.</text>

<date>1487960615223<//date><Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Been going here since it opened.  Tables are always open and we are always told there is a 1-2 hour wait.  Tables remain open while we wait and in some cases have remained open for the duration of our wait and stay.  Go early and have a drink around the corner, this place does't clear tables quickly so you are going to wait for that.  For whatever reason their food including their raw meats take a long time to come out.  Just seems like the staff in general are new to restaurants.  The upside?  The food is good, though we have left multiple times because it's not worth waiting over an hour for.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

would give 3 stars due to all the meats are marinated with sauces. However, I gave  4 stars for the meat quality. If you want to make the best of your bucks, you should come for lunch special. It is pricey.< /review>

Waited for 15mins after arriving for reservation. I ordered the bibambap bowl, which is normal a favorite. Rice was under cooked and very crunchy. Our group all ordered lunch specials which include salads. We had to ask our server for them 3 times before we actually received them, which was  after the main course  had finished and the check was paid. I won't be coming back here anytime soon< /Text>

Great place! It's pricey, but worth it every once in a while. The meats are seasoned well and are pretty good cuts. Make sure you make a reservation or you will probably have to wait a while.</Review>

<review>Very new experience for me. I'm used to the all you can eat Korean bbq with the stove in the middle and this was a very familiar set up. I ordered the ramen and steak. A lot of steak. It was very delicious.< /review>< Pictures>

Prefer this spot over most AYCE Korean BBQ places. Their meat is really high quality (Toro Beef & Filet Mignon are my faves) and they have really great customer service.

Would recommend making a reservation if you're going at night as they can get pretty busy.<//Text>

Good Japanese BBQ place. Our waiter was still training so he would forget a few items, take long to get our food, and double charged us for some appetizers. The food was good but  the grill was small.< /text>

I like this place better than any Korean BBQ spot I've been to.  A little more expensive than your typical Korean BBQ but it's well worth it.<//Review>

Eh, not impressed. Over a 45min wait (understandable for a Sat night) but then to have mediocre food and crummy service. Ya won't be coming back. To many other spots to just be less than ok.< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Gyu-Kaku is a fantastic little Japanese barbecue joint. You order single servings of meat to compose your meal, and then grill it yourself. Personally, I love the meat lover's plate at lunch time. You get four meats, a salad, miso soup, and rice for 10.95! You have to upgrade your rice to beef sukiyaki, however, as it's only three dollars and totally worth it. I highly recommend this place for lunch, and be sure to make a reservation!</Text>< pics>

Amazing place manager is a lot of fun and food is so fresh. You must try the spicy yakishabu. And if you dont like spicy they do the yakidhabu in miso as well.<//text>

Having been to several Korean and Japanese bbq places in K Town LA and in the Clairmont area of SD, I felt this place was overpriced and offered fewer food options than competitors. But it was clean and service was good. I would only come here for a special occasion as the all you can eat price is $30 to $40.</text>

<review>I normally don't go to these kinds of places because I hate cooking my own food when I go out to eat but this place serves other things too. I like their stone pot rice entrees and the volcano tuna. I've had the ramen here before and it did not compare to the good ramen places in the Kearny Mesa area but it's alright.< /review>< user>

Not a place for a solo dining experience because it's designed to be a more communal group dining. Bring a group here to split the cost and also get your money's worth from the individual portions you will get for your meats and other side dishes.</review>

We came on a Sunday during happy hour. Place wasn't the busiest but our server wasn't the quickest or most accurate. He forgot to bring our appetizer and got my beer order wrong.
We both ordered Ramen which was not as good as you would get from authentic Ramen joints but still tasty.
Their happy hour prices are great. For example they have stone ipa 60 oz pitchers for $12 and various appetizers for under $4.
We will definitely be coming back, but likely only during happy hour.
As a side note, there is no separate bar or TV's, so don't come here if you need to watch a game.</text>

This review is coming from someone who doesn't eat meat very much.  I ordered a few of the tofu and veggie options and wasn't impressed with the way it all tasted.< /text>

The wait is long at peak hours. Around 2 hours so be sure to plan ahead. They take reservations for only 2 hours ahead.<//review>

It's always fun to take someone to Gyu-Kaku that hasn't been before. Grilling food at a table can be a very fun and communal experience. Keep an eye out for coupons and lunch specials, as it can get quite pricey.< /review>
