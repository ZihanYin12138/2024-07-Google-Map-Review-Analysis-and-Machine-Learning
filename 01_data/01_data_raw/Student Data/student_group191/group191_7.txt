<Text>Came in to replace my old bottle. They were out of the size I was looking for and I asked the staff if they would be getting more next week or sometime and he just mumbled “I dunno no timeline” like ??

So I bought a different size, didn’t fit. Came back one hour later to bring it back. Totally unused, not opened bottle. The staff goes “all sales final”

“What? I just got this, I never put anything in it, I didn’t open it, etc.”

But he just parrots the same phrase “all sales final” not even a sorry

< Review>
Got 9 gallons of water. Came out to $8.something. Place was ok and person at counter was very nice but come on.
**Edit**: After looking at this again and the reply Im changing my review. I did infact get RO water, and their price was actually pretty good for RO, and it looks like the price gets even better if you buy in bulk or get on one of their plans - so my mistake. Best place to get water in town.< /Review>

<Resp>{'time': 1574794160628, 'text': 'Hi Duncan, so bummed for the two star review!  We really pride ourselves on good customer service and quality water.  I wish you would have asked why it was so much, I could have explained that is was distilled water you purchased.  Steam distilled water is actually our Reverse Osmosis water heated into a vapor and then cooled and condensed back into a liquid state, after that we put it back through coconut carbon filtration and ozone for the purest drinking water you can get.  We offer the less expensive  option of Reverse Osmosis water per gallon also.  You can always choose to pre-pay for a package of gallons for a 10, 20, or 30 percent discount too!  I would love to show you our processing room so you can see what we are all about if you ever want to visit us again.'}<//Resp>< gmap_id>

I'm a long time customer since they opened. Both purified and distilled water are available. Fill it yourself. A bit of a discount if you create an account. Price is lower than stores. They also have miscellaneous dispensers and other water related items for sale.< /review>

Who knew water could taste so good?

Updated to 5 stars because the Water Store has been taking great care of me for about three years now.

Stop drinking nasty Santa Barbara tap water, stop drinking gross Brita filtered water, and get yourself over to the Water Store!< /review>

Nice store, nice people ... be careful with the products. We bought the ceramic water system and it cracked in less than a year ... made in, you guessed it, China! We tossed the whole thing out ... a piece of crap.<//text>

I'm sorry that it broke so soon on you! We do offer other water dispensing options other than ceramic crocks too :)  Please contact me via email waterstoresb@gmail.com or phone 805-683-9600 to see how we can remedy this, I know it's been a while but we just started looking at and using our google business page, sorry for the late reply."}<//resp>

<Review>They are very helpful when it comes to passing off your furry friend over for the day. Weekend service typically takes 3 to 4 hours. They offer nail trim and/or grind, canine friendly nail polish, bath, flea dip, teeth cleaning and trim.
My 50lb shepherd mix had a bath, flea and nail grind for $55-$60. Don't forget to tip!<//Review><gmapID>0x80c2d943b707433b:0x5da1d69c7ee6d023</gmapID>< resp>

This place is wonderful! Staff always friendly and my dogs love coming here for a bath or to see the vet that comes once a month. I had my small dog’s teeth cleaned here and they did a great job for half the price of our regular vet. Can’t say enough good things about this happy dog place!<//Text>

The Dog Zone is the best! Been taking my dogs there for years. No appointment necessary for a bath, and they're open on Sundays. My dog doesn't like baths, but she gets lots of love and attention there, that I know they treat her with care.<//Text>

My dog just loves this place. He goes to the day care, which is outstanding. They really watch the dogs and make sure everyone plays nicely. The staff is very loving and knowledgeable. The groomers are great and we've even attended some of the dog training classes and have had excellent results. This place is such a gem.< /Text>

Reasonably priced, professional, friendly.  The dog I brought this time is blowing her coat, and no amount of brushing was helping. She looks 100% better, and I have to think she feels better, too.</review>

<review>I have been going to the Dog Zone for years. They are caring, kind, and do a great job at a reasonable price. They gave gentle loving care to my 16 year old toy poodle during his last years. My ten year old mixed breed small dog is a very neurotic dog, yet they are able to put her at ease. She always looks awesome when she leaves. Feel confident going there, you will not regret it!<//review>< pics>

<Review>The Dog Zone is also the CAT Zone!! I took our long-haired little girl in for her first trim to prevent matting, etc. The staff was very friendly, gentle, and attentive. They also encouraged me to watch the process through a large window, so I got to see just how gentle they remained throughout the clipping. Whereas it was brief, it involved "sensitive areas," and yet our little girl stayed still and seemed relatively calm. They even did a "first run" and brought her to the window (because you can't put fur on once you clip it off!) to see if I wanted more done.  I appreciated this extra care and their attentiveness to my stated preferences. The cost was also very reasonable.  In just one visit, I am totally sold, and I would recommend them to any caring cat owners. Five stars indeed!<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2d943b707433b:0x5da1d69c7ee6d023<//Gmap_id>< date>

<Text>I can't recommend a better groomer. The entire staff is friendly, and they treat each dog as if they were their own. The facilities are spotless, and we are always excited to see our two dogs sporting a new fad scarf appropriate to the season or holiday. We always receive compliments on them when they are out for their walk.  Debbie and Linda are amazing owners and truly take pride in their business. As local business owners they are constantly finding ways to stay involved in the local communities.  Word of advice, if you don't want your dogs treated with love, kindness and compassion this is not the place to be.  P.S. Looking forward to the Day Care Center...dogs need to play to.</Text><date>1371596628687< /date>< username>

These groomers are kind to all the animals.  I take my dogs there and they are taken  care of with love.  I didn't know what time they closed one day and they finally reached me; two hours later.  I went in to find her petting my baby and giving her water.  They are just so kind.  Not to mention they also do great hair cuts and grooming!  I am so happy they expanded to day care and have a bigger facility.  I love supporting entrepreneurs and I highly recommend supporting this place!  I wouldn't go anywhere else!< /review>

We dropped off our dog Jasper here for a few hours last Saturday and he seemed to do just fine. The staff here was also very friendly and caring. I would highly recommend this place if you need you dog watched for a few hours.<//review>

<Text>The Dog Zone is absolutely great!  Our German Shepherd is noisy, rambunctious and sometimes doesn't like other dogs.  The staff takes it all in stride.  He comes out clean, soft and always sporting a bandanna.  The really important aspect is that he loves going there.  He can hardly contain himself when we walk in the door and he sees one of the staff members he knows, especially Joe.<//Text>< rate>

Our pup is 105 pounds of Golden Doodle and is only 3 1/2 years old. He is a BIG bundle of puppy energy and everyone at the Dog Zone knows how to handle him.  They are more than groomers, they are dog lovers.  It shows!  They are the best and our pup can't get out of the car and into their doors fast enough.  They treat him like their own and that makes us all very happy.  I know he is always in good hands there and I never worry. They are simply the best and we wouldn't take him anywhere else!< /review>

My cocker spaniel/poodle mix dog, Gatsby, loves this place! He gets excited about going to be groomed. They do a great job every time- he looks nice, smells good, and his fur looks great. I know it's a good sign when he's eager to go back and isn't afraid at all. We love Dog Zone!</Text>

They are kind, courteous and efficient. Their prices are more than fair and they always do such a good job with our 3 boys (Peanut, Patango and Cole) From the owners to the staff, everyone is so wonderful! Shout out to Bruce!< /review>< pictures>

I've been taking my dog, Fiona, to Dog Zone for three years. She is a shy girl, but loves the staff at Dog Zone. They are kind and gentle with her, and she always looks beautiful when I pick her up. The new facilities are fabulous, spotlessly clean and I'm always able to find convenient parking. I highly recommend Dog Zone. The staff are professional, kind and caring, and the facility is clean and well maintained.<//Text>

They never bat an eye if I ask for something out of the usual realm.  The pricing is fair, the people are A+, and although I haven't seen the new location yet, I bet it is great too.  Highly recommend Dog Zone!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

I need a Groomer; who can handle a large dog, a Great Pyrenees; who is a Therapy Dog. The Dog Zone took good care of my Bernie for 5 years.  He was bathed quite often; since he visited hospitals, libraries, & hospice sites.  Now with my new female, Belle,
they will help me continue my Animal Assisted Therapy Volunteer Activities.
Thank you all; and especially Joe.

Some are still with us and some have passed on, but all have enjoyed their visits to Dog Zone.  They receive gentle and loving treatment there and come home fresh and clean, brushed and beautiful and in Brewster's case with a smile on his face. Corgi's do smile, you know.

I wouldn't take them anywhere else.< /review>< Pictures>

Ray is the best barber at this location by far. I always leave a generous tip for him since his service is superb. He’s definitely my go to guy when I am in the area to visit my folks.< /Text>

Prices are the best around but I only come here for the lady with the red hair. She’s the best, is very understanding and cuts hair just the way you want it.
Got my haircut by the guy closest to the door today though and he seems to cut hair to his liking as he wasn’t listening to the way I wanted my hair cut and left everything too long and the back of my head uneven.</Text>

I think they have only changed their price on a haircut once from what i can remember and it wasn't much it went up from $8 to $10 For guys i recommend waiting for Ray he always does a great job and uses the barber knife where he needs to shave anywhere on the head mustache or beard!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Recently, found this place. An old gentleman cut my hair last time and it was a great experience. I had tried different places and I finally found a really nice place. Totally recommend it. Also, the prices are really great!</Text>

Very affordable. Long wait time. But only because I ALWAYS get my haircut done by a certain barber that I like. I won't say who it is even though I'm sure it's obvious when you go. There are only 2 male barbers. The ladies cut men's hair too. But sorry I just don't trust em. My barber is always sooo nice and courteous. He also knows how I like my haircut every time. I don't even have to tell him. He still asks jus in case I want something different. My hair is thinning and he knows for the most part how to not make it looks so obvious that my hair is thinning. The only downside is the wait time.</Text>

This great little cafe is a hidden gem with free wifi. I love the Vietnamese iced coffee. Having lived in Saigon over the years this place makes me feel at home. Prices are reasonable. Late afternoons are not as busy and very relaxing.< /review>

<text>Food is really good for the limited options they offer, but I would suggest you order to go if you're not a smoker. The cafe is so small that you're basically sitting next to the smoker since they leave their double door open. It would get a better rating if not for all the smoking. Horrible place when you have kids.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Not spicy at all, fresh and warm with good taste, I ordered the combo with yellow daal, channa masala and rice, quantity sufficient for one! You have to order naan or salad separately< /Review>< pics>

<Text>A no frills, cheap yet delicious takeout place. I had rice, dal, palak paneer and a naan, all for $12! Can't believe i could get all of this for so less in LA. I had to wait for about 10 minutes after placing the order. There's plenty of space both indoor and outdoor the food court to sit down and eat. Would definitely come again and would recommend this to everyone!<//Text><gmap_id>0x80c2c7b118850a8b:0xc67380ff6097dd0b<//gmap_id>< user_id>

In addition to that, the cost is reasonable. I praise this spot with pleasure.< /text>

Mr owner, the food is great but the curry doesn’t taste like a curry. I was craving curry and i got chicken with some sauce.
Everything else is great though.
Even though the delivery took forever, it was 5pm traffic I guess.</text>

I'm a super huge fan of this place. The first time I had it was at their Beverly Hills location, but I move for work and have been going to the downtown LA one for a while now. The service is quick, the food tastes the same each time I go and you can't beat the price! My favorite dish is the chicken curry bowl. And you have to get the garlic naan, so delicious!<//text>

WORST EMPLOYEES EVER!!!
I have been going to this place for a couple years now.
The food is pretty good for the price.
However, they hire the laziest, sloppiest, most apathetic employees on the planet.
Seriously, Oscar the Grouch would be happier to see you than anyone that works here.
Most of the time they hang out in the back.
You have to stand out front waving your arms.
Even if they see you, they might take 2-3 minutes to come out because they truly do not care lol.
If you arrive near opening or closing you WILL NOT BE SERVED!!
Direct quote from the manager:
"I always close my store early so I can be out of here by closing."
So instead of working until 9pm, they close at 8:45 and don't care if you are hungry.
I waited in line only to get to the front 10 minutes before they closed, and told they wouldnt make me any food.
You are a fast food place homie!  Not a 5 star restaurant.
Please fire this terrible staff and hire literally anyone else.<//text>

<Text>Saffron and Indus by Saffron are my favorite fast food restaurants to get a fix of Chicken Tikki Massala, Buttery or Garlic Naan and favorite sauces including sweet tamarind. I love the exotic spices. Great customer service and my local go-to is located inside the Food Hall at Fig7th/ Downtown Los Angeles. High traffic and volume depending on peak hours and very busy holiday shopping seasons.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>I order samosa for to go
I was waiting for my order
The cashier he didn’t call my order number
Then I want to ask for my order and he said I call you By your order number
Then I said I’m waiting my order you didn’t call by number or anything about my order then  he started  argument  with me he already gave my order someone else
He is really  stupid and bad customer service<//Text>< Pics>

Indian for the Non-Indian
As a "noob" of Indian cuisine I cannot speak to the authenticity of the food, I can only speak to what it tastes like on my palate.  I basically stick to the Chicken Masala or the Chicken Curry.  Both wonderful dishes on their own and in combination of the garlic naan that they have.  There are pros and cons to the chicken curry though.  The chicken is cooked thru a little better so the chicken is more tender and moist but if you are going into a client meeting in the afternoon, don't eat it for lunch.

Hot and Cool
Be aware, the spicy sauce, drum roll please......is freakin' spicy.  Go figure right? A spicy sauce that is finally spicy.  A little too spicy I may say, but it may be awesome for more manly men than me.  The good thing is, there's also a cool minty sauce to cool down your tongue if you accidently add too much spicy sauce!<//text>

<review>This place offers cheap and very tasty indian food. I can tell that the indian food doesn't taste very authentic and is more an "americanized" version. However, the flavors are still pretty tasty here and everything is under $10!

I would recommend getting the chicken tikki masala with some naan bread. You can never go wrong with chicken Tikki Masala. Food here is served quickly and there is plenty of seating around the food court.< /review><response>None< /response>< rating>

This is undoubtedly the best indian place in LA. I recently moved out of downtown, and nothing compares to the taste of Indus. Please open more restaurants in Santa Monica!< /Review>

Shiv temple which is temporary closed for public and allowed inside only prior notification or appointment. Nice holy place with kind of aroma and positive vibes to charge u with devotion. Have other god and goddess like Ganesh, nav grah, lakshi mata and parvati mata. Campus is good, temple maintain one small office, garden and a hall.<//Text>

<text>Very devotional and authentic place in and around Pasadena. Importantly , Temple also have Dhwajasthabam which I rarely see in small Temples in US. You see poojas, abhishekam, Uthsavams to respective deities happens everyday. Another good part , it has so many Tulasi plants and Neem plant/TREE, which you never get to see in US. Temple also sends notification on poojas and special events that happens to your email I'd, if you register... Have great devotional time near your home!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Awesome place for people who like to visit temples. This temple is in traditional south Indian style and different deities are present. The day I went, there was a grand abhishekam to Murugan with ekadasa Rudra pathanam. Marvellous<//review>

I've lived here for almost a Decade. I've watched the quality of life, the quality of the park and the value of properties decline every year. The park is managed by Sierra Corporate Management.

Tustin Village Mobile Home Park is billed as a "Gated Community". The only thing gated about this community are the two black gates that swing open and closed 24 hours a day with anyone and everyone coming in and out. There is NO security. The Gate Code has been the same for 10+ years. I've watched people (who don't live here) bring entire families to use the pool(s) and clubhouse facilities. I see people driving through here who DON'T belong here. There's trouble lurking within this gated community.

I've watched many people forced out of their mobile homes by skyrocketing rent costs. New tenants are expected to pay $1,600.00 per month space rent in addition to any mortgage payment they may have for their mobile home. Rent goes up approximately $80.00 per month every year (May) like clockwork. Meanwhile, surrounding mobile home parks are under $1,000 for space rent and are much nicer with much higher property values.

I've watched more than a handful of people just walk away from their properties. I've watched the elderly, folks on fixed incomes, forced out of their homes. The rent keeps going up and the property values keep going down.

Why am I still here? I'm stuck. I'm upside down in my property which I shouldn't be. Because of the exorbitant rent costs, the value of the mobile homes here keep declining. The only way for me to get out at this point is via a short sale or move my mobile home to another park.

If you're thinking about buying at Tustin Village Mobile Home Park, please reconsider. You can find much nicer mobile home communities within a 10 mile radius that are not run by a firm like Sierra Corporate Management. Many are privately owned like the one directly across the street from us which is a night and day difference. Their space rents are under $1,000 per month with property values 2x to 5x more than what they are here.

In summary, Sierra Corporate Management doesn't care about its tenants. It's a profit making machine. It's a shame many of those profits don't find their way back into the park. This is NOT the place to raise a family, especially if you're on a tight budget. My suggestion is to look at the other mobile home parks in the area or go down the street and rent a 2 bedroom apartment for $1,600.00, you'll be much better off, trust me.<//Text>

do not buy or live here space rent is ridiculous and place is dirty and if you ever want to sell your place you will not be able to do that and park will end up keeping it and reselling it and making money on your behalf< /review>

(Translated by Google) This year has been the worst regarding management communication with the residents. The owners of the mobile home park change the rules constantly. They have changed the guest parking runes more than 3 times this year. They don't send letters to residents homes regarding the changes. They also got security guards now and were never clear about the rules. Overall I like my neighbors and its a calm place to live.

Este año ha sido el peor en cuanto a la comunicación de la administración con los residentes. Los propietarios del parque de casas móviles cambian las reglas constantemente. Han cambiado las reglas de estacionamiento para invitados más de 3 veces este año. No envían cartas a los hogares de los residentes sobre los cambios. También consiguieron guardias de seguridad ahora y nunca aclararon las reglas.
Es un vecindario agradable en general.<//text>

After searching for a nail salon for over a year since I moved to Fremont. They are very skilled and super patient. & certainly did understand and did it precise. So even after 2. 5 weeks of nail growth, the growth is not too noticeable. Will definitely be back next week for a refill on my full set. I absolutely love the end result.< /review>

They are a bit casual, but price, service and flexibility of them working around my time is unbeatable.  They could use a better nail design expert and maybe a bit more message on Pedi.  However the application of nailcolor is long lasting and I don't even use gloves to do dishes.< /review>

They are a bit casual, but price, service and flexibility of them working around my time is unbeatable.  They could use a better nail design expert and maybe a bit more message on Pedi.  However the application of nailcolor is long lasting and I don't even use gloves to do dishes.</text>

I had one of the best experiences going to the eye doctor.  I will forever go there and refer others to.  I felt in such good care.  Class act services from start to finish.  Dr K is awesome.  Not real good with bedside manners, but I’d rather have a doc that is straight up than making things pretty for me.  He was straight to the point.<//text>

When you make an appointment for 1:30 keep your appointment. I waited until 1:45 at which time I checked to make sure I still had an appointment. The waiting room had 8 people by then. “There is a problem I have been reading about that warns me not to stay indoors with others for more than 15 minutes.” I then went outside to wait. At 2PM I informed the desk I was leaving.
Let’s consider this scenario; What if all of your patients showed up 15 minutes late?  I bet you would make some policy changes!  Now keep that thought and double the time to 30 minutes and I imagine you would start charging!!
So why were you so rude to me!  If the exam is going to be delayed by more than 5 minutes you should advise the patient. If it is going to be 15 minutes you should make the effort to find the person and apologize and tell them what is going on!  If it is 30 minutes you need to reevaluate your entire process or do like a plumber and say “We will make an appointment for anytime this afternoon.< /review>

This was my initial visit on referral from my primary care doctor. I signed in and was provided with paperwork. I completed it in the comfortable waiting room. (They have an awesome salt water fish tank to gaze at). My appointment didn’t begin for 45 minutes after my scheduled time. However, they are very efficient once it’s your turn.
I did some preliminary work with the technician. After another brief wait I met with the optometrist. He was professional, worked quickly to assess me. I was ushered to the front desk for a follow up. The doctor shared what weren’t concerns but I didn’t have any answers to reason I came in (difficulty tracking, blurry/double vision). I was unclear about next steps, cause, etc. but I guess this happens on revisit?< /Text>

I’ve been going to Milauskas Eye Institute for several years now and have always been very happy with the quality of care I received there.  The staff is polite, attentive and professional. Exams by Dr Emberland, my doctor at Milauskas, are very thorough; he answers my questions and communicates the results of the exams and his observations with me.</text>

< Review>
What a wonderful experience I had at Milauskas Eye Institute in Rancho Mirage!!  I had been having a problem with my eye for about a week and had already been to Urgent Care.  I called them and they were able to get me in the same day.  The lady that answered the phone (Jennifer) was so kind and helpful.  The ladies at the front desk were so welcoming and friendly.  Dr. Tornatore was fabulous!!  I didn't wait long to see him.  He was professional and thorough.  He was able to diagnose the problem and got me on my way to a pain free eye.  I will definitely return to Milauskas in the future!< /Review>

Really bad check In , & unprofessional. Came in and a emergency patient for a possible detached retina with light flashes/ vision loss. Front desk was very lazy and made me call to get my insurance number rather then using my social and calling herself. After completing that task for her she tells me she needs 20 percent up front of the visit which she has not mentioned on the phone. She started arguing with me about it then said she couldn’t see me until I paid up front rather then bill me 20 percent. My parents recently purchased a home in RM and we’re going to use this clinic but now they are disgusted. For reference I the women was Mexican with purple hair checking me in.< /Review>

<text>This location is fantastic! It's very convenient from where I live in Cat City.

From the moment you walk in, the staff at Milauskas Rancho Mirage is very welcoming and personable. Everyone was so nice!

Dr. Emberland was awesome! He made me feel very comfortable, and actually explained things thoroughly whenever he was doing something. He took the time to listen to my history, which every doctor should.

I will definitely be coming back to this location, and see Dr. Emberland again!

The only drawback I can think of is the selection of Men's frames. It was very small, so not much to choose from.</text>< gmap_id>

<Review>Horrible customer service. I paid $760 for my glasses, and had a trial pair of contacts ordered. The receptionist tells me no appointment required to pick up glasses. So I go on in, and ask for my glasses. The girl tells me to sign in. I tell her I'm on my lunch break. apparently I can't pick them up because the optometrist has to be there and they are all at lunch! I can't even take my trial contacts. I drive across the valley because this was the only place I could get my original appointment. Anyway, I have wait because I got there close to the end of the optometrist lunch break. I sit there for 30 minutes. Finally I just had to leave very upset. The optometrist found it funny and says well you still have your appointment on Monday. So Monday comes I show early as usual. The receptionist tells me my appointment was cancelled. No room for me. Have to wait until next week. Can't accommodate me. Doesn't care about my situation. Just another damn person in her way. Glad to know I spent my money at this place that doesn't give a damn about me. Never going back. Just horrible service.</Review><time>1552322500649<//time></record>

They make sure you sign in with your arrival time and appointment time and then keep you waiting. Once they call your name and talk with a tech you they have to go to another waiting room and wait for the doctor. The doctors are fine and polite, but they have no respect for your time only there’s. I’m going to try a smaller clinic</text>< Pictures>

<username>Christy Hoehn</username><time>1593803709839</time><Rate>5< /Rate><text>While having an eye exam at MILAUSKAS, I was in real trouble.  He said what is the smallest line you can read.  I said “ A “ ( the big A at the top of the chart.)  My daughter who had accompanied me, let out a loud gasp “ Mom”!!. The optician, after more struggling to read ANYTHING, said : I have an idea your impaired vision this time might be caused by your cataracts worsening.  Let’s go see Dr. Ketover (his office was a few doors away). Well Dr. Ketover checked all aspects of my vision, and he concluded I needed cataract surgery- and so we scheduled cataract surgery.  Since around 3rd grade my vision had slowly all but disappeared.  In the old days, the coke- bottle bottom glasses, then they learned to make the lenses somewhat thinner, and then along came contacts.  Now in my 60s, I wore contacts AND glasses for reading, or bi- focals.  I had decided to get one new cataract- free for seeing up close, and one for far away which would still require wearing reading glasses. Well DR.KETOVER ( my HERO ) very gently suggested I get one eye for seeing up close, and one for distance.  I agreed with him .  I had my cataract surgery by DR. KETOVER ( one at a time ) and I can never find the right words to praise this Doctor. HE IS MAGNIFICENT!!! I NOW HAVE 20/20 VISION!!! He is a MASTER of this surgery.  I went from a little kid who saw only fuzz on trees, who had to have a special place in the classroom so I could be only a foot from the blackboard, and then given sight by various means until my 60s when my cataracts got very bad very fast. I THINK OF DOCTOR KETOVER EVERY SINGLE DAY. WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND DONT HAVE TO FUMBLE FOR MY GLASSES,  WHEN I CAN READ A LABEL WITHOUT FUMBLING FOR MY READERS. WHEN I GO TO BED AT NIGHT AND DONT HAVE TO SET MY EYESIGHT ON MY BEDSIDE TABLE AND HAVE ONLY DARKNESS LEFT.
I DONT BELIEVE ANY OTHER DOCTOR COULD DO THIS SURGERY SO PRECISELY THAT I HAVE PERFECT VISION. I REALLY DONT.  I HAVE VISITED HIM TO THANK HIM,  AND WAS READY TO DO SO AGAIN WHEN THE PANDEMIC HIT. HE HAS DONE SOMETHING I NEVER EVER BELIEVED POSSIBLE, AND I JUST CANT THANK HIM ENOUGH.  Being modest, he says he was just “ doing his job”, but it seems so much bigger than that to me.  I will visit him again when this illness is gone, and try  once again to express my gratitude, but it will never be enough. Thank you again Dr. Ketover!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>Everyone I have come in contact with at Milauskas Eye Institute is professional and welcoming. Dr Marshak was on time for my appointment and is quite personable. He explained in detail what was going on with my eye and what would be needed to fix it. He answered all my questions and did so without talking down to me and I did not feel rushed.

I would highly recommend Dr Marshak and the Milauskas Eye Institute.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

< Review>
Optometrist Luu is the best! I, like the responsible adult I am, didn’t realize that eye exams usually take about an hr and I failed to give myself enough time to do the exam and make it to work on time. When I realized this and relayed my situation to the receptionist she told me she’d talk to Luu and see if he could get me in and out quickly. She came back and said that they could accommodate me within my time frame no problem, which was very sweet of them. Needless to say it all worked out and this was probably one of my most pleasant eye exams ever. This is my 3rd time seeing Optometrist Luu and he is great at what he does. Professional and thorough (even under a slight time crunch) and a pleasure to be around. I used to dread my eye exams, but I never feel this way with optometrist Luu, he makes it a stress free experience every time and I leave happy with my prescription. He was also the first optometrist to share things with me like a speck in one of my eyes, which we watched for awhile and determined was just a freckle, but that was information that I hadn’t known prior. Thank you to the receptionist that helped me at the front desk and thanks optometrist Luu! I’ll definitely be back for all of my eye care needs!<//Review>

Greeted by the front desk with a smile. They are friendly and helpful.
Really liked my doctor, Dr. Anderson. He answered my questions and did not rush through the exam. Such a nice person.
Picking out glasses  always seems overwhelming. Kim was very helpful and made it a lot easier.
The La Quinta office has a good assortment of glasses.
The only negative is that the glasses are a bit more expensive than other places.
I highly recommend Milauskas Eye Institute.<//review>

The receptionist was well mannered, very friendly, very mature and conducted herself as a true professional.
The waiting area as well as the rest rooms were neat in appearance and extremely Clean.
The Doctor (Optometrist), who did my eye examination, was well educated,  very knowledgeable, well groomed,  fully mature, answered all my questions, advised me on the healthcare/status  of my eyes.  Most importantly I did not feel Rushed.
It is my professional opinion that the Receptionist and the Optometrist both receive a Meritorious promotion  with and increase in pay immediately.
It is high time that upper management start rewarding there staff, for a job WELL DONE.
BEST WISHES during the Holiday Season

I've been a very happy client of Milauskas Eye Institute for several years, but especially in the last 3 or 4 years.  That's because I have purchased some absolutely fabulous eye glasses with Coach frames!  The big, black frames are a fashion statement in and of themselves; but what has absolutely floored me are the countless compliments I regularly receive wherever I go.  That's been a really unexpected, but happily accepted, bonus!< /Review>

<text>Milauskas Eye Institute is a friendly and well run medical center.  Dr. Ketover, who is my Ophthalmologist, is one of the best.  He takes a concern for my well being and the health of my eyes that is reminiscent of Physicians of the past who took time to assess and you were not just a number.  He analyzes the health of your eyes, retina, etc and recommends what you might need to use for continued on going healthy eyes and retina.  He thinks outside the box.  Milauskas Eye Institute is lucky to have a Physician of his caliber.</text><gmap_id>0x80dafd4e9afee213:0x25536ccd5306c110<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I have been a patient for many years and I'm always looking forward to my annual eye examination! The staff is always pleasant, accommodating and friendly. The doctors are very professional and thorough during the examination and give you ample time to ask questions. The place is always clean and nicely decorated. I highly recommend Milauskas Eye Institute in Palm Springs!</review>

I saw Dr. Forest Murphy at the Rancho Mirage location for my initial appointment.  I had researched his background online and was impressed.  When I met him in the office I was further pleased with his warm manner, knowledge and allowing me to ask questions and make comments.  His wealth of experience will be very evident to all patients. I most highly recommend The Milauskas Eye Institute and Dr. Murphy.</Text>

I have been using Milauskas Eye Institute  at their La Quinta location for years with excellent results.  The location is fine for me and they are always agreeable and friendly when I go in.  Quite often I need some small adjustment with my glasses or questions to be answered and am treated with promptness and respect without  needing an appointment.  I have no problem recommending them to my friends.< /Review>

<Text>Milauskas Eye Institute is made up of some of the finest eye doctors that actually take the time to review your case and thoughtfully help you consider options, while explaining your results and diagnosis. Their chairside manner is wonderful. And, the front office staff, behind the counter and in the optical department are caring and very enlightening.  Rancho Mirage Milauskas, is Awesome!<//Text>< name>

Before driving three hours to this specialist; I provided my insurance information and confirmed the visit would be in network/ preventative. Two weeks later I received a bill for "my portion of the visit" over $330. I called them back and explained the pre -authorization and I was told the girl i spoke to doesn't work there anymore. I work in the finance industry so I paid the money just to insure my credit would not be adversely impacted but I feel strongly that they failed to bill correctly or grant me the consideration I deserve as a paying customer.</Text>

I have been a patient at the Milauskas Eye Institute for 28 years.  I would not consider going anywhere else for eye surgery, regardless of the need.  Everyone, from the employees at the reception desk to the surgeons are professional, caring and put you at ease.  It is obvious that they are will trained, not only medically, but also excel in the "people" business.  do not hesitate to make an appointment.</Review>

I saw Dr Adler and he is very well organized and caring.  However the front staff and hold time waiting for someone to help on the phone can be rather poor.  I'm my opinion if it takes someone 2 minutes to answer the phone and another 3 plus minutes on hold.  I hung up as it will take me less time to review this practice.<//review>

< Review>
I was a client for 13 years and had 4 or 5 major procedures, the last in April 2015.  They charged me for a follow up visit that I felt should have been included and "the billing supervisor" refused to delete a $40 charge after they had made thousands of dollars from procedures I had done there.    Very petty way to do business.  The whole ambiance there is cold and "Stepfordish", although there are some very kind and caring staff members.  I had to go to four different facilities in four valley cities for this one procedure.  Current and possibly new clients: BE FORE-WARNED!< /Review>

If you want great professional eye exams, excellent customer service, and the best selection of eyewear look no further than Milauskas. I've been their customer for over 15 years and would never go anywhere else. Their doctors are professional, courteous, and very thorough.< /text>

I find the staff at the Rancho Mirage office beyond helpful.  They are always cheerful and accommodating.  My doctor is thorough with his explanation of my medical condition and needs. The follow-up after surgery was precise and  left no questions unanswered.
I would highly recommend Milauskas Eye Institute and Dr. Ketover.

So I caught the receptionist not telling the truth. The doctor was in surgery in the morning until they called to say they had to change the afternoon appointment they moved it and they must have moved everybody else's so the waiting room was full I asked the receptionist
If they just dropped everybody into that slot and she said no but when the doctor came into the room she apologize for being so swamped and not being able to give enough time because they shoved all the patients into a short amount of time and she was already late for doing her later afternoon procedures. So ultimately I got last time when I would have preferred to have been rescheduled< /Text>

All of my experiences with the Milauskas Eye Institute has been exceptional.
Dr. Klair is out of sight - terrific! As was Dr. Hartzler before her.

If we could give no stars it would be more of an accurate description.  The Dr. I was seen by called me by the wrong name upon entering the exam room.  Had no idea why I was being seen and tried to diagnose an eye condition that I had when I was five that was taken care of when I was that age!!  I had to ask him three different times to please read my chart so that we could address the reason for my visit.  After all this, the prescription that was sent ( I provided the phone number to the pharmacy) was never sent and then once it was - was sent to the incorrect pharmacy.  My wife had to fight for this from 11:30, the time we left the office until 5:30 that night.  The pharmacy never received the prescription until she had to phone the office and yell at someone to send it over.  I had chemical burns in my eyes so this was what I would think would be an urgent matter.  If I didn't have to return because of the work related injury I would never step foot in this business and I HIGHLY recommend anyone else steering clear of this office!!< /text>

I have been treated by Milauskas Group for almost 20 years and have never had a single complaint.   Most recently I have been attended to by Dr. Ketover, who I deeply respect and admire.  I have also highly recommended Dr. Ketover and the Milauskas Group to many of my friends who are also very pleased.  Thank you, Mary Firmin.<//Review>

They still haven't given me my glasses and it has been far over the time they told me it would take. my experience has been awful. The doctors were great but their service ladies are all rude and unwelcoming and the people at the glasses section have made only mistakes so far. I hate it I do not recommend it to anyone</Review>

Horrible experience.  My ophthalmologist was not friendly, seemed spooked because I mentioned the recent death of my partner (male) from ALS. He was middle eastern and had NO personality.  He changed my prescription and it is incorrect.  The contacts I ordered and picked up from them give me blurry vision.  I just don't wear them.  My vision is in need of correction, but I will NOT go back to this Milauskas business, as he was homophobic (I am straight looking), unfriendly, curt, and most importantly:  incompetent.  They will never get a 2nd chance to make a good first impression on me...that was my first and LAST time Milauskas!  Quit calling me on the phone to get me back in there for this year, I DON'T want to hear from you!         Mack Rogers< /Text>

<review>I was a patient at the Milauskas Eye Institute in La Quinta and saw
Dr. Virginia Klair.  Dr Klair and her staff were so professional and
gave me personal help and attention.  I would highly recommend the
Eye Institute and especially Dr. Klair.

i have been a patient with the milauskas eye client for over 14 years i and have never had ANY problems. everything and everybody was TOTALY professional .
dr milauskas 5 years ago did  cataract surgery on my right eye. i am blind in my left eye and that made the surgery to my right eye extremely important. the surgery was beyond expectation.
i would and have recommended milauskas eye institute whenever possible.< /Text>

Have been going here for years but no more. Recently my wife went in for routine eye exam to update her prescription for contacts. She has worn hard lenses for over 50 years. For the past six months her eyes have been irritated from foggy lenses causing blurry vision. Repeated visits to correct the problem of defective lenses have done no good. Each time they insist on charging for a visit and refuse to replace the lenses. This place has been a revolving door for practitioners and staff. Terrible and expensive products and refusal to make things right.< /review>

I highly recommend Dr. Chane to friends and family. 5 years ago I was struggling to figure out what was happening with my heart. I wasn't able to play with my kids and go out with them. 5 years later, Dr. Chane has made a huge impact on my life. I am able to spend quality time with my family without having to worry about my heart. Dr. Chane and the entire staff are amazing. They do whatever it takes to make sure I get what I need. 12/10 would recommend!!< /text>

Always treated with the most professionalism. Always willing to go above and beyond. Awesome teamwork here. Came in for venous reflux and ulcers. Was treated right away and feeling so much better as ever. My son has special needs and they are so patient with him in his needs. The office is always so clean and the staff always greeted with a smile. Thank you California heart and Vein Specialists!</Text>

Dr. Chane is excellent, pleasant, knows his business and performs without issue.  The staff are dedicated individuals who are knowledgeable with their function and reliable to secure factual answers if they are unsure. There is no wait time in this office, every one is diligent in their jobs and responsive to the patient -- me. Prior to  seeing Dr. Chane I experienced severe leg cramps every night, to a point where I was unable to stand, for a few years.  After a series of four ablations  over 5 weeks, there is no more pain, I can sleep all night.  I  strongly urge anyone who is considering this procedure - see Dr. Chane.</text>

2 years ago, I came to Dr. Chane's office complaining of severe swelling in my pain and legs. Dr. Chane recommended that I do an ultrasound and then complete vein treatments. After spending countless hours at this office, I can speak to the patience and dedication of the staff. The results of the treatments speak for themselves.  I recommend Dr. Chane for your Heart and Legs!</Review>

I happen to feel my cardiologist is a great doctor. He still cares about his patients which I happen to love! I have trust issues with doctors but doctor Chane I trust with my heart ❤️! He’s a great doctor he explains everything to you so you fully understand what he’s going to do he honest and has a great bedside manner! All I can say is may God Bless Him!

<Text>I rotated in this clinic with a great intensive learning experience for one month. Dr. Chane and medical staffs provided me a good environment of learning. The nurse practitioners, Tina and Tiffany, are very knowlegable and warm as well.

This clinic provides nuclear stress test, echocardiogram, exercise stress test, leg vein ablations to patients, and Dr. Chane also do coronary angiogram in near hospitals, so it will be a great chance for you to experience cardiovasular medicine. Also, the variety of patients will give you an insight of practicing cardiology. It has been my honor to rotate in this place. I recommend this place for IM rotation.</Text><Date>1601081078854</Date></record></dataset><record>

Dr is very thorough and efficient.. Always very pleasant. Easy access to the office and the employees are great I love to watch the students doing  there  thing because there are new at it I can see some little mistakes they make they don’t know .
When I visit his office with some leg pain he gives me some advice and he seems to be right I’ll just go home and do what he says it works that ibuprofen.  Dr. Chane Is very accurate and knows what he’s doing.<//Text>

My father was told by various heart specialists and doctors that need to have a heart by pass surgery or open hear surgery which was extreme a tough decision for our family specially in this Covid-19 pandemic but when visited Dr. Chan, we were surprised and excited with the treatment process he brought up to our attention and we were proudly happy to gone through his preferred rout of treatment.

I highly encourage and recommend this practice and express my pleasure for every single individual who helped us during this critical condition.</text><rate>5<//rate>< time>

I have been a patient since 2008 and my experience with the physicians and staff is very positive.  Whatever the procedure happens to be, they walk you through the process and are very considerate with the patient.

Dr. Chan is very thorough and effective in what he does; I have the highest regard for him!

I highly recommend this office!

< Review>
My name is Miguel, and I am an Internal Medicine Resident (PGY-1 categorical) at Fairview Hospital of Cleveland Clinic, Ohio.
As an IMG and applicant to a medical residency training program here in the United States, I was looking for clinical rotations last year. I was fortunate to have found California Heart and Vein Clinic to rotate.

During my rotation through Dr Chane’s clinic, I learned how to put the theoretical concepts into the practice of cardiology. And beyond the clinical aspects, I also learned how to lead an exceptional healthcare team and to optimize time during busy schedules.

Academically, we reviewed and discussed journal articles on current progresses in cardiology, as well as topics presented in congresses like the World Congress of Cardiology and the European Society of Cardiology. I had access to the current issues of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC) and other resources. Dr Chane helped me fine-tune my presentation abilities and grasp the most important concepts of the topics presented. I had the opportunity to write an article about one of the topics I presented; Dr Chane reviewed the article and we submitted it to a medical journal. Another very remarkable aspect of my academical training during this rotation, was learning to read echocardiograms and nuclear cardiac imaging in order to make a diagnoses.

What an excellent experience it was to shadow Dr. Chane! It was critical for my matching. The outstanding letter of recommendation he gave me added significant weight to my application.

I invite applicants to a medical residency training program in the United States to come a rotate at California Heart and Vein Clinic.< /Review>

I wish I could give Dr. Chane 10 stars; everyone here is so lovely, professional, kind and respectful to the elders. Because of Dr. Chane's procedures on my legs, it has given me vast, incredible, extensive benefit to my abilities to function, exercise and enjoy my life. He has saved my legs and my health on multiple occasions. Dr. Chane's mannerisms and methods are always excellent, and respectful. The entire staff is so wonderful, the office extends respect dignity, kindness and concern to all patients. I have recommended my best friends and I would highly recommend anyone to come to this place, without a moment's hesitation, it will change your life for the better!</Review>

Just wanted to share my mom's experience with Dr. Chane in Huntington Beach, CA. My mom had heart surgery through Dr. Chane and has been treating her for a little over a year. Dr. Chane has made such a huge difference in my mom's life since her heart surgery and vein ablation on both legs and is now a completely different person with the success of her treatments. We are so grateful to Dr for helping my mom. She has a better quality of life now that she feels like a new person.</review>

Too bad there is only 5 stars to give because i would give this office a 10! Dr. Chane has patience with his patients. To release your stress he is very kind and comforting. especially when it comes to the Vein Ablations and Left Heart Cathereization Procedure. He's very concentrated in his work. He has great bed side manners. His Nurse Practitioners are wonderful.  The staff are very nice. i would recommend anybody to have Dr. Chane be your Cardiologist.</review>

I've been into the office only once, but I was impressed by the level of organization and careful attention given to me on my initial visit.  Gracious, efficient and complete. Everyone encouraged me, answered my questions, and went the extra mile to explain even with pictures.  It was much appreciated, after a heart attack that left me with more questions than answers.  Thank you all.<//Text>

I thank God for Dr. Chane and his complete team.  I am  not just a patient but I'm treated as family.  It is a great feeling to go to the doctor and not feel like your a commodity for the doctors personal gain.  The compassion and love Dr. Chane gives his patients really shows in his work.  I can not thank him enough for his integrity and love, because what i am going through is kind of scary.  Thank you</review>

<review>Dr. Chane was assigned as my dad's cardiologist at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital. He came to see him in such a rush and had no time to hear my dad's complaints. Unfortunately, we didn't have the experience everyone talks about. I wonder if going to his office would have in any way been different? I waited all day, literally from 7am-6:30pm for him to stop by and see my dad only to have what I consider as the 2nd to worst experience with a specialty doctor. For sure, we are NEVER going to seek his help again!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80dd26c7e7e7ca7d:0x6a7165136ed6a28b</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I was referred to Dr. Chane in May 2017 for Venous Reflux Disease in both my legs. Dr. Chane and his team of expert staff are amazing. They were very accommodating and I was able to get an appointment very quickly. On my initial consult, the doctor had ordered vein ablation treatments, and the staff had already received authorization for my upcoming treatments. Excellent Service! Dr. Chane has since performed 4 vein ablation procedures, and I am feeling great. The pain and swelling has gone down tremendously, especially with the help of the compression stockings recommended by Dr. Chane. I can see great change in my legs, they are looking and feeling back to normal again. I want to thank Dr. Chane and his team for treating me like family. I would highly recommend Dr. Chane as a Cardiologist. He is GREAT!!</text>

I am an IMG (International Medical Graduate) from China planning to apply for a residency program in the US. I was looking for an elective and thankfully I was introduced to Dr Chane. I've spent one month on his office with him and his team,i t has been such a rewarding experience.

First of all, I felt so welcome and also I could join the team of medical assistants and perform patient encounters, EKGs, and scribing, which helped me be familiar with the medical system and practice the CS skills. Dr Chane has an enormous experience in the treatment of chronic
insufficiency and heart disease, which gave me a great opportunity to appreciate Dr Chane's expertise and improve my knowledge regarding Cardiology. Also, stuffs like Alexis and Trinh in office are friendly and helped me a lot, without them, I may not be able to join the team and do my job. It was a great experience and I sincerely recommend it for every IMG that needs friendly oppportunities to improve his/her clinical skills.<//Text>

In addition to that, he is very clear and straightforward with his explanations and took all steps to make sure I was comfortable.

I came in with severe leg pain for months to the point that i couldn't even drive. I found Dr. Chane and he told me there was a cure called Vein Ablation treatments. They got me in right away and getting this problem taking care of. I got all my treatments within 4 weeks. i feel 85-90% better than i expected, a big improvement from when i first came in.

<Text>I am a 49 yr old male that found Dr. Chane for my legs. My legs were very swollen and it was difficult to get around. Dr. Chane did a treatment Called Vein Ablations. After all of my treatments I noticed a huge change in my legs. I feel 10 x better than I did before. My wife had even noticed the difference. It has not only recovered the health to my legs but also, it will provide me with an overall better health condition. The staff in the office are really professional with all that they do. They're a great team while working together. I definitely recommend this office to all people who suffer from blood circulation problems.<//Text>< user>

<Gmap_id>0x80dd26c7e7e7ca7d:0x6a7165136ed6a28b<//Gmap_id><text>I arrived on time for a 9:00 follow up appointment with Dr Chane. No one else was waiting. At 9:15 Dr. Chane's assistant came in from the outside through the lobby.  At 9:30 I was called in.  The questions the nurse asked me clearly show they do not look at your chart or history, they are just going down a list and most questions are not even relevant to my situation.
At 9:45 Dr. Chane's assistant comes in and asks me why my blood pressure is a little higher than normal.  I told her I was upset for having to needlessly wait for 45 minutes. I asked whywas I booked for a 9:00 appointment when the staff wasn't even there?  She said she is just an employee and Dr. Chane wasn't even there at the time so if I had an issue I should take it up with him.  She told me that based on my test results they would need to resubmit to my insurance.  Why did they make me come in, charge me for an appointment, make me wait and then give me no useful information?  All this could have been done by phone or e-mail. I am a person, not a checklist and customer service matters.< /text><rate>2< /rate>< username>

Best cardiology office I have ever been to. The staff are very attentive and show a great deal of compassion. I especially like the M.A. that does vein ablation and Nuclear Stress test. He has great taste in football teams as well as headphones.</Review>

<review>I am an IMG (International Medical Graduate) from Brazil planning to apply for a residency program in the US. I was looking for an externship and thankfully I was introduced to Dr Chane. I've spent one month on his office with him and his team. It has been such a rewarding experience. First of all, I felt so welcome and also I could join the team of medical assistants and perform patient encounters, EKGs, and stress tests. Dr Chane has an enormous experience in the treatment of chronic insufficiency and performs many procedures like vein ablation and phlebectomies, which were new for me. The best part for me was the discussion of patient's cases because it was a great opportunity to appreciate Dr Chane's expertise and improve my knowledge regarding Cardiology. It was a great experience and I sincerely recommend it for every IMG that needs friendly oppportunities to improve his/her clinical skills.< /review><rate>5< /rate>< username>

<review>Took my parents there for regular check ups and heart tests. Dr. Chane is not only very experienced, but also very comforting when communicating with his patients. He takes his time explaining medical procedures, illnesses, and symptoms. The staff is professional, responsive, and very helpful, always with a smile.

<text>My mom had a great experience with Dr. Chane. She was seen by another cardiologist before seeing Dr. Chane but did not feel better. Through another doctor we met Dr. Chane. One thing I like about Dr. Chane office is his office is fully equipped for heart related patients. His staffs are very friendly and polite. My mom felt much better after ECP. After the phlebectomy, my mom no longer experience swelling of the legs. I highly recommend Dr. Chane.

Dr. Chane listens to me for everything. He never rushes the patient to finish and he gives me advice for all health related questions. He has been with me for 4 years and even did my angiogram in 2014 and another one recently. It went very well and I have no side effects or pain. I definitely recommend Dr. Chane.</review>

<Text>The cashiers here and the supervisor of the self checkout lanes are honestly so rude - and especially and only to people of color. Moreover, they always seem impatient with customers and when people need assistance at self checkouts, we have to patiently wait for the employees to finish their conversations. I once saw a lady try to interrupt them and get help at the self checkout station and the blonde worker literally raged at her during work. Unacceptable service, these people at the checkout lines need training.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< GmapID>

< Review>
The supermarket was fine ,I went threw self checkout for the reason being ,, The staff and not all of the staff but the majority if them were rude and not helpful  in any way im sure that corporate does not tolerate any such thing so that's the reason for my bad review.. Management do something..<//Review>

Their deli and salad bar section is always stocked and fresh. They're "butcher" section has a variety of marinated meat, chicken and seafood to choose from.  A big selection of organic food and ready to eat packs.

A good selection of beer and wine, but they are not BevMo.  Pricing can be competitive, but don't count on bargain pricing.

The flower department has a big fresh selection of flowers and it's always staffed for custom bouquets.

Finally don't forget the Asian section with a variety of popular trendy and current Asian food. Again, the price can be competitive, but do not count on finding bargains.<//Text>< Pics>

Great staff.  Great grocery store.  They do their best to stay in stock.  Jamba Juice is delicious.  Their habanero baked chicken is delicious.
Their Panda Express is better than all the Panda Express locations, for some reason.  I'm saying this as someone who doesn't like Panda Express. 😁</text>

<review>I love this location. It's my local grocery store. I love the staff! And it is usually stocked when I go in the morning. I think they're doing the best they can during these trying times.

This review is for the pharmacy only.  Ms. Like What, the pharmacy clerk either has limited English, or is indifferent for providing ANY customer service.  She has no idea what I was saying, or was NOT listening AT ALL!  Upon obtaining my prescription, she told me "wait for 30 minutes".  I asked politely, "would you please check whether you have it first?". I was then informed that they need to order it and have me pick it up on Monday.  Then she went to the inside counter and started doing other things.  I waited until she saw me again and said "I told you the pick up date is Monday, just call before you come".  I was very uncomfortable and asked "would you please set me up for the text alert?"  She said yes and went to do something else again.  I stood at the counter for another 3 minutes until she noticed me and said something again.  I reminded her that I am still waiting for her to set me up.  She finally did after a total of about 10 minutes.  I have done similar processes at other branches of Vons and it took less than 2 minutes, they really need to ramp up their customer service quality!</text>

Vons is a very nice Market but it costs more than the competition generally. Their customer service is first-rate so that helps to offset part of the cost Factor.</Review>

<Review>This place is ok for what itis now.  Selection and services is fine. The reason for this rating is what they are compared to what they were. Before, they were Pavilions. They are still the same company but it was so much more special. They use to treat people special and were more outgoing and friendly. That really made a difference and I notice it. All stores could be alot more but itisnotdueto store policy and training. Too Bad. Loyalty goes both way and is earned.<//Review>< username>

<text>This place is completely anti Mexican I walked in to buy Panda Express and the service there was very good but upon walking out I was being followed by staff as if I was stealing something. They made me feel very uncomfortable and I didn’t even notice it until my wife and daughter pointed it out. Is this what America is?? I’m an America citizen and pay my taxes.

<text>My 5⭐'s is for the wonderful Bakery Department...Christina and Peggy were an 'Absolute Joy" to talk and ask all my questions to!
Thanks ladies! It's employees like you who keep customers like me coming back to your Vons...I come from El Monte area for your delicious Bagles! Fresh daily,and those jalapeno and cheese bagels are AMAZING,covered with tons of cheese and plenty of jalapenos,and their opens at 6am!
This Vons Bakery is Awesome! With a beautiful store, inside they have a Starbucks, Panda Express, and many other places inside that I can't even think of right now... but it's an awesome Vons! 🎉 Fresh produce,flowers and plants,stuffed animals balloons cards...they sell  everything you want for a birthday gift...a great Deli with fresh hot soups and I just LOVE their bakery!
A must try if your ever in Arcadia!<//text>< Pictures>

Nice. Clean store. Plenty of parking spaces.  Prices may not be the lowest compared to other (Asian or Mexican) markets nearby, everything appears sparkly  clean here. P.s. friendly staff, too.<//text>

< Review>
Full service Vons.  Dry clean, lotto, Wells Fargo, Panda Express, Starbucks, Jamba juice, seafood, butcher (no stench), fast food counter,  plenty of karts, parking reasonable with cover parking available, decent size liquor department, lots of manager specials, dining areas,  all one stop. Slightly dated decor that could use some skylights, otherwise ideal grocery market.  wishing every location would live up to this standard.< /Review>

Fairly large newer-style Vons with many extra departments, even a drive through pharmacy. Parking is free but can be crowded at busy times. You pay for the large variety in prices that are not great overall. Sale prices can be good if you use a Club card account and the Vons app. Best to shop here if you plan what to buy before you visit. Staff are helpful when asked.</Review>

<review>If I could give a ten (10) star I would. From the moment you walk into the store you know the experience will be fantastic. Smells good, floors shine, shelves are full, bread is baked, people are friendly... Not a fake friendly but honest to goodness Customer Service friendly.   You guys are wonderful, plus the Sushi is the best and FRESH.  THANK YOU.<//review></record>

Love this store...they have the best fried chicken.  None if the other Vons I've tried make it like they do.  Very convenient packs of ready chopped fruits and veggies for the busy working customer.  And the prices are good too!< /Text>

Terrible cashier, rude attitude. Woman cashier at 15 items over must had a bad day, she was unprofessional and ready to explode with mean attitude because I didn't have Vons club card. I'm saying sorry and all that, but she is continously getting mad and being annoy.  My over 100 times shopping experiences at Ralph's have always encounter superb cashiers. I will try best not to shop at Vons again</text>

<Text>I've been to this location 4 times within 24 hours. Each time I was able to successfully purchase items. It's confusing because they have a sign on a side of the building without any doors. There is also a panda Express within the location. They mostly sell grocery items, but other items can also be purchased here. Prices are mid to high range.< /Text>< Pictures>

< review>
Vons is actually a great supermarket. They have a deli, hot food case, sandwich deli area, prepackaged foods from the deli, fresh produce, organics, a florist, dry cleaner, lotto vendor, Jamba juice, panda express, Starbucks, sushi makers, pharmacy, bakery +++ this store is very clean and the staff can be friendly. There are some grouchy people but not enough to discourage me from visiting this store. You can actually get flowers cheaper at trader Joe's than you can here. From what I heard the pharmacy is kind of pricey. Also the parking lot is absolutely the worst feature. Be extra careful because it can be hazardous with people not paying attention. That said, I use to live around the corner and always walked to Vons. My biggest criticism is that they never replaced their bike rack. It was destroyed by a driver and ultimately removed. So if you're thinking about stopping in it is worth it. Try a low flow hour because they no longer have their self check out and peak times are crazy with long lines. My favorite items are the carousel ice cream cakes and the giant hello kitty balloons.<//review>

I used to love shops at Pavilion. Ever since Albertsons bought it! Everything not the same anymore. I thought I'm the only person who felt the difference, my co-workers said they're shopping at Vons or Pavilion as well!<//Review>

<text>I used to love shops at Pavilion. Ever since Albertsons bought it! Everything not the same anymore. I thought I'm the only person who felt the difference, my co-workers said they're shopping at Vons or Pavilion as well!< /text>< Pics>

<review>I was in the store that I have shopped in, almost exclusively since it opened, years ago.  There was a woman ahead of me who came back to the lane I was in, in front of me, to take issue with a price she was charged for some meat.  The two packages were obviously different, probably from different providers.  I get that, but this lady didn't, or appeared not to understand, and was determined to get the better price.  After much confusion with several employees involved, including a manager, the woman got what she wanted.  What I and the people behind me in line got was very a long wait.  I came very close to leaving my groceries, and just walking away.

My question,  what is the customer service desk for???  Any time I have had issue with a purchase, that is where I have been told to go.  My time was of no value here and I have had it happen too many times.  I will be a customer of the Pasadena Ralphs store from this point.<//review>< name>

Vons is a large grocery store chain with a wide variety of items carrying all the major national brand name items, prices vary week to week so consult either the Vons website or weekly add, in addition to it's large grocery selection you can also have lunch at the panda express or grab a beverage from either Starbucks or Jamba juice all located inside the store.</Review>

<text>This has got to be one of the most versatile grocery stores that I have ever been to. I mean, they have a Panda Express, a Jamba Juice, a Starbucks, an amazing deli, a bakery, and more! It's crazy. All the staff that I've encountered here are incredibly polite and the store itself is really clean. They even have bag carryout service for those who are physically impaired. All around this is a great store.< /text>< pics>

My favorite Von's Pavillions! Very clean. Very customer service oriented. Friendly and great service by cashiers, deli and bakery, and all other departments. Feels like small town hospitality.  Great specials on Friday!</Text>

One of the bigger Vons store. Used to be Pavilion and they rebranded / downgraded to Vons. The store still have Panda Express, hot rotisseries, hot meats, Starbucks (with chairs, tables and sofas), dry clean and Jamba Juice. The store are nice and clean. Many different kind of fruits and vegetables. .  Staff are friendly but checkout could be ling wait.</Review>

<Text>Great deals sometimes, but food can be pricey in comparison to cheaper stores. It's really clean and they have good selections for standard american foods. They have their own little overpriced asian section which is kinda good if you're in a rush.<//Text>< Date>

Very friendly cashiers and manager.

The deli section took a bit longer to serve me than I'd like. Wholefoods and trader Joe's will give you more attentiveness but it's not too bad here.

Manager here will go above and beyond for you!<//text>

I'm not from around here, passing through visiting California. First time in this store (no Vons in Illinois) and I the cashier was too busy texting on his Facebook messenger to pay attention to me. On 3 different occasions he stopped ringing my items so he can write on the messenger app. Great first impression.< /text>

Love this Pavillion (now back to Vons). Selections of different foods; fresh bread, grade a meats and veges. Pharmacy is helpful and reasonably quick. Also love the options of Jamba Juice and Starbucks in the store. The only two complaints are lack of self service check out lines which it used to have and wait time to drop off and pick up dry clean since they lump this service with lotto/returns/cashier checks. Favorite employee is mr. Mohammed.<//text>

Relatively clean store, nice and accommodating staff. Wide variety of goods at a fair price. Only problem is lack of cashiers at times.

Theres also a starbucks inside even though theres another (official) starbucks right next door to it.< /review>

Most and any other store would have them at the far side or even at the back of the store. So, when I come it, it just feels nice, healthy and open - it doesnt feel crowded at all.
I have been coming in to this store for about a 3 years now, and a lot has changed.
I love that they accept google and apple pay. You can also use those means to pay for your orders at their in-house Jamba Juice and Starbucks. PROTIP: you can pay for your groceries from these outlets, too.
The only one disappointing thing they did which i had wished they kept were the self check out counters; because most of the time, i just go in for 1 or 2 things, and i didnt have to wait in like to pay. These supposed express checkout lanes that replaced the self checkout counters are empty most of the time, and it appears that its just a place to keep returned items to be placed at the end of the day. So, what should just be a quick pick up, becomes several minutes waiting in line at a counter for someone to finish counting change to pay in exact amount.

Other than that, the manager is very friendly when i had inquired about a favorite drink they havent restocked - they restocked it!! - and it sells out fast. - they however havent been restocking or having the party tray mini rolls or the croissants anymore, which is my most frequent buy from there a couple years back, but still - their fresh items are great, and its conveniently surrounded by other shops where you can eat, drink or shop at while a friend or family member is restocking your home's supplies.< /review>< Pics>

Sushi late after 7p tastes nasty The rice is gard,and staked. Raw fish is old, avocado is black. Mostly i cant return sushi sp better taste first before pay for it. Afc sushis not cheap so if ypu buy nasty okne that cant be eayen, thr ow away costs 15 bucks! Just put it back for them. After 7p I'm surprised they still sell those old sushi at regular price!
Rip off sushi place

Other than bad overrated sushi and some fake over priced organic fruits and vegetables, they're ok.</text>

<Review>Store is split with aisles on the left and right and produce, restaurants, meat and deli in the middle.  It makes it confusing because food aisles are on both sides, so unless you know the layout of the store, you can find yourself walking back and forth to find what you need. Long lines in the evening and and short lines in the morning, normally. Weird Vons store as it has a Starbucks, Jamba Juice, and Panda Express inside.</Review>< name>

Very poor. I know it is Saturday afternoon but really not a 16.9 oz. Diet Pepsi in the store,  the  buy 4 ads were out or unmarked,  even the produce was picked over! Plus to get a rain ckeck you have to go clear over to customer service & wait for someone to show up to write it for you. I'm a regular shopper at the store & have noticed lack of service decline & right now I don't care if I ever go back.< /text>

<Time>1622407430406<//Time><text>(Translated by Google) Compatriots be careful! There are racists among the salespersons in this shop. They have treated the Chinese people badly during the epidemic. They deliberately find faults, treat the Chinese people who are queuing to check out like driving animals, and even deliberately throw my invoices on the ground. Nearby Chinese residents try not to go shopping here, there is no need to spend money to buy humiliation. I have thrown away my membership card, there is no need to go again.

(Original)
同胞小心！此店营业员中有种族主义分子，在这个疫情时期对待中国人态度恶劣，故意找茬，像是驱赶动物一样对待排队结账的中国人，甚至故意把我的发票扔在地上。附近中国人居民尽量不要去这里购物，没有必要去花钱买屈辱。我已经扔掉了我的会员卡，没必要再去了。<//text><pics>None<//pics>< user_id>

(Translated by Google) The v0ns supermarket is a good place to shop. Lots of products are also very clean. Panda Express, Starbucks coffee shop, flower shop, etc. are all in the business. A variety of operations are convenient for customers. The cashier ’s friendly attitude gives me an impression. it is good.

(Original)
v0ns超市是个购物的好地方，货品很多也很清洁还有熊貓快歺、星巴克咖啡店、花店等都在内营业，多种经营，方便了顾客，收銀员的态度友善，给我的印象很好。<//Text>
