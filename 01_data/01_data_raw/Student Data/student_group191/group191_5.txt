This company charges an unreasonable convenience fee to pay by credit card.  It seems that it should be more convenient for them to receive electronic payment so why am I being charged.  Ripoff<//review>

I have had nothing but a good experience here.the staffing in the leasing office and resident office always seem to go above and beyond for all residents and the maintenance staff response time is always either the following day,or shortly thereafter when submitting a maintenance chit.

The staffing here is constantly at work trying to come up with ways to treat their residents to some type of activity,big or small,and strive to make it feel more like a community then just a building complex.< /Text>

If I could rate these apartments everyday I would. Let’s start with the amount of times the actual fire alarm goes off for no reason a month. Or how management is ran by the same young college students who live here. So u know they don’t gaf about ur complaints. They have been saying for 3 months now they were going to put water in the pool and haven’t. Maintenance dgaf either so don’t waste ur time.</Text>

<review>Rats everywhere! Saw a rat running in the hallway on the first day I moved in. I ignored it because I thought I won’t affect me anyway because I live on the fourth floor. But starting from 4 months ago, I can hear the rats running  around either on my ceiling, in air conditioner, and on top of my bathroom. Today, I even saw a rat running in my kitchen and even a dead one appears in my toilet! I tried to ask for help but does not works out at all.

< Review>
This is the last place I would recommend anyone live. The staff is very unresponsive and very unhelpful when they do respond. The amenities have been closed using COVID as an excuse (despite staying closed when restrictions were lifted). The shuttle to SDSU, which is a main amenity because they cater to SDSU students, is unreliable and cancelled randomly with no notice in the middle of the day. When this happens, staff has no care for the inconvenience of leaving students stranded on campus and offers no help. A direct quote I got when asked if they could do anything to get me back home from campus after canceling the shuttle in the middle of the day: “You can walk, or buy your own Uber.” This was after the waiting 30minutes on hold while the marketing manager was supposedly trying to get me an Uber home. I guess when it got too difficult or inconvenient for them she just changed her mind.
Other concerns are messes, noise, and trash. Often there’s trash left in hallways and stairwells for days or weeks at a time. There’s a policy for not leaving trash bags out before 6pm, but it’s not enforced. There are loud neighbours hosting parties, despite the no party rule in the lease, and security doesn’t make any effort to break them up, despite calls of complaint because management won’t enforce the no parties rule until after “quiet hours”.
Overall, not profession, dirty, no value, and no care for residents or resident concerns. I’m sure I’ll get a response to this review saying to send my concerns to management, but that’s in bad faith seeing as the management are the ones who have directly caused most of my problems.</Review>

At first the apartments were nice and fun. But then office started coming up with BS rules and started forcing people to pay for other people’s rent (despite them saying that a new rule meant this tear everyone was only held accountable for their own rent). Also there's a RAT PROBLEM and the office will not do a single thing  about it. So you are paying way to much  for a mediocre product and experience. These apartments were awesome two years ago but they have gone downhill fast. Would not recommend these apartments.< /Text>

Would give negative stars if I could. The management has no idea of contract law. The contract is only valid once both parties sign. Up until that point, it's invalid as per their writing in the agreement. I notified Blvd63 prior to them signing that I need to withdraw the contact. Juan, Casey and Amanda kept on repeating that we needed to find someone to take over the lease and we're bound to it. After several months and endless emails of me getting ready to pursue them legally,they finally voided the contract. I think their business practices are shady and unethical and I would stay FAR away from this place. If I didn't know my rights, they would of continued to lie and take advantage of me. My persistence and knowing rental laws are the only way I was able get out. STAY AWAY!<//Review>

There was usually no one around and anyone could have gotten in to the parking garage. It gets loud on weekends too! There's a security company that is there overnight, but doesn't do much about the noise. The guys in the leasing office were much nicer than the ladies.

Management in this place is a joke, it’s run by children that have leadership issues as well as lack of respect and initiative in order to accommodate the residents. The grills and the pool must be open. I moved here for the pool and grill as well as to use the gym but instead of looking for solutions they eat popcorn and use the gym for themselves(the office’s management) and not attend the residents when trying to contact them. For the price they’re charging and to have to deal with RATS & gang related activities as well as disrespectful teenagers I don’t think is not worth it the price.< /text>

< Review>
Blvd 63, if it was possible to leave no stars I would. It has a group of dishonest employees that work for them. They sign leases for people who have no income, tell you they don’t even run credit checks, lie about fees and lies about communications they have with tenants. Homeless people break into apartments and nothing is done. People throw up in the hallways, people punch holes into the walls and they are left for months. Whoever does their accounting makes errors, and then wants to not own any responsibility to that error when confronted with the proof of those errors. You call the number asking for cooperate and they refuse to give you the information to complain to someone above them. Completely unprofessional and would never lease from them. Run fast away from this place. Anywhere is better than here!!!< /Review>

Don’t live here, probably one of the worst mistakes you could make. The management is a joke and are just here to try to nickel and dime you for whatever they can. Tried to charge me 2,000 for a busted rubber pipe and got caught in a lie about the damages so had to drop it down to 1,000. Lmao this place is a joke.

< review>
I wanted to share our great experience at Blvd63 last month when we moved our daughter in to her new apartment. We live on the Central Coast, so we spent the Thursday of move-in weekend driving down to San Diego. On the way, our daughter found out that her 3 future roommates had been relocated due to an unfortunate experience with a homeless person. She was devastated by this news and unsure of what her experience there would be. The next morning, when we went to move in, we met Jacob, the Assistant Executive Director, who, for the next couple of hours, treated us like we were the most important people in the world! He made every effort possible to make sure our daughter found a more-than-suitable apartment situation. It was unexpected, but so very much appreciated! Thank you, Jacob, for making our first experience at Blvd63 a wonderful one!! - The Brauns</review>

When I went into the apartments, there were people partying all over the place and trash strung everywhere. I tried going into the residents office to get a sense of what the apartment was like and a man named Jacob (Maybe Kreb? When I asked for his name he realized I wanted to report him and ran away)  said I was clearly a homeless immigrant from Asia and was asked to leave. I was horrified because I wasn't homeless and i actually wanted to rent an apartment. I told him I wasn't even Asian and he said how could I know I can barely see through my eyes. I'm horrified and can only imagine what living there is like. 0/10 would not go there again!!< /review>

TAKE PICTURES OF EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU LEAVE!! Staying at BLVD was quite nice for the most part (even with the CONSTANT smoke alarms and evacuations), well up until the end that is.. We left the place spotless, about as clean as it was when we moved in. Just found out that we were charged $150 for losing ONE key fob, $100 for carpet cleaning (we vacuumed and carpets were stainless), $115 for cleaning (we mopped and wiped EVERYTHING), and $65 for paint (a piece of tape peeled less than a square inch of paint off of the wall.

Worst apartment complex in San Diego.  It may look like they have cool amenities but it doesn't matter because they're not up kept. If there were employees other than children responsible for the well being of the tenants maybe this place would be more habitable. As much as I love that anyone can get away with anything in this apartment complex it would be nice to have the staff make any concerns a priority. The ice maker doesn't work, the sink is broken and now the shower and all water faucets shoot out dirty water in intervals, but don't worry they'll get to it never. Thanks blvd I didn't want to drink water or shower. If I could give half a star I would.< /Text>

I’m hopeful that the following maintenance issues will be fixed that were there on move- in day:

Back outside security gate is off its hinges
Security gate that opens to 63rd Street is also off the hinge.

There are chains and locks on two of the three exits to the main pool. The large jacuzzi was broken and cold.

All of the hallway carpets were badly stained as if someone with a leaking oil drum rolled it up and down everywhere.

In one of the private study rooms, someone had peed and it smelled awful. Particularly because it was hot and air conditioning wasn’t working.

Considering they are getting about $5,000 a month per each shared apartment, th maintenance should be impeccable, particularly in move in day.<//review>

This is my second year living at Blvd63 and each day I feel more and more at home. This complex does such a great job of creating a close community within a bigger community, and it has made living away from family such an easy transition. From their community events, facilities, and staff care, I've always felt really welcomed. The amenities are really great and the staff does a good job of maintaining the property, which makes me proud to live here. I will probably live here another year because my experience has been so positive.< /Review>

Pictures on the website are similar to pictures of people on Instagram.
The reality is super disgusting carpet floors, also carpet in the bed rooms, which are super unhygienic. The majority of the clients are still in their puberty and party 3-4 times a week. Gym is also super dirty and almost every 2. machine is broken since I am arrived 4 months ago. The hot tub is full of dirt and since I am here I saw it 2. times cleaned, after a bath you will have a strong smell.
Location is close to SDSU, but you see police activities almost every day. Last week were a guy with a gun in the apartment. Also almost everyone are just entering the building.
This would be still okay, because you can meet awesome people here, but which annoyed me at the most, are the „work system“ of the stuff. My first contract couldn’t be handled out and took almost 1 month. Then some employees (blond girl) have zero motivation to work, they just hang around in the office and talking to co workers. They don’t try to find a efficient solution, you will realize there laziness. That is really disappointing.</Text>

My first year living at BLVD63 has been nothing but amazing!!! BLVD63 portrays the perfect San Diego lifestyle with all its great amenities such as a resort style pool, multiple BBQs, a clubhouse full of fun activities, and a wonderful and friendly staff. I'm excited to start my second year living in paradise! Thank you BLVD63 for making my college years so memorable!!!<//text>

<Review>I do not recommend living here at all. The list of problems with this facility is extensive and the lack of accountability on their end is inexcusable. To begin with the complex itself, the lack of security from the broken gates surrounding the building, to the weak security personnel causes tenants to feel unsafe and unguarded. Due to this, there are homeless and shady suspects traveling in and out of the premises. Considering this is a majority college-aged living facility, young people deserve to know they are living in a protected environment. Moreover, the staff here is extremely unprofessional. The leasing advisors and maintenance workers make advances on young women seeking residence and female tenants living here. It makes girls uncomfortable and it is unnecessary. On top of that, in the leasing process, the staff uses false advertising as a tactic to lure people into signing new leases and renewing. For example, people who have renewed have been promised lump sum visa gift cards, complimentary HBO subscriptions, a new and a remodeled workout facility, all of which HAVE NEVER been fulfilled. Even more, many residents who live here attend the nearby community college whose semester began earlier than SDSU. Due to this, the leasing staff was promising an early move-in date. Many of these residents double and triple checked with resident services beforehand to confirm this agreement, however, after people had already arrived in town prepared to move-in, they were left without anywhere to stay. NUMEROUS residents ended up without housing and had to pay their hard-earned money to find a place to sleep. This was the fault of poor administration and a lack of sympathy. Also, for those of us who would like to recycle we no option as the trash and recycling are both taken into the same dumpster. This place has thousands of tenants and this large amount of waste is very damaging. In addition, to all of this, the price of living in a place like this is largely outrageous in comparison to the lackluster reality behind the glamourous marketing scheme. Furthermore, the price of the single bedrooms within the beach cruiser and vdub style apartments are the same among the apartment and yet the square footage is obviously VERY different. In the Vdub, my roommate and I both pay $1,046 and yet my room and closet are about 2/3 the size of the other. A smaller room should be a lower price, and tenants should have the option to pay more or less depending on the size of their room.  Moreover, on move-in day I know numerous people who had been moved into rooms with bedbugs, broken windows, dirty kitchens, cigarette aromas, and large piles of trash in the common walkways, all of which are unacceptable from a complex that boasts on luxury living.  I am writing this, not to be mean, but to suggest that anyone considering signing onto a lease here thinks twice. BLVD63 seems that its only concern is the money, and shows very little concern for the actual living conditions. Until they change their ways and listen to these complaints and actively make changes to their poor management style, no one should consider living here.</Review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1567703409641, 'text': "Alyssa, please accept our sincerest apologies for what definitely sounds like an uncomfortable and frustrating series of events.

BLVD 63 Units are located 20 min walk away from SDSU. However, you can also use public transportation to get there in 15 - 20 minutes. The blvd 63 apartment complex is exceptionally close to CVS pharmacy and affordable supermarket - Smart and Final Extra.
Communication: ✧ 5/5 ✧
I want to thank Eli Deventurero for being the amazing owner-operator of the apartment complex and for supporting and helping us before and during our stay there.
Cleanliness: ✧ 5/5 ✧
Living room, bedrooms, baths, gym, halls, garden, both pools, jacuzzi, and even trash rooms were spotless. There were several leaves in the pools, but that's understandable because the pools are quite big and are surrounded by palm trees and other plants.
Comfort: ✧ 5/5 ✧
Everything worked flawlessly in the unit. Wifi speed was extremely high. The living room and bathrooms were equipped with all the necessities such as towels, cleaning solutions, shampoo, soap, etc ...
Overall: ✧ 5/5 ✧ - exceptional and affordable place to stay, especially if you are studying or doing research at SDSU.<//Text>< Resp>

DO NOT LIVE HERE!!! Attention all parents and college students. BLVD63 might appeal on the outside as a fun place to live, they even trademark their apartments as “Living in paradise. Do not fall for this! They are scam artists, they know how to market to the younger demographic. I’ve lived here for the past two years, for someone who’s been here long enough I’ve seen some terrible changes throughout time. I will begin to list off some of these horrifying changes.

FIRST of all, their contract is terrible and unreliable. It’s on a joint lease, what happened with our particular situation was two of our roommates that were  LEGALLY on the lease decided they didn’t want to pay rent and left. We were startled at this, and of course trying to cover two people’s rents as college students is incredibly frustrating and difficult. We went down to the residents building helplessly trying to figure out something we can do. The property manager was very rude and cold like and simply replied to us saying “Well it’s a joint contract you guys signed it.” DO NOT LIVE HERE BC IF SOMEONE LEAVES, YOU WILL BE PENALIZED BEWARE THE CONTRACT TERMS!!

SECONDLY, SAFETY. As a woman you have to be extra cautious when walking around day/night. This area isn’t the best and there have been multiple times I have been approached by a couple homeless people in the area. If you care about your daughters/sons safety then please pick another area of San Diego, there are better neighborhoods to live in. ANOTHER THING... my  roommate  and I were walking in the halls of BlVD 63, and there was a HOMELESS MAN IN A STORAGE UNIT!!! We caught a glimpse of him and ran to our apartment. YOU would think you could be “safe” in your own apartment however, that’s not the case. I have felt that my safety has been multiply compromised.

THIRDLY, the security doesn’t do anything, there are always random people using the amenities we are paying for at BLVD63. The gym, the pools, the hot tub, the study rooms. There are numerous kids/people in the area that take advantage of these apartments and the tenants and use the amenities that are rightfully ours. Another thing, the doors are always broken and they seem to never fix them for weeks, they say they have maintenance, but where are they? Thats why anyone can come into BLVD63. The parking garage is never regulated by staff either.. cars have been broken into, things have gotten stolen. I know multiple people who have gotten their vehicles stolen as well.

FOURTHLY, THE STAFF!!! The staff is probably the most inexperienced, unprofessional, unpleasant, and most unprepared employees I have ever encountered. They have “lost” my roommates and I’s cashiers checks, and checks for rent. How could you be so irresponsible when handling that much money? Hire some professional people with experience not only is our parents at stake but we are to. I also don’t like how BLVD63 will literally charge you for anything, I’m sure I won’t ever get my security deposit back but if they even try charging us for one more thing, I will not be paying it.

To wrap up this review, ( I know it’s long) I wish I could rate BLVD63 a 0. My experience here has been very unpleasant and I’m really glad I get to move out and begin a stress free life in a few days. Please take my review into consideration, if you want to live here then you’re in luck because now they’re leasing by the bed. Right after the screwed over my parents, and me, and everyone else living in the apartment. We had to pay thousands of dollars each month to them and it’s still not enough. Also, beware of they’re “promotions” if you renew with them they offer bogus gift cards but you’ll actually never get them.. because there will ALWAYS be a reason why. They are master scam artists and they know how to appeal to a younger crowed. Don’t be naive, I hope everyone reads this there are better places to live in San Diego and I am so passionate about sharing my story to other young minded individuals likes me. I’ll make my story heard.< /review>

Worst apartment I have ever rented! Terrible & unfriendly staff, terrible, crazy, and dangerous residents! I recommend you stay anywhere else in San Diego, especially if you are a student at SDSU! I'm contemplating suing right now given how crooked staff (management) are here! They also have a rodent problem just so you know!< /review>

< review>
Our Room 2215 was so dirty when we tried to move in. There were broken furniture and it was really messed up. We talked with the office and they promised us to get it cleaned very quickly. Four hours later nothing was happened just excuses like we have 300 rooms. Shouldn’t the rooms prepared when the big move in day is? We also tried to get in touch with the manager but they told us she would be busy actually and has no time for complaints. The staff were totally unprofessional and didn’t care about it. On the other hand they advertise a luxury living but everything is dirty, broken and used. It is absolutely not recommendable until yet. We will do another update soon to get a balanced Rezension.< /review>

Blvd 63 will take money out of your deposit to essentially refresh the apartment for the next tenants and make you pay for it.

Regardless of how well cleaned the apartment before moving out - and even if you are leaving it in the same condition as you entered- they will charge you hundreds of dollars for "professional" cleaning, carpet cleaning and painting.

In every other rental agreement, unless there is significant intentional damage, these things are considered to be under normal wear and tear. Landlords usually invest in refreshing the place for the next tenants as part of their business. Blvd 63 instead just makes you pay for it because they think they can go unchallenged.

Not only do they charge you hundreds of dollars they do not even provide you with any photo evidence as to what has been fixed or what damage has been caused which needed remedying.

Instead they simply send your deposit statement back with half of it removed without any explanation or evidence.

If you want to stay in a massively overrated place where management will charge you hundreds or thousands of dollars unnecessarily for their own gain then go for it.

Otherwise avoid like the plague.<//Review><user_id>115117106901961069181< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Terrible contract terms. There's a special place in hell for whoever invented the term "shared lease agreement." You WILL NOT get out of your lease unless you find a replacement resident, which is nearly impossible. Nobody wants to pay Blvd's premium prices. On top of that, you will need signatures from all your roommates AND guarantors, JUST to approve the new guy/girl. Not to mention the $300 replacement fee.

You will be at the mercy of everyone else when it comes to paying rent and switching out. IF SOMEONE STOPS PAYING RENT, EVERYONE IS PENALIZED UNLESS THEY PICK UP THE SLACK. IF YOUR ROOMMATE DOESN'T LIKE YOUR PICK FOR A REPLACEMENT, YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

Fell in love with this place from the first time my roommates and I came here for a tour. There was no doubt that we would call this place home for the next couple of years. BLVD63 is huge and has all amenities that you could possibly think of: two pools, well-equipped gym, tanning beds, pool tables, study rooms, tv room and more. Besides that, there is always something going on: pool parties, free food, entertaining organized by management/workers. Most people who live here go to state, so you constantly see your classmates around and it is easy to make friends with everybody. Overall, great experience living here so far!< /Review>

I’ve lived here for almost two years now and I’m going to be sad to leave BLVD next year for my study abroad. This is an amazing apartment to live in. Imagine all the social aspects of living in a dorm but none of the gross communal restrooms and lack of privacy. Mostly everyone here is sophomores/juniors/seniors at SDSU, so it’s really easy to socialize and make new friends, especially with all the events that they throw for their residents! The staff is very informational and organized. When I had trouble with anything, Gabby would always be there to explain everything and get it all squared away, which is something I can’t be grateful enough for because I never had to go searching for someone to fix something for me.
The best part about living here is the amount of amenities that we have access to and how huuuuge the rooms are. The apartment comes with the standard furniture, but there’s still plenty of room to personalize and make it our own. The bathrooms have two sinks (if you have a double) and the beds are full sized. It’s a huge upgrade from the dorms, and it costs less too. There’s also a big gym, two pools, and a clubhouse with a lot of individual study rooms if you ever want to have study groups. I really liked the study rooms because the wall is a giant white board that you can do homework problems on.
My one tip after living here for such a long time is that if you have a service request, either call the office or go down and put it in. It’s a lot faster that way than if you submit it online, because they print it right away at the desk and it’ll get into the maintenance workers’ hands faster that way. Other than that, you’re going to have a great time living here!< /Text>

Living at BLVD63 was such a good experience. There was always something to do and it was pretty chill.The vibes went perfectly with the "San Diego state of mind" and I was always excited to show it off to my friend's that visited. The pool and hot tub were my favorite amenities because the resort style made me feel like I was living the luxe life. It wasn't even an option in deciding where I was going to live after my freshman year, as soon as I stepped foot onto the property, I knew this was the place for me.< /review>

Although the commodities and living spaces are nice, the price for living here is extremely high with unnecessary costs for things like monthly events that only a limited number of people attend and does not benefit everyone. Especially those with highly busy days. Parking is unreasonable and you can get towed for changing cars while yours is getting fixed. The reasoning behind getting towed is apparently so that the parking permit is not shared, but even so it is still only one car that gets stored.< /Text>

I really like living here so far. I wish that the community room, tanning, and main office opened before 10am though! But I love the free coffee, 24 hour gym, and the workout classes available!</text>

< review>
Though the apartments are somewhat luxurious the 90% college tenants defiantly lessen the value and quality of the property and your stay by trashing the place, setting alarms off once a week, and constant ding dong ditching. Also the surrounding community is pretty bad.</review>

DO NOT SIGN A LEASE WITH A STRANGER!!  If your roommate does not pay the rent, BLVD63 will send debt collectors after EVERYONE on the lease.  My roommate didn't pay her rent for her last 2 months, and now the rest of us have over $2000 debt on our credit report.  She ran home to Canada after sticking us with the rent.  Don't sign a lease with strangers, especially from other countries!!!!   You've been warned.  It's despicable that BLVD63 encourages foreign students and then forces everyone to co-sign the lease.<//Review>

the worst dorm I've been at, regarding management and noise. the walls are made of paper, security does nothing, way too expensive. the nice campus and surroundings are not nearly worth the nights you will spend frustrated and wide awake in bed until (easily) 3am. do yourself a favour and go somewhere else.</text>

The apartment is nice, but the refrigerator is terrible, it might as well be a air conditioner it doesn't keep food cold. And the quality of the electrical work is also sub par. When I adjust my over head fan speed my speakers all make a clicking noise, and one time my tv flashed white.< /review>

There is a  girl who works in the resident services with glasses who is really quite RUDE , she doesn't smile and is NOT friendly at all. Your really shouldn't have an employee working with your paying residents or be a representation of the BLVD community who can't communicate appropriately or be polite and friendly like the rest of the staff. Her rude demeanor definetly sticks out like a sore thumb.</text>

Good luck trying to get your questions answered by the staff, they're pretty much useless. The only saving grace to the place is the maintenance staff are very friendly and punctual about service requests you have. Wifi is unreliable, the furniture feels cheap and the pool/hot tub closes at 10 pm.</review>

<text>Do yourself a favor and DO NOT LIVE HERE. Where to begin... 1. Most of all most of the staff is extremely rude and unhelpful. 2. The apartment complex is brand new, but has been constructed very cheaply so everything breaks easily. 3. The security is a joke. They walk around and pretend they are keeping this place safe,  but really are not. When you want to contact them they don't even answer. 4. The parking garage is a joke. You pay a monthly fee to park there and your car is not even secure. Cars get damaged and broken into because the doors don't even work. Not to mention my car was TOWED unfairly. All BLVD 63 cares about is the ridiculous amount of money they get from their residents. If I could move I would, but I'm stuck in their expensive 12-month lease. I wish I could give them no stars.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1527111235704, 'text': "Melisa, thank you for your feedback.

<pictures>None< /pictures><text>Yeah it's new and seems nice as a visitor BUT:
- Be prepared to be woken up in the middle of the night once a week by the eardrum-bursting fire alarm that lasts 30 minutes or longer. Cannot emphasize enough how unnecessarily loud they are. Your ears will feel as if they are bleeding.
- Live on the top floor or enjoy drunk idiots jumping around above you
- No one uses the trash chutes and throws their bags on the floor of the trash room
- Drunk idiots screaming at the top of their lungs in the middle of the night 3+ nights a week
- Stay away from the units surrounding the pools. There's a high concentration of groups of insecure douchebags who love to be as loud as possible to let everyone know they're having a grand old time giving themselves cancer by drinking copious amounts of cheap piss beer and smoking their d1ck flavored bluntzZ
- Drunk idiots throwing glass bottles into the pool every week
- Majority of residents are spoiled brats or foreign
- Don't live here unless you're one of the above species
- Takes hours after delivery to get your packages
- Go overspend your money elsewhere with at least a decent location</text>< Name>

A fantastic community, great for student living. It has wonderful amenities including washer dryer in unit (no need for quarters), cable TV (with HBO), shuttles to campus, helpful staff, pools, games, and activities for all.< /text>

<Text>Just beware, this place is the typical San Diego college rental that tries to take care of the unsuspecting tenant and keep their deposits!

VERY rude and non responsive to tenants requests.  Sent emails for 5 days leading up to Move-out only to be ignored about the procedure and specifics about parking passes and security deposit return.  I am a guarantor of my daughters apartment and I would of liked this info before she had to leave.  Talked to them today, ONE day after move-out and they said there were "too busy" to get to anyone's questions.    I go after landlords for failure to abide to the rental law on specific events such as move out and to be ignored shows you how unprofessional they are and ignorant of the laws.

So, Christian today informed me that everyone's carpet gets cleaned and charged against the security deposit as "they have to have it sanitized for the next renter".  WRONG.   They do have it have it clean and ready for the next tenant, but IT IS NOT deductible from the security deposit if it;s normal wear and tear.  Once I called her out on her statement, she put me on hold for over 8 minutes only to go and talk to her manager.  Then I got transferred to the Manager who told me that they were "too busy" to itemize and take photos of everyone's unit that just moved out to prove the damage and that she has over 250 units to manage!  Oh well, that $2800 rent x 250 so they should have plenty of money to pay the proper staff to do their job.</Text><user>109857001594758435718<//user><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< time>

This is by far the Coolest place to live around SDSU!

The twos pools and the hot tub, the gym, the shuttles and all the amenities make it really comfortable.</review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>WORST place I could've possibly chosen to live. It certainly seems nice at a glance but what you don't see is that the appliances and plumbing are the cheapest, worst quality there is. Everything is always clogging and the dishwasher doesn't even work.

Get ready to be woken up at least once a a week by a fire alarm that go on for half an hour. Get ready to hear Fetty Wop blasting till the wee hours in the morning during finals. Get ready to walk into the hallways greeted by dog poop and vomit.

The pool areas are nice but are closed half the time because some idiot threw a bottle off their balcony and when they are open, they're over run by El Cajon's finest lowlives. You can't even call security because the phone number doesn't work.

Lastly, good luck getting your security deposit back because they do this thing where two weeks before move out they send a notice saying ALL your roommates need to sign IN-PERSON, but of course it's summer and most people are gonna vacationing. They also lost $600 of designer sunglasses I ordered from amazon.

<review>The apartments are themselves are actually prett nice, many amenities and very central location.  All in all not bad, however the  parking situation is an absolute joke.  Either pay an exorbitant amount for a parking permit (which cost more than a parking permit at SDSU) try to find parking around the complex (many spots which have been marked white with meter maids patrolling constantly) or park in the surrounding neighborhood where pissed off residents slash your tires for parking in front of their houses (I see on average about half a dozen tires slashed and cars keyed a week and have literally seen hundreds of tires slashed in the last year)  All while the parking structure sits half empty. If you're going to pay a "luxury price" parking should absolutely be included.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The best possible accommodation you live in and the price is all inclusive even Wi-Fi and the main furniture are attitudes and electricity, very clean Staff are wonderful and young people help you with anything and have festive occasions every month I think if I sat in Sandigo 4 years what I think I change until حتى but you have to search for Apartment before and booked from their page on Facebook and announce the search for friends if Tibi live with people only drawback is difficult to find an apartment with Romitat.
Note: Housing is not recommended for families because it is 99% ؜ young men and women and university students, but they are respected because the housing Mb any one is estimated to pay Mghlh (expensive for some)
Its advantages
- Bus Uodic and return to the University of SDSU
- Privacy and safety of housing
- Gas station, restaurants, pharmacy, bank and all the services you need very close to you.

افضل سكن ممكن تسكن فيه والسعر شامل كل شيء حتى الواي فاي والاثاث الرئيسي عادا المواقف والكهرباء ، نظيف جداً موظفيه رائعين وشباب يساعدونك بأي شيء ويوجد لديهم مناسبات احتفاليه كل شهر اعتقد لو بجلس في سانديغو ٤ سنين ما افكر اغيره حتى  👍🏼 لكن يجب عليك البحث عن الشقه قبل وحجزها من صفحتهم في الفيسبوك وتعلن فيها بالبحث عن اصدقاء اذا تبي تسكن مع ناس عيبه الوحيد صعب تجد شقه مع روميتات.
ملاحظة : السكن لا يوصى للعوائل لانه ٩٩٪؜ شباب وبنات  وطلاب جامعة لكنهم محترمين لان السكن مب اي احد يقدر يدفع مبغله ( غالي بالنسبه للبعض )
مميزاته
- باص يوديك ويرجعك للجامعه SDSU
- خصوصيه وامان فالسكن
- محطة وقود ومطاعم و صيدليه وبنك و جميع الخدمات التي تحتاجها قريبه جداً منك.</Review>< username>

<user>110956776127992967534< /user><review>(Translated by Google) I give 4 stars because I loved living down, the setting is super nice, a quarter of an hour walk or shuttle SDSU and the value for money compared to other residences is really worth it. There are many international students and the place makes it possible to make lots of meetings. The maintenance service is great and fast.
HOWEVER the big downside is the administrative service, if you arrive outside office hours, no one will be there to welcome you and give you the keys and you may end up on the street for the night. They will not give you any information, it's up to you to pick them up. Level payment of rent and deposit I think he should be ashamed. You have to pay to pay your rent and despite an impeccable apartment they will take you a nice sum on your deposit which will not be returned by transfer but thanks to a check sent to your home. To recover it do not be impatient and do not be afraid to contact them several times if you want to review the color ...
Mine is "weirdly" not arrived, result we must pay to have a follow-up to be sure that it is sent. Not to mention the cost of international calls that I had to make ...
To summarize, I recommend this residence which is for me the best but administrative side I think they are thieves and there is much progress to be made.

Je donne 4 étoiles parce que j’ai adoré vivre la bas, le cadre est super sympa, à un quart d’heure à pied ou en navette de SDSU et le rapport qualité prix par rapport à d’autres résidences vaut vraiment le coup. Il y a beaucoup d’étudiants internationaux et le lieux permet de faire pleins de rencontres. Le service de maintenance est super et rapide.
CEPENDANT le gros bémol est le service administratif, si vous arrivez en dehors des heures d’offices, personne ne sera là pour vous accueillir et vous donner les clés et vous risquez de vous retrouver à la rue pour la nuit. Ils ne vous donnerons aucune information, à vous d’aller les chercher. Niveau paiement du loyer et de la caution je trouve qu’il devraient avoir honte. Vous devez payer pour payer votre loyer et malgré un appartement impeccable ils vous prendront un jolie somme sur votre caution qui ne vous sera pas rendue par virement mais grâce à un chèque envoyé à votre domicile. Pour la récupérer ne soyez pas impatient et n’ayez pas peur de les contacter plusieurs fois si vous voulez en revoir la couleur ...
La mienne n’est “bizarrement” pas arrivée, résultat nous devons payer pour avoir un suivi afin d’être sûr qu’elle est envoyée. Sans compter le coût des appels à l’international que j’ai du effectuer...
Pour résumer, je recommande cette résidence qui est pour moi la meilleure mais coté administratif je trouve que ce sont des voleurs et qu’il y a de gros progrès à faire.</review><rating>4< /rating><name>Margaux Prigent<//name><date>1531266735519</date>< gmap_id>

So wrong!  The prices were fantastic, and the selection of products was so unexpected- I was expecting it to be like the little dollar stores back home, but this store had so much to offer.  Besides a pretty good selection of food there was a gardening section, toys, pet products, kitchen supplies, home decor, basic hardware, auto supplies, clothes- we were in there for quite a while!  When we were done filling our cart, we got in line and the wait was minimal.  Our cashier was friendly and helpful- maybe we went at a low traffic time of day (Friday, dinner time-ish) but we were delighted to find this place in such a small town!</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOywmwhp-Ft1XIbiAdoV5HQPrazKVQVcgJZnyO9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

Too small...little town but least expensive place to shop. Build a bigger store....please

Update 2021..this store has stepped up its game. Very organized and regularly stocked. It still gets hit hard when sales start...goes from stocked to wiped out....yep still needs to be bigger...<//Review>

Most employees are kind & willing to help** But the store is Crowded with merchandise that has yet to be stalked onto the shelves... While customers are unable to find what they came in for..(on a regular basis) as well as not enough registers open, in response to this there is (more often than not) a extremely long line that takes anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes to make it to check out. *Obviously under staffed*< /review>

Usually out of stock on most items in their freezers and fridges. Follow the check in with a mask and take it off once you're in rule while you're herded into a stall of anti-maskers to check out with one cashier. Otherwise, nice that Portola actually has a store with realistic prices. Shout out to them for actually having food during the COVID lockdown< /text>

Over priced and understocked....too many expired items on the shelf because they only hire the bare minimum. Even on their busiest of days you will be lucky if two registers are open but, most of the time don't bother buying ice cream.<//text>

The cold ones go for 2 bucks. If ur gonna charge 2 bucks for a coke at least sell one in glass container but naw 2 dollar for a plastic coke in a store called dollar general.

I dread going... Store is dirty. Shelves are never stocked. Boxes filled with supplies are left in the isle unattended. Long lines and long waits to check out. Usually one checker. Employees smoke out front and don't wash their hands after clocked in. The employees are nice and helpful. Management needs to get the store in order.</Review>

This is like the Walmart of Portola. It has a little bit of everything. Service is not great, but okay. Lines are not great, but okay. They have security alarms that makes noise on the laudry detergent and razors, but I was able to grab both without having to wait around for someone. This place is not too bad!<//Review>

No protocol for employees....short time experienced help.....needs more registers open when customers are lining up 6 to 10 people deep and no other help is to be found or seen.... I don't blame the employees for what they have been taught....I blame the company that taught them...end of " RANT"</Review>

There are good workers in these stores. One in Portola and one in Quincy. Plumas County, California. They just need more workers at both. They lose workers constantly. And 2 people working a shift? Kudos to you. The locals who shop in them need to show better behavior as well. There are items stuffed or left where they don't belong!  Then they complain about poor and slow service. Stop being the problem! I know its a tax write off situation for the company, but the workers who are trying ,need you to be more considerate. Be a stand-up American and behave like the persons there are part of your family.<//review>

< Review>
The prices are incorrect on so many items in the store that it causes many problems for the cashiers as well as the customers. There is a very bad problem with this. Also, most of the time many shelves are empty and there are big full rolling shelves all over the store that block the stocked items. These shelves are very heavy and hard to move. This store is a huge mess. Keeping employees is another obvious issue. You people need to get this heck of a mess fixed. I'm getting to where I think it would be worth the ride to Reno to shop in an organized business. Your customers AND your employees are frustrated!!</Review>

<Review>i have been in Portoilett for too long already. as far as i can say Ill be as honest as I can. The DG. store is the number 1 place for buying nonfresh food items in Portoilet. but on my list of ten this DG gets a rank of 5. that rank is only due to the locale.in town the DG gets a best place for canned and frozen foods and other items for stash. there is everything fromhair brushes to canned food .< /Review>< rate>

The employees are very nice ,social and humorous.  As far as helpful ,not very, they don't know what's on sale or where things are or if certain items will be restocked,  the isles are a mess and you can't find what your looking for,,stocking carts are blocking isles and the clothing isle "Enter at own Risk" THEY NEED HELP!!!< /text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>The Dollar General in Portola, CA. is  under staffed with an over worked skeleton crew. The store is cluttered with random items and shelves are rarely stocked with in-demand items and when someone finally does get things from the storage area many items are expired ( like bugs in the cereal) from sitting in storage instead of the isles. When the announcement of a DG coming to Portola was heard we were very happy and relieved because the other stores in this town are so expensive. It would be highly advantageous for a much larger DG with produce and a meat section in Portola to be added. It would make plenty of revenue and jobs are needed.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Text>I have been treated poorly by most of the employees here but today by far tops the list! Brenda was my checker and she was absolutely rude! The store is disorganized, dirty and the employees(with the exception of 2) are imbecils who should not be working with the public. I spend A LOT of money there  but not anymore with the quality of customer service I have experienced. Such a shame. Our small town needs good businesses. Dollar general just lost mine.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Great Prices, Lots of stuff in lots of places. "Some" helpful staff. But...if you're in a hurry go to Leonards. Still the best thing to happen in Portola in a while.<//Text>< Pictures>

Cheap prices but that is about it. The store is almost always a mess. The service is slow. And most of the time the employees seem under trained over worked and sumtimes unprofessional. Go somewhere else if you can</text>

I was at the store 5 minutes ago, spent 10 minutes shopping, spent 30 minutes in line, they closed the line I was standing in with 12 people still waiting and then left everyone to try to merge with the only other register left open. Absolutely ridiculous!</Review>

This Dollar General saved my life when I forgot my makeup bag at home and I came to Portola for a wedding!!! They had enough applicator sponges, brushes, and other makeup products to supply me for my cousin's special day.</Text>

The short woman, cashier is passive aggressive. I always get a laugh out of her. Asked if the tostitos were mix and match. She handed me the advertisement pages and said look for yourself.<//text>

Large array of merchandise, friendly clerks, reasonable pricing, and they're open late compared to other stores where they close at 9 to 10 PM so that's a plus.<//review>

First time here for me.  Was staying in town and wanted something to drink.  It isn't the fanciest place for sure, but their prices are reasonable and they have a pretty good selection.  Oddly, they also sell a number of other things making it a bit of a mini-mart.  The guy behind the counter was very friendly and helpful.  I was quite happy with my purchase.</review>

Very crowded with stuff inside, but not the right stuff! Ha! Very limited in diet soda and the cashier didn't know what Rootbeer is. 🙃<//Review>

The young man who was the cashier/server tonight has some of the best customer service I've had in years. Very polite, welcoming, he helped us order, checked on us several times, and just well mannered!! It was a breathe if fresh air to be treated like that.

The food was absolutely amazing and it looked like a 5 star restaurant (my picture didn't do it justice). Taste was fresh and flavorful. They cook your meal to order so its not just sitting around. Big portions too!

The interior is beautiful! Veryyyyy clean and modern looking. Their kitchen is also very clean which is also awesome. Overall amazing place!<//Review>

I always enjoy some good Mediterranean food, and PETRA did not disappoint. I ordered the beef kabob lunch special $10.99, and I got a nice spread of food. I was warned it was going to be 15-20 minutes, and so was everyone else who ordered. Its not because they were super busy, it's because they start cooking when you order. Thats fresh. Calling and placing your order ahead might be the way you wanna go if you don't want to wait. The meat was tender and delicious. Nice clean tables and over good spot. Even the bathroom was nice. As the T800 said, "I'll be back"<//Review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>My wife and I decided to stop here for lunch as we passed by. I had the chicken lunch special and my wife had the vegetarian plate. The food was excellent and we eat Mediterranean regularly. The owners were super nice, they informed us it was their third day opened. My wife's vegetarian plate came out quite a bit later than my plate which was slightly inconvenient but we just attributed that to them just getting started so we brushed it off. Plus the owners were really sweet and brought is a couple of pieces of baklava for the wait. All in all a great experience and we will be back!<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMi1PsdxeovH-9fuv36bzTQsGdxe8Pos1lfG2vU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzkcpGmcUf8sL0d-4WnLukqjUpbw6Lc29v1MMj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x809467f5368550ed:0x4ce38ef049a89860<//GmapID></record>

Just come here. You'll enjoy it.< /text></record>

The food here at Petra is amazing. I got the chicken kabob plate and was not disappointed. The chicken was well seasoned, hot and juicy. The salad was fresh and the hummus was very good. The restaurant is clean and has a modern look. The staff here is very friendly. Overall, the quality and flavor of the food as well as the excellent customer service has made my experience at Petra's very pleasant. I will definitely be coming back.<//Review>

Wow everything here reminded me of food I had in Greece. The tabouleh was perfect and full of fresh parsley, tomato and Onion, and the baba ghanoush was smooth and creamy. I had the three kabob dinner and would get that again in a heartbeat! While the place is small, it's also incredibly clean and nice inside. This is a 'must try'! Ps it was reminiscent of Sam's up in Davis near the UC Davis campus, which remains one of my favorites in the Mediterranean arena. However, on food quality I'd have to say Petra just nudged Sam's from my top slot.<//Review>

This is the best Mediterranean food in town!!! Hands down! I had a great experience dinning in for lunch, very clean environment with friendly staff and great customer service. Brought back memories for me, I enjoyed the bed kabob plate, my favorite! So much food I had to box up the rest for later< /Review>

I called ahead of time with plenty of time and still order wasn’t ready. On my lunch. Can’t afford to wait another 30 minutes. This place can do better. They had a lot of plates backed up not getting orders right. Getting sent back. Good food but terrible management</review>

Sad to say we didn't eat here since no one came to get our order.  We went down the street kenjis and had a plate of food less then 5min.</review>< Pics>

<Review>The food here is incredible, the quality of ingredients, the Mediterranean flavors, the presentation/garnish, everything was cooked to perfection. The restaurant is spotless and beautiful with their Marble floors and tabletops, I honestly cant wait to back and try everything. Highly reccomend the Mix plate, especially if its your first time trying Mediterranean cuisine. Also the staff/owners were very kind and considerate, they made us feel very welcome and we had a great experience.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I've personally never been to a Mediterranean by choice and I'm happy I've picked this place for my first time. I met the owner at where I work and he kindly invited me for a free meal at his restaurant. Thanks again Sammy you're the man. P.s try the lamb you won't be disappointed.</review>

This is my third time coming to Petra’s Mediterranean Grill , I’ve ordered the chicken kabob plate twice and the chicken bowl once. So tasty, the best Mediterranean place in Fresno. Super clean in the inside and they give you great customer service.</Text>

<review>My husband and I live around the corner from this place and have been staring at the "Coming Soon" sign for a while now, patiently waiting for the doors to open.

Well, last night as I was out fetching Panda Express for the kiddos, I noticed that the "Coming Soon" sign had changed to "Now Open."

I shouldn't have stopped.  I should have waited for my husband to get back from working out of town.  I should have resisted the urge to give the place a try.... oh, but I'm glad I didn't.

Let's talk basics...

The digs:  So, yes. This little restaurant is located in a strip mall next to a shoe store.  Don't hold that against them.  Once you walk inside, you will see that the place is bright and clean and the epitome of minimalistic class.  No gawdy decor, no loud music; just clean, bright and simple.

The peeps:  Upon entering, I was greeted by a friendly young gentleman who answered all of my questions about the menu items, made a suggestion (spicy chicken plate), and then seated me in a booth.  As I waited for the food to be prepared, the same gentleman brought me a delicious piece of petra cake that I enjoyed while I waited.  A young woman who was tidying up after a previous customer also greeted me kindly.  Overall, at this point, the people were the best part of the place so far.... that was, of course, until I tasted the food.

The grub:  They get it.  I mean, they really get it. It was a perfect marriage of subtle spice and inviting seasonings.  The chicken was tender, but not mushy. The salad, the hummus, the garlic sauce and pita bread... all good.  And the rice!  Yum.  As I mentioned previously, my whole mission before my visit to Petra was to pick up Panda for my children, so I had to take my food to go.  Let's just put it this way, all three of my children no longer had any interest in their chain-created mock-chinese food; They wanted mine instead.  Even my 13 year old son, who swears he's the next Gordon Ramsey, gave it a rave review.

In conclusion, this place is definitely worthy of a 5 star rating.  I can't wait to try all the different plates and dishes.   We definitely needed a good Mediterranean restaurant around here, and Petra delivers the goods.

Go check them out. You will not be disappointed.  😀<//review><Rate>5</Rate>< gmapID>

Excellent mediterranean food with quality ingredients and good prices.  The chicken shawarma plate with pilaf, salad, humus and pita was perfect.  The garlic yogurt sauce, salad dressing and pilaf were all impressive.  I'm going to try the falafel or spicy chicken next time.  The brand new building and white interior give Petra a nice clean vibe inside.  Check out the stylish booths and bring cash to avoid a small credit card fee.  Thank you Sammy for the excellent service.< /Review>

Who wouldn't love to see the end of Route 66??  I know I Love it and have loved it for over 4 decades!!
What other road ANYWHERE in the world will play 'America The Beautiful'? While your pondering that, how many roads do you know extend over 2,400 miles??  How about a road that has been in existence for nearly a Century???  You'll find that all, on Route 66!!  As far as the end of it, well, the only reason it ended, is because there was no more land to continue it.  Do yourself a favor, if you ever find yourself bored, or have nothing better to do, take a ride to The End of Route 66!!  You'll thank me later.  Route 66 is truly 'The Stuff of Legend!'< /Text>

Famous route 66. Right on ocean ave is the entrance to the peer. Many parking garages in the area for 2$ after the first hour or park on the peer for $15 flat. Enjoy the arcades and mini amusement parks, street performers and souvenir shops. Great spot to see sunset.</review>

<text>(Translated by Google) Route 66 never really ends here, but definitely this place is quite magical to be at least once and enjoy all those little shops and views.

Realmente aquí nunca termino la ruta 66, pero definitivamente este lugar es bastante mágico para estar al menos una vez y disfrutar de todos esos pequeños comercios y vistas.</text>< pics>

<text>(Translated by Google) The Santa Monica pier is a tourist attraction. The shops and restaurants are somewhat expensive but it is logical within the brand in which it is located. Still worth a walk and make a couple of photos. Attractions like the roller coaster and the Ferris wheel cost $ 10 each. We rode the roller coaster and they gave us two laps. It's short but it's worth going up just for fun. If you want the photo, the price rises to $ 14.

(Original)
El muelle de Santa Mónica es toda una atracción turística. Las tiendas y restaurantes son algo elevados de precio pero es lógico dentro del marcó en el que se encuentra. Aún así merece la pena dar una vuelta y hacer un par de fotos. Las atracciones como la montaña rusa y la noria cuestan 10 dólares cada una. Nosotras montamos en la montaña rusa y nos dieron dos vueltas. Es cortita pero merece la pena subir solo por la diversión. Ya si quieres la foto el precio se eleva a 14 $.< /text>< date>

This is really a good site! I'm not a dump type of gal but I assisted my husband bring cut up tree limbs to the dump's green area on Sunday!! It was quiet and pretty clean for a dump. Everyone wore masks and the staff were really helpful. They are a open 7 days a week. On Sundays the dump closes at 3pm.</Text>

<review>Just an FYI, don’t wait inline for 1-2hr on the free 3rd Friday of every month for the free dump. Just pay the $10 to drop it off M-F large or small amount is $10. I didn’t know and waited over an hour to dump 3 tires and some other small stuff on the free Saturday. But overall he employees were helpful, but just crazy long line for my first time here.</review>< Pics>

<review>The lines are always long at this place. The price is competitive with any other refuse site. I'd rather go to San Timoteo landfill. Even though it's a bit further I'd rather drive than wait in line.< /review>< pictures>

<Text>People out front are surely rude they make you jump around from window to window and it’s obviously too noisy to be hearing what’s going on also the line today was 2 1/2 hours long and when we got to the front of the ladies that were working out front we’re all on their personal phones and showing each other their nails while they should of been taking care of customers.< /Text>< pictures>

Never thought the trash company should be in charge of recycling in the first place.  You can see a lot stuff needlessly thrown away that easily could have been recycled.instead its tossed into a gigantic hole in the planet we call home. Today i witness practically a whole dumpster mostly full cardboard get dumped with the trash. People are stubborn.  I see the recycling system in riverside still needs a lot of improvement.< /text>

My parents had a flat tire in the property, they do not speak English well, so the employee basically called a guy check, left,  and left my parents under the hot sun to fix the tire themselves, and then ignored them.He was also very rude. They are in their 60s and feel dizzy. After I called the manager, he sent a guy to assist changing spare tire, but still not willing to be responsible for the tire beside give an extra free dump. I was wondering what if its not the tire but they step on the nails. that is very dangerous, could cause life threatening disease. Strongly not recommend to go if you do not want to be treated rudely and spend extra money to pay a new tire and go to hospital for sunstroke or even tetanus<//Text>

Good place to take my green waste from yard clippings and tree trimmings, the place is basically as is...

You get there they way the vehicle and trailer if applicable, leave a deposit. You dump the waste. You get weighed again because that's where the money is at. Per ton. Then all done< /text>

Just finished up visiting. Dad is a HUGE John Force fan, hes visiting from NY and 1 of the places he wanted to go while out visiting was John Forces museum. As someone else mentioned, museum is $5 bucks but they give u $5 off when u spend $30. Good deal IMHO especially since in the store everything is reasonably priced. That being said the 3 people we dealt with at Racestation today 8/25 in the afternoon were AMAZING. Beyond friendly and courteous. With the amount of Force racing memorabilia in the museum it was worth the $5. Its awe inspiring to see so many of the trophies he won there. But the people here were amazing, knowledgeable and courteous and they put on a good face for the Force organization. It is well worth a stop to view, weather you are a huge fan like my dad is or a casual fan like myself.<//review>

This place is to cool for school. Came across this place via Trip Advisor. Best 5 bucks I've spent in years. Full of race and Force family history. Staff was very friendly.  A must see if you're in the area.< /review>

Super cool to finally get here. Got to go out in the shop and check out a lot of Johns old funny car bodies. Place is packed with memorabilia. Would have been fun if John showed up....</text>

I had a GREAT time at John Force Racing in Yorba Linda, CA. The young guy at the gift shop was terrific and very helpful. The museum area is more than worth the $5.00 admission, (which they give back to you should you buy something in the gift shop). I highly recommend stopping by and seeing the Force shop in Yorba Linda...you will not be disappointed!< /Text>

<review>A must do for all petrolheads! My girlfriend and I dropped by yesterday while on our Westcoast roadtrip from NZ to check out the museum, The Staff were AMAZING! They were really friendly and open, showing us around the facility and answering our questions. Then we were lucky enough to have John come down for a chat and  photo!!! Highlight of our trip so far! I've been that excited since I only realised tonight I left without actually buying anything, whoops! Thanks again to John and the team!!!!< /review>< UserId.>

Came to grab an order to go through a tiny window and was rejected from a service because  my mask was “see through”. Seriously!? Have you read the latest order that says you don’t have to wear masks anymore outside??!! And I was actually outside, it’s not even an establishment but a booth where you stand on the street and take your smoothie from a counter, still outside. And I was shopping entire mall without any problems.
This is ridiculous and doesn’t comply with any “health” concept or even logic. Also no normal explanation or apologies or offering of a better mask. Super rude and illogical.</Text>

Stumbled upon Protini Bar while walking around, decided to stop by and rice it a try and i must say that it was the best smoothie outside of the ones I make at home. With all natural ingredients with a broad range of choices.

They also allow to create your own, they simply call it "Creative",

All natural, organic and non GMO's<//Text>

<text>We ordered 2 drinks the other day. The same thing, except one added one extra ingredient, chia seeds, shouldn’t change the flavor too much. It took 40 mins to get them, and when we did they tasted drastically different. The original was fine, the second was inedible and smelled really funny.

Decided to try again now and it still has a taking over 25 mins for our orders andThere’s no one waiting. I can see the workers on their phone though. Giving 3 stars as an average

5 stars for the first drink
1 Star for the second
2 stars for the long wait<//text></record></dataset><record>

They use rotten bananas and cover them up in syrup and granola or some seeds. When I asked them why would they keep those rotten bananas. The guy said “we use them in our special menu” because a rotten banana has more nutrients than a fresh one.
I had to go back and asked them to replace banana.

I know the difference between a banana with black spots and banana that’s is rotten.
Check your cameras.
I noticed your staff used a rotten banana, but I wasn’t sure and I reached home tasted it and went back to get it replaced. If you really worried about your customers, just ask your staff to serve fresh fruits.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

What you might have gotten was an extra ripe banana. A yellow banana may look good to go, but it does not achieve its maximum potential until it has some brown spots on it. The brown spots indicate that the sugar content has risen in the ripening process. A lot of times we keep the extra ripened banana for some of our customers who specifically ask for them .

<Review>Very good Acai  bowl.
Great service;very friendly
Great Pom o berry smoothie
My son loved the peanut dream in the healthy kids menu. He said it was really delicious and I recommend it to everyone including your friends,family and kids!
You can make the acai bowl to your liking,( by this I mean that you can add different fruits and toppings), and it leaves such a sweet taste in your mouth!!!
Pure perfection!!!< /Review>< pics>

Being allergic to so many foods and being a health freak who loves sweets, this is my go to place. It’s so indulgent you can find a variety of things and everything is fresh and healthy. My fav is the acai bowl and peanut power because it literally tastes like your drinking a ice cream shake but it’s so healthy for you and no guilt after! The staff is awesome and everything I’ve tried thus far is sooo good!! So happy there’s a place like this that you can enjoy and stay healthy at the same time!!< /text>

<text>I ordered a protein shake and waited 10 minutes before finally asking what was going on. The staff were not at all apologetic, brushed it off and said they would make it now. They didn’t offer anything to make up for forgetting my order. In the end I had to ask for a refund. I don’t need to pay $10 for a mediocre drink to have terrible customer service on top.<//text><gmapID>0x80c29c20491b0665:0x7670078b1d3e597c<//gmapID><user>118170255283454250228< /user><Rate>1<//Rate><username>Michael< /username></record></dataset><record>

It's really hard to find outstanding or even good places these days, and when I say good places I mean businesses that are really there for you to serve you, and they care about you, the costumer! From A to Z... It starts with the nice modern appearance this place has, cleanliness, the staff, service, the product of course and the list goes on. This place has it all!! I am SO glad I found this little family operated health juice bar! When you get there, you are greeted by employees that you can tell are happy to be there and having a good day! The complete opposite of going to most franchise juice bars and getting a sub-par service as we all know and familiar with unfortunately. The staff over there is very knowledgeable about their products and the health benefits of each of their items and will explain and answer any questions you may have without rushing you... After placing the order, I had time to just observe everything and boy I was satisfied with what I've been seeing! The place is very sanitary, they all preparing your items with fresh and ripe organic products! They are very professional and trying to really put their heart and soul into their creation for you. My wife and I have tried quite a few items from their menu and we were really blown away by the tastiness and freshness of those delicious healthy products they have for you! Not like any other "Let's make it real quick for ya..." type of smoothies and juices you would get in most other places honestly... We are definitely returning costumers as they get an A+ in my book in every single aspect! I encourage you to go and try them out! You will not be disappointed.<//review>< Pics>

Terrain was difficult due to snow and ice on the Backbone but the weather couldn't have been better for a January hike.. High winds and freezing Temps on the summit but nothing dangerous. Highly recommend bringing microspikes, quality poles, and layers of clothes for warmth</Text>

< Review>
Amazing ridge trail over rough stones with epic views to both sides. East to rough Mojave Desert, Cajun junction and Hesperia city, west to the gorges until the cities of San Bernardino. 😃

I truly recommend the hike from Mount Baldy village to Mt San Antonio summit, Mount Baldy Notch and back down. 👍< /Review>

Martina did my hair great! Usually other places will cut too short but she cut it to my desired length. I also got my hair dyed and i love the color turnout. Thank you Martina!< /Text>

Made an appointment and they are very friendly. Masks are required to wear before, during and after service while inside. They always do a great job here and Seniors get a discount! I will return even though I don't like having to wear a mask. Nice beauticians here and they treat all of their customers with respect.</text>

Before and after my medium skin fade (with gel they provided), the hair cutter was very skilled and polite, definitely getting all my future hair cuts from here.<//Text>

<review>A blessing in disquise.Had a apt w Martina she was fully backed up and over booked. Upsetting she didnt have the courtesy to call and try to reschedual. Whats the point of a apt. Glad I came across Natalia she was able to take me in for a haircut.I went back next day for a loooong hair color process.WOW best choice is Natalia by far very friendly and knows what she is doing. She brought my soul back to life in this pandemic.<//review>< Pics>

You. an walk-in or make appointment. We tried to call and make an appointment and no one answered the phone, so the appointment option did not help us, however we went early and didn't have to wait too long.
The stylist did ok, this is the 3rd time we have gotten a younger stylist that when we try to explain my mother wants her hair short on side and neck they try to shave like a man's haircut and even though we explain ahead of time. So they either are not trained to do the "old lady" cut or they are not listening to their client, either way not the best experience. So I either can go when the lady that does it right is working or find another location.<//text>

This is the only place I will cut or color my hair. Veronica is the best hair stylist. She is the only one I will trust to cut, syle, dye my hair. Been going to her for years she does get busy but she is definitely worth the wait. She knows exactly what she is doing i will never go to anyone else but her. Vero thanks girl!</Text>

It feels like cotton candy. I’m a senior with grey roots was trying to go grey all over so I didn’t have to color my hair anymore. I came out bright orange  & $270.00 less in my pocket.

I had dreads for two years and decided to comb them out and redo them. I needed a major chop due to my hair being uneven. I have really thick natural hair so I decided to get a trim before I get my sisterlocks. Made an appointment and got serviced the same day. Jasmine was my hair stylist and I was skeptical at first with her dealing with me hair. She did an AMAZING JOB. My hair is proportioned all over. I have so much volume and less napping on the ends. If I wasn’t getting locks I would go back for the service. Only $20 for a detailed trim!<//review>

Love Melissa who works here, can't speak for any of the other stylists as I haven't gotten a cut from anyone else. I usually have to go home and fix/change a cut at least a little bit (thin it out or even out sides, etc), even when I go to a pricey place. This was the first cut in my entire life (maybe I just have bad luck) that I haven't had to touch up at all and that I loved immediately. Melissa did a great job and was friendly/talkative, but not over the top chatty. Great experience.< /review>

If I could, I would give you 0 stars. My husband got his hair colored and it is a complete mess. Color is wrong. They did it golden brown & he needed an ash brown. He has color everywhere on his skin!
I had a blow out with shoulder length hair for $30 total bill was $74. No Tip!
Unbelievable I should not have been charged for my husband's hair at all! Run run far away to another salon.<//Review>

I usually get my hair cut by the stylists at the SDSU location on El Cajon Blvd, they know how to cut hair. I was in the area the other day and short on time so I tried the Chula Vista location....big mistake....the CV location is definitely not doing what the El Cajon Blvd spot is doing. A generous two stars for an overall disappointing visit; lack of product selection, a mediocre cut, and close to two hours wasted.....lesson learned...I'll never stray from the stylists at the El Cajon location again.

I'm trying to cancel all 3 services I have with Terminix due ONLY to their inept customer service.  The technicians I've had the pleasure to work with have been fabulous - courteous, professional, responsive and very effective.  They go the extra mile when asked for help. I've been with Terminix for something like 15 years at 2 different addresses in different parts of the US.  If it was just on the strength of the technicians I would recommend Terminix unreservedly with 5 stars.

That's why cancelling my services is so painful, because I know there are hard-working, dedicated professionals who work there.

Unfortunately the customer service or account administration is woeful.  This includes billing and just getting to a person that can help (that is not a technician).  As I write this, I have been on hold for 35 minutes trying to reach someone in the "cancellation department" to cancel my services.

Here follows a more detailed description of the sad state of Terminix's customer support in my case.

For the 1st 2 months of 2021, I got no invoices from Terminix for my termite protection services.  I called Terminix in January to try and understand what was going on, but all the people I spoke to could not understand what was going on either.  Call-backs that were promised never happened.  Finally in March I got 3 months worth of invoices in 1 invoice that simply said I was past due.  No explanation or apology, and I was made to feel responsible for what turned out to be an  invoicing issue at Terminix that affected a lot of customers.

My next invoices in April had a 6% price increase across the board.  No explanation was given and no warning.  I talked to several phone reps about the increase.  They all promised call backs from the "local" office that never materialised.  The last rep I spoke to said that it was an oversight and that the original charge amount was correct and would be reinstated.  Again, he said he was filing this with the local office who would contact me. Nothing happened, and the charges stayed the same.

When I called back, a different rep sent an email to the local branch service manager to ask for follow-up.  (I know this because I saw a copy of her email).  The local branch service manager then sent me an email with the data he had scraped from Zillow about my house and said that since my house was worth so much money that paying Terminix seemed "pretty low for a house of that value".

Caifornia is not known for cheap real estate, so I pointed out to him that the cost to rebuild the house is a fraction of the "value" he had pulled off Zillow.  Most of the value is in the land.

This same person then took a different tack and told me by email that they had to increase rates due to increases in cost.  When I asked why there was no notice and why this increase was not aligned with the contract renewal (as required in my contract), I got radio silence.

After about a week, I called again, and this time was called back by another "local" rep.  I couldn't take the call and it went to voice mail where he left me a call-back number.  I called that number within a few hours and left him a voice mail message inviting him to call me.  Now several days later, there has been no response.

So here I am, very frustrated by the ineffectiveness of my efforts to understand (and help) Terminix's billing and customer service process, and unwilling to be disrespected by their "local" customer service any more.  I will be sending my technician an email saying how sorry I am to be parting company and thank him for everything he has done for me.

I hope if you have made it this far, you have found this review helpful.

PS It took 50 minutes to connect with someone who could help me cancel my contracts.  She was super friendly and very apologetic, and is a great example of what good customer service can be.  Terminix could use more people like her.< /text>

My service technician seemed like he barely knew what he was doing today. He couldn’t wipe down my mud dauber nests either. Also he said he usually never dewebbs the property when it’s obvious there are spiders. This is not the first time I’ve been unhappy with terminix so.... yeah I’ll be switching as soon as the next pest control guy comes by<//Review>

I had a rocky start with scheduling excavating birds and had to call twice to get appointment. First call referred to another branch but did not receive call back. Second time I called with initial confusion that service not provided because bird excavating technician fell off roof, which I immediately noted my dissatisfaction with the technician since I was marketed for this service twice via email flyers; however, he notified supervisor that made it right since only limited on roof work and this job only required ladder work that they are still licensed to perform. Manager came out and surveyed job and within 48 hours work scheduled and performed service. Technician that did the work previously treated for preventative termite control and did a solid job with bird excavating, cleaning and sanitizing.  Although came with a fairly high price tag may be well worth as they will come back anytime over the next year if birds return. This service with bird spikes placed seems to be working well so far; my wife was quite frustrated cleaning poop on the ground right outside our front door every day but has not had to since the service.< /text>

I got a text to confirm an inspection appointment, I confirmed and it was set.  for a time period of 10-12 at 12:30 I called customer support.  They tried to reach the tech and couldn't but left a message they then tried the supervisor.  Customer service said both were left a message to contact me about the schedule.  I asked when I should expect that and Customer service said within 2 hrs.  I never got a call back and here 3 weeks later I get a text wanting to finalize a service call,  really I just asked him to cancel the service.  He said I would have to do that, so I asked for the best phone number to call -- no response.   The lack of follow through is annoying.< /review>

<Text>My mother is elderly and has a large, older home. Our service technician, Charles, is a welcome addition to our home upkeep services. He is extremely detailed, knowledgeable, personable and observant. He is confident in his skill level and deservedly takes pride in making sure we are satisfied with his services before leaving. He remembers the details of former visits and automatically takes care of the problematic areas. His responsiveness and detail to attention brings a confident comfort because we know that we will NOT run into any unwanted guests!</Text></record>

We have had Terminix for at least 20 years. When we had our house tented that many years ago we bought the termite insurance for subterranean and the other kind and have never regretted that decision. Several years after the tenting we had to have the whole beam replaced in our kitchen and the work would have cost us about $10,000.00, had we not had that insurance. The contractors did quality work and the insurance covered every penny of it.<//Review>

Our service technician Gustavo is personable and professional.  He always calls  the day before he comes and when he arrives, he asks if I have any concerns or problems. He treats the perimeter of the house and focuses on any areas I highlighted.I would award Gustavo 5 stars. However, Terminix is pricey so I downgraded Terminix to 4 stars< /Text>

<name>Brandon Jackson<//name><Review>Our technician (Luis Castro) was extremely thorough.He was able to identify what the type of insect was invading our home as well as where the location was where they were entering our home. He explained to me what he was going to do, as well as answered a list of questions that both myself and my wife had for him concerning what to do after he had completed.He also put to rest our worries about our cats (we have 4) returning home later in the day.He also encouraged me (if I needed) to contact him with any further questions or concerns.It is rare to find someone that cares for customers as he does.I will recommend your company, and specifically Luis to anyone that needs or asks about our service.We thank you for eliminating an extremely annoying and stressful infestation in our home. 5 stars all the way.<//Review><UserId.>100978799890969732271<//UserId.>< Pictures>

We have been customers for 30 years. We require monthly maintenance because our property is in a rural canyon area of the east county. Our technician " Daniel" possess all of the qualities required for a field service position. He has the training, experience, and desire to perform his job at a high standard. He also has the personal skills to communicate with his customers. A quality that is so critical for retaining customers in the service industry. Thank you, Daniel.</Review>

The pest services provider did a thorough inspection inside and outside of the house. He listened to my concerns regarding ant control and pesticides they may affect my pets. He took the time to explain to me exactly what he was doing and informed me on exactly what to do to ensure my pets were not affected by the pesticides. When he was done he explained to me how ants colonize and enter homes and showed me what he did and areas outside of the home to fix (move my river rock away from the base of the house). He also told me to call him if I saw any activity after a week so he could return and reassess if needed. But I didn’t have to, I took his suggestions regarding the river rock and cleared out 3 inches from the base of the house and I have t seen an ant since he left. Thank You. This is why I pay for your services. All of your technicians take the time to educate me on their processes and always make themselves available for follow on assistance if needed. That and they arrive ON SCHEDULE!
PS. He also wore little booties when he saw I had new carpet in my house!< /text>

He checks to see if we are experiencing any new problems or need any added areas treated.

technicians were good, but two phone calls I made to a technician to ask a question two months ago have not been answered.

<text>I gave a 10 rating because Enrique Greene does a great job at taking care of my house ant problem. Enrique is friendly and explains what he is putting and why he uses it. He also does a good job of letting me know the day before a scheduled appointment and texts me when he is on the way the day of the appointment. If I am not home he texts me when he is done. Enrique does my monthly pest spray around the house but the other day I had ants inside my house and I called Terminex and the next day Enrique was there to take care of it. No more ant problem.</text>< Pictures>

<Time>1550699222859< /Time><rate>1<//rate><Text>Bate and Switch at its finest! I have been a customer of this company for years. When Antimite become Terminix things went crazy. We have always requested to know when they are coming to make sure our pets are secured. Then for the last year every time they come the bill comes it is more than what we had agreed upon. Back in January, they say they came and treated the home. Yet the day before when the tech called I advised him that would not work and not to come that day. A few days later I receive a bill for $109.00. We were never advised that they were going to more than double the cost of the service that we had with them and we were also paying for a treatment when we had requested them to not come. ON 1/31 I spoke with Victor who is a manager and he stated that he was going to take care of the issues. He would credit our account for $60 $30 at one time and then another $30 a few days later and then what our monthly bill would be back to the amount that we had agreed to pay moving forward. I have the tech home out on 2/7 and I paid the tech right then and there as I have always done. by darn it the bill comes this week showing no credit for my check and show right at $25 more than what we agreed. You try to reach them and it is just a mess. Just hate being advised that someone is going to do something and then they don't and you try to reach them there is no way to do. The CS rep can't give me Victor's number unless he agrees to have me have. This is just crazy.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1550781168896, 'text': 'Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

Having been a Terminix customer for more than a decade, we have always experienced only the best service out there. We have always been pre-informed and reminded about upcoming services and the technicians are always courteous, knowledgeable and punctual. We have 3 service contracts with Terminix. When we had our house tented for termites, the instructions were clear and precise and the support from the Terminix team members beyond professional. The technicians always put on their booties as I call it to prevent dirt being carried into the house if there is something to be executed in the house. The flow of information from the minute one contacts customer service to the point of getting the job done has always been without a glitch.  There is a real live person at the other end of the line to answer your calls and you do not have to wait for an hour to be heard.  We have been offered many other services at similar prices, but with the experience we have had with Terminix over the years, it is impossible to trump their professionalism and impeccable service.  This may sound over the top, but we are truly in awe with this company.  Thank you, Terminix!<//review>

<rate>1<//rate><review>This company is by far the most incompetent and lacking of basic customer service that I have ever encountered. Last year, when I found live termites in our home, we scheduled an appointment for treatment. The technician called to say he was running late and then never showed up or called again. This is after I took half a day off work to accommodate their schedule.
Fast forward to this week, where I found termite activity in the exact same location they treated last year, I again scheduled an appointment that was convenient for the company, took half day off work and AGAIN had a no-show/no-call situation. I am beyond fed up with the lack of basic respect for my time. I will never do business with this company again and recommend you shop around before you decide to do business with them.< /review>< Pics>

It took a little convincing with your call center person to schedule a person to come and help us to resolve a rodent issue in our Garage. Enrique Greene, who came on Friday 20, 2016 was very pleasant to work with, very professional and is a role model for your company. He set up the traps and one little field mice got caught by your trap on Saturday AM. If you can, please assign him as our regular Technician for our quarterly service. Thanks.< /Text>

Usually we are not present to witness the technician and his method of operation but so far satisfied that the ant population is under control. We have however noticed an occasional earwig inside the house. But overall Id say Terminix is doing a decent job. If we are home on an upcoming visit I might have him spray in the garage for Black Widows as I know they are present.<//text>

<review>Scheduled a technician to come out to a condo I manage for an ant problem. After being over two hours late, I called and spoke to the receptionist and was informed they had rescheduled the appointment for the following day without informing me. The woman I spoke with couldn’t really explain how or why this happened, but I kindly agreed to have my tenants there the following day for the new appointment. The next day, again there was a no show from the technician. When we called, they informed us that the appointment was for a much later date. For being such a well-known company, they sure lack quality customer service. I would give zero stars if that was an option.< /review>< pics>

The Terminix service people are always courteous and helpful. They work quickly and thoroughly, and the results are great. We have had no pest problems during their time of servicing our home. I give them full marks for the work they do and the way they serve the customer (our family)!<//review>

Because my tech Enrique is extremely professional and makes me feel like a lifelong valued number one customer. I always have questions for him and he always has answers and goes above and beyond to arrive on time and gives me notice.  if I come across any unknown bugs he can help me identify. I never feel rushed in fact I feel educated when I speak with him. He just makes me feel like support from  is a phone call away. I feel like a valued customer by his demonstrable actins - professionalism, patience, availability, and thoroughness. Thank you< /Review>

<Text>Service man was rude and didn't want to answer my questions.. Had to call them for second service because first one didn't work and paid $2000 for treatment. The call line didn't work and then I kept calling and got " high call volume". Finally, spoke with someone and she hangs up on me. I had an appointment from 9am -11 am. NO SHOW.

UPDATE: apparently Terminix has no idea whats andg on so I have to call the company Truheat they contracted to schedule another appointment. So company within company.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>These guys give us a business card for us to call but they don't even answer the phone. Called them during the days they are open and left messages. The guy who gave us the business card claiming that he's one of the higher up that works in Terminix is named Stacy, whom in which I consider  completely unprofessional when it comes to accepting phone calls or returning a message. So what's the point of giving us a number to call but you don't even answer?<//Text><GmapID>0x80dbffb1a82f2e7f:0x5ce27b07002d12ce< /GmapID>< pics>

My score isn't related to associate/service, but the approach. When I first met with a sales associate and they inspected my home back in 2010 they didn't find any live termites, but said I had termites because they found wood damage and termite droppings even though another company a year prior when I bought the home gave termite clearance report. The past several years during inspections and when I've been doing work to the house I continue to find wood damage, further deterioration, and termite pellets. Now that I have paid double what most companies charge to have my house tented and my annual $250 policy renewal they say that I don't have termites no matter what they see/find and indicate basically I would have to start chopping apart wood to try find live termites. This methodology is not consistent and deceptive. If a house doesn't have termites unless they find live bugs, that should be the litmus test on all inspections including before signing sales contract or buying/selling a home. Now due to all the termite damage most of my decks have progressed with wood rot. So basically I feel that the warranty and protection plan doesn't really do much and is not consistent. This is a systemic company wide issue as this methodology has been projected by every tech except the original tech who sold us on tenting the house and termite protection plan.<//text>

My experience with Terminix has been awful. Avoid this company at all costs. We have been long-term customers; we have paid a yearly premium for services since 1993 when Terminix bought out Country Wide. I have been attempting to communicate with the San Diego office to get my property rented for over a month with no success. I have been lied to regarding the need for fumigation, and finally upon requesting documentation of the inspection learned the truth. Terminix is still refusing to tent the property despite the terms of the contract for complete care of our property against termites. The inspector called for fumigation but the manager insists to do a less costly and less effective treatment instead. All documentation has been provided to the San Diego office. Save yourself the headaches!</text>

Horrible service! They took over for Alterra Pest Control and after 2 services I had to cancel. Totally unprofessional and rude was Chris the technician. They ripped me off and lied to me about being "fully covered" for bee's and then BAM...a call from the guy on the same day as the scheduled service just to let me know it's $300 to remove the bee's. I have had enough and just canceled my service and will never look back...THESE PEOPLE ARE RIPOFF ARTISTS!</text>
