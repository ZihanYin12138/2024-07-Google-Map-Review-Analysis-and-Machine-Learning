<text>Dr. Chang is the best dentist I’ve ever had. He is very knowledgeable and is really great at explaining things. He and his staff are really nice too. My kids love them. It’s the only dentistry that I never worry about going to because I know things will be done right and I’ll come out smiling.</text>< Date>

<text>Dr Chang is the greatest dentist anywhere!!!
I was traumatized as a child by bad dentists and was so afraid to go to  dentist ever again until I met Dr Chang and his staff. Very honest, and gentle and a great sense of humor. The girls in the front and back are excellent and I am no longer afraid to go to the dentist as long as I have him. I highly recommend him. Thank you Dr Chang and staff for making me a believer.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

There is not a more friendly and professional group than Dr. Chang and his staff. I love the staff!  Their amazing.  Dr. Chang came in on his day off last year to work on the pain I had on my tooth. He also gave me his cell number just in case i had any issues.  Dr. Chang has good energy, positivity, and has a good sense of humor. His interactions with his dental assistants are kind and friendlier than most dentists I’ve seen in the past. I’ve been coming here for at least a decade.  I should’ve written this sooner.  Thanks Doc!</text>

<review>I left my previous dentist for 15 years when a co-worker recommended Dr Chang 3 years ago and I could say the comparison is like night and day. All of Dr Chang’s staff works with utmost professionalism and friendliness.

Dr Chang and his team are the BEST. Very Friendly and accommodating staff. I’ve been with them for over 10 years I think. Never a complaint. Team of super competent and genuinely good human beings. Prices have always been fair and the work quality is top of the line. God bless you and the staff, Dr. Chang!< /Review>

I am never leaving this dentist. They have been great with everything in my difficult teeth as well as making sure everything is covered by my insurance. I have had everything from crowns redone to a root canal. Unlike other dentists, I don't feel anything. I tried to move to a dentist closer to home and then had a huge problem with a tooth going bad. In doing this I discovered how dentists vary massively in what they can and will do. I am back and will stay with these doctors. All three of them are wonderful.<//Text>

<text>My family and I have been using Dr. Leon’s  dental clinic for about a year now and we are very happy and satisfied with the services that they provide. We understand that this is Covid time and appointments don’t have to be available all the time but I would assume that during normal circumstances appointments will be available on the weekends that we are able to come and get our teeth cleaned! So far we are very happy with the services that the staff and dentist have provided to us and our kids. Our favorite is Aria Nd Uma our dental hygienist 😊she’s amazing 🤩</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Dr. Chang is God send. I found him by accident, when I had a tooth emergency. My insurance gave me his office information and I made this my permanent dentist. He is very gentle and informative. The office is very clear, everyone is nice and sweet. He has referred me to an orthodontist office for my daughter that I'm very happy with. I would refer this office and Dr.Chang over and over again.<//review>

Dr. Chang is a great dentist! He is thorough with the exams and explains procedures and options. He went out of his way to find a new product to try for my dry mouth problem. I appreciate his kindness and caring.  I moved in the past year and am no longer close to Dr Chang's office but do not want to change dentists</text>

The front lobby staff was really kind and gave me everything I needed to get checked in. The assistant, Rea (spelling?)  who did my xrays and assisted the Dr. was so sweet and really thorough with the preliminary information and xrays. Dr. Chang went the extra mile after my checkup,  by fixing a sharp area on one of my back molars by sanding it down a little. It felt much better! I’m super pleased with my experience and definitely recommend!</Review>< Pictures>

<text>Dr. Chang’s office has provided a safe and secure environment I was very happy to see all of the items implemented to make people safe from each room having an air purifier to the fans running to new suction devices to pick up any spray coming out of your mouth when they’re being cleaned to the personnel ability of the hygienist and the PPE that she had to wear Dr. Chang’s establishment is awesome</text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
It was a little nerve-wracking going to the dentist during COVID but Dr Chang, Dr Amy and their entire team have done a phenomenal job making their office safe for everyone. They’ve put a lot of thought into every aspect from ventilation to staffing, PPE and even air purifiers in every room. It was very reassuring. As usual their dentistry continues to be the very best I’ve found!  We are really lucky to have them here in the Bay Area. If you need help, even now, I’d highly recommend their practice.</review>

<review>Living in San Jose for many years it was difficult to find a reliable and professional dentist here in Hayward area. After at least 4/5 places , I  finally hit Dr. Chang office which  gave peace of mind in every aspect. Thanks Dr. Chang. *****< /review>< pictures>

It’s been just over a year since my last dentist appointment due to the shelter in place because of the coronavirus. I’m happy to report that Dr. Chang’s office has taken all the necessary precautions in order to keep his employees and patients as safe as possible while performing any and all dental procedures. I’m also glad to report that I had no cavities, and look forward to my six month follow up.</Review>

<review>The office is incredibly friendly. I stopped coming here when it was under a different owner. But during the pandemic my dentist from adulthood closed. I returned to this office that I used growing up. I’m so glad I did.  I needed 3 fillings. Dr. Chang, his staff and the office admin were extremely kind warm and patient. I needed extra numbing as I have learned from experience. They listened! I felt no pain and felt silly afterwards for how nervous I got beforehand. I highly recommend Dr. Chang’s office if you’re looking for a dentist.</review>< pics>

I’ve been coming to this office since I was very little, probably for over 15 years. I’ve recently moved to Berkeley but when you find a gem you never want to leave, especially when it comes to your health!</Text>

<Review>Dr. Chang, my dental hygienist Diane, and office staff are wonderful.  I’ve been going to this office for years and I live in Livermore (used to live in Union City). The transition from my former dentists Dr. Barr and Dr. Poindexter (both retired) was seamless.< /Review><Rating>5<//Rating>< Time>

<Text>Me and my husband have been patients for over 30yrs. My children grew up coming to the office as well. Im very pleased with the care we've received  over the years. In the most recent years being under the care of Dr. Chang & his staff, I am very pleased as well. The staff are very caring & professional. They're very accommodating with schedules and sensitive to emergencies. They are very conscientious in taking care of and following healthy clean procedures especially during Covid-19. Im very comfortable being a patient.
I love my dental staff/office.

Dr. Chang and Dr. Chan are the best. They have been our dentists for 20+ years. Myself, my spouse and three children have had nothing but  excellent care. Their front office staff are friendly and professional. The hygienists are also professional, thorough and client centered. Always keeping the patient comfortable. Uma is a sweetheart!

I really trust Dr. Chang and Dr. Chan with our dental care. Again, they are simply the best!!!!< /review>

I have had several fillings done over the years. Only a couple of times did I have to come back to have them immediately ground for a perfect fit. No charges just a quick appointment at my convenience. I believe this is a real test of a Great Dental office. Sometimes it's hard to tell until the anesthesia wears off. The 6 month cleanings are done by expert dental hygienists. Very organized front desk staff and a clean office, I recommend them.<//Text><user_id>103678062054401096730<//user_id>< Time>

I know looking for a new Dentist Office may be hard for someone who has been attending the same one for years like myself, Dr. Leon H. Chang D.D.S. General Dentistry welcomed me with open arms & made me feel comfortable as the last Practice i attended to. Great Service & Keeping you on top of those Beautiful Smiles :)</review>

Stamper made an insurance billing error and tried to bill me for their mistake. If you get insurance authorizations from them, make sure to get it in writing, so you don't run into the same frustration I did!

I'm out the free $180 for the year from my 2019 insurance, because Stamper staff "didn't think it was a big deal". It's incredibly frustrating because I had confirmed with Stamper staff, and both 2019 and 2020 insurance companies, that I was able to take advantage of the contact stipend from both insurances.

TLDR: Steer clear and take your business elsewhere!<//Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x808f7e3eb64bab55:0xcbc41c7b6dafeee6< /Gmap_id></record>

<Text>As a new patient, my first time experience was outstanding. The quality of service I received from Dr. Situ was thorough and he informed me of additional info regarding my eye health. The service from reception to eye exam to eye ware consultation was wonderful. They are pet friendly too. Watching the dogs wait in the seating area with their owners was entertaining and the showroom was clean. I recommend this place.<//Text><Resp>None<//Resp>< Rating>

<Text>Overall I've had the best experience so far in town for prescription glasses. Selection of frames is good, larger than in many other fancier shops; sales assistants are competent, professional, and patient; visits with the optometrists satisfactory and accurate, with detailed and careful explanations; front desk service is corteous and attentive, albeit not the fastest at times because of the high volume of clients. They are also very good at reminding of your appointment. The only reason I'm not giving the full 5 stars is that glasses bought at this, as at any other independent eyeware shop, are always overpriced compared with the "real" value you might get online or at big vix stores. Therefore, 4 stars is as far as you can go with this kind of retail business.<//Text>< UserId.>

Honestly wanted to like this place but I haven't had good experiences with them. Long waits, the glasses seemed overpriced, and they ordered the wrong contact lenses for me. I didn't notice till I got home and opened them, so now have to buy another 3 months of contact lenses.<//review>

Stay away from this terrible, horrible place! Their staff is rude, ghetto and dismissive, unless you buy expensive glasses. They promised a 2-week turnaround for lenses replacement and it has been a month and they're still not ready. They jack up the prices of eyeglasses and sunglasses so high they are so ridiculous! These people are greedy monsters! Let me repeat, stay away from Stamper Optometry!</Text>

The staff at Stamper are knowledgable and incredibly friendly. The Optometrist who examined my daughter (14 years old) was good with her and me, and was able to get the right prescription for her unusual vision. She found the glasses she wanted quickly, too. Great selection. Take the bus because parking isn't easy in the Mission...but Stamper is well worth it!< /text>

<Text>Getting glasses has always been a stressful time for me but when I came in for new prescriptions, I was at ease from the friendly staff despite there being a lot of customers. Everyone was very helpful in explaining my insurance options and suggesting frames that fit my style and budget! There's lots of frame options and brands carried at this store. They're also quick to help with any glasses fitting issues!<//Text>< GmapID>

It was time for an eye exam and since my usual place had gone out of business I was searching for a good, reputable place, preferably in Stamper Optometry that wasn't going to charge me an arm and a leg for an exam.My co-workers immediately told me about Stamper Optometry and how pleased they were with their overall experience.Sometimes word of mouth referrals can be a toss up, but I have got to say that my experience here was a great one! I've received professionalism form the staff from the follow up phone call that I received until the minute I left.The Dr. was very nice, explained to me all the questions and concerns that I had regarding my eyes and I felt very comfortable throughout the entire process. Definitely a wonderful place, I can see why my co-workers praised Stamper Optometry so much and I plan on definitely doing the same thing.</review>

<text>Dr. Hansen was fantastic, and really listened to my work lifestyle to help me decide on glasses to help with my far distance, but also a set of glasses that help reduce the strain on my eyes for long computer work for everyday. However, I had the worst experience with the newer staff member Jessica. At first, things seemed fine and she was helpful in deciding the frames. However, when they arrived, the order was completely wrong. Somehow, the blue light filter, which is only used for reducing blue light from electronics, was put on my distance lenses and in the wrong, cheap frame (since I was not wearing distance glasses every day, I chose a cheaper frame). When I told her this didn't make sense, the blue light would obviously be for close-up glasses for the computer, she proceeded to tell me for 30 minutes how she only writes down what the customer wants, and it was most definitely my fault and NOT her fault at all. Not to mention she didn't mention (or likely even notice) my two frames were two different sizes, and was obviously large on my face. That too was apparently my fault because I picked them out because I liked the design. This is my first set of glasses, so how am I supposed to know how they fit?! Isn't that her job? She NEVER admitted any fault, and told me it was my fault every chance she got. She was very rude and clearly upset at me for the mistake, but never got a manager involved to make sure I was satisfied with how to proceed, and just told me she would send them back (and wouldn't even rush the order. took 2 weeks to get them back). To top it off, they made me pay the $5 difference for clearly their mistake. Someone should have caught that error to begin with if they knew what they were doing (blue light always means electronics and NO ONE is looking at electronics at a long distance). Horrible experience and will never be back. It was a shame too because the doctor, and the staff that helped me afterward (Paul and Jose), were fantastic. If Jessica wasn't sure about the order, she could have asked my freaking DOCTOR, who prescribed the lens and filter, to easily clarify for her.</text><userid>107389062332805014311<//userid></record>

<review>I had a fantastic time at Stamper Optometry! I never imagined that the first Google review I ever wrote would be for an Optometry office, but I had such a wonderful experience, I had to post! The office was very clean, the staff were friendly, and my contacts were estimated to take a week to arrive, but they arrived in a single day! My optometrist was very forthcoming with my prescription (in the past, my old optometrist made it hard for me to attain, I assume to drive more sales through their own frames), so now I can go to other retailers for stylish frames! Now that I write this, I regret not looking at the frames they had in the office...

If you're looking for a new optometrist, you can stop looking, and just choose Stamper. I'm doubtful you'll find a better place!</review>< pictures>

Stamper Optometry is my go to place (over 4+ years) when wanting the experience of great Customer Service and selection of frames and eye health exams. I started coming to Stamper because I am total fan of TOM FORD -- never do they disappoint with the selections from Tom Ford frames, but also great options from L.A. Eyeworks and other designer glasses. The staff is accommodating and patient in helping you find the right pair. In addition, bilingual (Spanish) speakers. Located not far from 24th Street Bart Station. Open early on Saturdays as well. Helpful tip: plan ahead, make an appointment and make sure you have up-to-date info on your eye insurance...and then spend that VSP money!<//text>

I have been meaning to write an update for a while, so here it is...I went for an annual eye exam in the fall of 2012, and the front of house staff seems to have changed.  I was helped by a friendly, professional, gentleman named Jay who was awesome.  There was also a woman there who seemed equally knowledgeable, professional, and friendly, but I didn t get the chance to really interact with her. So, now this place is like the Mary Poppins of eye doctors - practically perfect in every way!</Review>

<review>Dr.  Bruce Stamper is an excellent optometrist and an all around nice guy. His office didn't take exception to my request for a copy of my prescriptions, the way a less ethical shop might. He is the 3rd optometrist I've used in San Francisco and I'll never have need of another!< /review>< pics>

<Text>Stamper Optometry is conveniently located right in the heart of the Mission, has a wonderful attentive, and dedicated staff, and they accept walk-in's .  I can't say enough what a positive experience I had at SO.  I would recommend them to everyone, and including my very own family.<//Text>< pictures>

Had a great experience there. I came in with glasses i bought off the internet, and they helped me adjust the frame to my needs. Also answered a lot of my questions and didn't charge a penny for everything. From the outside it looks a bit dull, but inside you'll find a very competent and helpful team!< /text>

<review>Friendly staff and sales people, though beware they will immediately throw the most expensive frames at you first if you're buying.  Dr. Stamper was informative and friendly.  Prices for exams I think are a little cheaper than elsewhere I looked.  I don't think they have any really cheap frames.  As you can probably tell, money is an issue for me, so spending on new frames/glasses gives me a heart attack.  They did need 2 attempts to get my lenses correctly fabricated, so the nearly month long delay was a bummer,  but that is not something they do on site and they were courteous and prompt about rectifying it.  And I will also say they are willing to be fair when it comes to billing issues, but I'll spare you the details of that.<//review>< user_id>

<review>I have been going for the last 12 years and they are the best!  I used to be prone to eye infections and they found dailies that are strong enough for me.  They are always up to date with the newest and latest technology but still get to know your lifestyle to help you make the right decisions. Certain contacts are not good if you stay up late or forget them for a day.  The staff is great too and Jose will fix your glasses if you drop in.   I highly recommend them!   The optimap system is also great so you don't have to spend hours with the dark sunglasses to dilate your eyes.

Also they were the only ones who were able to help me pick out a frame for glasses where I didn't look completely silly!  10 stars for that.</review>< Pictures>

Given my age, as well as my bad luck, I've had, and currently have, some health problems, but considering my personal situation, I honestly think that I'd prefer to die rather than going blind. Some three years ago, a bit of plaque was found in the inside of one of my eyes. Fortunately,  subsequent examinations revealed that the plaque had just been "deleted." I was always made to feel welcome at Dr. Stamper's; the lovely and knowledgeable crew are all incredible --hey, I don't cook the best "tapa" in the world for just anybody! Perhaps even more important, I always felt fully confident that Dr. Stamper's concern, dedication, and professional know-how would ensure that I'd continue using my eyesight, and avoid above horrible plight.

I honestly give STAMPER OPTOMETRY five stars in every respect, would recommend it without any qualification, and I give them all my heartfelt thanks.

I have long been of fan of Stamper Family Optometry and now more than ever. I'm so happy I found Dr. David of the Stamper Clan. ( Three generations of eye docs in this office since 1913. ) After wearing hard contact lenses since age twelve other doctors told me I'd never be able to wear soft lenses. Dr. David, as opposed to his Uncle, Dr. Bruce (called by their first names to avoid the confusion of having two Doctor Stampers in the same office, ) suggested I take a lens holiday. After six months of only wearing glasses I returned and Dr. David was surprised but excited that my corneas looked nearly normal. Decades of polymer plastic lenses do tend to reshape the eye. Mine bounced back like memory foam! Next we discussed my options. Bi-focal glasses? No. Contacts and reading glasses?  No. What about monocular vision? I dunno. He explained and said it wasn't for everyone but I said I was willing to give it a try.

First he determined my dominate eye. This is the eye you use when looking through the viewfinder on a camera or a rifle for that matter. It usually corresponds to your dexterity. He then fitted my dominant left eye for distance vision. Then my right eye was fitted for close-up. He said some people know within an hour if they can do it or not. I was required to stay on the premises for an hour in the event I was one of those people who get nauseous or dizzy. I must say at first the concept alone almost made me cross-eyed but now I think of it as the Poor Man's Lasik Surgery. I could read the clock on a building a block away, I could read the tiny print in a text message and was relieved I didn't have to fumble about for my "reading glasses" to wear over my contacts like I had been doing for way too long.

I was hooked in the first fifteen minutes. No integration issues for my brain!  I don't miss seeing things in stereo, in fact my sight seems to be the best it's ever been and the contacts feel like a dream compared to the old school blind child hard lenses I endured for decades. Dr. David s a great find, he specializes in the "hard to fit" eye. The multi-lingual staff is another big plus. Jhosy got me up to speed on soft lens insertion and removal including a special tip for us "long-nailed" girls. Sweet Esmerelda gave me the visual  test; while Jose was busy tightening my sunglasses that were slipping down my nose but took it a step further and replaced the screw! Sixteen employees, some there ten to twenty years, multi-tasking with the synchronicity of a Swiss watch in their daily routine. The customer service and commitment to the patient's satisfaction is outstanding!</review>

This store is my go to kinda place. Most everything you need is stocked in shelves and if not just ask the owner cuz he is most accommodating this store is so clean and organized the prices alone should have you making this Your ONLY local neighborhood to shop at. The owner and small staff are so friendly, helpful and welcoming it is so refreshing and alot of fun. You will love it I'm serious. Oh and again THE PRICES the best around. Love, Love, Love Check it Out!!!!<//Review>

<review>I really love this grocery shop! The ambiance is very amazing, security guards are very helpful, there is a PWD lane which is a must-have for every establishment, and not crowded. You can get everything you need here at a very affordable price. This is my fave grocery shop when I am in a hurry. Highly recommended!</review><rate>5< /rate>< user_name>

This Grocery shop was a big help for my needs. Everything I badly need last Monday was all right here. I was able to make the things that I should be done. I don't know what to do if I didn't find this awesome place. I will definitely be going to tell all of my co-workers and friends on how great this shop was. Job well-done guys!</Text>

The store was clean organized and actually looked good and well stocked.was laid out good to be as spacious as could for the size of the store.The only bad thing that I would have to say about it is that they didn't have any chocolate milk.Plenty of regular milk though.i would definitely go back there again.< /Review>

This is the best small grocery store in San Francisco.  Moe and the staff always have the BEST munchies to snack on. Always clean and prices are very reasonable. If you dont want to deal with the long lines at the supermarket, stop by Downtown Grocery.</Review>

I freaking love this place the man there is that owns it is awesome and definitely promote any day everyday the jolly rancher slushies are the best ever best slushies in San Francisco I should say come visit downtown grocery really good prices only place I know that have the two for a dollar cookies and their prices are really fair and workable and if you have a favorite item that they don't have they would definitely order it to make sure that you can come and visit them they're very awesome high energy and leave you smiling when you visit</review>

<text>Although it's recently opened, the man always working there is Rude and aggressively hostile to the transgender community in which he's placed his shop. For pulling my dog away from Peking on his door, he came yelling at a "sick freako Sissy maggot" (not me! I'm legally and medically a woman) it's more constant in the area than police activity from the station across the corner from his hateful business.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x8085808ff8f5a951:0xa1ef27382373bc61< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I always choose this corner store in my neighborhood The owner and especially his brother Mo make you feel very welcome when you enter their store they have a wide variety of items and if you cant find what youre looking for they quickly get the info and are sure to order whatever it is for the next time you come there, Their prices are also better than their competitors, and the sore is hands down the cleanest store in this neighborhood<//Review>

<Review>This is a small single floor motel, it is clean, quite and cozy..  it is conveniently located near the north off ramp in Dunsmuir, which is where the Hedge Creek waterfall is located.  You can either walk from the motel or drive the quarter mile to the gravel parking lot.  The motel was inexpensive, there are several places to eat in the downtown area, about a mile away.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Love the bird aviary and koi pond just steps from our room. Those nature/water sounds completely blocked any street noise. We had a bit of trouble with the wall heater (wouldn’t turn off) and they immediately brought us a portable heater (silent and effective). Recommend room #8 at the end of bldg. very nice staff. Very clean.</Review><Name>Expedia reviewer</Name>< resp>

This place has a very calming charm to it.  Aviery with koi fish pond outside. Went out for a hike, came back and the bed was made and toiletries were refreshed.  Front desk guy & room servers were bery friendly.  Extremely close to Moss Brae Falls....a gorgeous waterfall. ❤ Thank You Cedar Lodge< /review>

<rate>None<//rate><review>It was just OK. I wanted to love this place and from the outside it's so charming. The rooms are actually a good size. It's just so funky. Old carpet that you don't really want to walk on barefoot. Don't get me wrong, it was clean... Just so old. Old decor, curtains and bedding. It wouldn't take much to spruce this room up and it would make a world of difference.< /review>< gmapID>

Walls are very thin, and we had to listen to very noisy neighbors. A/C unit is a little noisy, but it was better than the neighbors. We would go back though, and hopefully have better neighbors next time.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

The property was clean and maintained nicely amidst the trees and shades.  One of our kind bed rooms has amazing long pillows that were very comfortable, a pleasant surprise.</Text>

I love this place. Dunsmuir alone is beautiful.  Cedar Lodge is a mountain lodge. Very peaceful here and also has a bird avery.  I've been here twice now will will always stay here when I come. It was my boys and I and I felt completely safe. I highly recommend Cedar Lodge.< /Text>

<Review>The motel is just so so. Room was very small, we barely had enough space for luggage - we had 3 carry on.

Towels and bedding look outdated. We stripped theirs and replaced with our sheets and pillow cases.

The motel had no vacancy on the day of our stay. We were a little worried about how they keep social distance and sanitize the place. There was no hand sanitizer at front desk and people don't wear masks inside the office.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Due to sudden unforeseen circumstances I had to leave Dunsmuir right after paying for a night here (I was still in the office and it was midday). The lodge printed a receipt that showed the charge and the refund. Only the refund never appeared (this was 11 weeks ago). Only the charge remains on my credit card and the lodge keeps telling me to check with my bank. Avoid fraud, don’t stay here.< /Review>

<review>Rooms were nothing special but not bad. It was quiet and service was pleasant. I especially enjoyed the bird Avery near our room as it was unique and fun activity to watch the birds for a bit. The location is just a couple minutes from downtown Dunsmuir so it worked out perfect as a quick overnight stay.<//review><user_name>Nicholas Dominguez<//user_name>< userid>

Clean, affordable, basic motel.  Didnt have interaction with front desk or staff after I checked in but the owners were courteous and prepared for my arrival.  Also the maid service was very thorough.  There is some freeway noise but I ran the A/C all night and adjusted the temperature setting and the fans white noise mostly drowned out all freeway noise.<//Review>

The rooms are clean, beds are comfortable and the cleaning staff friendly and professional. We stayed there a total of 5 days 3 on our way down to Los Angeles and 2 on our trip back home to Washington State.This is a peaceful getaway, quiet and set in a magical forrest surrounded by  positive energy.

<review>Very clean and cozy little getaway. The owner is very nice. She made sure that my family had everything we needed including an extra blow up bed when our daughter at the last minute decided to join us for the holiday so she would not have to sleep on the floor. Thank you for providing exceptional service. My wife cleans houses and daughter cleans hotels and they both commented on how clean the room was. For me I noticed  the bed was comfy and The sheets are soft. Give this a place a try..<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

< Review>
I had booked a king bed room on Orbitz for our stay however upon checking in to the motel, we were given a room with 2 double beds as no king bed rooms were available. The room was superbly clean, but keep in mind, this is an OLD motel and it is very close to I-5. The staff is pleasant but there is smoking available outside the rooms and we had people on either side of us sitting at the tiny table and chairs outside their room smoking, so anytime we go in or out of our room, were going through a wall of cigarette smoke. Mind you, these arent complaints or opinions, just facts that visitors should know about before booking the motel. The aviary was neat to see - quite a few small, colorful parrots and a number of cockatiels flying and squawking helped drown out the I-5 noise. The birds are mostly quiet after dark, but they do start their noise early in the morning. We were in the room on the opposite side of where the birds were and we could hear em probably around 6 AM. An you cant really hear I-5 noise, save for a rumbling semi trucks here and there. That being said, Dunsmuir is a beautiful, quiet, off the beaten path town and for a reasonable, not too loud, older motel, Cedar Lodge Motel is just fine. There is a hikable waterfall within a short walk from the motel, and it was a great option for visiting Mount Shasta. Its not too far of a drive to see Shasta and you save a TON of $$$ by not staying in the area of Mount Shasta. Its a better option in the area.</Review>

We didn't stay here as unfortunately my husband got sick the night we were supposed to drive up. Vince at the front desk was amazing, not only did he cancel my booking with no charge but we had a great chat. He made us feel fine about cancelling and welcome for when we come back, he told me all about the services the motel provides and the surrounding area. Although we didn't stay this was absolutely fantastic customer service- we will surely visit soon.< /Text>

<text>The hotel was easy to find, right off of the interstate. The staff was really nice. I was interested in walking to the falls, which was close by. The room was not fancy, but had everything that one would want to be comfortable- and included a microwave and refrigerator. I would stay here again if in the area.

<text>Great price for a place to rest. Amazing location, clean rooms, but the bed was really squeaky, so I had a hard time sleeping. The outdoor seating/dining area next to the unique aviary was a very nice touch.< /text><username>Tonya Jasper</username>< Pics>

Wonderful staff. Extremely accommodating and hospitable. I stayed with my 2 dogs and they were very friendly and happy to have us with them. Great parking. The outdoor grills and picnic area is nice.  They have an aviary with some very neat birds which is novel (no, they don't squawk and keep you awake). A very laid back attitude which I enjoyed greatly.

_________edited after checkout_____

On the day of checkout there was an older woman who seemed to be the owner around. The positive and friendly vibe flipped completely on its head. Instead of being a welcoming and accommodating stay it felt more like we were unwanted and being rushed out. We were the only 3 guests staying at the time and we were told that we could not use the ice machine because the other guests would need ice. She had a worker blowing leaves and dirt at us while we loaded up our trucks with out luggage in an effort to hurry us out.  While we were finishing loading the woman who I assume is the maid came. We had already checked out of one room and got the luxury of watching them clean the other one. It took them maybe 5 minutes to do the whole thing. Basically the changed the sheets and replaced the toilet paper. :/

Vince was the only pleasant employee and if it was just him we dealt with I would have had a much better experience.</text>

We stayed in a suite that had a kitchen. Suite was big and clean but very cold. There was 1 heater in living area, heater in the bathroom and a portable radiator in the bedroom. They did the job though and we eventually warmed up. The beds were extremely uncomfortable and we didnt get very good sleep. On the outside of our bedroom wall was an ice maker which was quite loud. We heard people getting ice more than once. It was fine, but next time will probably stay in Shasta to be closer to Ski Park.< /review>

< Review>
This place had the most comfortable bed that I slept on ever, in any Motel and I don't believe I've ever seen a shower that white, Even a five-star luxury Motel in Las Vegas. The staff were kind and gracious when our 32 year-old daughter decided to join us unexpectedly they just said "okay! we have an air mattress would you like to use it?" The Aviary was pretty cool, it is all rescued Birds mostly conures and Cockatiels.<//Review>

Quaint and quiet motel.  We were near some other motels closer to Mt Shasta city and mountain and you can hear the train.  At this motel,  you'd have to be outside and still not be able to hear the train over a parked electric car. They are a dog friendly motel. The whole area is shaded by large trees which was a welcome relief when we arrived and it was over 100°F outside.  Oh,  almost forgot,  the rooms were very clean.  Even though it seems half of the people staying there had dogs,  no animal smell whatsoever in the rooms.  Not a single dog hair when we arrived. I was amazed.  I have a mild animal allergy. I can't sit on a couch a dog or cat uses and i didn't even get a nose tickle.  Whatever they do,  they clean very well.
In closing,  we enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay here again.  There were minor issues like (being a journeyman carpenter) the door to our room rubbed the frame slightly.  But that isn't things i haven't seen elsewhere and it wasn't bad. i have spent more at other hotels and have had to fix doors myself. So the minor issues are specific to my field of expertise and no one else in my party noticed. So,  again,  we'll definitely be staying here again. No pool but no train either.  That train is loud at some other places closer to the tracks.<//Review>

Tiny room with hard as rock beds. Nothing at all to say good.

<Review>This is Vince the front desk manager I can assure you that the only bad review on here is completely false and is probably someone I'm competing with. Expedia tripadvisor and every other site you can find you will not read such a comment but the complete opposite. I take pride in my job and go over and beyond I'm mentioned by name and am known to be very nice even late night check in I do this 24hr a day and have never did such a thing as I'm accused of and I've been here two years and only one person says such a lie while all else says how great i am so use your better judgement and come see for yourself it's a lie not even going to mention such nonsense I'm the one people mention by name or speak very highly of me I'm doing better than some in town and truly belive that comment was put there on purpose to ruin my reputation but as I said you can read all comments with all sites and only one remotely says such a thing like this. Im the one who cuts heat on digs cars out known to be very respectful and attentive as many comments say the same time this lie was said someone else gave me praise on my service so use commen since people and know when someone is doing better than them they will say anything like this. If that was so others would have mentioned the same but there is only that one I know better and people who stay here regularly know better. The comment is so far off from what people say about me on a regular basis that whoever said it wasn't thinking straight cause they are all alone with that accusation while other bad comments with other motels are consistent and more than one. I will keep doing my job best I can and keep getting great reviews about me personally and the motel. Look forward to seeing and meeting all who decides to stay here and can promise you you won't feel anything like this only bad but untruthful comment but like every other person says about me which is nothing but good things. Remember not all you read on the Internet is true and this one lonely comment is definitely not. I've did my research and the name lynn skunner is nowhere to be found on Google Facebook or any search engine this is 2016 you can't hide and the word skunner means to dislike in some parts of the world once again this is a false statement someone trying to bring us down wasn't a guest or it would be on a booking site not where just anyone rather stayed or not can post what they want it's not right or true but I know comments that contradict this mystery persons comment will continue to far out way this clearly bad planned comment to ruin out reputation.

<Text>It's not a luxurious stay but the on-site manager was very kind, the towels were fluffy, the TV and heater and shower worked well. There is a fridge and microwave and a coffee maker in the room too. I'd stay again for the price< /Text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) A cozy and simple place. Good accommodations and furniture. Taking into account that it is located in a little busy site and that was affected by fires in response to weather conditions, the price was a little higher than I thought. Without so it has a considerable price quality ratio

Un sitio acogedor y sencillo. Buenas acomodaciones y mobiliario. Teniendo en cuenta que está localizado en un sitio poco concurrido y que estuvo afectado por incendios atendiendo a las condiciones climatológicas, el precio fue un poco más elevado de lo que pensaba.

I called in today for an auto insurance quote and was helped by Nadia. She was very helpful and informative.  She was patient with me and gave me different options for my quote and making sure she didn’t miss any discounts I qualified for.  The office is bilingual if you’re looking for a Spanish speaker.  I would definitely recommend this office for your insurance needs!</review>

<Review>I have been with Julios agency over 10 years and the service has been nothing less than exceptional. They cover all of my blanket policies from life and p&c. I also have coverage with other carriers, which are nothing compared to the service that I have received from State Farm. They go above and beyond to make my experience as painless as possible. They are always available to answer a questions and assist with any issues promptly. I look forward to continuing my relationship with a great agency.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<review>Julio’s office is the most responsive and helpful insurance office I can imagine. I have been with State Farm since I have been a licensed driver and they have always given me a personalized and family oriented experience. After a traumatic car accident when my twins were 2 weeks old, Julio took the time to speak with me after hours and help me through the process. His team is always kind and you can hear them smiling on the phone! If you are looking for an honest insurance agent don’t look any further!<//review>< Name>

This office and all of the agents here are amazing! Always responsive and incredibly helpful. I have my car, renters and life insurance with them. Julio Martinez and his team make an excellent insurance team. They’re always there to answer all of my insurance questions.

I’ve recommended them to several friends and family and I highly recommend making the switch to Julio Martinez State Farm for your insurance needs!< /text>

<Review>So this is what happen!! Caught a flat on highway 4 east bound. Pulled over and pulled out my phone I have 10% battery left and No where close to where I’m familiar with the city. Made one phone call on a Saturday afternoon, my agent doesn’t answer I mean that normal after business hours right. But the 5 star review comes from the call back!! Now Julio expresses he was at a little get together and seen he missed my call and wanted to just make sure everything was okay. Well it definitely wasn’t lol I needed help ASAP. When he heard what was happening with my new bike that I just added coverage to he called roadside for me and gave my location and said to sit tight well when my battery died and I was on the side of the freeway I had no other choice but to do that. After someone stopped and let me use their phone charger he had been sending me texts with updates!! Long story short this man went out of his way on his day off while at a party to help his customer! After being a customer if his for the long 5 plus years he can certainly count on me to be with his company for another 5 plus years! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ customer service<//Review></record></dataset><record>

When it comes to insurance I take it pretty seriously because one accident without the right car insurance coverage could be life altering. Julio and his team make insurance easy to understand and even easier to delegate our financial services too so we can worry about our lives without the worry of not being covered for something. Due to that we also trust Julio Martinez State Farm with our families Life Insurance plan and our Renters insurance combine that with our umbrella policy and my family has a well designed protection plan so when the worsts happens we can focus on what really matters with the confidence that Julio and his team made sure we had the protection we needed.< /Text>

Julio Martinez and his team are INCREDIBLE!!!! My favorite story is when I was buying a new car and needed insurance info, Julio hopped on the computer and sent over what I needed immediately. Did I mention it was after business hours? He always goes above and beyond for his clients! We have every vehicle insured through him (State Farm), along with our Home Owner's Insurance Policy. Every time I call his office line, I am always greeted professionally and they are quick to assist me. I highly reccommend Julio Martinez as an Insurance Agent!</review>

I’ve been with Julios agency for 5+ years now. The staff there are always so friendly and helpful.  Anytime I  call in with question, concerns or in need of a quote they are always on their A game.  Nadia is my go to girl, she is always on top of her things and always does it with a smile.  I recently called in to get a quote on Life Insurance for the newest member of my family.  She walked me through the whole process without any issues.  If you need any insurance needs go to Julio Martinez’s office in Pittsburg!< /Text>

I went in to get a quote after getting a great lunch at Panda Express and instantly I was greeted with smiles.  Julio's team are very kind and know their stuff.  I got my quote and 10 min later I walked out with auto, renters, and LIFE insurance AND I was able to get a credit card and checking acct through them.  Thank you Julio for the great ideas, great service, and great coverage's.  We'll talk 401k rollover soon!  love my new one stop shop!< /Review>

Best insurance office in East County! Go see Julio and his wonderful team for all your insurance and financial services needs! He is located in the heart of Pittsburg near the Mi Pueblo shopping center on Railroad Ave. I recommend them to anyone out there looking for auto, renters, life, and health insurance.< /review>

< review>
I work for State Farm in Las Vegas, NV and every time I have a current client or a potential client moving to Pittsburg area I always recommend Julio Martinez and his office first. When I follow up with my referrals, after they have been handled by his office the customers constantly have the most wonderful experience. At Julio's office, it's more than just an insurance transaction with their customers. Their service is top notch to say the least. Julio the agent, his staff members Belen, Nadia, and Francisco are continuously making sure my referrals are happy, knowledgeable on the product and getting the best price for their insurance needs. I  have never had a bad experience with them, and I continue to send them business! Definitely a great team to deal with!</review>

GGlighting went above and beyond for me. I purchased a light bar from this company at a offroad parts show about a year ago for a 4runner. I ended up getting a larger truck (ram rebel) and came into the shop recently to see if I could exchange to a larger size. Upon installation, the team found that the brackets weren't quite compatible with the door slot and the fitment wouldn't be appropriate. They could have just as easily installed it and I wouldn't have known the difference. They were up front and honest before even attempting installation. The owner Cody even offered to pay for custom fabrication on his own dime. I ultimately decided to pass on it but Cody still refunded my money. He even helped offload the original light bar I had to another interested customer. There was a lot they did for me and I'm sincerely grateful. They may get busy at times but I fully believe the Owner Cody is committed to doing the best for his customers.< /Review>

This place is OUTSTANDING.  We found them highly recommended by the Jeep and off-road forums.  They quickly answered our call and all our questions.  They were quick to schedule our install and did an outstanding installation of both the lights we bought from them as well as the brackets and other pieces that we bought online and took into them.  They were there when we scheduled and had the job done early on the same day.  This sort of service is what I expect but unfortunately is lacking in our modern online world.  They had in-store displays and a wide range of lights to choose from. Bottom line--I cannot recommend GGLighting enough.  They are a find and their products and service are outstanding.<//review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I would definitely recommend these guys. I bought lights from them with the intentions of installing them myself. But just don't have the time. I called them in the morning, took my jeep in and they installed them for me. Very reasonable labor charge and my Jeep was done the same day. Their customer service is awesome.< /Review>< Pics>

I would give them ZERO stars if I had the option. I bought a pair of roof mounts for my 50" bar. I tried installing the mounts but the holes were completely off and there was an issue with the hardware that they wanted me to use. I talked to one of their reps over the phone and I even sent him pictures of the problem. He said he would get back to me. Since then, I have called them multiple times, sent them text messages and even left them voice messages. I have not heard anything back from them. They have completely ignored me.

If you add something to your basket on their site, they will repeatably send you emails of discounts and text messages asking about how can they assist you in ordering. Well once you buy it, they could care less if you have problems!

TERRIBLE COMPANY!! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!< /Review>

Not sure about all the negatives but that has NOT been my experience at all. Came in with a new Cherokee looking for  mounting suggestions and a bit of education in the LEDs ( I am from the KC Day-lighter era)

The guys were helpful and we decided on a course of action. I had a 30 inch bar installed which sounds simple but really wasn't since I wanted a super clean installation & they were mounting it onto a Yakima roof rack on a new vehicle. It got done quickly and the cost was quite reasonable and the installation was and is exactly what I wanted. Next up is a small pod for the back of the rack.

Bottom line: No complaints on my part at all. I am an old guy and if I thought I was getting hosed I would not hesitate to call BS. I'm happy with what they have done and that's why I am going back.</review>

I was able to get a 50" bar installed on my truck with less than 24 hours notice. Flawless installation in a timely manner and I was on my way. Great company. Not sure why so many people are giving one star reviews. I worked in a service industry for a while and many many people would order the wrong parts online and complain when we didnt bend over backwards to fix their problem for them. Almost like they expect people to bend over forwards for them, something I avoid at all costs.< /Text>

I bought my first light bar from gg almost two years ago. I love it! it puts out tons of light. The mounts and wiring came with it everything was super easy to install. After all this time I haven't seen any cracks or moisture on the glass. I now have 8 light bars all different sizes. Gglighting makes a great light worth every penny!< /review>

Absolute worst customer service!!!!! I had ordered light bar brackets from this company and when they arrived one had shown up defective. It took me a week to get someone to answer the phone and I was told to send them pictures of the defective product. I sent them the pictures right away and was expecting the new bracket in the mail. After a week of not hearing anything I tried contacting them via phone text message Instagram and email with no call back or anything. Due to the bracket not sitting straight it caused it to leak into my truck. Once I finally got a hold of them on a friends phone they said they had tried to send out a new bracket but it got sent back to them. Due to me living in Washington it rains a lot which means constantly making sure my truck is not leaking I even paid extra money for two day shipping on the replacement part and it still hasn't shown up. My advice to you go spend your money somewhere else. To much of a hassle to deal with this company it's not worth your time or frustration<//Text>

I was a bit hesitant to order from them after a few of the bad reviews, granted they did have quite a few good reviews but was still hesitant. They had a set of used brackets for my truck on there website so I decided to buy them for half the cost of new ones they had listed. I ordered them got a email the next day with a tracking number and they showed up and are just as advertised. I would not for a second hesitate ordering anything from them.<//Text>

<review>Definitely one of the most solid light bar companies I've ever dealt with. Great product and very good customer service. I'm not local to this company and I've still had a good experience with them and have had no problems at all. I've purchased alot of their products. I bought a light bar from them that arrived to me damaged through UPS. Called them up and they told me to do a UPS damaged freight claim, I did so and it got shipped back to them. Before they received the light bar back to their facility, they sent a replacement light bar to me immediately. I recommend this company to everyone I know who is looking to throw lighting on their vehicles. Everyone who I've shown their light bars to is instantly sold on the performance of them. Plenty of my friends run Rigid and Gglighting stands side by side with them no problem. They aren't selling some cheap knock off products.< /review>< gmapID>

<Text>Ordered a G4D 40inch lightbar week before Halloween weekend for my XP4 1000 and got it the next day with free shipping. I was concerned it said it would take 5 days to process order to I had it checked for them to call me before shipping. They made sure it went out immediately and he upgraded the light for my RZR. Awesome company would recommend these light bars to everyone. Beyond stoked this light bar is extremely bright and solid.

Ordered a flashlight on there website, waited a week for tracking number, never got anything. Called and they said they were out of stock and would ship out in a week. Called back 2 weeks ago and same story, months passed by and directly talked to them in person at the Pomona Off road Expo 2017, said they were having a problem with the company they get them and would ship out in a week. Well now it’s  June 2018 and still no word, save your money spend a little more and buy from other company’s, at least they’ll give you what you paid for.</text>

DONT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!!!! Terrible customer service!! if you like ordering things and not getting your full order then this is your place. this company is terrible I tried talking to the guy and getting the rest of my order but he just ignores me and wont get back to me. I even tried contacting him and said that I wanna get this worked out because I like ordering from companies that give military discount and I have a lot of business I can send his way and he still just ignores me.<//review>

The 1 star reviews on here have to be a joke because I have never had any problems what so ever with GG Lighting.  I would never use a lighter from any other company if they offered it to me for free.  I love giving these guys my business because they are hard working Americans who want to give a truly good product to people.  I currently have their lights on multiple vehicles off road and work.  I wish i could give them more than five stars because my experience with these guys is more than I could ask for.  They offer lighting that is better than rigid and all those other companies that charge more than anyone should ever pay for lighting and it is half the cost.

Who ever rated 1 star is crazy. I came in to get a 50 inch curved light bar that had no mounts and a bad wire. These guys mounted it and wired it with new wires in a professional way. And thats how it should be at an offroad lighting place. Im stoked on the mounts and the job they performed on my truck.</review>

I would give this no stars but it won't post unless you mark a star! DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY IF YOU DON'T LIVE IN THE AREA WHERE THEY ARE LOCATED. We live in the midwest and my son ordered a light bar for his truck from this company. It didn't fit so we returned it within the 7 day period and they confirmed they received it back after multiple phone calls trying to see if they had gotten it back and we wanted our refund. We called almost daily for 2 weeks and now when we call no one will even answer the phone. We leave a message to call us back on their answering machine and they do not return our calls. We have been dealing with this since May 4th and it is now mid August. They still haven't refunded our money for the purchase we made of $386.06. This company is unlike any I have ever dealt with. They sure do not stand behind their website which states (and I quote): "If you are not 100% satis fied with your purchase of our products, please let us know what we can do to help you out! We are very willing to work with our customers and we are always there to listen to you, our valued customer!" YEAH RIGHT!! I've sent emails, called daily, and I get no one to answer or respond.< /Review>

Ordered some lights, was told that for sure they would be delivered between April 1st through the 5th. I asked about it on their Instagram page, was told they would ship on time. Here it is the 15th and I finally got my ordered, only after messaging them twice, the second time threatening to call my credit card company to get my money back. No apologies for the delay or anything, the only response to any of my messages "order number please" Hopefully these "Lifetime Warranty" light never go out so I don't have to deal with this company again. Better off spending the extra money and ordering from Rigid Industries next time. Would not recommend this company</Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Review>As a Google Local Guide I am here to provide a solid and true review, this company has very bad customer service and business ideals. I will never recomend this company to any of my offroad club members , friends or family luckily I did find a company that is willing to really take care of all our lighting needs. Just look at all there bad reviews and just with that you will deside on where to buy or what company to use. I really hate giving bad reviews but they really deserve it. I really hope that they take reviews and customers more seriously and progress in there customer service. It might not be the owners fault sometimes its the bad employees that they hire that gives them a bad name, but thats why they should be on top of all there business areas. I really hope one day they change there ways and provide better service.<//Review>< pictures>

<time>1486229066480</time><rate>1< /rate><text>These people deserve to be arrested  especially the owner for letting this happen!!!! They don't even deserve one star. This business needs to be shut down!!! Don't buy anything from these people they are fraudulent and will take your money!!!! I ordered a pair of their brackets it took a while to get which was ridiculous, and soon as I got them the box was tore open because they were not packaged correctly and the brackets were damaged. I went on and called and asked what I should do, "they said file a claim through UPS". When I showed the UPS man he said "they probably won't do anything because it was the shippers fault for not packaging them correctly". So I waited for a week for a response from GGlighting and never received a call so I tryied getting ahold of them and they would never answer the phone they would only text and I would get the same response "you need to file a claim through ups" or that "we have not received the brackets yet". So as a week went on I tried calling and texting some more and never got any response they started ignoring my calls and text. So for more than a month trying to get ahold of this company as they ignore my calls and text and me not knowing if I was going to get new brackets or my money back, I finally got ahold of a sponcor on instagram which he was nice and got ahold of the of the company for me which got me in contact with them. When I started talking to them they said "they have not received the brackets from ups and I still need to make a claim", they were lying to me the whole time because I started calling them out and they finally agreed to refund my money which I finally got thank god.

DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS CONPANY THEY ARE  FRAUDULENT AND WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY!!!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. don't waste your time and definitely not your hard earned money. The one guy in the back seems normal but the Oompa Loompa with girl ear rings and man friendly goatee is just a flat out liar...he must be Cody according to other reviews. Sold me and my friend both WRONG  bracketts for our vehicles that we told him we drive make and model trucks. Then complains about wanting a return. How dumb are you? Your lights suck to btw spend the money but not with these guys.< /Text>

Ordered a few things on June 22, 2015 and received them finally on July 5th after calling numerous time to see when they'd be shipped, then to be told they got shipped out which was a lie. So then I get my shipment only to find out that not everything I ordered was there. Then I install the G3 pods to only notice that one is faulty and is dis colored. So I call again and they say send a picture, which I do. Now I don't get a respond after calling, texting and emailing them.

The Newport Beach Minuteman Press is THE BEST place to get all of your printing needs done!! Henry is so friendly, efficient, knowledgable, and prompt! He keeps me updated throughout our whole printing process, making sure to call and get approval for any revisions needed. They get their work done SO QUICKLY, their prices are SO much cheaper than any place I've worked with, and their customer service is not even comparable to anywhere in the area! YOU ROCK MINUTEMAN PRESS! Thank you!!<//Text>

Henry and his team are so accommodating. We know that we can be difficult and confusing customers at time, but he's always willing to make changes and work with us as needed. The quality is always great and he personally brings in samples when he can to make sure we are happy before moving to production. They truly do live up to their Minuteman name and always turn things around sooner than promised. Highly recommend!<//Review>

<text>I was skeptical at first as no other printing services in the area could finish my project in the time I needed. Talked to Henry at Minuteman Press and he told me "No Problem" he had it finished under the time he quoted. They do amazing work and things other printing establishments cannot do. Henry even has out of state clients because he delivers faster than even they can locally in their states. Just have to say this was a great experience, best customer service anywhere. This is my new go to spot!<//text>< pictures>

I was very impressed with the personalized service provided by the owner, Henry.  This was my first time using Minuteman Press but I am already working on ordering personalized greeting cards, envelopes and deposit slips for our company.  I am also impressed by the scope and variety of products that are available.  Henry has earned my business!  Update as of 12/10/18 - I have now had multiple jobs completed and continue to be impressed with this company.  I highly recommend them!< /Review>

Best dentist ever:) everybody from a receptionist to dentists is super kind and they pay attention to the details like lip balm care before they  ask me to open my mouth! (Often some places they don’t apply lip balms unless you ask). While doing cleaning I felt asleep since it was really good feeling! Thank you so much everybody!!!< /text>

Dr. Muradian and his staff are as good as can be. In the time of virus they have stepped up their game. I couldn't have felt more comfortable given all the protocol and mitigation they have put in place to keep the staff and patients safe. That is a lot of hard work and they have stepped up. And excellent dentistry as always. Dr. Muradian is more than a top-notch dentis, he is an artist.</Text>

Found the staff and the doctor to be attentive and knowledgeable. The office was very calm and soothing like a spa with no spa water.  The rooms have a pretty park view. The hygienist was sweet and kind she pointed out good tips to keep my teeth clean and white.  The doctor was accommodating and gentle. I consider this to be a local gem.  Definitely will return and continue to refer.<//text>

<review>TOP NOTCH!!! I have been a patient of Doctor Muradian for over 10 years. I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed with his work or his staff. Everyone is helpful & friendly. His office is very nice & clean. I've had plenty of dental work over the years, and they make the experience as pleasurable as possible. He is kind & very caring of his patients. Karee is my hygentist & does an excellent cleaning. Do yourself a favor & go to Doctor Muradian's office for your next check-up, cleaning, or any of your dental needs.<//review>< date>

Today I had my semi annual cleaning appt. with Dr Muradian's dental hygienist, Simon'.
I have been going to her for a few years now and I have always found her to be professional, friendly, gentle, and a good conversationalist. I always leave there pain free, with my mouth feeling refreshed. Everyone at the office is friendly and courteous and meets you with a smile.
If you need a cleaning and Simon' is not available, rest assured that Tonya shares the same great qualities as Simon'.< /Text>

Best dentist office I’ve been to. The staff is always friendly and professional. They even offered headphones so I could listen to music on my phone while I was in the chair. Love the atmosphere of the office. Dr. Muradian is great! He’s very quick but also does a great job. Appointments have always been right on time, I’ve never waited more than 5 mins in the waiting room. They really go the extra mile! Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a positive experience. I won’t go anywhere else! Dr. Muradian has called me personally after each visit to follow up and see how I’m doing.<//Review>

<Review>I have spent alot of time in a Dentist chair- most of it was miserable. Dr. Muradian, and his staff have completely changed my thoughts when it comes to dental work. Every experience I have had at this office has been above, and beyond. Dr. Muradian has set a new standard in Dentistry.

I am very pleased with Dr. Muradian’s proffesional advice and recommendations on my first visit.  He clearly stated my options on a very complicated situation.< /review>

<Time>1439105802674</Time><rate>5</rate><Text>My family and I have been patients of Dr. Muradian for over 8 years.  The first time I saw him was for an emergency root canal.  I was leaving for vacation the next day and needed help immediately as I was in a lot of pain.  He was able to fix my tooth and even called that night to see how I was before I left for vacation.  That is patient care at it's finest.  All work I have had since, there is always a call that evening from Dr. Muradian to check on me.  All of his assistants have been great. Tanya has been cleaning my teeth for a few years now and is very caring and thorough.  His front office staff is welcoming and professional.  I highly recommend Dr. Muradian and his office for all your dental needs.<//Text>< pics>

<Date>1416075624829</Date><Response>None</Response><review>This was my first appointment here. The service I came in for was to replace a crown that had come off. Every staff member was very nice and inclusive with every aspect of my visit. The office is very clean and modern looking. The amenities to take your mind off of dental work, such as hundreds of movies, iPod music, or even a massaging chair were offered to me in a leather binder, much like a menu at a fine restaurant.
Obviously that wouldn't mean a thing if Dr. Muradian's work wasn't up to par. I can assure you he is a very skilled Doctor with a demeanor like you were talking to your favorite relative.
He was very patient, explaining everything he was about to do, which by itself was far more than the original dentist did that put in the crown.
Finally, something completely unexpected happened the day after my visit. Dr. Muradian called me at home to see how I was feeling! I don't know about anyone else, but this is the first time that has ever happened to me with any doctor. Usually they leave you with the statement, "call me if you get worse" or something like that. That simple call left me with the feeling that he really does care about his patients more than anyone Ive encountered, and for all the reasons above, took the time to write this review so that others will know just how good Dr. Muradian and his staff are!<//review><Name>joemandoo<//Name></record></dataset><record>

Office staff is very friendly and professional. Treatment plans are thoroughly explained, well layed-out, and estimated costs are provided. I've had cleanings, fillings, crowns, and a root canal at Dr. Muradian's office and all have been good experiences. I'm not a person who's afraid of the dentist but I don't like having work done either. Dr. Muradian has always been sensitive to my nervousness while getting the work done and I've walked away from the experinces feeling positive. I would recommend this dentist and the office, in general.</text>

Now thats service!!!  My kids used to go to the Spaceship Dentist and once they started going to Dr. Muradian they didnt want to go back and they get movie tickets or Cherry on Top G/C!!!! And i did watch movies every time i had a lengthy procedure done!!! Would recommend to everyone!!!!< /text>< username>

Loved the food. Thought I ordered just enough to feed five and we recieved so much that we FEASTED. Had a variety of rolls and two different styles of ramen. Definitely check them out if your in the area and in the mood for sushi.<//text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Excellent place to get a nice meal for cheap. I typically go the their Udon, which is a great, filling meal if you have time in between classes.
The staff here are also friendly and quick.
The atmosphere here is quaint, nothing too fancy and that's what I love about this place.
Would recommend this place to anyone who wants to break away from that old styrofoam cup of noodles or panda express and want to experience some damn good food.</Text>< Pics>

Location is great as its visible driving by and the walk from El Camino is a few minutes. The orders are fast unless its busy, but they also offer many deals every day allowing you to try something new from a free drink to cheaper meals. Always something new to try here when you visit from time to time. The only downfall is the seating is small so at times in the afternoon you may not find a seat but it's not always pack so you may find a seat easy every now and then.<//text>

I order the katsu chicken which costs about $10. It is worth the price. The California rolls are delicious. The service is effective since reorganizing the shop. Limited seating but overall a great place and worth trying.< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>This place is my favorite place to eat in Torrance, California whenever I am near the El Camino College campus! I used to frequent the fast food places near by but the once I decided to venture out to expand my tastebuds I found this Japanese sushi gem! I would eat here like 2 times a week! My favorite meal to get is the Salmon Roll with 2 orders of spicy mayo on the side and their 2 piece musubi deal! OMG ITS SO GOOD WRITING THIS IS MAKING ME WANT TO GO BUY SOME TODAY!! Anyways, I will say this: This food is not for faint stomachs and you may get an upset stomach after eating this food! I dont know if that makes it authentic (lol) or if they need better food quality and/or hygiene back there but sometimes i do get an upset stomach when I  buy food from there (2 times). Others have to. So do be aware of that. But like I said the food is good if you like sushi!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

I like it alot. So so so good and usually tast fresh. If anyone is a skeptic or think sushi is all raw fish, tey the back salmon roll it is delicious or the salmon plate which has a nice portion size and worth every dollar.<//text>

The food is good. But I have problem with the pricing structure. Three times I paid same ($4.36) price for following sets of order.
Medium Miso Soup and side order of salad
Medium Miso Soup and side order of salad with ginger
Medium Miso soup.
Then I was told that smallest sized Ginger will be $2 extra.
So pricing wise they have no idea what they are doing.
That is the reason I took off 2 stars.</review>

< Review>
Locked myself out of my condo while losing my balance putting on shoes. My phone and keys were both in the condo.  A friendly neighbor allowed me the use of his phone to call my management company who unfortunately doesn't provide after hours service.  Despite several other companies claiming to be 24 hour service,  Best is the only one who actually answered their phone and said they could come. I didn't have to wait long but the lock was a difficult one. The tech didn't give up though and eventually got in.
It was the most expensive mistake I've ever made but I'm sincerely grateful for the fast, reliable service on a Friday night.
Would definitely use them again in the future. Although I'm truly hoping it's never necessary.<//Review>

<text>I’ll give an honest review. I used this specific company to unlock my car because it had 131 reviews and an overall score 4.8 star which isn’t the smartest thing to do. I called another company with 9 reviews and an overall 5 star review before I call this company but I went with this company because it had more reviews.

Now I’ll share my experience so you can decide on wether to use this service or not. So when I called the number, they did the standard, asked for my address and zip code but I wasn’t asked for my cars model type or year.  I wasn’t given a price on the spot but they told me they will call me back.

A few minute later I received a call from the guy who I assumed they decided to send out. The guy asked for my address and zip code again but I wasn’t asked for my cars model type or year again. He told me he will arrive in 15-20 minutes but he didn’t give me the cost before I asked him directly. Unfortunately, he didn’t give the exact cost but a price range of $75-$105. I should have clarified to him I wanted the exact cost  like I did with the previous company I called, that was a mistake on my part.

It didn’t take him long to arrive to my trailer and when he arrived, he took a look at my car and I asked him again what it will cost, this time he gave me an exact cost of $100. I wanted to cancel his service because the previous company I called gave me a price of $80. Since he arrived already, I decided to take my loss and learn from my mistakes. It took him about 1 minute to unlock my car so I paid him and that concluded the transaction.

The previous company I called gave me a price range of $70-$150 but I clarified I wanted the exact cost and he told me it was $80. When they give you a price range I suggest you ask for the exact cost. I also recommend you call your insurance company for a vehicle lockout or a towing company since it’s cheaper. I could have bought the tools to unlock my car on Amazon for $47 since my situation wasn’t an emergency but I let my inpatients get the best of me. If you’re not in an hurry,  I suggest  you think of your options and call the various automotive smith around to save some money.

Overall the price is reasonable if you’re in an emergency and need to get your car unlocked quickly. They do arrive quickly so again, it’s a reasonable price if you’re in a hurry.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1614881194602, 'text': 'Dr Yeetster - we tried to tell you a price over the phone, but you complained and said you wanted it for cheaper. We then gave you the discount you asked for and you started calling other companies to find the cheapest price and have us match it. We do not do "price matching" in our industry, and the reason we charge what we do is because we are fast, on-time, and can get people  into their cars within almost 10-15 minutes from anywhere in the area. We are sorry you had a negative experience and hope you\'ll reconsider if you ever need us in the future. -Best Locksmith California'}<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
They were called out to our new house by our home warranty company to re-key the locks. He was 45 min early, wasn't wearing a mask and had to be asked to put on one, looked at the locks and declared he could not re-key them because the original key was not available (you can, it's just more work), then demanded from my wife that she pay him cash on the spot. She refused then he insisted on a debit card. She didn't want our bank account drained by a scammer and refused. He said he wouldn't invoice, continued to intimidate her, and finally accepted a check before he would leave. Then he told the warranty company that he had changed the front lock, which we had just bought from the hardware store and installed ourselves. This is fraud. I'm not even sure if they are actually locksmiths as opposed to a shakedown scam.

-edit: So the owner says my account is not true but then doesn't address the fact that he made a false repair claim to the warranty company. How much more money do you get from that for doing nothing? You could have asked us if we had the keys before you came up and explained your terms and pricing ahead of time instead of making them up after the fact. Also, professionals invoice, they don't demand cash on the spot.<//Review>

<Text>I own the gallery in Carmel,the technician could not unlock A simple door,took him more then a hour to drill and cut and and eventually he had to drill a new lock for a new deadbolt because he mess the original mechanism up!

And the bill? Almost 600$

I would not recommend this locksmith technician to anyone that has a antique door so carmel by the sea you are advised to be carful before booking this locksmith.

I would recommend carmel lock and safe, the were just fully booked so I had to use best lock and key instead.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1589724396208, 'text': 'This is not right we never did this job it’s a mistake'}</response>< gmap_id>

I walked into this location a few weeks ago for the first time to get a Brazilian wax.  Taylor was so kind and was able to fit me in on the same day I walked in to ask a question...woohoo 🙌🏽!  The location was clean, bright and inviting.  Taylor and I chatted which was a great distraction from the wax job that by the way went really well!  Taylor is awesome!!</Text>

<text>I got a full leg wax by Mercedes today and she was PHENOMENAL! I've never had such a pain free wax in my life! Our conversation was so fun and inviting and we shared experiences on both being in the professional waxing business! I highly recommend LunchBox wax for their technique and wax and I recommend Mercedes just because she's amazing all around, quick and efficient!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

All the ladies do an amazing job with making the waxing experience pain free and calming. They are thorough with explanations on what they are going to wax and how they are going to do it to make sure you are okay with it. My eyebrows always look great thanks to this place. Such an amazing community! Highly recommend. I especially love how April and Taylor do my brows.</text>< Pictures>

Love love love this place!  I hadn’t waxed in 12 years and went in expecting pain and punishment for having waited so long. April was amazing!  She waxed my brows too and unlike other places that left me red for hours following- I left beautifully waxed and ready to roll!!<//text>

<Review>It was my first time getting a Brazilian and I was freaking out expecting to almost pass out, However April was amazing and made my experience fast and comfortable! It was not painful how I thought it would be. April was kind and  gave me tips and explained all I need to know for best results. Customer service was great! Cant complain and look forward to many more visits! Thank you April!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Every time I come to get waxed I’m amazed at how comfortable it is. The team here is so warm from the minute you walk in to when you walk out. Vanessa always does such an awesome thorough job and totally distracts me from what’s going on through great conversation. I can not recommend this place enough!<//Review>

April did a really great job. Awesome attention to detail, not a rush job like other franchised wax places. Would definitely recommend<//review>

<review>Really great experience so far!
I was greeted right after walking in and asked if I had to use the restroom or wanted water.
April was very kind, did an amazing job on my brows and booked to see you again at the end of the month!</review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x8085605d97410f45:0x17ddb6d6934933bf</GmapID></record>

My waxer, Roxanne, was AMAZING and clearly knew her craft! She was skilled, fast, thorough and I could tell she genuinely wanted my experience to be as positive and painless as possible! While it did hurt at times (it is waxing after all ;) she was with me 100% of the way and genuinely cared- her consideration made the experience all the more positive. She had me feeling relaxed and safe, and she had me fully laughing at the end in an experience I did not expect to be laughing in. It was fun :) I will be looking forward to coming back to Roxanne for all my waxing needs! Thank you Roxanne!!!</Review>

Roxanne was friendly, professional, and super efficient. She was also extremely accommodating and understanding that I had to bring my 2 month old baby with me to the appointment. My legs look beautiful and feel silky and soft. Will definitely book with her again!< /Review>

This was the first time I had a Brazilian wax and I was a little nervous. No need, it was handled professionally and the representative was friendly and did an excellent job. I left wondering what was i worried about?
Great experience and the start on many more to come- a breeze. Satisfied Customer< /Text>

Always professional and attentive to the client’s needs and they always aim to meet their satisfaction with services provided before the end of the appointment. I never feel pressured to obtain more services or to book another appointment - although you are offered the chance to book another appointment at check out. Also I never feel bad about requesting a touch up if I feel a spot was missed. My requests are always met with a friendly attitude. Their all around professionalism and trained staff is why I continue to return.</review>

This was my first experience with LunchboxWax and Stephanie help to make it a as good as "yanking out hair by the roots" can get! In addition, the receptionist helped create a relaxing atmosphere the moment I arrived... thank you.

It's been years since I had anything waxed so I had a well established crop to be harvested. I chose a back & shoulder wax and Stephanie was on time, experienced, very professional, and fun to chat with, which helped distract me from the task at hand.

Based on my first experience at LunchboxWax, you'll be in good hands whether it's your first appointment or fiftieth.</text>

I haven't had a bikini wax in probably 30 years and I remember it being quite painful.  This time it wasn't bad at all.  Better wax maybe?  Who knows but April did a great job and I'm going back for another treatment!</Text>

the first person to really shape my brows how I like was someone at the lunchbox wax in concord. I decided to try this one as it’s closer to home, and Stephanie did just as good as the other girl! I guess Lunchbox does some good training! I had an appointment for two types of services and called an hour ahead to cancel one of them, which they were happy to do. I even showed up 30 minutes early and they were able to move up my appointment for me, which was very nice. They have excellent customer service.< /Review>

<Text>From the minute I walked in I felt so welcomed. I didn’t have an appointment, yet they were still able to get  me in right away. Taylor was very sweet (makeup was gorgeous) and set up for me and made me feel comfortable. Whole process maybe took 20 minutes or even less. They use soft wax which I wasn’t used to but it was still a great experience. Very modern decor and great lighting. Owner is very sweet as well. Definitely would recommend Lunch Box to my friends. Thank you Taylor!<//Text>< GmapID>

Since she couldn’t be available today for a wax I decided to come to Lunch Box. I completely have no regrets because Mercedes at the Walnut Creek off of Ygancio was AMAZING!!! Like I said I’ve always been hesitant of these franchise places but that changed. I will definitely see Mercedes again because she made it so fun, relaxing and of course the outcome of my wax was fantastic.</review>< pictures>

First time at Lunchbox Wax in Walnut Creek and I was pleasantly surprised.  I had received a coupon as part of a move in packet and thought I would check it out.

Taylor was my technician and besides being excellent and clearly experienced, she was extremely affable.

I made another appointment without a moment of hesitation.<//review>

Tamara is the best. She’s super professional and consistent as far as quality of service. She’s also very easy to make conversation with and has never made me feel uncomfortable. As long as I’m living in the Bay Area I’ll keep going to LunchboxWax. Also, the Walnut Creek location is one of their newest and nicest in terms of cleanliness and amenities offered. Always a good experience going there.<//Review>

<Review>I have been several times to have my waxing done by Amber.  First, the place smells amazing and is very clean.  The customer service is top notch, accommodating and thorough.  The only thing to be aware of is that they use soft wax which I have grown to prefer.  I highly recommend this business.<//Review><Rating>5<//Rating><user_id>102059821536318704323< /user_id>< GmapID>

It was a really nice group of gals and they were all positive and a few of us told some silly jokes & shared a couple stories. I must say that every one was very professional  and I would highly recommend them. The gal who was teaching asked me if I would  to do my nose hairs and I said sure  and they didn’t heard it all and I’m so glad I did it !!< /Review>

Normally, the lady who does my eyebrows does a decent job. Today, they looked fine when I walked out. When I took a closer look in the mirror, she waxed off a very large portion in the front of my brow. It basically starts way past the point where I should. I am very disappointed.</text>

Lunchbox waxing is dependable, thorough, and customer-focused! I’ve enjoyed each visit, from the inviting entry to the service rooms, which are always clean and designed with attention to detail (comfortable beds, sinks, mirror, sitting ottoman, and lighting that is both comfortable to be in while also bright enough to ensure a thorough wax), to the quality of the waxing. This is my new wax spot!</Text>

<text>I am at Lunchbox The Orcahrds In  Walnut Creek California for the first time.
Mercedes waxologist was so friendly, informative and professional.
And Jessica was fast, kind and excellent with my body wax: Brazilian, full arms and lower half leg.
Mercedes and Hessica  explained your 12 months of Sooth Unlimited Brazilian, which I bought.
I read an article about your successful company and growth.
How Debi Lane, founder and CEO who  found Nicky Lecher to lead the company.
I am now your new and loyal customer.
Thank you lunchbox.</text></record>

Whatever you do make sure to request Darcy (I’m sure they’re all great at Lunchbox)! She knows exactly how to make you feel comfortable, calm and when necessary distracted :). Plus she is very skilled, professional and friendly. Lunchbox is a super clean and organized establishment. The store has a homey, modern and appropriately clinical feel. I’m sold!< /text>

< Review>
Taylor is an excellent waxologist. It’s great that she’s personable and friendly, but I was most impressed with her skill and knowledge; she answered all my questions and gave me some great tips.  This was the first time I tried Lunchbox Wax and I am very pleased with the results. I’ll be back.<//Review>

First time ever getting a wax and I must say that the experience was beyond amazing. My waxogist Mercedes made me feel very comfortable and she talked me through each and every step. I will be continuing on this new journey of waxing .<//Review>

I saw this place driving by and stopped to see if they take walk ins! (Crazy of me to do on a Friday but still!) I waited about 5-10 minutes and was seen for a brow and lip wax! Can’t say enough good things about this place starting with how CLEAN the place was. I’m huge on cleanliness in spas and salons and you can tell they value appearance! The girls were all super sweet and my waxer was adorable. She did exactly what I asked for my brows! Most places tend to take off too much but she left them exactly as I pictured “bushy but polished!” Thanks ladies! Can’t wait to come back!</Text>

Sophie made me feel so very comfortable in a possibly uncomfrotable situation. It was my first time getting waxed and I was slightly nervous/ terrified for the pain I always hear about, but she did amazing and I am no longer afraid! The facility is beautiful, clean, and welcoming. The staff are all positive and inviting. I was and am extremely impressed.< /Review>

I love this place! It’s easy to set up appointments and all the employees are professional and friendly. The environment is open and clean. My only complaint is that I got a bikini wax and developed a large, painful cyst that has yet to go away (it’s been 3 months)! This is most likely due to not being waxed in that region of my body. Otherwise a great place for all your waxing needs.<//review>

After moving from Colorado to California, I was in need of a new place! I tried several before stumbling in to Lunchboxwax and I have to say I am so happy here! Tamara is very helpful and is truly patient with me and my lack of mobility at times. I appreciate being able to book online as well as having the days/times available that I need with my chaotic schedule.</Text>

I love LunchboxWax and love my waxing girl Michaela! My brows are always on point and everyone who works there is always fun, sociable and incredibly nice. Never using another company (or waxer) again! They’ve found a lifelong customer for sure :-)

It can be tough to find a good waxing place, but these ladies are wonderful. They make it as painless as possible and will chat with you while they're waxing which is a welcome distrsction.</Text>

Taylor is absolutely fabulous when it comes to eyebrows, lip, legs and Brazilian! I followed her here when she left Benefit Brows in Macy’s bcuz I don’t trust anyone wit me and my daughter’s eyebrows!!!! She knows how to keep it natural looking without taking too much off (she keeps the shape all the time).
She makes you feel soo comfortable while getting waxed...Taylor did my Brazilian (as she only did eyebrows & lips at Benefit Brows) and it actually didn’t hurt...I use to get a Brazilian else where and I use to always flinch but wit her I was actually falling alseep! LOL! That’s how gently she is....I would recommend her for any wax job!!!!< /review>
