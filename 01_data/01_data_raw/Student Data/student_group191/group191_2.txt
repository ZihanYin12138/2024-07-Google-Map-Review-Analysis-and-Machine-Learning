This place is great, prices are good, customer service is great and they always have items in their stock all the time. This is the only place I was able to find the plastic cover and not the glass one that falls for the galaxy note 10+ and galaxy s10e. Will deffinetky comeback for all my cellphone needs.<//review>

I shattered my phone screen and needed an immediate repair. I message Diego Wireless - Distributor & Wholesaler of Cell Phone Accessories and heard back within 5 minutes. They were able to fix my phone immediately and it took about 20 minutes. The screen is flawless and phone seems to be working great (and is extra clean!) I would definitely come back here for any of my future iPhone repairs.</Text>

The replacement battery they installed in my phone 10 days ago was defective.  When I brought the phone back to them today, they replaced it again without a hassle, even though they could have given me trouble over having misplaced my receipt.</Text>

Some of my problems returned after picking up my device, post-repairs -- but he was very responsive in fixing them (and made it clear that he'd certainly honor his pretty generous warranty if that wasn't possible). It's been nine months after that, and the phone is still working well.< /text>< pics>

Straightforward, fast, relatively cheap and high quality I phone repair center.  The owner John got me fixed up and replaced the front and back glass on my iPhone 8 and in addition, replaced the microphone for 50 bucks cheaper than I was quoted at the place next door upstairs from the Indian restaurant.  I really despise having an I phone but since I smashed it, a repair was mandatory.</Text>

Honest hardworking young guys, good place that fixed my iPhone charging power hub.  This place is located in the mall. Apple store could not fix it and prefer that I get a new cell phone.  Diego Wireless guy told me the previous customer had the exact same problem.  Indeed Apple products, as expensive as they are, they are quite a rip off.<//review>

Wonderful store, first off I called and they told me they had the product I was looking for for 20$, Go in and ask and it's only 10$, amazing. There were a few people in the shop and I had to wait a moment, Tony took the time to acknowledge that and told me he would help me as soon as possible, a small gesture but one that let me know I was in a shop dedicated to good service.<//Review>

We can go ahead and give you an exchange, as long as it's a manufacture defect. You just need to show proof of payment, such as a bank statement with the transaction on it or a physical receipt from our second location. If you have any questions, please feel free to give us a call."}< /response>< gmapID>

< Review>
Great food and good, fast service!  My only complaint is that they include imitation crab as one of their seafood varieties for many of the seafood dishes.  I did not ask if it could be substituted but I recommend doing so if it is an option.  Sushi favorites menu was amazing.  I will be back.<//Review>

Ordered the teriyaki chicken Bento box. The chicken wasn't pre-seasoned so it tastes bland and only has the flavor of the sauce.  Dragon roll was ok, Yesenia roll was great but the miso soup was awful! Totally lacked any flavor. This was the 2nd visit and the taste is not the same! I won't try again though.< /text>

Yummy sushi with great flavor. The new roll is one of our favorite with a seared scallop on top. If your interested in keeping your carbs down or on a diabetic diet, try  the Lo Carb roll (made with cucumber and seaweed). Great place for lunch/dinner & take out.< /review>

So sorry, but this place was not that great!
The teriyaki was flavorless at best.
My wife had the jalapeño and the Mexicali roll, I ordered the Mexicali (I was born there) and the Philadelphia rolls. The Mexicali roll was the winner.
I’m sorry to say that this place does not come close to Sushi Deli. I asked for lemon, and was told it would be .50 extra!! I should have known to walk out of this place as soon as I saw they do not give refills! Service was good, we got there as they opened, the decor is cool, and the restrooms are clean. I give them 3 stars.</text>

Tomodachi was lit. Went with some co workers after a long day and had a great time. Lots of food, sake and  beer.. service was nice and it was really affordable compared to most sushi we've been to. Good stuff!< /Review>

<Text>The food here it’s average. I didn’t like the teriyaki chicken bowl. They do the Teriyaki different here; it’s not grilled and it doesn’t taste like teriyaki. I chose the dare devil roll and the crunchy jalapeño roll and they were good.<//Text><user>103637402060231975811< /user>< gmap_id>

<rate>1<//rate><review>Nov 21-18 food poisoning. My wife is in terrible pain throwing up hunched over the throne. The rolls we had today where caterpillar and spicy eel. The rolls did not have the proper sauce when coming to the table and seemed to be done haphazardly. I'm feeling OK for now, but i had one of her pieces. We had been there before only to love it. Now we will never be back. Nice service.

This is my opinion and might not be your experience at this establishment. Most food born illness comes from a cross contamination.<//review>< resp>

Consistently tasty sushi at a great price.  The wait staff is friendly and helpful.  Their hours are a little odd so make sure they're open before you make the drive.  We've arrived several times to a closed door.  Also, they stop seating people and taking orders well before closing time, so don't try to beat the clock.  But I do recommend them if you're in the mood for affordable Japanese in a cozy, no-frills kind of atmosphere.<//Text>

<review>Food was decent as we the prices. The fish didn't seem very fresh, more freshly frozen. The service was okay. Nothing really terrible or remarkable about this place.

<text>Tomodachi sushi is a fantastic place to go, sit down, and throw back a couple quality rolls and drinks! Generally speaking I prefer uncooked rolls, however at Tomodachi they have several cooked rolls, like the Crunchy Jalapeño roll, or the New Roll which are both so delicious I get them almost every time! Definitely a place to experience for yourself.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80d94ed7360052e3:0x699b9413579e6919<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Holy Heaven this place was great! I come from Washington state where we have some of the best sushi. Had only room for two rolls but they were fantastic!

Pros:The PJ roll was incredible, good creamy texture from the cream cheese, very decent flavor. My most favorite of the two: The Banana roll: Shrimp Tempura, cream cheese rolled topped with tempura banana and eel sauce (Though I recommend having the sauce on the side like I did, it was good but depending on your taste it may or may not go well with the banana.) Overall impressed with the service, very quick response and friendly!

The dessert I had was YUMMY, fried banana ice cream. Though I recommend staying off the whipped cream. The portion however was decent for two people.

Cons: Careful if you like sucking down coke or iced tea, no free refills, .95/glass, so savor it.

Stars: 4.5 out of 5

Highly recommend this place for those who love sushi.< /Review>

Love the banana roll and the Yesenia roll. It is a nice hidden place, wasn't too busy, and service was quick. (Almost too quick! Felt a little rushed.)

We went here for a date night, and it wasn't bad. My boyfriend ordered a coke, and wish they woulda told us refills weren't free, and were $1.99. He would have gotten water too.

We had a good meal, actually couldn't finish all we got and it was really good.

Set up is a little weird, we were at a booth where there seemed to be a hidden playpen for kids right next to us. A little strange, but cool if you are looking for a corner to hide the kids while you eat.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80d94ed7360052e3:0x699b9413579e6919<//Gmap_id></record>

Yummmmmmyyyy!! I like the food! I was very disappointed in the service! It was a busy night but they should hire more people to help with tables. They need some work with customer service! The place is pricey i expect to get high end serive.< /review>

On April 14, I invited to of my friends to eat at this place.  The manager on duty kicked us out of the restaurant. According to him we went over the two hours time limit allowed in the restaurant. He told us that we needed to leave because they needed the table, I was very confused at this moment because I looked around and they had several tables empty. Before he kicked us out, he came to our table and removed all of our glasses without even asking us if we were done. He didn't ask us if we needed to order anything else, or if we would like dessert, neither  he didn't show any good customer service manners at all. The second time he approached our table, he simply told us to leave. This was my 4th time eating and inviting friends over to this place. I told my friends that I love the food, the services and the prices. It's  very unfortunate that I won't be going to this restaurant anymore. It was very rude and embarrassing to get kicked out.<//Review>

Even though they say they close at 9pm be prepared cause they may be closing early came about 8:30 and they already had the closed sign up. The bar was cleaned up and they were finishing cleaning the dining area. If you dine late you may feel pressured to hurry up and leave so they could close.</Review>

<Review>Went from 5 stars to 3 over the years. A place with good atomosphere and food. Now it's busy, customer service isnt there anymore, food getting horrible and the price went up. It's worth coming for maybe one time visit and that's about it. My family and I comes here often, but i think our time here is about the end, but I wish you the best of luck Todmodachi.</Review><resp>None< /resp><Date>1532049793231<//Date><name>Duncan Meadows</name>< rating>

Ebi had very small shrimp, sake tasted fine but it was oddly cut - never experienced it like this before, and it wasn't inexpensive...  2.5, 3 starts at best.  I was expecting better based on the reviews, I guess that's why I'm only giving it 2 stars.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>The staff are very attentive and polite, and the rolls are outstanding. Generally I am not a fan of cooked rolls but every one that I have tried here is on another level! Definitely get the crunchy jalepeño roll, the Pamie's roll or the New roll of you want to try a tasty bit of cooked amazingness!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

FIRST TIME AT THIS RESTAURANT

Atmosphere was good.  The unsweetened ice tea had no tea (colored water and the lemon did not help).  Could not taste the differences in the rolls that was ordered due to no flavor/taste.  I don’t even do wasabi, but I had to tonight in order to eat my food.  The chicken teriyaki did not even taste like chicken teriyaki and the chicken katsu was more katsu than chicken.  Oh!!! there is no refills on drinks and silverware was not clean.

WE WILL NOT BE RETURNING.  WE WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED.< /text>

Do not come here the last couple hours their open, they won t make your sushi because they close the kitchen a half hour before the restaurant closes. Service was really slow and the soup and sushi came to the table at the same time. Sushi was ok, but not the best.<//Text>

<Rating>2</Rating><Review>Eh. Lived here for a year. Managers and staff are awesome. (Especially John and Sarah.) Nothing wrong there. The problem is with the building itself and neighbors. Extremely loud and rude neighbors. Floors are thin, meaning you will constantly hear footsteps above you. Lots of young kids, but of course they aren't allowed to tell you that because they know it will make you second guess. Parking is a very long walk from apartments (depending on where you live) it gets old very fast. It feels like living in a college dorm.</Review></record>

<text>I am writing this review as I am walking away from the property. What a god awful experience!

Let me preface this by saying that I was the first appointment of the day at 9 AM.

I made my way to the leasing office and it was completely closed due to COVID so there was no where for me to sit. The first woman that arrives is not friendly or welcoming what so ever. The second woman that arrives is welcoming, even though, she ended up being a few minutes late starting the tour.

We start walking towards the “tour” and she tells me that it is a self guided tour. Then I start asking her questions about the tenant demographics, inquiring if they have mainly college students and she says we are close to Palomar College. I then make it known that I want to know is a high percentage of the tenants are college students so I have the knowledge of who I will be around. She then says and reiterates when I try to pry a bit more that due to the Fair Housing Policy Act she can not give out that information. That act has to do with discrimination so I don’t see why you can’t disclose that type of information when CSUSM is in close proximity so it’s almost a given that you’re going to have a higher percentage of college students.

That is not even my biggest gripe! She tells me that the vacant apartment I will be viewing is on floor number 2 and it is on my left. She does not provide me an apartment number. I reiterate and ask again if I will be doing the rest of the tour by myself and will I be able to see the amenities. She proceeds to say yes I just can’t accompany you any longer. I was not told where any of the amenities were located either was, all I I was handed was a gift bag and wasn’t even told what was in it.

Once I get off the elevator, I go to the left which is which way she told me to go and I am unable to open any doors. So all in all, I left here without seeing any units or any amenities. I also left with a sour taste in my mouth because I was shown no hospitality or given thorough enough directions to navigate the tour on my own.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80db8ab2f6285e5f:0xae684238b5fb50e2</Gmap_id>< response>
{'time': 1619194019466, 'text': "Hi Amanda, we're sorry to hear you had a negative experience at our community. Block C is temporarily closed on Sunday’s due to short staffing, so hadn't received notice of your Monday 9am tour until you arrived just before the office opened at 9am. Due to Fair Housing laws, we are indeed unable to disclose information about the demographic of our other residents. Block C is committed to upholding COVID restrictions and policies, and therefore our amenity spaces are unfortunately still closed, although the spaces are behind glass windows if you would like to view the area. Again, we're saddened to hear your tour was less than an ideal experience. Please reach out to the community manager directly if you have any further questions."}</response>

Been living here for a few months. It was nice until people moved above me. If you enjoy listening to footsteps above you all day this is the place I guess.< /Text>

I have lived at block c since 2018! I have never had a problem with the apartment or staff! I love working with Sara Matic! She is always so happy and always helping my roommates and I out!

<Review>Update after living here a little over year now:
Liked this property for its location until I lost my patience over all the bad experiences with this management.

The staff here is so unreasonable, not at all helpful, rude and always change their words around certain rules and policies without any standard documentation. They only do verbal communication and change their words to get things done in their favour. Rips money off of you.

Not at all customer or resident friendly. Do yourself a favour and not fall for the look of this community.

Nothings good when the management is worse.

- Very very poor management.
- 0% customer friendly.

I wouldn't recommend this community to anyone.< /Review><Rate>1< /Rate><user_name>Sukanya Sukhavasi< /user_name>< Resp>

<Review>I have loved my time living at Block C.  Sara made moving in from out of state a breeze, and was super helpful and responsive throughout my lease. John is the best as well!  The amenities are great (dog was station!), and I loved my loft - a very thoughtful and functional layout. I would definitely recommend Block C.< /Review>< gmapID>

I’ve been here for 3 months now and I gotta say it’s been great so far, the units are well built ( can’t hear any neighbors), the building is Fairly quiet and clean.
Sara Matic was the person Who organized the tour for me and was so great and professional, I can say for sure that she helped in the decision of moving in.
Thanks again for the smooth move in.< /text>

We've had very mixed feelings about this property and the service received here. The property itself is lovely and lively, and in non-COVID times, the leasing/management offices look to find fun and engaging ways to build community with the residents. The units are spacious and very nice.
However, the service here has been super mixed. We had a very good experience with the previous manager, John, and continue to receive excellent communication and assistance over the course of our time here from Sara. Outside of that, we've been having increasingly rude, aggressive and condescending responses from the new staff members, management and maintenance. The last couple of weeks have left us looking at options to pull out of our lease because of how unpleasant and stressful every interaction has been.
So definitely a toss up - lovely facilities, events and amenities (especially outside of Covid times), but a serious mixed bag when it comes to staff and communication.</text>

<review>I've only been living at Block C for a few months, and although the transition wasn't the easiest due to a problematic housemate, there was always 1 person who was quick to answer my numerous emails and was very helpful with whatever I needed, and that is Sara. From Day 1, well, Day 0 before I even moved in, Sara was on top of emails, applications, fees, etc, and since living here, she has always been so entirely helpful to whatever it is that i've needed and has helped me, and my housemates, through the difficult housemate issue. All in all, i'd have to give Sara 5 stars for her tremendous help.</review>< Pics>

< Review>
We Love BLOCk C!! The admin provides instant help if u have a question or have a issue at your place. Super modern decor and clean/safe community with a mix of single, married, students, fur friends, and small families.

I am Super grateful for Sara that introduced us to BLOCK C and assisted us from moving from clear from idaho to Cali. Super smooth transition, I can’t thank her enough!! Sara always has a big smile on her face, she actually CARES about who lives here. If you’re looking to find a place to live, she will help you out and go way out of her way.

Felipe went way out of his way in maintenance at 10pm to ensure our house was okay when we had a issue. We totally woke him up (didn’t mean to)- but since he responded so fast.. ran over to our place half asleep ready
To hep us. So sweet... he got right on it.

This is such a fun social place to live- instant friends and super fur friendly community!
Thank you BLOCK C! We love all the amenities.
Especially the DOG WASHING STATION! I also LOVE living right by the college with fun energy,
Good walking paths around for dog hikes/walks.  Super great access to the highway and good food. Loving our Cali life thanks to Sara and Block C! Thank you 🙏</Review>

My room flooded three times within two months, and my roommates glass shower door fell off the hinges (due to incorrect placement from the manufacturer, this is confirmed by the block c maintenance staff) and the property managers did nothing for my roommate and I. I was displaced from my apartment due to the flooding for two and a half months while they brought huge industrial fans in to “fix” the mess. The office staff were extremely rude and unhelpful during this time. I cannot believe they treated their customers who pay $2500 a month for rent like this. I am highly disappointed.<//review>< Pictures>

I moved into block C a few weeks ago. I can honestly say its been really great living here. The cooking classes are super fun, i got to meet the other residents.
As soon as came to Block C to check out their apartment, the leasing office were super friendly (Sarah Matic) i felt welcoming since day 1. Most importantly, all my questions were answered about the apartment, there were no hidden fees. The workers in the office do a great job of making sure everything is perfect and ready. And Anytime i had an issue, it was resolved in the same day😊💕< /Review>

< Review>
We went today for a tour of Block C today after scheduling an appointment online. Our appointment was for 3pm and we were there a few minutes before 3pm. At about 3:25pm the person who would give us a tour finally showed up, she was with another group of potential renters so we gave her a few minutes. After 10 minutes they were discussing how to clean floors and patch walls? Weird being that now there were three groups waiting on her. She never came out and apologized for being a little behind or even acknowledged that the rest of us waiting even existed. We were still waiting 3:45pm and she was still conversing small talk with the same group in her office, the door was open so everyone could hear, so I politely interrupted and said we were her 3'o'clock and we would be leaving. She again didn't act apologetic or say she was sorry for the delay or anything, just said BYE! It looked like a nice place so it's sad that because of a bad employee they lost a renter.< /Review>

<user>100973192181322712099< /user><Text>My husband and I moved in here three months ago, and things have been nothing short of excellent so far. The amenities, cleanliness, and organization of this complex are all top-notch, but the main factor for Block C's success has been its leasing office team.

Jessica gave us our first tour of the place in March, and actually REMEMBERED us nine months later when we were finally ready to apply and move in! She is a gem. She is so knowledgable and patient, made us feel very recognized and welcomed, and facilitated a smooth move-in transition. Not many leasing companies seem to get this right - but Block C does: attention to detail and genuine care make ALL the difference to a resident! And we definitely felt that with Jessica.

More recently, many of our interactions have been with Sara, who has been nothing short of an angel. She is professional, she is knowledgable, and always willing to help. After we were approved, she helped us on move-in day and made sure we got everything we needed. But her care did NOT stop after that first day - she answered questions and coordinated repairs for weeks after that! She is so quick and responsive each and every time we correspond with her via email. She has helped us with storing our packages when we are out of town, accepted and coordinated larger deliveries for us, and paid rapt attention each time we had a maintenance issue. Each time there has been a maintenance request, she's made sure not only that it simply gets done, but also that it gets done to our satisfaction, and she doesn't just promise that it will and forget - she actually follows up and sees to it herself. You have no idea how much peace of mind that lends a resident, and I am thankful for it every day! Both Sara and Jessica go above and beyond by not only getting things done, but being SO cheerful and prompt with everything they do, and I marvel at their patience and energy!

We strongly believe that the best decision Block C's administration ever made was hiring Jessica and Sara. It takes great people to run a great office, and they have been amazing and deserve all the praise (and all the bonuses!) in the world. I know John has been a big part of this as well - he takes care and genuine interest in the operations of the entire community (which I bet is no easy job!) and is very attentive to our needs and our maintenance requests as well. The whole staff has an amazing attitude of service, pride in ownership + stewardship, and attention to detail, and I can tell he leads by example.

And it is not just the staff's kindness that makes this place so great - it is  genuinely a good place to live. The organization of the complex as a whole that makes me proud to live here. FOBs instead of keys? Genius. A remote door unlocking system for main entrances? Seamless (Why has the housing industry not applied this broadly yet??). A parcel pending package delivery system? What a life-saver. A mixed parking system? Best solution to the parking problem I've ever seen. Everything about Block C makes SENSE and is beautifully executed for the resident's ease and comfort. It truly is the future of the leasing experience. And on top of that, the security team and the maintenance team are effective and responsive. What more could you ask for?

As a young millennial, I've lived in my share of apartment complexes in and around southern California. At Block C, one of the main differences is that the whole staff makes us feel not like a burden (which is how I'm used to being treated by rental offices) but instead like appreciated members of their home and family! The complex itself is well-kept and well organized, and I couldn't be prouder to live here. Thank you!</Text>< Response>

<review>The staff and accommodations at Block C are incredible and go beyond making this another apartment complex; it feels like a neighborhood. Being adjacent to Urge Common House doesn't hurt either. The staff knows me by name and still doesn't mind when I regularly grab coffee from their office on my way to my room from the pristine gym. It's safe, secure, and though there's a good bit of construction next door, quiet.

I can bring my kids to play ping pong and swim, or just sit on the balcony and water plants. My favorite thing is to come back inside to air conditioning though.

The amenities are unmatched. Take a look and consider how much you'd save not having to go to a restaurant or bar to take advantage of air conditioning, not having to wash dishes by hand, not having to wait at a laundromat. What price would you put on that flexibility and freedom? I know my answer, so I went with Block C.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I’m absolutely disgusted with the treatment my family has received by staff at this complex. I believe they’ve lived here for about two years now and in recent months the newer staff has been disrespectful, petty, sometimes aggressive, and seemingly trying to bully them.

Just within the last few months:

One security man has intentionally pushed his way past my 10 year old sister which caused her to fall into one of the large pointy succulent plants. When confront by my mom and I he said it was because he asked her to move twice and she didn’t listen (she was sick and had an earache that day so she might’ve not heard him). His response reeked of cocky over-compensation of his insecurities to push a 10 year old because she didn’t listen to him (he had more than enough room to walk around her without shoving her)

The woman at the front keeps signing for, yet returning their amazon packages for various (and absurd) reasons, Amazon has even noticed the woman is doing it intentionally.

My brother is special needs and one day there was a carpet cleaning van parked at the entrance to the ramp, my brother could not access his home, the apartment staff had given the van permission to park in the handicap access. When confronted, my brother and his nurse were told to use the apartment lift. It malfunctioned and they were stuck in the lift for about 10 minutes before the maintenance staff were able to fix it. When my fam spoke to the managers about how inconvenient, illegal, and frustrating the whole experience was, they were overly defensive and denied that any of that could have been true, I feel like a simple apology could’ve sufficed but instead the man argued relentlessly about it.

I’m sure there is more than what I’ve seen and heard but I figured I’d throw out a warning to anyone looking into this place on here before writing higher up directly. These apartments are very nice, I love all the amenities when I visit, but the RUDE staff, parking, constant construction, the visibly dirty jacuzzi are horrible. This place would be great if some of the staff weren’t unnecessarily rude and trying to make life harder for the residents living here.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Walked in and asked if my husband and I could take a tour. The leasing agent with long brown hair looked us up and down and said “sorry nope” with no reason as to why. We asked for floorplans and she seemed very annoyed that we even asked. Not to mention the unprofessional attire of ripped jeans and a tee shirt. This was the worst experience I’ve ever had. The leasing staff is unbelievably rude.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>lived at Block C far about two months now and  all I can say is wow! From the leasing office to the maintenance crew Block C's staff is full of genuinely nice people who love to help with any issue or need you are experiencing. Just went to their first event which was a "taco Tuesday" and it was very fun! We played all kinds of games and were given tons of prizes including a raffle where multiple people won gift cards to various places. Really looking forward to the Super Bowl event next Sunday!!< /Review><Rating>5</Rating>< Time>

<Text>I just put my holding deposit on an apartment here and cannot wait to move in! The location is perfect; everything you could possibly need is within a few miles, plus it's right off of the 78. The apartments themselves are really impressive. The apts have a modern minimalistic look with really unique touches. You can tell they really took a lot of time and thought into every detail! What really sold me was that there is a dog wash station (BIG PLUS), an AWESOME 24-hour gym, w/d in unit, and huge windows with great lighting! I'm also pretty excited about Urge opening up right next to the apartments (not to mention saving on my Uber expenses)!

The ladies in the leasing office are very helpful and attentive. They really took the time to help me select the perfect apartment for my needs. I highly recommend checking it out! I'll update you guys once I move-in and settle in.<//Text><user_id>100813673810216043767< /user_id><Date>1486181917045< /Date><rate>5< /rate><username>Eddie Abarca< /username>< gmap_id>

Would never recommend this place, you can get less expensive with more square footage and better landscaping in a less drunken area. They kept all but $200 of my $900ish deposit even though i left the place in PRISTINE condition, filled in all pin holes with spackle and clorox wiped every surface.... Dont get trapped here in a lease.< /Text>< pictures>

Went to visit block c on north city drive in San Marcos and was very pleased with what they have to offer! First of all, the architecture is beautiful with a classy modern feel on not only the exterior but inside the kitchen and bathrooms as well. The pool area is beautiful equipped with bbq's and flatscreen tvs. The two story gym is completely up to date with brand new equipment and more tvs!! Lastly and most important, they are DOG FRIENDLY!! Can't wait til I am moved in!!<//review>

So disappointing after really looking forward to trying this place.

The setting in the patio is really lovely. So was the special tomato salad.

The food however was really underwhelming. The clam linguine was so salty, it was inedible.  Luckily my partner does not mind super food.

The duck was well cooked but the pappardelle was not. It was either dry or overcooked. The rigatoni was the most successful dish, though also on the salty side but at least still tasty.

The two stars are basically for the tomato salad and the chocolate oblivion cake. Two of of the five dishes that are worth it.

On the upside: dog and stroller friendly.<//text>

<Review>I have to be honest though that I was expecting a little bit more from the food. Specifically in the pizza, I was looking for really soft and fresh dough.  The pizzas really did look delicious. But the pizza that I had which was the vegan pizza was a little bit too chewy for my taste. It took me several really hard chews to get it digestible. I was also looking forward to the endive and red beet salad, but it was pretty ok tasting, but not mind-blowing. I felt that perhaps the food was being made in a bit of a rush and the presentation could also have been improved.<//Review><Response>None<//Response>< name>

It took over an hour for some people in our group to get their food while others arriving after us were served.  Also the food was not as described on the menu.  $12 for 2 plain pancakes seems pretty ridiculous & we were given the wrong food multiple times.<//review>< user_id>

<Text>Had a wonderful dinner at Sociale last week. We ordered the following appetizers (all 5*)- burrata, soup, fig salad, and fried olives. Olives were a little too salty for my liking but others in my party enjoyed them. Main course- artichoke ravioli, pici bolognese, rigatoni, and pappardelle with braised duck. While all of them were delicious, braised duck pasta was the best!
Their beautiful patio coupled with top notch service was a treat. They are also taking required precautions during this pandemic.<//Text>< Pics>

Always professional and courteous. Their Som, Josh, has a great taste for wine. Knowledgeable without pretense. Sebastian is a wonderful attendant to  back these two. A real joy to sit outside when the weather is good. Highly recommended. This apple cider is a must. Hope you enjoy them as much as I do.< /Text><date>1529471694475<//date>< GmapID>

<Review>First in for most, this is one of the best restaurants in San Francisco. As they shifted to take out, they maintained their quality. This was not easy to do. Their online ordering system is easy and efficient, and their curbside delivery is pleasant and easy and safe. All in all, a great experience at Sociale because of their great food.  Do not miss!<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>Visited this restaurant because acquaintance (a regular) highly recommended it. 3 1/2 stars to be exact. Truly feels that this restaurant is over-rated, based on the taste of the dishes.

Staff was no doubt courteous and professional; atmosphere wasn't bad. Presentation of the dishes looked good. The Fried Olives was interesting. The Wagyu Braised Short Rib was excellent. But the other dishes, like the fish and pork, fell short of expectations. Also, wait time for the food was a bit too long.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPd005PePg_K-wJ3at_j3-BrYRzY3mdV-Va4Yfr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7gWb6s6wMX298z0URHtJPAhH47J7UpzsHR5xu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXlBeMeWV-e6lO6MBYj_KxW3bdLKMHoV5mS2ce=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSDKR3ZDpSaGxJL5eWc8TpwgNMN07Wy87_gfka=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

I just recently discovered Sociale and had the pleasure of having an 'al fresco' lunch this past weekend. Not only the food was SUPERB and authentic, but also our server Steve was exceptional and made us feel right at home (grazie mille!) We enjoyed the signature dish (duck pappardelle), rigatoni all'amatriciana, chocolate cake with EVO (so yummy) and a bottle fo Ferrari Brut bubbles from Trento, Italy. Everything was absolutely excellent! As an Italian expat in SF, I can most definitely recommended Sociale and can't wait to be back.</Review>

<text>I love this restaurant and have been turning friends and family on to it for years! Every time they take away my duck, they soon bring it back! The fried olives are another old favorite which are the only olives I’ll eat!! But they have a lot of new delicious starters and mains and their wine list is always brilliant! Very nice place in a secluded courtyard with outdoor dining as well as comfortable seating inside, but true to SF, not pretentious! I will always come back!< /text><Resp>None< /Resp>< user_id>

We've been to Sociale several times on Sacramento and have always loved their food and atmosphere, but we recently ordered the Curb Side pickup service and wow! What a great meal. Our family has been cooped up for a week now thanks to you know what and we needed a great meal to take our minds off of the world. I had the Pappardelle with Braised Duck and it was fantastic. I love the braised duck in this dish. The rest of the family went with the Pici Bolognese and were very happy with their decision. There was nothing left. Highly recommended.< /Review>

Great food, amazing service.   It's tucked away off Sacramento Street.   Every time we go we feel like we're on vacation outside of SF.</Review>

<Text>Came here for our anniversary and had an amazing time. The walkway entrance was beautiful. Got a table outside. Service was really good. The somolier made a great suggestion for wine based off our preferences. Server was incredibly friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back< /Text></record>

<Review>We have recently moved to the neighborhood and decided to go check out Sociale a few days ago. The ambiance is very charming and romantic, and I love it that the restaurant doesn't face the street. The area is nice and quiet. I have tons of food allergies and it's very challenging for me to eat at an Italian restaurant, considering that I am allergic to dairy, gluten, garlic and onions. We told the waitress about my allergies once we sat down and she couldn't be any more accommodating. She spoke with the chef and he/she put a seafood pasta dish together without all the allergens and it was absolutely DELICIOUS!! How can you make Italian food taste good without garlic I don't know lol. I hadn't had a pasta dish in years and it absolutely made my day. I can't tell how much I appreciate the kindness and the amazing service. We are definitely coming back. It's always great to find those neighborhood gems. :)</Review>< pics>

Sociale has a  European flair with locally sourced artisan foods, homemade pasta and wines.  Great for lunch or dinner.  I love finding the hidden gems - the experience that makes you feel transported.  Sociale on Sacramento St is one of those places. It's a treasure for both visitors and locals alike.  You'll see the hand painted painted sign with menu on the sidewalk. Stroll down the  cobblestone pathway to this beautiful little bistro.< /text>

<text>Visited from Victoria, BC with our 18-month old recently, clearly not geared towards children but they were very accommodating and welcomed us nonetheless!  The food was absolutely incredible, our best meal in SF and quite possibly a top 5 of anywhere we've ever eaten.  Incredible and recommended!< /text>< Time>

My husband and I went to Sociale on a Friday night to celebrate our anniversary. We made reservations for 6pm, and we arrived about ten minutes early. We were immediately seated and offered water. We chose a half bottle of red (a very good Brunello) to have with dinner and let our server, Molly, know that one of us was a vegetarian. Molly was terrific throughout the entire meal, even wishing us a happy anniversary (which I had put on the reservation but neither of us had mentioned upon arrival). When I asked her preference between two entrées, she didn't hesitate to offer her opinion, which was really nice in contrast to places where you wonder if the people working there have ever sampled the menu. We enjoyed small but very yummy bread rolls while we waited for dinner.

We had a stone fruit and kale salad to start, followed by the wagu beef (for my husband) and the corn tortellini (for me) and polenta fries (to share). Everything was cooked very well and tasted delicious, and the portions were perfect.

For dessert, we enjoyed the orange flan and a vanilla milkshake with a fried dough pastry. Both were just as tasty as everything else we had shared and a perfect end to our meal. Dinner for the two of us, including a shared appetizer, two entrees, a shared side, two desserts, and a half bottle of wine came to about $180, which was very reasonable considering the terrific service and the delicious food. We'll definitely return!<//Review>

Had only one issue here, the restroom. Very odd location and set up. The food is fantastic and the place is tight but cozy. Price is moderate. Add some salt on the polenta fries and your set. Really a nice little spot.</review>

<Text>Very fun atmosphere with plenty of outdoor seating that is covered and heated. Seems like it would be great in the summer. The food is awesome and the service is on point. In my opinion the best things on the menu are the starters, especially the crudo. Things get busy so be sure to make reservations a day or two in advance.</Text><Time>1454201437243</Time></record>

Northern Italian cuisine is a personal sweet spot, and this is the best I've tried in many years.  I had the pork chop, which was butchered in house, and it was fantastic.  I can't wait to go back to try a bottle from their extensive Italian wine list (including a Ghemme, which is a rare treat in California).  We dined indoors, but the outdoor seating looked quite appealing.  The staff is crisply professional and knowledgeable.</text>

<Review>Sociale is super cute. I love how it's hidden off the street between buildings. The main room and secondary room aesthetic seemed a bit off... a bit funeral home-y with the thick draperies over fake, brick walls and simple, white paint on other walls. Not a ton of charm on the interior, but the patio was adorable.

Service was spectacular - there was quite a long wait between starter and entree (the server didn't even take our dinner order until after the small plates were finished), as other reviewers had mentioned, but that didn't bother me so much. It was a very casual and relaxed environment to enjoy conversation and good food.

We had the fried olives and the pork belly, which were both delicious. They also serve small, warm biscuits/rolls with butter. I love that they were warm and... well... I love bread.

For dinner, I had the Wagyu Bavette Steak. I was a little disappointed - for the price, I really expected something pretty great, but it was a tough cut of meat that was overdone and had a pretty bland and overall game-y flavor.

The wine selection is pretty good and pretty extensive.

I would consider giving it another go and possibly trying the pasta instead, but at this point, I would not recommend to my friends.<//Review>< Pics>

Curutan< /username><Text>I went here for a private work dinner; since it was my first (and only - so far ;) ) time there, I'm not actually sure if the menu I saw was the regular menu or a private one. Either way, the food was amazing! To start, I had the burrata (the yellow beets and cheese went very well together). Followed by the pappardelle with duck (sooo tasty). Finally, I finished with the seven layer ice cream cake (a refreshing end to the meal). I also had a taste here and there of other menu items, such as a the chocolate oblivion cake (a taste was perfect, but I think it would've been too rich for me to have the whole piece). And all the courses were paired with wine. The staff were very attentive throughout, refilling glasses of wine and water, and generally around to answer any questions. Overall, had an amazing experience here and I definitely want to come back soon.</Text>< response>

<Text>DON'T EVEN FOR A SECOND THINK OF GOING TO THIS RESTURANT.  THE STAFF INCLUDING THE BUS BOYS ARE JUST PLAIN  NASTY.
35 MINUTES BETWEEN 1ST COURSE AND ENTREE WITH NO APOLOGIES FROM ANY ONE. THERE ARE SO MANY RESTURANTS IN.SAN FRANCISCO WHICH ALL MAKE A HUGE EFFORT TO PLEASE.
A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE  !!!!!!!!!<//Text>< GmapID>

<resp>None</resp><Text>This is the perfect neighborhood restaurant.  The food is absolutely wonderful (don't miss the brick chicken), the service is warm, welcoming and efficient.  It's a bit cramped (and noisy) and the decor is nothing special but it's really a very nice addition to the neighborhood.  We just love the place.</Text>< user_id>

Delicious food... Kale salad was my favorite. Four stars as it's a little pricey.</Review>

The salsa is awesome, different kinds at different spice levels.

Service is always on par. Always CLEAN and Fresh. My only complaint is twice I have come for nachos to go and they were burned. Hench only four stars. The cheese and chips. But the food is Tasty.  Still love it.</Text>

<review>I’m disappointed
2 of 3 tacos were fresh 1 taco meat was dry
Place is a little messy
Place it’s worn off chairs floors etc
And the 2 ladies on site are trying there best to run the restaurant by them self’s

Thanks corporate I never stopping at this place again<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

So EZ to finish drying the car. Cost of vacuum in the price and there a more than enough vacuums to keep things moving. Priced competitively with any other carwash.

The $10 wash is their best, but never the best. Vaccum cleaners suck, and not in a good way. Staff is cool though!! #WearAMask< /review>

Have been here twice in the last month. The place is pretty cheap. No touch carwash. Main complaint was with the way the car wash options are in the touch screen menu where you pay - it's designed to make you choose the most expensive one by default (I think it's at the top of the list). There is no back button to quickly change the selection too 🤷🏽‍♂️.

The entire wash is automated - there is one person at the entrance who checks to make sure your wheels go into the rails properly. But because of the touch-less wash, sometimes your car comes out not very clean. Like, last time we had to manually pick a bunch of stuff off of my car, after the wash.

Also, I think the place uses too much water for the wash. I hope they recycle the water somehow.<//text>

<Text>I really like this place. I have been a few times. I went during the day on a week day. So I don't know how crowded on the weekend. It is $7-10 bucks. You pay machine and drive through. There are attendants on hand if you need help. It was quick and easy. Also free vacuum stations and spaces to dry your car if you need. The surrounding area is a bit crowded but the place itself is decent. Think they are open until 7pm during the week but double check.< /Text>< date>

<Text>I like this place. Even I moved further way from this place, I still come back here to clean my car. Cheap and well done job for cleaning. I tried couple different spot but this one is the best so far. Pretty spacious . I don't understand complainers here. What are you expecting for 7-10 dollar all include car wash place?? Spend more money!!<//Text></record>

In times of Covid the staff did not even wear gloves and mask, also there is no soap water or hand sanitizer for coustumers to clean their hands. At least the vacuums are free but they do not clean that well. Everything for 7 dollars!</Text>

Love this spot. Cant find another that will charge me just $5 & can vacuum my own car too. Bad part is, I lost one of mats here smh for rushing. Other bad part, not all the vacuums work but most of them do.< /Review>

The Blue Wave Car Wash is an decent spot to receive the automatic drive thru car wash and getting an chance to vaccum afterwards. It's nothing sparkly, but if you need an basic wash this place works.</text>

<Pics>None</Pics><Review>09/2016: Been going there for a while. Told them repeatedly about the spray jets that need to be fixed at the beginning of the wash. My car always has soap on it when I exit--the sunroof visor causes this. And for the most part the car is never really dry--I have spend quite a bit of time drying it manually. Also, I always get the deluxe package but the formula never prevents the streaks and spotting that it is supposed to prevent. This is my general experience.

Today was an extraordinary experience though. Never is there a time when the employees not approach the car and impose their assistance. Today as most others I told the clerk I didn't need help--using the kiosk. He reached inwards (between me, the car and kiosk) anyways and retrieved the receipt from the previous customer. I had no issue with that and repeated to the clerk that I did not need his help. However, he reached inward again as I was waiting for my receipt. So of course I nudged his hand away. The clerk apparently became offended.  The clerk was confrontational from this point, even when I proceeded to have the car washed and later when I parked to dry my car--manually. Unfortunately, he declined to be helpful when I offered to let him help me dry my car. He was obviously looking for an altercation but was all talk.

Updated 4/2017: Mr. Helpful still trying to be helpful.  Even offered to extend his helpfulness beyond the boundaries of the car wash--probably because of my rave review. I would just prefer the equipment would work better and my car be dry at the end of the car wash.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2b87063125ec1:0x7671ff57a05d79a0</Gmap_id>< rating>

This is literally the worst car wash that I have ever been to. The car was not clean afterwards, it was still covered in soap. What wasn't soapy wasn't dry. I was about to purchase a membership here and machine wasn't working, and the employee didn't seem to understand that since the machine wasn't working for memberships, that the amount of money that I spent on the single car wash should be applied to a membership cost. I'm glad I didn't get a membership though because the wash was awful the service was terrible and overall it was a bad experience. The location is convenient.< /text>

No complaint about car wash... works ok.
But once you purchase membership.... they keep changing from your credit card ( no word about automatically charging every month )< /Text>

<Text>THE WORST CAR WASH EVER! Old and not safe for the car! I found a lot of scratches around the Car body after the wash. FORGET ABOUT AUTOMATIC DRY! It’s not working properly. Few blinds just scratching your car at the end and that’s it! You gonna need a lot of dry clothes to dry it manually. Vacuum cleaners is not working properly! I wish I could talk to the owner personally because he just rapping his customers<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c2b87063125ec1:0x7671ff57a05d79a0</GmapID></record>

I use the monthly membership option. This allows a carwash when ever you need it for one monthly cost which is less than the per wash price. Their drying fans don't work that well. You do need to dry your car after the way or you get spots. Brushes are a little harsh on your car's finish. Be aware.< /Review>

I went today for the first time and paid cash. The machine dispensed my change and the attendant (a woman employee) gave me SOME of my change and kept three dollars. I let it slide because I didn't want to embarrass her but also because I assumed someone would do some work on the car and it could count as the tip. The wash itself was terrible and left the car unclean and wet. I am never returning again.< /Review>

<Review>The only reason why I gave it 3 stars is due to my car having a lot of soap left on it when coming out of the rinse section & not even the drying part of it blew the soap off 😠😡also the vacuum doesn't have as much sucking power, the term "it sucks is really fitting" now I know why I stopped going here.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><gmap_id>0x80c2b87063125ec1:0x7671ff57a05d79a0</gmap_id></record>

But still regardless, the price is still unbeatable. However, I cancelled the membership & just pay and go.
Today, 7/6/17, I passed by & I wanted to treat my car with the under wash. So I paid $11.00. So upon drying my car, I noticed that none of the underside is wet. I waived for the 2 ladies in the entrance, but it seems that they are staring at me & don't want to come & help.
Then I saw the Korean guy. I told him my concern, but he told me different lies. (1) it only work on moddle part. And because it's too hot day, it quickly dried up. I showed him some parts of the car that are still wet! (2) then he is claiming that if I wanted to do it again, that I need to pay another $2!!! I don't agree, bec I told him that some underneath parts should still remained wet regardless. Then he (3) told me different story, that it might be broken! So I told him straight, that he should rather tell me that than creating diff stories! Then Inasked him about the tire black that I paid! & he like, ok I will do it!!! OF COURSE, I paid for it.
Check this out, after few minutes, he approached me and confirmed that the machine part that normally do the under wash is not working!!' There it goes!!!
Ilthey know that it's not working! For unfortunately they never inform customers!! It's false and rubbing customers!
So for all of you, when you paid for the $11 service, make sure to check that all what you paid for are done!!!!!!!!< /review>< Pics>

This place is not worth the money or time. My entire car is still wet.. the fans dont do anything. After my car air dried I could see that it also didn't get cleaned in many areas. My entire front half was still dirty.< /review>

I go here when I don't need to vacuum my car, only because it does wash te car really well on the outside BUT the vacuums suck so bad they can't even pick up a little dust you have to stick on there and even then it doesn't work that's the downside about this car wash< /review>

<Response>None< /Response><Text>(Translated by Google) I paid for the most expensive wash that has a thousand wonders of soap and wax but nothing, the car did not feel clean. The dryers do not cover the entire car, there are always wet parts. Vacuums too weak. The gloss for the rims was only applied to the left, it means that the right machine does not work.

(Original)
Pagué el lavado más caro que lleva las mil maravillas de jabón y cera pero nada, no senti limpio el carro. Las secadoras no cubren todo el carro, siempre quedan partes mojadas. Las aspiradoras demasiado débiles. El brillo para las llantas solo se aplicó a las izquierdas, quiere decir que la máquina derecha no sirve.</Text>< gmap_id>

Just wanted to stop in and say we have been renting for years with them. From crystal to Michael and Jesse! They are all very helpful and easy to work with. We just recently started our own business. And they helped us set up or customer account. And every time we call we talk with Jesse or Michael, and they make sure we get a  rental. That is customer service right there!!!!< /text>

United Transportation has been working with Ryder for over 10 years, and we rent large volumes from them. Their company always takes the best care of us, making sure we are provided trucks that run well, and if there is ever a mechanical issue, their roadside assistance comes fast and always fixes the issue right away-- the best service IN THE INDUSTRY. United Transportation has a national account, and so we have worked with many branches across the United States, but the branch in Northridge, CA specifically is the absolute best. Crystal Sanchez at this branch, as well as their customer service department, is absolutely fantastic. I highly recommend speaking with her; she always goes above and beyond for our company, she is professional, friendly, hard working, and always given her all to make sure we get the best service. Our company appreciates everything Crystal has done for us. Northridge branch is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!<//Text>

Trucks are good but liftgates they have installed on their trucks are heavier than an usual and it makes it heavier. So less stuff you can load on their trucks to go through a weigh station. Bummer 🙄🙄🙄< /review>

I’d like to share the experiences I have with this Ryder branch in Northridge. Every time I call someone pick up the phone and is so nice and sets me up with a truck. They always make sure the trucks are clean and with low miles. Do not go anywhere else. If you need any heavy duty truck call here and they will help you. Thank you so much Daylan, Crystal, and Ashley for all that you do. I appreciate it as a customer. You guys are the best.</text>

We want to thank Daylan and Crystal for their excellent customer service, they make sure that due to our busy schedule all the rental contracts was completed by the time we got to the office.

Thanks again

Horrible,horrible service by their incompetent supervisor by the name of Ashley.
She refused renting me a truck because my S Corp address is my house address.(how funny)
After verifying me with secretary of state,She  googled my S corp address and refused service to me bacuse my business address is my home.
I went to Rent it truck rental and rented my truck under my business in less than 10 min in and out! !!
I really want Ryder higher authorities read this review and probably send her work at the yard instead of serving customers in front desk.

The people at the front dest are rude to the customer which is me and my company. If I ever own my own truck, I would never go with Ryder just puts you In a bad mood. If that's not enough they are suppose to have spar truck for there customs is there truck breaks down but they never do, most of the time they dont even have the parts on hand to fix your truck. Long waits with nothing done that what you can expect from this Ryder.</review>< pictures>

I placed an online order on Thu Jan 7th 2021.  Told delivey date would be FEB 3rd between 12-4 pm. Then told late aftenoon of the 3rd that it won't be arriving today, and that they would call us and let us know when.

NOTE: we live less than 10 miles from the manufacturing plant yet they won't let us pick it up and it's has taken nearly a month and we still don't have it. Shipper says they have no paperwork on my table and I'm now going back-and-forth between Earthlite and shipper Ceva.

Cost:  $951.83 + Shipping $73.77    Tolal:  $1025.60</Review>

<gmapID>0x80dc74dfaee7fa0d:0xa93e5d1bebdda164< /gmapID><Pics>None<//Pics><review>I ordered a table case for my 2001 table. They didn't have the original case but sent one that would fit my table.  Customer service was very good and the case came within a week.  My only problem is that I liked the original case better.  The pocket for the bolster was vertical and had separate pockets for sheets and other items.  The new one has one pocket which the bolster slides in horizontally and you have to put the sheets and other items on top of that.  Also, the original case's zippers went down to the bottom which made putting in the folded table easy.  The new zippers don't go down to the bottom and you have to lift the table and insert it in just right in order to zip up the case.

I just bought an Earthlite Massage Chair and am pleased with it so far.  The carrying case could be a little bigger so if you don't collapse the chair just right, it will still fit around the chair.

My table has lasted 14 years!!!  I hope my chair does, too!
-Miles of smiles :-) :-) :-)

Phenomenal service. Very informative about their products. Although there's no display or showroom they bring out the product for you to try. This is where the products are manufactured so don't expect IKEA. Quality product also. I've used their tables and chairs for over 15 years and no complaints.< /Text>

I have used quite a few different massage chairs through the years and I always come back to Earthlite for the Vortex model. It's the easiest to adjust and the light weight makes carrying it around to events a relative breeze. The chair came quickly after being ordered and has never let me down.< /Text>

I have owned and used an Earthlite massage table since the late 1980's!! The zippered case deteriorated but the table is in perfect condition. I take very good care of it and am no longer a professional massage therapist, but I do still use it regularly. I cannot recommend this table highly enough. It is a superlative product.</Text>

I ordered the Earthlite Spirit Massage table package as well as a table cover flannel sheets and regular sheets and other massage warehouse products. I have to say so far the table is holding up very well. I hope it will last a very long time for me. Great comfortable table and was the top seller Table with 3inch foam and adjustable headrest.  Love the products I have ordered.< /review>

It is very manageable to transport to class and to clients' homes and the height of the table is easy to adjust.  My clients have expressed that the table is very comfortable as well.  Many students in my class have a different brand (that is more expensive) and my Earthlite is very comparable to their tables.  I am very happy with my purchase and when I set up my own business I will definitely purchase another Eartlite!</text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80dc74dfaee7fa0d:0xa93e5d1bebdda164< /Gmap_id></record>

I absolutely love my Earthlite products. The quality is outstanding! I have an older table but have recently purchased bolsters, sheets and a cart for this table. The table is a portable one that I acquired from another therapist. It has proven to be one of the best purchasing decisions I have made. Since the products I have already had proven the test of time, wear and tear I put them through daily, I did not have to think twice when going back to Earthlite to purchase a massage chair for my daughter in her practice. The folks are the best to work with at Earthlite and there is no reason to go anywhere else for our future needs. Thank you!<//Text>

<Review>Hi All, Bad News! Earthlite claims to offer high quality, best in the business products and I believed them. Within 4 years the massage table vinyl on 4 tables started to fall apart. The company claims they made a mistake and purchased biodegradable vinyl. My past experience with them was great, I had purchased two tables from them in 1996 and they are still in great shape. Now the company is NOT willing to replace the tables. They claim they are out of warranty! They will offer a 35% discount to replace them, which isn't good enough. They made the mistake, not me. The big mistake I made was in trusting  Earthlite.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

I purchased your stool. It is very comfortable and I love that it adjusts higher and lower than others I have used in the past.
I wish I had gone with the beige color. Instead I got the black and it shows every hand print.  =/  And ....not sure about the upholstery. The hand prints don't just wipe away.</Text>

Great products, excellent value, and knowledgable, professional service.
I own 2 Spirit tables and also have a Luna for outcalls.  Clients often remark on how comfortable the tables are, and I feel confident with the work load and stability.
I also feel fortunate my studio isn't too far away, I can save on shipping and pop over to their warehouse to pick up supplies like oil and sheets, and to check out what's in their "discontinued" bin :)
Thanks, Earthlite!<//text></record>

<Review>Nice table, strong and wide.  For Chiropractic use the head rest paper holder does not release the paper smoothly for a fast pull and rip move.  You have to slowly feed it....The face piece is just ok.   It's nice looking and adjustable in height.  It will do for a room that doesn't see a lot of patients.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>I have come to loathe having to contact a companies customer service department lately - not sure how companies keep surviving with terrible customer service, but I was pleasantly surprised with Earthlite! I spoke to a Ramona who wasn't only friendly and professional, she actually helped me to quickly get done what I needed without any hassles and provided the least amount of down time for the company... I am now purposefully taking the time to write the good reviews - saves time that way as there are too many bad ones. This company earned my business for sure today!< /Review>< Pics>

I bought a portable Earthlite massage table back in about 1998.  Recently, during a move, I lost one of the knobs that secures the wooden piece for adjusting leg length. I called and talked with a delightful representative who most graciously provided me with the information I needed and got a replacement knob to me in just a couple of days!  I highly recommend Earthlite's massage table and commend the the company for wonderful customer service!< /Text>

I've had an Earthlite portable massage table for 10 years -- I think it's a Harmony.  It has held up very well under frequent use, averaging about once per week.  It is very sturdy.  While portable, I would say it is more luggable as it isn't light and a bit awkward but there is the trade off for being sturdy.  Even with all the use, it still looks new.  If I had too, I would buy another but this one is holding up and look forward to another 10 years!<//review>

I bought two replacement cylinders for 2 stools that I have, both were defective!  That's the bad news.  The good news is that Earthlite sent two replacements no problem.  So it kind of balanced out in the end.  Thanks!</text>

<user_name>Karin< /user_name><Text>Very easy people to deal with, and the table is beautiful.  The only glitch was that it was "dropped" at the bottom of the stairs of my office, and I had to scramble to have someone carry this enormous piece up to my office.  Apparently I chose "curbside" delivery when I ordered it??  I have absolutely no recollection of this, and would never have chosen it to be delivered this way.  I wasn't very happy at delivery time.  But the customer service were very kind just the same.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

All went well though the driver's direction was to leave the container at curbside.

This made it almost impossible to bring into the building since its weight was over 300 lbs.

Fortunately with a $20 tip the driver was obliging and helped to deliver the table to the door of the room in which it was to be placed.<//Text>

We ordered our "spirit" table from Earthlite. It did arrive quickly. As we set it up we noticed that the legs have to be extended carefully as there is no support (unlike a much cheaper table we have)connecting the two legs from either end with each other, thus there is a risk of breaking part of the table if you do not hold both legs, one in each hand and move them simultaneously. As soon as we set it up and tested it out, one of the bed supports snapped. We called Earhtlite and left a message to which we never got a response. I called back and talked to someone who said it would be forwarded on and I should expect a call back. We did not get a return call so I called again. I explained my dilemma and this time they forwarded me on to one of their associates. I explained the situation and how we had clients booked expecting to have this additional table. Earthlite seemed indifferent to my plight and the fact that we had to call and move clients. We had to wait five days to get a replacement despite them being 5 hours away.
The Sierra Comfort table we had first is not as wide but seems just as sturdy and comfortable yet cost 1/5th the price.<//Text>

The products are made well. What I did not like was the limited amount of replacement parts available for sale. I have a harmony with a broken wood panel on the front end. I was disappointed to discover that Earthlite does not have things like this available for purchase. I called and a operator told me they don't do that. Well I think they should it would increase their profits as well as customer loyalty. Maybe some day until then, here's hoping.<//review>

Purchased 3 Earthlite table warmers for 3 different tables over 3 years.  One quit working after a month and I called and they sent another within 7 days.  Other than that they are thick, warm and temp control has auto shutoff.  It curls at the edges on 2 of the 3 for some reason and thats annoying.  But overall, I like them.< /Review>

bed was delivered in adequate amount of time. The bed is amazing. no issues. No news is good news. Down side? If you order and don't want to give your opinion, you get harassed to give an opinion. Don't really appreciate that.<//Review>

I'm disappointed. The elastic band of the new massage chair replacement cover is quite snug and when the seat cover is placed over the seat, it looks absolutely perfect - just like in the picture. BUT, when you sit on it and work on your client/patient and get up again, the back side has pulled up a bit and the seat cover gets wrinkly and looks dumb and messy. Not just a little bit - it's quite obvious. I've pulled it back many times now, and even tried overcompensating for the sliding by really making it as tight as possible in the back, but it creeps creeping up and looks stupid. The elastic band should probably be a drawstring as I want to make it way tighter than the band can do by itself. I might bring in some thread and try tightening the bottom band more if possible (it might tear?). Or maybe I'll try stapling it on with a powerful stapler. I would have rather purchased the whole base with the seat cover stapled to the bottom for $50 or whatever because this is just dumb. I don't have time for this.</Review>

My first  massage table purchased in 1999, is still going strong and being used daily. My 2nd table (bought 2004) ended up with a crack in the frame, but due to Earthlite's awesome warranty, is being replaced.

Earthlite builds quality tables and chairs that last!!! They endure the hard work we ask of them.

I went with another company for a massage chair, and quickly learned the error of my ways and replaced it with an Earthlite!!!< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I purchased my first table from you about twenty years ago. It was in perfect condition when I sold after fifteen years prior to my world traveling adventures. Now settled down again with a new set of clients, of course my choice was EarthLite.

Being pretty disappointed in, yet understanding of, the disguise of free shipping, I'll advise this company to make more bold the fine print that speaks of exclusions to that coupon.

An even greater disappointment was the promise of a three-business-day delivery. This important lesson taught me to wait to schedule clients until products arrive! Over the course of the next eight days, my trips to the post office twenty minutes away only led to further disgust because of the seemingly missing table. Low and behold, a voicemail finally comes from Fed-Ex stating the package had been there for about a week. How was I to know Fed-Ex didn't deliver to post offices? I wish I knew that piece of apparently common knowledge. This information needed to be posted in bold font when purchasing on-line!

And now for the great news...EarthLite agreed! They refunded the expensive shipping costs, and they even said 'thank you' for bringing this to their attention. Each of the customer service department members I had the pleasure of politely whining to was kind, patient, and willing to listen and take action.
Good going, EarthLite!< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I've had my Earthlink massage table for years.  After 18 years of hard use it still looks like new. I just ordered a new face cradle for another table on Sunday from Earthlink aND I got it on Tuesday.  I'M very happy with them, no complaints here.<//text>

I love the workers! They treat all of the volunteers with respect and are always making sure that we're doing ok. They always want the best for their volunteers and are always grateful for us when we show up. Grateful for them.<//Text>

I thought that I'd gotten a good deal. Then I found out the truth. The rims weren't for my truck. To make the rims fit they installed the TPCM wrong. I found that out when I had to replace the rims. I replaced the rims because when I had my routine maintenance performed they couldn't remove the rims to rotate them because the center cap screws were stripped. Mind you Deals on Wheels were supposed to order me "extra" screws I didn't know that the screws weren't extra but that I needed them because apparently they knew that the screws were stripped. Wheels are a safety issue, even when they're cosmetic.  Through it all, Juan was a nice guy and always seemed ready to accommodate.< /text>

I HIGHLY recommend @dealsonwheels_jaime in Concord. We walked in looking for some wheels, rims and a lift and talked with Jaime and he really knows how to run his store. He was patient with me and making sure I'm satisfied while taking care of phone calls and everyone else asking for help. He even off hours put the tires on the wheels and sent me pictures to ensure I was happy. Definitely 5⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ business. Check out his work follow him and go done and get hooked up!!

Juan is professional honest, fair and runs a great business.He has done a lot of work on my vehicles and does excellent work. He researches the products he sells and makes great recommendations. I had a problem with two tires I purchased and he stood behind them without a question.< /review>

The sales associate said, "yeah yeah we have our in stock". When we got there it was 20 minutes before he came out from the shop to see what we needed. Told him that w called 10 minutes ago for the specified tires we wanted. He said he had to go make a hard check(physically look). What do you mean hard check? He assured us on that call which was just 30 minutes ago by this time, that he had them. I waisted my time!!! Too bad I will never recommend them to anyone!! Incompetent and ignorant as well as knowledgeable..he should be fired.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

came in the afternoon with a emergency tire replacement, they looked at it and told me about 30min. Pricing was great, so I waited for a opening, but they had the tire change done in 30 minutes!! I would highly recommend them to everyone. I know i will be back to replace the other 3 tires next week.</review>

I ordered a small hot coffee and they charged me for an iced coffee. i had to wait outside for a new one and the girl that brought out my hot coffee lied to me, when i asked her for my refund for the difference between the hot coffee and the iced coffee, she said that the iced coffee was cheaper and that the hot coffee was more expensive. I refuse to make a big deal over change that is less than a dollar, but it’s the lack of integrity that i have an issue with.<//Review>

<text>There breakfast is ok not the best but not the worst the main reason for the 3 is the lack of selection they have.

<Review>Update:  This location has significantly improved its meal preparation since my last review (below).  This location is always fast and superbly courteous.   Thank you, Jack in the Box!

Fast and courteous. However, their food quality is terrible.  They need to find a balance and not sacrifice their food preparation in the pursuit for speed.</Review>< Pictures>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>The burger had too much sauce on it. Loved the bun. I wish there were pickles. Fries were too salty but I think bette than mcdonald's but I'm also bias against mcdonald's- uber ordered a cheeseburger only to eat half, realize it wasn't cooked and still very pink, food poisoning for three days. Their apologetic response: free meal -.-

Jacks was great, I'll just know what to modify next time.

Don't get their donut holes. Barely any cinnamon sugar AND it just tastes plain. No glaze. Wasnt a fan.< /Text>< Pictures>

Maybe add some napkins to the bags in the drive through. I know it is a ballbuster and difficult for those working there, but it helps quite a bit. It was our second day of the power outage in Fallbrook, so we decided to eat in the vehicle. Had to drive far away because there were dozens of rodents scurrying around the drive through area eating discarded eggs. 2 stars for being generous with the ranch for my wife though.< /review>

For Fast Food, 5 Stars. Why? I can grab a quick bite to eat for a family of 10 and not pay an arm & a leg. Burger, tacos and more, no problem. Plus, the staff at the 79 restaurant, have always been amazing. You want extra lettuce, tomato, pickle & onion, you got it. It won't be wilted either.< /Text>

This location is okay. For some reason, I've never gotten a fresh batch of fries. The sandwiches on the other hand are good enough for this caliber of fast food restaurant. There is/was a lady by the name of Tammy that work/worked the night shift and she had exceptional drive thru customer service. I now get bottled water since they did away with their flavored iced teas. Overall, it's not the worse but not at the top of the fast food restaurant grade.</Text>

Service was fast, but they forgot to put my fajita pita in the bag, so after I checked I told them they just apologized and gave me my pita. Imagine if I drove away with out checking it. Always check your bag.</text>

<pics>None</pics><Review>I was greeted at the door by Jack of all trades. He proceeded to follow me to the restroom where he made sure I properly washed my hands. From there, I proceeded to the counter,where Jack recommended the breakfast platter. For my better half, He recommended the sausage egg and cheese biscuit without the egg. We got to the table where my girl ripped open her sandwich wrapper, reached over with this mad cow look in her eyes, and confiscated my sausage Patti, which she threw on her biscuit. All in all a good visit.<//Review>< username>

Great service everytime I go here. Although this last time I got a breakfast sandwich when I ordered a Cheeseburger. The people here are always happy and smiling, the food for the most part is always hot and the drive thru is relatively fast as well.</review>

Always clean and always fast.  My husband and I frequent this place for breakfast. Usually we go through the drive through but once in a while we go inside.  Never have any problems.  I love their supreme croissants.<//review>

<Text>I just left this location, I was in the drive-through. The guy at the window called me boss, my food was cold but I did not discover it until after I had driven away. I don’t have time to turn around and fight this traffic to go inside to tell them.  I went through the drive-through as I was short on time.</Text>< pictures>

Listen Up Corporate!
I moved away from Temecula & am clearing my storage unit.  It has been a horrible trip, but wouldn't be complete without a stop at Jack in The Box! (Always addicted to your tacos)  The girl, Kiana, who took my order was the most amazing person!
Greeted me with a smile, was compassionate & made my day!
Employees don't come around that often like her!  Management Material!  Take care of her Jack & thanks for my Tacos ❤  Will miss you!< /Review>

This location was really slow. There wasn't much of a line. The staff didn't know the menu and ran around trying to answer a simple question. The run around created a line. I ordered a chicken salad and they were really skimpy with the chicken.</Text>

Not open 24 hours, so after the marine corps ball decided to get drunk and go get food and aye a restuarant that says it's open 24/7 everyday. Then when we got there the workers told us it was closed. Talk about false advertisement, that is illegal so yall better fix your signs< /review>

<text>It's a convenient fastfood place opens 24/7, food and serives are mostly good and friendly.  Love their 100+ freestyle soda machine, which offers virtually endless options of softdrink.  The bad parts are "some folks without permanent shelters" hanging around during late hours and a portion of "human garbage" trashing the premise.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Now that they have the computerized coke machine the soda tastes like crap. The last 2 times I've ordered a coke i don't even know what this tastes like. It's sorta citrus, diet, regular coke....</text>
