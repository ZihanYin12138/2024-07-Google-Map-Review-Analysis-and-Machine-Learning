<Review>Well I thought many of these reviews were fabricated but I can tell you first hand these guys are legit.
I just got a boat that is in Huntington Harbor Marina and the carpet was in bad shape. They did a great job and well worth it. Good job Brandon and his partner.</Review>< Pictures>

They came out and did a sample spot and gave me a bid. It is worth every penny! The workers were very thorough. Moved my furniture and put it all back properly. Professional.

Coastal Breeze has cleaned our rugs and carpets several times and we continue to be impressed each visit. They use family friendly products that are safe and effective and they help keep our carpets looking and feeling clean! No gross soapy residue feeling! They have always been prompt, letting us know when they are on the way and are a cinch to schedule with! Will continue to recommend them! Thanks Desiree + Brandon!<//review>

We used Coastal Breeze  carpet care yesterday for the first time. Brandon is the owner and does all the carpet cleaning. His wife manages the rest of the business. They were  everything I could want in a carpet cleaner. They text the day before they were to come. He showed up on time and did an outstanding job. The carpets look great! I don’t think I will ever look for another carpet cleaner after having Brandon.<//Text>

I've used Coastal Breeze both personally and professionally for clients on numerous occasions and can't say enough good things about them.  They always show up on time, are courteous and do a wonderful job.  They have cleaned carpet that I didn't think could be cleaned and have also told me when it didn't make sense to clean it and to save my money.  I would highly recommend them.< /Review>

Mark and Anthony were fantastic. They arrived early, helped move the furniture with me, and got to work. They removed a stain from a fairly new couch that I was afraid was permanent - a HUGE relief. I would highly recommend.</text>

<text>Very friendly and professional owner. I Love that their products are non-toxic, environment friendly and pet friendly!!  Brandon knows what he’s doing and made the process straightforward  and stress free. Our carpets haven’t been cleaned in 4 years.. they had various stains, weird dark brown spots and just obvious wear in the high traffic areas and that’s ALL gone! Our stairs look brand new and they were probably the worst.  I fell back in love with my living room area rug again now that it looks almost new (it’s various shades of white/cream and silver) and almost 5 years old!  Great job Coastal Breeze, I will use you again and recommend to everyone I know!< /text><Rating>5<//Rating><userid>108454061139018429649< /userid><Name>Beauty by Robyn<//Name>< gmap_id>

<review>I’ve been using Coastal Breeze for several years after inconsistent results from a couple big national companies or using coupons or flyers to get cheap prices for shoddy jobs. This is a young local family and they are on top of their business. They have helped me with repairs to my older, expensive Karastan area rugs and made sure my pet stains/odors were addressed. Fabulous job on all upholstery and worked on a Sunday responding  to my last minute “911” call for a pre Thanksgiving sofa emergency. Love his products, doesn’t leave soapy residue or a water logged mess. Going to have him clean and seal my floors and showers next. Great company, great service, local HB family. You will be happy.</review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Did an amazing job, was on time and even put up with my over bearing dog, who has a lot of love to give. The dog is also the reason the couch needed to be cleaned, so I am sure I will be using Costal Breeze again.< /review>

Desiree is Awesome! She communicates well and is very easy to get a hold of by phone or email. Any time I need her she always responds right away and for me that's really important. I really don't like it to have to wait days for a response. I think their pricing is really fair and think they do spectacular work. You can see the tons of before and after photos. I also love the idea of supporting local HB businesses. Great work, Great price!< /Review>

We have used them twice when moving out of homes and both times we got our full deposit back and both landlords commented on how amazing the carpets looked.

Dr. Vinh Nguyen at Memorial Care is the best doctor anyone could ever have. He is very kind and he helps you figure out strategies to improve your health. He is professional and is outstanding in every way as your doctor. He listens and goes the extra mile to help you with your health success. I am an older person (over 60) and feel he has a kind heart and is extremely smart and knowledgable. He will ensure you are getting the absolute best care. I feel fortunate to have found such a special and gifted doctor.< /Review>

Covid has changed everything, including a visit to your doctor.  Dr Nguyen was very comfortable conversing via web and had my history at his finger tips to be able to review my concerns and needs.  Voice was clear and he was  able to outline a plan to move forward with, without making snap judgements or raising barriers to block what I felt was best for me.< /Review>

Dr. Vinh Nguyen advice is very logic and sounded, willingness to listen and discuss. Memorialcare staff are organized and friendly. Network and My Chart portal is the best. Patient health records can be viewed at anytime and at anywhere. Appointment schedule and communication online are made easily and friendly. Facility is clean. A definitely 5 * for me.</text>

Dr. Nguyen is a superstar.  He is personable, highly intelligent, current in his field, and diagnosis accurately.  Dr. Nguyen and his entire staff provide excellent service and care.  I have been going to Dr. Nguyen at Memorial Health Care for years with great satisfaction.  Their system to coordinate services among providers and their communication system with patients are stellar.  I consider myself lucky to have Dr. Nguyen and Memorial Heath Care in my community.<//Text>

< Review>
I joined Orange Theory on June 4, 2019. I've attended approximately 91 classes in less than 120 days spread across 11 different gyms in the U.S. My "home" gym is Roseville, CA and it is by far, my favorite. The staff has become my 2nd family because they are friendly, caring, focused and fun to be around in and outside of the gym. OT has changed my life mentally and physically. At 53 years young, I'm in the best shape I've been in since flying in the U.S. military. I have a strong science/medical informatics background and these workouts are science backed. I'm driven by data and results. OT made me a believer within my first 10 workouts. Give it a try. Go for one month. See for yourself.< /Review>

< review>
I'm extremely grateful to Orangetheory because it's definitely made me a happier and healthier person. I'm a teacher and used to have the classic excuse of just not having time to workout. I always prioritized others instead of prioritizing myself even occasionally. I knew something had to change, though. I joined Orangetheory to attempt to bring more strength and positivity into my life and it's definitely done that. The huge variety of class times and workouts make Orangetheory a doable program for even the busiest people. I'm extremely grateful to Coach Rockin in Roseville and Coach Chandler in Rocklin for helping me to rediscover my physical and mental strength and endurance. I look forward to coming to class every time it's on my calendar!</review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Yesterday my daughter talked me into going to my first workout. Our trainer , Rocklin, was awesome, he was helpful and explained the process and use of the equipment clearly. I like the the dynamics of the studio, the equipment and the studio were high end, the music was inspiring , and the group setting gave it a team feel. Everyone working to be stronger and fit. The girls at the front desk were also as friendly as can be. Needless to say I joined. I can’t wait for my next workout, probably another day or so, I’m a little sore, but that’s a good thing😊< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I love my workouts at Orange Theory. The workouts are intense and challenging. I can reach my goals in less than an hour and my workout is done. The studio is nice and clean and the staff and trainers are AMAZING! Champ, Sydney and Jennifer are fantastic. I have also been enjoying having Darren as a coach. He motivates us and makes it fun!<//text>

I have been going to Orangetheory for over a year. I have spent a lifetime trying to lose weight and nothing has ever worked for me. The enthusiastic and nurturing environment at OTF was just what I needed. I have had incredible results and I absolutely love it. The coaches and staff are the absolute best. The combination workout of cardio and weights is a perfect balance and the hour goes by very quickly. Their app also makes scheduling very convenient.<//Review>

Workout awesome! Trainer awesome!!! Staff behind the counter, not so awesome. The dude was a total deufis. Had the same problem at another location. Orangetheory get your staff trained better. They need be more informative of rules. Especially at initiation. No demonstration, here is your wrist band and good luck!!!!<//Review>

Come in, listen to workout instructions, kill it for an hour, and you’re done. It’s hard work but worth it. All of the coaches are incredible as well. Motivating, kind, helpful, upbeat, everything you want in a coach. If you want results, OT is the place for you!<//text>< userid>

<text>So I am a 38 year old over weight man 5ft 9in weighing about 250lbs. I love this place the workout always changes and it is very structured. They will always tell you what to do. The workouts are tough and fast but if you keep on pushing you will adjust. Give it a try!!< /text>< pics>

Nice studio that is well-kept. The front staff is extremely friendly. I’ve only been to this location 3 times, all of which were with Daniel, which have been great. Push yourself, eat clean, and you’ll see progress in no time.<//review>

Daniel was a fun instructor. He was detailed which helped me remember posture in the weight room. He is also lively and it was funny to hear how he was trying to incorporate country music towards at the end of our stretch.<//Review>

I have had many patients who really feel encouraged by the way they fit the workout to their level of activity they are at.  I think it is each & every persons responsibility to hold themselves accountable.  It's no one elses fault if you fail to thrive at exercise!  Great concept at Orange Theory!  I plan to join this weekend!!< /review>

So far I'm enjoying my experience at OTF. The staff are supportive, it's easy to schedule, scheduled workouts force me to be accountable. I dislike exercise, (the gym kind, I enjoy outdoor activities) but I really do feel that I'm learning how to use a gym as well as getting my body back on track.<//Review>

<review>I started my journey at 377 lbs, all-time high BP of 230/110, and had high cholesterol and congestive heart failure. Then i hit rock bottom with cardiac arrest from atrial fibrillation. After having heart and weight loss surgery two years ago, I knew I needed to work physical activity into my lifestyle in order to continue forward on my journey.I knew OTF was the answer for me, because i had been a member a few years before, but my head just wasn't in the game at the time. Getting going wasn't easy. All the physical and mental sluggishness was there, but the coaches and staff are encouraging and welcoming. Most importantly, the other members are more of a community than a room full of random strangers. You form relationships. That's huge for keeping you motivated and accountable.The classes are well designed for complete and overall effectiveness, and to make sure you get the most out of your time, every time. Coaches demonstrate all the exercises, and offer alternatives and modifications to help with different fitness levels or physical limitations. My wife and I have found an overall fitness home at OTF, and going together is a part of our ongoing journey. Now, over 150 pounds lighter, regular BP, no cholesterol meds - no daily meds at all - I'm ready for that next Dri-Tri. But you'll see me at OT almost every day until then. Fitness is no longer a goal for me, it's a reality. OTF makes it easy, and rewarding, to stay on track.< /review><Resp>None<//Resp><rate>5<//rate><userid>100789425921164450510<//userid><name>Justin Prahar<//name>< Time>

I love Orangetheory Roseville. The staff are amazing, the workouts are super fun and engaging. Even my hubby loves to come along with me at least 1-2 times per week.< /review>

I hate going to the gym, but I actually look forward to going to Orange Theory Fitness - I don't have to think about what I am going to do and I get a really good workout! The personal trainer feel in a group setting makes the cost worth it. Sure, it is a little more expensive than other gym memberships but what you get out of it is worth it.</review>

<Review>OTF has been a game changer for me! I literally hated everything about working out. My husband, who is a triathlete, would keep nagging me to run with him, or workout and I despised it. Then an old boss told me about OTF. I tried my first class and was instantly hooked! I had to take a break for a few months but when I was able to come back, I immediately fell back into it. I am addicted now. I look forward to every single workout; especially the 0630 90min workout on Saturday's! Thank you OTF for giving me an outlet I never knew I wanted or needed.< /Review><gmapID>0x809b1fefe8c3f74b:0x6776b0e411deb494</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Hi,  I’m in a place in my life (kids are grown, and taking off with my husband), .....where I want to workout on my own schedual. I’m out of town a lot and in a variety of physical activities. Hiking, mountain biking ect...
I love my workout time at 6am when home, but never hounded and asked: “where have you been”?
I enjoy ALL the instructors,  ALL incouraging and helpfull.
I’m very happy with my program and Orange Therory.<//text>

I love OTF Roseville! The workouts are never the same and are always challenging.  The coaches are energetic and knowledgeable.  Once they get to know you, they find ways to challenge you on the cardio floor and weight floor -- they truly want to help you meet your goals.  They encourage you when you are wanting to slack off and are supportive when you are having an off day (or nursing an injury.)  The sales associates are friendly and greet everyone by name (I still haven't figured out how they know the names of 700 members--impressive!) I can't imagine my life without my daily dose of my OTF family.</Review>

<Text>I like the guidance by the coach, the diversity during the workouts so it feels like they go by quickly and they keep my mind and body busy, it is a full body workout and I love the motivational style of OrangeTheory people and its philosophy.</Text>< Pics>

My home has very light colored, almost white carpets in the bedrooms only, and now they look brand new! I had two bedrooms done, one being my teenage son’s room. Every stain from his sport shoes and cowboy boots is now gone. Very professional, quick, and did a fantastic job for us this morning.</review>

I have three dogs and my carpets were a dirty mess. I was expecting one man to show up to do the cleaning and two came. They were on time and immediately on top of things. I just rent and my carpets haven't looked this good since I moved in about 10 years ago. I have had some bad experiences with other carpet cleaners but SLO Steam Carpet Cleaning will be my go to for a good cleaning job from now on. Great service, considerate & a super cleaning job...can't go wrong with this company as far as I am concerned. AWESOME!</text>

Will Majano did an amazing job! When he left, the carpets looked almost like they did when they were brand new. I was able to schedule him online for the next day (on a weekend) and he arrived within the scheduled arrival window, and was done in about 1.5 hours for a whole house. The text update alerts were really convenient. His prices were very reasonable and I would recommend him for anyone that needs carpets cleaned.<//text>

We have used SLO Steam's services for many years now, and they always leave us with immaculately clean carpets and grout! They are quick, efficient, and professional. Along with their talent in various cleaning services their employees are friendly and accommodating. We enjoy using their new online reservation platform which makes it easy to book how many rooms or spaces you need cleaned! Stubborn stains and dirty carpets are no match for SLO Steam!< /review>

Slo Steam is excellent. These guys are professionals with a professional set up. Very friendly, efficient, and they do quality work. They cleaned our apartment carpets quickly and we had an emailed invoice immediately upon completion. Great experience with Slo Steam.<//Review>

<Text>Had my carpets cleaned on March 31 (yesterday) by Slo Steam.  Will did an amazing job!  The carpet in one room was heavily stained and it now looks great. I didn't expect it to look as good as it does.  Very affordable, professional and personable.  Despite the situation our world is in now, every precaution was taken to ensure safety!  Couldn't have asked for more!< /Text><Date>1585784012170</Date>< rate>

< Review>
Will is great. They have always had a quick turn-around time in my experience. I use him at work and for my personal home, and he is dedicated to delivering a quality clean. It seems to be more and more rare to find people who actually care about the quality of their work, but Will is definitely someone who cares.< /Review>

<Text>I got a call from Will saying he was on his way  for appointment. I liked that he kept me in the loop. Once at my home he followed all safety procedures  and was amazing in his knowledge of what it would take to clean my carpet for the long haul. He was also very fast, on schedule, and  I think went above board on his attention to small details. One last thing. If you have pets, you have got to call Will Majano please< /Text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1590682211667, 'text': 'Thank you Jim'}<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80ecdbce94f3bb37:0xebcc8cd9f3dd597f</Gmap_id></record>

Will and his team at SLO Steam are the best carpet cleaners in San Luis Obispo. They are very professional and pleasant to interact with. I called other carpet cleaning companies and Slo Steam provided a great price and explained their services thoroughly. Not only were they priced well, but they also spent extra time on several trouble spots and high traffic areas, which other carpet cleaners try to upsell. Highly recommended! Best carpet cleaners in SLO county. Thanks Will!<//text>

<Text>Outstanding job! Our carpets hadn’t been cleaned in years and were absolutely filthy, but Will came to clean them and spent a lot of extra time trying to get out all the stains. He truly went above and beyond and we are so grateful for all his hard work. He was so kind and willing to answer all my questions about the cleaning process. The carpets look wonderful, the price was affordable, and scheduling was easy. We’ll definitely be using them again if we need our carpets cleaned!</Text><user_name>Jessica Gonzales<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

I recently just bought my first home And the carpet wasn’t cutting it for me. I was going to spend a whole bunch of money on replacing it, but glad I didn’t! Will did an amazing job with making the carpet look and feel brand new. I couldn’t be happier with the results. I was also satisfied with the customer service, very nice guy. I definitely recommend calling Slow Steam Carpet Cleaning to get the job done. You won’t regret it< /text>< Pics>

I received excellent service from Will yesterday. I called him around noon and explained what I needed done. He arrived at 3:00 and worked on 3 rooms and my sectional and couch. I was first impressed with his confidence that he could and would get my place spic n span, which he actually did! Stains gone, everything smelling fresh and clean, and he even moved  stuff around! Very polite and courteous and very diligent worker. I am recommending Will/SLO Steam to family, friends, and neighbors! He did a lot of work, and can’t beat the price. Thanks!</review>

<text>Highly recommend. I just purchased a sofa and love seat off craigslist and moved them into my new apartment. Considering these are COVID times and having just acquired used couches, I decided getting them professionally cleaned was definitely needed and smart. I called SLO Steam on Sunday at 2pm and Will answered immediately. I told him what I needed done and asked if he could come same day, he quoted me over the phone and said he could be at my place just 2 hours later. He showed up on time, got straight to work and did an amazing and fast job! ¬¬I noticed on his website that he also cleans mattresses so I decided to get that done too. Would highly recommend! I'm enjoying having peace of mind knowing my new couches and mattress are not only nice and clean but freshly sanitized. Thanks SLO Steam!< /text><rate>5</rate></record>

Very happy with the cleaning services we had done today. Extremely professional from the time I made an appointment to when they completed the job. Cleaned up after they finished the job. Priced very reasonably for the services. I will definitely use them again.<//text>

<text>We've had SLO Steam before, and that is why we chose them again! Great job! My Lab got so nervous from all the illegal fireworks on July 4th he threw up on the rug. After spending an hour trying to clean it and having no success, I called SLO Steam and they made our rugs look and smell like new again. Another awesome job by SLO Steam!< /text></record></dataset><record>

I’ve had Slo Steam Carpet Cleaning at my house to clean my carpet and they do an amazing job! I have older style carpet but when Slo Steam comes round, it looks brand new. Will was on time and is very professional. His prices are awesome! I really enjoy a professional business and you will too!< /Review>

SLO Steam did a great job on our old carpet. We had some heavy traffic areas due to living in the same house for awhile. Setting up the appointment was easy. They asked if they could show up early which was nice. When they showed up they got to work right away and were very thorough and professional. And they honored their estimated price. I would definitely use them again.< /Text>

I was so happy with Slo Steam carpet cleaning, they did a terrific job and same day service. I called them because it rained and my kid tracked mud into the house. They understood my situation and arrived within an hour. Very professional and courteous. The set up they had in their van was first class.< /review>

Will and Edgar are the best! This is the second time I have used SLOSteam for carpet cleaning services. Our carpets were pretty bad after living in our former residence for 6 years. The guys had no issues removing annoying, gaudy stains. We will forever be customers!<//Review>

<Review>Super quick, friendly, professional, with competitive pricing (book in advance on their website for a little discount). The carpets haven’t looked that good since the day I moved in. And they are open sundays and available early!

<Text>Completely impressed! Our carpet looks brand new after having Slo Steam here. Our stairs were filthy and I was doubtful they could be cleaned very well but they look absolutely amazing and SO clean. Looks like brand new carpet! Our couch was also cleaned and I’m amazed that all the stains were removed. Will is professional and efficient. Can’t recommend Slo Steam highly enough!< /Text>< pictures>

as an Uber driver driving late at night, your going to get pukers, I did my best to clean up the mess that night, I proceeded to go pick up a rug doctor that next morning, after I picked it up I ran into Will and asked how much he would charge, we agreed on the price and he cleaned my back seat up right then and there, needless to say he did an awesome job I didn't need the rug doctor so I returned it while he was cleaning my car!

I bought a used car from a friend. I thought the interior was tan until SLO Steam Carpet Cleaning got in there to remove a cigarette odor...Turns out the interior is Gray!! Huge transformation!! (And no more odor) I could not be happier with the quality of work! Plus everything from scheduling to dry time was super fast. I have kids and I know there will be messes in the future...happy I know have a go-to for the next cleaning.< /review>

Will came by to steam our couch in March.
He did an amazing job and I meant to leave a review before COVID distracted me. The puppy stains all came out very nicely.  He had accidentally missed a spot and when I called him about it, he sincerely apologized calling me back right away, and came back that very afternoon to get that last spot behind the couch. I’ll be calling on SLO Steam carpet cleaning again for my carpets, when COVID has finally  lifted. Thanks again, Will!< /review>

Very easy to schedule and they arrived on time and even helped move some final pieces of large furniture that was in the way of the carpet needing to be done. After everything was done it looked like brand new carpet and everything smelled great and not full of nasty chemicals. Their estimate matched the final cost when I went to pay and overall a great service and company. I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good carpet cleaning and supporting small and local business.<//text>

First things first I don’t often write reviews at all unless things are amazing and need to be recognized or awful and need to be known. I’m absolutely thrilled with the work that Will (the owner) of SLO Steam Clean provided. I contacted him on a short notice and he was able to squeeze me into his schedule that same day. I had 3 bedrooms, 14 stairs, 1 landing, 1 area rug and this horrendous coffee stain that I got the day before in my car. Had a few specific stains I wasn’t sure if they were capable of being removed. One oddly enough being bubble gum and the other some sort of drink spill, both previously gone over by another steam cleaning business and unable to be removed. Will managed to get both major stains removed and make my carpets look amazing. I get my house steam cleaned annually and this job was far superior to others. Spoke to Will about his setup he had and how his machine is one of the leading units on the market right now. If you want the job done right, on time, and at a reasonable rate call slo steam clean. They are flat out amazing and very knowledgeable on what they do. Far more than just carpets too, they also do tile floors and automotive interiors!

Thanks again! You’ll definitely hear from me for future work.< /text>

I called SLO steam to clean my carpets for the holidays as I was having a bunch of family coming to town.
They were very professional and did an amazing job . They were on time and took extra time to work on a few spots that I had pointed out to them . The carpets came out like brand new.

They were on time and we were not ready to the time lot we committed to. They were easy and friendly to come back later to do the job that same day. Great service! Work around the costumers. And the carpet looks great! Love that they don’t have to see the place to quote you. Most companies require that and that is very uncomfortable process. Should be on sq footage the standard pricing. Like this company does. Overall great!! Thanks slo steam carpet cleaning!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I have off-white carpeting throughout my house that hasn't been professionally cleaned in many years. I decided to see what SLO Steam could do before I committed to replacing it all. They did a fantastic job with the carpet and conducted themselves in a very professional and courteous manner. Setting up the appointment was a breeze, and they managed to restore my carpet to nearly new condition. I should have had it professionally cleaned years ago! If you need your carpets cleaned, give these guys a try!< /Text>

Just had some tenants move out of our rental last week and we asked around to some of our friends if they had any recommendations.  One of my wifes close friends recommended Slo Steam carpet cleaning. We took their advice and loved loved loved how the carpets came out. The guy who came out I believe was the owner and he  took his time to make sure it came out clean for the next tenants. He actually said " I'm going to clean it as if I were moving into  this place." That's all I needed to hear. Great Job Slo Steam.< /Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Friday night we had a small get together at our new home. 20 plus friends came over to have beer and wine. Needless to say Saturday morning the house looked like a night after a Cinco de Mayo Cal poly party and smelled like the back of Slo Brew. The only carpet cleaning company that could accommodate us on a Saturday with same day service was Slo Steam Carpet Cleaning. They showed up with a very professional van and gave us a price and knocked  out the house in under 2 hours. Two very delightful  and professional employees were eager to please my wife and I down to the smallest details.
I would definitely recommend Slo Steam  carpet cleaning, they were fast, clean, affordable, and detailed orientated.</Review>< pics>

Last week my kid vomited all over our microfiber couch. Looked up carpet cleaning in San Luis Obispo and SLO Steam was one of the options. We gave them a shot and what great service and state of the art cleaning equipment. The owner took pride in his work and wanted to show us the money he invested in his rig. I was impressed. I’d highly recommend Slo Steam to all my friends and family.< /Review>

<text>Great customer service. SLO Steam actually came a few weeks before to clean our carpets. The stains came back and without hesitation the redid them for free and the stains did not return. They helped me remove stains from my carpet that we thought would never come out.

< Review>
Holy Cow carpet cleaning!!! Having a Christmas party tonight and an emergency situation happened with our 4 year old who woke up sick this morning. I called around to see if anyone could come over asap. Thankfully SLO Steam was able to come within 30 minutes of my call. I am so grateful and appreciative of their quick response and amazing work. Will the owner and his assistant were super professional and friendly. They were in and out in 45 minutes. Not only did they clean up the trail of “sick”, he cleaned the entire room for no extra charge and the connecting hallway!! I highly recommend SLO Steam for any type of cleaning!!<//Review>

Had a party at our house Friday night and Saturday morning noticed someone puked behind our couch. One of my friends recommended Slo Steam Carpet Cleaning. I only wanted them to clean the spot but they did the whole living room at a very special rate. Thanks Slo Steam!<//Text>

I am very pleased with the service I received from Heidi.  Compared to my previous visits from other skin care services purchased through groupon,  I'd say that my micro needling experience with Heidi has been the most satisfying.  A full face and neck service is a FULL face and neck.  She explained every steps, she was gentle, and I did not feel rushed.  I just had one session planned, but looking into other services Lavande Spa offers.  I will definitely be back.  Thank you.</Review>

<text>Nice spa, employees are nice & helpful. The only con I have is, the fact they have you put your personal belongings in a plastic bag, which I find useless, beyond wasteful with plastic, & not ideal for clients with expensive purses.

I'd consider returning, if they lifted this silly protocol. I have a pet peeve against companies wasting plastic & paper. It's a turn off, while everyone complains about global warming issues. Much better solutions.

Otherwise, the experience was 5 star.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1618605841377, 'text': "Hello Jenna, thank you for coming in and we appreciate the feedback.

The nurse practitioner, I feel bad that I cannot remember her name, but she was delightful, knowledgeable, and informative. She really put me at ease. The procedure went smoothly and painlessly, which was another concern of mine. I felt very safe because Lavande Spa has taken special care to ensure all clients are safe w/regard to Covid precautions.  I highly recommend this place and this treatment.

However, the pain was far worse I had communicated it hurt as she placed the laser back on my chin. I stated I did not want to proceed as she insured me that it was just a cold compress as she shocked my face again. I sat up and began to cry, asking if there was another alternative. The owner said that was all she was offering, an beauty was painful as she lacked any empathy. She tried to reassure me that IPL was used to treat hyperpigmentation and sun damage, yet the issue with my skin is SCARRING. WHAT TYPE OF NURSE OR TREATMENT PROVIDER IS SO CARELESS? I proceeded to say that I would like a refund and would leave a review if she was unwilling to fix the scaring they had created. She responded by saying she didn’t care and it would not affect her as she proceeded to stand in my face as she applied creams. I asked her to stop and to back up as I began to hysterically sob, resulting in her trying to hug me without even an apology for her attitude and lack of professionalism. I asked that she not do that, and she instructed me to “get out, leave. We will have the check for you to pick up”. THIS IS NOT HOW ANY ONE SHOULD BE TREATED WHEN THEY PAY FOR A LUXERY SERVICE. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO FUND THIS WOMANS BUSINESS OR ALLOW HER THE TIME TO TREAT ANYONE ELSE THE WAY SHE TREATED ME.< /Review>< Pictures>

My first experience at Lavande Spa was amazing. Ziba and her staff are the best of the best, and everybody made me feel welcomed and cared for in the best possible way. I had 2 CryoSculpt treatments done, 1 month apart, and I couldn't be happier with my decision to have it done at Lavande Spa. Everybody was so professional, kind and caring, and the follow up the next day was very much appreciated. I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back for more!</text>

I had filler done by Heidi.  She is absolutely amazing in her precision in its placement.  She did not make me look overdone but she did accomplish eliminating the nasty vertical lines around my lips.  Also, I typically bruise a lot but with her it was quite minimal.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HER.  In addition, the office personnel go above and beyond to make sure you're happy and that all your questions answered and needs met.<//text>

I am so please that Lavande Spa has opened here in north county.  The spa is beautiful and offers every skin care need.  The people are very nice and knowledgeable, and the procedure was quick.  I even became a Gold Star member because the value was so good.  I highly recommend Lavande Spa.</Review>

< review>
Absolutely amazing! I loved my experience even throughout these times with Covid where it’s difficult to feel relaxation at a spa with so many rules in place by the state.  They made me feel so comfortable but I was immediately impressed as soon as I walked in. It was such a gorgeous place there is some thing in there for anyone. And I’ve been dying to look for a place where I can get everything that I need to do in one please saves me the drive and I love it! definitely coming back for more.

I’ve been going to so many places with the lack of professionalism and customer service has died down or not cared for at all,  and it just Means so much now to find a place that was nice and inviting. Ziba the owner took care of most of my  treatments I didn’t even know I was going to get so many things done. That’s how comfortable I felt.

I am also letting my boyfriend know what to get me in the future for any gifting purposes! lol Valentine’s Day is around the corner I recommend any couple to go there! So happy!</review>

I loved how clean and beautiful the establishment is the staff super professional from the receptionist to the RN. I had a groupon and ended upgrading to more treatment after being educated on the process and benefits. All questions were answered and I ask a lot, lol. I had a little issue but was promptly resolved and was not necessarily their fault. Could have been numerous things including me not following post treatment instructions. I overreacted on the issue and feel horrible to no fault of theirs. They were sweet about it and even comp the touchup. Never have I experience such great customer service and sweetness from an establishment. I really appreacite everything they did. I will be scheduling my next procedure at Lavande as you cannot get service like theirs anywhere else.

Thank you LAVANDE!< /Text>

I LOVE 💘 LAVANDE SPA ALL THE STAFF ARE SUPER SWEET AND FRIENDLY THEY PROVIDE GENTLE AND CLEAR INFORMATION . I BECAME A MEMBER AND ITS THE BEST THING I HAVE INVESTED ON FOR MYSELF MY SKIN IS SMOOTH GETTING THEIR FACIALS  ,   I HIGHLY RECOMEND THEM. I USE TO GO TO LAZER AWAY AND CHANGED DUE TO HIGH PRICING AND THEY PRESSURE THEIR CLIENTS TO SPEND MORE.  LAVANDE SPA IS THE BEST!!!!!</Review>

It was my first visit at Lavande Spa which has a very welcoming environment. I was in the hands of a skilled injector, Ziba, and my results are natural looking. I definitely recommend Lavande Spa.
Happy customer!<//Review>

I found this little treasure through Groupon. They honored the Groupon promotional price (I learned a while ago merchants don’t get much of the purchase from Groupon). I went in for Dysport, then decided to go with the Xeomin instead after additional education and research. During COVID, only two guests will be in the reception area at a time. Lavande is a beautiful Med Spa, very soothing. The receptionists are knowledgeable about the services as they have received a number of treatments themselves (if that’s a perk, I might try to join the team!! 😆). I’m looking forward to treating myself to other treatments in the near and foreseeable future.<//Review>

My normal spots did not open back up. So, I took a chance on a new place. I am so glad I did. The facility is very nice. The staff was friendly. They did a health screening to ensure safety measures were met for protection. The appointment did not feel rushed. All the little things (but important) were addressed and handled professionally. I highly recommend! I am going back for a hydrafacial in 2 weeks.<//Text><Name>April Henley< /Name><Date>1593206703012</Date><Response>{'time': 1593258606452, 'text': 'This makes us so happy to hear.

Lavande Spa is a beautiful facility! I was greeted by Isabella and Mondona who were both so warm and welcoming. I am so happy with the results of my treatment with Ziba. I would highly recommend Lavande Spa and can't wait to go back for additional treatments!< /Review>

<text>This is a hidden gem.
Came here on a Saturday at around 8pm and there were many tables open.

Heads up: 2 order minimum for the grill. Also comes with your choice of soybean paste soup, kimchi soup or bean paste in hot pot for ($4.99 extra). We got the soybean paste soup and it's definitely one of the tastiest dwenjangjiggaes I've ever had. The server told us it is made ready to order (not pre cooked) and that it tastes almost like the Korean countryside. He was right! They also had a variety of banchans ranging from kimchi, picked jalapeño, cucumber kimchi, pickled radish, a pickled onion salad, soybean sprouts and more.

Marinated short rib (28.99): the quality of the meat is 5 stars but I would say the marinade is 4 stars. I've definitely had better galbi marinades at other places. It was not as sweet and flavorful as I usually like. However, the amazing meat quality more than made up for it.

Rib finger (25.99): This was the star of the show. I normally don't like non-marinated meats when I go to kbbq places because the quality is not very good. However, the finger rib here was hands down one of the most tender, juicy and flavorful meats I've ever had. The quality of this meat was AMAZING. You must order this if you go.

The service was also amazing. Our server was very attentive, changed our grill multiple times, checked up on us often, made recommendations.

We will definitely be back! This place is comparable to the high quality ayce bbqs in Koreatown, LA but at a fraction of the price and wait.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNstDECmGnK5xnfX2gtWgNNkT8UF_hQflYmkHHz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFtZMo-SXWyYAUX2hO44zlOpU60thJ2ByrEqdI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLZIuFnOGsV96YsQIzaPYFIRfgNjZgKsdmWWPx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgBllQaJWt90J9Ko3MG5vHfl9NtcU7HVnHKOI2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4isdQX6bVxIn-bjKUZ8rPV61CdFbhCgCd_KXd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCcplb_zrv-kl-iIifQ1DdxVM-iJQIAxGWFimp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhEDdf23h2-egYcYYNQqWbkmYvwwAYvQ1MNEWk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSqyy3hUDWwKwO4n-MAM0HgyGWKs0qMDz7JVNI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNM5fhHmHDhZtWrXFfM9lfdEyzF0puB_cdzXpss=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhBY0A6yNSAEv88Yh4wYwwOBQzCrM1kmAJzNsd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCo_ztpJbyI8PL-X0A3BxJ6eLU-BD6Gtw8XfQa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVcotTyJZad13sp_P9A-ZWLeHVevrrdQH_9qhK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMciNm-up4HCk8Bb7VAhYPjisfmiErDOkKHvbqL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3u8VrY5ozGw__6HegOrqbxtCGyT0iQ47Tgm3r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9asZLafPm2RGlGjCJidbvrNBUTdDKofObBn0v=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOh6zYmoLX7h7S4br6WH3BQR5btl0QrTLvLXDyT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7JdXJjgvZZMvJkcZYdEv6ZfDbbo2XP8ZLUHQI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYokTzndksgB6xyEjoYP-5lurKIJxXrlHBEiXj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeq0QmDQb1rZH1sdnaadoEZyXp3juNenYMpQCU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5YQV248FUZ9OaTaYYM83lntDyG-93KwN-clpX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEGRtuuewRMRwpxPSkNYA5-ulCmbIQYO0cFM36=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures></record></dataset><record>

A couple of things you need to know if you want to visit here: First, the menu is in Korean, and is not available in English. Communication with the servers is difficult if you do not speak Korean. The picture on the menu is a bit misleading. It shows a large plate full of meat next to the price of an individual entree, but is probably a picture of three or four entrees. Second, this place is a bit pricey for a hole in the wall strip mall in Stanton. The entrees for Korean BBQ were about $26 per person. The food was good, but not anything that I found super impressive.<//Text>

Very good quality meat, banchan, and SERVICE. This place is an authentic Korean restaurant if you want to experience how original Korean food and cultural vibe feel. I definitely recommend any beef cut outs you like and with some samkyumsal to finish with finesse taste with their home-made bean paste (gotta try it). I come here every so often and I continuely will with my family and friends, whatever others say this place is a must try if you are sick of getting fed by bad meat in AYCE. Oh and I forgot to mention their "Kalguksoo" is racked with mastery, one of the top 3 best in town.< /Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Great place for korean barbeque!
The ribs are delicious and the giblets are delicious. It is well ventilated and doesn't smell. Kalguksu and naengmyeon were also good. Family gatherings are always here. Both parents and kids like it. Price is reasonable, too. Especially those who work, please be kind and good like family. It is recommended.

Great place for korean barbeque!
갈비도 맛있고 곱창도 맛있네요. 환기도 잘되서 냄새도 안나는 편. 칼국수랑 냉면도 상당히 좋았어요. 가족들 모임은 항상 여기서 하기로 했어요. 부모님들도 애들도 다 좋아하네요. 가격도 적당하고. 특히 일하시는 분들이 가족처럼 친절하고 잘해주세요. 강추합니다.<//text><Resp>None<//Resp>< rate>

<Review>Absolutely terrible service, so very rude & we each got a different person! Quality came out semi good for only 1 of the 3!!! Absolutely outrageous prices when we got NOTHING we wanted... definitely will never waste my money on this business again! (Must say we only got the gentlemen & I’ve heard really good things about Tina, although I am never willing to go back) alsoooo they had booked 4 ladies for a 11:30 appointment and the whole time they were taking walk-ins... wouldn’t suggest making an appointment, you’ll only wait longer....< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
I called to make an appointment asked if they had availability for a full set the lady was extremely rude she asked how can I help you as soon as I started to ask she cuts me off saying can you let me talk.  I will not be using your services if I could give NO stars I would.</Review>

There was a bit of a wait but that was expected for the time and day I went. Most other places were closed. My Tech was quiet and professional. I was pleased with my nails although the shape wasn’t exactly what I wanted. I wanted square with rounded edges but got square. The polish was applied nice and evenly. I got a gel set in red stone. I’ll be back in two weeks and make sure they get the shape right.</text>

<review>I am not sure why there are so many negative reviews here...I have been to many of the nail shops in town and this is by far the best experience I have had. The nail tech listened to exactly what I wanted, my nails were even and completely covered, no bubbles or bumps, and when she realized they didn't have the color I was looking for, she found a way to make something else work beautifully! All with my approval of course. My nails are beautifully done - gel polish - and they were gentle, welcoming, and I waited maybe 5 minutes, at maximum. I highly recommend Tammy's Nails.</review>< Time>

This was the WORST experience in my entire 37 years of pedicures. First off the staff was EXTREMELY rude!!
I highly doubt any of them could call themselves US licensed nail techs. The gel was the worst I've seen and when I asked for a design they did not even ask me what design I wanted and it was done poorly to say the least. $50 latter just for them to DOUBLE swipe and DOUBLE charge my card. My little boy and I went back in to have the money returned back on the card which our bank suggested we do. I walked in on the phone with my bank and stood in the lobby arguing with them for OVER a hour. The lady from my bank was kind enough to stay on the phone with me throughout the entire horrible ordeal. Thank God for her.
We ended up walking out disputing both charges for services denied. If you do have to go here for nails I suggest you DO NOT use your credit or debit card. This is nothing new for them and they will tell you the charge is "pending" and will be returned in seven days.
It was the WORST experience as a small business owner myself customer satisfaction is important and I was shocked as was the bank by the way they handled this.< /Text>

My wife went and got a pedicure here and from the very beginning every person working were rude, disrespectful and the guy working behind the counter had the poorest customer service skills ( if you call it working he spent most of his time  on his cell phone)
Now here is the kicker: when we went to pay the swiped the card and credit card machine was out of paper so instead of putting new paper in machine and hitting continue the put paper in machine and swiped card again now I have 2 charges of $45 a piece on my account. I got charged $90 for a pedicure! When I looked at my account and saw it I went back and asked them to remove one of the charges. They told me one of the charges is pre authorization and will drop off even both charges had 2 different authorization numbers. The called their merchant and we called our bank to figure out what is going on. Their merchant who could barley speak English was rude and when my banker was explaining that card was charged twice. They kept saying we and my banker was lying. Their merchant hung up and they would not refund one of the charges. It got to the point where my banker was getting upset with them. They are shady, rude, and dis respectful to customers (especialy their American Customers) Do Not Go To Tammy Nails! Save your money, time, and hassle. They are crooks and rude to all their customers and if you use your card check your account to see what they actually are charging you.<//Text>

Unfortunetly today I had to work with an older gentalmen he was nice and funny but the quality of my set is god awful. I asked for coffin I ended up with almond square and idk what the hell to call the other messed up one but needless to say I am very unhappy.<//Review>

They do not listen. I said no polish, he put on a clear coat, I asked to have my nails evened up, he cut them all completely off and they had at least a quarter of an inch on the shortest ones. After I was visibly upset he then asked if he should do the other hand. I am visually impaired and could not see/tell what was done until it was too late. Never again.</Text>

Nikki does a great job but making an appointment doesn't matter, I always wait at least 30 minutes from my appointment time. My time is just as important,  I am looking for a new shop!!</Text>

<review>This place was great years ago when Tammy owned it, but since she sold over 7 years ago, the place is bad.  They take walk ins over scheduled appointments.  They do acrylic so thin that the tips of my nails were constantly chipping off.  I would constantly go back for repairs.  I left Tammys after being treated as if my business didn't matter and after I was sick of constantly going back.  I would not recommend this nail salon.< /review>< pictures>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Text>Without realizing, while the man was drilling my nail to put the acrylic on he did it too much and my nail cracked in the middle. This was about a month ago but my nails are about to come off and I noticed I had excruciating pain on the one nail while I was working. My nails were SO PRETTY THOUGH! The man also seemed VERY tired and distracted while he was drilling on my nails. I know this review is all over the place but my visit there was too lol.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x54d2eca38b3997c5:0x74ce7f1f02ba2189<//GmapID></record>

I had an appt that wasn't honored. They overbooked and asked me to come back 45 min later. I had already been waiting 10 min before another lady came in. Not sure why her appt was honored over mine when I was there 1st. Will be seeking a new nail salon<//Review>

<review>This oasis for men was much needed! Great atmosphere, very comfortable. Private televisions for each chair with headphones, complimentary beverages and a staff who know exactly what they are doing. This is the best place for a man to get a manicure and pedicure. I'll definitely be telling all my male friends about this place.< /review><name>LaVeL DeLone</name></record></dataset><record>

Got mani pedi set with my bf for Valentine's Day and didn't expect much as I know they do nails for men. This place prides itself on amenities: alcoholic beverage, sparkling water, etc. Large comfy seat and 1:1 ratio flat screen TV that you can even get headphones and a remote for while your services are rendered.

While the experience was nice, the mani/pedi left much to be desired. I think it's a nice gift idea because of the amenities, but we won't be back anytime soon for the services.</text>

<text>The young lady who helped me was very nice and pleasant. The issue I have is, you guys charged me $75 for a lineup!! The whole process took about 20 mins. That was a huge overcharge for something that should be fairly simple. I don’t think I will be utilizing your services any longer.< /text><Name>E J Hawkins<//Name>< Time>

<Review>Love this place! Always great to walk into a place and be greeted by your name and with a friendly smile. When someone makes you feel like you're not just another guy, but more like you're THE guy getting a haircut or something to take care of yourself, it feels great. Then you match that with a great cut or a relaxing pedicure where you know you are the main priority to this person, where making you comfortable and taking care of you is their goal. The Manager Mia is fantastic! Always willing to answer any questions to make sure you get the best out of each visit. All around, I think this is definitely worth every penny and then sum.< /Review>< Pictures>

Pretty sure my son is their only kid client. The crew here always remembers us and are so welcoming. They do a great job giving him chill some dude time and a nice cut. Pedicures here are also awesome! They don't do color, which is fine with us- just get your skin soft and nails maintained.< /Review>

My first experience at Hammer and Nails was PHENOMENAL. The entire staff was warm, welcoming and charismatic. From the point I was greeted by Joe at the front desk, I knew that everyone truly values the client experience. My  aesthetician, "T", was amazing. She was hilarious, professional, thorough and took great care of me. I am definitely going to go back to H&N. I highly recommend this spot to everyone.</review>

Breanna was awesome! Very professional and followed all guidelines for CDC recommendations to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Which made me feel comfortable enough to come back. Everyone was wearing a mask and used gloves the entire session. I will be coming back again soon.<//review>

<rating>3</rating><review>Great concept! Positives: I was offered a drink as soon as I checked in and the lady that cut my hair was very nice. Issues: They were 20 minutes late in getting to me. I don't think my barber had much experience in cutting African-American hair, which I knew might happen, but I figured I would give it a shot. I asked for a bald fade on the sides and back and a trim on the top. She did her best though. I also did not get a shampoo, condition, or scalp massage, so I feel like I paid a lot for a glass of scotch!</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1570210680700, 'text': 'We always strive for a five star experience.

< Review>
My husband got the one-hour pedicure/foot treatment. He has a problem with ingrown toenails so he was afraid of someone touching his toes.  The women who took care of him was extremely gentle but also very effective. He was super happy.  Also, having a place for a guy to get his nails done is brilliant.</Review>

Had a 90 min mani-pedi and thoroughly enjoyed it. The salon is super clean and the staff friendly and super professional. The work completed was excellent and I enjoyed being able to watch TV with headphones or just relax. Wound up signing up for the membership as it worked out to be a good deal and saved me 20% on the services I got that day.< /Review>

<text>I got a gift card from wifey to check this spot out. I loved the whole experience. My appointment was at 10 am on a Saturday morning. The check-in was smooth. They offered a beverage with my service and I don't normally partake that early in morning, but I wanted the whole experience. So, I got my Makers Mark on the rocks. I sat in a comfy chair, turned on the some college basketball, and proceeded to get an outstanding manicure and pedicure from Mila while sipping the MM.

Can't wait to go back!< /text><Response>{'time': 1579807865144, 'text': 'Great to hear you were pleased Robert!'}<//Response></record>

<text>I sent my boyfriend to “ Hammer and Nails” as just a little something to help him relax. Mind this is a “manly man” so mani-pedi is something is does not do! None the less he enjoyed it. He said he felt like a “King” which made me super happy cause I treat him like one. I set up the appointment online and called the day before to ensure to use my card on file so he didn’t have to pay for anything and my instructions were followed through. He’s so impressed he’s thinking about becoming a member now! Thank you “Hammer and Nails” for such incredible service; and it had to be just that for this man not to complain because he critiques EVERYTHING!< /text>< Name>

I loved the set up...the hands and feet room with the TVs is very cool...
The pedicure seemed ok but I was not really paying attention cuz I was watching the football game...
But when I went home I was able to take a look at the job that was done and it looked like she was not quite finished...
Then I got a "clean" up...other wise known as a lime up... she asked if I wanted a straight line or rounded and I said "can you blend it out please " she then said "a fade"...I said yes... funny thing is it seems as though she did not know what either one of those are cuz I got neither and when I got home I had to line myself up correctly...there was hair all around my ears....
This place has a lot of potential...the customer service when I got there was nice...
The gentleman who booked my appointment was extremely distracted talking to other people while I am trying to book my " first time experience "

I apologize if this sounds harsh but I have worked in the service industry almost all my life...people pay for an experience and the service itself...

I hope this place picks it up and does better...
Best of luck</Text>

They treat you like a King. Sometimes men need to groom and apply self care as well, if you have no clue this place will enlighten you 100%.< /review>

<time>1563120961600< /time><Text>I booked the appointment as a surprise for my boyfriend - the nail tech, service, and environment were all incredible. The decor and amenities were perfect and really made for a great experience for him.

Minus one star because when I called to book the appointment, I asked how much a manicure AND pedicure would be and the guy told me it would be $40. Ok, cool. Once we got there, I learned it was $40 for each service - so $80 plus tip. That's fine; I realize this is a luxury experience and service. I just wish the person I spoke with had been more clear so I could have known ahead of time that I'd be spending $100 rather than $50 once we got there.<//Text><user_id>107369534107837160919<//user_id><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmap_id>

The service is incomparable.
The ambiance perfectly relaxing.

The shop manager called me an hour before my appointment to let me know that Tahni was running 10 minutes behind schedule.

Tahni is a fantastic manicurist/pedicurist/conversationalist, who informed me on my last visit that the shop now offers brow, ear, and nose waxing as well which I look forward to experiencing on my next visit.</Review>

My husband went for his birthday and he was very impressed. He loved his jack & hammer service and liked his nail tech. The team at Hammer & Nails were very helpful and even when his phone died they assisted him in getting ahold of me for pick up. He felt very polished and ready for his travels to Hong Kong. We will for sure book again soon!</text>

First time ever getting a manicure or pedicure. I told them that and they were very welcoming.  The entire staff was very friendly and the whole experience was very relaxing. I walk a lot all day every day and work with my hands a lot.  My hands and feet feel really good after my experience and I'm looking forward to going back again!< /Review>

Where do the guys go to get their nails groomed? Hammer and Nails! From the moment that you walk through the door you quickly settle into nirvana.

From the excellent service provided by a world class staff to the ambiance and decor it's a challenge to get back to the real world.< /review>

Dr. Redford is an excellent orthodontist! He's kind and cares for u. The office is well kept and clean. The staff Is helpful and kind as well. I highly recommend this office! They're efficient and well educated in what they do. There was no pain during the process.  No delays in any part of the process. I will bring my other child here for braces!< /text>

Just got Madyson’s braces off today, and her smile is absolutely perfect!  We absolutely love Dr. Burke & Dr. Redford and all their staff! We were impressed with them from day 1!  They do such a great job of explaining everything and are super friendly!  Mom and both girls are patients and are loving the results so far!  One done, two more to complete!< /text>

I originally saw Dr Burke 22yrs ago. His bedside manner and attention to detail had me coming back 18yrs later. Dr Redford is an excellent addition to the practice and I appreciate his help. I finally had braces put on as an adult and had full upper and lower jaw surgery. Everyone in the office was extremely supportive, even with COVID extending the process by over a year. Morris is a SAINT for putting up with my extremely sensitive mouth every 6weeks for two full years. That man deserves a raise!</Text>

Amazing orthodontist! The entire office staff, orthodontic assistants, and the Dr’s are the BEST! They care about each patient and always have a plan in action that best fits the needs of that patient. I have 4 kiddos that have gone through their doors and each one of them have have always had great experiences. Never a fear of pain! Thank you Dr. Burke and Dr. Redford!<//text>

I had came for braces treatment and my smile never looked better! The talented work of Dr. Burke & Redford is phenomenal and would recommend to everyone. The location is perfect for students as it is walking/short driving distances from many schools. Every visit was a professional delight. Strongly recommend.<//Review>

<review>The best place that anyone and everyone should go to for orthodontic care. The staff are the nicest and sweetest people you’ll see around. I spent 4 1/2 years before my braces came off and every time I’d go I was elated due to the fact I knew I was going to have some awesome conversations with some of the most friendly people and I’d have the best care around. A truly amazing place to go and I wouldn’t recommend anywhere else!<//review>< pics>

They’re always nice and amazing. Only had braces for almost 3 years and i love my results! They get things done quick and make sure it’s accurate in every session. This is the best orthodontist place ever! It is deaf friendly, they wear their mask all day but will have me read their lips to understand what’s going on. It’s very welcoming here as well and I love that!

PS...Jo is the best!!! :)< /text>

What an amazing office Dr Burke and Dr Redford have! I have an extremely difficult case that requires oral surgery. Dr Burke put me right at ease and I can’t wait to get started with the process. Ashley and Dixie have been so helpful and kind and have made this whole experience so easy. I highly recommend them!<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Burke and Redford Orthodontics have been wonderful to work with! After bringing 3 of my children here for orthodontic care, I decided it was my turn to have my teeth fixed. I got Invisalign and could not be happier with my results! Dr. Burke and Dr. Redford are meticulous in their work. All of the office staff is well-trained, knowledgeable and professional. Everyone in the office is friendly and very pleasant to work with. I have one more child and a husband who will starting their orthodontic treatment soon, as well. These guys are the best!!! Thank you, Burke and Redford Orthodontics, for making our smiles beautiful!<//Review>< Pictures>

Both my kids have seen Dr Burke and Dr Redford!  They are amazing and they care!  You can’t get a better staff than who they have working with the kids and the parents!  They are honest and trustworthy and when you want to play a practical joke on your kid for April Fools Day the entire staff will get involved (heehee) no questions asked!  If you are looking for a referral from someone who has gone through it with 2 kids ,I, 100% would refer you to Dr Burke and Dr Redford</text>

Dr. Burke and Dr. Redford are top notch and their staff are outstanding too. I've had 2 go through their more than capable hands and they have healthy teeth and  beautiful smiles as proof. I have recommended and will continue to recommend them; they are truly the very best.< /Text>

My daughter is special needs and I wasn't sure how she would react to the whole orthodontic experience.  The first few visits, she took medication to relax.  We very quickly came to realize this was not needed.  Dr. Burke, Dr. Redford and the whole staff put my daughter at ease, worked at her pace and put her needs first.  They went above and beyond in accommodating us with the best appointment times and making my daughter's favorite staff member available for her appointments.  Her teeth look fabulous.  I LOVE to see her smile!!  I highly recommend Burke & Redford Orthodontists to everyone!!  I thank them so much for making our orthodontist experience a positive one.< /text>

It was a great experience from the initial consultation to the end of the orthodontics treatment. Staff is very kind, go above and beyond to make sure my daughter is doing well, they recognize you when you come in, the dr even called me after hours to check on my daughter because she was having gum inflammation which I thought was a nice gesture and they work with your schedule.
Personally having braces twice myself, my experience with my daughter having braces and her teeth looking great, I would say This office surpassed my expectations.< /text><rating>5<//rating>< response>

From the first consultation Dr. Redford and his qualified team have been very pleasant to work with. At each step of the process he gave thorough updates on the progress of our teeth and what to expect next. We always felt comfortable with Dr. Redford working on our teeth because of his welcoming persona, impressive experience and prior results.

We choose to travel from San Diego to Temecula for Dr. Redford's orthodontic services as we had heard from family and friends his work was the best around, bar none. He did not let their recommendation down, as we are very happy we made the decision to commute so he could work on our teeth.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>Burke and Redford Orthodontists is truly one of a kind. Every time I walk in, I am greeted with familiar faces, and treated like family. Dr. Burke and Dr. Redford always take the time to assess your unique situation. They truly care about the progress your making and taking the extra time to make everything perfect. I had braces with them and I loved the process, now I love my teeth. Even when my retainer had been damaged, I came in and they gave me two new ones, free of charge. I would definitely recommend anyone to go there if they are looking for an orthodontist.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I’ve had 2 of my kids go through their office with amazing results. They are also very open and honest about the solutions they suggest. They could very easily have recommended a solution for my daughter that wiould have cost mire but said, “we could do option A but I think it’s going to cost you mire in the end. You might be better going with option B which will cost you less and ultimately have the same result.”  Great service and great at what they do.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Gmap_id>0x80db7e40ca46ec13:0x7856313fca97096f</Gmap_id></record>

I highly recommend seeing Dr. Redford for your orthodontic care! Not only is he extremely qualified and knowledgeable, but he makes you feel welcome and comfortable upon each visit. Him and his team are very efficient and a pleasure to work with!

As an adult, I was hesitant about the thought of getting braces again. I knew if I committed to doing it, it would have to be from the best! When I had found Burke & Redford Orthodontics, I knew that commuting from San Diego to Temecula would be worth it, and they have continued to far exceed my expectations.</Text>

Great ortho!  Staff and doctors are very informative and friendly.  They are flexible with scheduling appointments and get you right in for any unexpected issues that may arise. It is a long term relationship, especially if you have multiple children needing braces and we couldn’t be happier!</Text>

I was so fortunate to have landed in the exceptional care of Dr. Burke, Dr. Redford & Staff. They are so welcoming, friendly & personal. It was the most enjoyable experience.
The accommodation they provided me for my daughters wedding was amazing & so appreciated so that I could have a better smile while in braces.
You are in for a treat choosing this incredible team!</review>

Amazing experience with Burke and Redford. My brother and I have been going to them for years. And over the past 8 years everyone has been so kind and helpful and have done amazing work on our teeth. Highly recommend to anyone in search of an orthodontist. Thank you so much!< /Review>

<review>I was a patient at Dr. Burke’s office about 20 years ago.  Back then his office was always warm,fun, and friendly. I never forgot how much I enjoyed my visits.  Dr. Burke was always upbeat and attentive and surprisingly funny. He always remembered our conversations from the previous visits and always made you feel important.  That’s why when it came time for my own kids to start braces, there was no other choice for us but Dr. Burke and Redford. Dr. Burke is still as sweet as ever and so is his associate Dr. Redford. The office staff is always amazing, very helpful, and always informative.  I’m so glad I met Dr Burke so many years ago. Both my kids love their orthodontists and their results just as I did.  Thank you so so much Dr. Burke, Redford, and Staff for all you do! 😁

<text>Dr. Burke and Redford’s practice is great! From the front office staff, to all of the assistants, and of course the doctors, it was a superior experience from beginning to end. I was treated professionally with kindness and concern every step of the way. Over time I felt like I was being cared for by friends. They have created a very special atmosphere in their office. I wholeheartedly recommend you consider them for your orthodontial needs.</text>< pics>

<Name>Julieann Cantrell<//Name><Text>Myself and 2 kids have been seeing Dr. Burke for several years in the Temecula location.  He is a very hardworking and fabulous orthodontist.  He provides the best and honest form of treatment plan.  He discusses options, if available.  Dr. Redford came to practice a few years into our orthodontic regimen.  He is very efficient and makes the practice even more strong as an office.  The staff has a genuine interest in each of us as individuals.  They ask about our family latest travels, schooling and work.  They all work diligently to meet our needs when they arise.  I mean 24/7.  You call, they answer.  If you need an excellent and fun-loving orthodontist office, welcome aboard.<//Text>< Pictures>

Dr. Burke, Dr. Redford and staff are absolutely wonderful. They are prompt in the service; happy, pleasant, and very professional in their actions; and most of all, they make you feel comfortable. They listen to your concerns and work with you. From the very beginning, I have had nothing but positive experiences.
Thank you Dr. Burke, Dr. Redford and staff for a beautiful smile! I highly recommend Burke & Redford Orthodontists!</text>

<Review>Both my grandchildren have gone to Dr. Burke for their braces!  My granddaughter got hers off six months ago and my grandson is getting his off this month!  They are both in middle school and so many of their friends also go to Dr. Burke! I am posting this because I have been so impressed from start to finish in the treatment they both have received from Dr. Burke and his amazing staff. Dr. Burke’s work is impeccable, professional and the very best. He and his staff truly care about their patients.  They are so great in encouraging these kids to follow Dr. Burke’s instructions in taking care of their braces and the kids really like and respect them!  Both of my grandchildren’s teeth look amazing!  I would highly recommend Dr. Burke to anyone who not only wants excellent results but an orthodontist whose work is outstanding!  Lastly, he gets such great results because he these kids really like and trust him and do what they are suppose to do!</Review>< Pics>

We have been going to Dr. Burke since 2000. I have children who range from 12-29. All three have had braces (youngest got his removed today).  Their teeth are PERFECT.  The majority of the staff have remained with Dr. Burke for the last 19 years.  That is amazing to me and a testimony in itself.  The staff has always been incredibly nice and professional and bend over backwards to accommodate your schedule.  I would give ten stars if that was an option.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

A few months ago I had my wisdom teeth taken out from this location. The staff is very professional and very friendly. I was exceptionally nervous and they put me very at ease. Not to mention Dr. Burke himself as he is wonderful. The results of the surgery were very positive and they handled our insurance amazingly. Excellent job all around and despite it being a surgery it was as pleasant an experience as it could be. I highly recommend them.<//Review>

All three of my kids have been patients of Dr. Burke and Dr. Redford. From palate expanders to braces, we have been in their offices for years. They have worked wonders on the challenging positions of each child’s jaw and my first child has also completed braces ending with a beautiful smile! Their offices are clean, staff is friendly, professional and kind. They treat you like family.</Text>

The drive from Corona to Temecula over the last few years was so worth the excellent care I received!
I can’t say enough about how they make you feel like you are their #1 priority. I’m beyond happy with my new smile!!

I am now 15 years old and I have had an outstanding experience with Dr. Burke and Redford Orthodontists! I just recently got my braces off and my teeth look perfect, and I get so many compliments on them! I love the staff and experience from the office and I would recommend them to anyone! We drive 45 minutes for every appointment to come to Dr. Burke and Dr. Redford.< /Review>

We’ve had a great experience here from beginning to end!  The doctors and staff are efficient and happy and welcoming.  They are very accommodating for appointment times.  I love that they send out text reminders for upcoming appointments to forgetful busy working moms like me!</Review>

In short, Burke & Redford Orthodontists changed my life. The staff are professionals, the offices are clean and I can't recommend them enough. In my adolescence, I went to countless consultations with various orthodontists, all of which considered my case severe, many of which recommended either surgery, tooth extractions, or both. Dr. Burke was the exception, his recommended approach was the least invasive and I couldn't be happier with the results.

I wore braces for four years throughout highschool, enduring both a palatal expander and a device known as a herbst appliance, it was a challenge but worth the payoff. At nearly every visit Dr. Burke was excited to see my results, you can really tell he is passionate about his work. Although it has been over a decade since I started my teeth straightening journey, there are many moments I still have immense gratitude.

Thank you Dr. Burke, Zabrina, Liz and everyone else at Burke & Redford Orthodontists, you've changed my life for the better.
(As a side note, my orthodontic treatment was done before Burke and Redford started their partnership, but the high quality of their work remains the same.)</Review>

Dr. Burke and Dr Redford are both great. Very caring and love their patients. Assistants and staff are all very nice and welcoming.
They have been prepping my child pre braces for two years and now she finally  got her braces on. Done very efficiently and so far so good. Answer all our questions and we feel we are in great hands!
Thank you!<//Review>

Dr. Burke and his staff are extremely professional. They help ease the "fear" of braces. The office is very organized and runs very smoothly.. Never leaving us to have to wait long.
Dr. Burke truly shows interest in all of his patients and genuinely cares. We would recommend Dr. Burke to everyone!<//Review>

<Text>Dr. Burke and his staff are extremely wonderful.  There is a reason he is one of the best, most busy orthodontists in the Temecula Valley.  I have 3 children in braces right now and am very pleased with the care they receive.  Dr. Burke and his staff are all very friendly with the kids, and they are very comfortable going to see him.  Appointments seem quick and easy, and Dr. Burke always puts a personal spin on the appointment by sitting and talking with the kids as well as parents.  This office is highly recommended.</Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

I think Dr. Burke is the best! We are on our second child in braces here and have had nothing but a great experience! When we first considered braces with our oldest, we went to 4 different offices for consultations. Dr. Burke was by far the most thorough and gave us 4 scenarios ranging from most to least aggressive treatments. I loved this because it gave us a lot of insight to how we should proceed. My daugter’s smile is amazing!! Looking forward to my second child’s results.  Highly recommend this office!

**Updated- 2nd child just got her braces off...amazing results as expected!! We had the pleasure of seeing Dr. Redford for most of her 2.5 years in braces. He had big shoes to fill after only having Dr. Burke the first child. I must say, he was amazing! Just as amazing results as we had with our oldest. Highly recommend this office and staff!!< /review>

When looking for an orthodontist there was one name that each Mom I asked named, Dr Burke! Both of my children have gone to him and we now know why his is the name you hear recommended most.  The care of the patients and the communication to the parents is wonderful. Getting the text reminders of appointments has saved us from missing an appointment more than once. :) We highly recommend Dr. Burke!<//review>

<review>Dr.Burke is an amazing orthodontist. We checked out 4 other orthodontists before deciding on him and the choice was obvious. He treats his patients like he would treat his own children or family. The staff and office is amazing. He is very clear with what he will be doing and how to take care of what you will have in your mouth. I've reccomended multiple friends to him. I am so glad I chose Dr.Burke. Thank you!< /review>< pictures>

Dr Burke and Dr Redford are both great. They take lots of time with my boys and personally talk to me after each appointment. The entire staff is excellent and I highly recommend them.</review>

Dr. Burke and the staff are AMAZING!!  I've had 2 kids finish braces and 2 more to go and the results are the best!  Being a dental hygienist , I looked around until I found Dr. Burke.  Very clean and professional office.  I refer my friends to Dr. Burkes office and they have been thrilled with the quality of his work.  I was impressed with how respectful they were with my time and how we never had long waits during the kids appointments.< /review>

I researched multiple orthodontists when we realized my son needed braces. I found that Dr. Burke has great reviews from patients and is highly regarded by his peers as well.

Once I made the decision, I told the other orthodontists that we had consulted with we had selected Dr Burke and they had nothing but nice things to say about him.

A year has passed dice then and I couldn't be more satisfied with my son's ortho care. Dr. Burke and his staff are wonderful!! I'm so very thankful we found them! Exceptional care and service!!</review>

Couldn’t reccomend their office more- they are all wonderful... they even remember my kids names, husband’s name, always remember what’s going on at home- which is amazing since they see so many patients.

Can not say enough good things. He is very understanding of kids who are afraid and all ways take the time to make them feel ok. Their pay structure is flat. So you know how much it is going to be and do not feel like he is adding things to pad the bill because it is all ready included</text>

<text>Dr. Burke and his staff are caring and provide the best professional orthodonic care in the valley !
We heard about Dr. Burke from my sister who had all three of her girls get braces done by Dr. Burke and ended up with beautiful smiles. Our two children ended up with the same results; and they were very patient with my son's sports injuries to his braces.  As a healthcare provider myself, I am keenly aware of honest, professional care; Dr. Burke is a thorough, patient, and only wants the best end result for his patients. Thank you very much for your care.< /text>< pictures>

< Review>
Dr. Burke was my orthodontist for 3 years. While I was in treatment, the staff was so friendly and helpful. Aileen, Liz and Johanna always made each visit (which could be scary with my fear of the dentist chair) very welcoming and comfortable. The receptionist, Zabrina, always made sure my appointments were scheduled and made each visit something to look forward to. She even remembered what was going on in my life and asked me about my family (knowing their names even!) each visit. The office, waiting area and restroom was always very clean and very organized. Dixie handled my payments, which were priced very fairly. And last but definitely not least, Dr. Burke was always so wonderful. You can definitely tell his main concern is making your smile beautiful the right way! He is always in such a wonderful mood and always seems so excited to see you! Whether it's his whistling while he works or cheery disposition, Dr. Burke is doing something right. The office even raffles off prizes (it was a new iPod when I was there) for great brushing! They also have an Xbox gaming system to keep your kiddos occupied and a fish tank that adds so much more life (if that's possible) to the office. My braces were removed 7 years ago and, with the help of this amazing staff, my teeth are still straight! I highly suggest going to Dr. Burke's office to get that beautiful smile you've always wanted as well as an awesome experience!</Review>

I had a great experience from start to end. I was in the front for a few minutes. So the guy in the front desk said come on back, I'll help you. Everyone else must be busy. Can't remember your name, sorry. He was right about there house prerolls. It does have a punch. The girl was right. I should have switched prerolls. LOL! Good times guys and I will be back. I'll bring my pup next time.< /text>

I have been using this pharmacy since COVID-19 has started and I am so happy with the service. I usually get drive up or delivery. Pat usually answers the phone and takes my order and he is very knowledgeable with their products. They carry name brand buds  that are tested and that’s all I buy. He also delivers and he’s the best. He gets to my house within the hour of my order and I live about 8 miles from the pharmacy. Definitely recommend< /Review>

This is my favorite dispensary! I literally go at least once a week. The staff here is so friendly and knowledgeable. They have great daily deals and always having fun promos for their customers.

Most importantly they stand with the black community, and they give back to the neighborhood. They have so many options for pickup and delivery.

If I could give them 10 stars I would!< /Review>

<text>Hey google family so I visited this shop about a week and a half ago couple days before my birthday. Came in looking for hash and they did not have any😕. But what they did have was super awesome customer service. I didn’t feel rushed at all. Didn’t want to leave felt comfortable like home. Henry and the pretty lady coworker they were so knowledgeable. I ended up leaving a really happy customer. Thank you, you guys and gals!!😉😁🤟🏽</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
Guaranteed top-notch quality products Superb customer service  they will answer  any and all your  questions. You will leave satisfied.  They definitely have what you need ( try the teas ). Bud tenders are AWESOME( honestly ) as well as the young lady at the front desk who checks you in  (she always makes me smile ) even the security smiles and says hi and have a nice day. I absolutely LOVE  this place. GREAT to do business with.Safe environment as well. great job Leaf and Lion. It is an absolute pleasure to patronize your business. Leaf and Lion is highly recommended.</Review>

The Happiest Place on Earth... forget Disney!
I LOVE Leaf and Lion! I came to California on a birthday vacation from Texas and I couldn’t have asked for a better first (and second!) experience! Jessica was incredible and so, so knowledgeable. She really took the time to make sure we got every last thing we were looking for at the best price she could manage for us! Every member of the staff that we met made us feel so welcome and took the time to suggest cool places to hang out or go catch a great view and overall just make our experience absolutely amazing. This will always be a stop I’ll make time for when I’m here on a visit! Thank y’all at L&L so much for making my trip so enjoyable!
If y’all ever get a chance to stop by and see them, by all means DO IT. You won’t regret it!

P.S. Please remember to be respectful of the property and the properties surrounding the clinic... It is a residential neighborhood!<//Review>

<Text>I absolutely love going to this place. Wonderful customer service, wonderful environment. Since moving here from NY to California it has been difficult finding a shop that makes me feel comfortable purchasing CBD, but this shop does the job and I always recommend this place to anyone because of the great prices and the great deals they are always having.

<Review>Great service and a legit business! Some people may complain because of the different taxes they have to charge, but I'd rather pay the extra taxes and make sure I'm getting quality products than risk going to a place that isn't ran legitimately.

The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable and they also offer a veteran discount!<//Review><Date>1576640820651< /Date><username>Nestor Castaneda</username></record></dataset><record>

IF I COULD GIVE THEM 10 STARS I WOULD!
Leaf and Lion was my favorite dispensary out of the 3 dispensaries I went to. My friend and I are from out of state so we planned on doing quite a bit of activities revolved around weed.
Jessica helped us out and that girl new her green. She really made us feel at home and was so patient with us. Jessica and all the staff were giving us suggestions about places to go and see. They even hooked us up with some free bags/sunglasses/stash bag. We’ll be planning another trip back in the future and Leaf and Lion will definitely be our first stop. If you are in Long Beach, CA area make sure to check them out.</Review>

I’m from out of state, but when I saw such great reviews I knew I had to check this place out! First time going into a dispensary and the staff was incredibly nice I forgot the name of the lady who helped me but she was amazing! I ended up getting Camino infused gummies and man 10/10 every one of my friends and myself agree these are the best gummies ever. Really wish I lived in Cali so I could get more!!!!!</Review>

One of the best dispensaries around town, on top of the fact that it is legal-- it is of best interest to get high-quality, controlled, regulated, products from bud tenders who have actual knowledge regarding the products being sold to; instead of the typical shop that can be found locally, where most people are trying to get a quick buck. 100% recommend!< /Review>

<text>They have Raw Garden for $30 a half which is great and cheap and such a bomb cart. They have an array of flowers . Different farms too, so I like that it’s not the regular strains the other shops have . And also such affordable prices. They have Great CBD products and patches as well. 5% off for being a student , plus 5% for early bird and u can stack the discounts with their daily deals . 🔥< /text>< Pictures>

< Text>
(Translated by Google) Addict store. But everything is very civil. Rayonchik so-so. They conduct courses on the conduct of such a business. The usefulness of the courses is dubious and aimed rather at attracting personnel to your own store. Of the 6-hour course of useful information, there were 20 minutes.

(Original)
Наркоманский магазин. Но очень цивильно все. Райончик так себе. Проводят курсы по ведению подобного бизнеса. Полезность курсов сомнительная и направленная скорее на привлечение кадров в свой же магазин. Из 6-ти часового курса полезной информации было минут на 20.< /Text>
