Great customer service. Advising what needs and don't want for my dog age and breed. Little pricey but just like Nordstrom. Paying for customer service :-)</Text>

<review>Knowledgeable and friendly staff who informed me on what the guaranteed analysis meant on the nutritional panel. :) Good products, good brands, and they have rabbit, duck and venison blends if you like to stick with gamier foods for your little beast. They also have some organic brands if that's what you're looking for.</review>< Pics>

Went with a friend to bathe his dog. They have bathing areas for each dog. You put the dog in the elevated tub area and they have everything you need to bathe him.  The spray water is even warmed up for their  comfort. This also includes unlimited towels to dry him. The store has a great variety of pet food and things every animal needs.  The employees are very helpful and courteous.  I highly recommend it.</Text>

Over the last few months I have had both a cat and a dog come into my life, and this store has been instrumental in helping me set up for their stay. Every single employee there is incredibly knowledgeable about pet care, and obviously genuinely love animals.

Their self serve wash station is also amazing! Very comprehensive, not just the water, but also the blow dryer, shampoo, towels, and little treats. Reasonable price too.

I have worked in the veterinary field, and I really appreciate the  care and enthusiasm the staff here puts into their work. They are well educated about the products, and they are always willing to take the time to help you find what you need. There is a good variety of product lines, but everything seems to be higher quality. Higher quality means their prices are a bit more than your superstore buys, but it is worth it to me, because I cannot find food suitable for my dogs' diet restrictions at mega- stores. Even with the grooming area in the back, the store is always clean. I have been to the Pasadena location, as well, and would say the same positive things.

The only downside for this Glendale location is parking. You have to get lucky with street parking. It is not a problem for me to have to walk a bit and carry my items, but I can see how it would be difficult for someone with mobility issues. The staff always offers to help out customers to their vehicles, which helps lessen that inconvenience.</Review>

I've never been to a more excellent pet supply store. I've visited a couple times already, and every employee I've talked to 1) obviously, genuinely loves animals and 2) is extremely knowledgeable and straightforward about the products on shelf and about pet care - grooming, nutrition, etc. Apparently the company has a division that researches and verifies information companies claim about their products, as well as educates it's employees.

The store itself is bright, clean, organized - and I can't stress enough how excellent the employees are. Absolutely trust them when it comes to the purchases for my animals.< /Text>

We rescued our 13 month old Siberian Husky about 10 months ago. We have done nothing but the best for her, including spending $$$$ at Pet Express Glendale on the very best food, treats and weekly baths.. up until yesterday our experiences have been absolutely great! Everyone was so helpful and made each visit a treat. Well our wild little pup somehow got underneath our home which unbeknownst to us is infested with fleas 😞 and our poor all white baby was covered in fleas. We immediately got her out, sprayed the yard to kill all fleas (pet friendly and expensive stuff!!) and then raced her to Pet Express for a bath and some extra flea prevention. When we got there my husband went in and explain the situation, we had brought Dawn soap as we heard it was best and we just wanted to help our pup stop suffering. There was a gentleman there who told us we were right, dawn works best and helped set up my husband in the bathing area.. from there all the employees slowly came over one by one to look at our girl. I didn’t think much of it as they recommended topical flea solutions and other remedies to help avoid this in the future, Monah is on oral flea medication and until yesterday has never had even one flea on her. I went about my business, spent $30 on two tokens to wash her cause we felt like one bath wasn’t enough. Then the slap in the face cane, as I was walking around the store, I heard one gal talking about how horrible we were to allow this to happen and how our poor pup wasn’t been cared for and the rest of the employees chimed in. She made me feel so bad, my heart sank. The older gentleman realized I was in earshot and hushed everyone up rather quickly but needless to say the damage was done. We finished up with Monah and went to another pet store to buy the topical flea medicine they had suggested because at the end of the day I do want what is best for my girl but I refuse to help support that store anymore. I’d rather drive the extra few miles to the other Pet Express in Pasadena, better parking and less judgmental folks.< /text>

< Review>
Pretty unique , neat treats. Up until today my dog and I loved it there and stopped by everyday to buy him a treat. Majority of staff are pet friendly but not people friendly. There has been quite some unprofessionalism . Including talk behind customers backs in front of others customers. I have to share, today , my amazingly sweet and well behaved Staffordshire terrier that is loved by everyone was smelling a basket of treats and they accidentally fell down because quite obviously their structure wasn't right. One of the female employees all of a sudden got outraged,  stopped helping us, let everyone know how upset she was at my dog accidentally knocking down the basket and what a trouble it was for her to clean it up and mentioned she doesnt want to do this on her shift. The two females who's names I will not mention here continued to complain about the basket falling down accidentally, did  not want to ring me up and worst of all my Poor dog was SHAKING in FEAR because of how enraged that female was ! Perhaps she should not be working in a place that is geared for animals only. Now Trey and I have to find a new petstore.  Thanks a lot for your customer service.  Glendale Petfood Express on Central.

I like to be able to give my dog a bath rather than take him to the groomer.  Pet food Express offers a do-it-yourself bath. It's $15. For 25 minutes at a bath station that provides shampoo, conditioner, warm rinse water, a blow dryer, towels and they even clean up my mess afterwards.  So cool!<//review>

Cute store.  The pet self wash station is very well set up, cheap, and convenient.  I do wish they offered an actual dryer to blow out dogs with a double coat though.  The warm air blower they offered BARELY dryed my short haired pit bull and didn't dry my long haired, double coated corgi literally at all.  I would come back simply because it's one of the only pet self washes around, but not necessarily because the facilities are super amazing.  Decent if you've got a short haired dog, but if you don't, just go to a groomer.<//text>

Very knowledgeable and helpful staff. Feels like the Whole Foods of pet food stores. They carry some pet foods that are equivalent to the exclusive vet-prescribed foods, but at a much lower cost. They also have DIY dog wash stations with all the amenities. This is my new pet food destination!<//text>

Friendly people and they even have a little place for the dogs to play and socialise. They have great prices and friendly staff. It is not like pet co where it's hard to find help. This place even has a place in the back to wash your dog yourself. Great price and even has options to select from. Even has an option for sensitive dog skin.<//Review>

<text>I love this place, they have very good prices, very good brand name food for my cats (which is all real foods like duck, chicken, rabbit, turkey, salmon...[no by products] and some cans are bpa free), and knowledgeable employees. Everyone working here is so nice and helpful. I got some premium food for a very good price. So many good things to buy here. I am very picky with what I feed my cats and this place has everything I ever wanted. I will be a life long customer. I love the prices here. I rather go here than anywhere else for all my pets needs.</text><resp>None</resp><userid>101256849682397851393<//userid>< Name>

The very best pet store. The employees are super helpful and extremely friendly. They met our Frenchie, Handsome Lafayette and everytime we walk through the doors, they immediately ask for him and love him up. Amazing place witha great selection and a dog wash station in the back of the store. Wish I could give them 10 stars.</review>

This place is within walking distance from my apartment and the reviews looked promising. Self service bath is a rip-off, dog food selection is so-so but on average about 20% more than the same bag at petco and rawhide selection was small and overpriced.<//text>

Why Go Here? Great Product! Caring people! Ask all the questions , get all the answers. Parking Lot! Atmosphere is very mellow! No bumping Bass, no extremely loud noises, the lighting is mellow, does not bounce off glass cases. Perfectly Labeled Casing + if you do not understand the different available products offered the staff will gladly explain.
I heart them!</review>

<review>Hidden oasis cloaked as a club. It's an old ⛪ church and discreetly place. Friendly staff and good product. Other items not on menu - just ask. I will be back.<//review>< pictures>

Wonderful place! Great selection of both THC and CBD products. This place was an invaluable resource when my son was going through cancer treatment.

The staff is wonderful! Helpful, friendly, knowledgeable. They are all really kind and treat with you respect.</Text>

<review>There is a High level of professionalism going on in this place. The tenders answer all of my nutty buddy  questions and are consistently friendly and warm. The experience is easy and painless. There is absolutely never any attitude with security crew or the owners or bud tenders. After making the rounds, I have made this place ...homebase!< /review>< Rating>

<review>As a 70 year old stoner who hadn't bought retail cannabinoids in a long while (A-dam 78?), I was reticent to buy legally in the US. What a pleasant surprise! Stuff I never thought about is available with knowledgeable people who kindly helped me with the shock and awe of it all. I think that the prices are good and the mixtures of goods is great.

< review>
Basically had the worst anxiety at a medical club I've ever had. I'm a returning patient and having been coming to Telegraph Health Center for 3 years and I came in today (Nov 1st) and forgot I needed to update my medical recommendation and had to look for it in my email. As I was searching the woman at the front desk with glasses kept rushing me, saying "if I didn't have my rec I couldn't be in there". I suffer from an anxiety disorder and the woman at the front desk kept rushing me in a very aggressive manner making my anxiety flare.

I know I came in close to closing, but that doesn't mean I should be made to feel unwelcome and rushed. For a place dedicated to helping medicinal patients, this was definitely not conducive to healing whatsoever. A little bit of kindness and compassion go a long way.</review>

< review>
I went there today my first visit, needing to use the bathroom the lady told me they didn't have one. she says there's a Café across the street you could use their bathroom. You know that's not right, every dispensarie that I have went to has nice clean bathrooms for the patients. this place is not worth going to. there's so many others with clean bathrooms. I didn't even stay. I checked in got a chip saw  how long the line was, gave the lady back the chip and walked out. Word to the wise go to the bathroom before going to this place if you got to wait in line. Question to the owner: why won't you let your patient use your bathroom cuz I know you guys have one.</review>

I've been bringing my family here for over 3 decades and we love the food here. I like that they haven't changed the interior, I like the painted tiles on the table tops and the smell of the taquitos being fried up , it brings back good memories of past visits there and meals being cooked at home. I really enjoyed the simple but tasty salad which I love mixing with my frijoles. They have great customer service and I pray they have greater success in the future. 🙏🏼😎🌮< /Review>

Nice little shop with cheap pricing for the area. The food itself was plentiful, though the quality was just okay. Not truly authentic Mexican food, but not so Americanized either: rather somewhat of an inbetween. Perhaps a good place for those not too familiar with Mexican cuisine, or simply are looking for a cheap and quick bite to eat. However the service was excellent!</review>

<review>Dude, I was a burrito fan until I had the fish tacos here.  They are awesome.  Even if the food was subpar, the salsa bar is top notch.  They have the cleanest and widest selection of salsa in LA  I definitely feel the liquid hot fire the next day, but it feels oh so good when I'm here.</review>< resp>

Great burritos, and at price points that put to shame the more expensive but not any better places. This is a true taqueria - few frills and not designed for people to hang out. You come here for good and fairly cheap (easily under $10) food.<//Text>

It was a good choice to eat here. The food is great and the place is cozy. I really like the place for it was air-conditioned. They also have different menus here. The dish that we ordered was chicken marsala, chili chicken and piccata. It was all served fresh and tasty. I really like how it cooked. I would be coming back here again.</review>

<date>1563030930139<//date><rate>5</rate><review>This is a great Mexican Cafe located in the heart of Placita Olvera the famous “Pueblito de los Angeles”. Family ran business managed by his current owner Edward Flores (3rd generation).

They have combination plates at affordable prices, the food tastes great and their “Champurrado” (Hot Chocolate) pairs great with any breakfast.

The Torta or Burrito de Chorizo are amazing, you can also try the Sopes.

My favorite cafe of all time. Try the taquitos with the sauce on the side to dip into👍 Comes with a side of beans and a simple but flavorful salad. Extremely fast service and cook time! All around good, can’t go wrong with eating here😊< /text>

Im all about supporting small mom and pop shops, but this place need serious help! My daughter and I got a series stomach virus after eating here. Authentic Mexican food is full of delicious flavor I can't say the same about this joint. They need to up their menu and bring down the prices. If your going to sell unflavored food at least have some decent prices. They totally take advantage of the clientele.< /Review>

Solid chicken burrito and the salsa has the right amount of kick.  Obviously this is a small fast food option and in that category this place gets a solid five star.  Friendly and efficient service and fair prices.< /review>

I cannot say enough wonderful things about Juanita's.  Their taquitos are the best in the whole world.  Their "green sauce" is in a world of its own.   I have been eating their my entire life as have my children.  I'm sure everything else is wonderful but I can't not have my taquitos!!  I will never have taquitos anywhere but Juanita's.< /Review>

I enjoy coming to eat here out of all the other little restaurants. My family and I always get received with great customer service. It's true, you must try the guacamole here. It compliments the taquitos very well.  I like to go there during the week, because during the weekend, it is impossible to find parking.< /text>

Im sorry but we ate here on our crazy la trip and im all for supporting the raza but they price their food quite high and the place is quite rundown. I dont want them to go out of business but my professional opinion is that they should REMODEL so many people pass by this restaurant and end up choosing a different one because of its appearance because if I would have looked at the place a bit better and the prices I would have left faster than a guy who gets that "Im late" text.<//review>

I was there on April 5th for the second time, first time was back on 1995 was leaving in the streets at that time no family in California, I thought the taquitos I had that day were the best thing I ever had or I was just really hungry. after a few years  end up in Phoenix az got married got kids in my mind I always wanted to comeback and eat at jonitas cafe, 25 years later I did took my family there they loved the food the place very friendly, and i confirmed my self that i wasn't just hungry back then. the food it's really amazing good flavor, good taste, great place I'm planning to visit again sometime in June...</Review>

Mexican food that hits the spot. Chicken tacos and enchiladas were amazing, full of flavor, with great guac/salsa toppings. Extra half-star for the great fountain soda- an art often lost now-a-days!</Text>

< Review>
After trying to look for a parking for 1 hour due to construction and a running event we arrived. A lot of people around we get there and a rude old man cooking told us he was closed! He tells us of we want to order to go i tell him we came from az to eat here but he didn't care. Flautas were small and everything looked dry! I'm glad I didn't eat there! This place is not what it used to be and workers need to learn some customer service. I will never return I guess I will take my memories on when I ate here and it was good. Also their counter part on the corner is bad! you should both be ashamed to call your establishment Mexican food!</Review>

<Review>Been coming to Jaunita's for over 40 years!! Only a handful of tables at this little location on historic Olvera Street. Try the taquitos...the green sauce is their signature. The homemade red sauce they place on the table is spicy for most but adds great flavor to any dish...I mean paper plate!!! I recommend the #3.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Over rated.  Food prices comparable to other Mexican outlets in the area.  Portions comparable, very little meat content. Taste mediocre.  Have had better, not really authentic.< /Text>

<Text>The guy that was cooking was very rude !! Didn’t great us until after 10 min that we were waiting there. Also wanted to order rice for my kids and he said he was out ! Ask for Jamaica and he was out! And then to top it off when I was paying he said his matching wasn’t working . So my husband has to find an ATM at night in a area that we don’t know ; because we are not from LA. Last day of our vacation and he ruined the last day!

Stop by for a cup of champurrado.  The champurrado at Juanita's Cafe is the least expensive at $2.00 of any of the food stall on Olvera Street.  It is possibly also the best tasting one too.</Text>

I love this perfect hole-in-the-wall! In fact, most foods I love, come from these type of places.
It has intimate seating so be prepared to sit close with others. I see it as sitting with family. Even if we dont know eachother, Juanita Cafe has a way of making you feel welcomed as if you were one of their own. Lots of good memories and food come from this cute tiny kitchen. They've been here for years!
My Mum and her Mum have been going here for a long time, and then intruduced me to this place as a kid, and I've been going here ever since. When I can go, its definitely worth the drive!

The food is authentic! I go for their tequitos with EXTRA cheese, and their Guacamole and other sauces. Especially their handmade red sauce which is really spicy! They even have a yummy green chili sauce that may look simple however it sure packs a lot of flavor! I love this place! 💖</review>

We've been coming to Juanita's for 20 years.  Normally during the Dodgers season since we live in the Coachella Valley.   But We Can't Go To A Game Without Stopping By Olvera Street and Eating The Taquittos.  If You Haven't Tried Juanita's,  Its A Must.<//review>

I was renewing my bus pass and looked around and eyed the fresh cakes. It was my roommates b-day so I got a nice 8 inch vanilla yellow with strawberry center, frosted with whipped cream and a nice diamond chocolate grid and drizzle.</text>

They opened late at 6.06am and the ladt that opens the door insisted l put my workout bag next to the cashier's shelf (very dirty) where its just a few feet from the entrance. I told her l came in and shopped a few times before and no one told me to do what she insisted me to do... So l did reluctantly...<//text>

This place is great. I'm new to City Heights from a small town in New Hampshire, and this place feels like home. All types of people shop here, but it's primarily a Mexican food store. It has lots of staple supplies, veggies, and the great darned chorizo I've ever had. The checkout staff is so nice, and the giant security guard at the front has a heart of gold. Even though everyone here is bilingual, I've even learned a little Spanish so I can impress these people. They learned English, so I should learn Spanish! The Mexican pastries and snacks are a little weird, but I love trying new things. This is a great neighborhood store, and I'm lucky to live right next door :)< /review>

Nice little grocery store. The selection is a bit limited as it's small, but it has fresh tortillas, a deli and a meat counter. The cashiers are usually very friendly. It has a money center counter where you can get money orders or send Western Union, although it tends to randomly close. The ATM charges $3 and is pretty hit or miss on if it's operational or not.< /review>

<Review>Great prices and friendly staff! No organic fruits or vegetables, however, large selection of items that are not needing to be organic for you to have great health. Fresh baked breads (pan) and tortillas. Huge selection of butcher shop meats.

Very pleased with the selection of Tadin teas. Hibiscus, Damiana, Verbena, Passionflower and more.<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>I go there every month to pay my San Diego Metro Transit System monthly pass. Although the cashier's office was closed when I got there, the attendant returned promptly at the time that the clock said she'd be back precisely 5:35 p.m., so it was well worth my while to complete the task and wait for 15 minutes.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

The building shows its age both inside and out but they have excellent meat and produce departments and they run excellent specials. This is a little oasis in a grocery desert.<//Text>

They see that you are there and just keep acting like they are doing something there, lines could be empty for couple of minutes but they just stand there, rather than helping a customer trying to make a payment or refill a bus pass<//review>< Pics>

A google user is right, I've felt that. While in line for a money order, I was blatantly ignored for a few minutes right after they helped another more obvious mexican pretty much lickety split. The place is good for what I need it for though.

Oh also like 2 years ago my roommate found metal shavings in her chicken she bought. She did get a replacement when we mentioned this which was nice. I don't know how that went cause I wasn't there.
The place is good for what I need it for.<//review>

I said where am I going to get a 1/2 sheet cake in 2 hours?? She says I don't know?? Esperanza another employee very nice , not rude like the so called manager .anyway Esperanza called the other Murphys to ask them if they could make the cake for me?  Thank god they did!!! Ana laughed at our faces when she saw us being upset for not having a cake so I told her it was not a laughing matter I said I'm sure if this was happening to you and your son you would be mad too!! Long story short, I called Sammy who I was told it is the owner? He already knew about the incident and offered to make it up to my son..that was very nice of him and I appreciate it but if I was him I would not have employees like ana working for me because they need nice polite employees not rude and disrespectful like ana......I just want to say to ana karma is a bi..h!!!!!! Thank you Esperanza and the other girl who made my son's cake you get 5 stars....< /Text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Ok, what I did not like is that they do not have carts for the errand and one has to load the errand in a basket and it was very heavy for me and the corn is already old and expensive that I did not like.

Esta bien lo que no me gustó es que no tienen carros para el mandado y uno tiene que cargar en una canasta el mandado y estaba para mi muy pesado y el elote está ya viejo y caro eso no me gusto.</text>

(Translated by Google) Very fresh foods and vegetables but today I went and I really did not like the attention given by the butcher's staff. I think it is new, the lord of there needs training on how to treat clients because they do not feel like asking for Something speaks to you and I don't even answer. I work attending people and the most important thing is to greet with a smile to make the clientele feel good.

(Original)
Comidas y verduras muy frescas pero hoy fui y la verdad no me gusto la atención que da el personal de la carnicería creo que es nuevo el señor de ahi  le hace falta entrenamiento de como tratar a los clientes porque no dan ganas ni de pasar a pedir algo le habla uno y ni le contesta yo trabajo atendiendo gente y lo más importante es saludar con una sonrisa para hacer sentir bien a la clientela.< /Text>

Highly recommend Taqueria Gonzalez. I was there yesterday and was very satisfied with their food. Service was fast and staff is very friendly and courteous. Portions are big and the taste is authentic. You won't regret eating there!</text>

< Review>
Not sure how this Taqueria ranked so high on Yelp. The food is medicore at best. The cashier and cook did not understand the difference between grilled and griddled. Both salsa rojo and verde had a watery texture. The chicken was over salty and the flour tortilla was chewy because it was not warmed properly. I could go on but i will end with the fact, i will not be returning. I wasted $23.00. I would rather spend time and gas to eat in the Mission District. 3 stars is overrated.<//Review>

There are a couple of options, but I chose this  taqueria because there is construction going on and I wanted to give them business as I know that can make it a challenge. This decision paid off! I got a carnitas and refried bean burrito with Verde sauce. It was perfection! I was greeted with a smile and good service. At least while under construction, I don't think this is a handicap accessible option.< /Text>

They serve things that aren't on the menu also like fish burrito or tacos so if you don't see something you want just ask if they have it. Nice little place reasonable price.</Review>

<Text>Little pricey, one thing that disappointed me was the $2 taco happy hour.. the tacos are half the size of the normal tacos and only a doller less. Don't advertise $2 tacos that aren't the same portion as your normal tacos, i believe thats FALSE ADVERTISING. Other then that i love the food, great tacos and the soups are AMAZING, thats the only reason I give them 3 stars.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Tried so many other taquerias, but this is the go-to everytime and honestly an underrated place. I always get their Al Pastor tacoss, packed with flavor plus tacos don't get soggy and fall apart. Always excellent, caring service and delicious food. Highly recommend their breakfast, especially the Guatemalan breakfast with eggs, chorizo, beans, tortillas, YUM! Their weekend specials soups are great too. Glad this is here now!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Rate>

< Review>
I have lived in this area almost ten years and never been to Harvey’s. Given the Pandemic, I’ve been trying to support small restaurants because I used to own one. This place did NOT disappoint. The customer service, I think the owners, are an older couple and couldn’t be sweeter. The food was hot and yum! And as skeptical as I am about a good steak sandwich, this one was DELISH! I’ll be back. Sad it took me so long to try this place out!!<//Review>

Incredible. Philly cheese steak I’ll definitely be coming back for. Owner is adorable. This place is immaculate. Made me happy just eating here. Every person coming in at lunch seems to be on a first name basis.

Eat here.</Text>

<Review>I ordered a pastrami. The meat was a bit salty and dry for my taste. The bread was also a bit dry.  Will not go back I'm sorry.  Maybe the burgers are good?</Review>< Name>

Try the pastrami and cheese sandwich or the Philly cheese steak sandwich.  Both are delicious.  That's the only items I order so can't give reviews of the other items.</review>

Their refills cost a buck! Was going to take away a star for predatory soda pricing unless the food was amazing.

The bulgogi burger combo was amazing!

Make sure to enhance your fries with the seasoning salt and tangy barbeque-but-not-quite sauce next to the ketchup.

The burger itself has no ground beef Patty, only tender layers of bulgogi beef. So burger is a sliiiiight misnomer, though the bun and toppings are definitely burgeresque. As someone who loves a good burger, it was a good presentation of a bulgogi sandwich. Bulgogi + melty white cheese (provolone?) beats out all but the very very best cheese steak for me.

I only worry that with such a large menu, not everything could be as good as what I had. I will definitely be back to find out!</review>

Haven't eaten here just stopped to get a menu. Looks clean inside and it's ran by a Korean woman. A lot if different choices on the menu.< /Review>

This park is small. There are homeless peoples hanging around baseball bleachers and surrounding area. Restroom maintenance is subpar. There is a little area you can picnic or relax . It is a mini park.<//Text>

<Review>My dog bit my left hand pretty good (not viciously, she had swallowed something  - long story).  The index finger and thumb took the worst of it and an infection was setting in. I called in the morning for an appointment and the staff got me in that afternoon. Dr Kraft and his staff were great as usual. Exam, dressed the punctures and a tetanus shot in 20 minutes.< /Review><GmapID>0x80945d3159767ec9:0x191d2bbf02db8347< /GmapID><Response>None</Response>< Pics>

< Review>
First time meeting Dr. Kraft. Very genuine—he had a busy schedule and yet didn’t seem rushed. He was prompt to the appointment and spent a good amount of time trying to discern the issue and how we could best approach resolution. I respected his knowledge level, and fully trust his hypothesis was correct without MRI results. Most importantly, he had a great bedside candor.<//Review>

<Text>I've been a patient of Dr. Rod Kraft for at least 5 years now. To find a Dr. And staff that exceeds your expectations had proven to be difficult. Until I was referred here! The staff is timely and professional. My experience with Dr. Kraft had been nothing but exceptional. I trust his knowledge and guidance. He makes the patient feel heard and cared for.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

I love Dr Kraft. He is great. But his office staff is rude, unprofessional and you have to follow up repeatedly with everything because they literally never do what they are supposed to do. They just flat out do not do their job.</Review>

I can't speak to office personnel nor am I a fan of SPOC's billing practices,  but Dr. Kraft is excellent and extremely competent at his job.  I am always very satisfied with my appointments with him.<//Text>

<Text>Dr Kraft's office is ridiculously slow at processing any request, and God forbid you have to have an approval for any medication.  If you do, expect a two week wait, and don't expect it to be correct.<//Text>< resp>

Love this vicinity! The workforce are high-quality friendly, knowledgeable and wonderful judges of your health/ability level, pushing you enough which you get an first rate exercising/training consultation. Joined with a pal and we have been entire neophytes to boxing however they give an explanation for the entirety very actually and make it simply enjoyable. The gymnasium itself is absolutely nicely prepared and the whole lot is spotless. distinctly advocate.</text>

<Text>I've taken 2 bootcamps at Titanium and thoroughly enjoyed both!  Simon and Paul definitely make you work and as exhausting as it is getting to the gym by 6am, it is so worth it!  It's a friendly atmosphere for beginners like me - Aside from the great workout and boxing skills I've learned, I had a lot of fun!< /Text>< pics>

I can't say enough amazing things about this class. Decided to try it out after hearing good things about it on class pass. It lived up to the hype and more. I got the best workout iv gotten in a long time. This class is no joke. Lolo walked me though everything and didn't make me feel like an idiot for my sad punches and horrible burpees. Amazing! Will be back.< /Text>

<Text>Saying that I love this place is an understatement. It checks the box in so many categories.
Amazing in regards to fitness; for me there there’s no better way to get into shape. The strength you achieve both mentally and physically is amazing.<//Text>< time>

<text>I am so happy that I have come across Nate and Thomas (the coaches). They are fitness experts and have done so much to help me get healthier. They offer a workout that is second to none and customize it for my injuries and limitations.

Coaches made me feel welcome as soon as walked in. Nobody is here to judge at all, everybody is here to help you get better, and nothing but good vibes everyday!
I’ve already worked with almost all the coaches and every one of them is great! Always pushing me to get better all the time!

Love this place! The staff are super friendly, knowledgeable and excellent judges of your fitness/ability level, pushing you enough that you get an excellent workout/training session. Joined with a friend and we were complete neophytes to boxing but they explain everything very clearly and make it really enjoyable. The gym itself is really well equipped and everything is spotless. Highly recommend.</Text>

Solid gym. Coaches want to help you learn. Free parking. Many different forms of training available. Currently taking boxing; they also offer sparring classes to allow for real life learning while putting safety and technique first. Definitely recommend checking out.<//Review>

The staff was super positive and the gym was spotless.  The showers were new and very clean.  The owner of the gym will come say hello and ask if you need anything.  Great experience. I will go back any chance I get.</review><user_name>Edmund Keefe<//user_name>< UserId.>

<Text>I was very nervous at first, but the teachers here are amazing! I got to experience the boxing classes with Will and Matt as well as the weight lifting class with Jacob. The three of them are amazing and super supportive! You can redeem your first free class through their website/instagram if you wanted to check them out.

The gym itself is very accessible in Chinatown. I have only gone during the weekdays in the mornings before work.

Hands down one of my favorite places to go! I will be back~< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

There's no pretense or macho posturing at Strong Sports, as evidenced by the types of people who frequent the gym - friendly, diverse and dedicated to more than just boxing. Mo & Willard take the time to understand your circumstances in order to build a plan just for you. It's definitely the most welcoming gym I've been to, this coming from someone with zero boxing experience. They've also done a nice job adapting to the size of the space: It's clean, minimal and inviting.<//Review>< Pics>

I love, love, love this Gym. I have NEVER been a gym person but I have such a good time. I forget that I’m also working out. The classes are great and they make sure to explain everything. They care and you can tell. If you haven’t had a good experience at gyms before you will love this one. They make you feel welcome and they never make you feel bad if you don’t understand something. It will feel like home right away.< /Text>

I’ve never been a gym person (or much of an exercise person to be honest) but Strong  Sports Gym is changing that. Classes are small so you get personalized attention from coaches, and they always explain they reasons for techniques which makes it easier to learn. Other members are great and encouraging, and you never have that “corporate” gym feeling where you’re anonymous or that instructors are just going through the motions.< /text>

Ample parking at various hours. Conveniently located next to the gold line metro and 101/110. It's also next to the serene LA public park - great for a warm-up before class. There are plenty of great offers, esp. for first timers. The staff is friendly and very knowledgeable, in contrast to generic gyms. Classes are informative and I always retain valuable info I could use later. Nice amenities (eg) towels, hygiene products in the shower...etc.

The main reason it doesn't get the full five starts is that some of the juicier classes don't fit my schedule. Also, membership is costly. The soap is very harsh on my hair.< /Text>

Sometimes, you can spend years in a place and still feel like a stranger. On the other hand, there are those where from day-one you’re treated like part of the family. Strong Sports Gym is one of those places. Since I’ve been here I got to train, hang out, and share laughs with some of the best people I’ve had the fortune to be around. Willard Ford’s vision has manifested into a unique community that welcomes everyone and also offers extremely high-level coaching from Mac Danzig, Coach Moe, and Willard himself. And the new location is pretty great too.<//text>

<text>Great technical instruction from the seasoned coaches. The gym is kept extremely clean and immaculate. The vibe is very inviting and welcoming to beginners and pros alike.

I started going to this gym last year with zero boxing experience and now I’m hooked.

They also provide Olympic Weight lifting classes and conditioning which have both changed the way I look at working out.

This is more than just a gym, it’s a place for pushing yourself, working out smart and being surrounded by good people.

I highly recommend trying it out, you won’t regret it!</text>< Gmap_id>

This gymnasium is inclusive, passionate, humble, and a really good time. I started out by taking the women’s boxing class but it wasn’t long before I was signing up for all other types of classes. I show up and work hard and I know the coaches have me on a path to somewhere. I love it< /text>

Food was good, although menu is on the rich/heavy side. Difficult funding a healthy/lighter option. Restaurant is small and doesn't have the best parking (metered street or paid lots are your options).<//Review>

Cash Only. BYOB.. yes BYOB!! Bring a case of brews and ask for a bucket of ice!! Delicious grilled fish and fresh seafood. Great place for Latin style seafood dishes. Comfortable with TVs and live musicians come in to play your favorite tune if you so wish.< /Text>

Love their green spicy salsa. They serve it with chips before ordering but it's also great with Ceviche de Camaron. I gave it 4 stars because of parking. It has a small lot in the alley and probably fits about 6 cars or so. It gets full at times.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Very good Prawns Butter wing (That what 'k!) What is required is, a little more customer service and quick service. Understanding that the restaurant is full, and if so, they should consider generating more employees.

Don't Use Dutton Plumbing! We had a terrible experience with Dutton Plumbing! Out of urgency, took advantage of their well-advertised $73 drain cleaning. They were very professional, COVID protocols in place and timely. However, diagnosed a major problem, which would immediately cost over $900 as a short-term fix, then diagnosed a clean out drain pipe replacement issue, which would have cost us $10,000-$20,000+!! When I pushed back on the $900, technician said he could talk to his supervisor and probably reduce the cost to $600ish. Nope! I asked them to send me the bid in writing and I was going to get a second opinion. Never received the bid, no follow up phone call, nothing. Called another plumber, referred by a friend and guess what...our pipes are fine, there are no immediate issues and the clean out pipe DOES NOT need replacing! In talking to friends, they've had similar experiences with Dutton. Disappointing, to say the least! How many people have they taken advantage of?? I responded to their survey about the service and no response.</Text>

<Text>I was charged $395 to repair a pipe in the backyard that had broke at the connection point to another pipe. They were here for about an hour. The plumber was professional and very nice. Company provided photo of whom I should expect. Overall great customer service but severely overpriced, especially since only the connector pipe was replaced and originally pipe was reattached. The price would prevent me from using services in the future. I had to have the main water turned off due to pipe break at the section, so shopping for a better price was limited due to time constraint.< /Text><name>Pamela S< /name><date>1612816020618<//date>< GmapID>

<text>We have been part of the Dutton plumbing "family" since 2008; obviously, we are happy with them!  Yesterday, was the BEST experience ever.  For our yearly maintenance, they sent Technician Roth Foster.  Roth was not only professional and thorough, but took the time to explain problems that he saw.  To make it easier, Roth took photos of the problems to help us understand what needed to be done.  I want Roth to be "our technician" always!< /text></record>

<Review>David Silva and his partner Jonathan were terrific. They were punctual, polite, and professional. They went out of their way to make sure the leak was fixed and that they left everything the way it was.

<rating>1< /rating><review>I found a leak in my garage pipe and needed to fix as soon as possible.  I found Dutton Plumbing on the internet.  They were quick to respond and were very pleasant on the phone and the tech was very pleasant as well.  I received a quote to fix the leak of $540.  Since I needed it fixed I didn't question it. After speaking with my husband it just didn't sound right. They replaced 8 inches of copper pipe 1 joint 1 elbow and sweat 4 connections. It took 45 minutes start to finish. Then the tech talked me into a $79 dollar yearly family plan that really only gives me 10% off future purchases. I called the operator and questioned the $79 dollar charge and was told that my repair would have been higher if I did not purchase the plan?????  At this point I was so frustrated I just let it go but I really do feel I was taken advantage of because of the timing (2 days before xmas) and I really did not have a chance to price shop. I will chalk this one up to my mistake and hope this review will make others think twice.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7sOhDTmLnGoxJ0VlWSR9RGphlMngW8-66bv4Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

John Medina, Larry and Jonathon did a great job rerouting the hot and cold water piping to the house.  The crew was polite and presented great communication skills keeping me informed of what they had planned to do with the route taken and why.
Thank you to William and Randy also of the management team!

Called Dutton for service on a faulty water heater. They told me that someone would be out that day.  Waited all day. 3 phone calls from them stating that they would have someone out soon. 3 full days of waiting at home. 15 waste of time phone calls from them. Finally just told them to forget it. Who has time to sit around and wait for someone to show up?  Worst experience ever for a service company.  What a joke. Unless you have a week to wait. Don't bother!</Text>

The plumbers that came to my house (Shannon and Joel) were seriously amazing.  We have used many different plumber companies in the past and never received service like this before.  We will only use Dutton moving forward.  Not only were they knowledgable and able to fix multiple issues (other plumbers could not), they were also very friendly, took their time to explain things and made sure there were no other issues.  They were life savers and fixed an issue I have had for 3 months that no other plumber could.  Highly recommend them!!!<//review>

<pics>None<//pics><Text>In October of 2020 we had to have some plumbing under the kitchen sink replaced. It worked fine for about 6 months until an entire pipe became detached and flooded under the sink. We called that night and were told that we would be helped the next day. It has been two days and we’ve been rescheduled twice. This is unacceptable. Not only is our kitchen sink inoperable right now, but I’ve had to call out of work for 2 days and now a third just to wait around for nothing to happen. I’m disappointed. The sink pipe replacement shouldn’t have failed so quickly, and I should not have to call out of work just to be told “we’ll get there tomorrow for sure”. We will be using another pluming service after this repair.<//Text>< Rate>

<Text>Extend dryer gas pipe 8 feet along outside of a wall. Replace hot and cold water valves. 5 hrs. total. I was quoted $1340.00. No way. So then lowered price to $890.00. No price base to estimate was used. Seamingly arbitrary to see what could be gotten but was just beyond reason. I had to relent to $890 because calling someone else and taking another day off without pay would add up to that. But I had then gotten an over-the-phone quote for $70/hr + parts. Got me!  $30 parts. Over $150/hr. Beware!!!  No show first scheduled day and took day off work. Estimate to replace plumbing in the bathroom remodel - $9000. More than the entire remodel quote from a GC. Same job quoted for $2600 by another county plumbing co. Something wrong here folks.  It was beyond belief. Then I see these reviews of the same rip off.  No ethics. Obviously the BBB should know.  Or they can refund me to reasonable peer competitive rate. Beware!</Text>< Pics>

<Review>Two men came from Dutton. They were very nice and professional. They charged $39 to come out. I dealt with several other plumbing companies, which came for free. There initial quote was more than 2X the other companies. When I would not accept their quote they lowered it but still several hundred dollars above any of the other plumbers. I had the work done by another plumber, but wasted my $39.<//Review><Name>Chuck Hubbard</Name></record>

<text>So, we bought this awesome new slide in gas range after waiting 6 months because of the COVID delay for appliances - super frustrating. Thought it was going to be easy - old range out, new range in. WRONG. the configuration and recessed space for the gas line on the new range did not align with the old one. So, my new range wouldn't just slide in to the wall but leave a 3"gap behind the range - not acceptable. The solution - having to move a gas line. I am a DIY guy but prefer not to blow myself or my family up when dealing with gas, so had to call the professionals.

Called Dutton at 1:51 pm on a Monday and they had Steve, their gas specialist, out at my house before 4:00 pm. He and his apprentice looked at, accessed and gave me options for my repair/fix. It was ultimately going to take more time than completing it the same day. So, we were Steve's first appointment the following day. He was prompt, polite and professional. His work was clean and thorough. He made sure that everything worked as it should before he left. Totally impressed with Steve and the Dutton Team. Price was fair and appreciated Steve's attention to detail.

I hope that I never have to move a gas line again, but if I do, I'm calling Dutton.<//text>< pics>

They called back and said they could do it for $13,222. She said no. They called again and said $11,500. She found a handy man, who fixed it for $750.00, and gave her a lifetime grantee even if she sells her place.She didn’t need a repipe. It’s really sad how these big company’s take advantage. How do they live with themselves?  It’s disgusting.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80e82ebed5b30749:0x6a99858c7f6e0140< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5</rate><review>Without a doubt the most knowledgeable plumbers out there.  That said, their "pricing" is wonky.  I've been using them for 15 years at two different houses.  It's always a haggle.  The on scene guy gives you a price range, but the manager by phone makes the final adjustments when you start breaking down the per item/service price.  Once you get past all that though, you'd be hard pressed to find a better crew with more resources available to you...one job I had 3 van loads of guys at my house.  So you DO get what you pay for.  It's a love/hate relationship.  I wouldn't want anyone else working on my house....but it's always a bit of a tussle at the beginning.  If you're comfortable asking questions and putting in some work, these guys won't disappoint.<//review>< Pics>

COMPLETE LIARS! BEWARE!  I called  them out to light pilot on water heater - the serviceman looked at it for about two minutes and immediately said I needed a new water heater. We asked if there was anything else that could be done - he said maybe - he would have to call the office. We had him leave as he couldn't or wouldn't help. We had another plumber (Highsmith & Daughters) out an hour later who relit the pilot for us and cleaned the fire screen . He was done in about 20 min.. This is how Dutton operates - they will either upsell or lit to you to get you to spend hundreds or thousands on things you do not need. I have reported them to the BBB as well.</review>

I've used Dutton twice now and each experience was exemplary of what customer service can and should be.  The issues were very far apart in terms of severity.  The first issue was just inspecting and replacing a kitchen faucet. The second was replacing a water heater.

Both times the technician was prompt, courteous, patient, and explained the issue in great detail.  They were upfront and honest about their prices and offered me a multitude of options to fit my budget and fix the issue the same day.  I did not feel pressured or pushed and I felt they went above and beyond to find solutions that would not require me to shell out astronomical costs.

In particular, I'd like to compliment Cole and Sean who I dealt with on the water heater issue.  Without their help and guidance, I could have had a much larger problem on my hands in the immediate and in the future. They even provided me with a solution that will make the lifespan of my new water heater last much longer.<//text>

I understood that my appt would between 9-11am on Tuesday.  When their dispatcher called, she said the tech was on another job and would not be available until the afternoon. She would call around 1:00.  When she did call, she said the tech was hung up on the morning job and I would be his first appt the following morning; to expect a call at 8:00am.  No call.  I called at 8:35 and she said the tech was on an emergency related to the previous day's job, and she would get hold of his manager.  I told her to tell the manager that I was very displeased with their service.  The manager called at 9:00 and said someone was not reading his schedule right and the tech would be at my house in 15 minutes.  He was, but he said he had no knowledge of my appt the day before.  I told him we contacted another plumbing company, and they were coming out at 1:00.  So he left without doing the work.  Dutton is expensive and unreliable.  I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.</text>

Outrageous.  As him to leave. They did waive the service fee.</text>< response>

Could not get any more incompetent than Dutton Plumbing. Don’t use them!  If you do, you’ll be sorry. Called on Thursday, they stood me up for Friday appointment. Then stood me up for Saturday. Had the audacity to ask if they could come on Monday. Wow! The worst of the worst! 0 stars if possible as they couldn’t even earn one star.< /text>

I had a simple leaking faucet like most people do so I called Dutton Plumbing in Santa Clarita. When the service tech arrived, I explained the problem and symptoms of the leak and showed him that when I applied light downward pressure to the hot water handle, the drip would stop. This guy, without ever looking under the sink or taking the water handle off to inspect the fixture told me that my entire faucet fixture would have to be rebuilt and replace the shut off valves under the sink or only replace the valves. Without inspecting the valves or the faucet itself, he gave a quote for $515 for replacing the valves and $795 for rebuilding the faucet and replacing the valves, both of which I declined as the cost seemed unusually high.

I emailed the company that manufactured the faucet and provided the exact same description of the problem via email that I gave Dutton Plumbing’s service tech in person. The faucet manufacturer replied back suggesting that I replace the seats and springs under the faucet handle and provided me with the part number. I purchased a two pack of the part for $4.98 and a tube of silicone grease for $4.00 at Home Depot and installed them myself in 10 minutes, resulting in the leak being fixed.

Dutton Plumbing not only misdiagnosed how to fix the leak, they suggested work that did not EVEN need to be done at the cost of nearly $800. They do this stuff for a living, so how could they not EVEN suggest replacing the seats and springs? But instead, he told me that I need to replace my entire faucet fixture and valve handles. I don't like being cheated and that is exactly what this place tried to do to me.

DO NOT let them do any work until you get a second opinion and estimate. They wanted to charge me $800 for work that did not need to be done AT ALL and I ended up fixing the leak myself and it literally cost me LESS THAN the price of a movie ticket. Read the Yelp reviews and you'll see a pattern of them trying to overcharge people.

I spoke to someone at the Dutton after they saw my review and he tried to make up an excuse, saying that they might suggest repairs that are "more comprehensive." There's a big difference between "more comprehensive" and repairs that are not required AT ALL. Crooks!<//Text>

Dutton assisted in discovering some faulty sewer pipes under our slab  in December - they identified the problem and corrected with a combination of new pipe and a new lining for existing pipes - we recently had an inspection this August and discovered a new problem in one of the pipes that we all thought was corrected. Dutton stepped up and under the supervision of Randy dispatched crews to correct the problem in a very timely manner - all I can say is that it is really nice to find a contractor that not only say they stand behind their work and but like Dutton actually do - thanks to the entire Dutton team for a job well done and a special thanks to Randy for having our back.  We would recommend using Dutton for any of your plumbing requirements.</Text>

Clamps were placed on hot and cold water copper pipes. That eliminated the knocking sound in the house. The service technician (Jerry) and his assistant were very professional and the work was done efficiently and quickly. We have been with Dutton Plumbing for many years and highly recommend them.</Review>

This time around the customer service was closer to average compared to the last time as more follow up with them needed to be done. Job took a few days; tech was on time first day. Pricey, but we trust it. Not all issues were resolved as a result of repairs like we thought but all and all a good job was done by Jimmy. Both Randy and Jimmy are easy to work with.< /Text>

<Text>I called about a toilet clog & kitchen faucet installation service Dec. 7 in AM, and was told a technician would come the same day. No show Dec. 7, but told a technician would come the next day Dec. 8. No show again and told a technician would come Dec. 10 at some time to be determined. A plumber did arrive in the early afternoon. The estimate to install a kitchen faucet was an exorbitant amount of $430. I declined work due to excessive price and the unreasonable delay in getting a technician out.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Confusion on the time they would show up.  When they tell you sending it over to dispatch at 9:30 doesn’t mean they are coming to your house at 9:30.  Clarify when your on the phone your appt time.  I took the day off waiting and they didn’t come until the next day.  Once they arrived they did a great job kind polite and follow up call right after.  I will use them again.</Text>

The water heater's pilot would not stay lit. The technician diagnosed the problem and contacted the manufacturer for me, as the water heater was under warranty. The parts arrived 2 days later and the technician installed them the same day.  Very professional and efficient.< /review>

Still have smell from sink and shower.. The  2nd tech that came right away knew what where the smell in the kitchen sink was coming from. Replaced a hose and the smell went away. They had to come out a total of 4 times for an issue that could have been fixed on the 1st call had they listened to our request.

His disposition seemed to change once he got into the house.  He seemed to be judging us and our house because we are poor and on a fixed income and can not afford nice things. I saw the guy looking around and making faces at our stuff.  I didn't say anything because I thought it was going to end there and I was used to people judging our stuff, which isn't a big deal.

We had 2 of our 3 dogs in a training crate so they wouldn't jump on the guy and knock him down.  He used the word "cage" when he saw them and we corrected him.  I could tell he was judging us, even after we had already explained it to him we did not want them knocking him down and that we had just put them in the crate once we heard the knock on the door.  They are spoiled and well fed, so I had hoped he would have seen that and let it go at that.  He proceded to make rude comments and noises about our house and asked if something on the back of our sons' toilet was pee.  I said I did not know (because it was the toilet our autistic son uses and he sometimes might miss) and hoped he saw embarrassment and humiliation on my face from his comment.  By this point I thought he was just being rude and hostile.  I guess he didn't see the look on my face because he kept going.
The dogs were still barking from a stranger being in the house.  I just walked away from him, told him I was putting and put all the dogs outside so I could hear what he had to say.  I figured he was having a bad day, so I tried to let it go.  I just wanted this over at this point so he could leave.  He quoted us some astronomical price for fixing a running toilet in our bathroom, I thanked him and thought that was the end, but it wasn't.  I figured he just made up the high price because he didnt want to do the work, which was fine by me because I wanted him gone by that time.  I never made faces or said anything to him because I thought he was taking his bad day out on us, but I really felt humiliated and embarrassed.  I was so ready to let it go and move on with my life

It didnt end there though:  About an hour later, we get a knock on the door from Animal Control about how our dogs were in a "cage" all day long, which is not true, and that the lady had to see them and take a picture of them and write up a report!  We have never been so embarrassed and humiliated in all our lives.
We are NEVER using Dutton Plumbing again!  I AM LIVID THAT HE EMBARRASSED US LIKE THAT!  HE WAS UNPROFESSIONAL AND RUDE!  I was trying to let it go, but now I can't.

Never hire this company!  Never!  I could understand if our dogs were emaciated or mangy looking, which they weren't so I dont know why the guy called Animal Control on us!   Our dogs are well taken care of!  Smh!  I  Now, I wish I had said something and kicked him out for being so rude!  Now, there's a report about our dogs on file with Animal Control!  Thanks Dutton Plumbing! I don't know why they hire plumbers like that because he's not people friendly!  I'm calling Corporate on Monday.  I dont care if it is close to Christmas.</Text>< Pics>

Dutton showed up at the top of my Google search and I decided to give them a try.  They were simply outstanding from the start and were constantly in touch with updates.   Their rep showed up that day and immediately diagnosed the problem, quoted prices for several options and, when the replacement part was from an old outdated fixture, drove 20 miles to find it and came back the next morning to finish the job.  He was courteous, professional and extremely polite.  The price was very competitive.  I would add that the last time I had need of a plumber, I called the so-called "smell good" guys and I felt ripped off.  The $99 drain clog turned into a $1,000 replacement project.  I highly recommend Dutton Plumbing.< /Review>

<user>113260468939692711446<//user><Review>We had a major pipe break and Dutton showed showed up within a few hours. Jay was wonderful and tried his best to snake it, but our pipes are 60+ years old and it was time for the big fix. They made things as comfortable as they could over the next few days as they replaced our pipe, while doing so they found a gas leak and they just took care of everything, calling the gas company and staying through it all.  All of the people were so friendly and competent. We appreciated it all</Review>< Rating>

<Text>Called Dutton Plumbing the Plumber for leaking pipe under the slab, excellent response time professional appearance needed it fixed or replaced, new pipe. Price quote was fixed too high Dutton Plumbing quoted over four thousand dollars to repair with new by pass pipe.

$20K+ estimate job cost to $1,250.
We were referred to Dutton Plumbing by our home warranty to fix our gas leak issue on our property. They came in the next day of our supposed schedule. We paid them $3,110 for them to detect the leak and fix it, after that they weren't able to fix it and told us we need to have a gas line repiping so they gave us an additional quote costing  $20k and may go higher if they need to open the drywalls, we were shocked and asked our friends from construction. We showed them the receipt and the quote and they told us we are getting scammed, they were so heartbroken that people like these exist, we found out stuff like 3pcs shut-off valves we paid for $1,200+ which only costs $25 each etc.. They did their best to find us trustworthy plumbing and referred us to Gordon Taylor Plumbing and long story short, they fixed the whole thing for ONLY $1,250.

Lessons learned... DON'T GET SCAMMED BY THESE SWINDLERS.</Review>

Dutton is one of the best plumbing services I’ve dealt with. In particular, their service technicians Ryan Johnson is excellent.  He’s friendly, professional, and thorough.  Always takes the time to make sure I understand the work performed and answers all my questions.  Best plumber in Ventura county for sure!</review>

Had a serious plumbing emergency causing approximately $70,000 in damages.  Dutton Plumbing kept moving our appointment back.  They jacked us around for 36 hours than wanted to schedule us for Thursday when we had called on a Monday and they missed 2 appointments.

JUST CALL ANYONE ELSE and certainly don’t send them to your Mom’s house as their advertising tag line suggests.  Read their reviews on Google and Yelp.  They speak for themselves, that is the one from real customers.< /Text>

<text>They scheduled me same day service, and Jay was prompt and professional. I was sent a photo of him prior to his arrival, so even though I was home alone with my two children, I felt safe opening the door to him. He completed the job in a timely fashion, even with my four year old shadowing him. He was patient and friendly with my son, which I appreciated very much. Our drains were all serviced well.</text>< UserId.>

Ryan was very helpful and explained the process well. The office team was very helpful with updates and helping us get the most up to date information. I would recommend Dutton Plumbing to anyone who may need plumbing services.</review>

But he didnt leave without advice and awareness of the pipes we have, and what we should do in the near future. He kept his word, and the sevice was no charge since the clog was not removed.

Eric N. was an absolute professional and extremely knowledgeable.  He not only resolved the issue we called for within a couple minutes of arrival, but also assisted and resolved several other minor issues that had been pestering us for quite some time.  Eric is by far the best we’ve seen and would happily go back to this company just for his services.  Really outstanding!</Review>

Friday Dutton Plumbing came to clear residential sanitary sewer line for $73.  Once technician arrived the cost went to $297 to remove toilet & snake & run camera through line. Dutton cleared blockage than called to tell me no guarantee toilet will not backup because existing line is corroded & to replace would cost $10K to $11K. Saturday night 8PM & again @ 2AM animals heard fighting under house. Found screens to crawl space under house not reinstalled. We were not expecting & are disappointed with this service call from Dutton.< /Review>

I really appreciate the quick response. Within maybe an hour of my phone call they had the camera in the main drain. Both Randy and William were very professional. Unfortunately they couldn't get to my other plumbing issue/question due to my tenant. I might have to have them return.</Text>

Great customer service from Dutton Plumbing! I used the chat option at 5:30 am when our shower backed up. The person was very helpful, letting me know I could expect a call from the office first thing. The office called promptly after opening letting me know we were going to get on the schedule for that day and they would call back with updates throughout the morning. I really appreciated that kind of service!
When the crew arrived they were polite, communicated well, and were efficent at their job. They were mindful of keeping the house clean as they came and went.
They provided great service at very reasonable price. I cannot say enough about how impressed and pleased we were with the whole experience. Thanks Dutton!!< /text>

Nobody likes to call the plumber because they know that the plumbing is going to empty in their bank account.

But Dutton takes care of all of that you’ll find it it’s actually not the price it’s the value that you get that makes the money were spending not only are they friendly they’re actually on time… In LA that’s something that literally never happens even if you have a genie in a jar.

COLE showed up exactly on time he was able to diagnose your problem we live in an old house and it takes a lot of work within five minutes he was able to show us everything working through the work that was done and start right away

It didn’t even take him 25 minutes because he had the right tools the right experience it’s probably one of the friendliest plumbers I met seriously don’t worry about price that’s for shoppers value that’s for True customers and that’s what you when you get from Dutton desire  to be a good customer value is worth it.</Text>

<review>Dutton Plumbing was great to work with, they continuously kept in contact with us on when a technician would be available. Mark M. came to the rescue! He was so friendly and great to work with. When our sink wouldn't drain the first time he went above and beyond to get it unclogged. Couldn't have asked for a better experience and will definitely be asking for Mark M. again for any future plumbing needs.</review></record>

<Review>5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ My first experience with Dutton I was a little nervous getting a plumber in a new city. We just bought our home a few months ago. My sister had used this company and spoke highly of them. I called this morning, they let me know they would be there at a time within an hour window. They texted, emailed and called to confirm with a picture of our Service person. His name is Mark M. He was very professional, clean, and respectful. He listened to my concerns, told me what he thought was going on. Let me know what he was going to do and finished in a timely manner as well. I could not believe how clean he was with the service. He brought a rug, covered his shoes and actually cleaned around my toilet when he was finished. I give the company an A + and Mark gets and A+ too! I am so happy and we now have a new plumber. We can actually ask for the same person again too. The price was great too! Thank you Mark M. And Dutton Plumbing!< /Review><user>108121908138114490547< /user><Date>1570741755674< /Date>< username>

<review>Outrageous quotes! Having friendly, punctual plumbers does not excuse price gouging. You should be embarrassed to claim being a company people can trust to send to their mothers!!!!!!
As a large company with so many clients and service calls, you are able to charge LESS than the other local one-man show plumbing services, but instead you instruct your plumbers to take advantage of people.
Such a ridiculous difference, trying to charge me $2400 for the same job another plumber was able to do for $600... Shame on you for taking advantage of a law enforcement family. I’d bet had my husband been home to deal with your plumbers, the quote would have been much less...  SMH.
ZERO STARS and I’ll be sharing this review on any social media and review sites available. What goes around comes around apparently 😉 Cheers!< /review><GmapID>0x80e82ebed5b30749:0x6a99858c7f6e0140</GmapID>< username>

<review>This company has just charged my 82 year old mother in law $5100 to replace some leaking pipes and shower mixer in her bathroom. It took just 1 day to complete the work. Included in the price was a charge for over $600 just to test that the work they carried out didn't leak. I am working in London so I spoke to Robert on the phone about the job, he tried to tell me that a length of copper pipe cost $50 when it cost less than $10.

They have quoted $28,000 to replace the rest of the pipework. I have been in the construction industry for over 30 years and have NEVER heard of such prices. They’re not even repairing the drywall that they cut away in the price as the home insurance company are doing that.< /review>< Pics>

They do good work if they manage to make it as per promised schedule. My biggest problem is I can't get them on short notice. They string me along for days. They need more than a week leeway to give me confirmed appointment.<//text>

OUTSTANDING. He  was complete in everything he did, was personable, most professional, and made certain of quality work in every detail of the step-by-step process in replacing 2-faucets. Having had 4-years experience as a plumber’s helper, I fully understood the difficulties involved in this bathroom upgrade. Throughout the work effort, Eric was congenial and thorough. I look forward to again working with him on other upcoming home improvement projects. Dutton has been our preferred plumbing company for years and that TRUSTED choice has been re-enforced by this recent experience.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>By doing some work at the house my water pipe started leaking in my garage.
Called Dutton very early in the morning and was greed by a very nice female (sorry missed her name). After explaining  the situation and scheduling  an approximate time for the technician  to arrive they guy appear about right on time.

I knew who I was expecting  because they even send you a picture of the person who will do the job.

Long story short, Eric  was amazing, he not only explained all (I have some skills so I know he was not bluffing) and did the job how I wanted. He even made some recommendations  (not trying to sell because I know that what he was saying I had it in written by the inspector) so good for him in terms of knowledge.

I believe that price is a bit on the high end compared to others, but you cannot put a price on things that you cannot ddo on your ownri and you have no good references
on other people.

My problem was fixed, my wife is happy and I can recommend  Dutton plumbing eyes closed.< /Text>< Pictures>

Nice people on the phone, but they kept rescheduling me to the next day. I re-arranged my schedule each day just to be told that they couldn't get to me that day and couldn't guarantee me a time the following day either. They had such good reviews and one of their sayings says, "we can be there in 60 minutes", that is not the case unfortunately.</review>

Adam was very professional and explained everything in detail what type of work was to be performed. Work was completed in a reasonable time frame and he even cleaned up my shelf under the kitchen sink. Thanks Adam!

Juan Carlos said he would take care of us when he first arrived at our house. He did exactly that. I have only dealt with him mostly but everyone involved with our plumbing have been great. They told me what they were going to do and they did it far above my expectations. I will absolutely recommend Dutton Plumbing to everyone. Job well done Carlos. Thank you.</text>

<text>There should be a minus rating

I was looking to have a shower toilet and sink Installed

First they try to lock you in with a 39 dollar deposit and says it will go to the bill
Nope I didn’t pay it
The guy came over and gave me a price of 16,000

For a brass valve they wanted to charge me 500 dollars

And the same valve was at Home Depot for 10 dollars

Can you believe that !

Please don’t hire these guys unless you like wasting money 💰< /text>< time>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Had a great experience with Randy from Dutton Plumbing today. He arrived right when they said he would, and looked clean and professional. (as they advertise). This is the only plumber I've ever had that took the time to stop at the door and put booties over his shoes, and went above and beyond explaining things and even giving me tips on how I could clean and maintain a leaky shower valve to prevent it from having issues in the future. Normally I dread calling for a plumber, but I would not hesitate to call Dutton again in the future for our plumbing needs.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<review>The team of Ken G., Caleb H., and Juan Carlos R. were very helpful, professional, and friendly. We were kept informed on the progress each day while each of the workmen were very polite to my wife and I when we asked questions.
In addition, Caleb Hernandez and Martin Hernandez, who worked on the plumbing of the drain line, the concrete patch,  and the restoration of the brickwork on the driveway planter displayed master workmanship and professionalism.
Juan Carlos Rodriguez, the lead technician,  was a re-assuring presence each time he visited the work site. He made sure we were getting the service we were paying for and were satisfied with the results.

Special thanks to Bernardo, Guillermo, and Jonathan for their work as the installation crew.
We are very happy with the results of the work of ALL the members of Dutton Plumbing.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1564594933940, 'text': 'Earl, Thank you so much for your 5 star review.

I made an appointment on a Thursday for them to come out on a Saturday when I would be off from work to do a non-urgent repair to a kitchen sink. First they called and said they would be late, then called back at the 11th hour to say that they were too busy and wouldn't be able to be there until Monday or Tuesday the following week.  AAA Plumbing came out in 45 minutes and started work immediately.< /Text>

This is a professional business providing quality product and service.  Cole, our installer, was exceptional:  knowledgable, great communicator, thorough, friendly with a wonderful sense of humor.  We highly recommend Dutton Plumbing.  In their case, you DO get what you pay for.  We interviewed several water service businesses and Dutton is the only one offering whole house softening/filtering.  The other services didn't know or didn't want to address this.  NO salt, which can eventually damage pipes.  Preserves appliances and stops mineral buildup.  Water tastes great and our little dogs can drink from the hose--and it's much better fot the plants.< /Text>

First I want to thank  the Dutton hiring people for their selection in hiring professional and highly qualified personnel as field service representatives for Dutton Plumbing.. These two gentlemen, Richard M and William G. were at my home on 3/14/2019 to review and fix my plumbing issues. I took them through my home and gave them a review of the issues that I had concerns over and they also looked at my Hot water heater. They found issues with the Hot water Heater which I didn't know about.  They took care of all of my issues and performed their work in a professional manner. A real pleasure in doing business with people like this.</Review>

<text>I can’t say enough about how great Dutton Plumbing is and there team especially during this time with the Covid-19. My plumber showed up wearing a mask, gloves and booties without me even having to ask. Lauro & Steve  were very pleasant and knowledgeable. This was a great experience from the beginning to end. Lauro was able to fix my problem quickly with my washer machine valves leaking behind the walls.  5 stars all the way!< /text><gmapID>0x80e82ebed5b30749:0x6a99858c7f6e0140< /gmapID><user_name>Christine N.

Quick and very clean. Also sought out least expensive way to resolve a problem. I haven’t had many plumbing problems, mostly just hired to change out fixtures. So I have little to compare to as far as costs are concerned. But he was clearly more knowledgeable than a well known plumbing company I used on my house in Pacific Palisades. Price was in high end of my ballpark estimate, but I always seem to underestimate costs. And based on man hours they were far less expensive work I had done for replacing a sewer pipe 2 years ago. Also, all options were explained in advance as well as pricing.  I would recommend Ryan K, the service advisor, without reservation.<//Review>

<text>Well yesterday after I left work I get a call from my employees that the men’s toilet is overflowing and leaking water all over the floor.
So we called Dutton Plumbing in the morning and they had there plumber come out at 2:00 pm to fix.
He has to remove the toilet to drain because it wasn’t going down with the regular equipment auger tool. He had to get the big guns out and finally cleared the drain and put everything back to normal.
Thank You Eric Dutton and Thanks to your awesome staff of people at Dutton Plumbing !

Oh yeah it was only 73.00 to clear the drain wow what a deal I owe you guys pizza for sure !< /text>< response>

Secondly, the technician, David W. was great. He detailed what needed to be done, offered advice and finally offered alternatives to the water heater.  He was a professional. Its fantastic to deal with such a customer focused company. I would not hesitate to recommend Dutton Plumbing.
I've already posted this upper part, but now that the work is done, I can't praise this company and David W. enough. David has a superior work ethic, is easy to talk to, very nice and kept me up to date on the progress. He kept the area clean and was nice enough to wait for me to do some work, so that he could continue, which is a rarity these days. If I could give the company 6 stars, I would.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1545410430101, 'text': 'Greg, Thank you so much for your 5 star review.

I had a broken water pipe inside the wall between the hall bath and one of the back bedrooms. I called and had a plumber out to my location within hours.  They sent a photo of the workman, a clean cut, respectful young man who wore booties over his shoes inside the house, covered the rug and cleaned up ... complete with an industrial vacuum when he was finished. I was provided with a 4 page document that included a detailed account of the work.  I couldn't be more satisfied.< /review>< Pics>

< Review>
Had a great experience with Dutton Plumbing.  Our technician Brandon helped get our water heater back up and running on a Saturday afternoon. It looked like we might need a new water heater but he diligently worked to troubleshoot and fix the non-standard problem with our heater.  Our heater is back up and running thanks to his diligence!   Great service at a very reasonable price!<//Review>

< Review>
Brandon put in a new water heater for us. Throughout the entire process he was pleasant, informative and professional. He explained options, prices and answered all questions we put to him. He completed a relatively lengthy task in one afternoon.  Our home is on a hill and the water heater space is tucked into a small room in the middle of a rambling home layout. His work was flawless. He kept the work area clean and picked up/swept the area after he was done. Easily a 5 star rating. Great job.</Review>

We contacted Dutton Plumbing to install/repair various things in our Kitchen.  Michael was a great worker, on time, worked with us to install various pieces we had purchased and honestly explained what gone wrong with repairs from prior plumbers.  We added items to our original repair list due to his professionalism.
This is the second time using Dutton Plumbing and we will use them again for our next plumbing needs.< /review>

<review>Bernardo was a member of the team from Dutton Plumbing who installed a sleeve around our plumbing line from our home to the city sewer connection.  Bernardo worked consistently hard and diligently on a hot day.  He was polite, took pride in doing a good job and completed  job with his crew in one day.  He left our front yard exactly as he found it.  he obviously had pride in his work.  We were pleased at the end of the day and impressed with the professionalism.<//review>< user_id>

<review>Great communication with Dutton Plumbing.  I had a tech here in about an hour. The ladies at the office kept me informed on scheduling. Their tech Jaiyro was right on time, did a professional job and even educated me on some plumbing concerns. There pricing is upfront and I did not get the up sell treatment.
I have in the past used  another plumbing company here in Simi . I had a very bad experience with them and will now use only Dutton.
I would definitely recommend Dutton to anyone.<//review><name>Marianne Neininger<//name>< userid>

We've had a really good couple of experiences with Dutton. They are very prompt, and give great time frames and quick service. Our plumber was Eric and he was above and beyond for kindness and knowledge. We bought the membership for a year because we knew we liked them enough (and it's our first year in this house so we're expecting issues to come up). Overall a really great company.</review>

Rick came out to do a home inspection. He was very professional, knowledgeable and very thorough. He not only listed each item that
required attention but also showed us its location. He was careful to
make sure he didn't left any messes. I especially liked that he prioritized
needed repairs and gave us options on prices to help us with budgeting for the repairs.</text>

Contacted Dutton Plumbing today to inquire about Tank less Water Heaters. I certainly got lucky when this Marvelously Sweet person named KAYLA answered the phone asked me if I would like a technician to come out TODAY for estimation and explanation, of course I did.

Well let me say straightaway that I was floored by RANDY ARNOLD, his pleasantly enthusiastic demeanor was well just Awesome. Not at all the crusty plumber who was wishing the day was over and had to be at my house. no not at all, RANDY ARNOLD spent an extensive period of time explaining the technology behind the unit as well as the actual labor and materials that would be required (may I add using terms that made me feel comfortable about the procedure). RANDY ARNOLD asked me often if I was understanding it and if I was still feeling comfortable about making the change. Wow if only the guy at the dealership was that enthusiastically compassionate about selling me a car.

RANDY ARNOLD also mentioned the Family Service Plan for a Lifetime which I jumped all over with great joy. He completely described ALL of the facets and services that accompany the plan. Sold, Sold, Sold.
What a great idea a preventive maintenance plan for my home plumbing needs.

All in All, Yes we have decided to purchase the unit from Dutton Plumbing as well as the Family Service Plan. We are looking at installation as soon as next week, of course RANDY ARNOLD will be our technician with Dutton for as long as he is associated and look forward to his Smiling Face in our Place.

Thank You very much for Your time today Randy, it was a real pleasure meeting you.

Thank You very much Dutton for having RANDY ARNOLD on your staff and allowing us to benefit from his expertise and just plain niceness.

They arrived even before the stated time, were polite and professional, and really took the time to explain what had been a frustrating (and water-logged) situation.  They went the extra mile in checking the drainage of my dishwasher and cleared a blockage.  I highly recommend these gentlemen and Dutton Plumbing!</Text><UserId.>115222442576437974068<//UserId.>< Date>

<gmap_id>0x80e82ebed5b30749:0x6a99858c7f6e0140<//gmap_id><text>Adam Alvarez provided exceptional service! He is friendly, easy to talk to, very knowledgeable and is concerned about the customer’s problem along with a determination to fix whatever is wrong. Adam worked hard and kept in touch the whole time. He conducted himself in a professional manner and answered all my questions by explaining what I wanted to know. Furthermore, I feel that Adam is a very good PR person for Dutton Plumbing and definitely an asset to the company.

Other Dutton field technicians who helped do the repiping job: Miguel V., Ricardo and Edgar. Miguel, who was managing the job itself, kept me well informed about their progress and did a great job. I didn’t have occasion to get to know Ricardo or Edgar very well, but they worked very hard and displayed integrity in what they were doing. I really appreciated their efforts because the quick results speak for themselves.

Overall, I am pleased with the rapidity of the job and the results. I now have peace of mind that I won’t continue to be plagued with recurring drain blockages as I have in the past. I would recommend Dutton Plumbing without reservation to anyone needing a reliable high quality company to get their plumbing or rooter needs taken care of. Thanks for a job well done Dutton!</text><Resp>{'time': 1517586208365, 'text': "Good morning John! we are ecstatic that you've received such an incredible experience with us :) Adam is, as you've stated, and incredible asset to our team, and we're proud to send him to our customers' homes!

<review>I was impressed by the manners and efficiency of the scheduling staff. Not only did I receive a very fast appointment, before the plumber arrived, I was sent his employment ID that included a photograph.
The service was thoroughly explained and other services introduced. The plumbing issue was resolved to my satisfaction. Eric did a terrific job, very efficient and polite.  I would recommenced this company.<//review>< rate>

<review>Dutton Plumbing made for a pleasant and efficient solution to my household problem. My call was answered by a charming person whose name I’d do injustice to if I tried to spell it. Joe, a nice, professional dispatcher called promptly with the name of a technician who would arrive at my home within an hour. The technician, Ryan, arrived on time and made short work of my problem.</review>< Response>

Highly recommend Dutton Plumbing. I called on a Friday morning thinking I'd have to wait a few days for appointment, I was amazed to receive same day service! Ryan  arrived and was polite and courteous. He knew exactly what the problem was and shared what he was going to do and did it. Mission accomplished. I will continue to call Dutton plumbing for any plumbing needs in the future.< /text>

I just want to take this opportunity to thank the Dutton Plumbing gentlemen JAMES and WILLIAM who were out to my home to replace the main house water shut valve.  I am disabled and in an electric wheelchair.  They were prompt, helpful, accomodating and so very friendly.  As with all plumbers the price was high but they showed me several options to facilitate payment.  I strongly recommend Dutton Plumbing as your service provider for any and all your plumbing needs.</text>

I had a huge drain pipe issue and an emergency health issue for a family member simultaneously - 5 days before Christmas. I needed  a company that could proactively handle my emergency plumbing issues quickly and professionally. Bottom line: An estimated 3 day job took a little over 1 day for the Dutton "A Team" to complete and the Christmas feast didn't have to be cancelled. Overall, communication was great throughout. Thanks Dutton guys and gals!< /Text>

Cole was very thorough in his review of my problem and searching through four other problems and suddenly discovered the source of a leak which was very troublesome. Following his excellent discovery we solve a major source of expense that appeared on my water bill for which I’m very appreciative. We solve the problem this I’ve been plagued with For a long time.  He was very professional in his approach and thoroughly explained all the options that were available to me. As a representative of dirt and plumbing I would highly recommend him to anyone who has plumbing problems<//text>

Almost immediately I had a text update, with a picture and name of my service provider to be expected (which is great for those that are unsure of who to expect coming into your home).  When he arriveded he immediately put on booties to keep my floor clean (which is bonus points, because I just mopped), he listened to my issues with the garbage disposal and sink, gave me advice on how to keep this from happening again (as well as what to expect), and fixed it in less than 5 minutes!
We'll be a returning customer for our future needs (just hopefully not anytime soon)!< /Review>< pictures>

Dutton Plumbing has superior craftsmen for all Your needs. Noe A. & his brother came to do all the stucco finish work. He is excellent at what he does. Noe is friendly, happy & always laughing as he works along side his brother. We are very pleased with the work they did for us & they went beyond the work that was required.< /review>

Outstanding service, Leo the technician came and fixed our clogged that I could not fix myself. He gave me some tips to maintain the pipe clean, while he was working on my kitchen sink issue. Honestly, this is one of the best service I have had in awhile.
KEEP UP THE BEST SERVICE!!!
Will definitely call this company again if any issue arises.

Thomas was extremely professional and so helpful. He did a great job servicing my toilet , but he went above and beyond and answered a lot of questions.

<review>Mark was awesome. Very professional and friendly. They put on shoe covers to ensure the floor was kept clean and before snaking out the kitchen drain prepped to ensure nothing got dirty during the process. Everything went pretty quick and when he was done told me if the clog comes back in 90 days he would come fix it for free. Would definitely recommend.<//review>< time>

We had exemplary experience with Adam Alvarez the service professional from Dutton Plumbing.  He was very knowledgeable about his trade and answered all our questions to our satisfaction.  Adam took care of the drainage problem from the problematic second floor and left the area clean and tidy.  We highly recommend Adam take care of any plumbing needs you may have.  We sure will call Dutton again if needed.</Review>

Amazing. Will use again if needed. I used the CHAT service on their webpage. It was a call center, but, I shortly received a call from Tania at the company. She explained it was a Sunday, and had one driver handling emergencies. She let me know that I would be in the queue and she would keep me updated. First appointment was 1100 am. I received a call postponing it to 200 pm. Shortly after, they called back and said Randy was on his way. He arrived a 11:15, well within when he was expected.

Randy was personal and professional. He was clean and polite. We were even able to make small talk without distracting his work. Not only was the visit quick, but no shady upset tactics. I paid $73,00 as advertised. He had to cut tree roots out of a line outside of the house with one of his tools. Not only did I get great service, I received great value.

With any other company, I would have paid 2-3 times what he charged.< /Review>

Impressed with Marc's professionalism and customer service.  He  was knowledgeable and friendly, He took the time to answer our questions and explain everything to us. He worked hard and we would  recommend him our friends. Thank you Marc!

Thomas was working with Marc when they came to our house. They were a great team and seemed to work well together. Thomas did a great job too! Thanks Thomas!</Text>

yesterday I was referred by a friend to Dutton as i lost the contact information to my Plumber i used for the last few years and could not find a business card. I was very impressed with the office staff. Very professional and friendly. I think his name was James and his coworker were very knowledgeable about the issue with my tank-less water heater. I would definitely recommend Dutton plumbing again, they saved me from cold showers in the morning.<//Review>

<Review>Dutton plumbing was able to get out to our house the same day we called after discovering our hot water heater wasn’t working.  Everyone on the phone was helpful and professional.  The technician (Kyle) they sent arrived on time.  Kyle was very knowledgeable as well as friendly and professional.  Kyle diagnosed the issue quickly and provided several options and a recommendation based on his experience. We will be sure to call Dutton in the future and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them to friends.</Review>< pics>

<Text>I am a caregiver for a client who lives in a senior community. My client called me in distress because both toilets and shower in his condo had backed up. I arrived in less than half an hour and Ray jr. G arrived 5 minutes after me. He was friendly, knowledgeable, handsome and worked fast! I thought, Wow! This guy gets handsomer and handsomer as he finishes the job in under 20 minutes. He did his thing and i was able to get in and clean up so my client and his wife could safely use the bathroom with no slip, trip or falls. This guy was great. When I asked him for his card so I could recommend this company to my friends, clients or whomever may need plumbing services, he asked that I leave him a review. I said I absolutely would. Once again... I thought this guy, this outfit, was fabulous.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

David came out to repair our water heater. He arrived less than 2 hours after we called. He explained the process and costs. While it turned out to be the more expensive problem of the two he described, I wasn't surprised by the increased cost. He did the work quickly and within about 45 minutes our water heater was working. He was professional and very pleasant.< /Text>

Randy Arnold is a consummate professional who did an outstanding exploring, analyzing, and addressing the myriad of plumbing issues going on in my home.  Randy suggested ways to repair areas/parts that I plan to address in the very near future to keep the plumbing in my home optimized during use.  I couldn’t be more pleased with his knowledge, professionalism, diligence, focused attention, kind and friendly  demeanor-and commitment to getting the job done.  I highly recommend Dutton Plumbing for your plumbing needs, especially Randy Arnold who I will personally request for my next job!

Dutton staff are beyond professional - they are courteous and attentive, kind and polite. They treat you and your home with respect, using abundant covers to avoid tracking dirt and vacuums to minimize dust.  You get text  and images of the workers to ID who's coming to your house. I can't speak to value, because I didn't bother getting bids from other plumbers.  I will say that it's common to over-promise, and under-deliver in home repair (  workers "discover unexpected issues" that drive up costs and prolong repairs).  James advised us the work might take 3-10 days, but the Dutton crew did the work in 2 with no additional charges or up-sells. They addressed all our concerns regarding disturbing cabinetry and explained options and financing clearly.   If you got old pipes, call these guys.<//text>

< Review>
We had a leak in the bathroom that caused wet spots under the rug a few feet away;  we also were interested in a water filtration system and a new waterless heater.  All of this took 5 days to complete and the techs never stopped working.  STEPHEN S. was our main tech;  we cannot say enough positive things about him.  He is very knowledgeable, professional, friendly and respectful of other's property.  I have never seen anyone work as steadily and quickly as STEPHEN S.;  we had Larry, Tony, Cole and others here during the week, however, STEPHEN S., was the one in charge and he is excellent at what he does!  Each day, everything was left spotless.  His patience and direction with other techs is a great asset, also.  Each Tech that was here deserve praise, as they all knew what the were doing.  The Customer Service personnel are the best and we highly recommend STEPHEN S. and Dutton Plumbing.  Thanks, STEPHEN S.!< /Review>

<text>Juan R. And Cole were prompt, friendly, and courteous. Juan explained everything thoroughly and gave me options before he began. They came in last-minute and saved me from a weekend without a kitchen, even if that meant not having dinner until almost bedtime. I’d recommend them in a heartbeat, and I swear if Juan needed a kidney, I’d seriously consider being a donor.</text><rating>5</rating>< UserId.>

<Review>Took 3 separate visits over 4 days to fix our water heater. Forget trying to call them for "emergency service"--i.e. after regular business hours. They'll just send a notice to whoever's in the filed and hope for the best, without giving you any updates. Take your business elsewhere.</Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80e82ebed5b30749:0x6a99858c7f6e0140</Gmap_id></record>

Overall my experience with Dutton Plumbing was great from start  to finish. I called a day before regarding a pipe that was clogged and they were able to get someone out the very next day. The gentleman that came to the house was extremely nice and very helpful. Highly recommend this company for any of your plumbing needs!< /Review>

Mark came out and cleared out our drain in the front yard and took the call at the end of the day. I was so grateful to get this resolved quickly since the plumbing company I usually call was booked up for the evening and would not be able to help till tomorrow. He greeted me with a smile and a handshake and in less than 30 minutes he had it cleared. In the meantime I think we got to know each other pretty well in that his great personality kept a conversation going through the process and I know I have found myself a new plumbing company! Great personality, great attitude and cost almost 25% less than my former plumbing company.< /Review>

I have used Mark M. several times over the years. He's smart as a whip, knows how to do any job. I wouldn't use anyone else. He is articulate, knowledgeable, handles job quickly & efficiently and is the cleanest worker! It's as clean when he is finished as when he started! Terrific guy, well mannered and very friendly!

<Review>Could not have asked for better care from the team and workers.  They were very good at explaining what needed doing and keeping me informed as to what they were doing.  There clean up when finished working was also great.  They are so friendlly, kind and helpful as well as good workers. Will definitely use them for all plumbing.</Review>< Pics>

<review>Greg B is by far the BEST plumber I have ever worked with. Due to my plumbing problem my neighbor shut off all my water on a Friday night. I called Dutton on Saturday as I had heard they were the best company.
Greg arrived around 5 and didn’t leave til after 9.
Unfortunately my problem was not easily fixable through no fault of Gregs. HOWEVER, Greg did a temporary fix so I could have my water on for the rest of the weekend.  Greg came back on Monday and finished the job!!! I cannot recommend Greg enough. He is very kind and considerate! As important he is very experienced and obviously he knows exactly what he is doing. If I have plumbing problems in the future I want Greg to do the work!!</review>< pictures>

The field rep Eric N was fantastic. He was polite, professional and resolved a very minor problem quickly and easily. Although the problem was in fact minor, other companies not only missed the problem, but caused the problem. He noticed it immediately! We should have called Dutton first.< /review>

I am writing this review specifically about Randy Arnold, Technician for Dutton Plumbing. Randy came to my home today to perform a warranty-based replacement of my water heater's burner assembly and gas/temperature controller. Another Dutton Tech installed the water heater 4 yrs ago so it was still under warranty. Randy performed all the work in a very timely and excellent manner, and he was extremely informative every step of the way, and he was a really nice guy to boot. He answered all of my many questions and taught me a few additional things along the way. I highly recommend Randy.<//text>

We have used Dutton Plumbing for several years at Santa Paula Animal Rescue Center and every time we have needed their assistance, they've been there, quickly and their service has always been outstanding!
Due to our needs, they have to visit us often and one of the plumbers even adopted a dog from us, who gets to go to work with him every day!  We are so grateful to have Dutton Plumbing as our service provider, which also feels like part of our SPARC family!  Highly recommend their professionalism and quality of service!</Text>

<review>Was told I would be in the first round of service for the day, ended up being the last call of the night. I had to call at least three times and demand to speak to a manager before getting a plumber scheduled.

The plumber barely spent any time looking for my sewer clean out. When it was not plainly visible, he then charged me $39 to come out and recommend I schedule a minimum $400 service with someone else. Called management afterward and was told I should not have been charged and would get my money refunded.

To say I am very upset is an understatement. I will not be using them again because of their inattentive plumbers and unresponsive call center. The only silver lining was that the supervisors and managers were helpful in finally getting a plumber out and for refunding my money.< /review>< date>

We had Lon Ralson, Field Service Rep out for what we thought would be a minor plumbing repair but unfortunately, it turned into a bigger problem with old, galvanized piping.  No worries though, Lon explained what needed to be done and did a fantastic repair and clean-up job.  We appreciated his friendly, customer oriented service and attitude.   Thank you, Lon!< /Review>

Cole was very professional and polite. His explanation was quite clear and easy to understand. He really took his time doing the work and was always ok to stop and answer any questions my husband had. If I could give more than 5 stars I would. I have to say that Dutton was the best plumbing company I've had the pleasure to work with in years. If I ever need any other plumbing work done they are the only company I would call. Cole deserves high   kudos for how well he represented himself and his company.
Thank you for making a painful replacement of a water heater less painful

Not only did they have someone come out within one hour, but they emailed me information on the technician and sent an email confirmation and then a phone call to confirm.

<Text>Contacted Dutton on a Sunday for to look at an emergency water leak in the master bathroom. Diego was a pleasure to work with. He provided multiple options on how to proceed and was very collaborative in resolving the problem in the quickest fashion while his skills allowed the repair to be completed without having to remove any of new tile work which would have added significant cost and time to the repair project. Great work and would recall Dutton without hesitation.< /Text><user_name>Dave Johnson< /user_name><resp>{'time': 1511380659099, 'text': 'Dear Dave Johnson,\n\nWater leaks can be scary and stressful situations and we are so glad to hear we were able to remedy your plumbing emergency.

The work was perfect and exactly what Brad explained he needed to do in order to safely repair the problem.  I would recommend these guys to anyone.</review><gmapID>0x80e82ebed5b30749:0x6a99858c7f6e0140<//gmapID><Pics>None< /Pics><user_id>114071945588775843630<//user_id></record>

< Review>
Ric was awesome! He was very courteous and understanding of my situation having dealt with another "plumber" who left my kitchen plumbing in a shambles. He answered all my questions, thoroughly explained everything that needed to be done and completed the work efficiently. I chose Dutton  because I had dealt with them on one other occasion years ago. Needless to say, Dutton made a great impression back then and evidently, nothing has changed! It's never pleasant when plumbing issues arise but Dutton definitely makes it easy. From the customer service reps who took my calls and followed up with me to Ric, the knowledgeable and competent tech who got the job done. These are the people to call. Thanks again, Dutton!😊< /Review>

Great communication received a phone call to verify I was still needing a plumber, then a call to let me know what time Ken Jr  was going to be at my house.  Ken Jr was very friendly, professional and right time, within minutes he had my sink drain flowing again!  He gave me some great advice for preventing backups for next time & also ideas of what needs to be replaced in a few years to help maintain. Thank you Dutton Plumbing for the great service provided just like what the radio says.< /text>< Gmap_id>

Top notch service! The Dutton Plumbing crew is amazing!  We recently had a sewer connection problem in our front yard due to a poor installation made before we bought the home.  The problem came up with less than three days before we had an event at our home, expecting over 100 guests.  The Dutton crew came out, identified the problem, and began working on it within an hour.  They had to do a lot of digging (about 5 feet down!) to get to the problem.  My dad watched every step of the process from beginning to end.  They had to remove the offending connection, and then lined the existing old pipe with an epoxy liner, a major operation.  The three plumbers who worked on the job, Mark M, Juan Pablo, and Ricardo S were extremely proficient, answered every question my dad had, and even serviced other areas of the house plumbing so everything would be fully operational.  We cannot highly enough recommend Dutton Plumbing!< /text>

<Review>We had roots blocking the outside drains around our pool decking. Adam let us know his ETA which was very helpful. He was professional, courteous, knowledgeable and thorough in his explanation of the problem and the various solutions. He was up front on cost. He spent quite a lot of time snaking the multiple drains around the pool, pulling out the roots and when was finally done, I could see how well water now flows.  He was impeccable in his after job clean up. I would highly recommend Dutton Plumbing and would recommend asking for Adam who has been doing this for 31 yrs. If the whole team is as professional as Adam, this is a very good company.< /Review>< pictures>

I have had the privilege of calling them out to my home 2 times now and there service is unbelievable!!!  I had a small plumbing company that I had used for several years until I got tired of them ripping me off and them not standing behind their work. My last experience was with Dutton’s service pro Marc R  who came and located a problem that was a sprinkler pipe issue and he did not even charge me after spending a lot of time finding the issue. Marc did inform me and quoted me a price that my house does not have a pressure regulator. Installing one will help to not create other issues with other things like toilets, facets etc in the future. I am making an appointment for that today.
Marc R was so professional and kind and had such a “CAN DO” attitude. It was very refreshing and Dutton plumbing should be very proud to have him on their staff.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>Adam was very professional and courteous. He got the issue with our toilet solved by replacing the  deteriorating interior parts and made sure that the toilet water level was where it was suppose to be. He also checked the toilet  in our master bathroom, fixing  it so the water level was  correct, so it did not waste water as it was doing  before by running too long and not stopping where it should have.</review>< Time>

To the most important component, an excellent technician, Steven Vidaca.  He did not rush into the work but talked with me for a few minutes as we checked the other plumbing locations in my home and yard.  He handled the issues I had called about but found an area underneath my sink that had serious corrosion and would soon be causing me real problems.  Steven was thorough, technically sound and very professional.  His customer service was excellent.  I highly recommend Dutton Plumbing and Steven Vidaca.< /Review>< Pics>

This company is fantastic, true professionals.  Our home is 57-58 years old and the plumbing was crumbling.  Dutton gave us an estimate, helped us get financing (even through our own bank), and worked like energizer bunnies to get the job done rapidly.  Great crews, and great guys!  They are the BEST!</Review>

I used Dutton in Oct to repipe the house, and now needed to have bathroom drain pipes replaced. I specifically asked for Mark Ryder because is was the lead for when we had the repipe and knows the house. I feel that he is honest, explains things very well and in detail, and gives options, and is courteous. He’s a great plumber and really knows his stuff.
I would highly recommend Dutton.<//Text>

<Review>Quick and professional service. I had a really bad clog in my main pipe and called Dutton, on the phone I was immediately impressed with how they handled me as stressed as I was. I was treated as an important emergency and the plumber that came Ken G. couldn't have done better. He immediately reassured me and gave me advice on how to prevent this in the future. Thanks Dutton! You will hear from me in the future.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Kevin from Dutton really knocked it out of the park. He not only addressed the major issue that inspired us to call for service, but he identified other serious issues that would create problems for us down the road. Kevin and his crew were professional, courteous and kept our house clean, despite doing a lot of trenching in our front yard. They resolved our problems effectively and quickly.

< review>
Dutton seems to have the best prices around. $73 (as of this review date) for any simple drain clean (like the main four-inch line running from my house to the street - 70 feet). They are very well organized in that they keep you updated as to when the technician is coming and don't give you unrealistic expectations. The equipment that they used for my latest main line clog is top notch and they don't make a mess. Also, they have great communication skills.< /review>

Dutton was great. We called after hours, and they had someone over to the house within an hour. Dan was friendly, quick, and efficient. He was able to get our clog fixed with ease and made a frustrating situation much better. Thanks Dan and Dutton! We would use Dutton again.<//Text>

<text>I got a quote over the phone for $199 from Michael. When the plumber got here he gave me a quote of $549. This was to find a leak in a pipe that was in the dirt in about a 5' x 10' area. They were asking $549 to dig a hole to find a leaking pipe! Unbelievable! The quote I was given over the phone was for the same thing. The plumber said he would call the office. I watched him and he did not talk to anyone else. He came back to me and said $249. I told him to leave my property. These guys are scam artists so BEWARE!!!</text><Gmap_id>0x80e82ebed5b30749:0x6a99858c7f6e0140</Gmap_id><pictures>None< /pictures>< username>

i will NOT give less than a 5 star because of Jimmy the tech.

Jimmy was great.  He made every attempt to resolve the concern without giving up.  the tech was courteous, punctual and professional.

however, the only drawback were the 8 phone calls received from the office and call center.  redundant info such as confirming the address 6 times. the spelling of my name and will someone be there.

when i am at work, it was hard to stop work, drop my tool belt, reach in my pocket, take off my gloves to answer just to confirm information conveyed in the beginning.

this will not prevent me from using their services again, but hope this review will prompt them to review why they would overly ensure, with levels of certainty and continuous confirmations that the info they are requesting is as true the last time as it was the first time and every moment in between. (reading this review and typing it has the same effect--boring and monotonous).<//text>

I had a simple clog that couldn't be resolved with a bladder or consumer-grade auger. Heard good things about these guys from a friend, so I called. My call was answered by someone who spoke english, and was able to confirm a time to call me back to set an exact appointment time (same day). I didn't get a call back initially, so I called and rescheduled for the following day as I could not wait at home any longer. After that, smooth sailing. The dispatcher called me that next morning confirming a time, and then the repair man called me when he got there. He was cool enough to wait a few minutes for my fiance to get there. It took him 25 minutes to fix the clog and he was on his way. The price remained consistent, no surprises. This would have been 5 stars if I had initially gotten a call back like i was promised. However that being said, I would absolutely use these guys again.<//review>

The tech and his crew were friendly and extremely neat and clean when doing the job.  Always able to answer any questions we had.  Stayed long and late but finished in in a very quick time frame. Re-plumbed the entire property in two days.  My family and i are very pleased and would recommend them to everyone.  Very professional group of guys right down to the drywall work to close things up.
Hands down, excellent work.
The drywall guy that they employ, DREW, does immaculate work, and he is very fast also.  Many years of experience showed in his quality of workmanship< /Text>

<Review>First , I would like to thank a lot for the technician from Dutton Plumbing come to my house to estimate the job i want to do is replace Water pressure regulator . I did refuse to do it because  for me I think the estimate like all the way going to the Mars not the Moon .

Thanks for not charge me for fee for the time the technician travel to my house that i do not agree  the estimate.
And thanks for the professional Customer Service from  Dutton Plumbing to contact me before and on the day of the appointment , and the technician coming on time and very professional doing whatever he has to do with his job for the company.
( His Name : Steven Snyder )

Second ,  I would say Dutton Plumbing want to charge me around $600.00 to $750.00 ( six hundred dollars to seven hundred fifty dollars) from the initial estimate from the technician for the job to do is replace the Water Pressure Regulator  ( included Part and Labor ) .

Wow,wow .... my eye likes to see July 4 fireworks and winning lottery  . is it true like the technician told me ?

After the phone call back to the office from the technician to get the price from the boss is : ... $ 600.00 ( six hundred dollars )
I think that price ...... too much ... unbelieveable .

( Home Depot >> part cost for 3/4 inches around $90.00 to $150.00 )

Even the  Part is $200.00 , how can the labor cost  $400.00 for the job to do less than 1 hour . ( I think for the technician to do is less than 30 minutes )

Finally , I ask for $250.00 to $300.00 to do the job but Dutton Plumbing is not agree .

Ok , I do it myself , I went to Home Depot buy the Part included tax around $100.00 and went home to replace  less than 30 minutes. It's working good now.

Again ,  I think Dutton Plumbing , very professinal company with good review from the customer

..........please charge for the job done with a reasonable price .

I'm not sure I want to call back Dutton Plumbing for any Plumbing problem need to fix .

That my thought .

Sincerely,

Andrew<//Review><UserId.>107940135420318835440< /UserId.>< Rate>

Fantastic service!!   Two for two!!   Both times, problem was solved in a short time, very fair prices, and a fantastic in person experience!!  First visit was in 2017, for water pressure problems, and this visit today, was for a landscape drain blockage!!   Michael did a fantastic job today. And made sure I felt like my home Is protected from potential flooding, that almost happened last week with all the rain.

Thanks team Dutton!!    From friendly appointment setting, all the way through, to a follow up call, that happened before Michael had pulled away...< /Review>

< Review>
Brandon and Paul came out to provide a second opinion for us today. We had been quoted a suspiciously low price for a sewer reroute by another company, and we wanted to see what other expenses we might expect. The guys did a very thorough inspection of our pipes using roof vents and clean outs and a high quality camera. From there, they determined that we did not have an immediate need for a reroute (we had been told that there was sewage leaking under the house and we should move on the reroute the same day). They were responsive to our initial call, on time, friendly, clear communicators, straightforward about their pricing, and--most importantly--were honest to the point of not advising a huge job right away. They will keep our business because of it.< /Review>

The issue I was having proved to be challenging, but the tech providing service, Jimmy, was helpful, informative and willing to try multiple alternative solutions to help minimize the disruption in my house and to my day.

He explained everything thoroughly, was kind to my dogs, respectful of my home and fixed the problem very efficiently.  I'd recommend him and Dutton without hesitation.  We've done a great deal of remodeling, in four different houses so I've had lots of service technicians in our home.  My experience with Dutton stood out as being entirely positive.  It takes a good plumber to turn a plumbing emergency into a good experience and that's exactly what Jimmy from Dutton did.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>When my kitchen sink clogged, I tried everything to fix it myself... without any success. I dreaded calling a plumber because of a few poor experiences in the past, but I couldn't avoid it. I looked Dutton Plumbing up online because I had just heard one of their radio commercials. From the time I got to their website, everything about my experience with them was absolutely great! There's a lot of helpful information there, the phone number is easy to find, and one of the nicest features is their chat service where a real, live person is waiting to help you! Within a few minutes, I received a call from a friendly, efficient representative who answered my questions, took my information, and advised me that a technician would be arriving shortly. Next I received a text message and email to advise me of the approximate time of arrival, a picture and a brief bio of the tech who would doing the work for me... WOW! Jimmy arrived on time, he was very professional, friendly, polite, he explained everything to me, fixed the problem, and cleaned up as if he had never been here. After he left, I received a follow-up call from Dutton Plumbing to see how the service was! I'm totally blown away! These people really take good care of their customers... a rarity. I will definitely call them again if a problem arises. And if you ever need a plumber for anything, I highly recommend Dutton Plumbing. I think you'll be just as amazed and I am with the quality of their service!< /Review>< rating>

<Text>I had a plumbing problem in my shower 🚿 I heard the ad over the radio and had to think what’s the catch to the $73 drain cleaning or it’s free, what’s this going to set me back after they do the work ? To my surprise that’s all it was $73 and it was done and Edger that came was the same one the operator said who it was going to be and even on time 🤗 but what I thought was even more so that he was very nice and explained everything and he even has slip covers for his shoes I’ve never had any kind of plumbing experience like this , my landlord always sent these smelly sloppy Mickey Mouse workers ...from now on I will only be going to Dutton plumbing they went above and beyond thank you again Edger for such a great service!!

David was polite prompt and very efficient.  He was working with a failing system and I was so thankful that he was able to stay and fix all the problems as they arose. He didn't just fix what he was called for and then leave, he stayed until it was done. I really appreciated that kind of service and would call on Dutton and David again.< /Review>

I was very nervous about calling a plumber due to the unknown cost and character of the company. I am new to the area so I didn't know who to trust. After looking at multiple reviews, I called Dutton; there wasn't a single review I saw that was less than 4.5 stars. Scheduling an appointment was simple, their staff is helpful and their customer service exceptional. I called them at 1AM on a Saturday and they got right back to me. While the repair was more than we had planned (not from a quote received by Dutton, just estimating based on internet searches), the service provided and Leo our technician, along with the warranty can't be beat. I plan to have them come out and do a comprehensive inspection of my home.  I believe they are trustworthy and that's very important to me.</Text>

<Review>This  company is great on cleaning out your lines, but I would not recommend them for anything else...higher than a cat's back on prices and strong armed us into getting us to buy this tankless water heater.  Too many things went wrong and still waiting for our chimney to get fixed....yes part of it was knocked down.   Mother, in the radio ad, wouldn't  be pleased.<//Review>< Pictures>

I called Dutton plumbing today for a shower drain issue and the whole process to schedule and have a technician come to my house was easy and pleasant. When Adam my service pro arrived he was super nice, explained to me that I didn’t really have a drain clog issue at all, and the water was normal to be in the catch. He was super nice and professional didn’t make me feel foolish at all for not knowing that. I had a drain cleaning done anyway since I don’t think it had ever been done on the house. Adam was wonderful to work with and knowledgeable and friendly. I would definitely use Dutton plumbing again and highly recommend Adam.</review>

James N. was wonderful. We had a leak that sprung on a pipe and we couldn't shut off the main. James came and took care of the leak ASAP. He also came back to repair the concrete that had to be broken to get to the pipe.  It was our first time using Dutton Plumbing and it was a pleasant one. He was very personable and professional. We definitely recommend Dutton Plumbing and James N.  Thank you. James N.< /review>

<Review>Luis was awesome. The valve on the main water line to the house was busted and needed to be repaired. The entire fixture was really old and did not have a pressure regulator between the street and the house, so I was not surprised when Luis recommended that the entire fixture be rebuilt. He quoted us a number of options from the 'band-aid' fix to the long term fix. Once we decided which one to go with Luis completed the job quickly and we are very happy with the results. There may be other lower priced plumbers out there however given the great customer service and quick response I would definitely recommend Dutton.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80e82ebed5b30749:0x6a99858c7f6e0140<//Gmap_id><Resp>{'time': 1522876583590, 'text': 'Dear Ryan,\nWe appreciate your kind and honest feedback, and we agree with you, Luis is awesome!

<text>I chose Dutton Plumbing for the second time.  The first was for two plugged shower drains -- excellent service then. Was introduced to a once per month powder to keep drains clear.  It's been a year and no problems with showers.

Saturday, December 12, 2015, my second experience with a plumbing issue.  Again, I was met with a courteous individual named Bryan Castaneda. He fixed the problem with a bathroom sink slow drain with complete skill; showed me the cause and how to avoid a future problem.

I'm completely satisfied with the performance and skill of the technicians and have recommended Dutton to family and friends if they have a plumbing problem. I also would like to note that they wear booties when entering the home and the cleanliness with which they perform the repair/service.

Thank you Dutton Plumbing.  You have a customer for life!< /text>< Pictures>

Dutton Plumbing helped us in less than 24 hours with a plugged shower.  Brandon D. was very nice, easygoing, and handled it quickly.  He also gave us a product to use going forward so it will stay nice and clear.  Thank you very much.</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Dutton Plumbing is the best! I'm so sick of tired of plumbers and other experts like electricians making appointments with me and either being late or just not showing up at all. Dutton kept me in the loop at all times, and once my appointment time came, Richard and Michael arrived to unplug my garbage disposal and kitchen pipes. The worked to get it unplugged, and did it professionally and competently. They strive to have 5-star reviews, and based on my experience tonight, they are certainly getting one. Thanks so much!</review>< Pics>

Juan of Dutton Plumbing did an outstanding plumbing job at my house.  He replaced two bathroom sink faucets with new ones, and he completely re-did an outside copper water line  that supplies a new irrigation sprinkler system and includes a new hose spigot as well. All the work was completed totally professionally and in a few hours it was all finished and leak-free of course. I appreciate the top-quality workmanship provided by Juan from Dutton Plumbing!< /Text>

<Review>If your in the need of having your plumbing repaired DO NOT use Dutton Plumbing. After waiting 27 hours, yes 27 hours, for a technician to come repair our hot water heater they phoned to let us know they could not make it out that day. Horrific way to run a business.

Used Dutton several times now, always a positive experience.  Telephone people are courteous to the max.  Technicians are always on time, friendly, clean, and ready to work.  They always explain step by step what they need to do, why, and what options I have.  Most recent experience was with Sean, but other techs have been equally excellent.  I don't plan on returning to my previous plumbing company.<//review>

workers one by one about themselves. The "5" star rating I wish I could have giving a "10" star rating but it only goes "5" star rating,  the company had sent me Mr Ernie Rodriguez , this gentleman did a "PROFESSIONAL" job
going all through our home checking all the pips while explaning to me what he is looking for Mr Ernie Rodriguez took his time and did not do a rush  job in which I really like.  I'm sooooooo very happy Mr Ernie Rodriguez came to our home he did a GREAT job repaiing our toilet and flushing out our tankless water heater .< /text><gmap_id>0x80e82ebed5b30749:0x6a99858c7f6e0140<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>These guys were awesome! They showed up quickly, assessed what needed to be done and took care of it. They even moved my new washing machine in place and hooked it up.  They also made sure my cat didn't run out the garage door. They were very friendly and professional and I would certainly call Dutton Plumbing again and ask for Matt D.< /Review>< pics>

The news was terrible but the end results were great.  After Jay N. and Nicholas G. spent more then five hours trying to snake open the blocked drain, via the camera, a broken and impacted old metal sewer pipe was detected, of all places under the garage floor. In less than three days Jay N. and Juan P. and crew replaced roughly 30 feet of underground pipe,  mostly under the concrete, added two "clean outs" replace the "T", this was all done by only opening up a three by three foot square area in our garage floor.   Jay N. and Juan P. were super; courteous, polite and kept us informed through out the process, when completed the work area was cleaned, we didn't have to touch it.  I would highly recommend these guys especially with complex issues as ours due to their knowledge, work ethics and technology.<//Review>

<text>The plumbing technicians Juan R and James C did an excellent job of evaluating my service needs. They ultimately repaired a toilet and removed and installed a new garbage disposal. They were very clean, and not pushy. I was offered many choices for consideration. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is Dutton is very expensive in my opinion. However, they arrived promptly in the morning and got the job done!< /text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

This review is for Diego Magaña from Dutton Plumbing. Diego came to fix a variety of issues at my house. He was very knowledgeable, professional, and a pleasure to work with. I had been looking for a specific replacement shower head for several years and had asked two previous plumbers who were unable to find what I wanted. Diego knew exactly what I needed and easily found the perfect one! I highly recommend him.< /Text>

<name>bradly johnson</name>< Review>
I called Dutton because I had more then just a water plumbing issue with a newly purchased home. I had and issue with the gas line routing for the stove and a huge bird's nest of pipe and tubes for a reverse osmosis system under the kitchen sink that was leaking everywhere. Danny D was the tech that came to my house. He was very nice and was upfront with what he was doing. He fixed the leaks, re-routed the gas line, and we knocked out the documentation, then he left. Shortly after we noticed that sink only had hot water now and the stove needed an additional 90 degree elbow to get it to sit flush with the wall.

We called Dutton and they sent Danny back. Even though it was a Saturday night he stayed to figured out how everything needed to be and got it all working perfect. The previous owners had it so messed up he ended up having to almost re-plumb the entire sink. Great Job and thanks again for staying late to fix everything. that is one less stressful thing I dont need to worry about anymore.</Review>

Brian and Decarlo did a great job. The job took longer than they expected and made changes I suggested. They were neat, competent and took the time to answer my questions and tell me about other plumbing concern they noticed on a walk through. Brian's main concern was that I was satisfied with his work. I highly recommend them.< /Text>

The tech was polite and answered my questions. His quote for $1500 to fix a problem that took me 1hour and cost me $10 was a little much. His work may have been more extensive than what it took to fix the problem but all I wanted was to fix the problem.</Text>

Great Communication. Friendly Service. Had a pool drain rooted. Adam explained the issues, the risks, potential problems, possible extra costs, and let me decide what to do.

Turns out, thankfully, it was straightforward and everything got cleared out.

The home office also did a great job keeping up to date as to delays in getting to me.</Text>

We had no water from all the faucet. The water heater tank is also clogged and they had to replace it.The  water tube under the sink and toilet are also clogged and They fixed it. They also cleaned up after their work was done. Very polite people. But a little pricey.</Text>< Pics>

As usual, my experience with Dutton Plumbing (Brian, specifically) was excellent. Brian has done quite a few repairs/installations at my house and he is always professional, efficient, clean and funny. I really like talking to him, and appreciate how he shows me specific aspects of the work without being condescending.  water heater, I am satisfied that it is finally done correctly.
I am always so happy when Brian leaves, not because I want him to leave, but because I am confident in the work that he completed to take care of my house!< /review>

I had a shower drain that was plugged up and called Dutton for the first time.
The tech they sent out was Brad F. He did an awesome job taking care of the drain issue and performed a safety check on other plumbing related items in the home.
Brad was on time, called before arriving and even wore shoe covers to protect my floors.
Very happy with his performance and will definitely  request Brad if I have another plumbing problem again.<//text>

I wouldn't recommend these guys to clean my toilet!
Unfortunately my handyman was not available so I called these guys to clear a drain.
They told me it was against there policy to use a rooter from the roof. They didn't attempt to use a rooter from anywhere else. They used a hydro jet for one hour but didn't clear the plug. Charged me $639.69 for the work.
Solution I found my handy man and he used a rooter from the roof. He cleared the clog in 5 minutes.  Also Dutton recommended having a new drain pipe from the outside replaced for a charge of $6,583. Since the drain has been a recurring problem I did want that done but not by Dutton. No I accepted a bid of $2,000 from another plumber to have the pipe replaced. The work is done and everything is like new everything works perfect. I feel stupid for ever calling Dutton<//review>

Mark is amazing. He explained everything so clearly that even someone with zero constructional knowledge , like myself, was able to comprehend the problem and what needed to be done. He has a strong work ethic. He worked quickly to relieve the problem without compromising the quality of his work.  It was refreshing to see the pride that he took in his work. Not only will I recommend him to my friends and family but he will be the first person to request for ALL future plumbing needs. I could not have asked for a friendlier, competent plumber.< /Review>

We had a plumbing emergency and although we had never used Dutton Plumbing before they were recommended.  We were so please with Chad S.  He was thorough and explained everything that he needed to do to fix our leak.  Additionally he was very helpful in recommending a remediation company that helped with the water damage.  I would recommend Dutton Plumbing and Chad S to anyone with plumbing needs.</Text>

Everyone on the crew (2 different crews, 3 different days) were friendly and worked diligently. They're probably a little higher priced than most but I was very comfortable and confident knowing that they would do the job right, which they did. Special shout out to Mark M who really stood out as a five star employee. He's not just super personable, he actually knows his stuff too. He even offered to stop working and help my mother who became very ill in the middle of the job! What plumber does that? Will definitely be using Dutton, and hopefully Mark, for future plumbing disasters. 2 thumbs up!<//Text>< Rate>

<Text>Jaylyn arrived and was very pleasant from the start and let me know every step of the way what he was doing. He did a quick diagnostic and let me know exactly how much it would be.  Before he started working. After he was done he gave me some helpful hints on how to keep it from reoccurring and let me know the job is guaranteed for 90 days. He was very friendly and professional and I would definitely recommend him to anyone that had  plumbing issues as well asDutton plumbing. My first experience using a plumber was definitely a great one and a  very easy process.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Tony & Lon replaced the on/off water valve for my washer.  They were so nice, professional, and knowledgeable.  They cleaned up my laundry room and moved my new washer into the laundry room for me.

<text>First of all, I would like to thank the technician John Williams who finished the job of replacing the water heater. He did an outstanding job and made sure all the codes are followed as per Federal and State.
Dutton went above and beyond my expectations. I never wrote a review for any services or business. This is my first online review ever. Thats bcoz Dutton has made a unforgettable mark on their service.

Infact the mistake was on my part on the pricing but Dutton took it in a very professional way to make it a smooth transaction. I never seen any business doing that. Right from the Technician John Williams, Helpdesk and to the manager Eric whom I spoke to was very respectful and patience in hearing my concern on the payment.

This is way beyond any service I have ever experienced. I would like to definitely give a 20 star rating If there was one. I have no words to explain beyond this.

Again I appreciate the service and professionalism by Dutton and their people. Thanks again.<//text>< name>

I called many companies before calling Dutton Plumbing. Why I didn't call them first is beyond me. That was my first mistake.  From my past experiences, they're the only company who always comes through for us. When I called in a panic for my client,  the associate on the phone, I believe his name was Dane,  was more than happy to help. He got right on it and followed up with me to let me know my help would be on his way at a certain time.  When the plumber arrived he arrived earlier than expected. Luis Z explained to me and my client,  the owner, what he found wrong and what the estimated cost would be to repair it.  Not only was Luis thorough but he price he quoted was even less because the problem was not as bad as expected. When Luis first arrived he put his booties on at the front door and as he proceeded, he was friendly, professional and very informative. My client,  her family and I give Luis an A+.  Thank you Luis</Text>

Great service - prompt and nice guys.  They were very clear on what the problem was,  what was causing it, and my options to fix it.  Scheduled fix was within a few days and was done in 2 hours.  The technician realized my situation was complex and brought his supervisor to evaluate as well.  This turned out to be great because he found an alternative solution that saved me thousands of dollars.  Thank you so much!  I will be calling Dutton again for any future plumbing concerns.< /text>

If you want a service that doesn't do the job correctly, falsifies information/lies to their customers, provides terrible and rude customer service after they've been paid, breaks customers property without telling them, and refuses to return to fix a problem or get the job done correctly then this is the plumber for you! It took me over a week to get someone to my house for a job, which I get it, they're busy and I understood. Finally when the guy gets here, he goes to the wrong house. Eventually I tracked him down and he went and "completed" his job. Completed as in, it worked for several minutes afterwards and went right back to not working again. He also broke several things in my bathroom and left glass all over the floor. He ripped the toilet up from the floor so now when anybody sits on it, it moves all over the place. He also left the toilet cover on my counter/in my sink. Since I gave him the benefit of the doubt, I believed him when he told me he fixed the problem and never mentioned about breaking anything. When my two year old and I walked into the bathroom we got glass in our feet. I called Dutton immediately and told them what happened and that they needed to send their employee back to fix what he broke. They could have cared less about the glass in my sons feet let alone mine. The rep was extremely rude and said he would call me back, never did. I called again and re-explained the situation and that rep was just as rude as the one before. Plumber never showed back up to fix what he broke, and no matter how many times I've called I've never gotten a call back. I get it, accidents happen, but to break something and leave glass all over a bathroom floor especially when you're aware of small children living in that household has me without words. I went another week and a half without a functioning toilet until I had enough money after the money Dutton Plumbing stole from me. Still not fixed, and still no refund, broken property still not replaced. Thanks Dutton Plumbing!!!<//Text>

My experience with Dutton Plumbing and their service specialist was outstanding.  They were fast and very cautious. Checked out everything and made sure that I had options on how to solve my problems.  The work was done professionally and quickly.  The service Specialist Kevin was informative, professional and always had a smile.  The area worked on was cleaned up and left in very nice condition.  Sometimes it is also the small things that count like making sure they covered their shoes before entering the house.  I would use and recommend them anytime.< /Text>

Dutton employees who've worked on my plumbing issues, from telephone arrangements and a follow-up call, to the excellent service techs Danny & Brian were been very friendly and professional.
Last year I purchased the silver level contract, giving me a full, detailed inspection prior to my recent work. My 40 year-old house had several things that weren't up to today's codes, as well as the usual hard water damage to the plumbing. There were no pressure sales, just recommendations and a convenient list so I was able to prioritize and plan if and when to have various things done.
I heartily recommend this company!< /Review>

We appreciated Diego and the services he provided.  He knows how to listen well, was very professional, courteous, and supportive.  After listening to our issues, he assessed the situation and found the root of our leakage, presented the solutions and carried out the job within the time frame promised.  His team mate, Lon, was also very courteous.

We certainly do not want another water leakage problem but if we ever encounter one again, we know who to look for!

Diego, keep up the good work, you're awesome!  Lon, we know you're on your way!< /Review>

Excellent plumbing company.  Easy to work with and prompt.  I had an unusual outdoor pipe leak and Matt D found it and fixed it which was amazing!  At first we thought we'd have to dig up the front walkway, but he found a way to work around that option.  I was so impressed, I signed a contract for their Preferred Customer package<//Text>

For years, we'd been struggling with a plastic outflow pipe attached to our garbage disposal unit. After finally realizing no amount of duct tape or stacks of old VHS tapes was going to keep that pipe in place, I reached out to Dutton during a courtesy follow up call.

It's worth mentioning they did a great and major job with our upstairs toilet a couple years back, and they put in a new water heater before that.

Yesterday, Technician Ryan came by and took care of our pipe problem quickly and affordably. He was awesome! 10/10 experience, and I can only attempt to describe the joy I felt at basking in such a shiny metal pipe gleaming over a clean under-sink cubby. Thanks again, Dutton! You've got a customer for life.< /text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><review>I highly recommend this company if you need an honest accurate estimate for any plumbing problem. Everyone at Dutton Plumbing was very professional and curious.  I called for an estimate regarding a possible slab leak. The technicians arrived on time as scheduled.  I was greeted at my door by Matt; who immediately placed a clean mat on my door step, put on clean cover shoes over his work shoes. Matt accessed my situation very quickly entered my options with the exact cost on his iPad (which was very reasonable compared to other quotes I received). I opted for the slab fix..the by-pass option would also have fixed the hot water pipe leak in the slab. Within a 30 minutes Matt had located the exact location of the leak, and identified the hot water pipe. He prepared the work area, carefully removed 4 titles (without breaking them) and started the work to open up the cement to access the pipe.  Matt found the copper pipe with the leak. He then very carefully silver soldered the new pipe in place, wrapped the pipe with a thick rubber jacket, back-filled the hole in the slab, poured in quick drying cement to seal the floor. Matt’s work was meticulous, neat and professional. I am one happy customer ..and would recommend you call Dutton Plumbing if you ever need a professional plumbing job. Thanks again Matt for your expertise it is much appreciated.  Tony</review></record>

<Text>My hot water heater sprung a leak at 1:30 in the morning and caused a pretty big mess. Water leaked out all night no matter how many towels I put in place. At 6:30 am. I called Dutton and explained my situation. Ryan and his partner Lon arrived at my house at 9:15 am.  They were both very polite and took the time to explain to me what needed to be done. The job was completed and cleanup was finished by 11:00.  I thought it would be an all day ordeal but Ryan and Lon were finished, the whole area cleaned and swept and I had the rest of the day to do as I pleased.  I am so thankful for their skill and professionalism, their understanding and helpfulness.  A great experience!</Text>< Pics>

<username>Adrian Rogers< /username><time>1559259363892</time><Rating>2< /Rating><Text>I was impressed at first with the way Dutton emails/txts you info on the plumber that will be coming out to you home. Then once the plumber came and was doing his tech stuff/slab leak locate-er stuff he started making comments that I really didn't need to hear. Nothing obscene, but I got the feeling that he wasn't confident in the work he was performing. I need confidence, I'm a family of 5, I don't need any uncertainty in the work that's going to be done, fixed and stay fixed.

Amateurs think, Professionals know.

I had a third opinion come out the following day and their findings were different. He didn't find the actual pipe that was leaking and said the leaking area was in a different area than the new plumbers, they are actually repairing/jack hammering it as I type. The job isn't even complete yet, so essentially I don't have a finished product/functioning water system, but I feel more confident in the guys working on it right now.< /Text>< pics>

<text>First time calling Dutton Plumbing and Rooter. Technician Dan Denney along with a helper responded within 20 minutes. Magnificent. Dan was very professional and friendly showing a meaningful interest in our problem. His explanation was precise and understandable. Employees of Denney’s caliber should never go unnoticed and with this review we want to bring Denney to the attention of management and future customers. Dan Denney and his helper we very clean (seeing their shirts were extremely white) and wore floor shoe covering when entering our home.  We will definitely call Dutton Plumbing if plumbing problems occur. We give Dan Denney and his helper a hardy “atta-boy on a job well done.”<//text><user_id>102322228531983191224< /user_id><gmapID>0x80e82ebed5b30749:0x6a99858c7f6e0140<//gmapID></record>

<review>I had a terrible plumbing problem ( collapsed sewer line) on Christmas eve. Dutton Plumbing to the rescue and Kudos and many thanks to Sean and the Dutton Team for giving me a temporary solution to get me through Christmas and then a follow up to permanently fix the problem. The Dutton Team worked quickly, carefully and were very clear in what was the problem and how it would be resolved.

They truly are the best plumber in the community.< /review><Resp>{'time': 1468435109643, 'text': 'Thanks, Pete! It was our pleasure serving you. Keep us in mind the next time you need a Simi Valley plumber.'}<//Resp>< Pics>

Horrible customer service and no dependability.  Saw that they rated highly online and decided to give them a call to come evaluate and repair 2 broken faucets and a garbage disposal.  They scheduled the appointment for the following Monday from 1-3 pm.  As monday rolled around, they called only a couple of hours in advance to let us know they were too busy to make the scheduled appointment and rescheduled us for one full week later.  We agreed.  After waiting one full week, they called again, only an hour in advance to let us know that they were again, too busy to make the appointment and tried to reschedule for the FOLLOWING MONDAY!  To this we said absolutely not!  We cleared 2 Monday afternoons based on their schedule and lived 2 full weeks with non functioning appliances, only to be told they could still not service our needs due to their inability to schedule, plan and execute.  DO NOT RECOMMEND unless you want to be jerked around and left hanging.  Tough to imagine all of these positive reviews are real after our experience.  Extremely unprofessional!<//text>

I decided to call Dutton Plumbing when my tankless waterheater stopped working. This was my 1st time using their services. They were so quick to respond and send out a Tech within 2 and a half 3 hours of my initial call, the Tech was very knowledgeable and was able to fix and get my Tankless waterheater up and running again! Very Happy customer.<//Text>

<text>Mark came out to fix a stopped up toilet. It doesn't get much more professional than this. First, the company calls you to say when they are on their way. Then you get an email with the technician's picture and bio. Mark was very neat, professional and personable. He used rubber booties and assessed the problem right away. He laid down a mat so he didn't make a mess. The problem was solved quickly and resolved. I couldn't have asked for a better experience.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1468273937229, 'text': 'Thank you, Paul! We’re happy you were pleased with our plumbing service.

<Text>We were experiencing some slow drains.  We called Dutton and they were here in about an hour and a half.  Jay was very polite, made notes as I explained what I could about the problem.   He inspected under the building  (prefab) and recommended clearing the drain from the house to the street.  During the process,  he hit a couple of blockages that cleared out.  He also recommend a bio cleaner for the PVC plumbing.  Overall, fast arrival, thorough work, and pleasant service.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80e82ebed5b30749:0x6a99858c7f6e0140<//gmap_id><rating>5</rating></record>

I wasnt home when Adam came to my house, but both my daughter and husband went on about how professional, knowledgeable,  and pleasant Adam was.

Since I don't know a thing about plumber prices, I was kinda stunned at the price for the services I needed. Seems about average though.

Will definitely use Dutton Plumbing again if the need arises.

UPDATE: We ended up needing DUTTON PLUMBING again and Andy really was just as great as my family said. Will never use another plumber again!!< /Review>

Jesse L was great to deal with.  He arrived ahead of time, but I was called with updates on his schedule so I was ready.  He gave us an easy to understand estimate for the work and completed the work very efficiently.  He even did extras like checking our water pressure and the condition of our water heater.  He left the workspace clean, neat and dry.  He didn't just fix and leave, he ran water and reinspected his work twice with time between just to make sure everything was okay before he left.  He actually left the whole assembly looking better than the original builder of the house.
I would give Dutton and Jesse L more than five stars if I could!<//Review>

<review>Dutton Plumbing was wonderful, no waiting and wondering if and when they would arrive.  We received phone updates as to when they would arrive.  They were quick, clean, and courteous.  Ryan, Dave and Tyler are in our opinion the best plumbers in Simi Valley.  I would highly recommend them to anyone.<//review><user>118015144677297186498</user>< Pics>

This morning I had a dishwasher delivery from home depot,  they were going to install it as well.  I was told that they couldn't because the valve was frozen and I should call a plumber.  I called Dutton around 8am and they were at my house before 9..they were polite and professional....The did a great job and were able to install things necessary that the other old plumber had " forgotten" include... The entire job was done completely and quickly.  I spent more then I had hoped to but I fell the job was done right and have one less thing to worry about   Thank you Ryan and Mario    Susan< /review>

They were so personable and answered the kiddos questions. They were here after hours with such patience for our issues. I'd have had them over for dinner if I'd known our problem would take so long and still need attention. I hope they are the techs we get a second visit from when it's time.

O contracted Dutton Plumbing yesterday at 10 am due to the pool water faucet line leaking. I explained that I had to be at my daughter's high school graduation at 5:30 pm. Diego arrived at approximately 1:30 pm. He completed the repairs at 4:30 pm allowing my family to be on time for the ceremony.  I appreciated his professionalism and attention to detail.  I have used Dutton Plumimg services 3 times now, and I highly recommend  this company.</text>

<review>I had a drainage leak beneath my kitchen sink.  I tried fixing it for three days myself but it would not stop leaking. Admitting defeat I called Dutton Plumbing.  They sent on over Steve S. who looked over the situation and gave me an estimate.  Normally I would have gotten three bids but after three days of fighting leaks that trashed my bottom cabinet shelf, I relented figuring if it was good enough for Mom, then go with it.  Steve explained the piping was the PVC pipe, gaskets and slip rings were old and best replaced entirely. After four hours of work, except for the Garbage Disposal, everything was replaced. The leaks stopped. Cost was not cheap but the fix seemed to be working and with a year warranty on their work, I was satisfied. Unfortunately the next day a weep formed under my right sink .  I called Dutton Plumbing and set up another appointment.  They wanted to send Steve out again to repair it but he was diverted for an emergency repair.  However they honored their warranty and sent out Juan P.  who determined another gasket was needed and fixed the issue at no further cost.  It is now three days later and no further leaks as of the writing of this review.  My wife and I say MOM Approves.< /review>< Pics>

<pics>None< /pics><Review>After a frantic call to Dutton Plumbing regarding 'no water' to our home, we were fortunate to have Randy Arnold from Sutton Plumbing come to our home in less than an hour to review and evalute the problem.
Randy not only knows his business extensively,  you immediately feel his compassion, awareness and thoughtfulness towards the homeowner and the 'crisis' they are experiencing.  After much thought and conversation between Randy and my hiusbanc, Randy fixed the problem.  He was extremely helpful and considerate in moving many long hoses from place to place to be sure that our horses had water while the work was being done and then putting the hoses all back in place.

He initially cleared the line but with the camera saw cement rocks that had come dislodged and would just clog up the line again in the future. He and his assistant Guillermo worked for 3 hours to remove the loose rocks from the sewer line "by hand fishing" with a coat hanger, the camera, and the 3000 PSI hydro jet. They did a great job, but what I admired the most was their persistence in making certain the line was clear and nothing left behind. These guys were friendly, knowledgeable,
professional and persistent with a can do spirit. They are a credit to Dutton Plumbing and I will not hesitate in calling them again.< /review></record>

After having called numerous local plumbers who didn't bother to show up or even call back, I called Dutton Plumbing to fix an outdoor PVC pipe leak, and I couldn't be happier. Dan & Jake were 100% professionals and fixed the problem in 40 minutes. Even the dispatcher on their customer service line was helpful.

Ritz Plumbing tried and failed to fix the pipes 5 times in a row and - in fact, made the problem worse after each visit. After Ritz Plumbing gave up (and tried to extort additional money for warranty work), Dutton Plumbing was there to pick up the pieces AND show me exactly what negligence and shoddy workmanship caused my the leak in the first place.

Dan & Jake were knowledgeable, experienced, and more than helpful with their explanations and suggestions. They showed up ON TIME and within hours of being called. They even stayed on for an extra hour or so after the job was completed so they could test that the leak was indeed corrected. Dutton Plumbing warrants the work for 1 year after the visit and as Dan put it: "We will own our mistakes and not charge you extra."  Too bad more companies aren't like this.</Review>

Dutton pulled a bait-and-switch by trying to get me to agree to a $25,000 overhaul of our plumbing system for a basic repiping job, which should have cost 1/3 of that amount. The job would have entailed ripping up our front yard, and replacing a perfectly good, recently installed water heater. Then they proceeded to disparage another company we were considering. I will never work with this company.< /review>

<Text>Jay N. Was my plumber mainly and he was great. Very knowledgeable, friendly, and accommodating of my schedule. I had quite a lot of plumbing work done ( replaced 2 toilets, 2 sinks/ vanities, new kitchen faucet, and replaced main sewer line out to the street.). During all this work, dispatch sent other plumbers, who were also great. I would recommend any of the plumbers. My only problem was with dispatch, who did not seem to comprehend the scope of the work being done on a house built in the 1950's. Dispatch often would schedule Jay to come at 5pm, and he wouldn't be able to make it, as he was on another job and couldn't make it. So, if there was another plumber available they would send them, but that late in the day, it was difficult for them to complete a job. So, I feel that had the dispatcher used better judgement and gave the plumbers extra time to complete a job ( allow for old plumbing - things do go wrong ), my large job could have been done in a more timely manner.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Review>We needed a repair done quickly because our washing machine could not be repaired until it was done. Sean (and one other person) from Dutton Plumbing came the same day we called, within two hours of calling. Both were professional and nice. They fixed our problem and helped check for leaks. Sean was great about answering my questions and wanting to help us figure out why our water bill was so high, too. I always enjoy finding companies who come quickly and are easy to talk to!  I can’t speak on pricing because we did not get any other quotes since this needed to be done quickly.</Review>< rate>

< review>
After a long day, I had to come home and deal with a completely blocked sewer.  Having utilized Dutton Plumbing several times before, I did not waste any time deciding which plumbing company to call.  A quick call, followed by a return call to confirm the time frame when the plumber would show up, and not much longer after that, the plumber showed up.  Friendly.  Professional.  Considerate.  He got right to the job and took care of the problem.  Thank you very much!< /review>

Awesome service ethics! Thanks Matt for helping us and fixing the recurring issue! I have First American Home Buyers Protection, and their contract plumbing company could not fix a simple issue. And they were blaming something which was not at all the main cause of problem. Thanks to Matt, he came and fix the issue the very first time itself!</review>

<Review>I am a young, single mother and Dutton's technicians basically tried to rob me. A 5 or 6 inch piece of exposed PVC pipe between two connectors on my sprinkler valve broke. I called Dutton and they sent their technician Matt out with another tech (not sure why they sent TWO people when I told them it was literally just a piece of PVC that needed to be removed and replaced). If I knew how to deal with the blue PVC cement I would have fixed the damn thing myself. So Matt and tech 2 show up and tell me "Oh, yeah that's an easy fix. We'll just have to dig around it a little bit and I'll charge you the exposed rate so it won't be as much for you." Tech 2 is in the grass kicking a soccer ball around with my daughter. They're really laying it on thick getting my guard down. So... now it comes time for them to rig up the invoice and get my signature... $450!!! Are you kidding me?! At first, because I have no idea what I'm doing, I was going to agree to it. Thankfully my roommate got home in the nick of time and told them that we would get a second opinion. My father came by and fixed it in less than 10 minutes. Dutton was going to rob a young, single mother of $450 for a $5 piece of PVC, some PVC cement, and 7 minutes of labor. How could anyone be so heartless and money hungry?</Review>< gmapID>

Steve's diagnosis was quick and the problem resolved within minutes. Steve's professionalism sets a high standard for others to follow. He was personable, courteous and knowledgeable; and he didn't mind when I peppered him with multiple questions - answering each one in layman's terms. Steve brings credit not only to himself, but to Dutton Plumbing. Like my wife always says: "When you find a great doctor, dentist, auto mechanic or plumber - you stay with them!"

I would get others to bid the work. My wife called these guys when I was traveling for work and asked them to hook up the washer dryer (we just moved) and fix a diverter. They charged her $500 and then tried to up sell her on $20,000 worth of work. We will call around next time and don't plan to use them again.< /Text>

< review>
All I can say is... GET A SECOND OPINION!! ... I had 1 bath room with  a clogged sink and toilet.. They said my pipes were broke under the house and the one pipe in front was cracked.. They said I needed ALL new plumbing at a cost of $12,000.00.. I questioned this because the rest of my plumbing was working fine.. I said I thought $12,000.00 was slightly extreme and their answer was "Well we do financing"  They never showed me any pictures or video that was used during the inspection.. I told them no thank you and without any other options from them, they left.. I called another company who came with their camera and showed me that the main entrance where he used his camera had not even been opened due to it being covered with dirt and spider webs. He then had me watch the video of the inside of my plumbing (amazing btw..) to show me no broken pipes but areas where there was settling that was causing pooling and due to build up, caused the clogs.. He flushed out the pipes with a hydro hose and viola... no clogs.. Oh and there was NO cracked pipes in the front either.. He was gracious enough to show me everything that he was doing so that I could understand..He charged me $625.00... I don't know if that is a good or bad price for what he did but, I do know it is a far cry from $12,000.00..  Shame on you Dutton Pluming !! If I could give you 0 stars I would!!< /review>

My first contact with Dutton was through Tania, who was super friendly, efficient and knowledgeable.  I felt at ease working with her, especially after a negative experience with a previous service provider.  The appointment set up was very easy and when I was unable to keep the initial appointment, the dispatchers called back right away and followed up the next morning with a "first call of the day" appointment.  My technician was Kyle.  He was on time, friendly, reassuring and expert in his work.  He showed me everything that he was doing and explained the problem (which was due to some apparent ineptitude by the previous service provider.  Kyle didn't try to upsale me on any services.  He pointed out options that would save me money in the near and long term.  I was very satisfied.  My only regret is that I didn't call Dutton the first time around.<//review>

Juan was very professional and explained the entire process with us.  He introduced the other workers and what they would be working on each day.  He called to let us know who would be at our home if he was not here himself.  Juan and his crew were very careful to cover their work  area to limit the dust and wore botties on their shoes when entering our home.  This was a very painful experience for my favorite family but Juan made it as easy as possible for us and because if this we are very grateful to him.  He is a very hard and knowledge worker.  Thank you</Review>

Called 4 times, spoke with Katie 2 times, she was nice but the technician never called me back. In their defense I called 5 plumbing companies to look at my non-functional water heater. NO ONE WOULD CALL OR COME OUT TO MY HOUSE!!!!!!  Money was not a problem, my landlord is paying for it. Is it possible that all plumbing companies have so much money and are so busy that they can't even call back??? Cold showers won't cut it in the morning. I will fix it myself tomorrow or find someone who cares enough to at least call back!  Shame on all af you! My kids are going to suffer through freezing showers in the morning I hope you you are happy. VERY WEAK!!!!<//Review>

Got a call from Kayla at Dutton saying that a technician would be out to check on our plumbing.  Dutton was here in January and replaced our waste system under the house and our experience with them was excellent.  Today was a courtesy service at no charge.  Emanuel T was the technician and just prior to his arrival which coincided with the appointment time I received a notification call from Chris.  Emanuel T checked appropriate plumbing and water heater for any problems.  He was prompt, quick, neatly dressed with clean shoe covers and very courteous and left a complete report of his visit and said if we experienced any problems to call Dutton. I appreciate the service.<//review>

Home inspection today from Danny D.  I was very pleased how he checked all problem areas, found the cause and made the necessary corrections quickly and efficiently.  He was clean and courteous and continued his inspection by checking our tankless waterheater and installing cards designating emergency shut off valves for gas and water on the appliance.  He also inspected the water line coming into the house and checked water pressure.  He was also extremely informative and was most helpful.  I definitely give him my highest rating.< /Text>

My tech was Kevin K.  He was fast, friendly, and cleaned up very well after himself.  I had a broken toilet seal.  He investigated the area, asking for what I had noticed, before coming to the same conclusion as I had.  We ended up having to replace our toilet, as it broken after he removed the base screws.  He work quick, he cleaned up very nicely, and explained everything he found, he did, and to look out for in the future before he left.  Great job Kevin!  Thank you!< /Review>

<review>Nick G is a super professional guy with tremendous amount of patience, courtesy and knowledge. I wish most of service guys and gals are like him. He takes tremendous amount of care and listens to the customer. He is persistent and won't quit till he fixes the problem. Two other plumbers gave up before him but he kept snaking till the back up was all cleared. Super fantastic guy. Don't make him a manager coz you need more people like Nick in the field who are great testimonial for Dutton! Thanks Nick!<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>Terrible!!  They claim "Outstanding Customer Service" and " a plumber you would send to your mother house"  Canceled my appointment with them 3 times!!  Always calling at the last minute and making some sort of excuse.  Talked to a guy named Vince- who as sharp as a marble, and seemed totally lost in trying to come up with an excuse.  Ask for the owner of the company to call me.  Took time off all three times to be here for them.
TOO MANY GOOD PLUMBING COMPANIES OUT THERE- RUN FROM THIS ONE!!<//Text><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

Danny D and Leo B provided service for our residence on a leaking faucet and water pressure regulator. Danny was the main technician and Leo assisted him. Danny was very knowledgable, professional, courteous and friendly. He took time to explain the problem to us, how he planned to approach remedying it and the relative costs. As for expertise and professionalism, their service was excellent. I was especially pleased by Dan's positive professional demeanor. They were prompt, finished the work within the quoted timeframe, explained their process beforehand so we knew exactly what services we were receiving, and they left their workspace as clean as they found it. As for cost, we have worked with less expensive plumbers in the past, so Dutton is not the most competitive provider in terms of pricing, however with Dan's professionalism and a very organized business service model (we have not experienced a more organized effort, from front office to completion), customers can reasonably expect to pay a bit more than what a sole provider/owner-operator would charge that doesn't offer such a comprehensive service model, which includes your initial call, prompt scheduling, phone updates, e-mail updates and accurate time estimations for both technician arrival and work performance. We might have been able to shop around for a cheaper solution since this call was not an emergency call, but overall, we feel we have received value for our dollar.<//review>

<text>This past week I was in need of a plumber.........Mon., 12/23 I called and Tues., 12/24 Matt D from Dutton Plumbing came to my house.
When I initially called, I told Vince that I needed muscle and not brains for a pretty simple job with one small glitch.
Here comes Matt with the muscle AND the brains to solve the glitch that two other people could not! And with the brains came a big heart. Matt is the complete package.
Dutton Plumbing is very, very, very lucky to have Matt D. And I am lucky to have Dutton Plumbing to call when I need help.
Thank you Dutton and thank you Matt.

OK, so here's the deal. Supposedly................the 2nd time is never as good as the 1st, Well not with Dutton Plumbing. Matt D far surpassed his 1st visit. Here's the fun part, he was with another plumber named Matt.....so I just called them Matts. They did a beautiful job. Thank you Dutton and thank you Matt D.

Earlier in the year we had some MAJOR plumbing issues with our main sewer line and stumbled upon Dutton. Not only were they quick to come out but they truly sincerely care about their customers and will work with you. Since then they've helped replace parts on or water heater and most recent unclogged a shower drain. Everyone from their dispatch to technicians are knowledgeable and polite. Best of all their prices are reasonable. I never feel like I'm being taken advantage of. They will continue to be our "go to" for ask my plumbing needs. Thank you Dutton!!< /Review>

Two days before Christmas and everything in my house is backing up into my tub. I tried to fix it myself, and got nowhere. I called up Dutton at 3:30pm and they said they could get someone out there that afternoon. I got a text with a quick bio and picture of the Plumber that would be out, his name was Felix and was great. At 5pm he arrived. He crawled under my house to check the plumbing, made a quick assessment and advised me what I may need to do in the near future since my plumbing was so old.

I sat down with my wife and let him work and after a short while I heard that beautiful sound of water draining. Wrapped up quick afterwards, gave me a few tips and took my payment, which was great at only 73 dollars (with their special for clearing drains).

I was very happy with Felix and the entire experience with Dutton, and would highly recommend them.<//Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>I have been a faithful customer of Dutton for over 15 years.  Thursday night around 9pm I entered my garage only to find my hot water heater leaking water.  I immediately contacted Dutton's 24 hour emergency service number plastered on the front of the hot water heater they installed, only to find out that they no longer provide 24 hour emergency services and that some one would contact me the next day. I could not wait and had to search for another plumber in the yellow pages.  Another came to my rescue and turned off the water heater, disconnected the gas line after turning it off and drained the tank of the remaining water.  I could not for the life of me understand a plumbing service not offering 24 hour emergency services.  Dutton came next day to offer to install a new hot water heater for an astronomical cost.  I searched the Web and believe I found an excellent new plumber and they are installing my new hot water heater as we speak and at half the cost of Dutton's quote.  And they offer 24 hour emergency services!  I have a new Plumber!
GOOD-BYE DUTTON!<//text>< Pics>

<review>Returned home from a vacation to find a broken pipe in my front yard and had to shut off the water from the street.   Call Dutton Plumbing and was told that someone would be out between 8 and 10am.   Ryan J showed up at 8:45.   20 feet of galvanized piping need to be replaced with copper and Ryan recommend installing a ball shut off value.   Ryan gave me price up front with no hidden cost.   Ryan was able to restore water to the house while he replaced the broken pipe.    He finished the job with in 2 1/2 hours and my yard looked like he was never there (minus the pool of water).   Ryan was very polite, clean, explained everything he was going to do and answered all of my questions.   Thanks Ryan.    Dutton prices are higher then other plumbers but the quality of work and service you get I feel it is worth it.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>My parent's just purchased a mobile home and the hot water heater was broken. They called Dutton Plumbing to come out and Diego was the technician at that time. My dad being a contractor was sure we would have to replace it. Diego could have easily taken their money and replaced the water heater with no complaints from them but instead, he took his time, looked everything over and found a fantastic solution to not have to replace the whole water heater. In the end, Diego saved my parents over a thousand dollars and was extremely friendly.

After that Diego and Kevin came out because the water system that is currently in the house is horrible. They were friendly and professional while bending over backwards to get my dad the price he wanted and my mom the system she wanted. The manager Shawn was also awesome in working with Kevin. I highly recommend them!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< gmap_id>

<Review>Dutton was spot on with coordinating and communicaiting their field staff's arrival time, eliminating wasted waiting time.

< Review>
The technician was great and he did an excellent job.  He was  curtious and friendly.  He explained what he was doing.  Should get a raise. The only complaint that I have is that the cost of the job was outrageous for 2 hrs of work putting in a faucet.  Which was an automatic charge.  Approx. $460.  Dont  think I would use them again 2nd time the price was way over charged. Not doctor's or lawyer who always over charge.  Tech was great thou.

I called Dutton Plumbing because they all showed up at Starbucks in Porter Ranch on a number of occasions and bought everyone coffee.  They quickly schedule a plumber to come fix my broken shut off valve for the backyard irrigation so there would be no further flooding.  I received an email shortly thereafter with a picture of Jake M who would be coming to fix my broken valve.  When he arrived, he discovered that the shut off valve from the city was frozen shut, so he had to call DWP to come and close the valve.  They said it might be 2 - 3 hours or longer, and he told me just to call him whenever DWP showed up and he would come back and fix my broken valve.  He then called DWP to have them come turn the water back on, and, since he could not test the new valve he installed, Jake showed me how to check it.  He said if there was any leakage to call him and he would come right back and fix any problems.  I know the complication with the city's valve made extra work for him, but I was not charged any additional fee, and he got me a $50 discount coupon because I called after meeting Dutton Plumbing at Starbucks.  I could not be more satisfied for the professionalism that Jake demonstrated, and his willingness to see the job through no matter what extra time or inconvenience arose due to outside complications.  Without reservation, I extend my highest recommendation for Dutton Plumbing because of the outstanding service that Jake provided.< /Review>

Response time is second to none.  I always get a call an hour prior to arrival confirming they are on their way.  This time when Ken got here the toilet was leaking (go figure).  He checked everything out inspection-wise and suggested we replace a few minor things which we could do ourselves and the charge was zero.  What other company does that????!!!!!<//review>

Marc of Dutton plumbing came by to hook up my barbecue to my house's natural gas.  Since this was a manufactured home the fittings were a bit tricky.  Marc and his apprentice James C took it all in stride.  Even though they had to go chase down some parts to complete the job they didn't stop  (unlike another plumbing company that threw there arms up).   Since, I've recommended Dutton to my neighbor with a washer problem.  These guys are the real pros!  Thank you Marc and James!!< /text>

<text>It was late morning on a Sunday when we had a water leak under our kitchen sink and  laundry room.  We were able to manage until late afternoon when the technician arrived.  Armando was clean, polite and responsive to our questions.  He also wore protective covers over his shoes  and used a  floor mat to protect our floor, which we appreciated.  Before starting the job, he explained our options and associated costs and did not pressure us in any way.  He was extremely conscientious and tested all of his work before leaving our home.   It was refreshing to have a technician who actually took pride in his work.  We felt the pricing was fair and would definitely recommend this company.< /text>< Pictures>

Dutton Plumbing went above and beyond our expectations. We had a slow shower drain for a few days then it erupted into a full on blockage that left us without service. We called at 7am and by 9am Adam was at our door. I took him right to the backyard where the septic was backed up at and Adam went to work. He was friendly, professional and knowledgeable. He made a few expert suggestions on how to prevent this from happening again and what may need to be diagnosis for future septic issue that will occur later due to age of plumbing system. Unlike my experience with other plumbing companies, Adam didn't try to pressure me to buy any unwanted or unnecessary repairs. He fix the problem and made some suggestions. I would highly recommend this company to any homeowner who is tired of being taken advantage of and who just wants great quality professional and on time repair. This is the company for you.<//Text>

<Text>We've been on the family service plan with Dutton Pluming of a few years now.  The annual service inspection includes a water heater flush, general pluming inspection and Bio-Clean drain treatment.  Our house is over 20 years old and has its share of plumbing issues.  To prevent these issues, Dutton Plumbing installed a pressure control regulator 3 or 4 years ago, but warned the hard water in the area would take its toll.  This year we had two more leaks.  We requested Luis Zamarripa as our annual service technician.  He is an excellent, dependable technician and he drives PINK DUTTON PLUMBING TRUCK.  10% of the profits from the PINK trucks go to the Susan G. Komen Foundation.
Luis recommended a whole house water filter to which we agreed.  He included the leak repair and did an excellent installation job.  We got an 18 month same as cash deal so it was very affordable.
Great job Luis Z.  Larry C. you have a great team!

We had Luis Zamarripa back on 9/12/18 to install a pre-purchased RO unit under our kitchen sink.  The installation concerned me because Luis Z. and Lon Ralston had to cut a new hole in the sink to mount the RO faucet.  The installation was perfect. No cracks in the sink, which is over 20 years old, and NO LEAKS under the sink.  I've been told that can be a common problem with RO installations.
Additionally, Luis and Lon, replaced our old dishwasher air gap.  We requested this extra work and asked for the air gap to match our upgraded sink faucet.  The match is a good one and the Luis and Lon's workmanship is excellent.

Dutton Plumbing maintains its 5 STAR rating in my house!</Text>< username>

An excellent employee and a hard worker.
I had what looked like an easy job at first but the guys who rebuilt this house put a lot of curve balls in for the poor Heyner.

Well he did not give up and kept on trying other solutions. All while my kids kept on asking if he liked monster trucks, cars, movies, horses, how old he is, what are you doing.
He replied always with a smile and got the job done.
Cleaned up thoroughly after the main job was and had time to talk options for payments and contracts.

Bravo!<//text>

<review>I am rating Dutton Plumbing POOR for price not for any other reason. A few months back...I was trying to install three faucets in my house when I found one of the old ones... "water flex hose" refused to come off....it's always something when I fool with plumbing. I didn't want to force it because then I would have to shut off the main. Sooo we were forced to call a plumber. We found Dutton on line and they came within 2 hours. Nice truck...3 guys...it looked like a trainer and 2 other guys. This was a very simple job...just remove the stuck hoses and finish putting in the faucets. When I asked about the cost...they referred to a large book that already had all costs printed for any kind of plumbing job. FOR My 20 minute job they would charge around $300....which is really insane!!! I think the only way for me to get the price down to around $200. was to install the faucets myself...while these 3 guys looked on and then they hooked up the water flex hoses  in 10 minutes....according to their book that would be cheaper???? ...incidentally after they left one of the bathroom sinks was leaking when the water drains....but I didn't dare call them back!!!  I will never call them again!!!< /review>< pictures>

I had several issues at my home including a main water line leak, a recirculating pump and an irrigation Backflow valve. Kevin Kalin fixed all of them in a very professional and expeditious manner. He was really impressive in locating the main line leak and fixing it.
Dutton Plumbing is always responsive and sends the very best technicians to the job. I will use them for all my plumbing needs and especially recommend Kevin.</Review>

<Text>Brett P and Tyler dug out and capped a buried gas line at a city Public Works yard. They saw-cut and jackhammered asphalt, then dug down 2 feet to reach a joint and place the cap.  This was a physically demanding job that took a full day. Both guys were great.  They worked safely and efficiently, and never complained.  They also cleaned the work area thoroughly afterward.  Brett's equipment was in good shape, and neatly organized in his truck (I always look for this with contractors). I would hire them again anytime. Thanks!<//Text><Resp>{'time': 1468436281049, 'text': 'Thank you, Alexander! We’re happy you were pleased with our plumbing service.

O K guys ,,,, let us have people to perform trades like Mark and we will all be survivors of the mass of lying "contractors" that take our money and provide promises for tomorrow.
Mark an his worker SOLVED problems that were out of their realm of or scope of what they were called in to work on.
This is usually only found in an owner''s work ethic except the last 6 sbusiness owners that I have had over here for projects ,,,  requested prices well shall we say ,,,  we'll in excess of the going rate,,, as well as two companies which drew me in based upon FALSE weblistings......   claiming that they had no idea ..... yea right ....<//Text>

My technician was a nice guy, and very knowledgeable, and I would have liked to do business with Dutton, but his $1,150 estimate to replace a garbage disposal was ridiculous.  He also bid to replace a gas line on my water heater to the tune of $480.00.  I can only assume that Dutton puts out totally unbelievable bids knowing that a few customers will actually give in and pay their outrageous rates.< /Text>

I was so impressed with the professionalism and friendliness of Felix. He was knowledgeable about all the things I had concerns about. His answers to my many questions were clear and unhurried. Felix was able to complete the repairs my house needed and I was able to plan for upgrades of equipment I would like to install.
My house was built in the 1960's and I have wondered many times how I could protect my home from possible pipe breakages or who I could call if these "water disasters" occurred. I know that Felix and Dutton have my back. Thank you so much!<//text>

<rate>5</rate><text>Chad arrived on time, introduced himself, and was dressed in a clean uniform. He placed shoe covers over his shoes to keep my carpet clean.  I explained my plumming issues to Chad. He listened and repeated the issues back to me, to insure he understood my concerns. Chad inspected the parts in questions, he pointed out the problems, and provided me a short tutorial on the function of each part.

Chad provided me with several options to repair the damaged parts along with the final costs for each option.

The work was completed in a timely fashion and Chad left the area clean.  I was shown the new parts, as well as the old parts Chad removed. Chad was personable, professional, and I felt comfortable enough with Chad that I left him in my home alone while I ran several errands.

I would use Dutton Plumbing for my future needs and Chad represented the compony well.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Review>4.6 starts really, 5 if he had been lucky enough to guess to try clearing the clog from inside first instead of from outside the house, and if he had made it a little more clear there would NOT be any high-pressure sales pitch regarding what keeps causing our clogs.  Persistence paid off and a 30 minute effort turned into almost an hour as his second guess worked.
Mark arrived quickly, was very professional, was clean even though it was a 7 pm call, asked if we wanted a free scope run the next day to find out why we have these issues every year or two now, and only charged us the $73 basic fee for a clog with access.  They just left after the scoping and THERE WAS NOT EVEN A LOW PRESSURE SALES PITCH.  The Mike Diamond commercials sound OK, but Rusty Dutton beats their price and they both seem to have the same exclusions and conditions for unclogging drains.  MARK M. at Dutton Plumbing has our business to deal with. . .um. . . 'our business'.< /Review>< resp>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>Ryan was nice but the cost of my repair was way more than I was expecting it to be. A $22 toilet tune up ended up costing $297. My neighbor who is a plumber asked to look at the repair and said the parts were about $10 so now feel really ripped off. Very upset with Dutton plumbing and will not ever use them again!

I would now like to add that after speaking with an extremely nice man named Andrew, everything was made right  and am back to only paying the original $22. Am so happy that they took care of this in such a professional way and would now rate them 5 stars.

I need a 6th star for Adam from Dutton. We have a backup in a house sewer line at 7:30 in the morning. I found Dutton on line, read reviews choose Dutton. I called and told them that SoCal Edison was turning off the electivity at 9:00am in our neighborhood (that was in 1-1/2 hours) and that Dutton must arrive before so they could use their power tools. Adam from Dutton arrived with 20-minutes before power shut down and fixed the clog just in time (actually he had to rewind the router snack by hand...that's how close this was). I got a new plumber and new friend with Dutton!!<//Text>

After some confusion using the chat on the Dutton website I received immediate assistance from Olivia on the phone. Within minutes of speaking with her David Walker's info was received by email and text. David arrived within the hour and rectified my water heater problem in minutes. He then offered to service the water heater for less than the cost of a service call from a home warranty company. He cleaned the sediment out, checked all the gas connections and parts then blew any dust and creatures away. He was done in 45 minutes. I have used Dutton before and have been very happy with the work. I have always recommended them.< /Review>

Steve in investigated the system and then made the diagnosis which

<rating>1< /rating><Review>Consumer beware. I called Dutton plumbing for a leak in the drain pipe to my washing machine. The plumber looks at the job site and immediately tells me that the cost of the repair will be $2200.00. I was floored. Then after I told him that i would get other estimates we couldn't get him to leave.He kept talking about this and that and when he found out that we had a cat he talk another 30 minutes about how great cats were.I did find a legitimate plumber and they did a great job. The cost $240.00.

Had home service yesterday and was very lucky to get Ryan J.
as your  rep.

He was extremely professional and was obviously well trained
as he dealt with several issues that we had at home.

We were very pleased with him and would suggest he be anyone's
rep from Dutton Plumbing.

< Review>
I want to thank Dutton Plumbing for the work performed at my house. Every aspect of the experience was first class - from setting up the appointment (your office staff is excellent) to Kevin Kalin and his crew arriving at the scheduled time.
Kevin's professionalism immediately put me at ease, he and Paul Belcher thoroughly explained what the job would entail, gave me a quote and competed the work that day as promised at the price they quoted, no surprises. Great job!

Thanks Brian S (and your sidekick Romero) for the good work. Friendly, competent, and professional, from first to last.

<rate>5<//rate><text>I am not sure where to start because I have had half of the Dutton field technicians here at my home over the past 3 weeks.  I live in a home built in 1965 with old galvanized pipe under my tri-level home in my lower bathroom.  This pipe had completely deteriorated and not draining at all to the street sewer line.  My technician assigned to my overwhelming project was Diego Magana, under his manager Paul Belcher.  This crew managed to get me financing in order to move forward with  correcting my plumbing problem.

Over the three weeks, they worked with me on scheduling the time to get the job done.  My home was their concern and they were very careful to see that the area they had to work was kept as clean as possible while they jack-hammers my lower level floor to get down to the pipes for replacement.

My thanks go out to not only Paul Belcher and Diego Magana, but a big thank you to the workers that dug the 4.4 foot hole, then the refilling and and getting the bathroom back to  the its former order.  They did a great job.

Some of these workers are:  Miguel, Edgar P., Edgar B., Manuel, Luis and Noel.  I hope I got all the names of those that were here and I hope I did not miss any names.  A big thanks you to all.  They all did a great job!!!!< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1513700738724, 'text': 'Thank you for your 5-star review Nancy! :)'}<//Response><GmapID>0x80e82ebed5b30749:0x6a99858c7f6e0140< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I had to have a water heater replaced. I called about 4pm on friday night. Kevin Kalin from Dutton arrived less than one hour later. He was accompanied by another tech. Kevin explained what had to be done and gave me an estimate. Both Kevin and his helper were professional and informative. The workmanship was excellent. Before they left, Kevin said if for any reason, I had any problems, to call right away and it would be attended to. Should I have further plumbing needs, I will call Dutton Plumbing.< /Text>

<Text>Bryan C from Dutton Plumbing came to our rescue today!  Our plumbing was clogged - affecting 2 bathtubs, 2 toilets and 3 sinks.  We called Dutton plumbing and Bryan was at our house in about an hour!  He assessed the situation and flushed the lines.  Another field team member came to help thread a camera through to find the problem.  Unfortuntately, we got an estimate for a big job that needs to be done but we were aware of our home's plumbing issues and were expecting it.  Through it all, Bryan was super courteous, knowledgeable, professional and friendly.  We would definitely recommend both Bryan and Dutton plumbing!!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

This was my first time using Dutton Plumbing and I didn't know what to expect. Well, Bryan Castenada and Dutton Plumbing superceded my expectations.  This was the BEST service from a vendor I have ever had.  From his moment of arrival to Bryan's departure, the service, knowledge, professionalism and character was more than excellent.  I never klnew service people of this caliber still existed.  I would recommend Bryan and Dutton Plumbing to everyone and they would be foolish to go anywhere else.<//Review>

<name>Novak Inc.</name><Review>It was a disaster. i had requested only preventive maintenance for main drain. Technician came on 9/30/2017 and three days later I had a drain completely clogged. My guess that Manuel T. (tech. name did the cleaning in dry or did not get to the street level. Anyways when I called the Dutton Plumbing about this emergency they sent to me the same guy and he suggested to me to change the drain. This advice I am getting for already 15 years because there is a crack in the pipe. Not much to add, he was not up to helping but rather trying to proof that he did a good job in the first time two days earlier. I am greatly disapointed with Dutton and would like share this experience to help somebody and avoid this so called "plaumbing service"

< Review>
I had Dutton Plumbing do a complete Main line replacement and water line replacement including new tankless water heater's at my 4 Plex rental property.  Chad Schull was lead Technician with Paul Belcher as Dutton Plumbing  Management Technician.  I was able to count on Chad and Paul to make sure this large job was done quickly and correctly with the least amount of inconvenience to Tenants at the Property.  Chad worked after hours to insure Tenants had Water and hot Water with only a few hours of water shut off.  I had excellent communication from the Company and with Chad and Paul as to all factors concerning the job.  I new upfront what the job would intel and how much it would cost.  Dutton Plumbing stands behind it's work and I have a 20 year Guarantee on parts and labor. I believe it is well worth the cost to have peace of mind that all work was completed accurately with a Guarantee.  I would highly recommend Dutton Plumbing Company to anyone and especially to someone that has a large job and needs a large crew to come in and complete job quickly and have it  done right!</Review>

<review>We had a drain backup in our shower. We called dutton plumbing and they offered to send someone in 15 mins. That was too soon for us, so they worked around our schedule and sent a technition when it was more convenient for us. When Ramiro showed up he immediately handed me his card and told me his name and that he was with dutton. He wore the shoe covers and came with me to inspect the drain. Before beginning work he confirmed the price we were quoted over the phone. He worked efficiently and professionally. We had an excellent experience with Ramiro and with dutton plumbing. Very professional.</review>< Pictures>

<review>Called Dutton Plumbing (Simi Valley) for a sewer main clog. Dutton cleared clog but but their lead plumber, Sean Goldate, said I needed sewer main replaced $14,000+. Next, Sean from Dutton said he found a bathroom tub leak and he would have to rip-out the vanity and wall to get to it, he wanted $4,000 to fix this. DUTTON TOTAL WAS $18,000 TOTAL. Got a second opinion form Jim Beck Plumbing. FOUND OUT SEAN FROM DUTTON LIED ABOUT THE SEWER MAIN - MY MAIN WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION (PVC MAIN). JIM BECK ALSO FIXED THE LEAKY BATHROOM TUB. JIM'S ENTIRE BILL TO ME WAS ONLY $150. Dutton Plumbing of Simi Valley (owned by Eric Dutton) RUNS A VERY UNETHICAL OPERATION. Dutton plumbers are cheats and liars. DON'T GET TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF, DON'T LET DUTTON NEAR YOUR HOME!<//review>< Pics>

I would like you to know how pleased I am with your technician Larry Gohen.
Mr. Gohen is very knowledgeable, answered all my questions and left the work area clean.
Before leaving Mr. Gohen explained other services your company provides and thanked  me for my business.
I look forward to doing business with Dutton Plumbing and Mr. Gohen in the future.

I had a leak inside my bathroom wall. That particular problem had happened before and had been repaired by Dutton. Unfortunately i was just out of warrenty. The plumbing tech Brett P. arrived within his appointment window.After a little conversation Brett realized I had used Dutton for other repairs (new water heater, outdoor pressure valve, clogged drain, shower leak) Brett/Plummer called his field supervisor and got permission to honor our exp warent. I had not told Brett, I was thinking of switching service as Dutton can be pricey. Brett came in kept our house clean, was clean and personable himself. he  broke through the wall, repaired our leak and and cleaned. the he did was neat clean and done right. Brett if you read this thank you. Your work and presentation has kep me a Dutton customer. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. Thank Dutton</Text>

<Time>1374676815808<//Time><text>Called Dutton office at 7:00 AM, they said someone would be there between 9-11, no problem, then got call saying they would be there in 30 mins, they showed up almost 45 mins, again no problem.

The plumbing problem was a broken PVC pipe in the Meter box, easy to get to.  Well my Father was a plumber and I spent many years helping, so I know whats involved, this is a 15 minute, job 20 if you run into roots.  The guys showed up from Dutton in a nice new van, in pristine white shirts, carrying what looks like a doctors bag. I tried not to laugh out loud, wondering if they realized they were plumbers not doctors.  I told them they would not need all that its a simple pipe repair.   They then took about 10 mins to write up a estimate which was $816.00, but he was very proud that he was able to save me $134.00 and that's how he got it down to $816.00.  I told him he must be mistaken.  When he looked at me as if i was stupid I told him to take his fancy bag get back in his truck and get out of here.  That I am happy to pay a fair price but that was ridiculous and that I hope they don't rip everyone off in the same manner.

BTW Gordan Taylor Plumbing came out right away did the job in about 15 mins.  and I had him tend to a few other issues I had been meaning to fix like my R/O filter system under my sink, check my pressure regulator, test the pressure on the house, check a gas line to my fire pit. WOW I am sure when Dutton would add these other items I would have to take a loan out on the house to pay their bill.  BTW Gordon Taylor Plumbing did the whole job for under $200.00.

The odd thing is the guy from Dutton did not even seem surprised at my response I guess he hears it often.  I never got a call back trying to explain or appologize.  I realize companies are allowed to charge what they like, but at rates like that I am fearful for the people who don't know any better.  I had heard of a senior citizen who had them change a water heater for nearly $3,000.00 and I dismissed it as urban legend as that was just crazy pricing and who would pay such an amount, but now i must wonder if this was a myth.  I have been told their Plumbers work on a commissions.

I have used Dutton before and they were expensive, but this time they were crazy.  They have lost my business and have earned a special place as I will tell everyone of my experiences.  I wonder how many people they actually take advantage of like this.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80e82ebed5b30749:0x6a99858c7f6e0140< /Gmap_id>< user_name>

< Review>
I called in the morning for a leaky faucet repair and a garbage disposal replacement, a fair amount of business for one service call.  I was told it would be no problem to get someone out by 2:00 or 3:00.  I chose 3:00.  At 3:15, the office called and told me it would be a little longer, but they'd be here by 4:00.  At 4:20 they called and said it was going to be impossible to get some out today, but they would be happy to put on tomorrow's schedule.  I waited all day, cleaning up a leaky kitchen faucet, to be told they weren't coming.  Not good, Mr. Dutton!  They seemed "disappointed" that I was going to all another company,  Wow.</Review>

<text>We had a major water heater failure this morning so I searched the web for a firm to replace the failed one ASAP; Dutton Plumbing popped up first. I called and described the problem; Dutton promised to help ASAP and would call back soon. They did both and two techs arrived sooner than expected. They diagnosed the problem quickly, described options and immediately ordered a replacement. The new water heater was delivered within ninety minutes and in the meantime the Dutton techs removed the old one and prepared to receive and install the replacement. The whole job was done as rapidly as I could reasonably expect. The techs were professional and competent. We're pleased.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1468340083439, 'text': 'Thanks, James! It was our pleasure serving you.

They are a complete rip-off. Brought them in to fix a small leak on an exposed copper pipe. They replaced 9” and charged $510.00. Later on, they offered a no charge inspection of my sewer system. They came with an estimate of over $7000.00. When I asked for a complete report as to what is wrong with the current system supported by photos, they started to give me the round around. I will never use or recommend them. As evidence of the excessive profit, they make on people, They FDEX me a very expensive box of chocolate chip cookies. I rather be treated fairly then get cookies from them.</Text>

Not good. I asked for a water heater replacement under Mfg warranty, they offered me $1 water heater replacement under warranty with $2000 Labor cost. I asked them to give me water heater and I can do the installation myself, they put me on hold for two days and was told later, Water heater warranty expired because house ownership changed. What a joke !!!</review>
