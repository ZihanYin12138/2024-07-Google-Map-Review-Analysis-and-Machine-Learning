<Text>Very nice to visit, famous sai baba temple in bay area. Place is very calm and all devotees were following silence and well disciplined. They served free prasadam on Thursday evening. We went there by 6PM and that time it was empty and getting crowded after 7.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2vPJ0CKkue-E4Z7sG5QPZ2qZ1aXCuRqgIc4vw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFBTeg06-z1ZnCu_bhW-cOmDE-miE7DT0zMvkF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxC5foR8y-zkd7yS_JzH32VNpj8JLAcoV42AW8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkhsDLt0mR8iO-qpP54eUKYAiBnJNLz0Op3qEP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNno-yOQ1GlBjwdKBm9-q_lHj1kyzNq9v1-_LOd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOv4cUfVB0o_PheNfkgF4yQ0XvlbgtWw-iVKP6L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNz5PTyIQmU4hv7G9Duee1ehsK90knL0n_rHBGl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMeMNPBvcmat6f4BN-Rh2FMYZGE7XfBCuOds2nl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPe8vzW43xZwapBpNgcZptOqBGaOX4x7BNNVJ7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBxV3YcDodMi7wUlG0POAH-QqkL4AOdeQxWHRK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Rate>

However one suggestion I do have is if the amazing staff and volunteers could play the om namo namaha song more often, since I know it loved by many people.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1604976169945, 'text': 'Sairam Hrishik ji, thank you for your kind words of appreciation!'}</Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fc8b8a8b1e331:0x60ababdb54c6cb0< /Gmap_id></record>

<time>1551206461444< /time><rate>5</rate><Text>There are so many great things about this Temple. For the people from India it feels like home. It's a family away from family. They have classes for kids which we haven't experienced yet. They have great worship place which feels so peaceful. Also there is a kids library and free food. They do a great job in disposing trash correctly! One recommendation from my side is please clean the carpets and floors more frequently and if you can post for people to bring their own cutlery/spoons it will be so much better for the environment or using steel spoons would be perfect if someone can provide and wash them as a service! Even I can donate spoons if you start this service please!<//Text>< pictures>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I visited this temple 3 years ago. The experience was so pleasant and peaceful, since then I go on every Thursday. There are 2 aartis in evening one at 6.30 PM and one at 8.30 PM. Attend any one of them, you will get a chance to do aarti yourself. Very nice and kind management. All volunteers are friendly. Do visit Dwarkamai and Chavdi located next to Dining hall. Atmosphere during aarti is so energetic, you will feel like Shirdi. Om Sai Ram.</Text>< Pics>

The place is so clean & well kept.  As soon as you enter the temple you feel so peaceful , calm & happy.
Everybody is just doing either meditation or singing Bhajans..  No gossip.   The volunteers are doing amazing job & always smiling.<//Text>

This is a place to worship Sai Baba of Shirdi.
They have a huge prayer hall, a huge dining hall, rest rooms, special event or private event hall that can be rented. They are open 7 days a week, Thursday prayers are supposed to be special.
Parking lot is a bit cramped .. if it is on Thursday evenings or weekends when there are special engagements<//text>

Love this temple. It is so huge and clean. The main area has good amount of seating and people line up pretty neatly to get darshan. The food area is huge with good number of seating area, cooking area too is equally big. Volunteers always service prasadam with a smile on their face.

They have so many events going there on a regular basis. They have classes for kids, adults, and seniors. Their parking lot is usually full but one always find a parking spot around the temple.

They have a year around food donation drive going on, which is great. And there are a lot of programs throughout the year to help people. God bless them for amazing work.<//review>

This place serves lunch starting at 12:15 Monday through Friday and they have a food bank you can get once a month there it's also a good place if you have a rent or electric bill that you can't pay and you can show it to an emergency sometimes they will help or even a bus ticket< /Text>

Hands down the best restaurant in San Francisco ! The Chef is a god with food and the bartender is incredible.  The service was exceptional.  Elegance and romantic atmosphere, minus the live karaoke guy in the corner.
Will definitely be back and recommend this place to all.<//text>

I loved the ambiance of the restaurant. Two levels of fun! They have A few different areas for dining. We actually sat on the rooftop level and it was a wide open space. It was so beautiful and warm from the heaters they had. The prices vary from what you order. We had steak, chicken, crab cakes, sides (sharable) & drinks and for 4. The bill came to 483 gratuity included. But we still tipped ☺️<//Review>

<text>The service was amazing. I took my bestie for her  b-day they went above and beyond. As we eat we watched our car being broken into. They held our food while attended to the car. Comp our desert and nice glass of champagne for out trouble. Amazing food. The butter cake to die for.  Just an amazing restaurant but the outside surroundings are the slums. Definitely not a cheap date< /text><Rating>5</Rating>< pics>

< Review>
Steaks and drinks excellent. Service on point. Management was aloof and not as professional as the experienced staff. The bartender was rude to my date, post meal which left us walking away sad. We spent over 500 dollars for the two of us, including 15 for every side of butter not included with the meal. Lobster mashed potatoes are soupy. I commented to the manager who insisted they are supposed to be soupy. He also made it clear he's afraid to criticize the chef. I've been in the industry for almost 30 years. Auto-gratuity hurts the staff. Just being honest.< /Review>

<pictures>None</pictures><Text>I never take time to post a negative review, but in this case I feel it is warranted. The service was subpar, the food was brought out cold (twice) and everything was salty. Even the desserts were undesirable. I would only recommend this place for drinks and the sorbet. While the managerial staff was kind and accommodating, it did not make up for the overall experience.<//Text>< user>

<review>The food was great! The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Indoor seating is Covid-19 friendly with the business at 25% compassity. The menu is some what pricey.  During this partial opening the menu has been revised. No sushi, no seared tuna and no Bone marrow to name a few. I was told that they would start to serve it again in a couple of weeks. We'll see. There is also a 20% service fee included to your bill during this partial opening. All in all, with the great ambiance, food and drinks I will definitely be back and I definitely recommend.< /review>< pics>

Celebrated my birthday here. Sat in the rooftop semi-outdoor space. It was a bit cool as the skin went down, but still a comfortable experience. We started with cocktails (good), crab cocktail appetizer (ok. Seemed previously frozen) and the bone-in filet, bone-in ribeye, sauteed broccoli, and lobster mac and cheese. Overall tasty meal. They surprised me with a complimentary slice of cheesecake beautifully decorated. We also ordered the butter cake which was amazing. We will certainly be back!<//review>

Great outdoor dining option in times of covid. Great cocktails, exceptional wine offerings and a world class steak with tons of sides to boot. Seafood offerings are second to none, fresh and worthy of constructing your own custom tower. Welcome to San Francisco. Cheers<//review>

<Text>Best dining experience of my life!

Shout-out to Kristina- answered all my questions, was friendly, attentive, and the perfect waitress all around.

The drinks alone are to DIE for- house infused vodka?! Yes please! I had a cosmo and lemon drop, highly recommend.

The food was unreal! I had lobster bisque, their mushrooms and mashed potatoes as appetizers. The meal was a rack of lamb with truffle butter, my dates the twin lobster tail. It was delicious!!!! We had butter cake as desert- and oh my goooodddd! PLEASE get it! It's un-frickin-real! Live music, which was awesome btw! Thank you so much to the ENTIRE staff- awesome meal, and an experience I'll remember for years to come. Decades even! Will DEFINITELY come back when I have another pretty penny to spend. ,💚💚💚😊< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x808581e76ab80ee9:0x20d6791cd5ff982a</gmap_id></record>

Phenominal food with fabulous service & an elegant, moody atomoshphere. Maestros is the bomb for steak houses in SF.. Lounge over dinner with fabulous drinks and with a savioy wine list. We had buttery New York Strip, Rib Eye with bone, fresh asparagus and not enough room for desserr. Truly a gift in San Francisco.  Last reservation is 10pm and it's quieter during Kovid</Review>

Hands down the best steak I’ve ever had, it is pricey but is definitely worth it for the cut of meat you get! The service was also second to none.< /Review>

This is my wife's favorite restaurant.  The service is outstanding, fun atmosphere, great music.  Be ready for an "eclectic" crowd.  But that's kind of fun.  The steak rubs are just next level.  Done flawlessly.  It's expensive but it's so worth it it's not even funny.< /text>

Mixed review. The food was mostly excellent except for the lobster mash potatoes, it is definitely not what the picture online portrays & mgr responded Oh we jazz it up for the internet. It was dark so used the phone light to check the lobster quantity & mgr decided to comp since it was disappointing. First upscale restaurant I ever been to that charges for first basket of bread then the rest is on them, took 30mins for 1st basket & never brought a second after requested. However my steak was delicious & sautéed spinach. Maybe I'll try them again just a different location for sure.<//Text>

Didn't make reservation for a Friday night but there weren't that many people so got seated right away. We came here for their famous hot cake. We had it in their LA location and it was so so tasty. Did the one in SF match up? It was tasty but a bit lacking. It didn't taste as fresh because the cake part wasn't totally soft and moist, and it came out a tad colder than we remembered it to be. We still managed to finish the giant cake and it satisfied our sweettooth. In addition, there was live music but the genre of music did not match the ambience of the restaurant.</Text>

So good. The sides are definitely great for sharing and the food is insanity. I got the lamb entree and practically sighed or moaned after every bite.
Also, right now cause of covid, its only rooftop/patio seating. But honestly that was great. Came in at 7pm and one person had the sun in their face but it was low enough to not be within 15 minutes.
Would definitely recommend if you want to try and celebrate when celebrating feels impossible due to the pandemic.</review>

< Review>
Honestly I am very shocked by the Google rating of this restaurant, considering that they DO NOT know how to cook a steak properly. We have been in quarantine awhile though, people must have forgotten what fine dining looks like. Don't bother wasting your money here. My friend ordered a $140 steak, medium rare, and it came out medium well, almost looked burnt on some parts. Instead of making a new one, the staff tried convince him that he doesn't know what a medium well looks like 🙄 . They basically refused to replace it even though he was very unhappy with it. Terrible service. Also this company refuses to refund for the steak, and does not respond to customer phone calls or emails. For the $500 wasted here, we could've went to Gary Danko.< /Review>

<review>This is my third time at Mastros. My goal was to support during Covid and they totally missed the mark.
They over booked and under staffed. Food came out cold, cocktails were ordered and didn’t come out for 30 minutes, it was misty and manager wouldn’t close roof even 1/2 way, bathrooms were disgusting and customers were not observing the mask rule in the waiting room and the hostess was not enforcing!
Very very disappointing for those of us expecting an upscale experience but receiving sub par evening.<//review>< GmapID>

Troy, the bartender/waiter was so excellent and really made the night! He went above and beyond in service. Whoever manages/owns this place should definitely take care of him! All of the staff were excellent and food was absolutely delicious. We had the filet steak which was tender and perfectly cooked, and steamed broccoli which was refreshingly not over steamed, and the fries were amazing. The butter cake was insane and huge, I won’t need breakfast tomorrow.
Thanks for a great experience!<//Text>< time>

< Review>
Amazing steakhouse with fantastic service.  The seafood was fresh and flavorful. Server put together a seafood tower featuring crabmeat, shrimp and snow crab legs. Presentation on point. Good list of cocktails and wine.  I ordered heart of the rib eye it was cooked to perfection. We had a table of 7 and ordered all of the sides. Skip the scallop potatoes. The lobster mashed potatoes are where it's at.< /Review>

<Review>We went to the newly opened Mastro's for a birthday dinner.  Unfortunately it was a rather disappointing experience.  The atmosphere was just okay - background music was a bit too loud.  Service was way too chatty and over-attentive for a fine dining experience - I prefer staff who is attentive from afar and quickly available with a glance/signal, rather than constantly coming to the table and interrupting conversation.  Finally, the food was mediocre at best.  The salmon was oddly soft and watery and lacked flavor, which was especially disappointing considering this Mastro's touts themselves as a seafood restaurant.  I don't see us returning in the future.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Main appetizer was the  Sauteed shrimp which came cold the sides were lobster macaroni and lobster mash were very blah in fact the lobster mash gave one of my friends in upset stomach and was really fishy service was also an issue in the beginning was fantastic toward the 2nd half the meal they forgot to bring extra dressing as well as another basket of bread as well as my wine which they completely forgot to bring which later on the end of giving to me for free but after the fact being that the meal was already done even the butter cake tasted burnt at the end I was very disappointed nothing like mastros in Beverly Hills.</text>

1 Star = Do not recommend
2 Star = Do not recommend but there were      positive aspects of the experience.
3 Star = Would recommend
4 Star = Would recommend ++service OR ++ food OR ++ ambiance (2 of 3)
5 Star = Would recommend ++service AND ++ food AND ++ambiance (3 of 3)

So the new Mastro's in SF is all about the hype and they definitely come though. Rediculous ambiance and service to back up the food, you are definitely getting your money's worth at this awesome high end steak and seafood restaurant. I've been to other Mastro's locations and this one ranks highly amongst the chain.  The attention to detail and food execution was impressive. Gluten free items are in abundance here and since they serve a la carte, ordering gluten free couldn't be easier!  By design, appetizers and side dishes are meant to be served family style. We went with lobster mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, and steamed spinach. All awesome choices and very complementary to the main dishes we all chose.   Mastro's is known for their steaks right?  So I ordered up a Kansas City strip (basically a bone in NY strip). Bone in, changed the entire flavor profile of the strip for me and took it to an entirely different level. They asked how I would like it cooked and they hit it exactly as I asked for, medium with red in the center (a true medium).  Mastro's also serves A5 wagyu at up to $300 bucks a cut, but I know what I can appreciate and the strip I ordered was absolutely delicious.  We didn't order seafood during this visit but I've had the signature seafood tower here before and if you are up for awesome chilled lobster, crab, oysters, shrimp etc, this is a must have.  We corked our our own wine but the wine selection is never ending here, and they have a great selection at various price points to fit what you are looking for. Very attentive wait service but not overwhelming at the same time.  5 Star for sure.  If your are looking for high end quality food, awesome service and fantastic ambiance then this is the spot to go to. You don't just stumble across Mastro's SF, you plan on going there....<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>I will highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a really nice upscale dinner without getting a coursed meal.
There is a strict upscale dress code.
Making reservations its ez by phone or online.
The cork fee is 40 dollars for a 750mil bottle.
We opted to bring our bottle of Dom perignon witch if purchased on side will run you for $300
So I payed $170 for my bottle plus $40 cork fee and saved me a few  bucks.
Prices are to be expected high, and average tap for 2 with a few cocktails a few appetisers 2 antrees and dessert will run at about  $300+.
We had 2 appetisers, 2 cocktails, 2 antrees, 2 side dishes and a dessert.
Our bill was 375$
Here is a list of dishes ordered.
Roasted bone marrow.
Seafood tower.
South of France cocktail.
Elder flower martini.
Filet 8oz.
Bone-In Filet 12oz.
Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi.
Rosemary Garlic Sautéed Mushrooms.
Butter Cake.
The Bone marrow is really good an will recomend it to anyone willing to try something new. How ever the one we got was a bit gamey. I have to say I had better but I would still recommend it.
please note that the seafood tower is fully customisable and they will plated on a tower with dri ice on it witch make it really cool and hazy I recommend if your trying to impress your special someone or if you just love sea food we got shrimp cocktail which is 3 jumbo size shrimp they are extremely fresh and succulent also got 2 king crab claws that I would not recommend getting due to their small size your better of getting the king crab legs.
The 2 cocktail we got were really good and would recommend trying them out.
The filets were good but I wish I actually had ordered the Bone in ribeye.
The side dishes were delicious and huge they come on a big hot saute pan which completely kill the hole upscale dinner experience in my opinion.
I mean here we are sitting with this really nice dinner on a beautiful set table and the they bring out two big sauté pans and leave them there on the middle on the table personally I would recommend the sides to be plated on a nice side dish patle or some kind of small cast iron plate but that's just me.
Over all our experience here was amazing and the food was great along with really nice and friendly staff and professionall service.</Text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x808581e76ab80ee9:0x20d6791cd5ff982a< /GmapID></record>

If you’re looking for a fantastic steakhouse with quality steak, amazing service, great ambience and satisfaction for the premium price, KEEP LOOKING.... Most overrated restaurant and dining experience in SF. I had high hopes for Mastro’s. They have some serious kinks to work out in this restaurant. I have never waited so long (nearly an hour) for a table when a reservation was booked in advance. It took 30 minutes to get drinks after we put our order in at the bar while waiting. By the time we got seated and our orders came, we literally spent 3.5 hours in this place and we were only 2 people. And the most peculiar thing is apparently the VIP bread basket is the most exclusive item on their menu. It literally took 30 minutes before we finally got a bread basket, despite my multiple check-ins.

Management has not spent enough time educating their staff on the menu or the wine list.

The ambience was almost like walking into the set of a ghetto music video. Why is the music so loud and obnoxious? Why does the decor look like a high end brothel? For such an expensive restaurant, this place has ZERO CLASS and poor ambiance.

The only positives here were our table server had a lovely personality. Unfortunately, poor management and operational inefficiencies make her job very hard.

Food wise, I don’t find the product worth the price. I ordered a fillet medium rare. It was ok at best. It was dry, had no tenderness, and was over-salted. The Brussel sprouts tasted like the grass growing in my backyard with some salt poured over it. There was so much cream in the mashed potatoes, I thought I had drank an entire gravy boat after two bites.

Drink wise, if you’re going to charge $20+ for a cocktail on the rocks, use a single clear ice cube. That is standard at most cocktail bars when ordering an old fashioned or similar cocktail. Mastro’s used the same ice in the cocktails as their water glasses.

Additionally, the design is poorly done. For a massive two story restaurant, there should be a bathroom available on each level. Also, at this price point there should be valet parking.

Every steakhouse in SF is better than this one, including your own house with a cut of grocery chain store meat on the grill.

Save your time and  money. Go elsewhere.< /text>

Very bad experience here I 100% got ripped off bought a couch and when I took it back because of it being uncomfortable they promised they’d hook me up with a better one they ripped me and my wife off. Had me pay for a bigger couch and gave me a smaller one with a “no cash return policy” said my new couch was all wood. That was bs. Only come here if your wanting to be ripped off<//text>

<text>I unexpectedly discovered this store and didn’t expect much. But it turned out this was a great store to shop for beds and couches. I bought a queen size mattress with a frame and it cost around $300.

The owner is honest and conscientious. He asked me how long I anticipated I would use the new mattress and recommend the one I bought. He didn’t try to manipulate me into buying expensive mattresses, which surprised me and made me believe in humanity again. Lol.

Because I live nearby he delivered both the mattress and the frame for free! I’m glad I’ve finally got a comfy bed for myself. :)<//text>< Date>

<review>We went to quite a few furniture stores, and this one was our favorite. The price was great and the owner, Glenn, was exceptionally personable, helpful, and answered all of our questions. He didn’t pressure us and he seemed like he genuinely just wanted us to find the right couch for our apartment. He personally delivered the couch the same day purchased. Definitely check his store out if you’re in need of furniture or a mattress.<//review>< pics>

<Review>I went in today with my 2 month old son and 10 year old daughter.
I was worried because I've been to other furniture places that weren't very happy to have children in the shop.
Glen was incredibly kind to my kids and made sure my 10 year old felt comfortable.
Hes very knowledgeable and really takes his time to help you.
Very friendly service.
He answered all of my questions and didn't rush me at all.
I got a mattress, the boxspring,top mattress, and frame for a very reasonable price!
They have financing options that is really simple to set up.
The entire experience was under 30 mins,which i love because I didn't want to have a long trip with a young baby.
He offered very quick delivery and I'm extremely happy with their service.< /Review><user_name>kristina Marie<//user_name>< pictures>

With more customers in the store then the amount of people available to help we like to always make sure everyone is treated equally and feels taken care of. Although every customer deserves equal treatment no matter what order they come in, this was a very unfortunate, one off,  rare circumstance and again I apologize for how it made you feel. With all do respect I offered to leave the customers I was with to help you while you were yelling,  leaving the store. I’ve discussed with him and coached him on how this situation could be handled better in the future.

Excellent service, especially for a one man op. He took initiative when our box spring was "scuffed in the move" before it even got to us and called to propose a rebate or an upgrade.
He was timely in the delivery and friendly.
During the sale, it didn't feel like he was pushing any extra bells or whistles. Lastly, great prices. Our quote at a different shop was actually double the price we payed here.</Text>

Don't waste your time or money anyplace else in Davis. The store is small but don't worry--the wonderful young man who runs this store knows exactly how to help you and get what you need. And the prices are excellent--much, much lower than retail. I got same day delivery and very prompt, on time and professional. I can't recommend this store enough.</Text>

Easy, fast, and quite a pleasure to do business with. A slew of choices and very easy and quick to try all of them out-- very cheap prices too for the quality of mattress that you get.

I walked into the store having a vague idea of what I wanted, and by the end of my trip I had a mattress that was within my budget and far superior quality than what I initially had in mind.

Would recommend this place over the others in Davis, hands-down.< /Text>

Extremely happy with Glenn and his professional customer service! My mom had spine surgery and was in need of a firm mattress and after 4 months of pain, she slept on her new mattress that Glenn recommended and she feels great!!!! It's so nice to see her feeling good again. I would recommend mattress express to anyone 👌🏽</text>

Any business will have a selection of models all differing in price based on quality. The cheapest was not what you were looking for and apparently you did not want to spend more and that’s completely ok. What’s not ok is slandering my business. Our reputation and dozens of five star reviews speaks for itself. I’ve reported this review to google and asked them to remove it. I wish you nothing but the best and best of luck finding what it is you’re looking for.'}</Resp>

False advertising, he’s trying to high ball but posts low prices you get you in. His mattresses don’t start at the process he says.</text>

Shopped around quite a bit in Davis. Wound up buying a $400 full mattress here which seemed to be a better value than at the other places we shopped. Other places offered special sale/student discounts to get to the $350-400 range, but were for what I think were lesser/thinner mattresses. And no special order needed, the one we wanted was in stock and available the same day. The salesman was nice, no rush, no upselling, which was not the experience we had at the other shops we checked out.< /text>

We realized that I order the wrong sized mattress after Glenn had delivered the mattress to my door and Glenn just went back and grabbed me a different one! It was almost a block long walk, and Glenn didn't even ask for compensation. This kind of person deserves all the business he can get.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>If I could give zero stars I would. I went into the location and requested no bread. (For dietary purposes) I asked if they can put my food
Into a salad bowl, the lady next to the man who I was talking to, intervened in the conversation and said, “no they can’t do that but they can put my food into a water cup.” When I proceeded to ask them questions like, “why would you use a water cup if I’m paying?” Then she said, “she can put it in a soup bowl but will charge me for a soup and salad.” Why, I asked if I’m not getting both products. , “one employee ignored me and the other one proceeded to move on to the next guest.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Thier was a fly landing on the food yet after I mentioned it to the employee they still served it to the customer behind me. I would think they wouldve thrown it away after mentioning it but they continued serving it even after I mentioned it.</Review>

Nice little Subway, they have the usual options and it's clean.

The servers are fast and friendly, the spot is great if you're about to enter the highway<//Text>

<Review>Sandwich was great the only thing I didn't like is how long it took to make that sandwich and to charge me for that sandwich they only have one cash register and it took forever just for they can charge me and I was on my 30 minute break and and 10th and half of that time I was waiting for my Subway</Review>< Name>

We ordered the orange tofu and swear and sour chicken, both as meals. All I tasted was sugar. The orange tofu and sweat and sour chicken were very similar and mostly just relied on an extreme amount of sweet for flavor. The Orange tofu did have a little spice. The actual chicken in the sweet and sour chicken was cooked nicely. The egg roll skin was underdone inside and gummy. The rice was bland. The soup that came with the meal was extremely gelatinous and smelled weird, although it didn’t taste terrible. I had to throw it away because the smell was making me sick to my stomach. We did eat some of it so I’m giving it 2 stars but for the price I would expect something more than mostly bland food in sugar sauce. If I want to eat a bunch of sugar, I’ll get dessert. I say this as someone with a big sweet tooth who likes sweet foods. Sugar has it’s place in savory food but if that is the only flavor in the dish, then it’s a really lazy recipe. Panda Express is much better as far as flavors and value go. Glad we had a coupon but still hugely bummed at how much money we wasted trying this place. I’m sure with some relatively minor changes the food could be much better.< /Text>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Oh how I love the food from Magic Dragon. I stumbled upon this place a few months back when my friend suggested it. I was visiting from out of state and we were having ourselves a movie night in my hotel room across the street. The food added so much to the night! So delicious and left us full with leftovers that we finished the following day.

The food was so good that it become a staple during my visits. My friend and I always stop by for some orange chicken, beef & broccoli, fried rice, and chow mein. Staff is quick and friendly. Food is also reasonable priced. I’m writing this review from out of town and wishing I could get some Magic Dragon tonight!</text>< pictures>

<text>I gave Magic Dragon 5 stars.  When other Asian take-out places give one serving boxes, Magic Dragon gives 2-3 servings, depending on portions.  The food is delicious.  I especially like their Orange Chicken.< /text>< rate>

My husband just waisted $40.00 on food that tasted and smelled like expired fish even though we did not order any! Pork fried rice and chicken chow mein should not taste like rotten fish or the noodles and rice! Very poor quality!  Save your hard earned money and go else where!  Had to give 1 star in order to comment.  Really a big fat Zero!< /Review>

San Francisco Bay Area has the best Asian Cuisine in California, but I am extremely pleased to have found a place that makes me want to come back for the food.  And the food is quite delicious the next day when all the flavors have set in.  Hope when Covid-19 I get the chance to dine in.  Read some of the reviews on the dine in experience....hmmm...I'll have to see for myself, but they will only get one chance.<//Text>< Resp>

We've dined at Magic Dragon a couple of times for lunch, and we had positive experiences both times. The restaurant is clean, comfortable, and spacious, and the servers are friendly and attentive. The dishes are typical for a Chinese American restaurant, and they do an excellent job with the frying, i.e. not overly greasy or breaded like so many Chinese restaurants. We recently ate the orange chicken, it wasn't overly breaded, and there were nice big chunks of meat. Service was quick; they brought out our soup right after we ordered. Lastly, prices are very reasonable. The lunch specials were all well under $10.00 for a complete meal!< /Text>

4.75 🌟! My only complaint is the bao was a little on the tough side.  The food is so good and delicious! It's always fresh and hot. Even when they forgot the fried rice they immediately offered to have their driver bring it to me or I had the option to to get one next time at no charge. I chose next time and it was not a problem! Thank you Michael!<//Text>

Leena provides the worst service
The food is great no problem there. First we waited 5 minutes to be seated until she decided to come to seat us. And then once she took our order I asked about a dish and she had an attitude and said there’s a picture in the menu. I let it slide whatever. But then when we paid I didn’t leave her a tip for her bad service. She then said the tip isn’t included in the receipt. I told her where in the menu or receipt did it say we have to leave a tip. She then said everywhere you go 15% tip is recommended. I said yea I tip but I don’t want to today. Then she proceeded to ask if it was the service or the food. I told her it was her service that’s why I wasn’t going to leave anything. I left her my $3 change and she said you don’t have to leave tip if you don’t want to, while she had been giving me a whole speech that I had to leave her one. I left the tip and said don’t worry I will write a review. But I’ve been going at least once a week on my lunch for the past month because the food is good and I had had another gentlemen as my server he was nicer. But definitely be prepared to be stopped before you leave to be forced to leave a tip or else...</Text>

The Hot and Sour was very tasty but it was so Bloody hot I could not feel my tongue. The Chicken Green Bean was nice , they gave me alot of chicken.  My husband ordered Mongolian Beef they again gave alot of meat. We have had better Chinese food. I  felt there should have been more sauce with our dishes.  We ordered their Egg Rolls they were mushy and tasteless.  Don't wast your money on them. There service was very nice. A very sweet young boy cared for us. He was kind , patient, and he had a great sense of humor. Would we go back there? Yes, but not alot. It is ok Chinese food but not great. But it's something and worth going at least once in a while.</Text>

Worst service. For that they Billed a service fee of 20% without mentioning anywhere in the Menu. Which (Service fee)  I refused to pay.

We went for Dinner Menu where Fried rice was Burnt. 😤

Please make sure for Extra charges without notifying the customer

Overall bad customer Experience<//Text>

Got our order very wrong, requested shrimp removed from an item for serious allergy reasons which was not done! I fortunately noticed on time and did not suffer any serious adverse reactions but be very cautious about this<//Text>

The staff was friendly. Very clean, comfortable and quiet even during the lunch rush. The only thing we did not like to much was the corn in the Miso soup. Never seen anyone do that before. I will definitely return on our next visit though.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqWU2UW7vcEpPzNRN1m-rGWB6LEz2Gmima0Uxy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

The food is pretty consistently good. I wouldn't say it's amazing but it is definitely some good Chinese food and reasonably priced. Try the Bao if you haven't it's pretty good.< /Review>

Great service, food quality, and price would be the way I titled this review. I love eating here, clay pot or freshly prepared entrees, this is the spot to visit on the central coast even if your staying at Pismo Coast Village.< /Review>

Right across the street from the Santa Maria inn. You can order each of the entrees as a meal, to which they add the soup of the day, two wontons, anegg roll, a fried shrimp, and some rice. the portions are huge. The service is fast and nice. The food quality and taste is above average in every respect. We will certainly return when we are in the area. I highly recommend this restaurant.< /Text>

Great Place

We had a variety of plates and each of them were absolutely amazing.  Little pricey but good food and the service was supreme.  In the Santa Maria area I think it's about the best Chinese restaurant around.  Also the service was great couldn't get better.
Reason for the 4* rating is due to the prices, again, a little too pricey...</Text>

<Date>1371567868078</Date><rating>4<//rating><Review>Really liked this place. We went with my wife and two young teenage children. I was skeptical at first because it looked a little too tourist-y and there weren't that many customers there, but my first impression was wrong -- very wrong -- and I'm glad that it was! The decorations look a little worn, like the restaurant has been there a while and could use a few touch-ups, but the booth seats were comfortable and the lighting was bright enough but not overbearing. Maybe the locals don't frequent the place simply because it's been here a while? I don't know; they certainly deserve more business.

The menu is a mix of Chinese and Japanese cuisine. We ordered a mix of soups including egg flour and hot and sour; both were very good. In fact, everything we ordered was very tasty. The vegetables were not overcooked and the meats were tender and flavorful. We enjoyed a few dishes family style, and everybody enjoyed all the dishes.

The wait staff was extremely well mannered. Every time he put something on the table, he would present it with a little hand flourish, presenting the dish to the diner. It's a little thing, but respectful gestures like that add to a pleasant dining experience.

Would definitely go again. I really liked this place!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I usually get take out,  but the dining room is nice as well. Walnut shrimp, orange beef, and won ton soup are my faves.  Get won ton soup take out late, and the chef loads it up with goodies from the evening prep.💙💜< /Text>

Went for lunch and absolutely loved it. The Customer service was friendly and the food was not to long. Delicious meal. The restraunt was clean and well decorated giving it an authentic experience. Lots of space and clean restrooms. Orange chicken was divine and the price was both reasonable and worth it. 👍👍👍<//Text>

I chose the orange chicken because I'm boring like that. My mother got the kung pao beef. Both meals included soup, salad, eggroll, white or fried rice, and the entree. I assumed since it was so cheap it would be a rather small portion so we ordered the cream cheese wontons for another 6$.< /review>< Pics>

Went to dinner with my mom and was hoping for some Asian cuisine with some good flavor, so I went to Magic Dragon because it had good reviews. When I got there many of the employees were wearing pajamas and there were children running around,but, I continued to order I ordered the fried won ton and the veggie spring roll as an appetizer and some hot tea to drink, the appetizers were good but the tea had no flavor. For the main dish we ordered the Mongolian beef, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Veggie Chow Main, and Fried Rice, with the exception of the Sweet and Sour Chicken non of the Items had any flavor. We will not be coming back to this restaurant in the future and I won't be recommending it to anyone.<//Review>

We love this local Chinese choice!  We have been going here and ordering delivery for 10+ years, it is always tasty, completely classic, and has excellent varietal menu offerings.</review>

Wonderful place to come get fresh made Asian cuisine. It's quiet and relaxing. A plus for me is that they have real stainless steal chop sticks instead of those yucky wood chop sticks. Food is served piping hot :)< /text>

The best Chinese and Japanese food in town! Their California rolls are delicious, as well as a nice size, compared to other Japanese restaurants in town. Defiantly try their sweet and sour chicken and lemon chicken. The customer service is outstanding and plus they deliver! I have never had any issues with them. Check them out, you won't disappointed.< /text>

<Review>We👏were 👏so👏 impressed👏!! We had fried dumplings(8) and Pork Bao(4) for appetizers and they were so so good. Hot, full of flavor, and a great portion size for the price (5.95 and 6.95 respectively). Then we split two entrees and had plenty of leftovers (needed two boxes). We tried the Kungpao trio and the Black Pepper Chicken. These were the best versions of these dishes I have had in a long long long time. They were so delicious, fresh, the veggies were cooked so well, the sauces were so flavorful, and despite the meats being cooked in oil, they were so clean and didn't come off as greasy at all. They poured the blk pep chk on a steaming hot plate right at the table.
Keep in mind rice doesn't come with the food. But a "small" bowl of steamed rice (which is PLENTY for one person) is $1. And fried rice is $1.50. Or they have a combo for 3 or 4 bucks that includes rice, and spring rolls, and soup, and like three other things I can't remember. Anyways!
Best Asian Food I have had in Santa Maria or SLO. Huge portions, great price (with both appetizers, sides of rice, two entrees, and enough for lunch tomorrow for both of us, the total ticket was $40.80 before tax/tip) and absolute amazing food.
The restaurant is a little slower paced. So come here when you want to chill and eat some amazing food. The staff is so so kind! Kept our waters full, double checked the order with us, and boxed our food.
10/10 would recommend. And we will be back next week!!!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80ec6c8275e487e3:0xc0ddff65fc94dfcb</GmapID></record>

If your ordering for an office lunch please be wary. When we ordered the boxes were not labeled  plus our orders  were not correct. Also our order took longer yhan an hour. So just make sure you double  check  your order.

Not a big fan of Chinese food, but the Magic Dragon was good food. Veggie udon soup  was very tasty, kids had orange chicken and it was just right not over sweet. Everything we ordered was very good.<//text>

I could not give any stars for this food. I was excited to try something new and different. then I tried it. over priced, over sauced (egg foo young). I could not recommend this. and I will not be back. my $43 meal sucked I could've gotten better and more somewhere else.<//Review>

We ordered a  verity of food items for New Year's Eve to try. The Kung Pao  Chicken was the best! I'd go back just for that. We found each item to be flavorful and distinct. The Moo Shu Pork was also very good. This was a take out order. They got it perfect. They were fast, the food was hot and the staff friendly and helpful. We look forward to eating here again in the New Year!<//text>

< review>
Had lunch there yesterday. 10/9. Food lacked flavor. Kung Pao chicken lacked flavor. Tasted like stir fry vegetables and VERY STALE pieces of chicken. No sauce on the dish. I had heard wonderful things about the food. Maybe I had an off day. I love Chinese food and know there are different ways to prepare the dishes The waiter was impatient and he didn't stop by to check on the foid. The restaurant was not busy. I felt unwanted. I guess just an off day.<//review>

<Review>Friendly and attentive server. Food tasted great. We ordered cashew chicken and General Taos chicken. Good sized portions. We did the combo and that is a huge value add which I recommend. I love that the chicken is white meat also and not just random mixed parts. We will definitely be coming here again.</Review>< Gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) A really nice asian restaurant, good food and priced okay.
Nice ambience and endeavors hospitable staff. Around 22h, the cashier leaves the building, after which it is still possible to sit, but nothing more can be ordered.
Really highly recommended! (one of the most underrated restaurants)!

< Review>
Used to go there for  3 entire football seasons to watch my Patriots from 2013 to 2015 when the bar was called Last Call: same location similar bartender staffed. Homer Brady my main man a Raiders fan is still tending bar there. Last two football seasons I stopped going there on Sundays because I finally got DirecTV NFL Sunday Ticket and I watch my games at home. Still drop in and say hello to some of the guys there,  always had a television dedicated to my team,  even would let me have the audio on my television for the entire bar for just me if there weren't competing customers, good Guinness draft prices at $5 a pint, and best of all Scotty used to cook breakfast with sausages eggs and pancakes 1 year for $5 and the next year they had a food truck guy outside. Friendly, unpretentious neighborhood bar. They also have live music nights which I've always wanted to attend but haven't yet... Certainly the best bar I have found in City Heights, although the Tower Bar and the Til 2 are places I also want to check out. Mostly for the live Rock music.<//Review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>I have been eating here since it was originally opened as East Coast Bagel by Patty many years ago. They have always been good but I must say that the current owners are doing an excellent job. The bagels have a slight crunch on the outside but are toothsome and chewy on the inside. I love the jalapeño cheese bagel toasted with cream cheese! The staff is always friendly as well and you never have to wait too long. If there was a better place I would go but there isn’t. If you are looking for a great bagel, go no further. This is the place.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c332b5d4b7fdcb:0x48674e44d49db8</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

We arrived at around 1 PM. Most of the bagel selections were either gone or depleted. As they close at 2 pm, I highly recommend that you arrive early for your bagels. Their bagels are chewy with a nice outer crispiness. We will definitely return!<//Review>

I stumbled across this place during a delivery. They made my day. The guy recommended this turkey avocado bagel thing and it was delicious. Will definitely be back when I’m in the area.< /Review>

Truly, you will not find better bagels ANYWHERE! Even from the bagel chains. I promise. Every kind of bagel is available, but you’ll be surprised to find that the plain bagel is truly awesome. Yes, kinda like eating vanilla ice cream at 31 Flavors, but treat yourself to one on the side of whichever bagel you each first. The cream cheese is light, whipped, and creamy 😋</Text>

Super chewy bagels, chewy on inside and out. You can fold them like a taco.  Be sure to have it toasted if you want some crunch.< /Text>

< Review>
The bagels here are so incredibly fresh and delicious. I haven't had a better Cheddar Jalapeno bagel anywhere. It's a shame it's 25 minutes from my house.< /Review>

These bagels are THE BEST I've ever had. It's hard to eat bagels anywhere without comparing them to these. Love their cream cheese!!<//review>

< review>
I have never had a raw, uncooked bagel before. Thanks! I was hoping for that experience. The second half of the bagel made me gag in my car as I was driving. Had to pull over and wait for the nausea to pass. Needless to say there was a lot to throw out. Stomach noises all day, all for $2.95! Thanks again!<//review>

I love this place great bagels always fresh. The taste is better than Panera.  Great service. I usually place my order before and it's always ready.  I order the 13 bagels baker dozen cause you get a free bagel.<//Text>

< Review>
I've been to the flagship bagel stores in Chicago, LA, and Detroit, and this one is my favorite, the portions are perfectly sized to turn a bagel sandwich into a quick meal. The quality and freshness are supreme and the taste of everything else just melts in your mouth, small, local, fresh, and friendly. There was only one worker when we went and it got busy unexpectedly, we thought he may've been the owner because he was working so hard and keeping everything neat and clean at the same time, definitely coming bac<//Review>

<Review>This place took forever to help us the are not good at multi tasking. They even helped someone ahead of us that walked in after. He seemed to have an order placed but we were in a hurry also. So don't come here if you are in a hurry. Bagels are ok.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80c332b5d4b7fdcb:0x48674e44d49db8<//gmap_id>< rate>

This is my neighborhood dollar tree. Can't go wrong. Sometimes it's busy, others it's not. Just like any other store, especially during the pandemic. I typically always get great cashiers here. Always very friendly.<//review>

It is usually pretty easy to find what I need here.  Today was the same but they were low on balloons.  Other than that, the staff is pretty helpful and the store is pretty decently stocked.<//Review>

This dollar tree is a mess you litterally need to shut down the store for one day to clean it up. I know it's customers that made the mess, but at this point it's so junkie it looks like we had a 8.2 earthquake or somebody was trying to relive the Rodney King riots. Anyway, please clean it up and organize. I can't even walk down the isle. I'm a teacher but I get a month off for Christmas, hire me for the month and I'll clean up and organize for you....geesh.</Review>

I like the large parking lot in the back of the store. I also like that the door that faces the street is blocked!  As I walked into the store it's very bright and roomy. They only had 1 cashier open but he was quick! Overall it was a good experience.< /review>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>I was just at this location and the service is HORRIBLE! I was being rang up by this employee named Jesus and he overcharged me on a couple things. There was a long line so I tell him, charge these people first and then you can give me my refund. So I’m waiting and waiting. He keeps letting people get in line and leaves me waiting for almost 10 minutes til I finally say something when I see a lady walk up with a lot of stuff. I was kept waiting to only be told that they don’t do refunds & I had to pick items to make up for the money. Irritated as I am, I go pick the items and when I get back to the register Jesus says that the items I got aren’t equivalent to what the charges were. Once again I was forced to get items I didn’t even want better yet intend to pay for. I would never come back to this place again. SERVICE IS HORRIBLE AND THEY DONT MAKE UP FOR THEIR MISTAKES. Oh and Jesus looks like he hates his job and couldn’t be bothered to at least have some kind of personality. Shouldn’t be working in service homie if you don’t like it!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

The sales manager Edgar at store 04995 is very rude and unprofessional I took an hour drive to this store that I Googled to look for two items which I went to a different Dollar Tree and the store manager gave me a listing of different stores to go to in the car she also gave me the SKU numbers of both items that I was looking for however I walked into the store I asked him if he could look at these item numbers he told me no that we can walk to the floor and go look for them I said the last time we did that the lady actually had a dozen of glasses in the back and on the floor even though we didn't see them there I also then asked if he could to look up the item that I was looking for just to ensure that they didn't have any in the store c h a u n t e asked if she could assist me and the store manager Edgar told her no and nope I did I raise my voice at Edgar that I cussed at Edgar was I unprofessional at Edgar I didn't say anything disrespectful or rude to him but can you please utilize the hand help that dollar tree has provided for you to look up two items that I needed she again started to apologize for not being able to assist me and I explained to her that is no problem you did the best that you could and I was going to follow a complaint due to Edgar not wanting to do his job as the store manager again thank you so much for helping me but this will be one dollar tree that I will never return to and I assure you that none of my family members gay if they do live in this area they are never shop here thank you I hope we someone from Dollar Tree reads this and does something about the poor service at this Dollar Tree store number 04995 and I was in here to buy 18 cases if they had them of item number one 57327 and 10253 for 18 cases of those if they have them</text>

The store was a bit messy.  The front entrance had an overflowing garbage can and there was garbage thrown everywhere. The customer service and the cashier were great but the store needs help merchandising.< /review>

Bad way of running things give customer a update every so often don't let them sit in there car Wondering if you forgotten them and don't tell them a time of it's not true. Was told it would be 25 mins waited more time. Bad way to run things even with covid-19 going on.< /Text>

I wish I could recall the name of the gentleman that helped us. He even set us up with a military discount when one of the other stores we'd stopped at prior was aggravating and we left without completing our business. If you decide to go tmobile I'd say this is one of the nicest most helpful of the ones we tried and recommended.<//Text>

Disappointed about how long their wait. I scheduled an appointment and waited 2 hours. Reason why we scheduled an appointment was because we were told that by a Tmobile rep "no wait" with a scheduled appt. They need to improve their wait time.< /review>

<Text>5 stars to this location and staff and 1 star to t-mobile itself!!! This location of t-mobile has the best and friendly staff. They’re very helpful, going outa their way trying to sign you up, but t-mobile company sucks!! Ya, tried to switch from Verizon to t-mobile and I couldn’t, because someone fraudulently had 2 lines under my name with $120 outstanding balance, so they couldn’t port my numbers.<//Text>< user_id>

I purchaed two phones here last June of 2015 and the salesman was so helpful. I was awed with his willingness to help me. I stayed there for a while and got 2 phones, an iPhone 6 and 6 plus. When it's all done and I was about to go home, he told me to just come back for the contract after one week. I got the contract after that but didn't mind to go over it because I know I got the right deal. Little did I know that when it was almost 2 years that I though it will be paid off, I got a written notice from t mobile that I leased the phones and I have to go to a store and they will set me up for the payments so I won't get charged with a much higher bill. I went to a store in LA, he set it up and explained to me that I'm paying the same amount of the 2 phones I got. And what now? I just called t mobile customer care and they said I still owe the 2 phone $216 and I already paid $1700.00 for both. Watch out folks with these salesmen that sugar talks you. Always be sure that you're purchasing your phone otherwise they set you up with a lease contact. I can't wait to get out of this BS T-MOBILE scam....<//Text>

< Review>
The people at the store were nice but unfortunately they did not pay attention to details in regards to their contract. I had mentioned a few times that I had took advantage of their reimbursement program about a year ago. They assured me (Robert assistant store manager) my phones would still be paid off and everything would be good. Well when we did the reimbursement program it failed and when I called support it was due to me already using the reimbursement program less than 2 years ago. So if you’ve done the reimbursement program under 2 years you obviously cannot do it again. But that was not highlighted to me. Everything was supposedly “going to be good to go”. Well it wasn’t, and now since I left my Verizon plan I voided my BOGO for my other iPhone X.... The store was nice enough to give me my activation refund but in light of this I feel like that should of been done regardless.... now I’m screwed on paying full price for both my phones. That’s what I get for assuming retail people know their contracts and not looking it up myself...< /Review>

I've been to this store in 3 different occasions and every time I've been waited on by 3 different associates. I will not go to any other store my experiences with Elizabeth Shields and Abner have been very pleasant. I've walked out of there satisfied they have been friendly and understanding, I was a customer of the biggest and largest carrier for over 15 years and not once did I received the type of customer service I've received from this store, very happy<//Text>

The people who work there only care about making sells, they have no customer service skills and try to sell you items that you don't even need.  I was there for over two hours I walked out with the wrong phone and phone number, I ended up returning the items they sold me the very next day and on top of that I had to pay a restocking fee of $50.   I prefer going to the store near the mall they have a better selection on phones, more knowledge about the service plans and the wait time is much shorter.</review>

<Review>We went here after I talked to a customer service rep online. We knew what we wanted and were told a price but we had to go in the store. I don’t remember the name of the individual who helped us but he was not helpful at all. At one point he said something to me and I had to quickly correct him because he was rude.  He quoted us a price that did not make sense, after running my credit because they won’t deal till they look at your credit. Well the price was different than what I was quoted, my husband asked him what about the bogo deal and he looked at me and said Teri you should have said you wanted that deal. After that encounter I walked out because I knew I was not going to get a good deal if he was not going to tell us about the sale prices. I took my business to another place. Buyer beware and look into their sale prices before you go in because they will not give them to you unless you ask.<//Review>< pictures>

Carolyn, (a poor excuse of a manager) was the WORST! Don't waste your hard earned money at this location! Go see Roberto and Amelia and T-Mobile in Victorville. Solved my issue in minutes when Carolyn rude and unprofessional self would even listen to what I had to say. She even hung up on the service rep that I was forced to call since she wouldn't bother to listen. Even asked me if "I was done" or "If it was her turn to speak" while I was trying to explain my issue. If I could give her a negative number of stars I would!< /text>

Complicated, not professional , not well trained customer service, too many service areas with problems like bad reception. Messages like "Mobile network not available" and when you call nearby area code phone number  many times you receive message: "no registered on network " ( even including my own voice mail, and my home phone number). Their service overall is really going down in the past 3 years. Im being customer for more than 11 years( i know what i"m taking about) finally: their are testing my patience way beyond acceptable.<//Review>

<name>Jacob Brown</name><pics>None</pics><Text>Not having to deal with this terrible place makes paying Verizon $150 more per month worth it. Nothing but horrible experiences and they never actually did anything for me other than waste my time and take my money, with an emphasis on time wasting. The manager, Carolyn or whatever her name is, as many have mentioned before is a sad excuse for a human being , a horrendous manager and is almost the entire reason I took my 5 accounts (0ver $2400 annually in revenue) back to Verizon at great cost to myself. A few of the highlights  from my visits were witnessing her kick a printer in front of a store full of people since it wasn't working, once I was having a conversation with her and she just walked away from me and started helping another customer as if I did not exist, and the numerous times she passes a task on to another employee and storms off to the back room when presented with any sort of rational thought. The store obviously has no say in how they handle customers and refer everyone to their convoluted phone support  which is about the same amount of help. If you are having trouble with your phone, don't expect them to offer any help as I have yet to see anyone excluding one employee able to use a phone either android or IOS. If you're thinking about visiting, do yourself a favor and shoot yourself in the leg... it'll be a more productive, pleasant experience</Text><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80c366e747859741:0xa0166b9e8cecd930</gmap_id>< Time>

I prefer this tmobile store because it's owned by tmobile company and is actually trained to solve your problems and try to help your phone out of glitches. If something that is out of their hands of course customer service is to be contacted with since it is limited work they can do as a tmobile store. Customer service is great! Can get very busy.<//Text>

Last year when my grandfather was dying Jocelyn the manager completely ruined my experience. A new phone had been ordered for me and was sitting at the store. She claimed I had received nothing and that the order was never submitted. I had to call corporate just to get my phone THAT WAS ALREADY THERE. Then with the rudest attitude she says, "Are you at least grateful you got a new phone?". JOZ, you clown, I don't have to act excited about something I paid for and waited an extra week for because you cannot read. Furthermore I left with only a phone. No charger, no headphones, no instructions. Jocelyn really came up that day. When she "synced" my phone she messed it up completely (if that's even what she was doing....doesn't take a genius so how did she mess that up?) and I spent the night fixing it. The only reason I'm just now mentioning this is because my grandfather was laying in a bed DYING at the time and I was just glad to be able to easily access my music again, which I played for him from my phone via Bluetooth speakers. I know Jocelyn did not and does not care, she made that clear. But I want her to know that once I did have my music back he was playing air guitar, smiling, talking, asking for drinks. You ruined nothing, as hard as you tried. How dare you take advantage of someone's grief by stealing from them? People, just go to another location. Jocelyn/Joz is a manager which means that you can't escape a miserable experience as long as she's around. I consider myself lucky because there were about 6 other unhappy customers but at least I left with a phone. Those people left ready to go to Verizon because Jocelyn is ridiculously callous and rude. Now that the haze of depression from close death has cleared, I intend to be compensated for what was stolen from me and the bad customer service I received. That woman knew she was dealing with a distraught person going through hell and rather than helping she took this as a chance to be ugly. Way to go Jocelyn.</text>

<Text>Worst phone service I have ever had. I have gotten three iPhones from them and every single one had something broken on it. They tell you how great their service is but you really have no service 99.9% of the places you go I end up having to use my girlfriends phone if we go anywhere for vacation and she has Verizon. Oh yeah and I'm never really on the internet or apps and they tell me I use 2.5 gb of data in one day. At the end of the day with all the hidden fees and stuff they tack on its the same price to go to Verizon. I can't wait for my contract to be up with t mobile.<//Text>< pics>

BE AWARE!!!
If you visit this store please pay extra caution to your receipts.

Employee Lizette Orozco, caused an error resulting in my boyfriend paying extra on his bill and wrongfully being charged for accessories & a device.
Recently I found the reciepts to further provide proof of this error but the Store Manager Carolyn Hastings could not assist me in resolving this matter.

Always be sure to get a thorough explanation of any "Promotions" or "Deals" offered.

These Sales Associates at this store are scammers.
They are very helpful at the time of purchase to be sure they can make you spend as much money as possible.

AVOID: Lizzette Orozco and Carolyn Hastings</Review>

Here is a little recap on how my going to pay bill and pay off all my phones went.......*mystical music plays as we are transported to the front of the store* I walked in and nobody greeted me or asked me what I wanted to do (there was like 6 people behind the counter and only 2 of them actually doing something) I walked up to one of them and said "is there a sign in sheet" she said yes and proceeded to look for a piece of paper for 5 minutes until she found it and put my name on it (princes bananahammock ) and 10 minutes later one of the guys behind the counter decided he wanted to do his job for a bit so asked me what I needed to do so I told him. He said my bill was $350 so I paid for it, then I said "I would like to know how much I owe in phones and accessories so I can pay them" he said okay and we stood there for 15 minutes while his "computer" decided that it wanted to not work (I'm pretty sure a roladex works better then those computers) and finally I got my list of phones+accessories,  total = $2789 and I asked him "once I pay this it means this phone is mine correct?" He said "No you have to pay and early termination of phone lease fee" and I said "that would have been nice to know" "he said "well now you know" glad to know I was going to pay $479 in early termination of phone lease without knowing, so I decided not to pay for the phones and just the accessories so that my monthly bill would go down to $295 *weird music plays as we return to wherever it is that you are when you are reading this*< /Review>< pics>

<Text>screw this stupid provider... i bought a nokia windows phone from them on a no contract plan. when i bought the phone i bought an extra warranty that the representative who was helping me told me covered my phone if it was lost or stolen. well just recently my phone disapeared. i called tmobile customer service and got some moron in india who i could barely understand. he told me that tmobile does not have a tracking system to track lost or stolen phones and that if someone tries to activate my phone after i have reported it they wont wont even notify me that someone is trying to activate my stolen property. then he proceeded to tell me that the extra warranty i paid for will not cover my phone if its lost or stolen. so today i called the actual store i purchased the phone from and they told me that my warranty does cover lost or stolen phones but i have to pay a $50 deductible. But unfortunately for me that doesn't even apply because apparently when i reported my phone my phone lost or stolen and deactivated it i voided my warranty. I will never recommend tmobile to anyone ever again. im astonished that this company still stands with horrible customer service like that... sprint or verizon are the way to go</Text>< Pictures>

Went in because my phone was having issues, they used a Diagnostic Tool and it fixed my problem right away! If you go there with a phone problem make sure they use that tool and your experience will be great!< /text>

I went in there with a 4g data problem I was lied to and told I didn't have 4g in my area when the website and tech support says I do. I will not recommend this store to anyone. Lying is one of the worst qualities a customer service professional can have.< /Text><response>None< /response>< userid>

The park itself is still open, and all parking is now free, so go support the local parks by visiting them when you can, get out, get some sun, and breath in some fresh air for a change.<//text><rating>4<//rating>< resp>

Nice place to relax outdoors and enjoy nature, along with vintage architecture. Lots of shady spots and picnic tables. Not busy on weekdays.</Review>

<text>Beautiful scenery. Safe space. Open dawn to dusk. Nice paths for biking or walking. Picnic areas seem to be off limits due to pandemic, but we can make up for it by bringing a blanket and snacks. Love Kelley Park! This place has history too!<//text></record>

Clean and quiet during the Pandemic. The lake in the Japanese garden was drained so the scenery is discounted but still nice nonetheless.  The parking fee of $6 is a little steep though...< /Text>

Been going here for years!!! Love the beauty, the relaxing areas, the BBQ pits and picnic tables, the trees, grass, and the mini colliseum-like area...slight hills along the paths, wide enough to walk with family and friends without crowding each other. It's always been a wonderful and delightful place to go for outdoor birthday parties and get-to-gethers!! It is so peaceful when you really just need a moment to reconnect with nature. 🥰💗🥰💗💗💗🥰💗< /Text>

So I loved how christmas in the park was done last year. The lights were beautiful!! The soundtrack was great! Me and my son had a great time. Yes there was an enormous line but it was so worth the wait.<//Text>

Went here for the Japanese Garden, but its Koi pond has been drained to be repaired. Overall the scenery would be nicer if there's water in the pond.< /Text>

We were here for Christmas in the Park. Nice display similar to Fantasy of Lights at Vasona. The only issue is that the logistics was pretty bad. They really need to figure out how to organize the entry much better. If they do this again next year I hope the focus on that as we waited for close to 90 minutes to get in and see a 30 minute show. Still enjoyed it.<//Text>

The park is open and in early March, parking was free.   Japanese Gardens are open, but the primary koi pond is dry.   Happy Hollow is about 33% open; lots of their animals  enclosures are empty.  You must make s reservation on the website.< /Review>

The disc golf course has come a long way.  Kudos to SVDGC for turning a homeless camp into a safe walking, biking, park with nice open and wooded holes.  The homeless camp is still visible across the creek from holes 14-15.  But the entire park is 1000% improved.  Thomas Wong FTW!</review>

<text>Amazing place. It's quite big too compared to the other Japanese garden in the Bay area. They have a big koi pond with lots of fish and a lot of other trees and flowering plants. This is a must visit place If you are looking for a relaxing place around the Bay area. They also have a big picnic area for get together. Only concern is the parking which is $6 on regular days and $10 on holidays<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNf3BmfdR738c7z1kNjiNNa7SwKliVjYzjnloLX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYnhVRACS8_ZLkp7P-3dfhhQXC5CBtIU9uSOwn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8riVTbzdtAVhGl3YQdYKLnfciGGoma8NCGSsh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqWSQkWyeCxAjY5XYKDqsiaWV8vmXS2xrWDoVM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMKi3dRt99HU6onHoyR0BIYA0tb-A_aBo2w5ZO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwtHe3zUlAz1s3_dk1Mqmc-1NqIJePdpHzAZ63=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM60O8w5eUgESv8urstdJpToxtgGaPYnZqDRNFa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNez7Rsng0G_cM4O91oKxrwgox74GW0HnWjdBJm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMH21jq5lwg4uW0BmAnu4hg1Wzet0ryyqshZtwV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPec7r3aCeb4KZZUovmNxKmvP3gr4CJ733ii_lQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQgn_PEH_bBw7UZEJfr-a51nVgf_krWR2eyVtf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmT6c2BURcaT5JNhtIJEKbHwcclkl0faTBe0zk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCcNf566ut9JnBWKEXMSb_SwBSOnPNLIUc3pGW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-WABjGsYa8a6vf6kXpm8ztQTIVKPBsHgHxYRD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZNvOCbzQo2gDuI1CLAtWqH7paAetPMn_ppdH2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPiMf_RJnCroAB8eY21UQ0Fs9bDhJnf789Wx4K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6IMQt99_iiHgH1IZBTgftwNzJiShrLuCglC4g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEtuf4xCA29TSdfBKSbeKVlJVu_grdLD4s4ZJ8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPV_HwD0u3WDd4ce8vvetf4zuHJMo2fQAdBzk5B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLHy9CfCjH5GieoKgs2VstutIV0DHM1FX-z9Sw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHs_ngv_HGi6WhIE5MXU2E8Vfir6n4_JUmivkR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x808e332c3c96029f:0xe92e99e53a338299<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I love Kelly Park. It is a very large and friendly place to visit. The Japanese Garden, the small zoo and Frisbee Golf course are all great little day trip activities. Have fun and I hope to see you there.</Review>

Went for the Japanese garden. Parking was $10, and the garden was under construction? Tea House was closed, all the water was drained. There was just some trees to see and paths to walk on. Overall disappointing- wish they could have updated their google page to reflect changes.<//review>

Most of Kelly Park is open but not the history center or Happy Hollow. Parking is abundant for drivers. We cycled to the park and meandered slowly along the winding paths being careful of pedestrians. Bicycles are not allowed inside the Japanese Friendship Garden, so we could only peek in from outside. The water features looked mainly dry but the grass was verdant and the trees looked healthy. Kelly Park is a fabulous space for families where kids can run and explore.</text>

<text>I wanted to visit Happy Hollow zoo and eventually went through this Kelley Park. The zoo was closed. But the park was open for public
A calm and a quiet place with vehicle parking facilities. There was an entrance through Kelley Park to Japanese Friendship Park.
Better place to read books without disturbance or a place to be with small kids.<//text>< pictures>

The Japanese Friendship Garden
with its diverse landscapes, tall
trees and comforting grass areas
invites young and old families to
relax and explore. Some families set up easy tents just for the day.
Restrooms and tables are open,
BBQs are not.
You will see; birds, turtles, coy, and
and so much more. Amazing
japanese landscapes in San Jose?
Yes it is vivid and true. Visit once
and you will never forget what has
been experienced. Awesome, clean
and very friendly. There is a
peaceful resident crane that moves
elegantly and will fill you with
wonder. Leave a dollar or more in
donation "fountain".< /Text>

<Review>Kelly Park, AKA Japanese Garden, is located in San Jose and well known for KOI fish. Picnic, birthday parties and wedding ceremonies are often hosted here. Some of the KOI ponds are now under restoration and so the park is kinda empty but in return it’s free parking at this time.

We had a wonderful time. I remember coming here over 30 years ago. Some things had changed not too much.  It was really nice to see the puppet shows, Danny the Dragon train ride. I think it's a perfect place to take kids 12 years and younger in my opinion, cause they would enjoy it more for the type of rides. It's clean. The staff operating the rides were patient with the kids and friendly.
We didn't see the Peting Zoo (they use to had a bunch of Billy goats that you could feed by hand) that was a bit disappointing so I'm hoping their just remodeling or moving them. I loved feeding the goats.
Enjoy your visit 🐐🐅🐆
Have fun 🐒<//text>

Kelly Park along with the history museum is hosting Christmas in the Park this year due to the covid-19 outbreak. I find it hideous and disgraceful that they charge 20 bucks a vehicle to see this event. Christmas in the Park should be free it always has for generations past. It's saddening to see that the city is profiting off of covid-19 and a traditional free event. Shame on you city of San Jose!< /review>

Review of History Park in Kelley park:
Upon entering the area i had this overwhelming feeling i was walking into a ghost town, it was dead and if the cars on the highway couldn’t be heard it would have been dead silent as well.
The houses are interesting and there are a lot of museums but little else entertaining to do. Great for a free and interesting walk if you are into that type of thing.</Text>

<text>A quick and well thought out 18 holes.  It can be a little difficult at first to know where the baskets are and the 18th hole is separate from the rest however it's a wide variety and super fun! Really nice people and feels safe with security driving at random around the park.  Look out for the baby skunks they are harmless and just trying to eat.<//text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<text>Such a wonderful place to have in the middle of city. Lots of grass to picnic or play on. Chickens and peacocks roam the grounds. There are lots of fun places you can rent for an event. Farm animals, cows, pigs, and goats can be seen. In one area if you have quarters you can get food to feed animals. My favorite part was the section of labeled fruit trees.<//text>< time>

<rate>4<//rate><text>I visited the Kelley Park in November of 2019 and have recently learned that it is also known as History Park and History San Jose, those other names were more familiar to me. Rather than trying to unravel the mystery (for me at least), I will focus on my experience and impressions.

Visiting The Kelley Park was indeed a revelation and an educational experience for me. The Park was well laid out and the grounds well kept which encouraged exploration. To better appreciate the park and it many sights and items of historic significance an overview talk was given by the staff member.

Exploration was encouraged and yes I definitely recommend the "Talk" in order to have a better experience. I would not give any spoilers but sufficing to say that it is well worth the visit.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Absolutely fascinating. It was an exhilarating time here with my friends. Loved the surroundings and the greenery. The whole setup was super fantasizing. The park features accessible routes and walkways. It's easy to locate and one of the most relaxing places to chill out the weekend. Best visited with family and friends.< /text>

The territory is well maintained and clean.
Parking is paid which is ok since it is big enough.<//text></record>

Attended the oblong sunset walk and the guide was awesome. Learned new things. Lots of mosquitos at sunset so use repellant. It wasn't very cultural based. The entire Japanese garden is dried up! Apparently the rain caused ponds to overflow and flood through the park and the fish- well they swam away into the creek!?! Everything is now dry and they are just starting to collect koi in a the very back corner.< /review>

Very disappointed to see that all the ponds were drained except for one that looks like there's no up keep .... Very beautiful and peaceful just was disappointed not seeing no fish and ducks or water under the bridge ... So to walk around and have a peaceful time and lots of greener yes .. Fish and ducks and water views you not going to get it smh< /Text>

<Text>Played Disc Golf.  Course is well maintained and really fun to play.  A bit hard in some places and too easy to lose a disc.  The park is mostly open but a few wooded holes are frustrating. Just like a course should be.
Unfortunately, there is a parking fee. No real reason for it to be a fee but there is.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

We went to the history park. It was a 1946 show this weekend. They had a big band, classic cars, and military vehicles and equipment. Interesting booths. Good show.<//Text>

This is a great place to bring young children.  The goat petting area was a real hit as were the rides. One nice feature of the park is that there are numerous shade trees that protect you even in the case of strong sunshine.< /Text>

My favorite place in San Jose. A bit of zen in the city and all the other cheesy sayings and cliches. The Japanese Friendship Garden is still beautiful, plus for a fee you can go to Happy Hallow. Great place for families or really just anyone looking to get out a bit but not travel far from home.<//text>

<review>Kelly Park is the central park area for San Jose. There are three specials parks within this park: Happy Hollow Park and Zoo, Japanese Garden, History Park. There are various places where you can go for walks with family or have a picnic.
But, unfortunately, there too many wild cats and homeless.
Park is accessible for people with disabilities.

Liked the exotic animals at Hollow park&Zoo, but the staff should notify visitors at entrance if some animals are temporarily removed. I was expecting to see the Anteater, but he was the one that was removed.
Great green place to spend a day in the nature but way too loud and overcrowded with children....Go to the park, not the zoo, if you want some peace and rest.<//Text>

I grew up going to Happy Hollow, and I love that I'm able to share it with my girls.  The group that helped save and renovate the park has done an amazing job.  All the old favorites have been restored, and they have added some great new attractions.  Make it a family tradition.< /text>

Special place for kids. They love seen animals specially when they feed them.
Plus they can go on all rides 36" and more. Lots of fun in here.</Text>

The only reason I gave only 3 stars is there was no water when I visited. It was on construction. If there was water, I am sure I would like to give them 5 stars. It was very nice to walk around with friends or family.</review>

There was only water in one pond, and that one was nasty and had all the koi stuck in it. The whole of the Japanese gardens had orange construction cones everywhere.</text>

You do always have to pay a $10 parking fee which is a bit of a bummer because not really any nearby street parking due to it being surrounded by popular main streets. Its almost like small hiking trips for kids because this is a very large park.<//Review><rating>5</rating><pics>None< /pics>< userid>

Still a nice park after a life time of coming here. Homeless population however is growing and makes it hard for family events sometimes. Lots of trash and intoxicated people or folks passed out on the ground or in a bush. You get numb to it after growing up here in SJ but my kids still love running around and it has so much space if you squint you can see past the grime.<//text>

Happy hollow is an amusement park and zoo for small children and families and is very friendly and fun. The Japanese friendship garden is amazing for photos and truly admiring nature. Both are great for the weekends, but the friendship garden is free, whereas happy hollow costs around 10 dollars per ticket. In addition, parking for the park is a flat rate of 10 dollars.</review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<review>It's a heritage park featuring original and replica historical buildings, culture, and items. It has a gallery next to the candy shop/cafe and it's actually a museum. Free admission, $6 parking (sometimes) and is next to a Japanese Tea Garden which you can visit at the same time. The Park is not really big and there are about 20 buildings maybe altogether. I went on a Thursday and only 2 buildings were open with docents, due to budget cut. Volunteers advised me to visit on a Saturday when everything is open and the trolley is running. Reserve at least 2 hours for visit. Lastly, it is 2 blocks from Little Saigon so one can always enjoy great Vietnamese cuisine with the visit.< /review>< pics>

Smaller that Gilroy Gardens so you can keep an eye on little ones--especially if you have more than one with you.

They have toddler through moderate thrill rides. Great playground too!!

Allowed to bring your own food and there is plenty of shade.< /review>

Happy Hollow it's great value for what it has.  Carousel and a couple other rides with no height restriction. A few more with minimum 36", including a small roller coaster. It's a great place to entertain young children for an entire day. A few animals and a petting areas to see when they are tied of rides.

The cafe has the basic American staples at a good price for a zoo or theme park. With yearly membership at $35-$45, depending on the number of people, it's great value.< /review>

Went to see the Japanese Friendship Garden and Koi Ponds. The Garden was beautiful but disappointed with the ponds not being fix. Come to find out it was flooded at 1 point and yet to be fixed. They should have posted this somewhere before I waisted $10 to park. If I missed the sign my apologies but that was the only thing I was really looking forward to. Hopefully, it will be fixed by the next time I get back there<//Text>

This place is truly an amazing adventure for your young child. I brought or daughter and niece here and they had an amazing time. It is basically a very inexpensive Disney land without the lines. Cost was around $11 per person with the veteran discount. They had rides, playgrounds, puppet shows and a petting zoo with non traditional animals. Definitely going back!< /text>

I live ½ block from here and love it. The zoo is great for young and old alike.The S.J. History museum is nearby (good for brushing up on your San Jose history whether you were born here or not), as is the community center, the Municipal Ballpark (Excite Park) where the S.J.Giants play, Spartan Stadium, etc. So much within walking distance. All centered around this little bit of country in an urban environment.< /Review>

Very nicely kept Japanese garden, except it currently runs dry and only 1/3 ponds have water in them. Would give 5/5 stars if there was water everywhere.< /Text>

Great place to relax and take the kids to have fun and see the animals (you can pet and feed the goats if you feel comfortable). Food is not that great but it will do when the kiddos want a snack.<//review>

<review>Friendly staff and a good sized park to go with it. Too bad the drought has taken its toll on the JAPANESE Garden. It shows signs of making a big comeback. Overall a Great Park with lots of room for a picnic or 2.< /review>< GmapID>

One of my favorite parks.. I love coming here to run or just relax and the view of DT is beautiful. Sometimes parking can be difficult on the weekends but weekdays is not bad. First time I came there was a line to take the bench picture so I had to wait a little bit but it was worth it :)</review>

The Japanese Gardens was a very nice place to visit,  serene. Only thing that was missing was the water  :(  We took family from out of state and were disappointed when no water was to be found and all the Koi fish stuck in a corner pond.</Review>

Wow, what a jewel of a place. Went there scouting for a project I have and was blown away by its authenticity. The place is well kept. Not too crowded which helps it feel more real; when you're there it feels like you're time traveling... visit. It is the best kept secret in SJ.</Review>

The disc golf course is one of San Jose's best kept secrets. There are certain locations where you really get an idea of what San Jose looked like 100 years ago. Thanks to the volunteers who keep up this great public space.</Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>Amongst the very best locations to unwind with children alone. A relaxed beautiful area with zoo. You got to inspect it out. The park that parks desire, and likewise a preferred book area for large groups. The large pavilion shades long outing tables collected with each other & many BAR-B-QUE grills. Artificial creek experiences the park, meandering under bridges, between 2 ponds with turtles & ducks. Children can wade thru the superficial creek (I recommend water shoes). My youngsters suched as standing on a bridge, going down leaves right into the creek & sticking to as the existing brought them downstream ... thrilled childhood years memories!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

This it was definitely a playground for kids. If you're just adults going it'll take you 30 to 45 minutes to go through the park. I love zoos so even without my five year old daughter I had a blast but I know if she was there I would have been there all day on rides, inside the Crooked house, on the playground, etc.
There are quite a lot of statues which are fun. Pretty large petting area with all sorts of farm animals.</review>

Great place for young children! We brought our grandchildren ages 6 and 4 and they enjoyed the day immensely, as did we! The price of admission was reasonable; the gift shop was a little expensive. Overall, it is a great place to bring the kids!</Text>

It's a nice park but it's under a lot of construction. The koi fish is towards the end. It use to so beautiful before with all the koi fish in the front. It's really dry now. Not alot like they did before. I hope it ends up being nice again like it was before.< /text>

This park hasn't changed that much since I was a kid. Except for the renovated happy hollow park and zoo. Volunteering at the Dia de Portugal was very fun.</text>

Many areas are being repaired or replaced. Japanese friendship garden inside the park  recently flooded so no fish in lower ponds until things get put back together. Still relaxing and beautiful and worth a few hours to unwind< /Review>

We were able to see the spawning behaviour of koi fish and the young geese would come close to interact with us. In all a very great experience.< /text>

<response>None</response><text>Nice park for the entire family, even for elderly folks with physical limitations. There are plenty of picnic tables and BBQ grills and enough shade for a nice summer family get together. There is a Creek towards the back side of the park, sometimes one can even spot a turtle in the water. A beautiful Japanese garden inside the park allows people of all ages to enjoy feeding the koi fish. Unfortunately, much of the garden was destroyed by the heavy rain last year and was closed to the public for many months.< /text>< Gmap_id>

Great recreational course. Nice formal setup with signs, tees and Mach baskets. Too bad the Parks and Recreation got greedy with the parking fee. Six dollars in too much for the disc golf Demographic. No research was done to establish a realistic charge for parking. Most disc golfers are young men and younger families in the working class, not the rich and famous from more endowed zip codes. The lack of amenities on site further challenges the higher fee. The property was abandoned used by homeless folks until recently and it will be years before vegetation is fully restored.

If the fee was dropped to $4 you would double the amount of park users or better while increasing your revenue from attendance, $3 is more realistic. The world class course at DeLaveaga Wilderness Park in Santa Cruz charges only $2 daily. Many parks charge nothing to park or have off site parking. The higher fee certainly impacts my plans to patronize Kelley Park.

One solution to better serve San Jose and Bay Area resident disc golfers is to offer a reasonable annual parking sticker, $50 a year let's say rather than the current amount. Forms should be available on site to purchase online or by mail.<//review>

<review>San Jose’s Kelley Park is a wonderful place for family fun. With Happy Hollow Park & Zoo, the Japanese Friendship Garden, San Jose History Museum, Portuguese Historical Museum, picnic areas, and lots more, everyone in the family will find something interesting to do.<//review>< time>

<Review>There's a lot to walk here. Plenty of trees and grass. The Japanese cultural garden is fantastically beautiful. You can even feed fish. There's a frisbee part that's fun too in the far back if you bring frisbees.</Review><Name>Patricia Gummo< /Name><user_id>103913923194446335482<//user_id>< Pics>

This review is for Happy Hollow. Low entry price, great variety of animals for kids to see, lots of rides and areas for little kids to play. (Food selection is kind of weak, so maybe bring your own and then picnic in Kelley Park).</text>

Small but picturesque and well maintained Japanese garden. Worth a visit. Bring quarters to feed the fish - except in the winter months.< /review>

Beautiful and well maintained park. If you stay on the well maintained trials you wont see much litter.

I had the opportunity to help clean up in an off trial area. After some flooding  there was a cumulation of trash along the river side after the waters subsided.< /Text>

Unfortunately, when I went to the park on a Friday, it was closed :( I didn't see this information on Google before leaving the hotel, and only knew when I got there, I found it a bit lacking in organization.<//Text>

Great for little ones.Need to be 36" tall for some rides. Plenty of greenery. The puppet show is geared for the younger ones. Plenty of restrooms. Very reasonably priced for the value.<//text>

Great place for outdoor photo shoot. Reason for only 3 stars is due to the safety. It’s always free and hardly you see anyone in the park. No play structures for kids< /text>

Very nice park with lots to see if you include the history park, the Japanese friendship garden and happy hollow, if you have kids. This park really is a San Jose landmark and I'm glad to see that it is pretty well maintained<//review>

<review>Also known as History Park, this park hosts some of the heritage of San Jose. Showcasing era homes, culture, and now art thanks to the Bay Area Glass Institute (BAGI) being hosted on-site. The railroad and old tyme printers are also cool places to visit. If you like history, culture, and art this is your local must see place.<//review><resp>None< /resp>< name>

It's a nice park for a group picnic. Be warned, parking is a little pricey (ten dollars per car) and the bathrooms are pretty far away by the entrance of the Japanese friendship garden. Think ahead when reserving space.<//Review>

Large park in an old orchard. There is a big disc golf course in the park. Not normally too busy. Note they are strict about the park closing at sunset, and if your car is in the lot the rangers will hassle you with. Parking is $6 but you can park outside and walk in.  The north side of the park/first 9 holes of the disc golf course  have very little poison oak, but there is some in the south part of the park.  Undercover is generally mowed pretty well here though, so it's more an issue if you have to look for a lost disc in the bushes.</text>

Forgot how much I like Kelley Park. So fun to go here, or the Happy Hollow Zoo, or see the Historic Houses or the Japanese Garden. I like it here. If it's busy park at the Ball Park across the street.<//text>

The japanese garden was closed due to storm damage. Will have to come back. Didn't see much "damage" when we went though. Looking at the garden from the outside, looks pretty big and pretty.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Park not much. I didn't meet almost anyone here. I was also in the Japanese garden, what regretted here was that I was looking forward to taking a lot of photos, but unfortunately the ponds were empty and the greenery was not very well groomed, not even a foot. Overall, it seemed too cramped for me. The rest of the park, too.

(Original)
Park nic moc. Nepotkala jsem zde skoro nikoho. Byla jsem i v Japonské zahradě, co mě zde mrzelo bylo to, že jsem se těšila, že nafotím spoustu fotek, ale bohužel jezírka byla vypuštěná a zeleň nebyla příliš upravená, nikde ani noha. Celkově to na mě působilo příliš ztísněně. Zbytek parku taky nic moc.< /text>
