<Text>We've been ordering food from Basil Thai Bistro for several years. Love the Spicy Fried Rice. Staff is always polite and accommodating. We'd never received an incorrect order until the other night and didn't realize the mistake until we arrived home. We called the restaurant and they immediately offered to deliver us the correct order at no charge. Delicious food and excellent customer service!< /Text><Time>1604428526639< /Time><Rate>5< /Rate><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< name>

<Review>We went there for lunch in a small group last week. The food was nice. Seemed to be fairly authentic. Good choice on the menu. Though the menu not mention about Vegan dishes but no big deal. After asked the waiter, They have a lot of choice for Vegan dishes. Unfortunately, Their curries couldnt do. He was reasonably attentive.
Everyone in our group seemed satisfied with their meals. Easy parking in front of the restaurant.<//Review>< pics>

Every area has a BEST Thai food place. After trying dozens of Thai restaurants around East County and even central SD, this place is my favorite. Friendly staff and quick service as well. My go to spot for picking up lunch to take back to work.</review>

Most of the food is passable, but today I ordered the Mango Sticky Rice for my Thai wife and it was abysmal.  Three big problems with one dish: 1.  The mango was unripe and sour.  2.  The rice for this dish should be cooked with the coconut milk.  They just cooked like you do for a savory dish, then poured coconut milk on top.  3.  The serving size for $6.40 cost was minuscule.  You can tell they are used to serving food to people who don’t know what it should taste like.</text>

Whatever sauce they use for the PadThai and Spicy Noodles - it’s delicious! Not too salty and the noodles are never over/under cooked. The food comes out fast and fresh. I recommend getting their sampler platter so you can try all kinds of appetizers they have. Also their sweet rice with mango is my favorite!!!

We throughly enjoyed all the food served on the night, also the gluten free meals. The entrees of , chicken satay, spring rolls were all heat hot and tasty. Cashew Nut and Pad Thai were all a good size serving and very tasty. Not being a lover of rice I couldn’t stop eating the chicken fried rice, not sure what was in it but it was yummy. Friendly staff, very attentive. Recommend this restaurant and would definately return.</review>

I highly recommend you get the chicken salad and for your entree you can choose vegetarian, chicken, beef, pork, seafood Etc and the prices are excellent such a great value.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Review>This is a good average Thai place. There's more intimate seating in booths and tables. It's pretty nice inside, modern décor, decorated. Staff is okay and is accommodating. Take out time was acceptable, even though it wasn't busy at all.

I ordered the pad thai with tofu. The noodles were soft,  and came with egg, green onion, bean sprouts, peanuts. The flavor was just okay, it was pretty oily, but also lacked a little tartness that it would usually have.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

While I love their food and the cozy atmosphere, I wish they would be open during the middle if the afternoon when I get off work. Sometimes, I can't wait for them and have to find another Thai restaurant.< /Text>

<Text>No. NO!

They prominently advertise their vegetarian and vegan offerings...yet a phone call placed to management reveals there is fish stock and chicken broth in EVERYTHING, even those things marked vegan! What the...?!

I'm sorry, please remind me what kind of plants chickens and fish grow on?

This is unacceptable, and their "oh well" attitude about it, once confronted, is unconscionable.

They are dosing unwitting vegetarians and vegans with the very ingedients they are dining there to avoid. That's just laziness at best, and outright sinister at worst.

VEGANS AND VEGETARIANS, BOYCOTT THIS PLACE!!!

There are plenty of other options where you won't be exposed to animal ingedients, and where the integrity of your choices and commitment is properly respected.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

First let me state that the food is okay. However, their pricing is ridiculous. We ordered spicy noodles with 1/2 shrimp and 1/2 chicken. The cost of the spicy noodles with just shrimp is $12.95. We paid $14.95 (since we added chicken) and there were 2 shrimp in the entire dish along with some grossly overcooked chicken. I also ordered panaang curry with 1/2 tofu and 1/2 vegetables. I think there were 4 pieces of tofu. If you stick to the menu with one item you will probably be okay. For me....I won't be back.</Text>

Food is great and inside of place is elegant. However, it is semi expensive for portion size. I ended up spending 50$ for two plates and some appetizers.<//Text>

I have liked everything Ive had on the menu.  Ive only had vegetarian items, so my experience is limited.  I am pretty picky when it comes to Thai food, and this place does not disappoint.  If you are not made happy by good thai food, then you should probably eat somewhere else.<//Review>

<review>The Food was great ordered chicken pad thai and chicken tom kha with the tofu fresh rolls everything was really good, service was excellent. My only problem was the spice level. I ordered an 8 and it seemed like a 3-4 got home and had to add a good amount of sriracha to spice it up, I will try the 10 next time and update my review.<//review>< name>

I walk into Vision Express to have my eyes checked because they were sore. I didn't have an appointment but they took me right in. I only waited for 5 minutes. The doctor checked my eyes and told me that I had eye allergies. She gave me a prescription and I was on my way. The service was WONDERFUL. You guys have a GREAT STAFF. If I know someone need glasses or just have there eyes checked I would send them there.<//Text>

I love this place! I’m glad they stayed opened during pandemic. Even though we didn’t get exam I was able to take my son in to fill prescription for his glasses. The lady who helped me was very knowledgeable with the lens options. Thank you!</text>

I went to take my daughter for her eye exam  and just because I was 5 minutes late, they told me to reschedule because the doctor had already left anyway !! I told them my daughter was in her virtual class meeting and that was the reason why we came a few minutes late! Before the pandemic I would take my daughter to her appointments here on time and I was not seen on time so I don’t understand the difference! I left and told them this was my first time coming late and they just told me to reschedule. Never again am I coming here. This shows how much they care for there patients.</Review>

All the women in this office were so friendly and helpful. I'm so glad I finally gave in and made the appointment. One of the staff working on my next set of glasses went beyond. I mentioned my old glasses fall off my face and she offered and fix them. The fit is so much better. I believe her name was Nancy, I hope I remember that right. Amazing Staff!!!< /text>

<review>My son had a appointment and I arrived 15 minutes late because he was on his class meeting so when I get there they wouldn’t take him. GREAT way to greet a NEW patient! I am a patient there also but after this I will take my wallet somewhere else and let my family and friends know about my experience.<//review><Resp>None<//Resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_id>101279393605409150318<//user_id>< Name>

I just wanna thank Nancy for making my experience fast easy and her knowledge of products made me feel very at ease on making my decision on choosing my lens and frames for my new pair of glasses , also I’d like to thank Raquel for answering a couple questions I had with the frame sizes she was very nice and easy to approach I am very happy with the overall experience I had here at  vision express next time I go I’m bringing them both Starbucks drinks ! They were awesome!!!!</review>

<Review>Ladies are always professional and very friendly. The Drs are also professional and great at answering any questions you may have. Great prices on the frames they have. If they don’t have the ones you want on display they can order then for you.
Always a great experience with Vision Express Optometry.<//Review>< Pics>

Vision Express has always done an exceptional job at what they do.
They have great customer service, have always made me feel comfortable, and allow me to take my time when choosing frames without having to feel pressured to rush and checkout. Raquel has always been my go to, she models professionalism and comfort all in one.< /Text>

<text>I'm a veteran of the US Army. I am fortunate to be medically covered by the VA. The VA was going to send me to an outside eye doctor that VA contracts with. This was so I would be seen sooner than the VA could get me in. I waited and was called by Vision Express Optometry. We agree on an appointment date and time. Before hanging up, the receptionist told me that there would be a $25 co-pay. I told the receptionist that I would get back to her. The VA said that they are NOT supposed to charge anything. I cancelled the appointment. I'll wait for the VA. I do not like to be taken advantage of. This was my experience. VE keeps calling me back bothering me.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

My experience was amazing. Went in for an exam (haven't gone to get a check up in 2 years). Waited for about 20 mins before being seen. Could have been the time of day. Staff welcomed me and handed my paperwork and did the exam. I appreciate that they were able to explain the process. When I was being seen by the doctor, she was very thorough on what she was looking and finding with my eyes. Placed an order for my glasses with such ease. They did advise me that my glasses would be in 2 weeks and they would give me a call when they are ready for pick up. Got the call and they fitted my glasses and they are perfect! Now, I need some sunglasses. Great service and very knowledgeable in their field.</review>

So glad I came here! I’ve worn glasses for years now and never been talked about transitions and Blue blocker. It’s the best thing I’ve added to my glasses. The optician who helped me was very knowledgeable and helpful with choosing my frame. By the way they carry a lot of brands. Definitely coming back! Thank you girls !</Text>

<Response>None<//Response><review>Vision express optometry was my first appointment at a vision office in a while. I had never been to a office that had so much selection for frames. Thankfully Christina had a good eye for fashion, and got me up to style with my frames. She was very professional and helpful. THE DOCTOR WAS QUICK AND DID A VERY GOOD JOB ON TESTING MY VISION. I am pretty happy with my decision on coming here. Also i cant wait to get my glasses in a week or so. I highly reccomend this place because of how nice the staff are and how fast and simple it is to go here!<//review><Date>1519325715139<//Date><user_name>kristine moya</user_name>< Pictures>

My sister was picking up my mom's New glasses she sat there for more than two hours. She signed in and sat there waiting. After waiting and seen every one that got there after her walked back to the window and asked when she was going to be seen. The young lady was very rude asked her to sign in and wait. My sister told her she I all ready did two hours ago.
The young lady got my mother's glasses and gave it to here with out at less a I apologies for the wait. She just said here they are. But still very rudely.<//Review>

This was the first time my son had an eye exam and our experience was AWESOME! Dr. Khaniya is the best.  Love the T.V in the waiting area it catches children eyes and keep them busy while they wait.  All the office staff is friendly and very helpful.  We will definitely come back.</Review>

Looks good but after I had my glasses or 2 months the film  started to fall if and couldn't see out of my glasses lucky for me the have 1 year warranty... Do no worries right?!? WRONG same thing happened with the new pair. I make sure I clean my glasses properly and put them away carefully. So I now need to buy new glasses again!< /text>

The location was really good because one can do other things while in that area, like do grocery shopping at Cardenas, or go to Pep Boys for little  things for the car, or check out the Verizon store .

The office space is well-designed with private areas for checking in for appointments and airing your concerns to the customer representative; the waiting area has good seating capacity with soft comfortable chairs and  a view to a wide screen TV; there was also quite  a good selection of frames to choose from.

The examination rooms were secured and private and had the up-to-date vision-testing paraphernalia.

I was really impressed with the Optometrist, Dr. Shin. He exuded confidence that he knew exactly what he was doing and he was calm and very professional yet friendly as he explained the condition of my eyes and the course of action I need to take to preserve them or to prevent further damage to my beginning cataract. I would definitely recommend him to my family and friends. He did not rush and he answered  all my questions kindly and with efficiency.
On the medical side of this clinic, I would give it a "10"

BUT on the sales side- I found a great disparity between the "special $99.00 deal of the day" and the "custom eyeglasses" which are costly.
It is not only the physical location of the frames that relegated them to having red tags, but the attitude that the sales personnel exhibited as I was transferred to view these cheaper alternatives. I feel that it is a fantastic thing for the Clinic to offer these bargains and I would have felt privileged to have purchased from that stock. I really just wanted a spare glasses,  My experience in choosing between what  I wanted but did not want to afford and the $99 specials could have been more satisfying if the person serving my needs had given that cheaper choice the same importance as the more expensive ones.  As it was, I felt that I should just go somewhere else to get my glasses; a place where there can be mutual satisfaction in whatever package I choose to purchase. I hope that this review will be taken in the spirit it was given. Vision Express Optometry has so much going for them already, this " glitch", I'm sure, can easily be "tweaked" :) Good luck !</review>

Very unhelpful, I got my prescription a couple months ago and the doctor said I had stigmatism, she said i can chose my prescription with or without it, went today to print  my perscription without stigmatism instead and the ladies said I would have to take another eye exam (which is $90) just so they can change it.< /Text>

<Review>WORST OF THE WORST!!!! don't go there, I went a month ago and unfortunately I paid in full for the glasses HUGE MISTAKE!!! so far nothing, I called 3 or 4 times already in 2 days and they told me that they'll call me back LOL, so far NOTHING! today I called back AGAIN and requested my money back and now they need to wait AGAIN! until they can talk to the lab, and to add more pain to the injury, they won't reimburse the doctor visit, they'll just return the money for the glasses only if they are able to talk to the lab and call me back later today. Anyway, DON'T GO THERE!!!!!!!!!!< /Review>< pics>

<text>Modern Resale is without doubt a great place to discover an incredibly well curated selection of modern and unique furniture and objects at a fraction of their original cost. I’ve come back to the site time and time again and am always impressed at their offerings. The staff is super friendly, communicative and accommodating and have made my past transactions an enjoyable experience. Always on the lookout for interesting furniture and objects? Modern Resale must be among your go-to sites.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

There's no better place to get gently used, high quality, vetted, and haute-design furniture and lighting than Modern Resale. Their website is easy to navigate. Their sales team is quick to respond to any questions and Sarah & Stacia do an excellent job vetting the furniture that is accepted to their inventory. We'll be using them any time we need items that are 'In Stock'.</review>

Modern Resale stocks some incredible European furniture brands. Pricing is very competitive and all items are in stock so there’s no waiting around. Would highly recommend and will most certainly purchase there again.<//text>

Modern Resale is always my first (and usually only) stop for furniture.  I've been shopping there for about 7 years and they constantly have new amazing inventory.  Furniture is high-end and in great condition, so we pay half the price for an item that seems new.  Their selection is so well curated.  I even have bought 2 pieces of art there - my favorite pieces.  The owners are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable.  They're a pleasure to work with and have always given me great advice on what will and won't work.  I can't say enough positive things about Modern Resale!!</review>

I have bought many pieces over the years from Modern Resale -- sofas, bed, chairs -- based on their website.  They shipped them to NYC and SF and everything was handled professionally.  Their pieces are top notch and the owners really care about the customers.  I had the pleasure of visiting their showroom finally in 2020 and it was lovely.  I cannot recommend them high enough for anyone who cares about great design, even if you are not in LA.< /text>

I've purchased 4 items to date with Modern Resale. They have some of the most sought after furniture pieces on the market and at prices much more affordable than other consignment stores or private sellers. With their extensive knowledge, the team at Modern Resale is also helpful with providing design recommendations when trying to find the right piece for your home. You know you're in the right place when you hear the team speak with a strong level of passion about each piece. I look forward to selling some of my pieces with them in the future.<//Review>

Wonderful! I found a beautiful B&B Italia bed at Modern Resale but living on the other side of the country made delivery tricky. Sarah and her team made it happen! Sarah didn’t stop until she found a transport service to deliver the bed. The bed arrived in perfect condition as described! We absolutely love it and highly recommend Modern Resale!<//text>

<text>As the owner of a luxury airbnb as well as a design lover, I can't imagine living without Modern Resale.  Sarah and Stacia, the owners, are the most amazing curators: I have never purchased anything that looks less than brand new, and I always walk away with some magical find that makes me feel like the luckiest person on the planet. Modern Resale has put designers I could only dream of owning within reach and they are always the first place I look!< /text>< date>

We were thrilled to find Modern Resale and were so pleased with their ability to market our chaise lounge that was beautiful but no longer working for us.   We never would have been able to sell this piece on our own for the price we got.  What a great resource!</review>

<text>I’ve had the recent pleasure of coming across this wonderful oasis of contemporary design. As an architect and design junkie it was a pure joy to ring the bell and stumble upon a place with such a wide range of meaningful design. The business model is terrific and sustainable..many times people buy and collect significant icons of design and need a way to fit new things into their collections. Those “older” pieces hold value to another generation. The beauty is that these are readily available and have been curated by the team at Modern Resale. The staff is acutely knowledgeable in all things design. If you are looking to find high-design objects and furniture at an accessible price there is no better place I could recommend in town.</text>< pics>

Julian and Desiree are amazing. Super cool stuff, great eye for this design period, and incredible service. They both care about what goes in your home. The restoration is also an added bonus - the pieces always turn out beautifully. A staple whenever we're in search of good inspiration, a new piece, or just a fun afternoon.<//Review>

She answers the phone and shares her knowledge to guide you through your considered purchases. She makes suggestions based from really listening to your needs which is so refreshing.She went above and beyond to get the purchased goods to our remote location in Montana. The shipping costs were fair, she made our delivery window and the goods arrived early. Early, yes, can you believe it? During Covid? Stacia literally texted me the hour time frame the delivery would arrive. When they guys arrived, they apologized for arriving at the bottom of the hour. As they took the goods out of the truck, they handled the goods carefully. Carrying the goods into the house, the guys were mindful of the house as they placed and assembled the pieces. The entire experience was a joy all around. For sure, I will purchase more items from Modern Resale. Stacia is also the kind of business person I enjoy doing business with.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1598032924935, 'text': 'Thank you so much Holly!

I was able to purchase very high-end stuff for 35% of what it costs retail. I thought I knew what high-end meant—I.e. the brands you see in Design Within Reach, but the brands Modern Resale carries are truly on another level, out of reach but all but the top .5%.

I love the table. My father was an aerospace engineer and he would approve too. The table came as described — a bit scratched on the legs and discolored on top but no problem for me. Kiesha made the delivery arrangements so everything happened promptly and flowed smoothly from beginning to end. I recommend M R for buyers who are looking for great value and service from classic used furniture.</Text>

Modern Resale has the very best selection of contemporary luxury resale furniture.

Stacia has an incredible eye for beauty and placement, and I'm always inspired by her suggestions.

So many amazing designer furniture pieces and brands like B&B Italia, Ligne, Cassina, Cappllini, and Minotti. They’re like new for far less than you’d  find at shops on Beverly and Robertson, or even Design Within Reach. Just picked up an amazing new Saarinen marble table - huge score!< /Review>

The inventory of gently used high design furniture is usually in near perfect condition and at a better than new price.  The staff is knowledgable. But you do have to keep watching the website as things only come available when someone doesn't want them anymore.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I sold 15 items with Modern Resale in 2016 … B&B Italia, Maxalto, Armani Casa etc.  I met with a Modern Resale representative and we agreed on pricing and then they scheduled movers to transport the items to their showroom.  Over the next several months the items periodically sold and I would receive documentation of the sale and a check.  Their level of expertise and professionalism surpassed my greatest expectations.  Modern Resale is the “go-to” place for the sale of designer furniture.

A proper burger joint.  Inside and outside ordering and seating. Great burger selection, shakes like I used to get back in the days, and kid approved. Plus they were very attentive to my child's food allergy</text>

<Review>My husband just drove by and saw a big truck and people working there. I think he means they're doing some renovation, not cooking burgers, lol. I just saw two signs last week that read "under new management" and "coming soon." We're going to try to stop by there soon to see if/when they're reopening and whether or not they'll be offering a similar or same menu. If we do, I'll update my post. If anyone else stops by soon, please share your findings with us. Thanks!<//Review>< pictures>

Great selection, fun location and good service. Char on the burgers is delicious! They offer wraps for low-carb/keto, fries hand cut and make for some soft and some crispy. Soda fountain has the basics. Solid tables outside with umbrellas, bathroom is a little small but totally functional... Which is necessary because the burgers are loaded and get a little messy! Love the fun burger names, named after HD motorcycles! There are some tables and a small bar inside for seating, smells amazing in there and you can watch the chef at work.

Totally recommend! Delicious!< /review>

Had a great experience with Ethan at this store. The first time we went he was super helpful and really helped us understand what would work best for us. When we were ready to buy we went back to him and he again was fabulous. The prices were great too. Turns out we weren’t able to get the mattress shipped to the central coast where we needed it but still definitely wanted to give a public shout out to Ethan and thank him for his patience and for trying to work with us. I believe Ethan is now at the Morgan hill store. Thanks again! We would highly recommend!< /review>

The sales rep that attended us (Alexis) was very knowledgeable and answered all of our questions. We really appreciated his kindness and patience. He made sure that we were comfortable with every choice we made, down to the pillows and sheets. He went above and beyond for us and was generous in giving us a great deal.< /review>

The clerk was very knowledgeable about the products + helped me find something similar at a great price. They have access to products at other locations, so they aren’t just limited to their inventory. He was able to quickly hunt down what I wanted.I decided to finance which was easy + quick. Delivered 2 days later. They were on time + professional. Took the old bed. And I love the bed. Would not buy a bed anywhere else.</Review>< Pics>

I got excellent assistance and advice from a young man named Ethan. I was there to find a mattress for my elderly mom that would be compatible with a hospital bed she sleeps in. She has severe osteoarthritis in her back and cannot lay flat so the mattress had to be just the right firmness and we wanted a pillow top for softness. I was able to bring my mother into the store to try them out. Ethan was extremely helpful and gentle with my mom. I’m so grateful.</Review>

I'm often defensive by sales people, but she didn't use any hard sell tactics. She simply listened and guided us to the products that fit our needs. In times where sales people don't know their products and just want to upsell, our experience was a breathe of fresh air. Buying a mattress is not something you want to regret. Mattress Firm Gilroy and Shaya made sure we walked away feeling great about our big purchase.<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>From the start, Gabe lead the sale with not only his product knowledge, but showcased why the information he provided,  was  an important consideration towards our buying choice. He was patient and answered all of  our questions and was dialed into our experience and did not push the sale. For me,  this type of behavior and salesmanship speak volumes.

Please do yourself a favor and go in to see Gabe for all of your mattress needs. His honest and professional guidance will leave you feeling more excited about purchasing a mattress. For those who work above Gabe, I hope you see the true value employee you have here. After all, it is not easy to sell someone a 2,000 dollar plus mattress while being able to maintain the customer experience and service.  Thanks again Gabe! Cannot wait to receive our delivery. (Hint hint: we got an amazing deal plus next day delivery!!!)<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

We had a very knowledgeable visit to the store in Gilroy.   We also walked out knowing that in a week we will be sleeping on a mattress suited for our sleep style.   Gabe Ramirez went above and beyond our expectations.   Gabe made sure we knew what styles of mattresses they had to offer and allowed us to decide without pressure what we liked.    Thank you Gabe and Gilroy Mattress Firm for a pressure free, relaxing, friendly buying experience.<//Review>

Alvin was a very helpful resource at Mattress Firm. I was able to safely try out several different models of mattresses to address my personal needs. I’m looking forward to receiving the mattress and utilizing it.< /review>

We purchased the Purple Mattress from our salesman Gabe Ramirez and it was a fantasy experience. Gabe was not pushy at all and gave us plenty of time to try different mattresses out. Gabe was very knowledgeable about the various brands and answered all of our questions with ease. We had ordered a king size mattress which unfortunately was too large for the space where it needed to go but Steven, the Store Manager, graciously agreed to exchange the king size for a queen size.  There was a bit of a challenge on the day that our queen size mattress was delivered but Steven took care of it like a true professional! I highly recommend the Gilroy Mattress Firm store if you are looking for awesome service and a company that honors their return policy. We are very grateful to Mattress Firm for making us very happy customers! By the way.....the Purple Mattress is incredible and we love it!!</text>

Easiest bed purchase. Called in to the store, told Gabe an idea of what I wanted for my daughter and he had everything figured out in just a few minutes. Probably took ten minutes total. Thanks Gabe. My daughter is excited for her big girl bed!</text>

<Text>My only reason for not leaving a 5 star is that I called my local mattress firm in Salinas, when I was able to get a hold of someone it was to the Gilroy location. Needing a bed I made the trip to Gilroy. Making the trip was a blessing in disguise,  the mattresses were on sale,  friendly staff, and I got a great deal.< /Text>< pictures>

Thank you so much Steven for your wonderful help! You asked all of the right questions and led us to our perfect mattress. It was the best sales experience we’ve had from start to finish. We had no idea what type of mattress that we wanted or what we should be looking at. Steven was the least pushy salesman and so knowledgeable about all of the mattresses- it made for a very enjoyable sales experience. We even had enjoyable conversation the manager and other sales people. Thank you for saving our backs!!!< /Text>

We were nervous about walking into another mattress store after having a bad experience at another local store but Gabe instantly made us feel comfortable.  He had a super easy process that narrowed down our options to one we both loved. He also explained their interest free financing and helped us get to a payment we were comfortable with.  If you are in Gilroy and need a new mattress go see Gabe at Mattress Firm!<//text>< pictures>

I have been very cautious during this pandemic but finally after15 years of my temperpedic it was time for a new bed. After reading reviews I determined I would venture out of town and go to mattress firm in Gilroy.
I made an appt and arrived as the Mgr Gabe was opening up precisely at 10. The store was spotless and I found the bed I was interested in (purple hybrid with adjustable base). My financing was arranged promptly and my delivery date is open as I will be moving soon.
I couldn't have had a better experience. Great deal and GREAT service
Thanks Gabe!

Well I moved and the men came right on time and installed my beautiful Purple hybrid 3 in just a few minutes. Very clean and safety aware. I didn't get to sleep on it for 2 days as still moving. As I was making the bed I realized it was quite high and I had asked Gabe for the short legs so I called him and he actually took time out of his day to come from Gilroy to Hollister and adjusted the legs all the way down. I am sitting on it now, ready to call it a day but I stopped to write this review because if you want a GREAT BED AND AWESOME SERVICE you shouldn't waste your time shopping around because Mattress Firm is the only place to go
THANKS GABE, you're THE BEST MANAGER I've dealt with in years. Keep up the good work!< /Text>

Marcie was not too pressuring as normal sales reps are and when I returned with my counterpart to check out the mattresses, Neil assisted.

Had a great experience with Gabe and the team!  They were awesome helping me out when a mattress ended up being a little too soft for my son due to a back injury.  They took care of my son and I and I couldn't be happier.  I will never shop for a mattress anywhere else.  Thanks Gabe!<//Review>

<Review>The staff was not only friendly, but extremely patient while my husband and I were indecisive. They took the time to walk us through all our options while educating us and pinpointing our needs - helping us to stay within our budget.< /Review>< response>

<review>Purchased a Beauty Rest mattress from Mattress Firm about 2yrs ago. Thought our mattress was to soft due to my on going lower back pain and my wife's hip pain. Went back to Mattress Firm to consider a different mattress. Remember my expensive Beauty Rest was only 2 yrs old. The district sales manager (who happened to be in the store that day), and the sales associate, understood my situation and went above and beyond to accommodate purchasing a new mattress.<//review>< username>

<username>Marlene Corpus< /username><time>1443643100456</time><Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Horrible delivery service and unprofessional drivers that damaged my very expensive furniture weeks ago and NOTHING is being done about it to this day!

I've spoken to 3 people and reported the damages, the drivers took photos, I took photos and still NOTHING is being done to replace my damaged furniture.

Now I'm the line and have been for 15 minutes with a warranty specialist that's told me they don't handle claims outside of mattresses. I tried to explain the run-around I've been getting and all he could do is talk over me. I asked to speak with a Sup and he continued to talk over me until he said what he wanted to and then transferred the call. I'm still on hold now!

Will update with the results of yet another call!<//Review>< pictures>

It's simple:
They answered phone, gave competitive price, set appointment on same day, told us it would take 30 mins, they were done in 30 mins, they smiled at arrival, they were pleasant and generally happy.

Highly recommend.
Many Thanks.< /Text>

<review>Quickest emissions test I’ve ever had. I guess I got lucky there was no one there when I showed up. This is a no frills smog shop, but Bob was on point, friendly and professional. He got me on way quickly. Cash or debit here only. Thanks Again Bob.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dc7032935e665f:0x236a06bd924ee707</gmapID></record>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Open longer hours, and on the weekend. Called ahead to set up appointment and drove right up. To get smog done on my car. Friendly service, easy to find in the corner of the building by Amadors repair shop you follow the directions the employees. Google has a few glitches on directions, hopefully I fixed that with the location icon.</Text>< pictures>

I had taken my BMW to another shop to get smogged (closer to my work) and they failed it. I knew my car and I just wasn't buying it, so I took it to my regular shop, Bob at ABC Smog. He immediately knew that the other shop was using an wrong or out-of-date reference and did not know my car (rare model). Bob promptly ran the test and it passed. Not to mention he was actually cheaper too! I learned my lesson and I will ALWAYS see Bob first!< /Text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>Not what I expected as it is an undecorated room that was likely originally built to host an business office. Payment is made up front before entering the eating area. However, the food was good. If is served buffet style and is all you can eat Indian vegetarian food. Judging by the clientele, it is a favorite with the local Indian population.</Text>< pics>

This is a very good sattvic food place near great america Pkwy. Very hygienic healthy food. It's unlimited (buffet). They usually have 1-2 rice item , sambhar/dal , one dry sabji like aloo Gobi, and chapati. They also have some dessert like sooji halwa or fruit cream from time to time.
They have a meal pass option which can get you one meal free (with 5 meals ).< /Text>

The food was good, but overall there are many other options that I'd prefer for Indian vegetarian food.<//Review>< Date>

The atmosphere is odd because it's in a office building turned Krishna Temple. But im an odd one and enjoy the tunes.

They didn't try to sell me books or anything.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808fc9d4ebdddf0d:0xa97d672f06ff3e8d</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5</rating><Review>It is an excellent place for eating sanctified sattvic vegetarian food, at an economic price. Featuring a full course lunch buffet with a salad bar, the higher taste certainly lives upto its name. Though the quality/taste might have dropped compared the beginning, it is certainly great compared to the other options available in the area. It’s a must have place for vegetarians.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

< review>
This is the best place to have lunch buffet around sunnyvale/sanjose/fremont areas only for $4.99(inagural offer) with Satwik food -Plenty of items U cant imagine those many items for such a low price. Great ambions -great place- motive is to serve best food for best price#non commercial organization.
Highly recommended#

They have been constantly increasing their lunch buffet menu from ~$4 to ~$7 to ~$9 within an year. The food is bland kinds but pretty decent, but the ridiculous increases in price is a turn off given that it is not mainstream  indian food in terms of taste.< /text>

Great service if they would change their grading scale. Excellent Is scuffed screen with scratches or ever blurry camera lens.  Like new is like new, Excellent + is sightly better than Excellent and Excellent ++ or +++ is minimal scratches and such.< /Review>

Never again. I bought from them , and every time phones arrives not in the promised condition... don't forget that you have to pay for the shipment back.... when you call them out on the quality, they disable your account...Don't waste  your time, money or store reputation.</review>

<text>Have had bunch of bad experiences here. They resell salvaged phones that have previously have had some problem and purchase back stolen items and when you want to return it they will mark it down in your account as your fault. It’s unfortunate we have people like them in our community doing bad business.

Just a warning. They will cancel your account if you check them for their own mistakes. Unethical business and wouldn’t recommend anyone to these people< /text><Rate>1</Rate>< name>

If you tell them about it, they will rudely dismiss you and ban your account. Bad business practice here.< /review>< pics>

Scored a few good deals here. Service could be better but the deals are worth it.

Update: Was here here again 8/2019 for another phone. Condition was NOT as described on their site. I pointed out the flaws and they said if I didn't like give it back, which is what I did. Complete waste of time!< /text>

great place to get a used phone.  I was following a phone online and every day one's not sold the price goes down.  I waited until the last moment and bought it.  I picked it up at the store and they went over any of the special notes posted on the site.  This particular phone had a note about screen discoloration on the left edge.  I bought it anyway and you can barely see any problem.  The phone is in great shape.<//text>

<text>Them people that work at this company can't take criticism when they messed up your order.  They will just deactivated your account to avoid dealing with you in the future. Very childish behavior! Just hope they never mess an order.. Stay away! !< /text>< pics>

Good drink specials,  delicious made to order food, a little on the spendy side for bar grub, but that might just be my lack of comfort with San Francisco pricing 🤣.  I loved the wall of pictures in the back room dance floor (wink) and the wallpaper is really delightful... you'll just have to visit to know what I'm talking about!
Relaxed, fun atmosphere.. even on an early Friday night it was still busy enough to feel anonymous if that's your thing, but enough room to move and dance. I'll definitely come back the next time I'm in town.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>This was my first time being able to celebrate Pride (and in San Francisco no less!). Jolene’s was full of wonderful LGBT folks from all over the Bay Area the night after the parade- but we know the real Pride starts when we can all share the same intimate space. The music and atmosphere was static.

Jolene’s is a place where you can revel in the joy, the resilience, the protest, and the camaraderie that the San Francisco lgbt+ community has to offer.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOi9UZFExZ8716ynJMLLgLhM4-oW9zMCET05NTO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

10$ dollar entrance fee regardless of what event is going on. Takes forever to get served at the bar. The drinks are expensive and come in really small plastic cups that are filled with ice. The dance floor has no ventilation and feels like you are in a sweat steam room. The music always leaves something to be desired. In addition, the vibe is always very strange and hostile. I have been several times and I regret ever spending any time or money there.</text>

Usually get some Mac and cheese balls and fries to go along with rotating, inventive cocktails. Awesome dance floor which is usually empty when I go on weekday evenings. Good for you and a partner, a solo work session, or a medium-sized group (plenty of season).</Text>< user_name>

Not a safe place. Not inclusive. Was hoping for a good lgbt community and female power but was disappointed when I felt out of place, ignored when being served, and rude management. Would not go here again.<//Text>

<review>The vibe on a Friday night is fun.  Food is surprisingly yummy, but prices for food & drink tend on the higher end.  Go-go dancers, good DJ jams, good lighting, pool table, and a safe & fun atmosphere lead to good times.  I have not experienced brunch, but I have yet to have a negative experience here.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Highly recommend this girl bar/club when visiting San Francisco.  Not much action for the ladies near the Castro. Jolenes was needed in the area. They also serve delicious food.  Win.<//Text>

< review>
This new bar is so well thought out! They have water pitchers (so You don’t have to ask at the bar and can stay hydrated), plenty of seating in the spacious main room, gogo dancers, great bar food, pool tables, coat check and an intimate room for dancing within eyeshot of the DJ. Such a good club! Honestly, think it’s the best new gay bar in the city!< /review>

Not really my scene but the music was fun, definitely not mainstream. The dancefloors are pretty small, so it gets very hot. The food was definitely a plus!</review>

<Text>The space needs lots of ventilation although they were no crowd at all but it was really really hot in there and we couldn't handle it so we had to leave.
The music is good though.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>Jolene Linsangan is a notorious TERF and this bar by extension is a haven for TERF's! Do not patron! There are FAR better alternatives for the lesbian community.

Transgender women, especially ones of color, are NOT welcome, at best they are tolerated. Should they "step out line" by having the temerity to approach a CIS woman they are instantly expelled!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

< review>
Sunday was my friends Birthday. She had called and messaged ahead of time to see how to reserve tables for all in her party. There was a planned 30 ppl from south bay suppose to show up to celebrate. She was told its 1st come 1st serve basis. So we showed up right when doors opened walked in and saw 3 tables with "reserved" signs on  them. We asked the bartender how we could get tables or even reserve them. We told her what we were told. Her reply is "I literally have no idea. That comes from the owner".  We thought that was weird but settled for bar sitting even though we knew it wasn't going to be enough space for us all. As time went on now 3hrs into the show  I wanted to try some of my friends mimosa. So I poured 2 oz in my 4 oz water cup. With quickness the male bartender jumped down my throat. Going off on me about how I didn't pay for the mimosa. And I told him no my friend did I just wanted to try it. He continued to tell me I couldn't bc I didn't pay for it. I said so is "sharing is not caring here" he said "No sharing is not caring here" he told me that I might as well drink it now being that I poured it. I told him nm he turned me off to it and I didn't want it anymore. From that point on I didn't order anything anymore.

Look ppl I get if it's their policy you can't share bottomless mimosas but don't talk ppl so rudely. Especially if you do not have that posted anywhere not even on your website! Seriously there are different ways to tell a customer what the bar policy is. In all none of us in the party were impressed or really happy about the service here. We will not be back. That's 22 ppl from SJ who will only be speaking about how bad their experience was here.<//review>

It's GREAT to have a womens bar again in SF...and Jolenes bar hits the mark perfectly. Staff is pretty laid back attentive to customers and even serve with a smile! It's so wonderful to see so many different types of women flocking to Jolenes    the want and need was there and Jolenes have made a chill safe CLEAN place for us to go,)</text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Super sweet front desk staff. Very warm and down to earth. The doctor on duty called my doctor personally and both came up with a plan for me. I am so glad I found this place. Waiting outside in our cars is such a good idea, I would hate to be sitting next to someone that came in with something contagious. The app and phone system they have going on is awesome. Will definitely be coming back if I need to in the future.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Very happy with the service. It took longer than normal to be seen however we were able to wait in the car until called. The PA was thorough and very helpful.< /Text>

<Review>We scheduled an appointment online. When we arrived for the appointment we were greeted as soon as we walked through the door. The office was super clean and nice. The wait time was was maybe 10 minutes. The staff- front office, nurse and Dr were extremely friendly and helpful. I will definitely use this office again for any future  urgent care needs.<//Review>< Time>

<Review>The staff were friendly and the doctors were fantastic!  I have been to many clinics around the world, and this one was the cleanest, and most professional.  Both doctors I encountered took extra time to ensure I got the care I needed—even if it was something that an orderly or nurse could do.  The wait is short and the medical care I received was stress-free!  The doctors are very knowledgeable and proactive in treating.  I recommend this place to any/everyone!</Review>< pics>

<Text>Really great nurses and amazing doctor on shift Monday, 7/19 PM. I was there 4 minutes before closing and I HATE being that person to show up right before they lock the doors. They didn’t mind at all, super friendly and didn’t rush me out the door like I feel so many other places do. They all took their time and helped me out immensely. Thank you ALL!< /Text>< pics>

<Text>We used to go to accelerate urgent care cause it's all you heard about our saw Around town.  Well after a couple of terrible visits & misdiagnoses we change to priority urgent care on Allen. They have been great,  never a long wait,  always kind & knowledgeable.  We'll stick with them</Text>< user_name>

Every step of my visit was prompt, check in, received help from receptionists, vitals checked, to Dr. visit.
My medication was called into the pharmacy I go to which made it so much nicer.
Kindness all around , thank you</text>

Took my daughter in cuz she has been having a bad cough and wheezing, dr came in and checked her ears, but that was it, didn’t even listen to lungs or anything I asked him if that was it , and if he was going to check her throat he said no I don’t think she will let me, like if she was giving him trouble he didn’t bother to even try and I’m sure she would of let him… he was so Much in a rush to just to get us out of there, he prescribed amoxicillin for what we don’t know she had, they pretty much give you amoxicillin for everything…smh< /text>

<Review>Excellent experience from scheduling to arrival to care. I was able to go online, pick a location and time (as soon as 10 minutes but opted to give myself time to brush my teeth 😂) When i arrived 10 mins early the lobby had social distancing in place but only one other person was there. i checked in and paid my copay, then waited no more than a few minutes. vitals were done and i was an emotional mess about my injury. the MA was super kind and excellent bedside manner. I was then taken to the examination room and the DR saw me within minutes. Diagnosed and prescribed a plan, and I was treated, some follow up care questions answered and on my way. by the time i  started headed to my pharmacy i had a notification  the prescription was ready. What an awesome experience pre, during, and post, and I will continue to use them for urgent care.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

My husband and I liked Priority Urgent Care at Allen Rd because they were first of all, Safety Conscious  - Clean and  Very Organized.
Katlin and the others staff were very friendly and professional!
Dr. Chu was very kind, professional, very helpful and inspired confidence!
Definitely will refer this clinic to my acquaintances.
Also wonderful care from Bea, nurse who performed ear flushing procedure in manner that lent dignity to patient!</review>

<Text>With my physicians monitoring, I’d  had a slowly dropping hemoglobin for the last 2 months. When I visited my pcp yesterday they noticed a steeper drop than they thought and asked if I wanted to set up some iron infusions. I declined because my rheumatologist had already been working to set those up for today. When that fell thru my family was very concerned that I’d be going thru the weekend with a more drastic drop than expected. I went to Priority Urgent Care on Allen where I’d one other time visited with a more compelling emergency. They were very well staffed, quick to help me then, so I thought they might be able to run some bloodwork as quickly as possible to ease family’s worry. They understood perfectly. They drew blood and ran it STAT for me. I’m so thankful for them and there professional care.<//Text>< Name>

I had a 1PM appointment just to be told it was going to be over an hour wait. What's the point of having an appointment? Front staff are RUDE as can be. Ended up getting seen finally at 4PM for my 1PM appointment. Avoid this place like the plague.< /text>

Just had a Covid test to clear myself for surgery. Staff excellent! Dr. Had me smiling even though I was so nervous about the test! The nice young man that gave me my swap was patient and explained each step! I will go back if ever I need their service..hopefully not, but nice to have a safe efficient place to return to.</Text>

It was my first time going to an urgent care and I was not disappointed. I was a little nervous at first (I don’t like doctor visits) but the staff was professional and friendly so was the medical assistant who took me in the back. But overall Dr. Kiran Lowen was amazing! She was extremely nice, friendly and very personable, she made me feel comfortable, like if I’ve known her forever. I was in and out in less than 30 minutes but she was very thorough, she answered all my questions. I would definitely recommend Dr. Lowen to anyone, there’s only few doctors like her.< /Review>

This facility is right around the corner from my house and it was recommended to me by another urgent care. I loved the technology that helped me know exactly where I stood as far as waiting in line and to submit all of my personal and insurance data. It was a great experience and the people that actually took care of me were so kind and caring also.</Review>

I pulled my back and the Dr. I felt didn't care about my pain or discomfort.  I would expect a doctor to sympathize with someone who acculally needs help from a junkie off the street.  I'm in school for my BSN and I will work for a doctor that actually listens and helps his patients.</review>

Dr. was informative and came in right away. 4stars because I would have liked a chest X-ray but Allen facility didn’t have it operating. Dr said it was due to worker call ins. If I had known I would have chosen a different facility, but all the healthcare workers at this facility were fantastic. Thoughtful and quick. Their online check in and wait in the car is awesome. I hope that type of precaution sticks around post covid!</review>

This is the 2nd time I have had to use this Urgent Care facility.  I do not like going anywhere except for my primary care doctor.  But this UC is top notch.  My PCP is retiring at the end of this year so I will probably find myself here for non routine doctor visits.  This place is clean and fast, the staff are friendly.  Great Place!!!< /Text>

I just had a Covid test for pre op/surgery. The staff were excellent. The facilities are clean and organized. Everyone was truly professional. I would recommend Priority Urgent Care to anyone needing a Covid Test. I would use them again if necessary.
I called, made an appointment, completed all my paperwork on line via text website. Once at the facility, easy check in, insurance and photo id, then Dr, and the young man explained it may be uncomfortable,  which it was, but he did a great job.</review>

They were dealing with impatient people and the front desk, the person who worked me up and the Nurse Practitioner that saw me were kind and were doing their very best to see everyone in a timely fashion.  I highly recommend this office if you are in need of urgent care.</Review>< pics>

I usually go to Accelerated for Urgent Care visits but decided to try out Priority on Allen Rd because they also offered COVID antibody testing. I'm definitely impressed. From the time I walked in the door I was greeted with smiling eyes and smiling voices. They addressed my concerns quickly and explained the testing involved to solve my ailments. I was especially impressed with Jessie. I'm not a fan of needles like most people are. But Jessie was patient with my anxiety. And he was fast to find my almost nonexistent veins. Very happy with all my visits here so far. I live closer to the Calloway location but will definitely drive to this one for any additional Urgent Care visits I may need in the future.<//review>

I had concerns about the options that were available for my situation and wasn’t sure which way to go. The Provider took the time to explain the differences as well as the pros and cons of each choice to me, without rushing me or making me feel pressured or hurried, until I was comfortable with making a decision. Thank you for the patience and great service! 😁< /review>

<Text>I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was getting checked in and then waiting in my car (due to covid, but prefer that anyway), having access to the wait list, and how quickly I was seen. Everything done via cell phone, and I downloaded the available app for convenience and future visits too.  The staff was courteous, professional, and friendly. The facility was new, clean, and top notch. I saw the doc quickly and he diagnosed and explained necessary treatment. I received medicated injections and had a blood sample taken. They advised they would contact me with lab results and I was given an Rx for pain meds. Left there within an hour of my arrival time. Very happy with my treatment. Will utilize their services in the future for sure!  And they have multiple locations in the valley. Thanks, Priority UC!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Place is very clean. I was a walk in so it took about two hours so wait time is a little slow. No one answers the phones so that is a take away for me because I am hard of hearing and with everyone wearing masks it is hard to understand and hear what they are saying in the front. I called all morning.

The staff in the front was very professional and helpful but not overly friendly. The nurses were very nice and answered all of my questions without any problems or any attitude at all. I would recommend.</Text>

<Review>Very clean and quick service. No BP taken. Dr didn’t check heart or lungs just asked how I felt and took a covid test and ordered zpac for chest congestion and cough. I thought this was a bit vague from the Dr.</Review><Date>1607812012735</Date><UserId.>111108167381892633362</UserId.><gmap_id>0x80ea4581de555e2b:0x393238d3d3897e7e</gmap_id></record>

Set an appt @3pm. Waited in car for one hour. Informed staff I'd be at home to wait cause I wasn't physically able to sit on my car anymore with my 100+ fever. They told us I could wait at home and they would let me through. When I was called at home anotherh our later at 5pm. I drove over (less than 8mins) when I arrived for my appt to finally begin, I was told there was another wait...I'm assuming the room was given away. I waited 2 hours, they couldn't wait 10 minutes...
So another 10-15 mins delay till I was given a room. Then waited till 540pm for a physicians assistant to come inside. I was given 5 minutes or her rushed attn.

Long story short, this is not a private practice so there is no personal attn to your self.
Their system for making appts is not well thought out. And you. Will not be a priority. It's a conveyor belt of ppl going in and out, staggered and slowly.<//text>

While visiting from Florida, my 1 year old son got a bad cough/cold and I brought him to this Urgent Care. Our insurance is not taken outside of Florida so we paid out of pocket, but it actually wasn’t as expensive  as I thought it was going to be. The facility was clean and check-in process was quick and easy. There were a couple people waiting ahead of me, but we were still seen pretty quickly. Dr Loewen was so gentle with my screaming baby and was quick, thorough and very helpful in her diagnosis and treatment plan. She even sent me a coupon for the medicine she prescribed. I was so glad we came here!!<//Text>

I've been to their facility on Allen multiple times and consistently receive top notch care. Extremely short wait times, thorough evaluations, plenty of time with provider to discuss plan, and they take the time to ensure all of your needs are met. The providers are all very sweet and have a wonderful bedside manner. Best Urgent care in Bakersfield - the one all others should strive to be.<//text>

I have always gone to accelerated urgent care in the past. Priority urgent care opened up and this location is right by my house. Needed to have my hand x-rayed to see if I fractured any bones. I went on a Sunday and I was so impressed with the staff. I will no longer be going to any other urgent care facility. Brand new and much larger inside than it looks from the outside. Lobby is nice and everything is brand new .Very impressed and excited that I have an awesome urgent Care so close to home. I highly recommend this facility.<//text>

This priority urgent care location needs to retrain its staff and nurses. They work without any sense of urgency. I've had to call on multiple occasions and have only ever had someone take my call and help me ONCE. Every other time they have put me on a long hold and then hung up on me or just not answered at all. Today I brought my mom to get tested for covid and the service is supposed to be drive up but when I arrived and called as instructed, no one answered! Twice! It went to voicemail. I called the Panama location to see if I could go there they answered after one ring. They tried to connect me and also weren't able to get through so they me to go to the desk to let them know I was there. For a service that is supposed to be drive up. I went inside and there was one person in the waiting room and two women standing behind the reception desk not doing anything. Meanwhile there were over 4 cars waiting outside for someone to go swab them. After every single one of them went inside to let them know they were waiting someone finally came out. She walked outside as if there weren't a line of people waiting. Needless to say, I won't be coming back here.<//review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Such a great experience!  Being under the weather is never fun. Let’s face it we don’t have time to be sick... this for me is especially a tough time of year with travel, business and fundraising. I needed to be seen and didn’t have a lot of time to do it. I was greeted with a smiling face. The wait time was minimal. I was in and out within 30 minutes. Kudos to Priority Urgent Care! They know what they’re doing! Professional and very knowledgeable. The doctor listened to my concerns and made me feel at ease. She prescribed the correct medication to get me on the mend quickly.  Thank you!
The front office staff was prompt and courteous. The office very clean and stylish. My overall experience was a 10!

Thank you Priority Urgent Care! Dr’s Loewen and staff for a great experience.< /Review>< Pictures>

It was a quick and easy trip! I tend to get pretty nervous and flustered when I see doctors but everyone was really nice and helpful, which definitely put me at ease. Would definitely recommend!</Review>

They hurry with getting what you need but don’t hurry when they are in the room with you so understand  what is going on wrong with you.  I felt like they really care how you are doing before they let you leave. Over all I would  Recommend this place to anyone for care plus it’s meat and clean< /Text>< user_name>

<Review>I came in for an ailment and was treated in a timely manner. The staff and Doctor were professional and nice. Also the charges were fair. Other urgent care places have charged three times as much . I recommend Priority Urgent Care on Allen Rd. Hopefully I won’t need emergency services in the future but if I do ,Priority Urgent Care here I come.< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
I have never experienced a better medical visit then my trip to Priority on Allen. I arrived late just an hour before close and was greeted and helped immediately by front reception. I signed in and was shortly taken to a waiting room all levels of interaction with staff was caring welcoming and professional. The MA did an excellent job addressing my symptoms and was very friendly. Dr Lowen went above and beyond to give me the best experience I’ve had in a doctors office. She addressed all my concerns was comforting and made me feel safe and at ease. She was very thorough able to attend to multiple needs simultaneously with a very confident demeanor. I left feeling truly grateful for health care providers like Dr Lowen who obviously takes pride in the great care she gives. I will definitely be recommending this facility to friends and family. Especially the Allen location the office is conveniently located and has been designed in a very clean and functional and most importantly comfortable way. 5/5!!!</Review>

I have been here 3 times since they opened (for me and my kids) and I’m very happy.  Service is always fast, very friendly/personable (even the doctors) and they handle business..< /Review>

We had set up an appointment at 11pm and had to wait over 2 hours! People came after us and were checked in before. Will never be coming here again. The people that run the front desk are very friendly but incompetent.<//Review>
