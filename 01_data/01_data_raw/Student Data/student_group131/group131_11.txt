<Text>Not that visible driving by.  Nevertheless this place is deeelicious. Shrimp were huge and scrumptious served in plastic bag New Orleans style. I had Cajun and the spice was perfect. Manager was uber friendly. Can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu.</Text>< pictures>

I went for the first time. LOVED IT. I'm a foodie and I hadn't even thought about writing a review when I took photos of some of the food we got.The Crab Shack House Mix Sauce is DELICIOUS. EXCELLENT service. Our server's name is Jonathan. He and his assistant (I never got his name) was very nice. I came with a big group. Jonathan double- checked with us to make sure he split our check correctly before running it. Everyone LOVED their food, even the kids. I'm glad I found a little seafood gem. I'm saving up to go again.< /review>

< Review>
We flew in from Longview Tx. Didn’t know anyone down here to help pick out some good eating places. Got on goggle and decided to try out Cajun Crab. The owner very nice. The food was lacking taste big time. Everyone has opinions but for the life of me I question people who says the food is delicious here. I need to find a hole in the wall place that can satisfy my taste buds here in California.< /Review>

<review>This is my fourth visit of this place and am wondering why? The server was cold and indifferent, the waiting time was too long,the fried fish has soft crusts, don't serve coffee and the price is sky high. This visit is definitely my last!< /review>< pics>

Perfect little beach for little ones! No scary waves.  Has some "cliff like" areas perfect for climbing and exploring for the little ones.<//review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Met with a friend for lunch today, and we tried Cajun Crab Shack in Thousand Oaks off of E Avenida De Los Arboles. I have a fondness for Cajun food, particularly for the style I call "Cajun boil" where all of your food is cooked at the same time so everything takes on a really rich depth of flavor. The best part, is it's generally eaten by hand, without utensils. Cajun Crab Shack delivered with delicious, flavorful seafood that was well cooked, seasoned, and reasonably priced. It's location in Thousand Oaks makes it an ideal spot for families looking for a new kind of place for a dinner out, and business types looking for a lunch spot that's a bit of a break from the local sandwich, burger, or salad spot. Though I do recommend you avoid it if you've got important face-to-face meetings immediately after ;). It gets messy, but that's part of the fun. In the end it is tasty, well prepared seafood, at a good price, with friendly service. I highly recommend trying it, and if you like it, recommend it to your friends.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtYBe5WTyIy8ayufjm4THEdCWfyzwvdUF9wEU1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

<text>After coming back from NOLA, was craving some cajun/creole food. Saw this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. What this place needed to amp up the vibe to make the dining experience cooler would be jazz music, just like sitting in NOLA.<//text>< pictures>

HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! There was a wait, but it wasn’t too long. The food, however, was such a disappointment. They gave me cold corn. Like ice cold. It was not edible. Their service wasn’t great and they took forever to bring out the food, or come check up on us.< /Review>

The "lunchbox" special is a great deal--$14.99 --for a huge pan of seafood, sausage, corn cob and potato.  The House Blend spices at medium spicy was relatively mild and delicious.  Fabio, the proprietor, is super friendly and attentive.  Plenty of tables, never a wait to get seated. Great place.< /review>

This is one of the best seafood places I’ve been to in SoCal, and after moving further away from DTLA, I’m glad to have found this place. The gentleman behind the counter has never failed to provide the warmest and friendliest customer service experiences. I haven’t had a thing on the menu so far that I haven’t loved. Please keep doing what you’re doing, because it is all right.< /Text>

DO NOT go to this place bad experience when we opened the bag there was only 7 shrimp when we ordered 2 pounds. The shrimp tasted discusting it was way over cooked we were already an hour away from the restaurant to return it. We spent over $60 for this nasty food. We will never return to this place again.<//text>

The soft crab was extremely small,soggy, and greasy. I order Louisiana style which is corn,sausage, and potatoes in bag. They forgot and brought them separately, in what looked like dish water. After eating and messing up my clothes with sauce, a group of men come in and are seated. The owner/manager, I guess comes to there table and dress them with bibs and looks at me oddly. I figured I'll take the tip and have my shirt dry cleaned. I won't ever be back there. Other foods looked good, but my food was basic, no popping flavors. Not like other crab bag joints. 2 star<//text>

< Review>
We have been there twice and really enjoyed the food. Nice sized portions and reasonable prices. The calamari tasted fresh, but should have been presented as an appetizer as it was a pretty small portion and didn't come with a side. Adding some fries would help. I probably won't order it again at that price point. I like getting clam chowder with my meal, but $9.00 for a pretty small bowl seems too pricey. They should offer a cup at half that price. We loved the crab cakes! Great taste and a nice light breading. We will be back to try more items!<//Review>

<review>An owner that cares, good food, and reasonable prices. What else can you ask for?! Had lunch here today with a friend and I agree with him that you shouldn't wear a white shirt. Expect to get messy. Shrimp was not deveined which would've been nice and the server was eager to empty the carcass bowl. Maybe just replace it with a clean one if that's important to you?

Will come back with friends and colleagues!</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80e8316109b35127:0x31194cd3275f47e4</Gmap_id></record>

< Review>
It was good, I'm a huge sea food lover I would of given this spot 5 stars but I have been here several times and it seem that the food taste different almost every time. Some time the spicy sauce mix is actually spicy but a few times is like someone else makes it that doesn't like spicy cause is beyond mild. And the sauce is what give the pound of shrimps favor so it's kind of important to stay consistent.</Review>

I believe what we had was called the Fisherman's Catch. All sorts of things in a large dish. Got it with their house seasoning. Yep, that's where it was at. Especially with a frosty-cold beer.<//text>

<Text>Food taste good. I think it even more favorable the Boiling Crab. Waiter suggested ordering a bowl of white rice to go with the sauce...Good idea. I love it alot. But of you order king crab, I will suggest you bring a scissor you own. It is much more easier to open the crab shell than the tools they provided. Seating is OK, acceptable. Not cozy enough to me.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Second visit, decided to try again after a mediocre first visit. Both times shrimp in the boil were mushy.  The server remade the order and they were slightly better, but alot of squishy heads and tails. The house sauce is bland and they don't have kids meals.<//Review>

<review>This is the spot, we used to drive far to eat Cajun seafood. Finally it’s here locally. Peel and eat shrimp is amazing, fresh oysters and my husband had the king crab legs, the spices is on the money. One word DELICIOUS.

Ordered a pound of shrimp, and a pound of crawfish... we got less than a pound of either.

Disappointing - the shellfish was very mushy; bummer.

Will be sticking to Boiling Crab.< /text>

Can't say enough great things about our recent dining experience here.  This is the kind of place we have been missing in our town and we strongly recommend all the locals check it out and support its success.  Loved the food, the presentation is relaxed (eat right off the table) and the style of eating makes dinner a fun and novel experience. We will absolutely be return customers!!!</text>

Lauren was a great waitress. However I am giving the restaurant 3 stars for several reasons. Prices are high so I don't like eating with plastic silverware, plastic cups, snd beer in the bottle no beer glass would have been plastic. Everything is fried and they
Wouldn't make my shrimp grilled. I never eat fried food. Yes it was okay, bland but okay. Our ketchup bottle also plastic and the napkins 4 x 4. You need a lot.
Many people like me don't want fried food so they need some fish dishes that aren't. Also the other dinners are priced per pound!!!! Can get very expensive. I had the fried
Shrimp basket and fries period $13.99. No hot drinks like coffee or tea.</text>

Great little find! Pretty good prices, but you have to order by the pound, no 1/2 lb orders.<//Review>

Yikes. Wanted to love this place but the shrimp tasted frozen and was overpriced, considering the quality. Service was really great, which is the only reason for the stars. I would like to try again... But it was pretty bad. Not sure if I will.< /review>

<Review>The food is really good. I especially like the fish and the fries. Eating some dishes could be messy though so perhaps don't wear your best clothes unless you're really careful.<//Review>< Pictures>

I come here all the time to get my car clean. The prices are competitive and definitely justified if thinking about choosing the more expensive options.
The only down side for me is my car always scrape every time I enter.<//Review>

Vacuums have no suction power on 2 of them and 1 has moderate power. Also one took my dollar and didn't turn on so yeah pretty much a bad experience. I will email them about a refund.< /review>

< Review>
Great carwash!   I recently gave this place a try!  Been driving past for years!   Great car wash- great prices- lots of soap but you gotta move fast as time passes quickly!

only issue is sometimes people tend to stay too long drying and vacuming their cars — not  giving others a chance to get a space to do the same.    Wish there were signs stating limit of " 10 minutes per car”.  Also a note saying “do not liter”. I have notice garbage on the ground.   People be nice!

Best to go early..  but super great place. Please be polite and dont liter:::</Review>

The best self service car wash I’ve used in a while. I’m used to one random thing or another not working or there not being soap, that was not the case here. Everything just worked properly and it’s pretty cheap versus some of the others in the area. I will definitely come back when I need a quick DIY wash.<//Text>

The location was not maintained well. The "Pay by Phone Option" would not work no matter what I tried, I even loaded $10 on the App and then the numbers that correspond to the App wouldn't register. When I went to the vacuums I paid, and was so disappointed with the suction that I decided to go home and use my Dust Buster< /Review>

I used the 2nd wash bay and had to pump $20 of quarter into the machine to get my motorcycle halfway clean. The pressure sucks and the tire cleaner selection doesn't spit out any chemicals. There was a pretty long wait because it's one of the only self serve washes in the area.</text>

<review>I have been using this car wash for sometime now and the thing I like best is how much foam you get on the car witch really helps get the car clean 👍 and the vacuums actually have suction so your cars interior comes clean this is the best car wash in the area hands down!< /review>< pictures>

Went here for self car wash and find out there are no blow-dry to dry the car after spray soap and water rinsed. Did I missed something? Also, there are lot of trash on the ground in the vacuum area. I ended up going to another place to vacuum since I don't want to get dust and trash blow back into my car.< /review>

They only take $1s and $5s. Come with change.

Edit: July 2, 2018. Google says they open at 6AM. They do not. It is 7:30AM. And they do not have any hours posted that I could see. Not sure if they’re closed down.< /Review>

<time>1503519036254<//time><rate>1<//rate><review>This place is a rip-off. I went to wash my car and chucked $9 into the machine. Nothing worked. Not the spray nozzles not the soap dispenser not the tire cleaner nor the air dryer. Only the machine that took my money and counted down the timer until my money was gone. There's an email stuck to each of the machines in each of the bays. I sent an email to the owner and no reply. Do not use this car wash because there's no other way to contact the owner. This is piss poor business and I will make every effort to report hymn to the consumer affairs, the Better Business Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission and anyone else who I think might have an impact on this sloppy so-called business.</review>< Pics>

<text>Jesus is very friendly, he went above and beyond letting me use his truck just so I could go get dinner while he worked on my car. Was very transparent with the work. Did an awesome job and at a great price for this quality film. I would highly recommend his business.<//text>< Pictures>

I recommend OC Tintz to anyone!! Jesus knows what he’s doing and he really takes his time. My uncle, brother and I all went to get our cars tinted in the same day. We all LOVE our final product and the tint does a great job at keeping our cars cooler in the sun. If I had more cars to bring to this place, I would! Thank you so much!!!<//text>

We had OC Tintz do window tinting on both of our vehicles and they did an amazing job!  Professional work and great communication are paramount to us and we are definitely satisfied and would recommend them any time.<//Review>

This is the most convenient window tinting service I’ve ever worked with. Jesus came out on time and tinted my windows while I worked in the house. The tint looks great! Very friendly and professional. I would recommend OC Tintz to anyone in the area.<//text>

Jesus did an amazing job tinting my BMW. He operated with extreme professionalism, explained to me what he was doing and why he was doing it, helped me understand the do's and don'ts, and made me feel comfortable along the way. If you're looking for a high quality tint job, look no further!< /Review>

Can't say enough about the fantastic job from start to finish.  Jesus and OCTintz has an easy to use web sign up for confirming an appointment date/time and confirming the services.  Jesus was on time and even sends a text to let you know he is on the way.  Had our old Window tints removed that were starting to bubble and had new ones put in.  Jesus explained the whole process and was very accommodating to answer any questions.  Job was done efficiently and the new tints are exceptional.  Prices for this quality of service are really good compared to others in the area and will be coming back for our other windows and cars.<//review>

In the beginning I didn't know what tint to get and Jesus was extremely helpful by giving me the best recommendations on what tint would be best. Jesus is extremely friendly, great attitude, and puts all his love and care into the work he does. My car was given to me in a timely manor and would get updates on how long it would take for my car to be done.
When I first got my car there were a couple of air bubbles in the windows (which is normal) but after a couple of days they were completely gone and the tint looked absolutely amazing! Really great service and tint, I would highly recommend!</Text><Rating>5< /Rating><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Over the past year we have used Jesus on bi weekly basis and he is always on time.
He takes care of our cars as if it was his own and he always leaves the site clean.
He is careful and goes above and beyond.
Thank you and great partner to have.</Review>

He is always on time (if not early), has a lot of knowledge about car-care products and really takes his time pampering each car he wishes. Not only does he wash my car but the cars of all my co-workers as well! He arrives where ever you need him and if there is something he missed he wants you to tell him about it! Give him a try and you’ll see what I mean.< /text>< pics>

Stopped by Ox Trailer and Dustin got me a great deal in a booming industry where it's impossible to find a trailer. He was very knowledgeable, helpful, and always happy. I've never felt so comfortable with a salesman. I would highly recommend going to see Dustin for all your trailer needs. He's the man!<//review>

<Review>Terrible customer service.
Save money, Shop anywhere else.
All other trailer locations are about 15-20% cheaper.
OX will price match (at least in my case) which was nice. But it was 1 lie after another.

Obviously COVID had a huge impact on production and I don’t fault OX for this but they were basically useless the entire process.
They couldn’t even answer the phone, I was promised several times I would get an update. I wanted to make a change and he came up with every excuse why it couldn’t be done. Finally he said he would call to make the change and then call me back.  Never called back

I finally called to the factory myself and they were extremely friendly. And were able to make changes on the spot.

In regards to my contract,
I was told 6-8 weeks from order date 10 weeks worst case scenario.
After paying my invoice the invoice stated expected delivery date was 14 weeks. When asked about this he said it was a mistake and that it didn’t matter
Because of this there were delays in production.
I was also told that I would be picking up from OX and when I got the invoice after paying it stated factory pickup. When I asked about this, I was told, no “we will pick it up as soon as it’s ready” but this just gives you the option”

Finally got the call today from the factory (not OX) that the trailer was ready and when asked about delivery he said I had to pick it up and if I wanted them to pick it up it would be another 4 weeks.

They are completely useless.
They are shady
They will try to charge you higher price but put a lower price on the invoice to “help” you pay less taxes/registration.

Do yourself a favor and order factory direct; cheaper, friendlier, and faster.

Or just honestly go anywhere else. Don’t get price gouged for shopping “local”</Review><Resp>None</Resp><userid>101041848825410690942<//userid><Time>1619639013842<//Time><gmap_id>0x80c36720eef260a7:0x707bf750de5b4957< /gmap_id>< Rating>

Got a great deal from Dustin when I bought my Dump Trailer and 14’ utility trailer 8 months ago. Now I’m back to get my 16’ utility trailer, because Dustin at OX always takes care of me. He’s got the best hair and deals in the business! Go see him<//Text>

Joe, Shawn and Dustin are terrific people.  I am a repeat customer, having bought three trailers from them now.  Most recently, I made a mistake on the size of the trailer and Joe went out of his way to contact the DMV to get the transaction canceled, refund my money, give me a discount and an upgrade on the trailer.  He had to pay a fee to do it but made it happen.  These folks provide a quality product (Carson) and deliver excellent service always!<//review>

Talked to a man in San Juan Capistrano
who referred me to Dustin at Ox to get a trailer. Ordered my custom trailer with Dustin. Got a great deal and  he walked me through to build it exactly how I need.  Let me pick my color and everything. Great experience and I'll  be back to buy a Toy Hauler. Thanks Dustin at Ox. You're the man!< /review>

I'm in the market for a car hauler. I saw an ad on Craigslist for this place with a trailer priced at $3,500. So I stopped by to look. After waiting for a few minutes with nobody coming out, I walked into the office. One guy was on the phone, the other guy sitting at his desk. I told him I wanted to price a car hauler. The guy said the cheapest one was $5,000. No questions as to what I might be looking for, price range, size etc. Business must be booming for these guys. Since they couldn't take a couple of minutes to help me out. I really didn't want to go "down the hill" to look. But when I do, and purchase, I'll drive by to show them. Sorry I bothered you guys.< /Review>

<Review>Just ordered a custom Carson 6.5’ x 16’ double axle flatbed utility trailer at Ox Trailers in Hesperia, CA.

Dustin was super helpful and knowledgeable about trailers.  He also made several great suggestions that I didn’t think about or consider.  In the long run it might have been a problem but Dustin took care of that.

Awesome place to do business if you need a trailer!!!

Thank you Ox Trailers!!

I had been looking to buy a trailer that would fit my canam and razor and wasn’t having any luck. Someone I knew gave me their number and tried giving them a call. From the first time I called and spoke to Michel Trio she was extremely helpful and answered all my questions. After telling her exactly what I wanted and proceeding to put in an order to have one custom made, Michel continued to help me through every step making sure I got what I wanted. The trailer turned out to be everything that I wanted, it was perfect. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a trailer, again Michel went out and beyond to help me get what I was looking for.<//text>

Shawn was great when we picked up our little 5x8 trailer. He wasnt pushy, answered all my questions and was quick!

We dropped by towards the end of the day and from start to finish it took about 45 minutes.

They had all the accessories i need for my Xterra. Overall it was great, fast experience!

It supports our local businesses too.<//Review>

Great people to work with. I order the trailer I needed. They did not try to sell me anything I didn't need. I ordered a 6.5x14ft with a lift gate on the rear for quads. I was told 4 to 5 weeks to have it built and delivered. Really a great experience. This picture is basically what I ordered but mine is a single axel. What I paid for this brand new is what used ones on Craigslist were going for, and those had no warranty.</Text>

Whoever answered didnt give his name and stated that i was wrong and they wouldnt have posted that trailer with a ramp. He had an attitude and interrupted me to tell me that his price starts at 2100 and only goes up. I am ready to buy right now and he just lost a sale due to his poor service and demeanor. Called on 10/27/20 at 4pm. Hope the owner sees this and corrects his staff.< /Review>< Pics>

If you are looking for the worst customer service in the high desert look no farther then Ox trailer. If I could give this place negative stars I would they honestly don’t even deserve the one start I called before  driving 60 miles down from big bear and spoke with Shawn I specifically told him what I was looking for and asked if they had it in stock and for pricing. Once I made the hour and a half drive down the mountain Only to then find out that the trailer was not in stock and was offered a different trailer with double the price we had discussed on the phone once I expressed I was upset about this issue he had not a care in the world no apology was offered for wasting my time and gas I would never recommend this place to anyone ever.</Review>

Our salesman Ryan was very helpful,  there was no pressure and there were good options for upgrades and colors. The pricing was very reasonable and they're locally built. All good reasons to buy here.<//text>

I went around shopping looking for a low friendly car hauler trailer for a drift car. For a few weeks/months of searching I found Ox Trailers. It was a few hours away but well worth the drive!! I purchased the perfect trailer at a low cost. They financed me with good rates and now I'm off to grange every weekend! Highly recommend Ox trailers, Christian helped me out well even though I was picky lol. I got a 16 foot trailer with a lot of add-ons thanks to Christian.</review>

<Text>Once they have your money they do not care about customer satisfaction. We purchased a trailer from them and had to stay on top of everything with them. Only one person in the office knows what's going on and she doesn't have a set schedule to get a hold of her if you need her. Pay attention to the paperwork. They may tell you one thing and the paperwork conflicts what they are saying. When we went to pick up the trailer when it was supposed to be ready it took over 3 hours to actually get the trailer. Then we find out the trailer brakes didn't even work... We are definitely going somewhere else for our next trailer purchase...< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c36720eef260a7:0x707bf750de5b4957< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) I do not understand why when I buy my 5x8 he gives me a paper where it says to pay 1900 but I pay cash 2100 and he justifies himself by saying that a tow ball was worth 100 and a spare wheel 150, apart from the fact that the invoice said free tire

(Translated by Google) Today I went to the OX trailers in search of a trailer to take out garden supplies and machines for my workers. I searched many towing companies and found OX Trailers. I was not really sure of the size and what my workers' trucks were capable of pulling, but as I explained to the sales representative and told him that the types of vehicles they had had everything for me. He explained very clearly the capacity of weight and even painted me an image of how I can configure the trailer so that everything fits. I could not be happier with your professionalism. I ended up buying three trailers for my company and I could not be happier. I am sure that my employees will be happy and will enjoy these trailers, since it will facilitate the work. Thanks again OX Trailers for the great experience. And anyone who is reading this, I recommend Issac for your general needs or your company, he knows exactly what he is talking about and is very professional.

Hoy entré a los remolques OX en busca de un remolque para sacar suministros de jardinería y máquinas para mis trabajadores. Busqué en muchas compañías de remolques y me encontré con OX Trailers. Realmente no estaba seguro del tamaño y de lo que mis camiones de los trabajadores eran capaces de tirar, pero como le expliqué al representante de ventas y le dije que los tipos de vehículos que tenían me lo habían facilitado todo. Me explicó muy claramente la capacidad de peso e incluso me pintó una imagen de cómo puedo configurar el remolque para que todo encaje. No podría estar más contento con su profesionalidad. Terminé comprando tres remolques para mi empresa y no podía estar más feliz. Estoy seguro de que mis empleados estarán felices y disfrutarán de estos tráilers, ya que facilitará los trabajos. Gracias de nuevo OX Trailers por la gran experiencia. Y a cualquier persona que esté leyendo esto, le recomiendo Issac para sus necesidades generales o de su compañía, él sabe exactamente de qué está hablando y es muy profesional.<//Text>

I had went to The Locker Room of Downey for the first time, I was interested in buying my first fitted hat to match my new shoes. I asked the employee there if they had any purple hats, and she helped me find one that I liked. I checked for my size, and unfortunately they didn’t have it, so I asked her if she knew when they would get more, and she said that she would first check to see if they had any in the back. After checking the back she came back and found one, and said that it was luckily the last in that size. My experience there was excellent, I was very happy to find my first hat that looked perfect with my outfit, I will definitely be back to shop if I ever want to get more.< /text>

I don't live near the store but I knew after my first visit a while back that they would continue to receive my patronage and support.  Not only do they carry great product, but they have an awesome staff.  Everyone is very friendly especially the owners who treat their customers well.  They make long time customers such a myself feel appreciated.  It's a great experience eveytime I go.  Thank you The Locker Room of Downey.</Review>

Amazing customer service and their hat selection is 2nd to none. If you can't find what you're looking at The Locker Room of Downey you don't need it. They have super sick collection of fitted and snap back hats, dope dad hats for the ladies, jerseys, sports memorabilia and so much more. Their collection of Mexican league baseball hats is insane too. Do yourself a favor and stop by, you won't be disappointed. Everyone here is super friendly and extremely knowledgeable. See you guys soon</Text>

Great owner and staff! I felt like I could have easily spent an hour just looking at the different items but I didn't as I was in a hurry. I purchased a LOS ANGELES DODGERS WORLD SERIES CHAMPIONS SIDE PATCH 9TWENTY ADJUSTABLE which I have been looking for since October. I was recommended to check this place out by three of my instagram friends and I couldn't believe to have found the exact hat in stock. Definitely thrilled!
Side Note: I was looking for at least two but happy to have stumbled upon one.  I ended up gifting it to my girlfriend who I plan on proposing to sometime this year. ONLY reason I let go of this hat. LOVE THAT WOMAN<//Review>

Shoutout to Ivan and his team at Locker Room of Downey. Their service is second to none, and will go well out of their way to help their customers will enforcing and maintaining safe practices in and outside the store. I urge the people reading this review to definitely go ahead and visit Ivan at his store whenever you have the chance. You won't be disappointed. Thanks again, Ivan. Until we meet again, I hope all is safe and well with you and your team! Much love, man.

Always try to support  local businesses, but every time my husband and I come here they are always rude.  The lady that works the register throws the bag at us after we purchase something. The older man  manning the store is rude when  we are looking at things.  I work in customer service  and  I know what it means to work with people. We never go in rude or disrespectful so it sucks when  employees come off rude and  disrespectful. Especially when we can go to a corporate store in the mall and buy hats but choose to support small businesses in Downey< /text>

I absolutely LOVE this place.  I’ve been going there for years, since they opened.  Everyone is always so helpful and friendly! They have an amazing selection year round.  Especially for ladies wear, which is often hard to find a good selection. They have a GREAT selection.  Every time I go I see items that aren’t sold anywhere else.  I HIGHLY recommend this place. They have everyone covered. You won’t be disappointed ❤️<//text>

Wide selection of Dodoger's attire. Try shopping in the morning. You might experience a long line, Due to covid regulations they only allow a few customers at a time.</text>

< Review>
This spot here is the best in all of LA to get your lids
and sports gear at. They by far kill the competition. They have a huge selection in your favorite teams to chose from. Lids,fannz,fanatics,etc are put to shame. Ivan and his crew are awesome. Great customer service as well.  Will be back soon for more awesome LA lids....< /Review>

Recieved my 4 hats this Monday after I placed the order on Friday, most places wouldn't have even dropped them off to UPS by then.  Hats are legit new era, funny to read people who got their feelings hurt try to claim they're counterfeit.  Best selection of Dodger hats I've ever seen.  I will be buying more gear from them.<//Text>

I have been coming to the locker room of Downey since for years. Ivan and his staff are great and welcoming. Very knowledgeable about caps and merchandise they sell. If you’re looking for LA exclusive caps you’ll find it here.<//text>

Sent a email about a online purchase that I wanted  to return and exchange because I'm out of state I couldn't come in to the store. It's been about a month and no reply. I call the store and no one picks up the phone ever. Horrible customer services< /Review>

<Review>The Locker Room of Downey, is the Toys R Us of sports merchandise. They have everything you can think of and are a New Era certified seller. The great customer service huge selection of hats, jackets, shirts, cups, jerseys, and keychains are why they are the best...

Why anyone would give these guys less than 5 stars seems crazy to me...these guys have everything for every team from any sport! I went in there specifically looking for a Chargers hat for a bday present and I ended up buying myself a hat as well. If I would've stayed longer I'm sure i would've spent much more than I intended. I highly recommend this place for all your sports needs.< /Review>

This store is absolutely amazing,  they have and carry pretty much anything you can think of as far as sports apparel. Trust me when I say "you'll want to take everything". I recommend this place if you're looking for some heat. Check them out, their customer service is a cut above all.</Review>

<Review>Came to visit family from Hollister in Northern California and my cousin showed us this place. Staff was very helpful and extremely nice, I was specifically looking for Laker gear and found a great selection. Tons of other teams gear too like my Cowboys and A's, great store and staff. Highly recommended and I will be back, they also ship if you find gear you like on Instagram a great add</Review>< pictures>

<text>This store has a variety of merchandise from NFL, MLB, NBA and NHL. The service is good there are employees who are behind the counter plus some on the sales floor to help with any questions. Good price's and lot's of parking. The prices are reasonable which makes you want to spend more. Good place to shop when it comes to sports apparel.</text><userid>103686657767178612588<//userid><user_name>JULIO BARAJAS</user_name>< gmapID>

I am a native resident of Downey and USC grad.  I live on the east coast and visit family in Downey often.  Every trip I stop by The Locker Room to refresh my USC apparel and accessories as well as purchase gifts.  The staff are always friendly and helpful. Downey has changed dramatically since I graduated from DHS in 1979 but I always feel welcome and “at home” when I visit The Locker Room!

One wish....would love if they had a dressing room. 😉</Review>

Which makes it so much convenient also they have a great variety of selections of the Dodgers (great gifts for the whole family or any occasion). Not to mention they have excellent customer service the staff is amazing very helpful especially if you need help looking for an item. Definitely should check it out if you are in the Downey area. Great store!<//Text>< pics>

I love this place! The Locker Room of Downey is the place to go when you want anything you need for sports gear. I buy all my Dodgers gear here. I got the cutest Dodgers sweater there and my daughter's Dodgers jersey too. They carry all sizes for women, kids and men. They're very attentive and took care of me when I was looking for the perfect gift.   I strongly recommend it for all your sports needs!</review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Have been trying to find some Dodger gear before the season starts. I was extremely impressed by the different styles they carry. Not to mention they have NFL, NHL and NBA gear. Although the shop is a bit hidden, it was worth the search. I will no doubt be returning to purchase new gear. The staff is extremely friendly and ready to help you the minute you enter. I recommend this store to anyone trying to find gifts or simply last minute shopping. You should give it a chance if you are near the area.<//text>< pictures>

I come from Riverside all the way to Downey to buy my hats here. They have the BEST selection of hats, all sizes and types. The people that work here and the owners are amazingly great people that help out on every question you have. This sports shop is a must if you seek out to buy a jersey, hat, or anything sports related.</text>

Yesterday, January 22, 2019 I visited your establishment as a consumer with 2 other black people, my sister and brother-in-law, and we were treated as if we were going to steal. Your female employee followed us everywhere we went. She already put the cup I was going to purchase on the counter and was holding it for me. When we were looking at the items in the front by the door she was standing right by the counter lending us assistance and answering our questions. When I went to the cups area she came over and I asked her which one was the Patriots. She showed me and I said I will take it. She asked if I would like the bigger one and I said yes. She said she will hold it at the counter until I am ready to purchase and I said okay. We walked around the store looking at the apparel. As we were standing by the shirts having general conversation and looking at them she came over and started fixing the clothes on the hangers. I was asking her questions about the sports team because I dont know anything about sports but my fiance love sports and since he proposed the night before I wanted to buy him something that I could put his engagement ring into. I figured I would get him a Patriots cup and put the ring inside and give it to him when we go to dinner tonight January 23, 2019. We just happened to walk into the store because we needed to kill time until my other family members arrived at Lock & Key Social Drinkery. We were celebrating my sister birthday which was January 21st and my engagement. I left this establishment without purchasing anything because of the treatment. Let your employees know not all black people steal and I will not jeopardize my government job. My sister and her husband will not jeopardize their government job either. Treat your customers with respect or maybe you just do not want to provide services to blacks. I spent $290.00 at Lock and Key last night. There were approximately 5 staff in your store in different area unpacking merchandise including her. I will not patronize your store due to her behavior and I will share my experience with everyone in all races on social media. This store does not need to be patronized by anyone who accept all races.<//text>

{'time': 1548281629566, 'text': 'I am sincerely sorry you had a negative experience. This particular employee is nineteen years old, it’s her first job and she is in training. All our employees are trained to keep an eye out and to make themselves available to customers, particularly if it’s slow. I’ve had similar experiences and so I don’t want to diminish your interpretation of events. I’ll talk to her, but hope you can also understand that retail is very challenging, particularly small family-owned businesses. We are minority-owned and are sensitive to the racism that exists in the world as we have experienced first hand. We do not discriminate against anyone for who they are. In fact, theft is an equal opportunity act committed by all. Which is why we do ask employees to keep an eye out for anyone, but to also be available to answer questions, bring down merchandise, help customers find what they need or show them things they may be interested in. It’s a tough business but we pride ourselves in being able to provide good service. I am sorry that wasn’t the case for you. I wasn’t there and neither was my partner. If we were we could have tried to guide our employee on when to back off and redirect her elsewhere. Please accept our apology and we will work on further training for our employees and this rookie in particular.'}< /Response>

I absolutely love this place! They ALWAYS come through with Dodger gear. I purchased a Father's Day special edition cap. This hat was sold out everywhere I called and they had it here!  I also purchased couple World Series baseball caps. I didn't bother looking online or visiting another store because I knew they would have them here! I know someone who spent 6 inning at the first World Series game waiting in line to buy a hat to find out they were sold out! Save your time and come shop local at the Locker Room!</text>

The locker room is by far the best sports Store in Los Angeles... to begin with their inventory is amazing, whatever your looking for they have. Their selection of shirts, jerseys,  caps for both men and women is awesome. Not to mention the staff starting with Ivan, he makes you feel welcome from the minute you walk in the store. Everyone there is so friendly and knowledgeable... they go far and beyond to make sure you are satisfied.  I'm there just about every week getting something weather it's baseball, football or hockey season. I shop nowhere else, they will continue to get my business and I refer everyone I know to go there if they want quality and amazing service.<//review>

The customer service is horrible. They act like they want to help but don’t. The person who answers the phone is very rude. I feel they don’t care about the customers. They should be more understanding and actually try to help instead of pretending.</Review>

I've Been Coming here since they first opened, Best Sports Store By Far!
Ivan always helps me out super cool guy, He runs the store and Always gives me his Best opinion! I stopped going to the mall ever since I found this place, Better Quality Better Prices Better Selection! They have all type of Team Gear From Every Sport Especially Dodgers! I love how they provide a huge variety of everything From Jerseys, T-Shirts,Caps, Beanies, Sweaters, Flags, Banners, Mugs, Purses, Blouses, Socks, Keychains etc for men, women, children and infants! I highly recommend this store, even to buy a nice gift for someone it's a good spot! Located on Downey Ave Open Mon-Sunday</text>

This is my favorite go to place for all my team(s) gear! They have a wide selection of the LA teams and the harder to find apparel. Stop by this place if you’re ever in the area!< /review>

I had a wonderful experience with Mendoza & Campos Law Office. Mr. Mendoza was so helpful when it came to all steps of my immigration process. He was honest with me, and was there to guide me through every step. I highly recommend contacting him for your immigration needs. He was honest, there to answer my questions, and prompt in filing paperwork and communication.</Review>

<Gmap_id>0x809ac701b16c50b5:0x7d752d9fc0275455<//Gmap_id><Review>I have the utmost respect for Elias Mendoza and his team of lawyers/warriors who take the time to review each case to make sure they’ll succeed. I have always admired Mr. Mendoza’s knowledge on immigration law and statutes. As a former Univision reporter, I used to go to him as a reliable legal resource to complete my stories and provide viewers with the most accurate possible information. He is fair, honest and transparent in his interactions with current and potential clients.
One attribute that speaks volume to his character is the fact that if he finds that you don’t have an immigration case after a thorough review, he will not take the case. Why do I emphasize on this? Because as a former reporter, I’ve seen cases where attorneys would take a case and charge the client a lot of money knowing that they’ll not succeed in the court.</Review>< user>

I have had my share of "immigration lawyers". Unfortunately, most were a waste of money and most importantly time. I was very fortunate to Meet with Mr. Mendoza and Mr. Campos, as they are in my humble opinion the best at what they do! They were very detailed in the process, explained in a step by step manner that made clear sense of the process and what to expect. Mendoza and Campos Law has  top notch team that I would recommend to my friends and family without a second thought. Their team here in the US and in Mexico made the arduous process much more manageable, not just for me but my family in the US while I was in Mexico going through my interview. I highly recommend the additional services Mendoza and Campos offer when you are abroad as their team there made everything very easy. I highly recommend Mendoza and Campos, as stated before, they have a top notch team. I really appreciated their staff such as Sandra, she was very patient and reassuring during the process.

You will not be disappointed with their services. It has been some of the best money I have invested to date.</Text>

I was looking for a good attorney in immigration law and luckily meet Elias Mendoza.
I try to resolve my immigration issues with different attorneys and no one was able to fix my situation with exception of Mendoza & Campos Law Offices.
Very professional staff in the office, always friendly and the best attorneys to understand about immigration laws.  Very honest and clearly explained all possibilities and never put me in risk.
Very good price for what I get working with them.
Now, I’m a Permanent Resident of this country Thank you to Mendoza & Campos Offices!!!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! Triple A rated Lawyers!

Thank you again for all you guys did for me.   You guys are the best in Northern California!< /review>

<Text>First of all I would like to thank Elias Mendoza and Gabriel Campos, for there help and dedication with my wife’s case. They did a phenomenal job. They help my wife obtain her permanent residency back  on October 2019. My wife and I decided we were going on a vacation to her home town to go visit her family, and friends since she had not seen them in so many years. This happened last Friday, February 28, 2020. At the airport in Oakland California, my wife had to present her documents when they told her she had a warrant issued for her since 2010. Neither her or I knew about. She was arrested then by the U.S Marshalls. I then notified the immigration office about the situation that was happening at the airport with my wife, the staff then told me that a lawyer would then call me, an that's when my phone ring, an it was the lawyer Gabriel Campos,I discussed with him what was goin on, and he told me he would help me in any way he could and made sure I did not feel alone. I was so distraught and blindsided about everything that was happening. Gabriel Campos guided my wife’s federal public lawyer on the case. When obtaining a (Green Card) you have to get your fingerprints done. Doing that shows if you’ve ever been in any trouble or have any warrants. Since my wife did her fingerprints nothing ever showed up. So we were never aware of any warrant. So with that my wife’s Federal public lawyer got her case dropped. We are so grateful to have Gabriel Campos as a lawyer, for his outstanding work ; and would highly recommend his services to any family or friends or anyone who’s in need. Thank you so much.<//Text></record>

After doing a search for a great attorney and unfortunately meeting with ones that gave us false hopes and lots of run arounds, we found this firm. Working closely with Elias, Ryan and Gabriel, I won my case with complete support and confidence in my team of attorneys. They are respectful, understanding and very knowledgeable.  I am eternally grateful they were able to assist my dad with his case and get us results we were hoping for. They were always on top of everything, but never giving us false hope. Honesty and integrity at its finest!  I recommend them to anyone and everyone, they are amazing! Once again thank you to the team for helping my family on our case! 10/10 stars, we will continue to refer people to them forever!< /review>

My husband and I had an amazing experience with them. We dealt with Mr. Campos whom was able to handle our case when a lot of other “good lawyers” were unable to. He definitely delivered and went above and beyond with our case. Their office staff were friendly and provided great service whenever we had a question. The services they offer in Juarez was absolutely amazing as they made our visit there worry free and safe. I highly recommend them as they are professional, courteous  and knowledgeable.< /text>

In March of 2018 I went to speak to Elias Mendoza about becoming a US citizen. After reviewing the facts of my case he encouraged me to pursue my naturalization with the help of his team.  Regardless of your circumstance, I highly encourage people seeking immigration assistance to contact Elias and his team.  They treat you with dignity, respect, and are honest in how they will manage your case.  I couldn't have succeeded in the process without their support. They know there immigration laws in and out. As of May 22nd  2019 I will be attending my ceremony of naturalization and I want to extend a personal thank you to Elias, Brian, and the rest of the team. God bless!</text>

By far the ONLY people I trust. I have been with Elias since 2012 when I first applied for Daca and today, thanks to him, I have just finished my interview for my green card. The future looks so bright and it’s all thanks to him! He’s helped me with my Daca, Advanced Parole, and now Residency! I am so grateful! Thanks Elias for taking me on this journey I couldn’t have done it without you!< /review>

Then just when I was getting ready to give up an old family friend and another friend had told me to call them, so I did and a month if not shorter my husband was released.

Thank you very much for helping to change my life in this country .. highly recommended .. God bless you 🙏🏼🙏🏼

<text>(Translated by Google) Very grateful to the lawyers Mendoza & Campos for taking my case with my two children, I recommend them for such hard work they do in each process.
They helped me in the preparation of each immigration court, appearing with me before the immigration judge in my refugee process, all the administrative staff treated me with great kindness, respect and dignity, they called me on the phone to remind me of the pending documents or any step that is taken in the process, all the lawyers were telling me what step is going on and what kind of documents I have pending to deliver them.
Personally I felt very good every time I visited the office either to make my payments or delivery of documents.
Thank you very much for all the collaboration, professionalism, thank you lawyers Elías, Kevin, Bryan, Gabriela, Ignacio, and Gabriel, God bless you.
I don't know what was outside of me without you.
Blessings and many successes in their work.

En lo personal me senti muy bien cada vez q visitaba la oficina ya sea a efectuar mis pagos o entrega de documentos.

I heard Elias Mendoza in the news and I was surprised, they answered all the questions and I also felt more confident when he told me that he had an office in Ciudad Juarez and if I had my appointment in C. Juarez in February, a lawyer went by me to the airport and took me to a hotel after my very professional appointments I did not have to row and thank you for guiding me to The lawyers I am very happy with the service.

(Translated by Google) My husband had a case and was arrested for immigration, I went and talked with about 10-20 different lawyers and law offices, and everyone told me it was a lost case, that it was impossible to take it out, that my children and I should pack and move to Mexico. Then, just when I was preparing to give up an old family friend and another friend had told me to call them, so I did it and a month, if not less, my husband was released. In the consultation they assured me that he would be home soon and that they were surprised that his case was labeled "impossible." I am extremely grateful that they have recommended it to me and grateful that they have fulfilled their promise. The staff is extremely nice and make you feel welcome, I recommend them.

Mi esposo tuvo un caso y fue detenido por inmigración, fui y hablé con unos 10-20 abogados y oficinas de abogados diferentes, y todos me dijeron que era un caso perdido, que era imposible sacarlo, que mis hijos y debería empacar y mudarme a México. Entonces, justo cuando me estaba preparando para renunciar a un viejo amigo de la familia y otro amigo me había dicho que los llamara, así que lo hice y un mes, si no menos, mi esposo fue liberado. En la consulta me garantizaron que pronto estaría en casa y que se sorprendieron de que su caso fuera etiquetado como "imposible". Estoy extremadamente agradecido de que me lo hayan recomendado y agradecido de que hayan cumplido su promesa. El personal es extremadamente agradable y te hacen sentir bienvenido, los recomiendo.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Better decision to hire these lawyers !!!! They helped us with my husband's entire process from the approval of forgiveness to our appointment in Juarez and my husband was approved at his appointment. They helped us with everything, they helped from the lodging, to organize documents, transfer to the appointment of traces, medical, and letter of antecedents. And they help you in everything and they make you feel very comfortable in the whole process. I recommend it.

<text>A must stop in! It is the only local Thai restaurant, but it is a simple and cozy aesthetic with very kind and genuine service. I do not believe there is a large staff so please be patient with the service. The food is very tasty and I’m honestly a little disappointed that I hadn’t stopped in sooner. This is a little gem here in a small town and I highly recommend you give them a shot. A lot of great comfort food. I can definitely say that this is a new personal favorite. Drop in and support your local Asian American businesses!<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

As others have noted, the building and interior are pretty old and not the most appealing, but the staff were friendly, and our food was ready by the time we arrived after calling it in. After receiving our food, it was quite delicious, so no real complaints, and would consider getting lunch or dinner here again.<//Review>< pictures>

The food was super tasty, but this restaurant was pretty gross inside.  We had no other option in town, and I had just hoped that this mom and pop place didn't cause my celiac partner to have issues.  Staff were NOT masked. Random magazines were everywhere, the kitchen looked like a hurricane hit it.  I KNOW mom and pop places, but just looking at this restaurant inside is enough to not eat there.  But this place has great reviews, so I waited for my food.  Everything was gluten free, and super tasty.<//Text>

Amazing food! The gentleman (I’m guessing the owner) was very cheerful and awesome. He went over the top to make sure everything was great. And it was. I got the garlic chicken dish with some wonton soup. Absolutely the best food I’ve had in Susanville.< /text>

<Review>Though I periodically go to Susanville for work, but the first time I have been to the Whitehouse. My wife and I both agreed that the food was excellent. She had the Pumpkin Curry, and I had the Pad Thai with beef. Both were well prepared. I will definitely go back again!<//Review><GmapID>0x809dbdf078b5b51d:0x189295685f43785a</GmapID><Time>1570074471913</Time>< userid>

Food was good but the poor waitress was working alone & was working her butt off. I believe it was owner/cook came out to bring food to table, brought wrong meal. He also gave our hordouves to table next to us but they didn't complain...never asked why they got but we knew they got ours so we asked & finally got ours. Owner was curt with waitress & all she was trying to do was her job & running her  butt off.  Was bit of a wait to get food but was good.</text>

<Review>Was a little apprehensive because this is a small place and not along the main road, but so glad I listened to the reviews and came in. Haven't had such good Thai food in awhile! We had the drunken noodles and red curry, plus Thai iced tea - all items were hot, fresh, and very tasty. Definitely drop by here if you're in Susanville!< /Review>< Resp>

Just bad. We had curry and a few other dishes and they were very sub par. This is possibly the worst Thai that I have ever had.</text>

I recommend not going here if you want to eat in a clean restaurant. They are very dirty and not very nice employees. Their food is also very dry.<//Review>

Pretty decent thai food - pud thai was good, tom ka gai was decent and the yellow chicken curry was pretty good.  Prices aren't bad.  Best thai food available in Susanville.  There are better places in Reno (Bangkok Cuisine and a few others).<//Text>

My wife and I wanted to try a new restaurant while staying in Susanville. We walked over to the Whitehouse from our motel and had very good chicken pad thai. The people were friendly, and the food and service were both good. Recommended.< /Text>

<Text>I stopped here for lunch as I was passing through the area on my way to the airport. The pad thai, and fresh rolls were amazing, and the red curry was good too. I was pleasantly surprised that this quality of thai food was available in Susanville! I would definitely go back.

Decent food. Service was ok I guess. Could use cleaning. Food was decent but oily. It was an ok visit. Though staff is pushy for tips so if budget is low id recommend avoiding it or just tell them no.< /Review>

Got their 35 minutes before they closed and got denied a table. Will not go back based on principle. My wife and I walked a quarter mile from our motel Room and they were still open but refused to give us a table because they're lazy.<//Review>

We had lunch at this restaurant while passing thru Susanville-we loved the food. Being from the Houston area we know good Thai and this is good. We shared the dumplings,  chicken yellow curry and Pad Thai Beef and all three were excellent. The owner waited on us and was very friendly and good service.<//review>

Food was really good, but the atmosphere and wine list was a little lackluster. Wine prices are highly inflated, and they were out of Merlot.  Service was pretty slow for only having a handful of people eating. Appetizers arrived before our water was finally brought to us (after asking 3 times). Staff was polite and apologetic for the delay, so that was nice.< /review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><text>Though I got there half hour before closing, I could only order to go. I got the fried rice with chicken, which may be the most lackluster 'Thai'' dish I've ever had. It's oily rice with little cubed frozen vegetables, pasty chicken, seasoned with just black pepper. Bleah.< /text><username>Amelia Porterfield</username><Date>1536723228489<//Date>< user>

Had your panang curry Saturday 22nd July. EXCELLENT!! Got it to go. Loved it sooo much! We were driving through and found you on the net and we're extremely happy we did. If I lived in/around susanville I'd eat White House at least twice a week< /text>

What I like about this smoke shop is the prices. I've shopped at other smoke shops are this smoke shop has products that are cheaper than the rest. The inventory is great. They have a lot of nice things. The people running the shop are also nice. They stayed open after hours to sell my cousin some of their products. Great experience!!!< /Review>

<Review>Great Smoke Shop!!! Great Prices!!!! All Smoking products are Available from Phillip Morris to Potfarmers Equipment. (Pipes to Papers).
Owners are also Nice and easy to work with.
Also sells "water" that I've see is popular with alot of people.
It's well kept and always has what your looking for if you Smoke either 1 or both types of Smoke available and Never disappoints.</Review>< Rating>

< Review>
Dude intentionally expired my Marlboro $2 Mobile Coupon.

Intentionally. On purpose. Deliberately.

"I don't have scanner" he says AFTER expiring the app's timer; coming up with the World's Lamest Excuse as in "that only good online, no coupon" which makes him an Extra Special Bozo cheating customers that his diminutive lowness thinks are dumber than him.

No apology. FAIL.< /Review>

They are professional while being very friendly. I am happy to have a place to bring them.<//review><rate>3<//rate>< pics>

<text>These knowledgeable, friendly, and compassionate staff are doing incredibly valuable work. Bring your kids to see animals you would otherwise not be able to get so close to, learn a lot, and expose them to people working hard to help other creatures. Try to be there during the pelican feeding time. It's pretty cool.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMT422CXMVLw4_8teEpQLcw8i7x4Jgmg-rMgx-E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVKTOvLg1BMWdlsFj7WK3X9uWCTYxrr__P6IQs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< resp>

I brought in an injured pigeon and found out a few days later that it had been shot by a pellet gun. Sadly, it had to be euthanized but the person who let me know was kind and explained everything that had been done to try and save the animal. I'm impressed that San Rafael has this wonderful resource and the people who working to help are all dedicated to treating and releasing the wildlife brought in back to their respective areas. Thank you WildCare.< /text>

A person or an animal (probably an owl) had injured his spine, so he was unable to move his hind legs. I took him to Wildcare San Rafael, and they nursed him back to health and re-released him a month later. He turned out to be a rat, but he was so starved he looked more like a vole. They fattened him up and healed up his spine, and now he's running around enjoying life back in the woods where I found him. I will never forget how pathetic he looked when I first found him, and I won't forget how great a job Wildcare did rehabilitating him. My wife and I will be making a donation<//text></record>

<Review>A friend of mine recommended me to call them when a little tiny bird was stuck on my window, the woman that helped me was so kind, I believe her name was Susan.
I got  worried that the little bird was stuck because he was unbothered by my two cats and sat there for a really long time before starting to try to flap his wings.
The woman on the phone was very calm and tried to talk me through what to do, when we started to get a plan together he flew away. She took the time to explain to me why the bird may have been stuck and confused, I really appreciated that because when everything turned out to be fine I felt a little silly.

I’ve heard a lot of great things about WildCare from people that I’ve told this bird story to today, if you need help or advice with these situations they are definitely the people to call.< /Review>< Response>

I found an injured crow at work and was sad to think he/she was going to die if I didn't do anything.  Not knowing what to do, I started googling rescues and found WildCare.  They had instructions on their website on how to handle the situation.  I followed them and brought the bird to them.  They were very friendly, knowledgable and welcoming.  I felt confident that I left the crow in the RIGHT place.  Thank you so very much Wildcare staff.  I'm grateful you were there for the crow and me.  Please donate to their cause.  They are worth it for sure!!<//text>

<Review>They are taking compassionate care of ill or injured wildlife of all sorts and attempting to rehab them to the point where they can be returned to their original habitat.  Kudos to all the staff and volunteers.  There is a public viewing area of some of the treated wildlife including large birds of prey with information about them.  Worth a visit.< /Review>< pictures>

I went with a group of my students to drop off a baby bird that was found on the ground all wet in the rain. We checked him in and they gave us a patient number so we can check in on him. Then we had the great opportunity to watch one of the staff with a spotted owl as she spoke about the beautiful bird with a small group. There are many kinds of animals from our area. Go check them!< /review>

<text>One of the coolest places I've had the pleasure of visiting lately. Friendly staff is there to help if you have a wild animal that needs help. We found a baby bird, not knowing what it was, we drove it to wild care to take care of and they determined it was a baby pigeon with a head injury. They're one of the only places that will care for pigeons. While we were there, we got to see a beautiful owl, vulture, hawks, and other creatures. Would highly recommend Wild Care!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Amazing organization that takes care of injured local animals of Marin County with the aim of release back into the environment-  any injured local wild animal , including a mouse, will be accepted - No discrimination here!  💕  (please do not take your domestic pet to this place- this is for wildlife).  Additionally they offer classes and tours that teach you about the local animals that live around us.   Visit at lunchtime to see the feeding of residents that were unable to be released due to injury.  Great to know a place like this exists.  Also- wild care has a hotline that you can call 24/7 for assistance with any injured animal you may find.  💕💕💕♥️.  Also there is plenty of volunteer opportunities here should one be be interested - They also accept donations of $$, foods, meds, etc (see list on website) that they can use for their organization and its mission. 💕❤️< /review>

WildCare is THE BEST place to help with injured/sick wildlife staffed with dedicated, caring people. This is a real treasure right here in San Rafael that provides services like no other. I've been aware of their work for over 30 years! Thank you so much in educating me about co-existing with our beautiful creatures.<//Review>

WildCare is the best wild animal hospital, with really dedicated staff, including the many volunteers who make possible the hard, and very delicate care for orphaned and injured animals!
The couple of times we have taken wild animals here, they take in the patients right away, and visited being so courteous, they gave the patient number in case you want to call and get report in the progress of the animals you helped. And even they ask if you would like to be involved in the return to the wild of the animal after it is ready for!
It is amazing, and we learned about some of the programs and education they do at this place, and that they will be moving to a bigger place to keep with the demand of their wonderful job!
We started to join Family Adventures with Marco Berger, and we have been delighted with his knowledge and the places he has chosen for the adventures. We highly recommend to join this great FREE OUTDOORS adventures!<//review>

<text>Wildcare provides a great service to the community. Besides taking care of the local animals in need, they have a great courtyard where you can come visit and see some of the animals that can't be released back into the wild. We particularly like the hawks, turkey vulture, and owl.< /text>< pictures>

<text>A one-of-a-kind facility that's like an SPCA for wild animals. They do all sorts of pro bono veterinary work, and have an interactive wildlife zoo for kids. They also do housecalls for injured wild critters--but those'll cost ya'.< /text><user>110981658875754251717<//user><response>None</response><pictures>None</pictures>< rating>

Very friendly and helpful staff. We brought in an injured bird which sadly didn't make it. If you bring an animal in, they offer the option of calling to let you know how the animal is doing and will even ask if you would like to be present for relocation of the animal you rescued. Love that they offer this.<//review>

(Translated by Google) The ugly place was also attended by a very pedantic woman who did not answer me when I kindly asked her how she is?

< Review>
Had what I was looking for, were super helpfull with a small technical issue I had booking a piece of equipment, and everything ran smoothly! They've adapted wonderfully to Covid19 problems, and even included some alcohol swabs to wipe down the equipment before it was returned. The only drawbacks I encountered were some weirdness with their website and booking system, (which a very knowledgeable employee was able to sort out for me very quickly), and a very small parking lot, (which wasn't really an issue for me), though it might be in a time of higher demand. They have amazing pricing, which was significantly better than I expected, and the equipment was flawless! Awesome experience overall, and would definitely recommend!< /Review>

<review>We rented two camera bodies and a few lenses (in Oct of 2020) and our order was shipped via UPS in two separate packages. However, we only received the camera lenses (late Friday afternoon) due to a UPS delay which would leave us sans cameras for the weekend (no bueno!) With a single call to their customer service line, they determined the issue, and offered to overnight two camera bodies to a UPS store on Saturday so we could make our Sunday event. Thank you! We will be doing business again.< /review><user_id>101603595441366429386<//user_id>< Response>

I went back, the website still said available, but wouldn't let me check it out. I am working a game later today and wanted to try out the equipment, but I guess I'm SOL.

< Review>
Serious Reviewer -

| 5 Stars - Quality Product - No security deposit |

First off for the price borrow-lens is unmatched and they put a lot of trust in their customers.

I rented a Canon 5D MIV - 50mm 1.2 - 35mm 1.4 - 600 Flash - Extra Battery for 10 days! Return label and all!

The equipment arrived in three days in a Pelican hard shell case with fully charged batteries

I highly recommend!!< /Review>

<Text>My experience has always been good here. The lenses that i borrow are mostly in fine condition. The Representatives are always happy to help.
The website provide good offers during holidays. Starting with regular redeem codes to the extra free days on holidays.
At times the system does not send me any mail on day is pick up that the item is ready or not.  That time you have to either call them or use the chat option to communicate.
I find their chat system good and helpful ONLY when it works. Many a times the whole chat system is unavailable even if it is not supposed to be.
Overall it is a great place to borrow a lens for tries trips.< /Text>< resp>

<userid>106166480374839883259<//userid><review>Just WOW!

I lost all of my equipment to the devastating Camp Fire in Northern California last year. In my quest to re-build technology has changed. It is a HUGE commitment to purchase everything that was lost, so I thought I would give a few pieces a "run for the money" before committing to purchase.

For 10% of my replacement purchase cost I get a full week trial run with up to date equipment, which came almost over-night and expertly packed. The order (rental) process was simple and seamless, and the equipment received in excellent condition.

Could not be happier!</review>< Name>

My son and I are Nikon shooters and own the D500 and 200-500mm combo along with a 300PF prime. We've been thinking about upgrading to a full-frame so we rented the new Sony 200-600mm lens and A7R IV body to try them out. We've seen very sharp pictures from this combo online and was excited to try it out. We rented the combo from BorrowLenses for a week over Thanksgiving to make sure we had the time to try it out in all sorts of situations.

When we got the lens and took my first pictures however, the photos were coming out very soft at the long end. After using the lens for a couple days and trying it out with multiple different camera settings it was clear that this lens was not producing anywhere close to the sharpness to what we've seen from others online.

Having spent hundreds of dollars to rent this expensive gear, it was disappointing that a company like Borrowlenses would not take the responsibility to ensure they have sharp copies for renters especially with their high-end gear. Moreover, when I returned the lens and explained the issue they replied a week later saying the lens is within specs and we probably did not know how to use it, which is insulting to say the least.

We've rented from other lens rental places (e.g. LensRentals) in the past and never had a problem getting a good version of the lens or taken care of once you point out an issue. If you still have to rent from Borrowlenses, take your iPad, shoot a few photos and check out the gear thoroughly before you accept the rental.< /text>

If you want unnecessary stress over getting your package on time then go ahead and order from them.

The first time I ordered, I called to complain and the lady I spoke with had an attitude and told me “next time instead of having it delivered to your house, pick it up from ups.”

This time around, I do that to ensure I get my package on time and I even ordered it a few days earlier than I needed it just to make sure I get it early, and i still haven’t gotten it. I know they have no control over UPS, but they ship the day before and it’s not guaranteed you’ll get it the day of. And after speaking with customer service, this seems to be an issue they continue to have, so why not change their shipping carrier? It’s really ridiculous and unfair!!!! Save yourself the headache and don’t order from them!</review><GmapID>0x808fa240811369bf:0x6f24755fcb23f7d8<//GmapID><Rating>1<//Rating>< Pics>

Just borrowed my first lens for my trip to Grand Teton National Park and Yellowstone. SO glad I found this place.

Service was excellent. Lens quality was excellent. I borrowed a 14-24mm ultra wide angle lens for the landscape shots and was so glad I did!! I really want to but this lens now but it's 💰💲🤑.

Will be back to borrow other lenses and experiment! 😀< /Text>

Great place to rent all kinds of cameras and camera equipment.  You are best to call the 800 number and talk to an employee to arrange everything you need and then pick up at the store.  There is no showroom or anything like that and some of the stuff needs to be sent from another location, so call ahead.< /Text>

<Review>The best place in bay area to rent any kind of gear you need. The service is outstanding. Offers are amazing . Customer centric business model. They value custimer needs. Its not a paid review, i just love borrow lenses. Their service staff is very knowledgeable.  I always go to pick up 5d mark iv, even if its not there in store, they get it from SF office jist to give it to me. Many times this happened.  Sometime staff gives some amazing discounts.  I recommend every photographer in bay area to try this store at least once . You will love everything about it . Also they have cine gear and lenses for very resonable price. One stop for your video production needs. You will not be disappointed :)</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

They use UPS to deliver and even admitted they fight with UPS on a daily basis and use them because their cheap. UPS outsources their customer service (the reason they're cheap) so if there's a problem with the delivery, then you will easily lose a couple of days from your lens rental. What's worse is that I called BorrowLenses to tell them about my issue, they did nothing about it. Good customer service would be offering me an extra day on my rental since I basically lost 3 days due to their carrier of choice. Will never rent here again.< /text>

I'm putting this review up so people are aware of Borrow Lenses. I purchased a DSLR camera and lens to get back into photography and videography, I've scheduled a photoshoot a few weeks in advance and decided to rent the same gear from them as backup for a second photographer. The package was to be delivered and signed for by me, but it was never recieved. UPS opened an investigation and concluded that the package was lost and to reach out to the seller. I did so only to be met with threats of being sued, criminal charges files, etc. Demanding to send their camera back (the one we PURCHASED elsewhere) because they assumed it was theirs.

I told them to contact my attorney because I have no problem with providing proof of purchase. They ultimately reopened the investigation with UPS again only to once again conclude the package was indeed LOST. Thankfully, I purchased warranty in the even the gear is lost, stolen, or damaged which allows me to pay a deductible of the equipment. However, they never bothered to mention it when I told them UPS's results. They still firmly believe that the gear we bought is theirs. However, since UPS lost the package and it was never in my possession, I had to send proof to my bank for a refund I paid to rent the gear.

Absolutely horrible customer service, attitudes, and assumptions. Completely unwarranted behavior.< /review>

I purchased a FF Nikon and immediately discovered I was lens poor.  I have rented locally and from BL.  If you value your time, BL has great rates.  I used a 10 day rental on 70-200 2.8 that I was considering.  The lens is sublime, it arrived on time, with hood & UV filter, nice... I sent it back by dropping it off at my office.  I received an email response when BL received it back.  What could be better?  A $2,000 lens delivered when you want it.

I discovered that the lens is really heavy for what I want to do.  I loved it and will rent from time to time, but I will save my $$ and buy something better suited to me.</review>

<review>I have a Nikon D750. I rented 2 lenses a Nikkor 105m macro and a 35m simga art. Macro worked great. Sigma arrived with a figure smudge on the rear glass element and ended up with major focusing issues(front focusing). Couldn't risk soft images so I ended up not using it at all. I called the company the next day and got a bunch of blame shifting. Rep told me it was my camera body, which didn't make sense as I used 3 other lenses for that event and all worked great. I was told they would check on it for me. Called them back about 1 week later and was told by the same guy that their lens were fine. Really frustrated by my first experience with this company. I paid for something that didn't work and in the end it was my word against theirs. I was lucky I owned my own lenses and my work didn't suffer but had that not been the case this would have been disastrous for a wedding photographer.  2 stars because the macro I rented worked great! Unfortunately, I couldn't recommend this company.<//review>< pics>

Gosh I really wish my experience with BorrowLenses was a good one. They shipped me a SmallHD monitor with no ac charging cord for the battery pack. I called and said there's no cord, they said they'd overnight one to me- great. Next day, and the day after- no cord still. I emailed and said I never got one, they said UPS dropped the ball and that they will refund me once the order has been returned. Order returned, and they have the balls to charge me $50+  for the missing cord. WHAT! Also, they are charging me to weight disks on a glidecam when in fact it is in the backpack. I will never use Borrow Lenses again, and I will most certainly caution other photographers never to use them until this problem is resolved.</Text>

<Text>I don't often write reviews, but I feel compelled to write one now. I received misinformation about the return of an item from a customer service agent and ended up needing to pay a huge late fee. Also, customer service was very rude and condescending. I would avoid dealing with them. There are so many better cheaper options.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I am leaving for Iceland today with the sole goal of capturing the northern lights. Since I didn't have the best equipment, I decided to rent it from BorrowLenses. It was supposed to arrive at my door step yesterday. But it didn't. I have to leave for the airport in an hour and I'm without a camera now. Their customer care is not responsive, usp is not responsive. Terrible business ethics which clearly does not understand the need of their customers. They've clearly failed me.<//Review>< rate>

Overall nice concept but I wish they'd be more accommodating to walk-ins. Their homepage is also not great at knowing what's available at a specific location. Finally .. the prices are a bit steep. A 5 day rental is basically 10% of the lens price< /Text>

<Review>I would love to give them a better review, but in the last 18 months I've rented from them 3 times. One time I got the lens on time , the other two times I didn't get any lens. I typical don't rent a lens unless I've got a trip planned. This has left me in a lurch twice now before a trip.
The first time I was renting a lens for the eclipse, I ordered several weeks in advance to beat the crowd. A few days before delivery I contacted them to confirm and I was told that they didn't carry that lens yet because it was a new release ave that they had a glitch in the system. And that they were out of everything else, so sorry we'll happily cancel your order. With no other options I had to buy a lens on Amazon.
Second experience was good lens came as promised and was in great shape. I thought"These guys are great!".
Third experience, I got a ups alert for delivery the day it was supposed to be delivered showing that deliver would be for the next day.  That worked out well because I needed it on Thursday not Friday. Funny how vacations aren't quite that flexible. Customer service tried to be helpful to ship it to my destination but no viable ups store. Boom, order cancelled again.
And not even an offer to give me a credit or give me the same promotion at a later date.

Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.  1 out of 3 is enough for me to move on.
If you are in the market to just try a lens and you are ambivalent to the arrival day, then these guys are great. If you need it for a specific day go somewhere else or pay for a few days extra so that they can ship it to you late, but really you fooled them and got it early.</Review>< pics>

Rented D610 and 24-120mm. Lens had focus problems all day long. It refused to auto focus after it hit infinity/macro. Had to manually turn the focus ring to get it auto focus again. Focus seeking problem also persists throughout the rental period. Sensor on D610 was filthy. I would think sensor cleaning would be one of the routine maintenance on a rental camera but nope. Even at F/6 dusts on the sensor was a big problem for all my photos. Probably wouldn't bother using their service again. Go with other rental companies if you can.< /Text>

<text>Rented a teradek bolt and some other items, however none of it worked and the firmware was 5 versions behind.  Before I had rented the equipment I had asked if everything was up to date and I was told it was however it wasn’t.  The wires that came with the rental were broken as well.  I had informed the tech that took the return regarding the problems and I was told that they would get back to me later in the day however they never did. 4 days after the return I called them to see what the status was and they told me there “too busy”. This place is a joke and is as unprofessional as they come. Stay away and go to lensrentals for better service and better maintained equipment.<//text><Date>1533857302771</Date>< username>

Borrowlenses bases its identity around shipping rental equipment to customers.  The nature of its equipment and customers requires accurate timing and delivery or the service is without point.   However it appears to have no safeguards in place to help ensure customers will receive the equipment they have paid to rent.

The first occasion I rented from Borrowlenses several items in the order were unavailable as they had not arrived at the pickup location.  Borrowlenses did not have a deep enough inventory to offer me even basic alternatives I could use to work around items they had failed to deliver to THEIR OWN LOCATION on time.

On a more recent order I requested delivery of my equipment two full days ahead of my scheduled need for it in order to ensure there was time available to correct errors.  The equipment did not arrive until after my need, a full three days late.  And only arrived at all because I actively when onto a UPS site and corrected their shipping label errors.  No one from Borrowlenses noticed that UPS had failed delivery or took any steps to contact me to let me know delivery information needed correction, even after delivery had failed twice and was now two days late.

Borrowlenses then refused to refund the cost of equipment that I was unable to use and had to source from another vendor.  They offered a partial value credit to my account Borrowlenes account, a remedy far short of any professional standard as it is entirely useless in a professional setting where clients must be billed for charges and credit card statements must be balanced.

A company offering to provide equipment by mail for the time sensitive business of video production must be ready to guarantee delivery or refund cost or will find no place of use amongst any kind of professional.</Text>

I rented a Nikon D600 and chose to pick it up at a local participating camera shop.  EASY & convenient!  I had a minor problem with the camera and emailed BorrowLenses and received a response almost immediately.  They offered to send a replacement straight away!  Very pleased here!</text>

< review>
I rented a lens, that I am considering buying, for a weekend trip. I booked the lens a week in advance and received a call the day before I was supposed to receive it that it was overbooked and not available. After asking some questions, the representative told me that the all copies of the lens I booked had been sold and they would not have any copies to rent until the following week. Clearly their inventory system has issues.

They did offer an upgraded rental at no additional charge, but I wasn't interested in any other lens.</review>

I needed to test out a Fuji X series lens on my X-T1. Since BorrowLenses has been on my radar for about two years now, the decision to utilize their services was an easy one. Especially after they opened a NYC branch for pick-up and drop-offs.

I was pleased to find the entire process very straightforward and as accommodating as can be for me as a consumer. The process began online, followed by a security and verification fax. I then visited the office in New York City to pick-up and drop-off the lens.

In short, the lens was clean and in great shape. The service online and in-person was absolutely top-notch. I highly recommend them for anyone who needs to rent or try out photographic gear.</text>

<user_name>Dominic Uliano<//user_name><Text>Had a phenomenal First Time experience with Borrow Lenses a couple weeks ago.  Borrowed a Nikon 12-24mm f/4.0 lens for a trip to Maine.  The experience of finding and ordering the lens was very easy and straight forward.  The lens shipped via Fedex and arrived ontime.  The lens itself was in superb condition.  Even sending the lens back was easy as they provided a return label and packaging.

This is what renting camera equipment should be like.

I am planning a trip to San Francisco in a couple weeks.  I just ordered the same lens but this time I will be picking it up at a location near where I will be staying. Sure it will be a super good Second Experience!

<review>These guys are awful to deal with.  I was a potential customer and had placed an order for over $600.00 that I no longer needed because they did not accept my insurance.  Hey, thats all fine and dandy but what wasn't OK was them charging my credit card even though I cancelled the order 2 weeks prior.  On top of that, they knew I was not going to use them because of the insurance issue.  I'm still in the process of getting that $600.00 back.  I may adjust my rating if they fix the issue.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I have rented through BorrowLenses over the past few months and find their business to be extremely reasonable, cost effective and efficient for my needs. Their customer service is on point and I enjoy meeting their friendly and knowledgable staff every time I pick up or drop off equipment. I also like the fact that they have computers on-site because a few times, I've had to recreate my order and the process is a lot quicker when I can create the order myself. Keep up the Good Work!</Text>

<Gmap_id>0x808fa240811369bf:0x6f24755fcb23f7d8< /Gmap_id><text>Not sure how to rate this experience. The renting process itself was smooth but my troubles started later on.

I went on my trip and discovered that neither the AF nor the AE function on the "Nikon mount" Rokinon lens I rented worked with the Nikon D800 camera body that I also rented. I tried all possible combinations of menu and physical switches that control the AF/AE functionality but none of them seemed to resolve this issue.

Suffice it to say I messed up quite a few pictures. The lens would often go out of focus (the focus ring would shift/rotate under gravity such as when I am shooting a video while walking down a hill) and I would not even realize that this was happening until I review the video later on.

Another issue that I constantly faced was that the AE information was simply not being passed between the camera body and the lens. The lens was rated from f/2.8 to f/32 but I could only ever get the actual aperture to be set between f/5.6 to f/11 -- and I am pretty sure I tried all kinds of shooting mode such as programmed, shutter priority, aperture priority, etc. This ended up ruining a lot of my bracketed images that simply did not bracket because they were being "limited/saturated" on the extreme ends of the EV spectrum.<//text>< rating>

< Review>
My one and only experience with borrowlenses went like this:

Booked my lens, uploaded every detail of my identity to their website, bought additional insurance on my camera policy to cover the lens, booked a whale watching cruise, and booked a trip to safari west (plus scheduling a day off work). In other words I planned a 3-day weekend revolving around the lens I reserved.

After all that, got a call the night before my scheduled pickup and was told the lens was overbooked and unavailable.

This leads me to believe that one of the following is true:

(1) The website is unable to track inventory of available equipment.
(2) My reservation was dropped in favor of a more preferred customer.

Either case is completely unacceptable.

As you might imagine, I'm not at all happy about this.< /Review>

<name>Jim Regent<//name><Time>1344023645160<//Time><rating>5< /rating><Text>I have rented a number of items here in the past. For a while, during the height of wedding season, I would place orders every other week. All the lenses and cameras would come packaged and bundled with enough foam to keep them secure. They use plastic bags to keep the dust out of the lenses, in the event a cap comes off in transit, which is a nice touch.

Last year was the only time I experienced a problem was when a Canon 24-70mm lens that I was renting arrived with a smashed filter. It seemed to work fine, but when I requested a replacement just in case. The replacement lens arrived the following morning, in time for my shoot.

I really could not be happier with these guys! They run an excellent outfit, and the friendliest customer service I have seen in a while.</Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808fa240811369bf:0x6f24755fcb23f7d8< /gmapID></record>

<Text>I rented my usual camera body, 70-200, and my favorite 24-70.  The 24-70 had issues with focusing at the long end.  I had to come out, focus, and them come in again.  Regardless to say it was broken.  It was frustrating not having a working 24-70.  I had other lenses to cover it but. . .  So I e-mailed them about it and they refunded the cost of the rental for just that one lens.  I wasn't using the equipment to shoot birds, no offense to bird shooters, or my kids playing in the backyard.  I used them for my work and the equipment failed.  I'm disappointed that they didn't refund my whole order.

I don't want to give these guys a bad review but this was my first experience renting from them.  Usually I rent from Calumet but Calumet has really bad customer service.  Time to look for another place.</Text>< name>

Borrowlenses hates policy of not accepting international cards. I hate them for this policy. Lose-lose situation. At the same time, same cards may be used to pay for much more expensive rentals such as cars. Weird world, weird policies, weird Borrowlenses.<//Review>

Ordered a lens on Friday for a Saturday night project.  I called before placing the online order to confirm stock and delivery.  I spent half a day researching the lens, where I was going to shoot, etc.  Paid for delivery to their drop off spot in San Francisco.  Drove from the Eastbay to pick up the lens and it was not at the pickup point.  It was too late to call Borrowlenses as they were closed. So, my whole Saturday-Sunday project thrown out the window.  It was like having the wind pushed out of you.  I emailed them and never received a response back so called.  I got same brain dead guy who put me on hold for 15 minutes and then the phone just hung up.  I called back an hour later and got someone else who said they did not know what happed to the lens and said, Sorry.  In my book Sorry does not cut it as this was a huge disappointment.  I still have not received a credit memo from them on my CC card charges.  Icing on the cake, I just received an email from them reminding me the lens is due back tomorrow!!! Unreliable, poor customer service.<//Text>

order number  219680   Dec 19 2012
WATCH OUT FOR EXTENSION FEES!!!  i ordered a camera for 3 days at 99 (a week rental is 136) when i asked to keep the camera the rep on the phone said no problem,   i said i will keep it for a week and they said ok, then i returned the camera  a couple of days pass the the three day original rental   i understood that they would charge the difference of the week rental  from the three day rental  a (fee increase of $37)  they hit me with two extension fees of $30 per day  WTF... so i was charged over $70 for the additional two days  THE REP OF THE PHONE WAS MISLEADING ABOUT THIS INFORMATION ...   this was the first bad experience from borrowlenses.....to keep a customer you think they would have just  charged me the difference ...  i would seriously MAKE SURE OF YOUR RENTAL WINDOW becuse they do not poses the technology  or they purposely  choose NOT TO WORK WITH YOU ..  hope they make this more clear in the future AND TRAIN THEIR STAF BETTER ....< /text>

<text>Parking always an issue and worst drivers for a small area. Convenient post office and drive thru mail drop. Just don't go inside. Lines are long and 1 person working. Then another man came out and she went on a break. Patrons have timely issues and could be at window for 10 mins. Or longer if more than one package to send. Need more staff.</text>< Response>

When I was in college Lakeshore plaza was my place to come run errands. You can practically find everything you need is this dense shopping center. Parking is a bit tricky and if you come during busy times expect to spend about five minutes looking for parking. The parking spaces are compact, but if you have a small car you can park without any issues. My favorites spots here are Noah’s Bagel, Lucky, Hawaiian BBQ.<//review>

We always want to support business!!  Why the heck did they let UPs park all their trucks in that place with all of us??  It’s a mad house with the post office already!  And then you add those brown trucks all day!  At least Fed Ex only comes by twice for pick ups and out of there!  It’s a great one stop shop otherwise!!<//Review>

Really like this place, and I tend to visit Ross, and Lucky more so. Good amount of parking, and there's also a Post Office. Pretty convenient if you live in the neighborhood.</Review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>Currently not as accessible by public transport as it once was. I blame Muni. Ross has closed down parts of its store. Albertsons feels like a discount market but don't be duped. The eateries are tired and overbored fed. Noah's bagels and Peet's coffee used to be stellar, but the quality has suffered.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Nice neighborhood outdoor mall with plenty of parking. Anchor stores include the Lucky grocery store and Ross. It has various cafes and casual dining and services such as UPS, FedEx, Post Office, AAA, and salons.  Noah's for breakfast, Chipotle for lunch, Ono Hawaii for dinner.< /text>

Parking could be challenging but there's parking in the surrounding streets. If you plan ahead you have a lot of different things/ errands to accomplish because of the variety of shops in the Plaza.</Text>

It’s a cute little circle of shops including Rosa, luckys, Noah’s Bagels, chipotle and petco! If you are looking for quality spa, there is one (needs appointment in advance). Ups and usps too.<//text>

<Text>Plaza has a lot of options no matter what you need they have a store for just about anything and everything you need. Good mix of smaller stores with big name big retailers and grocery. Only bad thing is the Trader Joe’s line just to get inside gets very long  especially on weekends. Worth checking out if you live near by nothing to go out of your way for.</Text>< userid>

The crowd is picking up but social distance is still in effect. Went to the plaza for shopping. I was able to get the clothes, dog supplies, and food for myself. Everything went smoothly.</Review>

This is a great shopping mall in the Sunset area. I like that it has each kind of store for every member of the family. There's also parking that's a rarity in San Francisco.
I personally love that there's a pet store, supermarket, Ross and the Big Five all conveniently in the plaza.
I recommend going to the Lakeshore Plaza if you needa run errands in the west side of San Francisco.</text>

Its a good mini mall area to browse but theres better ones out there. This one is good if you're gunna go to Ross or Big 5 or get something to eat like Noahs Bagels or that boba place. Its small and you can finish the whole walk trip in like 10 mins or less. Oh and theres a Luckys Grocery Store which has good stuff too. I like coming here if i wanna go to Ross. I do miss Gamestop though when it was still in this plaza.</Review>

I remember when QFI and GET were here. My mother would by me shoes at GET. Then she would buy groceries at QFI. Years later sometimes bought shoes at Big 5. I went to the Social Security office her with my mom when she got older. ( They're closed now.) I used to take my dog Ace to the pet store here. I went to Fedex (That used to be Kinko's) to make some copies. Then I went to Peet's for coffee and Lucky's for groceries.< /review>

A great place with lots of stores, including BIG 5 SPORTING GOODS, LUCKY SUPERMARKETS, PETCO, ROSS DRESS FOR LESS, UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE and more. Whether you want food or clothes, groceries or a Post Office Box or even more, Lakeshore Plaza has something for you. Parking usually isn't at all an issue, there's almost always space near enough to where you're going.<//Text>

Convenient Parkside location. Lucky, USPS, FedEx, UPS, Wells Fargo, Petco, Big5, Pete's coffee, etc. Parking is poorly designed, so minus 1 star.</Review>

The reason I’m giving only three stars is because our amazing new hairdresser is not listed! His name is Tony at TS Hair Design. He manages to give my squirmy toddler granddaughter a lovely haircut and my picky daughter, as well! Did a great job with her color, too.</Text>

<review>It's a great place for getting a lot of errands done as there are multiple shops in the vacinity.  However, the parking lot can be quite maddening trying to look for parking as well as trying to leave the parking lot.  It can be somewhat unnerving if you are in a hurry or lack the patience dealing with congestion... overall it's a convenient little shopping hub.<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<text>Really nice plaza with an abundance of much needed stores, such as Lucky grocery, Big 5 Sporting Goods, and various eateries. Most importantly, it has PARKING!!! In San Francisco, finding a shopping center with parking is almost impossible, so it's really nice to finally not have to battle other cars for street parking.</text>< pictures>

Home to Lucky and Ross, among other popular shops, this shopping plaza offers many choices for food, grocery, and shopping.

While parking are aplenty, the layout of the shops does not necessarily encourage shoppers to visit the entire plaza, which I believe many one of the reasons shops tend to open and close fairly regularly, except some of the big names aforementioned. However, even Game Stop couldn't avoid the fate of closing their doors here.

You may be surprised to find that Albertsons actually owns both Safeway and Lucky, but as this is the only Lucky store in the City, in my opinion, it is still worth a visit.  While prices aren't always comparable to Safeway, they carry some unique selection that I just haven't found in any Safeway in the City.</Text>

This is a very good place in the city since it has a lot of things that you need. You can eat there, supermarket, buy cloth, get insurance,post office, bank. Everything there simple. Parking is big enough and easy public transportation also. Also, there is a Verizon store and yummy boba tea there and of course coffee shop. Great place</Text>

<text>I can go to Lakeshore Plaza and take care of numerous things in one trip. I get packages delivered to either UPS or FedEx often. I have them hold the packages for me to pick up. Safer than being left on doorstep. They have a Petco and my dog loves going there to buy her food, toys, treats, or get her nails clipped. There's a post office where I buy stamps and a Ross that has many different things I need. I also like going to get shoes and clothes from Big5. There are a few places to get a bite to eat and a Lucky's where I can grocery shop and I use their pharmacy as well. The AAA office has saved me time when registering my vehicle. It is convenient to be able to do all these things in one place instead of using up gas and my time traveling to many destinations. Im glad its there.<//text>< Pictures>

Busy spot with a lot of options. Parking lot can be hectic at time so be careful. Lots of decent shops are packed in this little plaza and it gets pretty crowded at times. If you're looking for something there's a good chance you'll find it here.<//text>

< Review>
Love stopping by the shopping area at The Grove. Love how there is a Topshop and Zara. Love it even more during Christmas time, when all the lights and decorations are put up. It's so pretty and it just gives you such a joyful feeling. Such a cute shopping area to walk around and would definitely make a stop here again whenever I'm in town!<//Review>

Free parking.  Lucky grocery usually beats safeway pricing. Ross is nice but cluttered.  u c medical offices with free parking is great & unique pet shop. good thai food is tasty & not too expensive.  Nice staff there.  Hawaian Ono is nice for variety.  My dentist is also there.  Add an Aritaum store & a K Pop Beauty store.< /text>

<text>Do you want a massage? How about breakfast or lunch? In the mood to do some shopping? Need to a grab something at the grocery store? How about your favorite sports item? Well let me tell you, Lakeshore Plaza has all of that and more, conveniently located, lots of parking, you truly can get it all here! Situated right off of Sloat BLVD.  It seems it's becoming harder and harder to find great plazas like this which offer just about everything you need with the likes of online shopping, however this is just as easy and to be honest there is no waiting and zero shipping fees, lol!<//text>< Pics>

Great neighborhood shopping mall on the outskirts of San Francisco on the way to the zoo. Its refreshing to find one stop shopping  in a big City in one central place. Parking can get tight on weekends but I've always found a space.< /Review>

I really like Lucky super market. Their produce is great, but they are often pricier than Safeway. They have more Jewish foods than most Safeways & more gluten free selections. They also have great sales on meat! My daughter patronizes Massage Deluxe & loves it. The hair salon is great too & they sell higher end products. I really like this "strip mall" in the burbs of San Francisco!<//Text>

Love2shop the Ross for less because it is so clean, well-stocked, good service and is the best in San Francisco. I would go here again and again over any other Ross in San Francisco. E-Z parking. Also the Hawaiian barbecue at this shopping plaza yes delicious. But the location is a little bit hidden acid this off main circle of the shopping center. My favorite is the teriyaki chicken second best for me is the crispy chicken. The barbecue sauce is too too sweet or too too hot. Very casual.<//review>

Nice outdoor mall with a  Lucky grocery store, Ross, several eateries, Post Office,...  Best of all  UCSF Family practice is there with a new UCSF Xray/Blood draw/MRI... facility opened next door.  More convenient than  the Parnassus or Mission Bay locations.  Free & easy parking too!</review>

<review>Too difficult to get to, unless you're driving an automobile, to haul your shopping. Not very practical for bicyclists, other than for light shopping.
Also there are much too many commuters parking on the lot, but not shopping - because they are at work.</review>< pictures>

All kind of stores and restaurants are here. From Lucky, to Ross Big 5 just to name a few. If you leave nearby, it will save you a lot of time you otherwise need to get shipping from this remote part of the city.<//Text>

<Review>We ate lunch at The Boulevard. Lousy parking as there is a huge apt. complex behind the restaurant. But once inside it was lovely. Good seats, good selection. I had pork chops and eggs done just right. Their sandwiches are both traditional and new. The service was excellent. Visit them on John Daly Blvd before the Westlake shopping center.< /Review><gmap_id>0x808f7d9f01fbd9c3:0xeb344f103f8fad40<//gmap_id>< user_id>

Nice neighborhood open air mall with ample parking and a wide variety of stores ranging from Petco on the west to Lucky's on the east side. In between many places of various types including a Chipotle, Ross, US Postal Service station, and a Big 5 among them. There is a large Wells Fargo branch near the entry from Sloat. There is something for everyone. I enjoy the Peet's coffee there when I shop in the nippy mornings. Ross gives a discount to seniors on Tuesday.<//Text>

Yesterday we went in around 2:30.
We ordered food and sat down to eat.
It was a miserable experience because the whole place had a strong disinfectant smell.  The smell got into our clothes and even got into our car.
Plus, there was really loud annoying music on.  I will never eat there again.<//Text>

I've been going here since it was GET's. Mainly go to the Lucky's, but there's a lot of other businesses stuffed into a small footprint. They'd get five stars if they could bring back GET's, but that ain't gonna happen in this day and age.</Review>

<review>If a person is for example going to get a lot of stuff at PETCO, then a lot of stuff at LUCKY, they have to move their car.  These places aren't far apart, but they're separated by a hill, steps, etc.  So, parking there is kind of a pain.<//review><Resp>None<//Resp><userid>115647465649872514256</userid><user_name>Ray Kuryla</user_name></record></dataset><record>

Lakeshore Plaza is a standard open air shopping center with a few particularly good points. Points like: Pete's Coffee, Lucky's grocery store, Noah's Bagels, Ross, UPS Store, Petsmart and Kinko's/FedEx. The coffee at Pete's is always good (as evidenced by the regular patronage of the good officers of the SFPD from Taraval station).</text>

It's s decent sized plaza and has ample parking all the time. I don't come to eat though, but mainly to go Lucys. There are definitely a lot of variety of food and shops around here though such as Chipotle, Peet's, your local post office, Wells Fargo, and many others. The next mall nearby is Stonestown so if you don't find what you need you can always head there.< /text>

<Gmap_id>0x808f7d9f01fbd9c3:0xeb344f103f8fad40</Gmap_id><review>Don't tell everybody- but the ross here is kick-ass! Great selection, well organized, staff is professional, place is clean, esp the restroom, well organized merchandise (how do they do it ?? ) I'm really impressed b/c in other locations, the store is blasted out and seems like a hopeless train wreck of insurmountable disorganization.

HUGE selection of men's clothes. Shoes were decent- at least in my size (12) there was a great selection of some unique shoes I've not seen other Ross' carry. For instance, I found some great Nautica slip on "Vans" style casual mocassin, some killer Nikes that look like ninja assassin running booties, and a pair of hi top Supra brand shoes that retail $110 going for $35. They have a huge selection of back-packs, esp high end ones going for pretty cheap.

Anyhow, you know what I mean when I say it's a good Ross.

Plenty of parking, there's food options, Noah's being the fastest of food options, I think.. And a large Lucky's grocery is there as well.

It's a bit out of the way, but well worth it if you need to hit Big 5 and Ross, for instance, to prep for a trip or some activity.<//review>< user>

It's a good mall with Ross and Lucky as the anchor stores. It has something for everyone like Big 5 Sporting Goods, GNC, Peet's Coffee, Noah's Bagels, Game Stop, Gymboree, Ono Hawaiian BBQ, and others. There is more than enough parking here. The only down side is the out of the way location. There is only the 23 Monterey bus that takes people there.< /review>

It's a small shopping plaza. Highlights are Luckys supermarket,  Ross, Noah Bagels, Chipotle, a post office, Kinkos...There are other small stores and restaurants. Lot can get full but cars move often.<//review>

Love the diversity of stores in an at home neighborhood. Lucky's employees help you with groceries to car. Produce is bountiful and Deli is a plus. Ross Dress for less is in the mall, ucsf family practice, AAA, Big 5, Verizon,Hawaiian bbq, peets, paint store, gym bored for little kids, Noah's, Fed Ex, Petco, Chipotle..all in one location...Spend all day and get your hair done and nails or go to the Vitamin Store. YUYU has great spider rolls....if you are looking for it you will find it..parking is hard at times...so avoid peak hours but there is a drive thru mail box for quick errands :)</Text>
