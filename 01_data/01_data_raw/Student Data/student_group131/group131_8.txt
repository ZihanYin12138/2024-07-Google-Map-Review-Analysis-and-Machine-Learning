I stay at Mariott each time i can, just because they have the best bar for busy business travellers. Beer on tap comes in the best variety of choices, with Racer IPA, Drake's IPA, Sam Adams and more. The personnel there is very cool, always in a good mood and open for a fun talk. The guys never hesitate to recommend a cocktail or any drink. One of them suggested a 'New York Sour' cocktail, and he obviously fully understood my tastes.< /review>

Stop by GumaGumalu if you wish to satisfy your Andhra food cravings. Tried Chicken 65 & Chilli Chicken here, both dishes were packed with many flavors but the distinct heat from chilli was very satisfying. My previous experience here definitely warrants a re-visit.<//text>

Wonderful food with an extremely nice unique variety. We have not experienced the dine-in, but the to-go food was steaming hot and delicious. It was a bit spicier than I personally would like, but the flavors were perfect. I look forward to a possible dine-in experience in the future. Order did take longer than quoted, but it was busy and that's a good sign.<//review>

< Review>
I ordered special chicken biryani here (the person who works there said it is the best biryani). I was so excited as its been a while since I ate biryani and i was very very disappointed after eating it. All i got was white rice with chicken on top. Its very bland. I dont want spicy. And chicken tasted bad. But i want flavorful which it isnt. If thats their best, I dont want to taste any other.<//Review>

<Text>I recently tried their Vijaywada Chicken Biryani. Pick up was easy, restaurant felt clean, cashier was prompt and was wearing mask.

Biryani was good but a little salty, overall taste good. Would recommend the place and will try again.</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x808fc7a739db5ae1:0x6c89f46461635379</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>I ordered Gongura Mutton and Ulavacharu Chicken biryanis. 3 stars to Gongura Mutton, the biryani was semi-dry, the gongura flavor did not dominate and the mutton was slightly overcooked. On the other hand, the Ulavacharu Chicken biryani gets all 5 stars. Delicious all over, taste was perfect blend of Ulavacharu(usually sweetened taste, not this one, which is good) and chicken masala. I have had Veg Dum Biryani before and it was Okay. The pickup service was prompt and on time.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<text>Came around 10 and waited an hour and a half. It was a hot day and we were seated inside which was not great. They don't have AC or fans inside so it got a little uncomfortable inside. I would order takeout next time.

The all American is a great sandwich! Love the cheesy hashbrowns and it makes it more filling. They give out plastic utensils and I found it pretty difficult to cut through the croissant.< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<Review>Horrible experience never received my order. Very rude management who didn't try to solve the problem instead spoke to me arrogantly. Grubhub mentioned restaurant handed the order to wrong driver. Being a fremont local I enjoy their food but customer service is a deal breaker.stating delivery is not their problem is very irresponsible especially during pandemic where people try to avoid contact/dine in.

First experience is during pandemic so not the best way to evaluate. Seems that everything is Ala carte so sort of inconvenient for ordering lunch. Lamb fry was pretty tasty, but would have been nice to have some raita, chutney, rice, etc. No Naan, so had a chapati. Not enough for a meal and pretty pricey for lunch. I'd like to see lunch plate option that includes the basics. I'll try it when it's open for real to sr<//Review>

<Text>The chef of this restaurant should not think that all Indian telugu dished should be extremely spicy that hurts every inch of our body from stomach to small intestine.  The paneer biryani i ordered today was so spicy that i hardly ate 1/4 th of it.

Please ask the spice levels when you take the order.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Firstly got the wrong item..ordered chicken curry but got egg curry.. secondly, and the most dissatisfying part of the order was every item ordered tasted of a lot of green chillies, red chilli powder and black pepper. Over spiced food. Yes the gulab jamuns were good.< /Text>

<text>I was here today for the first time. The authenticity of food is unmatched in the east bay. Definitely try the ‘Gaara Natukodi’ and ‘Dhaba chicken’. And the buttermilk is pure love.</text>< pictures>

I've been coming to this shop for well over a decade. Danny and his staff are some of the most honest and hard working people I have ever come across. A+++ I recommend this place to all my friends and family. Great prices and great service. I came today to replace a tire pressure sensor. Dealer would've  charged me a couple of hundred dollars. Danny took care of it for a great price and in a timely manner.</Text>

<review>The workers were very helpful and accommodating. They provided me with multiple options and helped me decide on the best option for me. Their service was really speedy and professional as they installed my 4 new tires, balanced and aligned my car in less than 20 minutes.</review><UserId.>101605159892497096079</UserId.><Rate>5<//Rate>< Pics>

Tires at a great price. Real cheap tire repair (ex. Nail stuck in the tire) quick and great customer service. I have been coming here since my first car in 2014 and I still drive 30 minutes to get here after I moved out of town.<//Review>

I was across the street at another business when one of the guys said your tire looks dangerously low. I thought great, I have no idea where to go and they suggested Irwindale Tire across the street. I never noticed it before and it's definitely easy to miss, but I arrived and they fixed my tire for $10 super quickly. The guys in the shop were friendly and welcoming even though I interrupted their lunch.</text>

This island is truly live up to its name. Completely isolated from the hustle and bustle of the urban life.
You’ll get to experience the nature, water, breathtaking views of the Bay and best of all completely be able to explore this entire island on foot or on bicycle( highly recommended).
There are campgrounds, ferry would take you to this island. Grab some snacks, bread and treats from the Ferry building and head on an adventure to this island all day long.<//Text>

Love this park! Especially in a cloudy day. It’s easier to hike in this weather because it’s not too hot that way. Half of the trail is not covered by shades. It’s a lovely island.</Review>

<Review>took the ferry (blue&gold fleet)over from San francisco - would recommend getting tics early as they sell out fast (hard to get same day tics). The island is beautiful - great for picnic, hiking, biking, SUP, kayak etc. There is 1 cafe on the island which is pricey - would recommend bringing food in to the island instead.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x808583ecde6e1bd5:0x1962287fefef4462<//gmapID></record>

A quiet getaway from the city just 20 minutes by ferry. You can walk or bike around the island - there’s a perimeter loop going around the island. A couple trails in the backcountry. Some historical sites like the Fort McDowell. The beaches looked divine.<//Text>

Beautiful place, very chilled out. I'd recommend staying for a day and go for a hike around the island. Lots of cyclists, you can do kayaking classes too. There is a tram tour if you are push for time or don't want to walk, but it goes really quickly. You'll get a nice view of San Francisco and Alcatraz island.< /Text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Loved this place! Nice for a day out! You can take the ferry and spend the day at the island. I few things to consider, take food with you and make sure to respect the ferry timings. There is only a cafe at the island that I personally did not try. You can find a lot of picnic tables in the island and the views are great, really pleased with the experience. You might have some deer encounters, respect their space.</Text>< Pictures>

Very cool island! Angel island was apparently the Ellis island of the west and processed/quarantined Asian immigrants. It was also a military base. There’s old abandoned buildings that you can explore everywhere - very eerie and awesome!

We did the ring home that circles the island and it took us about 4 hrs walking at a moderate pace. Ferry is a little pricey (~$20 round trip) but it’s a nice day trip.

There’s also a cute cafe on the island with salads, sandwiches and beers but you could also bring your own picnic.</Text>

<Review>Had a wonderful time hiking around Angel Island with some new friends!  Starting with taking the ferry to gorgeous views and a private secluded beach, there was nothing I didn’t like!  Recommend!  Do use the bathroom before starting the trek ... limited options!</Review><Response>None</Response>< date>

<text>Camping on Angel Island is a must on the bucket list. Take the effort to book a campsite six months in advance. Awesome views of East Bay and SF all around, a surreal escape from the city jungle. A night hike up to MT. Livermore will be rewarded with stars and city lights.<//text>< pics>

Beautiful state park. Great place to hike or bike. Be sure to visit the immigration station. I learned a lot about the Chinese Exclusion Act and how Angel Island, unlike Ellis Island, was not a very welcoming place for Asian immigrants. Very interesting experience.</review>

Wow! What a gem! Loved the island. We rented bikes on the mainland at Pedego Bikes and brought them over on the ferry.

Had a blast riding on the lower loop road. There are non-stop views all over the island. Saw Alcatraz, Golden Gate Bridge, downtown, it was great.

We had no idea about all the military and immigration history here that was fascinating to learn about. Nice signs all over the island in its various sections< /review>

<review>We went there for a day trip. We took a ferry from pier 40. The experience to get there was amazing. After reaching there we just did a small brunch with the sandwiches we brought from the city before. They have many tables and picnic areas. After we did a hike all the way up. We returned around 4. You just need to keep the ferry timings in your mind and schedule. But yes this can be the perfect place for a day out- picnic and hike!< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>We booked a boat tour that included a trip to Alcatraz Island and a trip to Angel Island. A beautiful small island with great nature. We let the little train drive us around the island, that was very relaxing.
If you have a little more time and energy, you can also explore the island by foot.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>Rode the tram around the whole Island. The forest is really pretty and the views at the overlook are fantastic! The tour is a recording but really well done and easy to listen to. We learned a lot about the island and it's history. Even saw some wildlife. The cafe had a nice selection but be prepared to pay a premium for it.</Review></record>

This is one of the best hikes that I have done. The whole journey to the top of the island was amazing with different kind of landscapes. The view from the top was amazing. If you are in the city of SFO for a day or two, I would recommend making this trip and then do something else. If you take a morning ferry you can be back by 3-4 PM. I couldn't take the ferry to alcatraz but I can say for sure that this was more fun.<//review>

<text>I went for a hike with office colleagues. It was fun. we started at around 10 am from San Francisco Ferry to Angels Island and the returned by 5 pm. We made it till top and spent 2 hours in sun partying. One of our colleague knew where to climb so it was easy to reach and come back on time. Yeah, be careful and wear full clothes so you are safe from any bug bites and thorny bushy on the trail.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8V89zgjFCW5NjBPBfDYKUtt3Yz3DzFmIjJE4-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmQ5-xWTZ_Rszoc-7MgmwhxH4LOVBUU6X5VxQQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSrSG4EMDy9QSOoXml7Zs94DNHGG0Zvnrlc9SP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808583ecde6e1bd5:0x1962287fefef4462<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Had a camp site on the East Bay site #3 for the night. Highly recommend. More protection from the ocean wind and great views of East Bay and part of downtown SF. There is a faint beep from a buoy on that side but you come to ignore it after a while. Lots of deer, turkey vultures, red tailed hawks, and the occasional raccoon at night. Keep food in the lock box as the raccoons are brave.
The hikes are really easy and surprisingly quick to get around. Mount Livermore is beautiful with 360 degree views. The map is pretty spot on and the park rangers are all super friendly. It's a must for everyone, whether you live in the city or not. Book your campsite 6 months in advance to beat the rush!</Text>< Pictures>

<review>we went to the immigration center and heard an excellend talk and then review of Chinese immigrants in the early 1900s before WW 1; Sad but fascinating, the guide was fantastic. He then took us on a tour. So amazing to see what people have gone through to come here to the US. Well worth it. Then hiked up the island, about 2 miles; gorgeous hike and gorgeous views; Well worth the trip.<//review><time>1568482025619</time><Pics>None</Pics><rating>5< /rating>< gmapID>

Knuckles was there!
They have a rainforest, an underwater city, a garden made of marble, a carnival full of incredibly frustrating barrels, a snowy mountain, a rocket launch site, a hill with nothing but mushrooms, some plane Eggman built, a haunted pyramid, a volcano, a hidden palace in a volcano, some weird place in the middle of the sky, and the Death Egg, but I destroyed that one.</Review>

This is a must stop place if you're wanting a spectacular view!!You can see everything from the Golden Gate Bridge, to the SF skyline,  to treasure island, to Alcatraz, to the Oakland and Berkeley skylines. I don't think. It is well worth the moderate hike up!!<//Text>

Wonderful day trip which includes a short ferry ride from Tiburon to Angel Island.  10K hike around the island.  Great history and beautiful views of the San Francisco Bay.</Review>

Angel Island is a wonderful place to visit.  I recommend taking the earliest ferry available to be one of the first in the island.  Blue and Gold Fleet offers a 9:45am departure that gets you there around 10:15am.  It will take about 2 hours to summit Mt. Livermore and return.  On weekdays there is a Ferry that leaves the island at 1:50pm and another at  3:40pm.  The weekend is less ideal with 12:30pm and 4:15pm ferry pick-ups from the island.  It makes perfect sense to stay longer if you’ve brought a lunch or plant to eat at the cantina (seasonally open).  Return ferries also take a bit longer (usually) as they often stop in Tiburon and Sausalito.  Bring a bike to Angel Island is a great way to squeeze in a visit to the entire island if you plan to make it a single day trip.  They also let bikes board the ferry first, so you’ll have your pick of the best seating!  The island itself is breathtaking and has quite possibly the best views of the bay that are possible from land.</Text>

<text>Angel Island is an island in San Francisco Bay offering expansive 360° views of the San Francisco skyline, the Marin County Headlands and Mount Tamalpais. The entire island is included within Angel Island State Park and is administered by California State Parks. The island, a California Historical Landmark,[1] has been used for a variety of purposes, including military forts, a US Public Health Service Quarantine Station, and a US Bureau of Immigration inspection and detention facility. The Angel Island Immigration Station on the northeast corner of the island, where officials detained, inspected, and examined approximately one million immigrants, has been designated a National Historic Landmark.Angel Island is the second largest island in area of the San Francisco Bay (Alameda is the largest). The island is so large that on a clear day, Sonoma and Napa can be seen from the north side of the island; San Jose can be seen from the south side of the island. The highest point on the island, almost exactly at its center, is Mount Caroline Livermore, more commonly known as simply Mt Livermore, at a height of 788 feet (240 m). The island is almost entirely in the city of Tiburon, in Marin County, although, there is a small sliver (0.7%) at the eastern end of it (Fort McDowell) which extends into the territory of the City and County of San Francisco. The island is separated from the mainland of Marin County by Raccoon Strait, the depth of the water approximately 90 feet. The United States Census Bureau reported a land area of 3.107 km² (1.2 sq mi) and a population of 57 people as of the 2000 census<//text>< Time>

<review>The island was beautiful. The trails were great and clearly marked. The staff on the island was nice. Even living in Berkeley, the trip over was relatively easy. Just make sure to get tickets early for the ferry, because they sell out. The only thing I would "complain" about is that no dogs are allowed on the island, but it is understandable because the ecology of islands are so fragile. Plus, who wants to step in dog poop everywhere, which we all know would be an issue if they let dogs.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Beautiful island, very undervalued: in maximum 2 and a half hours it is covered all along the perimeter road on foot, stopping also at the various batteries, forts, abandoned buildings, all immersed in nature and with the perfect view over the whole bay and the skyline of San Francisco.
Be careful because there is only one bar, and it is located at the ferry terminal

(Original)
Bellissima isola, molto sottovalutata: in massimo 2 ore e 30 la si percorre tutta sulla strada perimetrale a piedi, fermandosi anche alle varie batterie, fortini, edifici abbandonati, il tutto immerso nella natura e con la vista perfetta su tutta la baia e sullo skyline di San Francisco.
Attenzione perché c'è un unico bar, e si trova al terminal traghetti<//Review><Name>Stefano Soave< /Name><time>1566347134448< /time>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) It is a good island to stay for a day on a kayak, but it is very cold and windy at night and not suitable for long stays.

카약을 타고 하루동안 머물기에는 좋은섬이지만, 밤에는 무척춥고 바람이 불어서 오래 머물기에는 부적합한곳.< /text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>Outstanding team at Golden Wrench. We are new to the Vista area and called around several places to find our new mechanic. They had the most competitive prices by far and they are very honest. I love the family feel to the business- Mike the owner takes a huge pride in his company- and for good reason. I appreciated that they had a complimentary shuttle to get me home and back to pick up. Really happy with our first visit. My husband is taking his car in next. They have won our business.< /review>< pictures>

My last visit, they found that the repairs Firestone said I needed were not what was required to fix my problem and that in fact, were not even necessary, saving me over $500.<//Text>< pics>

What I really appreciated was the list Jason provided that spelled out what I really needed immediately and what could wait and approximately how long. It’s extremely hard to find an honest and good mechanic especially if you’re a woman.

< Review>
I was referred here by Discount Tires, they highly recommended them. This is after a long line of horrible experiences from other shops. I came in with a miss diagnosis from another shop and ended up with my car finally right. Thank you Jason, you are amazing! You really know your stuff! Great place, honest and reasonable. Can't wait to get my other car in to see you!< /Review>

I had to have a wheel bearing replaced on my car in which the work was done here. They promptly ordered the part, helped me get set up with a rental and I was back within the day to pick it up. Great experience overall.<//text>

I just want to say that I had a really nice experience coming here. Mike, the owner, was so informative and has been very helpful with my car troubles. My car actually had to go for a much larger repair at the dealership and he has still been helping me through the process despite my car not being with him any longer! Since moving to this area I plan on using Golden Wrench for all my maintenance services.< /review>

I had a 10 a. m. Appointment with Mike Allenstein the owner of the Golden Wrench Automotive Shop on Thursday, December 17, 2020 for a Free Oil Leak Inspection on my 1995 Honda Civic DX Coupe Car.
This Fluid Leak Inspection results finds the Oil Seepage at the Rear of the Oil Pan. I recently had a Oil Pan Gasket Replacement Service done at another Shop. That Gasket Repair looks good. Mike Allenstein the owner said the Oil Leak maybe coming from the rear main engine oil seal.
One of the mechanic’s cleaned the Oil Leak Residue as best as possible. Then a Leak Detection Dye was added to this Crankcase and the customer (me) was required by Mike Allenstein the owner to return in (2 weeks) for Free re-inspection of this Oil Leak finds a Minor Oil Seepage from some threaded oil pan studs.
There was no Gasket Leak.
Mike Allenstein the owner wanted to (save me a lot of money) and he explained to me to drive over to the Autozone Automotive Parts Store and buy 1 Plastic Oil Pan to place underneath my 1995 Honda Civic DX Coupe Car to catch any small oil drips that will drop down into this oil pan. Also Autozone will recycle this oil I bring into their store.
I wasn’t charged a bill (Twice) when I had (2 different Appointments) with Mike Allenstein the owner because Mike told me he gives all of his new customers and his loyal customers Free Oil Leak Inspections and Free Advice to all of his customers.
I told Mike Allenstein the owner of his Golden Wrench Automotive Shop that it’s wonderful for me to receive two Free Oil Leak Inspections and it has saved me a lot of money. I also received (Excellent Customer Service) from Mike Allenstein. Mike was also very thorough in explaining to me and showing me the Oil Leak Issue on my 1995 Honda Civic DX Coupe Car.<//Review>

< Review>
I called the Golden Wrench Automotive Shop on
September 18, 2020 about their Smog Check Price.
I talked to Mike Allenstein the owner, Mike was very personable and very helpful in providing me with the necessary information about their smog check.

Mike spent 25 minutes talking to me on the phone and I really appreciated him taking his time to explain the smog check process to me.
I asked Mike “What makes his Shop stand out among his competitors?  Mike said he gives his Loyal customers, Outstanding Customer Service and even his new customers. Mike told me he tells
his loyal customers every time that he appreciates their business and he shows his customers this by
giving his customers (discounts) on their specific car repair services.

I really enjoyed talking to Mike Allenstein that day because he has been in the automotive repair business for (39 years). Mike also gives Free Advice to his customers and he doesn’t charge them. I think this is a nice feature to their shop because people will save money.

Also this Golden Wrench Automotive Shop offers their customers a (Free Shuttle Service). I spoke to Kari she drives the shuttle. Kari was really nice and she answered all my questions efficiently.

Finally, I also talked to Jason the Service Manager at this shop by phone and Jason was very honest with me. Jason told me he would only charge me $40.00 to complete a smog check on my 1995 Honda Civic DX Coupe Car. Jason said it’s their shop’s way of advertising to bring in new customers so they can sell their Automotive Shop Services. I appreciated Jason being very Honest with me. Jason has great work ethics and he has integrity.<//Review>

Overall great experience. They took me in right away without appointment. I was referred by tire shop. They fixed a broken wheel stud and went extra mile to examine all 4 wheels. Very satisfied with my first visit will definitely come back.< /text>

<Review>This shop is great. Been looking for a new place to take all my cars after bad experiences with other shops. Jason was great, professional and helpful. He replaced two broken wheel studs for free out of good faith. I will definitely be coming back and recommending to friends.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<review>Where do I start? I've only been a 100% repeat customer for 25 years. In fact, I just got my Chrysler 300C back from a BIG job...a new engine. In August, I took it in because it was intermittently stalling after refueling with a full tank of gas. The next thing I know I get a call telling me THEY are taking it to the Chrysler dealership. Turns out, whatever the problem was (hey, I'm mechanically challenged) Chrysler had extended the warranty to lifetime (NOT a recall), a new fuel tank, and whatever goes with that, was installed  and I paid nothing - at the dealership OR Golden Wrench. Don't know that would be the outcome had I taken it elsewhere.I trust Mike and Jason 100%, 100% of the time! Guys, I think it's time you change your name to PLATINUM WRENCH AUTOMOTIVE. Honestly don't know what I'd do without my automotive "family".<//review>< Pictures>

It's pretty cute and cozy park. There are plenty benches and there two covered gazebos with tables. I love the ambience here, very romantic. Unfortunately, there's no parking and there is no fence to ensure the kids safety. There is a vast green open space to run after your kid if they decide to run towards the street, but I must say it's nerve wracking that the park is built right on a main street  with lots of traffic. I wish it would have a fence. Other than that, beautiful.</review>

Cross between a typical corner grocery store and Chinese food specialty shop. Convenient, interesting. Discovered too late that a couple of items were past their expiration dates. Ignoring that the prices were quite reasonable.<//Review>

Great service everytime we've been there. The coffee could be the whole reason to go there, but the food is great too. I recommend going for sure!< /Review>

<text>Great late dinner after being on the road.  I ordered the carne asada breakfast, substituting chicken easily.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, hash browns were nicely crispy on the outside, and the pico de gallo so tasty!  The owner was incredibly nice.  Cute, quaint, yummy and dog friendly!</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzK3BlciBI0AK88yKczWBloK7qzJeA65YipL0O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x54d27a35ad47015b:0xfe2f7ecd4590fb< /gmapID></record>

Not much in the way of food for vegans. Had a plain salad and was hungry soon after. Coffee was just so - so</Review>

Friendly personalities, great service, clean n' tidy bathroom!

Pancakes pass the "floof" factor
Tri-tip seasoned well, cooked nice and tender
Eggs cooked real even like
Taters were as Samwise Gamgee stated "Lovely big golden chips"

To top it all off their fluffy mascot is half dog and half bear, and loves pets and attention 🐕

10 out 10 would recommend!<//text>

Now they serve freshly made pizzas! I ordered a large combo today and it was awesome! Great little local place for coffee,  breakfast, or lunch. Easy to find, right off the highway at the Antlers Road exit.  Had the breakfast burrito,  big portion, good value.< /text>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>We stopped in during the off-season yet Bruce and Luis were in peak form. We came for the coffee, and stayed for the breakfast burritos. It’s details like creamer kept on ice, carefully curated retro decor, and a cozy fireplace that’ll keep me coming back next time I’m headed through Lakehead. Grab a sweet business card while you’re there, you’ll be glad you did.</review><resp>None< /resp><user_id>115210255500455658382</user_id><Rating>5</Rating><user_name>Sidney Field<//user_name><Date>1514749996457< /Date></record></dataset><record>

Dropped off packages two times and received courteous and efficient service.  Both were Amazon returns and one time out of ink so couldn’t print scan code so I wrote down ups tracking and read it to service person and they typed in to print Amazon label.  Awesome service not sure why others are complaining.< /text>

<user>106843067186349333516< /user><Review>I normally don't leave reviews, but this place is terrible.

They charged my mom $2.25 to print 1 black and white page on their self service printer. That is an unreasonable and predatory price, especially since they only told her it was that much when she went to pay.

I would not recommend this place to anyone. This level of markup indicates a lack of care for customers that borders on price gouging.</Review></record>

The Chinese guy that works there was so very rude! I'm no expert with phones. Ive only printed one other time. And this guy ignored my questions and right when I asked him something, a new customer came in and he asked if he could help him. I walked out!! The ups in Lkwd is so much better. Friendly and helpful!  This guy shouldn't work w/ people!< /review>

It's the worst of all the stores I've ever visited.  I asked because the package I sent here had a problem, but he didn't even check it on the computer and says right away couldn't check it here.  The opinions of the review never lie!!</Text>

< Review>
I went to this South Street UPS store for notarization service today, the owner/worker there, is a very polite and friendly India young  man. I was told that they just took over the business  2 weeks ago in  2/2020. The previous owner was very rude, but this new owner is very nice to work with. I highly recommend this UPS store!!! The notarization fee is  $15 per signature, which is the lowest fee you pay  in California too.< /Review>

Extremely rude old guy - probably the owner - INCOMPETENT!!! Needed to send a document overseas and they messed up. Even when I asked for customs forms they said this envelope is all you need to fill out. I shipped on Dec 29th and was supposed to deliver in 3 days and today is Jan 1st and it is Still stuck in Louisville, KY for missing  customs form.

UPS headquarters should take a note of this branch with 75  1.5 star rating. These guys are bringing down UPS name< /text>

My husband has always said the owner is rude and nasty.    But, his son was in the store and I thought he could help me with some amazon returns.  I dont know who was worse,  the son or the father. EXTREMELY RUDE AND UNHELPFUL!  They need to read their reviews.   I’m so tired of these apathetic sprayed insects we have to deal with in business.  If life is so bad, go play with computers In your mothers basement!</text>

Came in to make simple copies of my documents. The old man didnt ask if i needed any assistance, just walk up to the printer i was using and started moving the settings. His gesture was rude and made it seem as thought he thought i was going to damage his printer. The other guy behind the cashier didnt even know how to use the printer. I asked him for help on making some copies, comes up to the printer, opens the copier and then just walks away back behind the cashier. I got my things and payed for some copies i had made myself.

EXTREMELY RUDE customer service.  I cant say for the younger man working there because he wasn't the one that helped me but it was an older asian man.  He was extremely rude and did not speak English well.  I am half asian myself so I do not mean this in a bad way but why work at a job that you NEED to speak English if you cannot do it well, are rude to customers, and are representing UPS in a very bad way?   Extremely upset.  UPS needs to do something about this before I never use their service again.</Text>

<review>Don't ever use UPS, their services are straight trash and I don't understand how they are still in business . Their tracking system was horrible in my experience being that it was only updated twice and its been over a week, the dates on the tracking of the item was also wrong. UPS claimed they had my tablet in January when I actually had it. I sent my package out with FedEx and it arrived in 4 days and that was with the delays going on Baltimore because of the riots. UPS has taken over a week in delivering my package with no delays listed, after calling they said I will have to wait till Monday since their is no deliveries on weekend which I believe is bullshit also. Unfortunately my warranty provider uses shitty mail service and I also will calling them to make my complaints.< /review>< pics>

<review>First the ups customer service sends you to a different address 13233 moore st cerritos, then Google maps gives you this address then they said they are open from 8 to 8:30pm to customers who want to pick up their packages like a special service, then you go and is totally close... finally you decide to call them and they tell you without a worry or a care for your time or gas come back tomorrow or look around and see if there's a security guard there and ask... bad customer service bad directions bad communication they don't have a direct phone number. Hope they close soon and fire those unprofessional people who don't care about others people time and business.< /review>< user_name>

Contrary to the other reviews, the owner was pleasant and laughed with us about me needing glasses to see all the fine print. The service was good. However, an overnight envelope to Nashville Tn. was 48.00 and change - along with the $40.00 Notary charge made sending this envelope sized package a bit costly. My wife uses overnight services frequently and I use Notary signers on a regular basis and tallied up the cost to be more than double the normal amount we are charged for the same service. I was in a hurry and needed this to make it by Monday - So I went with his pricing.
Normal overnight service is 16.00 to 22.00 and Notary signing 15.00. This cost me a few bucks and I hope my package is there by 5:00pm Monday. If not, I will follow with another review.< /Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>The asian owner is very grumpy and provides the worst customer experience possible.  I would highly suggest to take your UPS dropoff ELSEWHERE.  His older son seems very nice, but the younger one is just like his dad..grumpy and crappy service.  Never met a grumpier salesman.  Avoid this place and go to the USPS, right across the bridge on Carmenita/183rd.< /text><UserId.>117088444602560767498</UserId.>< name>

The way this man talks to their customers is like as if we are all criminal scum who are there to steal his money when in fact all customers coming into the store are just trying to pay for their service. Im closing my mailbox today and renting one elsewhere. I hope someone can tell them to read all the negative reviews this store is getting, but he will most likely not even care tbh.<//Review><username>Edward< /username>< user_id>

Wow, it is true with the negative reviews. The person in the store was rude. I will not return to this store but rather drive further out. How do they allow someone like that to do business?< /text>

They print you a receipt when you drop off a package for delivery. Be careful what you ship though, they literally toss the box into a pile, regardless of what your box may contain.<//Text>

The front desk is very helpful; however, when a request got escalated to manager/owner, it becomes a very unpleasant experience - owner is unhelpful, unwilling, and his attitude shows that he thinks customers are troubles.<//review>

This winery is awesome! It has limited seating inside which could be unfortunate. However, the bartender we had was really knowledgeable and had a fun personality. They also have such a wide range of wines, red, rose and white. In addition, to a span of sweet, dry and in between. They also have some unique wines, such as one I had, had some spice to it due to peppers being used in the process. It is a fun atmosphere, would highly recommend :)< /review>

Wandering around I was craving WINE and was delighted to find his place located inside of the Old town (park). PEG was very friendly and knowledgeable. She made wonderful suggestions. All the wines are from the San Diego area which is a delightful change from Napa. They also have beer. I had a flight based on the recommendations of Peg and enjoyed. Great place to sit and unwind and meet people. Would recommend and will be back. Thanks !  They also have lots of trinkets and gifts for the wine/ beer enthusiast!< /review>

My boyfriend and I went to Rose's on a whim and were so pleasantly surprised! They offer a great selection of wine and the staff are super knowledgeable. Both staff members were welcoming, friendly, and happily spent quite a bit of time talking to us about all things wine. We learned a lot and tried some great wines, overall such a nice experience!< /Text>

I really love the wine here. And the environment. And the bartenders were very nice. I hardly ever write anything negative on yelp reviews unless I feel like a restaurant could be better from the feedback. I ordered a cheese plate, two cheeses and salami. The portions were so tiny you would think the cheese was being rationed and salami going extinct. The whole cheese plate felt sad, felt ungenerous and cheap. I really encourage the owners to figure out  a way to create a cheese plate that feels plentiful. I understand this isn't Switzerland, or France, but you can do better. Check out Fig in Santa Monica for the way it should be done.<//text>

Joe and Colm were absolutely professional and so amazing!! Super knowledgeable about varius wines. I'm new to wines, and have had this misunderstanding that to understand wine you must be "bougie". Not true at all. Joe has a degree in knowledge of wine, and from what i learned first hand experience, it's not about the price or color, but your palate and what suits the individual. They educated me on various wines, their history and origin. I felt like i was at wine school, but in a fun and safe learning environment. Please, come spend your hsrd earned dollars and valuable time at Rose's Tasting Room, for a most sophisticated yet laid back experience!! You will leave impressed and refreshed, with a wine blush. Amazing products and service!! This is what separates average to exceptional business. Thank you again, Joe and Colm!! From a Midwestern's truest heart, this place is A MUST!!!< /review>

I have been coming here for about 5 years and everytime tops that last. Great service, its one of the best parts really. Its a smaller place with a lot of nick nacks to look at and keep you entertained (ive bought some). Love their options there are always local things to try and very reasonable price. I will continue to go<//review>

<review>My wife and I started coming here in late May and loved the place so much that we have come back almost every single week since, sometimes twice a week!

The wine and beer are both good, all local San Diego county breweries and wineries. But the best part, the guys pouring the drinks. We were introduced to the bartender, Joe, on our first visit. He was so awesome that we knew we had to keep coming back. His knowledge of wine is second to none. He is a professionally trained sommelier and oh man does he know his stuff. I have learned more about wine than I ever thought possible. He has such a great passion for what he does and it really shows. A few months later we were introduced to Colton, another great personality and fun person to be around. Between the two of them there is no place we'd rather be or people we'd rather be around on a Saturday night.

I think it's safe to say that if you are looking for a great place to have a drink and a good conversation, this is the place to be!<//review><time>1518711772088<//time><Name>Kevin Csupak</Name>< user>

One of the bartenders is a sommalier, and was the most knowledgeable person I've talked to about wine. He knows more than just flavors; the history of wine flows as freely as the nearest Petit Sirah.< /review>

Yes the food was very cheap, but it was so cheap that the quality suffers just a bit. Its a great local spot to fill up and have a cheap breakfast, however nothing was was outstanding, it was all bland. At $5 for a breakfast, I'd try it again. Remember its a CASH Only restaurant.< /text>

This restaurant is absolutely one of the finest place to eat in the neighborhood. Anytime I come there I am remarkably glad. They preserve their high  standard service and the topmost level of food  they serve. You definitely will enjoy this this place. Warmly  recommended.</Review>

<Review>Good food for a very low price. It was well worth more than I paid, so i tipped really big. Two of us ate for less than $7 . If you want a lot of choices this is not the place for you. If you're hungry and on a tight budget, this is definitely the place to go.<//Review><Name>Sue Degraw</Name><GmapID>0x808dfcd164b1bab5:0xa3680a4d0e2b0728</GmapID>< response>

Very awesome place especially with the low prices! Good fast service. A staple in the community. Tommy's is a great place especially when you are on a budget. Can't complain at all.< /Review>

I want to like this place more but they never finish cooking the eggs
A little clear instead of runny
But the place made me feel like home</Text>

<text>If your in the Bay Area. You have to try Tommy’s. Service is fast and you can’t beat 1.49$ “work man breakfast” ask for the fried rice with it.< /text>< pictures>

<review>Tommy's is not your average Mom & Pop breakfast place.  Cost $4.75 for eggs, toast, hash browns, 3 silver dollar pancakes.  Don't expect fancy but, it is fast.  Not a lot of choices but. Very affordable.  No burgers and 3 kinds of sandwiches.  A few sides.  Not fancy, not big, but fast.<//review><response>None<//response><name>zephyer 1999<//name>< user_id>

Its a cute little diner with amazing prices. Ive never seen breakfast for 2-5 dollars a plate. I came here with my boyfriend since hes always been here with his family when he was a kid, so we wanted to bring back the nostalgia. I always get the tommys special with a side of coffee and i love the pancakes. Its just a cute humble diner that i try to come to every weekend ❤<//Text>

Cant beat the price. The service is very fast and friendly. There menu is small but nice. Many customers dont need to see a menu after being there a few times. Would definitely recommend!< /review>

Love their fried rice. Always enjoyed their breakfasts. No nonsense type of place.
Basic , simple and delicious. If you get hungry for good old fashion breakfast with a Chinese touch, you won't be disappointed.</Text>

My husband and I come here every week on our morning off. We can get a delicious and simple breakfast, that we don't have to make ourselves, for about the same price as cooking at home. The owners are so sweet, and the atmosphere is about as down to earth and local as you can get. Highly recommended!!<//Review>

Tommy's is just one of those rare gems that you feel very lucky to stumble upon. The atmosphere is cozy, there's always people, and Judy and Tommy and crew are always nice and happy to be there. The food is ridiculously inexpensive, and whether I'm there by myself or with friends or visiting family, there's something for everyone to eat and nothing is out of budget. Always a good time and good food to be had.<//Text>

What can I say. This is your typical greasy spoon ma and pa restaurant. Nothing fancy, cheap eats. Good little local spot reataurant where you can get eggs, ham, fried rice and pancakes for under $5</text>

This place knows what they are. Cheap, quick, home cooked meals with no frills and nonsense. From San Jose and this place reminds me of a breakfast spot near San Jose State University but at an even more affordable price for their meals. A nice spot to stop by on your way to Monterey or Pismo.<//text>

Super cheap, down home, substitute fried rice for hash browns, easy to chit chat with neighbors. ((Wishbacon, makes you wish you had real bacon. 😜))<//text>

Service was amazing and fast. I highly recommend coming to these guys to fix your phone. I liked that after my phone was fixed they made sure everything worked. I'm honestly so happy with the service they provide. I definitely will be coming back whenever I need to fix my phone or my kids phones.<//review>

Sam helped my brother with his cracked phone. My brother cracked the front and back of his IphoneX (first generation). As soon as we walked in we did not have to wait more than 2 minutes when Sam greeted us and assisted us. Sam was very helpful and friendly. And May I add very knowledgeable. Not only is the service outstanding but the prices are unbeatable. We ended up paying half the other places. If you guys are in the area don’t get fooled by the vendors outside in the same mall go to “The Fix” on the second floor of the Northridge mall and ask for Sam to help you!!!< /text>

< Review>
The best place I have been to. The clerk is very nice and does a great job. I had my XR broken front and back and they left it like new. Much affordable than Apple Store and other competitors. They also threw in some freebies which makes them even better. I am very pleased No Wonder They Have 5 Stars with hundreds of reviews. Keep up the good work!! People remember and come back. I will recommend you to 10 people more.< /Review>

<text>Went in early on a Saturday with a baby and a cracked screen on my 6S plus. J was straightforward in the way he explained his work and so fast in making the repairs. I went here because of the great Google reviews and J deserves them. Came out with a new screen and case, 100% satisfied!</text>< rating>

I went to "the fix", to fix my phone screen, I told them that I want the fingerprint working on my phone and they told me that is gonna be an original Samsung screen replacement,  the phone work for two weeks.
When I went to the store to talk with the manager he told me that they install a refurbished aftermarket screen, so they never  told me that, I DON'T RECOMEND THIS PLACE< /text>

I went to Sam to get my cracked screen fix on my iPhone 6s+ this morning & I couldn't be happier. I went to a few places to get the estimate and by far Sam got the most affordable rate. It was a bonus since my brother been to him before.<//Review>

<pics>None</pics><review>My husband came in to fix his iPhone 8 front and back screen. After coming in and fixing the screen the camera messed up, speaker wasn’t working , and it wasn’t touching properly. Had to come in again and same issues. Decided to order original - not their after market screen - and they couldn’t install it so we had to come in again. In the end we came in a total of 6 times the screen is still not the original Apple screen , the True Tone doesn’t work, the front view camera is blurry  and the viewing angles are not up to par with the original Apple screen.</review>< user_id>

<Text>A great experience I had today when I walked in the store . There were a nice lady that greated me from the entrance . I was totally amazed by the choice that i had. They have hundreds of nice cases and accessories. I got my phone fixed in 20 minutes and I got a good discount for a case a tempered glass protector . Also they gonna give 10 % off for the accessories next time . This is definitely best experience since I got my iPhone . I'll come again , I'll buy more .

My iPhone 7 screen got cracked and I had a third party fix it and my phone kept restarting. I brought my phone to Best Buy since Geek Squad is authorized to fix iPhones from Apple. I brought my phone in and the guy told me I might need a system restore so I handed my phone over. If the restore didn't work I would have to replace it for $319. An hour later I got a phone call saying my battery was punctured and there was leakage and Apple will no longer accept my phone and I will have to pay a fee of $600+ to replace it!!!!!<//text>

For iPhone users who need battery/screen/and so much more, THE FIX is the place!  The owner answers the phone even before they open.  The employees are kind, not aggressive and the work is warranted and costs much less than you know who/where would charge.  Please do yourself a favor and check them out...you’ll be SO happy you did!< /text>

My daughter had dropped my phone and completely shattered my screen to where glass had chipped off. I had went to a few other places including UbreakIfix and they were going to charge $90 that’s if nothing else was wrong with the phone so I finally called The Fix and they only charged $59 I couldn’t beat that deal. Arrived and store was super clean and well stocked with cases and accessories. Was greeted right away by Sam. He was very nice to my husband and I. Service only took 20 min and on top of that inspected phone to make sure everything was working. They offer great deals there if you break your phone on a regular and really motivate you with perks to keep you coming back. Will use this place again and will refer for sure!</review>

<text>Miranda was so nice.  I bought a case that I loved, but it was too bulky for my hand so I returned it the next day.  She was very nice when she greeted me and she helped me find the right case that met my really silly needs.  She was so patient was helping me try on different cases for my phone.

We stopped by this shop to check the prices and all and to my surprise they charge hella less compared to the others we had inquired. I got it fixed in minutes and its like new again! The employees are very helpful and i am more than satisfied with the work done.
5 stars and more to you guys!
P.s readers, buy yourself a screen protector too. They charge less and might give a warranty too.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUY39XYMbU89BxAet9IUoXS2e1ebshgKYs1z53=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

<text>Was told it would take an hour for my galaxy 9 plus to have the charging port replaced. It took them 3 hours. They kept messing up the seal on my phone. Leaving a gap that was big enough for me to put my nail in which means my phone is no longer water proof. They said it was because of the glue. They tried 3 times to fix it. I finally said fine and left only to find then had that my sim card wasn't in my phone. They put my sim card in and the sim card slot didn't work. They had to take my phone apart again to fix the sim card slot. Do not go to this place ever.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

The Fix Phone repair inside the Northridge mall has the best phone screen repair prices in Northridge. I was on vacation and I went to the Northridge mall and I saw the store located in the second floor and I asked the price to repair my ixr , the price was really cheap! They fixed it in less than 30 minutes and Nicole (an employee) was very helpful putting on a glass screen protector for me! I’m leaving satisfied and with a new phone screen. :)< /review>

<Text>First I went to uBreak iFix and they wanted nearly $300 to rebuild my Samsung S9 to fix a stuck volume button. They said they had to basically restore it to like new, which included replacing the screen.

I then found The Fix. Sam was great and within an hour my button was fixed without a complete rebuild of the phone. Including the protective case I purchased,  I was out the door for about $125.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1579883023848, 'text': 'Hellow ,Thanks for taking time to review us ,Next time when you need a screen repair or iPhone Fix Northridge we are more than happy to help you We are professional iphone repair shop that specialize in repair service Apple repair tablet repair and any smartphone repair store .

I dropped my friends LG g4 phone while playing a prank, and he had no screen protector on so the screen cracked big time (as you see in the picture). We stopped by this shop to check the prices and all and to my surprise they charge hella less compared to the others we had inquired. I got it fixed in minutes and its like new again! The employees are very helpful and i am more than satisfied with the work done.
5 stars and more to you guys!
P.s readers, buy yourself a screen protector too. They charge less and might give a warranty too.< /Text>

<Text>By far one of my favorite places for phone repairs and accessories! The staff here is really professional and friendly, and also has a great knowledge about phone repairs and the accessories they sell. One of the staff members which her name is Briana has been such a big help every time I come in and is also super friendly! Would highly recommend this place to anyone!<//Text>< Name>

Girl who placed my screen protector was rude and didn't place correctly so had to drive back 😒 to get it replaced spoke with Jorge he was kind and replaced free of charge otherwise would have been charged  Installation fee.< /review>

I dropped my phone while at work and decided to check this place out. The Fix really caught my attention in the Northridge Fashion Center because it was so bright and clean. The clerk George was very helpful and fixed my phone within the hour for a reasonable price. I also decided to get a case from them to protect my phone. Very pleased with the experience. Absolutely will be coming to them if my phone breaks.</review>

I Got my iPhone 6S fixed in less than 15 min . The guy that fixed is awesome. Nice service , nice store , high class professionalism. I got a deal for a new case , and a glass screen protector with lifetime warranty replacement, for only 5 $ every time . That's gonna be my store for future shopping.< /Text>

<Review>First off I have to say their customer serives is awesome. I was shown much needed kindness and generosity by Bleu and George. For my phone died and I was in a city I did not know very much about, I didn't know how to get home. Long story short I had a very hard day and found my way to their store. And they helped me out in charging my phone. They were all very patient with me and other customers. As I waited there I saw them attending their customers with such attentiveness. From over hearing a woman that was basically the middle woman in her situation. Taking her husband's phone in for repairs. She was not having a very good day from the sounds of it and George was very patient with her as well. Not that she was out of line or anything but she just wanted to get home as well. But as I stood there I was able to realize they fix phones, computers, and tablet. And even hover boards from over hearing a conversation. They have so many accessories for your phone and much more. So even though I wasn't there to buy anything or a repair. I was able to witness their service skills and I was very pleased to have met Bleu, George, and Alex as well. They are the guys to see, they will help you anyway they can. Thank you for your time and your kindness guys. I will never forget it.</Review><user>116917336745646626095< /user><rating>5< /rating>< date>

The Fix replaced an IPad screen for me, it was fast and convenient. I was hoping it wasn’t going to be to expensive, and it was pricy but much cheaper than their competition. The replacement looks great and it working perfectly.< /Review>

Had a broken case that was falling apart and did not want one until Briana educated me on getting a nice blue one that I really enjoy today and Im happy I made a decision and listened to Briana and made a purchase and I love The case if you want a good experience with the Fix go to Briana she will make you laugh, very nice and will give you an excellent service if I need a new case or know anyone that needs a case I will definitely make them come to The Fix and tell them to ask for the one and only Briana.</Review>

<Review>I love Justin Bieber so much and it’s hard finding a case for him. Thank god I came across the fix as I was shopping in the Northridge mall! It only took them 5 minutes to make my customized Justin Bieber case. I definitely recommend them to anyone who’s creative and wants to express themselves.< /Review>< pics>

I had some problems with my phone . I've been charging the phone 100 % , but it last only for 2 hours . The guys from this store offered me a free diagnostics, and in less than 15 minutes i got a new battery replaced . Now i can spend more time on social networks :)) .
Because i changed the batterie i got 10 % off , for this termo case . Love this store. 5 stars from me .< /Text>

This a great place to get a phone fixed. I took in my Sony Xperia Z3 that I haven't used in about a year because of the shattered screen/digitizer. I left a deposit so they could order the part. Once it was there they called me and fixed it within 2 hours. Now it's as good as new. This will be my to go place to fix any broken screen on a phone.<//review>

<Review>Thank you The Fix . Two days ago I got a quote from somebody in Van Nuys to fix my iPhone 6 S for 89 $ . Then I walk in this beautiful bright store that is right next to forever 21 second floor Northridge fashion center .
So for this price I got my phone fixed , I got a screen protector , and the life time warranty on it . I thought is gonna take a day , but those guys solve my problem in just 20 min . Nice , Clean  store , and friendly workers. 5 stars from me guys. Thank you .< /Review>< resp>

This place is awesome . I was worried for how much an iphone 7 screen cost to be replaced, i went to the fix store , i got the quote , and not only the quote. In less than 30 minutes my phone was fixed for a good price , plus i got the screen protector with a life time warranty on it . Great customer service . 5 stars for those employees.</Text>

<Text>My iphone was broken and I repaired it at northridge mall at down stair at some kiosk later in a week I found it cripmy and I see the screen cracked out the again I went  back to mall and someother person was there at the place he told me to come next time for the same person  I got very  angry , while leaving from the mall I found THE FIX store I thought to give it a shot and ask  about prices went inside I found the person over there gentle and I told them about what all happend with me in that , there's one guy told , I think his name is GEORGHE very nice and polite guy and he told he can fix  in 30 mins but actually he fixed in 20 mins plus he charged so less. Amazing guy great quality of work.  usually I wont give review but for a guy like this  and work like this,  he deserves a. Shout out. Must go for it if you  have any sort of phone issues and amazing varites of phone covers too.< /Text>< time>

(Translated by Google) I went to change the screen on my iPhone 11 phone they told me the price $ 169 they never told me it was a false screen I realized when I couldn't use Face ID afterwards and then the screen didn't have much touch I also got dark the screen for a long time and didn't turn on the phone I went where they changed the screen they did but I realized for themselves that the screens are non-original screens. I do not recommend this place because I honestly think that from the beginning as a customer they would have told me the product they were selling me more, however they did not, I found out in the Apple store and the screen costs $ 200 and it is original so I think it is better not come to this place where nothing else will ruin your phone

(Original)
Fui a cambiarle la pantalla a mi teléfono iPhone 11 me dijeron el precio $169 nunca me dijeron que era una pantalla falsa yo me di cuenta cuando ya después no podía usar el Face ID y luego la pantalla no tenía mucho tacto también se me quedaba oscura la pantalla por un largo tiempo y no encendía el teléfono fui donde ellos a que me cambiaron la pantalla lo hicieron pero me di cuenta por ellos mismos que las pantallas son pantallas no originales. Yo no recomiendo este lugar porque sinceramente pienso que desde el principio como cliente me hubieran dicho el producto que me estaban vendiendo mas sin embargo no lo hicieron averigüé en la tienda de Apple y la pantalla cuesta $200 y es original entonces yo pienso que es mejor no venir a este lugar donde nada más te van a arruinar el teléfono< /Review>
