The receptionist took 3 clients before me, that arrived after me. They tried to double charge me for the medicine. The antibiotic were warm when they are supposed to be refrigerated! They then charged me $35.00 extra per kitten because the doctor said my kittens were in heat, when I know for FACT that they were NOT in heat! Had to wait another hour to pick them up and once again the receptionist's took  4 people that arrived after me. Then the icing on the cake.... my kittens came home with FLEAS!!!  Don't waist your time with the frustration this place offers! I gave them 1 star for the only positive... My kittens were alive when I went to get them!!!< /Review><Resp>None</Resp>< name>

Our pitbull puppy has been in 4-5 Times in his short 5 months (in addition to his puppy immunizations). From the very beginning (and hopefully till the very end), I will take him to Tricity Vet. He is known by all the employees (by name, as we walk in the door) and treated as family to them all. Even for pets who may not come as often, they receive the same treatment. It is always clean and orderly. I would especially like to mention Dr.Bhillar, whose HUGE heart as a vet and pet owner, and animal lover, has made our, and Groots world, possibly and enjoyable. These people really, really care.<//text>

I went in today with two of my cats. An employee named “Priash” helped me out with the check out. i pointed it out to him that he got my name wrong on the paper and gave him my id to correct the name. He didn’t bother to apologize or understand and told me that he will print the new paper for me after correcting the name. Instead of printing out a new paper with the right name he left and another employee started helping me. He didn’t pass down my info to the new employee and i had to tell her all over again that they got my name wrong. Tricity should employee better people on the front desk. The people who don’t catch an attitude if someone only wants their name right on the paper.</Text>

<review>Remember those days at the doctor's office? When you made an appointment, you waited 15 mins outside and then they put you in a small room.  You wait another 30 mins for the doctor to show up?  That's what they do. 30 mins after the apptmt I still didn't talk to a vet.

Wouldn't even come back after my dogs surgery if I wasn't flying today. This place is terrible. Don't believe the fake reviews that say this place is great.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcm0g80IM3EJjQa0zes6LMWXJu22xTMJb8xqvR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

So, I'm reading comments about this place and I have to let any other person who reads the comments know that there isnt a dr. Raj nor a doctor salaam nor a doctor wise at tri-city vet. They are leaving reviews for other vet offices. Now, if you are trying to read comments on tri-city vet then here is a reliable one. I have been coming here for years and yes it has its ups and downs but the prices are great and the vets are so caring and thorough. Sebastian the tech is amazing. All new staff up front that are doing a better job then last batch of employees. They have saved my cats lives on multiple occasions and helped us through some very tough times. Dr. Salwan is great and dr.buhlar is amazing as well. You may experience  a few days of not getting a call back right away with test results but if you keep calling or go in you will get a dr on the phone or in person to explain results. They dont push services on you they only reccomend and they listen to you. I wouldnt change my vet for anything. They are like family. I highly recommend this place. Just remember, they are super busy and do their best to get you as soon as they can. They are also great with surgeries and follow ups.<//text>

<Text>Took in a cat who had escaped and come back. He was very skinny. Got an appointment in 48h. Now I know why. Very slow once there, put him on IV so they could draw blood for tests. We were told we'd get test results within 2-3 days. It's been TWO WEEKS. I've now called 4 times. Every single time: the doctor is at lunch (no matter what time of day it is), hold for 20min, say they're going to call you back. They don't call back. On 4th call I asked to get the test results by voicemail. I haven't gotten them. We're about to take them to small claims court. This is fraud, to say you're doing to take money for test results and never deliver them. Don't waste your money.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Murdered my rabbit after I brought her in for a routine check up. Encouraged me to get her a blood test and they put her under and she died. They refused to tell me why she died after multiple attempts of calls and trying to book an appointment with Dr. Salaam (the doctor that killed her). When I was able to book because the receptionist didn't know who I was and when I came in they threatened to call the police and throw my handicapped aunt out.

After this happened and I posted my story on FB and Yelp and so many people reached out saying a similar thing happened to their pets here.

Please keep your pets safe and DONT GO HERE. They may not make it out alive.</Text>

DO NOT GO THIS PLACE if you care about your pets' life. The receptionists there keep lying. For your pets' safety, please do not trust them. I brought the nursing cat mom for 2nd antibiotics shot because she got a flu. When I spoke to receptionists, they said the cat will get FCV/ FeLV vaccine instead of 2nd antibiotics shot. I asked them, "Did you confirm with the doctor since it is unusual to have nursing cat mom vaccinated?" They said they have confirmed with the doctor and I should believe the professionals. One day after, the doctor blamed on me that how come I insisted to have sick cat vaccinated instead of 2nd antibiotic shot. I finally realized that the people at front desk NEVER confirm with doctors but lie to me that they confirm everything with doctors. In the meantime, they lie to doctor that I insist to have the cat mom vaccinated. I am so worry about the cat if she will get worse and worse due to reckless people at front desk.<//review>

The tall lady on front desk who seems to be supervisory in role was the one and extremely rude. When I said I do not want to get work done if coupon not honored, she said she does not care. Very unprofessional. Will never go there ever.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Same thing from the comment below. My cat is sick,  she was vomiting, coughing, and she had strong pain on her abdomen. So I took her and they put IV and then we did a blood test. I called more then 4 times and they will say "the doctor will call you to give you the results"  and will never call me back. I waited 3 WEEKS to finally get the results. When I was on the phone with the doctor he sound very rush. Didn't really explain well, and just told me there is nothing to worry about. My cat still feeling sick, she hasn't been feeling any better.</text>

<text>Pet care isn't bad but trying to get your pet's medical records is THE WORST! It's taken me over three months to get LuLu's medical records for an insurance claim. Lulu has been re-homed since then, and I still haven't got the medical records! The staff keeps saying, "it's on the doctor's desk," "doctor is on lunch," "doctor is in emergency surgery," "we're waiting on the doctor to sign off," etc. Every other vet she's been to has sent the records the same day. Even the insurance company themselves told me they'd gotten nowhere with this office in trying to get her records.
If you need pet care and you don't have insurance, by all means, go for it. But if you have pet insurance, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! Seriously.< /text>< Pictures>

I have been a client for over a year. I have had very positive experiences with the front desk and Dr. Raj. He went through a very challenging time with my little dog where no other vet could diagnose her weight loss. Dr. Raj put her on some basic food for digestive issues and a light dose of Pepsid AC. Bella began to eat much better and was back to her old self.</Text>

<review>Hello Everyone,
I wanted to share my experience as a new client of the Tricity Veterinary Hospital. I am not going to lie, I was hesitant to go due to the reviews. I took my 7-year old Siberian Husky, Luna, because she was stung by bees. In addition, she developed an infection. I had my appointment at 3:15 and everyone in the office was very nice. They took Luna to the Vet and gave her the injections she needed. The pricing was affordable and I felt very satisfied. My Luna is resting and she felt so comfortable in the vet. We should be back in 7 days for a follow up.</review>< user_name>

We have been coming to this hospital for years and never had problems until now.  We are very disappointed with our service.  We brought our dog in for an exam and also had x-rays done.  We did the x-rays and was told they need to do further ultrasound to determine diagnosis (we had two options, but could only take one of the options due to the fact they did not have a particular specialist onsite... Hmmmm).  We called them 4 times to speak to the Doctor and discuss further next steps and we never received a call back - It has been almost a month since the exam/x-rays.  Each time I called , I was told the Dr. would call us back shortly and they never did.  This is UNACCEPTABLE!  We trusted the care of our pet and their unresponsiveness determined they did NOT care and are unreliable.  We love our pets and we believe they deserve the best treatment possible. This place just wanted  our money and didn't care what happens to our pet.  Very unhappy!!!< /text>

Asked an employee how long the results would take from “lab” 🔬&  they said I should know by the next day because the dr does his own tests in house.       (Dr told me he sends to lab🤔😒)
out of a 1500$ bill I opted for a only a few services  & now they will not respond with the “lab” results.
No matter the time calling the dr is always unavailable & I’ll ask if they can read my results but they say the dr has to call me. It’s been a month no results. During COVID the Facility definitely wasn’t clean.</review>

They treated my dog with care and the price for a check up and any medication needed, is reasonable. And if it's too expensive, they seem like they'll work with you on that. At least that's what I think.</review>

Scamsters. Our dog had a surgery scheduled on Saturday to remove his bladder stones. When we arrived, the doctor is not interested to perform the surgery saying the quote they provided maybe incorrect. They wanted to perform more test for $400. We agreed and made the payment but haven't received a call for 3 days now. We were promised the vet would call us for sure the next day before we made the payment. We called 4 times so far and vet wouldn't talk. This place is just a scam and should be investigated and shut down. Please stay away.<//Review>

First, it took such a long time just to get someone to answer the phone. I was put on hold twice for 10 minutes each time. It’s severely understaffed.

Second, they didn’t honour thier own price of $65 for my cats neuter. It cost me $130. The girl who helped me her exact words “We need to change the website, we are vet people not computer people.” What does that mean!?
It clearly says on the website that price is valid until 12/2020 which makes no sense at all.

Finally, when picking him up it took so long and I was so mad. There was no one at the counter to help. Once someone did help me, they asked if I had brought a carrying case or box. I had brought him in his own case!

This is a place you come if you have no other choice. I made a huge mistake by bringing my cat here and I hope that this review will save others time, money, and effort.

Please don’t bring your pets here. It has been a horrible experience. The ladies working the front look overwhelmed. The owner and vet should be ashamed.< /text>< username>

I have been going here for over a year and every experience is not good. You can make an appointment but you won’t get a doctor for another 30-45 minutes. I think there main issue is with the front desk girls in the past they had some real air heads but they seem to have hired a couple new girls that can handle the job. The only good doctor is the one that went to Wisconsin. The other guy is a nitwit. Overall they  are mediocre. Fairly priced. But if there’s a wait. Plan to be there a while. Oh, and one more thing, it usually smells like dog pee. It’s a good day if it doesn’t.<//Review>

<Time>1607407719446</Time><Rating>1</Rating><Review>15 years ago I found this Vet when my cat was very sick.  Dr Salwan was amazing, kind and helped me through a cancer diagnosis and treatment.  Never had any issues with the staff, etc.  Years later, my other cat came down with the same cancer and Dr Salwan was again, very helpful and compassionate.

Fast forward to now and the story is VASTLY different.  I called last Sunday to get help for my 1.5yr cat who hadn't used the litter box is a few days and was vomiting liquid (he is known to try to eat anything he can find, just like a puppy).  They could not see him.  Not only that but the girl on the other end of the line was rude and dismissive.  What a horrible way to treat someone who has a sick animal.  I ended up taking kitty to Beacon for emergency service.  They were compassionate, responsive and helpful.  Bloodwork, x-rays, fluids......unfortunately no diagnosis was found.

Follow up today with his regular vet and we saw Dr Salwan.  I was hopeful for the same good service I'd once had.  I left kitty for x-rays and expected a call back to discuss next step.  3 hrs later I called to check, the answer was simply "you can come pick him up now".  Wait, what?  What's wrong with him?  How are we going to fix it?  Nobody has contacted me.  I am then told oh sorry, x-ray results take 1-2 days, doctor will talk to you then.  I'm sorry but the cat is not eating, is dehydrated and has not had a bowel movement in a week.  I am absolutely disgusted with this service.  This is a life we are talking about, a member of my family.  I have now spent $1600 and my cat is still very sick with no path forward.  This is unacceptable.  What has happened to this place?

Additionally, I neglected to comment on the fact that I had a similar incident in August with my 9yo cat.  Took days to get results from his x-rays.  Many phone calls, thankfully, his was a minor issue and was resolved easily.......luckily.

Dr Salwan is a good Vet, WHEN he is onsite.  Seems he doesn't work there much anymore and the staff is overworked and frustrated.  This may be an OK place if you need simple things like vaccinations or a simply check-up.  But for Gods sake, don't bring your animal here if it is ill, who knows how long it will take to get them checked IF they can even see you when you need to be seen.

First time I've ever written a review..... I hope this helps prevent the anxiety and needless cost that I 've had.....and still with no fix for my sweet little cat.

Update : 4 days later, Dr still hasn't called to talk to me about the results.</Review>< pictures>

I took my dog in recently for treatment and I was so pleased with the staff and Vet. They were so informative about my dog’s condition and explained fully so that I understood what treatment was needed and the assistant also showed me step by step how to administer the antibiotics which I appreciated because I am an elder.  Their charges are very reasonable.  I highly recommend Tri City.< /Text>

DO NOT GO HERE unless you want to wait an hour to see a vet, wait another hour to get your animal back after a procedure, be put on hold for 45 mins only for someone to hang up on you and pay extra money for bloodwork and not have it be offered to you after having it be recommended. We had to take our cat to another pet hospital because his ear was still infected, the new pet hospital prescribed the same ear medication as tricity but told us it needed to be refrigerated so we were probably giving our pet expired medication. On top of that, the new pet hospital tried calling tricity for previous records and were told they have no record of us after the receptionist was diligent enough to put in the correct number after being told multiple times. Prices may be seem appealing but do not go here, they are clearly understaffed and the receptionists have no idea how to handle a busy situation.</Review>

Went for my dog neutered yesterday. The lady look Asian was so nice and keep us updated but the end of the day I wish I remembered her name but she definitely remembered me. I paid and she said nothing about it. I asked her well... you are supposed to give us some information how to take care the dog. She was like let me see. Then she typed on the computer and see that I need the medication for my dog. I was like she was going to let me go with out giving me this and any advice. I asked her if I want to talk to the doctor because every place to visit I always see  doctor. She said no. And then she read all the instructions how to take care a dog after surgery. Me and my parents wasn’t happy how unprofessional of her. She couldn’t give us the simple instructions and the doctor wasn’t there. We will be back in 2 weeks. We feel like we don’t want to go back anymore.<//Review>

< review>
I recently visited this vet with a stray kitten I saved. I was told the first exam would be free & took him in. When I arrived I was told he needed tests to check his stomach, which we paid for because we were told he was very ill with stomach problems. We noticed before we left that we were also charged for the visit. We asked to have that refunded but I was already alarmed with the lack of communication and follow thru. As days went on I called because I had heard nothing about the tests the vet recommended. I called the first time & was told by a very rude employee that the lab had a mix up & it would take longer for results then without even a sorry or goodbye I was hung up on. I waited two more days only to call & find out that they had no results & needed another sample from my kitten, that they claimed was close to death but if so why wasn't there any follow thru with his tests. I asked for a refund on the test & told them I would be taking my kitten to another vet.  I was told my refund for just the test would be given but there was no responsibility taken for the poor service or the fact my animal was not treated as a priority. I strongly suggest taking your animals to another vet that will take your beloved animals health issues seriously & not waste time & take your money with no results or apology. I was extremely disappointed with this vet because this was a scary & dangerous situation for my kitten & they could care less to even understand my feelings & frustration from their mix up. I paid them $300.00 only for them to screw up my animals tests & give me no answers. Now I've wasted a whole week & have to put my kitten thru another exam with another vet because my time & hard earned money was wasted. The staff needs to work on their follow thru & bedside manner because they suck at customer service.< /review>

Upon calling to schedule my first appointment, I felt that the receptionist was rude and I was surprised that she was uninterested in the reasoning for my requested vet visit.
I arrived at the facility and walked across the large waiting area towards the two women; one of which shouted at me multiple times to “sign in over there”.... “sign in over there”... while pointing. How incredibly unprofessional.
I continued to approach the desk and informed the woman that I was a new patient and I was wondering if there was any paperwork I needed to fill out. “Oh” she says and then hands me a clipboard and paper. I return the paperwork to her and await my appointment.
My appointment time arrives and I am informed by the receptionist who instead of walking over to me decides to yell across the facility that the doctor will be late. I ask her how late she thinks and she shrugs then tells me like 10 minutes. Super professional people.
17 minutes after my appointment time, I am called to the back and roomed. Luckily, the doctor I saw was amazing and had a very professional demeanor. After the appointment was over I walked with a vet tech to the front desk and was checked out. I was very relieved that she seemed to know how to do her job and present herself in a professional manner. I requested for an email of the combined vaccination records, as I had provided all previous vaccination records from my previous vet, so that I could forward them to our boarding facility.
Upon receiving them, I was taken aback by the sheer lack of effort in creating my file. I informed them via phone call of the error in my address and the dates that did not correctly correspond with the previous vet vaccination record due dates that they had merged into their system. I was informed there was nothing she could do right now to correct that because they were “closing in TEN MINUTES” and she will just “make sure I do not get any notifications since the info is wrong”...
Low-cost vet but you truly get what you pay for.
Thank you to the doctor who treated myself and my dog well but we will not be returning.</review>< user_id>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Worst experience! We brought in two bearded dragons. Staff at the front seemed overworked and unhappy (who could blame them working in that lighting). Also, pretty unhelpful. We went in 5 times in 2 months and every time I asked a question, they looked around for someone else. The person who came out to help only had an answer half the time. A few times those answers were rude and/or down right wrong! One of them told me that I was the one that made my animal sick because I didn’t wash my hands well enough. The Doc seemed very confused when I told him that. The doc was nice but knowledge was also lacking. He outsourced feedback for all of the test results from other vets and when I would ask him about basic care, he would just say that he didn’t know. We ALWAYS had to wait at least half an hour past our appointment time just to get into the room (1.5 hours once), then we would wait some more. We had to wait a week and a half (5 phone calls & 1 email) to get our test results and that was AFTER they told us that they had received the test results and wanted to give them to us. When I decided that we would NEVER be going back, I asked for copies of both of my pets charts. Again it took a week to get them. Then I asked for the Dr’s notes, submitted a written request (required) and after 3 phone calls over a 2 week span, I finally gave up on them!</review>< pictures>

This was my first appointment at this facility. The wait time to check in for an appointment was ridiculously long. At least the receptionists were nice and apologized for the wait time (the only reason I gave two stars). I'm not sure why it took an additional hour to get my cat vaccinated (I was informed it would only take about 15 minutes).

The veterinarian was not friendly or welcoming at all. I don't even know his name since he didn't bother introducing himself. He was condescending for the most part, and he didn't even remotely seem interested in my cat's medical history. As a healthcare provider, I have high expectations, and I have to say this vet barely met the minimum requirements for medical standards of care. I just wish this vet could be a little more compassionate and caring (or at least pretend) when he's examining his furry patients.

I strongly recommend you visit another practice. If you do come here, be prepared to wait a LENGTHY time for unsatisfactory service.< /Review>

< Review>
Very displeased with the service and they miss out to provide most of the detail about vaccines. Although they recommend to get the vaccination in timely manner seems like they fail to keep track of what is already done and forget to mention when is the next one.

The doctors are good and expect to be treated well although they seem to be busy and is hard to get hold of them.

Price wise they are on the cheaper side so expect to wait longer for the service.

All the bad reviews are for the rest of the service including poor customer service and uninformed staffs who will put you on hold to get answer for every question whether on phone or in-person.

I had asked them if my puppy was due for any vaccination for 3 times I visited them and over the phone and they said know. On my last visit I found that I missed a vaccine by a month as I was not infomed.<//Review>

<text>The worst experience I’ve ever had. I had an appointment at 4:30pm, but they called me to cancel my appointment at 4pm because of an “emergency”. They said the next available appointment is 1 week later. Should they be responsible for the delay which may cause illness or death of my dog? My dog was bite by ticks and I could not remove them by myself. The ticks could be fatal if they couldn’t be removed in time. This hospital doesn’t respect their customers and has no responsibility.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<user_id>117985908798002884736< /user_id><time>1579618573682< /time><Resp>None</Resp><review>I made an appointment for my dog and walked into pure chaos. There were two couples and 4 other people standing by the check-out portion of the desk. A woman who had already put on her coat and her cross-body purse was helping customers. She was obviously ready to get out of there - it was only 3:30. I saw someone bring out a dog from being neutered and the dog owner having to ask about at home care and medicine. The woman with the purse gave a very rushed reply and picked up some medicine from behind the counter. At this point, many people starting complaining about having to wait 30 minutes for medicine for their dog. I also heard the women behind the counter talking about missing files that “weren’t their fault” and casting blame on coworkers. It was chaotic, dirty, and definitely the worst run vet I’ve seen. By minute 10 of waiting, I turned around and walked out.< /review>< Gmap_id>

Very good appointment. Informative. They have a medication that I need it for my dogs right there. It was just the medicine but they had it in stock. My only concern is that I was not notified there if there was a need for follow up. I’m thinking that my animals may have needed the rabies booster. So I’ll just wait for a notification. That’s the only reason it’s not five stars.</text>

GREAT ... service, doctors, and prices !

The doctors know what they're doing, if you provide good details of the conditions your pet is experiencing, they're good at getting to the root cause, and properly addressing the issue.

If you just show up, they want to do a round of diagnostics as a baseline to work with, which makes complete sense.

i had a dog who got a a large splinter embedded under their skin that the doctor at first thought was a possible tumor, so he wanted to do more investigation.

i asked him to cut the splinter out, which generated a concern on his part that i was asking him to cut open my dog even though he didn't know what was in there.

that is a very healthy response from the doctor, but i'd witnessed it happening and knew it was a wood splinter, so i very much appreciated his trust in me as the owner to do the surgery.

and he removed the sticker, and makita is all better now !

the concern on the doctor's part, as well as his flexibility on saving on testing to check for a tumor reflect great service in terms of trying to please a pet owner.

thank you for the great service, jeff<//review>

The staff are super friendly and went out of their way to make sure I understood how to take care of my animals before and after surgery. The lobby was full of smiling faces, with customers bonding over their pets. The surgery itself was very well done (impressively small incisions!) I definitely recommend this place for the knowledgeable and friendly staff!< /text>

Friendly staff. The first technician seemed new and didn't seem confident administering the vaccines on my cat though he tried. He then called on a more senior technician to come in. The second tech seemed confident and experienced. He finished the two shots on my cat in less than a minute.

However, in general, the wait time can be improved in between check-in and seeing the doctor, waiting for technicians to come in and administer the shots, also during check out. I waited for about 20 minutes for my 11am appointment before we are called in. The check-out process also took about 20 minutes because the staff had to hand-write my cat's rabies shot certification and then transfer it onto a computer. Process seems a bit outdated.<//Text>

<text>Super disappointed. This place used to be clean and vet was welcoming. Now this place is filthy. It used to be an ok place. It has a repulsive strong smell of urine and feces. There is literally urine stains on the wall and caked into the tile floors grout. Last time I went there, I confronted the front desk about the poor conditions and they simply replayed that it was the AC ventilation that doing it. Really ??? ...  not to mention large amounts of animal hair everywhere and the waiting room seats are ripped and torn. I’m taking my pets elsewhere so they or I dont get sick from stepping into this place.< /text>< resp>

The veterinarians seem competent, but the facilities are a mess. Smells like urine, dirty, the benches in the waiting area are ripped and filthy. The exam rooms are no better. Makes one really question the sanitary conditions in this place.  We've been taking our dogs there for over a year and have always paid in full at the time of service. We scheduled to board our dogs for one night and they insisted on full payment prior to boarding, they also refused to see our sick dog (vomiting and bloody stool) without payment up-front. Moral of the lesson - if you decide to use the office, bring sanitizer and a big bag of cash.< /Text>

The best veterinary hospital in the area. Very courteous and helpful staff and a very clean and well maintained facility that is open 7 days a week. The doctors have decades of experience and are very knowledgeable, friendly and professional.  At this hospital I can get my dogs treated, get their prescriptions, dog treats and food for a very reasonable fees.</Text>

This place will kill your pet!!!!!!!!!!! My cat had a tumor we paid over $600 they didn't tell us anything. 3months later we found out from a different veterinary my cat been having this medical condition for the past 7 months its was too late by then.

All the good reviews are fake they post that themselves. The doctor don't care about the health of your pet its just business to him! Most of the stuff is nice and caring that's the best you'll get.

They can't keep records NOT organized/ its filthy in the back where they do their operations< /Review>

HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND DOCTOR DONESN'T CARE YOUR PET AT ALL. Spending $600 and still not getting the treatment plan and prescription after 2 days waiting. I brought my cat to the hospital and did X-ray, blood-work, and consultation which cost $600 to just trying to diagnose what was going on. Right after the exams, the doctor told me we would need to wait until tomorrow when the result is available and he will personally call me and this never happened and I did try called, texted and emailed the hospital multiple times. After 2 day's waiting in anxiety, there is  a couple of takeaways 1) the doctor did make the right diagnose and took the right direction, but this didn't matter if the treatment plan didn't come in time 2) I certainly question the management of the hospital, very unprofessional and the staffs keep making empty promises 3) both of the staffs and the doctor are lack of sense of responsibility and empathy, given the fact that they would keep delaying the dingoes and treatment for a very sick pet for more than 48 hours.<//review>

Love this place! We have been bringing our beagles here since 1997 and they have been getting excellent care. A very compassionate staff.  I can highly recommend them without any reservations.The prices are very reasonable & the extended hours make bringing my pets in after work very convenient.<//text>

Went to their clinic 2 weeks ago to get a refund, I was told they will send the check the following day. It's over 2 weeks now and still haven't got the check. Called their accounting office today and they will take a look at it. This is a terrible place and I have horror experienced about this place every time I brought my dog.

I was trying to find a reasonable place to have my dog Nita teeth clean.  I had called a Vet. Clinic in Half Moon Bay and San Mateo, I couldn't believe they wanted to charge over $1,000.00.  I found Tricity Vet on line.  I was impressed with the lady that arrange my visit, I couldn't believe how professional they were when I got there.  They are equipped with just about better than any Vet Clinic I had visit.  The cost was one forth of what I had have to pay.  Thank you Tricity, I am your customer now.<//text>

This is my second time taking Sterling in for an ear infection in both ears. The Vet was very kind to Sterling. They told me how to care for the ears and told me what the next step is if the infection doesn't go away. Everyone there loved my cat and was very attentive to him. The only thing I would change is the waiting rooms smelt of dog urine really strongly.I didn't want to put Sterling on the floor. Perhaps they can have better hygiene for the rooms. I  don't remember the vet's name but he was very professional and Sterling didn't have a problem with him.< /Review>

I'm only giving one star, because I have to, but if I had a choice, I would give none.

I brought my 4 month old teacup puppy in after he was showing signs of being wobbly, tired and completely out of it. The doctor, a heavy set Indian man (he never told us his name) came in with zero emotion and did an "exam" on our puppy. His exam consisted of checking his heart beat, his gums and pressing in certain areas of his body; no temperature check and no ear check, which is a pretty common practice when performing a physical exam on any animal.

He then suggested $600 worth of blood tests, x-rays and medications. However, we can't afford that so we opted out of the blood tests and x-rays and just got the medications. He told us our pup would receive a shot to help rehydrate his body and another that would be an antibiotic. However, later in the evening when we were looking up the side effects of the medication he was given since he was showing weakness and pain in his sides and back, we found out it wasn't an antibiotic at all. It was instead an antiemetic which is to help stop vomiting (which wasn't a major concern when we brought him in).

While we were waiting for his shots to be done, a man came in saying that he had called CHP about a cat being hit by a car and was told they brought the cat here...He asked about the cat's well being and they said the cat was very aggressive, and would be sent to the SPCA where they would probably not adopt it out and then put it down. The man wanted to adopt the cat to save it from such a fate, and the same doctor who saw us, tried to talk him out of it. I couldn't believe it!

Do NOT take your pet here ever. They don't care about your animals, they care about their checks. All those "Google User" reviews are fake reviews from the company itself trying to praise themselves so that suckers like us come in. They are absolutely insincere, lack compassion, and really only want as much money as they can get from you...and my dog isn't even better.</text>

Very affordable and good care. May not be the best if severe  pet illness and so people should not expect exceptional treatment as such low prices. But for routine exams and care, I found very easy to simply walk in without any appointments and get the necessary advise or treatment.< /Review>

<Review>AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!! Animal vet? More like animal abuse!

Horrible place. We used their boarding service and our dog was half dead after only four/five days. They lost our leash and our dog lost 2 pounds and was severely dehydrated, super dirty, and hungry with no energy. A rude and unhelpful Hispanic lady was aggressive and should not be dealing with any animals or humans!

If you have any love for your pet, DO NOT COME HERE!!! We will be submitting a formal compliant with the necessary authorities.<//Review>< pics>

I saw Dr. Bhullar on 4-24-18 for my 16 year old cat Mama. He understood all my needs. I did not want to do a dental unless it was life threatening and I did not want to give any vaccinations to a 16 year old cat who got vaccinations when she was younger. I started her on antibiotics for an urinary infection a few days later.< /Review>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Text>I spent over a thousand dollars on surgery for my dog and was told it covered after care visit and stitch removal and then went for an after care visit and was charged for the visit. When I asked to speak to the doctor I was told he refused to see me and had to pay for the visit to get my dog the medication he needed. They overcharge and up-sell like crazy. While most vets do, I still expect the doctor to do follow up visit as payed for in original bill. Won’t be going there again</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Thor and I have only been to the office just once for his first check up and shots.  The office was clean, the people all friendly, and the doctor we saw was informative and really loving with my Thor.  We'll be using Tricity Veterinary Hospital as our regular vets without a doubt.< /Text>< user_name>

<Review>Very shady business with questionable ethics. I take writing negative reviews seriously. This business has a history on BBB as settling mistreatment cases in exchange for withholding negative reviews. My dog was kept here for multiple days. Over that time multiple antibiotic treatments were started, but never finished. With no progress being made and being told to accept the potential that we’d lose the dog we switched to a different vet. Within one day at the new vet office our dog was better and released to come home.<//Review>< pics>

Pet medication is not available during all work day hours even with a scheduled appointment, poor communication among the staff and will have to take time out of your day to fix their mistakes. I've never had a business explain to me how to solve their problems before coming to tricity vet. I'll be spending more money to get my dog what he needs because they were not prepared for the actual appointment. Stay away.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Horrible staff all around.
I decided to take my pet here for a checkup on some bleeding since my usual vet was not available to see me on that day.  Dr. Salwan took x-rays and said report will be available in 24 hours.
I called repeatedly the next day and the vet never called me back.  I called again at 7PM and Jamie who answered the phone said all the vets are gone for the day and she cannot discuss my report.  Jamie was absolutely useless and not helpful and suggested that I can take my pet to the ER if I am worried.  I would have taken my pet to the ER and not waited a whole day if they had just told me how incompetent they are the day prior.

There is a reason why the review is so bad here.  Do yourself a favor and take your pet elsewhere and avoid this place.<//Text>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>I brought my cat in for examination as she was expressing to me for a few weeks that she was unwell, after an examination that didn't include anything but looking at her, the dr suggested deworming. I went ahead with the first round and went to pay for the first and second round, but they didn't have change for a $100 bill. They told me to give them the 100 and they would put it in my file that I was to receive change when I return for the second round. My cat reacted really badly to the first round, so I cancelled the second round and have been in twice to try to get my change back. They won't give it to me, saying a manager needs to be there for them to do anything. Absolute joke of an institution. They still owe me $56.

Edit: I came in over 30 times, almost any time I was passing by, over the course of a year before they offered me my change, and only by check. I was treated poorly multiple times. I'm amazed this place is still in business.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Review>Worse clinic ever , I was waiting with my kitten for 20 mins waiting for the nurse to give me a list of medication with prices since it's was my first visit and I'm not familiar with the things.
I can hear them laughing running arround like they are having a party leaving me with my kitten alone
I don't recommend it at all and I believe they are very cheap prices and services<//Review>< pictures>

I first brought my Pup into Tricity, May 2015. Dr. Salwan and the other staff doctors treated her with cutting-edge technology. There was  a quick diagnosis, treatment and she recovered almost immediately. I did have a small issue with the administrative staff, trying to sort paper work and appointment times, but is was remedied. A year had past and I bought Pup in for another ailment. Again, Dr. Salwan quickly diagnosed the condition and put her on a medical regiment  that brought her back to good health. He is quite knowledgeable about veterinary medicine and communicates his expertise to the pet owner professionally and with a sense of humor. The admin. staff has improved, but still needs some support. Overall Tricity provides all the needs for you pets.<//Text>

these guys are not very professional , once you enroll for their wellness plan , they still charge you as if you don't have the wellness plan for which i have been paying $15 a month for last 2+ years . Every time i have to remind them that i am on wellness plan .
I called them 3 times to cancel my wellness plan and they said they can't do it so i even went there personally and then they said their manager was not there and they'll call me back . No one called me back since last 2 months , i didn't bother to call them again but now they have asked me to write this review so i remember that they are taking $15 /month and i have not been there since last many months .< /Review>

I used to go to Banfield but it was time to get our shitzu spade and had to look for less expensive alternatives. Tricity was much much better not only was the cost half the cost of Banfied but so much cleaner and less crowded. I love this place and would highly recommend.</review>

This place it's  a joke .  Have  been  taking my pets there for about 5 years . Big big change  after change in ownership  . Place just went down hill. Las time my dog was at the hospital.for a week . Had no calls, no return calls   and really bad info  in  how my dog was doing  had yo take my dog to a different  place. Avoid  your self  a headache  and don't  go to this plave it should be close  and not allow  to have a license again.< /Review>

Doctor Raj is the reason my aunt's RABBIT DIED!

When taking the rabbit (Neffy) in for a simple checkup checkup DR Raj Salwan recommended an x-ray. He never brought up the risk of the x-ray or informed us Neffy would be put to sleep for it. After picking Neffy up she was really drugged up. Raj said that she was okay there was noting to be worried about she just had a hair ball and water and pineapple juice would fix it. They diagnosis also clearly stated that Gastris Stasis was RULED OUT. Later that day around 8 Neffy was not looking good at all. She seemed like she was in pain and couldn't really move. My sister was so worried she called the vet. A receptionist spoke to Raj and told us that everything was fine (not to worry) and that it could take about 24 hours before she's okay. They also mentioned that they have her more of a dosage because she was a bigger rabbit (she's a dwarf rabbit). My sister asked are you sure because she doesn't look good and I don't want her to die in the middle of the night. Again the receptionist said not to worry she just had a hairball and the drugs will ware off.

Neffy died that night. A very slow uncomfortable death.

To make matters worse we were never able to get a hold of Raj despite making appointments with him and coming in 6 and calling countless more. Someone at the office thought it was better to inform us that Neffy died because of Gastris Stasis and that it was a very serious issue they couldn't do anything about. But remember when it was RULED OUT. Tri city Veterinary Hospital diagnosed Neffy after she died and began hiding information (such as what she was drugged with and x rays) so we couldn't determine what actually killed her.

Neffy was my aunt's rabbit. After an accident that took away her ability to walk she went through depression. It was recommends that she get a pet to overcome this. That's where Neffy entered our family. My aunt now blames herself because if she just went to a different vet or not taken Neffy in at all She would still be alive.

I don't think I could sleep at night knowing this could happen to someone else's pet.
The least Tri city Veterinary Hospital could do is make a change. To not take on an animal they don't know how to care for. To use the correct amount of dosage. To understand that a life is in their hands and decisions have terrible consequence to others.<//Text>

No star!!! Terrible service front counter worker has no clue what she doing. Was given the wrong meds for my dog after telling them several times what meds She needed. Then they refused to take the wrong meds back and give the correct meds. Long story short I called my bank and cancelled my payment to them. Won't be going back!!< /Review>

this is a very good hospital, it is clean, the doctor is friendly and knowledgeable, and the staff is very nice. I would recommend this hospital.
the one problem I had is that when I scheduled my puppy for his neutering they gave me a time for my appointment when they DON'T do neuterings. they called later the next day and told me I had to reschedule for another day and time. In my opinion, the receptionist should have known this information bc its basic information for services that's their bread and butter. it was bad. I work so it just happened that I was off the next  day too.if I wasn't it would have been a hassle, and an unnecessary headache trying to take a day off, reschedule, or something. I ask one of the receptionist how much the tranquilizer pills are, later after the operation on the phone, and she gave me a range as if she didn't know. in my opinion, she should know the number bc she sells or might sell those pills all the time, bc neutering is what they do most often.
other than the receptionist not knowing very well what they should know, its a very good hospital. just ask all the right questions before going so you won't be surprised.< /Text>

Very good experience with my dog. Was kind of leary about going here due to the reviews but I'm glad we went. My dog's jaw was swollen and had a cracked toorh. She had to have surgery. Dr and staff were very informative and dr called to check on my dog after I brought her home. We still have to go back post op to remove drain from my dog's jaw but overall experience has been good this far. The only con would be the wait. I didnt see but a few people there and we had to wait awhile.< /text>

And I was so upset at the amount they were asking. I was desperate. I came across the Tri-City Vet. I went in and spoke to the the staff and vet. I am on a fixed income and I love my girl. They examined her and she had to have 6 teeth pulled and gum cleaning. The quote they gave me was so much less than the others. They worked with me and called me right after the procedure to let me knoe how she was doing. I picked her up and she ran to me and we were so happy. She passed away a year and a half later at the age of 18.  I thank them for being so understanding and passionate with her. If and when I get another dog as I'm still in morning, this is the place to go for my pets. It helps when  you can count o a trusted vet to be there to get your baby girl or boy back to their health.. The Tri-City Veterinary Hospital is the best place to go. And there is always someone there to answer questions on the phone and in person. Us senior citizens in this economy today need places like this. It's just too bad that you can't find places like this anymore.< /Review>< GmapID>

DO NOT USE THIS FACILITY.
My mother boarded her cat here for two nights. Some how the staff here lost him in the celing the first night, lied about it and we are going on week 6 now with him still up there. This incompetence is absolutly ridiculous.<//Text>

I am surprised is still even open. My dog broke out in hives one day and we had originally scheduled her to see one of the veterinarian at 12:00. Once I showed up with my dog, they stated that he wasn't even there and would not be in until 2! They continuous fail to inform their patients owners, they repeatedly make billing mistakes and every time I go there, the facility is so disgusting! The lady with blonde hair in the front is ALWAYS so rude and does not hesitate to express your carelessness of the animals and the people that walk through that door. I have already spoken to the manager in regards to this TWICE and surprisingly that lady still has a job there. DO NOT EVER take your animal there on the weekends or in general if you care for your pets! If I could do 0 stars, i would!</Text>

Best place to buy tires BUT always expect long time waiting even you have an appointment which sometimes they call you to set an appointment but when you got there your not in the system. Worst customer service especially Brandon. Got no respect to customer.</Text>

<rate>4< /rate><text>Knowledgeable employees & great service. I had a flat when I came out from shopping at Costco. My son needed a ride to the airport that night and I already knew I was needing to replace the tires soon so I drove around to their tire center. It was busy because they just started a tire sale. They didn't have the size I needed in stock at that location but were able to call & confirm that a nearby warehouse still had all 4 in stock. It was the first day of their tire sale so they recommended not waiting long to get them if I didn't want to wait for them to be ordered.

I got AAA to put my spare on & headed over to the other warehouse. I was able to purchase the tires but there were many people in front of me so the wait was long. The employee confirmed that I could return later that day or the next day with my receipt to have the tires installed (since I didn't have much time before I had to pick up my son & take him to the airport.) That's what I did! Great job on the installation & balancing the next day. They were busy but were able to finish in half the time

If I could give just one bit of advice to the workers that would have made this review 5 stars instead of 4, it would be to please wash their hands or put on some clean gloves before they enter the cars. I had several black fingerprints on my interior...some in odd places too like on the upholstered frame of the little side window by the windshield and up by the sun roof. I just had the car detailed not long ago so that was disappointing to see. Friendly service though and good workmanship on the tire installation.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<review>Best price around. All the tires are top of the line no knock off cheap tires. Wait isn't too bad but setting an appointment or dropping off the car is best.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Helpful and speedy. You can make an appointment to minimize your wait time. Also buy your batteries here! They have a great warranty on them and they are quality batteries.< /Review>

Its currently been 15 minutes and no employee has asked me if I need any help or anything at all for that matter. There are three technicians just standing there talking. There is one person being helped. Does anyone else see a problem with this? Please do better customer service training. Don't come here because you just might not be helped.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

This tire center has a self-serve nitrogen inflator so you can conveniently top up your tires without having to check in at the service desk.  You specify the pressure you want to your tires to be at, and the machine adds air until the desired psi is reached.  Ultra convenient!<//Text>

NEVER again ! Plus the attendant left me on hold for 45 plus minutes just to make the appointment! I have since cancelled the appointment and am just going to take it in the shorts and find a reputable tire center and get it done in one easy step, shame on Costco,  hopefully folks that see this review will shop elsewhere,  poor mismanagement of the tire center in San Bernardino.</text>< pics>

Costco is overrated. I arrived at 9:15 on a Saturday to be first (or one of the firsts) in line for when they opened at 9:30. They were already open and had four or five people already in line in front of me, which took forever. I got a quote for two tires, rotation and service that would cost near $500. I went to American Tire Depot, and got two tires, rotation and balance, service and alignment for $389.< /Text>

< review>
How odd it is that when they are selling you tires, they want you to buy everything and anything and the most expensive. BUT, when you have a question about the tires that they installed on backwards, (directional tires) they (Costco tire employees) don't want to talk to you and are very rude and put you on hold for 15 to 20 minutes and then hang the phone up. So you call back and have to go through the same thing over again and again they are extremely rude.....<//review>

I have gone to this shop multiple times and normally just shrug it off when they make a mistake. Not this time; this last hair cut was trash and it showed. I expect a higher quality of work and for a barber to pride themselves on their craft as apposed to treating it as a joke. will never go there again and recommend you don't either.< /text>

<Review>THEY CARE FOR WHO'S IN THEIR CHAIR.

I have been trying to find a barber who interacts with my 7 year old. My son is very independent and knows what he wants. Anthony is SOOO great with that. My son holds full conversation while getting his hair cut the way HE wants it cut. I appreciate the acknowledgement he gives him. I would recommend West Coast Barber Shop to every parent who has to let their once baby, now big boy grow up.<//Review><user>108439330881891049892<//user></record>

Good cuts. I'm normally a walk in. But I set up an appointment and still waiting for about an hour because the barber wanted to take his time on his break. Other then that great cuts and just an over all good place.< /text>

Online says they close at 6pm . Today ( 2-15-20) at 3pm . Me and my son walked in they told us they are no longer taking walk ins.  When it says they close at 6pm online.  This is the only reason I gave them 1 star .</Text>

Had my hair cut by George. Extremely unprofessional with me and kind of rude. Furthermore he cut my hair terribly. Second time was with Saul, he was also extremely unprofessional. I waited there for three hours one time. If your going to go there, you need to make an appointment.<//Text>

Good barber shop. Guys are friendly and always do a good job on my sons hair and always cut it how he wants it. Only one problem, everytime I call, all they say is "hello?" Like they're answering their home phone. I always have to ask if I called the right place. Nobody ever says their name when they pick up so we never know who my son is supposed to ask for. You kinda get tossed around on the phone to whoever has an opening that day. These guys really could use a receptionist to answer calls and book appointments. Other than that, the shop itself is great, always clean and comfortable.< /Text>

First time going in there, I even told the guy cutting my hair it's my first time. The guy who cut my hair was okay with clippers but horrible with scissors.. I came out looking like I just got a haircut from a lawn mower. I had to tell him there's a couple spots he missed when he was about "done" with my haircut. Not pleased at all with the service and definitely not with the haircut! First impressions are everything. Not coming again.<//review>

<review>A MUST GO - If you want it done by the pro's with a good attitude - Go see my boy Kane - Major Props to a fresh cut every time. Designs are on point - make sure to stop in even if its a drive - its worth every penny.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I've been to Texas, miami, georgia, and up and down the west coast and have yet to find another barbershop like this. Professional clean and always fresh. Most definitely recommend it to anyone looking for the best.</Text>

Big shout out to west coast barber I came in town from TEXAS and they got me right in walk in and hooked it up a fresh fade the best I have had with my slick back. Ask for Saul or any of his co-barber's and they will hook it up.< /Review>

It's a good mosque but they do not follow any covid guidelines, there's no social distancing and it's very dangerous. People are standing very close to each other. I know Allah wants us to pray but does he want us to risk our lives for it?. Please if the mosque people reading this please make social distancing happen and safety first.<//Review>

If you're seeking knowledge in God this is the place to visit. After every prayer on Friday they have food provided for a price and it's always delicious. And a place of worship is very sanitary and the people are very kind for the men women and children they will really enjoy it.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

It was a nice experience, Yesenia, the lady who helped me showed her experience working there, she got all the right sizes with just looking at me and since I was only looking to see if it was the right store to buy a suit, she did made some offers that made me make the purchase at this moment. The suggestions about colors and stile and colors were to my satisfaction, I am very pleased with her service. I am coming back to buy the next suit.</text>

Yessenia was friendly, and offered professional service, and and demonstrated awesome multitasker skills, helping multiple clients at once. They offer quick and fast tailoring, specially if you need a suit ASAP.  Great deals! Highly recommended.<//Review>

<text>I went to Men's District not knowing much about suits. Luckily Mike was there to help me out. Solid guy, helped me find the perfect fit and wasn't the sales type that constantly tries to up sale you.

<Text>I walked into this place needing a shirt. Walked out with a few more items that I needed as well. Erika the sales woman there was beyond exceptional when it came to assisting me. She helped color coordinate my suit with such ease. If you need anything that requires semi-formal to formal wear, you definitely need to come in and talk to Erika. Also great prices.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

We took a while to choose our suits, we’re pretty particular, but Ysenia was super patient with us and awesome! She took us through the different cuts and sizes, as well as brands, to make sure we felt right at home. Thanks so much!</review>

First of all, they give you a free tie for an in store review ...   So consider that when reading these 5 star reviews.
1.  Bought a suit there a few weeks ago for an important event this Saturday.   Even though sign outside says $129/for suit, when I checked out they wouldn't honor the sign, but I liked the suit so I paid the $200 extra also paid for alterations at that time.  Extra $30+
2.  The lady working did not take my measurements, instead I tried on different suits of different styles and color in store until I was comfortable.  That should have been my first sign this place was less than a professional suit store.
3.  No one called when my suit came in, I had to keep calling.
4.  Finally someone found my suit, on one of the days I called so I went in to pick it up and have the alterations done.
5.  Jacket was too small.  Workers response..."Its the same size as the suit you tried on that you said fit..."  I said but this one clearly is too small as my sleeves came up to my elbows in front of her.  Her response..."No refunds."
6.  Pants were too big.  Her response, "They came with the jacket."  No refunds, exchange is $50 and will take a week."
7.  No refunds per employee, exchange was going to be $40-50 for each item and take a week.  I had 2 days until my event.
8.  "Alterations only included my pant legs, to hem the waist was another $40-$50 and would take a week".
9.  She would not refund my alterations cost so I could have them done at a real alterations facility, so I let her.   I'm going to try to upload the pant leg Pics that she did from her sewing machine.   It was so bad I had to pay to have it redone at Yoons alterations in Coronado, along with the bringing in the pant waist (total from her $20 by the way).

I'm a business owner, and when my customers are unhappy, I do what I can to make it right.   They refused to correct their wrong measurements, and crappy alterations without charging more money.   Thats why this place is getting a 1 star review.
1.  Wrongly sized cheap suits for high prices with poor customer service...
but hey, at least I got a free tie for writing this Yelp review< /Review>

We had stewed fish and lamb pickled cabbage. It should be translated as pickled green mustard instead of pickled cabbage. The soup is very tasty. The fish and lamb are heavily marinated with starch, so the texture is very soft. The three delicacies steamed dumplings are a bit dry.
The tables and chairs are all covered with clothes giving a delicate atmosphere. There is a beautiful round shaped chandelier hanging over the ceiling. The plates are clean and the teas are hot. Overall it's a very welcoming place to be!<//Text>

My 2nd time here. Their beef "burrito" is their best dish IMO. The beef is cut thin but full of flavor; the wrap is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside; combined with the bean paste, cucumber, and cilantro it really is a wonder dish to behold.
Dry pot beef is very good as well. Beef is extremely tender. But because it is on par with similar dishes offer by other restaurant, it didn't wow me like their beef burrito did.
My first time there, we also ordered their signature eggplant dish. It was very oily, but very yummy. It's hard to imagine that they could turn a simple eggplant into a entire dish.
After eating there twice, I think that I may return for some beef burrito take out from time to time. And once in a while, I may come for a sit down meal.</review>

<text>Good flavor, quite authentic.
Generous portion and reasonable price.
Favorite dish is the five color appetizer salad with vegetables, shredded beef, shrimp and mung bean noodle, topped with tahini sauce mixed in mustard. (It's the last item in appetizer section)
Steamed fish with tofu is good for people conscious of the calories - light and healthy.
Ordered 4 dishes and ended up enough food for 2 people for 2 meals. Total bill is only around $60.

Will come back!< /text><username>Yingyin Shi<//username></record></dataset><record>

<Review>A newly open Chinese restaurant next to Ranch 99 locates in s de anza blvd. It's clean and nicely decorated inside. There are various selections on the menu. We three order lamb with pickle cabbages and vermicelli, beef brisket with tomato, pan fried flounder and sizzling lamb. All the dishes are so tasty with large portions!!! I instantly fall in love with this Chinese restaurant. The service is fast and good compared to other mediocre Chinese restaurants. It's a Tuesday night as well as a traditional festival of China but there are only three or four tables are taken. Weird. How come Chinese people don't like this restaurant? I will definitely bring my Chinese friends here again.</Review>< resp>

Really great place for stews!! Pro tip: they also give free refills on the soup if you ask! I also really like their buns ;) Their portion sizes are definitely fit for families, so bring a group to try and share more dishes!

They've recently updated their menu so it has more photos, which is great for ordering. They also have a really interesting cold bean-thread noodle dish, some spicy chili dishes, and walnut shrimp!

There's quite a bit of seating, although it can get pretty crowded during peak dinner hours.</Text>

Outstanding! Crispy sweet and sour pork taste fantastic. Small place with excellent service. Lots of authentic Northern Chinese style dishes. Steamed, boneless fish w/tofu is must dish! Lots of "spicy" dishes. An enjoyable experience and worth returning to this restaurant!</Text>

Nice and clean place. I was dining alone and ordered 五彩拉皮 and 酸菜肉絲麵. Both were beyond my expectation! The portion was huge so I packed half of the food home. My husband also tried the 五彩拉皮 which I brought home and was crazy about it! Lol Will definitely come back again to try other dishes.< /Review>

One of my families go to places for really good food. They are always crowded so make a reservation. But you want authentic, this is it. Only thing that I don’t give five stars is their XLB which is just OK. The meat inside is just a little too dense although the flavor still perfect.<//text>

<review>We ordered takeout on a Thursday night. We were missing the rice and a few dishes were leaking. Some things we ordered such as the chicken chow mein were better than others, but overall the food was simply "okay". Some things were too sour or bland; the chilli sauce they gave came in handy. Everything was in perfect portions for 2.<//review><pics>None</pics>< response>

This restaurant features several different styles of Chinese cuisine, such as Sichuan, Northern and Southern China, along with Taiwanese. While the food tasted good, it was a little on the carb-heavy side for me.</Review>

Once we finally got the waiter’s attention and ordered, food trickled out slowly, and so we ended up waiting 15 minutes for our last dish which they ended up forgetting entirely. We had to flag down a manager and ask about it, and instead of taking the dish off the bill they insisted on cooking it, which took even more time.

Most authentic Chinese cuisine in the neighborhood. The food tastes amazing. Especially for their specialties. I also like the 酸菜川白肉 and 东坡肘子 a lot, which should be in their specialties as well. And the price is very reasonable. Veggie for 12 usd and a big plate of meat for 16 usd. Personally I come here twice a week. Absolutely recommend it!</text>

<text>Food was average and pre-made. Fast food quality charged at premium price. Hard to tip as service was non existent but then they might think you don't tip enough. Still wondering why waitors force diners to pay tips when there is no service.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

We with my kids and my food came out first, I didn’t want to eat until they got there food; which took 20 min after mine. We ordered dim sum and were giving steamed pot stickers, they were terrible and tasted sour.< /Review>

<Text>4 stars for quick service and great prices! My fam and I were hungry and wanted some late night takeout, but apparently all Chinese restaurants close by 9pm on weekdays! This place was open and nearby so we decided to check it out, and although it was hard to understand them on the phone, they took our completely vegetarian order and got everything correct and we barely waited 5 minutes.

Mapo Tofu: Perfectly done, just a tad spicy! Would order it mild next time!
French Beans: A little salty for my taste, and oily, but super addicting!
Veg Chowmein: Like your standard chowmein! Done well!

Overall, I would definitely check this place out (possibly dine in next time)!< /Text><user>113612119569137580884< /user></record>

<Text>I called around multiple places but many places quoted for higher price with longer turnaround time. When I spoke to Steve, he gave me a good price (original part) and 15 minute fast turn around time. When I got there he looked at my phone and started working on it.<//Text><user>118027846693049551483< /user></record></dataset><record>

<review>Good factory service. It feels a little like you're entering Fort Knox when you get there - they check your ID and enter your car license plate number. When you leave they usually check your trunk. You have to drive past a stretch of loading docks, around another section of massive warehouse, and then look for the nondescript yellow railing by a small staircase. Then you have to ring a buzzer to have them open the door. Service turnaround on a pro model camcorder that had been dropped/damaged was about 2 weeks.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

People are really helpful, but this store is just for professional gear. NO CUSTOMER CAMERAS like A7 or A6000. For all customer products go to "2706 media center drive, L.A." = Sony Support.< /text>

< Review>
Great store, great employees. Checkout is normally at medium speed but another cashier is soon to show up to help others. A convenient location for those who can’t go to main stores. Although baskets and carts are gone, employees are kind enough to hold on to items so that we can browse more. Overall just a welcoming store to be in.</Review>

<Review>An older female employee (manager) I encountered on a Saturday night displayed unprofessionalism and had a highlyy
unpleasant demeanor when there was an issue involving my digital coupons , as they were not applying as I expected they should have. The cashier who rang me up called this  particular manager over to ask what can be done in regard to the issue. This manager then proceeded to tell me that there was nothing that could be done. No other option,  solution,  or alternative was offered as if to say, I had to pay the amount due that was over the amount I was willing to pay. I let that manager  know I was not willing to pay the higher than expected amount.  So she rolled her eyes and began to void the transaction while demonstrating an unprofessional attitude and obvious rude body language . I've seen this same manager have a bad attitude on a different occasion with a different customer about sumthn else as well. The other employers are great n never had problems with them having a bad altitude. This one ruined the rating for that store. I really try to avoid late night visits here on saturdays because of her.<//Review>< user>

Best store brand new so it looks pretty nice in from outside, the employees who attended me though had a really bad attitude. I guess you do get what you pay for.</review>

She always says something about couponers like gosh lady you work where they have a app that uas digital coupons so get mad at corporate not people trying to save 😁< /Review>< rate>

Concentra has provide great service from the first day I walked into to there Santa Ana, Ca. office on December 16th 2020. All there facilities are very clean on every visit, the patient rooms were clean and neat including the restroom.
The doctors were knowledgeable, helpful and caring to my needs. From start to finish I experienced a level 10 on service in professionalism & hospitality. If would recommend Concentra to everyone.< /Review>

<Review>The nurse in charge of my visit was awesome and super professionally kind. Funny lady and the doctor was thorough and took his time to ensure I didn’t have any questions unanswered. Wait was incredibly quick compared to the other Concentra I drove 30 minutes to. They even turned me away because of the time I showed up. Overall, my experience at this specific location was fast, thorough, informative and friendly!< /Review>< Rating>

Very friendly staff and informative. I needed to go in for a TB test but was informed I shouldn’t have one performed within 4 weeks of a COVID-19 vaccine, which I was supposed to get the following week. Very grateful they warned me!</Text>

Run from this place. The doctor here is the devil herself. She is terrible. No professionalism at all. I came here to see a therapist because I was stressed out a work and started getting a droop on the left side of my face and all the therapist did was say I was the problem. She did nothing for me. She is rude and unprofessional. Be asked to go to a different location. You will have the worst experience.<//review>

It was super easy and quick to get a checkup here. I had to take a physical exam for a job position and they signed me in very quickly. The clinic itself was very clean and social distancing measures were in place. You have to wear a mask. I don’t normally go to these types of clinics and it was my first time but I would happily recommend it.</Text>

<time>1610404434328< /time><review>Never go there for a work related injury unless you absolutely have to. I messed up my lower back and sprained my ankle from a trip over a torn stress mat. The doctor did not even exam my ankle.  Spent maybe 1 minute on exam for my lower back. Just took xrays, then gave me pain medications and said I must go back to work 8 hours a day. He had my medical history and asked me about my health and I told him that I have High Blood pressure and asthma.  When I got home I looked up the medication and it was contraindicated and should not use for people who have high blood pressure and not to use if you have asthma!!!
Had a second visit after I had worked one day. That night when I got home I was in so much pain that if felt like someone had beaten me up. At the second visit, I told him that I can't work until I have healed more. He said he can't authorize that and I said , "you are my doctor, of course you can!". He said no he can't because he works for the workers comp insurance company. And I said what about your hippocratic oath? He said there was nothing else he could do for me and that I had to go back to work that day. I gave up, losing any workers comp benefits and made an appointment with my own doctor.  All that I wanted to do was get correct treatment and have some time to heal. This man is not a doctor, he is bought and paid for by the workers comp insurance company.  One note, the front office staff was very nice and the physical therapist, Lok, was great.</review><pics>None</pics><username>Lori Rackliffe<//username><gmap_id>0x80dcd7539194c78b:0xfd44a819e1a9712a< /gmap_id>< user_id>

To Whomever This May Concern,
Yesterday (6/3/2020) I came into your Orange Concentra Urgent Care location for a private ECG to be faxed to my cardiologist. Not only did the MA not know how to put the leads on or work the machine, but she put my name as "Cynthia Robinson" after I spelled my name TWICE for her. She also managed to get my birthdate wrong after I said it TWICE, as well. She literally came stumbling into the room as well, and put the blood pressure cuff on incorrectly. From someone who struggles as an addict, I saw very similar behaviors from her. I don't know your facility's drug testing policies but it is something to strongly consider, regarding the behaviors she exhibited. I don't remember her name but she has put a significant damper in me getting necessary cardiology care.  I am very frustrated with the care I received here and will not be returning here ever again. I would like to have the MA or nurse who was on my case be reviewed by the manager or lead physician, if possible. I hope this never has to happen to another one of your patients.
EDIT:
I was able to speak with the billing department and customer service supervisor, and Deborah was very understanding. She was able to help me start the refund process so that I don't get charged for a service that was more harmful than helpful. Huge shout out to her!<//Review>

Concentra in Orange (on Tustin Avenue) often is so busy that there are not enough parking spaces for patients. The waiting room is cold and the bathrooms are not clean. I arrived at 10:15 for a 10:30 appointment with the psychologist. I wasn’t called back to a patient room until 11:05. I waited there until 11:55 to be seen for my 10:30 appointment. When I told this to the psychologist she replied that there had been three people scheduled to see her at the same time. At checkout, I asked the receptionist to please schedule me for the first appointment of the day, as I had been there over three hours. Her response: “Oh, yeah, it’s usually only two hours”. Why is this okay? An appointment should be for one person only. I shouldn’t be penalized by waiting because “all three people showed up” (as told to me by the receptionist).<//Text>

<Review>They postponed my appointment an hour at minimum because the physician left for no explanation, even though I had an appointment scheduled the day before. The staff was very unprofessional. They left me waiting in the room for over 10 minutes and I was sure I was one of the only people being seen. I was extremely dissatisfied with Concerta's service and professionalism.< /Review>< time>

I didn't have to wait to see the Dr. They called me back right away. The Dr was great he listened to me, really listened  and helped me to understand what was causing my pain. And when one exercise caused me pain he immediately switched up to another that didn't cause me pain. Thank you physical therapy department.</Review>< resp>

This is a great urgent care. I was pulled back to a room and to take my vitals within 10-15 minutes. The MA, I believe his name is Mario, was great. He was very upbeat and funny! The doctor was very nice as well. All in all, 5 stars for this urgent care.</Text>

The change to Concentra has been very difficult. It took forever to get permission to see the back specialist and when I finally got an appointment they didn't have my records. The specialist was great nd the workers did the best they could, but this is unsatisfactory. They had 2 weeks to send the records< /Text>

The only reason I chose to go to “Concentra,” is because I had a wonderful experience a few years ago when it was a US Healthworks. Well, front staff was nice, gentleman who took my vitals was very helpful & courteous, the doctor; epic fail! He did a substandard examination; I reiterated at least three times how being sick aggrevates my asthma. He did NOT listen to my lungs, did NOT check my inflamed gland in throat, only checked my ears, & tongue. This all transpired Monday, March 4th, because I stil felt like death warmed over I went to St. Joseph Friday, March 8, 2019. Dr. Taylor confirmed I had a sinus infection; prescribed me a ZPak, two inhalers & non-codeine cough medicine. That’s because he clearly takes his hipocratic oath seriously. Shame on the doctor at concentra!<//text>

<text>Very bad experience!  People in the front desk are just so rude and unprofessional.  I signed up in the list the girl told me to have a sit and wait, waited for 45 minutes until someone asked If I was helped. Until then they notice I had to fill out paper work so they gave me it after 45 minutes of waiting!!! After that I had to wait for another 30 minutes just for a vaccine! !! Bad bad bad!< /text>< Pics>

The last appointment I had here went terrible. After being examined the nurse told me to wait in my room until the dr comes in and tells me it’s ok to leave. My appointment was around 2:30pm I was done being seen around 3:30pm and I had to wait until 5:55pm and had still not been seen by the dr to be dismissed. I had to walk out to the receptionist myself and ask if I can leave and she said she thought I had already left and apologized for the wait. Nobody should have to wait at the clinic for 3 and a half hours.< /review>

He insisted that there was nothing wrong with my back. I went to another doctor and it was confirmed thru an MRI that I had a herniated disk. I was denied workers comp. based on Dr. Lester Guzman's report. If you ever get injured on the job, don't ever go to US Healthworks. It's just a low class industrial facility with no professional doctors. They are dishonest.</review>< Rate>

<Review>I always come laundry here but this time it looks like a new employee? Today, March 29,2021 at 4:55pm my daughter needed to use the restroom (pee) but the employee's excuse was that the toilet flood and there's no toilet paper, so my daughter couldn't hold it and had an accident in my car. Then while I was drying my clothes, I saw that she opened the restroom for someone's kid to pee!! I went in there, toilet flushed and worked perfectly fine, no flooding!! I'm in rage! If she's not going to open the restroom for my daughter what makes it right for her to open to other kids?<//Review><userid>105038499697355716085</userid>< Pics>

Same as the other location. Don't actually open at 6am. Have to wait for their staff to open at whenever they get there. Have to wait 20mins for someone to actually drove there and open the door. As you gussed, they opened at 6:20am. Your business is a joke...<//text>

The facility was clean and not to packed, but 75% of the people there were not wearing masks. Come on people social distance & wear masks. We're in the middle of a pandemic. This is why Fresno CA numbers keep going up at an alarming rate. I was very unhappy no staff was around to say anything.<//review>

<Text>my first and last trip to this place was a very unpleasant experience, the place was dirty, half the machines were down and the load capacity was a joke. and the "free dry" is laughable, i ran it 4 time (at 8 minutes each) on the highest heat and my clothes were still damp even though at the time i left they felt dry. this place is a joke. i will bot be coming back. there was staff on site and the place was an absolute mess.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Text>Its usually always clean including the bathroom  if you dont mind the homeless it's a cool spot I been going here for years my only problem is it sometimes full and it's a waiting games or a machine is broken but if you have a large family and need to wash a mountain of clothes they have two 8 loader which is super helpful or if you about that single life it's only 2.25 and free wash< /Text>< Pictures>

<Name>Cotton Candy Madness< /Name><Text>When I have gone here it is always busy. Too many people with too much laundry! They all take about 5-8 washers each and then they hog all the dryers. They even split up the loads. 1 washing machine = 3 dryers! Then they can hog the dryers and keep them for themselves. Half the dryers are always broken. So most of the time you are standing around waiting for dryers! Free sounds good but it's more of an inconvenience than anything. They should come up with a system where everyone gets the dryers when there loads are done washing. They should keep up on repairs so when the weekend comes up everything works! The lady that works there is great. I would never complain about someone who is doing so much for very little. She is attentive to all, but is stretched thin because so much is out of her control. She can't fix washers or dryers that break down, but she will use her own money to help you out when a machine eats up your money.

<text>They many loads to choose from. From your basic machine wash loads to an eight loader washer machine. They also have a big area of free dryers as well. No waiting for others to finish. I love this place. And I'll be coming back.< /text>< Time>

<review>Today I went there on time and usually you can wash before 9:45 pm and I guess they changed their policy. What I don’t understand is why say that you guys close at 10 pm but then stop customers from washing at 9 am ? What made me upset was the fact that I got there before 9 pm and sat there waiting for the big washer . I seen that it was available and the employee told me that they’re not taking anymore customer to wash after 9 pm .i told her that it has never been a problem for me and we were waiting the whole time for a available washer .all she had to say is well you can’t wash . I wouldn’t be upset if she said I’m sorry for the inconvenience or I’ll let you wash since there was a wait.  This had not happened just once but twice to me in the same location. As I put my stuff back in my vehicle I had went back in to return the laundry cart .i over heard her talk about me to other customers and I think her daughter was there. Very unprofessional.<//review><resp>{'time': 1554769875963, 'text': 'Hi Michelle, sorry to hear about your experience.  Our last wash policy has always been 9pm and we apologize if you were treated differently.  Please feel free to call our customer service line at (559)900-3559 if you need anything.

I started to go to an other laundry mat I notice that washing time is a little longer by 7 min to 10 depending on the size of the wash.  and it does 2 washing cycles when this one only does one and it has an option in adding a extra wash or spin or an additional 25cents to 50 if you choose both. Maybe you guys can upgrade to better washers.  This is a busy laundromat but cleaning has to be picked up a little more specially the bathrooms. Perhaps have the bathroom locked and have the lady in charge open it to customers only.  Also lots of people wash somewhere else and come for the free dry. I understand how scary it can be to confront these people because many are aggressive. ;/ .. Since the area is kinda of bad perhaps hire a security guard. I stopped going.  People go nuts over the free dry. Making it so hard to find dryers all the time.<//Text>

For the price is a decent hotel. Close to six flags, freeway and almost any store, fast food or chain restaurant is a 5 minute drive. Pool looks nice, we didn't use it. Night time security. Nice customer service. We had a corner double room, some high way noise but room felt spacious.< /text>

< Review>
came in for a dog show at fairgrounds.  I had 1 dog with me.  Very disappointed in that there was much solid dog waste in some areas not being picked up.  I reported to front desk.  There was  someone arguing in the parking lot one night at about 2:00a.m.  There was someone one with a boom box in vehicle both nights at about 1:00 or 2:00a.m. The towels are just less than nice. and dingy gray not real clean looking.  I bring my own.On the positive side, I am retired and stay at this motel 6 frequenty because it is usually more affordable than others in the area. An option for paid TV would be nice. Also it is very close to the show site. The girls at the front desk are extremely courteous and nice.</Review>

<Review>I am a many time repeat customer at several M6 properties and probably average 20-30 nights a year. This facility was a disappointment. The staff was fine but the room was not great at all. This room (#123) is a non-smoking room but had a sharp odor of Marijuana. The A/C worked but was very noisy on the high setting and barely adequate on low. It also looked like it was about to fall off the wall. The furniture was pretty beaten up and and had several burns (non smoking?) and the bedspread was smelly and had burn holes. In the bathroom there was no hand towel, one small scratchy bath towel (there are usually two) and the bath mat was dirty on one side. The "Pot" smell was much worse when the bathroom vent fan was running. This property was recently modernized but is already looking very worn. Honestly the M6 "Maritime" location is in better condition and the prices are lower. I feel that this property is overpriced given its condition.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Room was quiet (could hear a bit of the freeway sounds, but not bad).  No problem with anything, room clean and showers had good pressure and hot water.  In the past we have stayed in the Vallejo Motel 6 that was right next to the Cal Maritime campus, but that Motel 6 was bought by Cal Maritime and being turned into college residential hall.  This was our first time to stay at this Motel 6 near the fairgrounds.  It was in better shape than the Motel 6 near Cal Maritime.  The lady at the desk during check-out was friendly.< /text></record>

Just so Everyone knows, this place is now 'Red Roof Inn' so I'm sure the management is new and the place is possibly renovated... We just checked in, from off the Freeway,no reservations, got in quick, which is always a good thing... Room is Clean...
So far so good..... I'll up or down grade the Stars tomorrow upon checking out :}< /Review>

I suppose for the cost in relation to other motels in the area it is reasonable. The staff was friendly, just not well trained on front desk etiquette. They could clean the rooms better and provide better linens. There was cigarette holes in the sheets. And the floor made my bare feet turn black from being so dirty. The beds are hard as a rock. The pillows small. Comforter appeared as though it hadn't been washed in months. It was a busy weekend in June 2015, so it took forever to check in. There was no information on local eateries or events or maps... nothing. It's in a residential area, close to the freeway. Overall, not bad. For all the worry about the filthy accommodations, well, it's basically a step up from sleeping in your car.<//review>

Everything went smoothly except for people outside smoking leaked into the room a bit, nothing enough to disturb but mildly irritating is all. Rooms easily accessible and adequate parking with security was great. Quick access to few decent places to eat as well.< /Text>

It's decent. The grounds are kinda dirty, it could use a power wash on the walkways. The heater didn't heat up the room quickly and turns it self off. There wasn't a bathroom fan. There wasn't a blow dryer nor fridge. The price was good. You get what you pay for.<//Review>

<Review>Front desk staff were friendly & helpful. Reserved a room with a mini fridge but upon unloading the car & kids, realized our room didn't have one. Called front desk who fixed a different problem with my original reservation and was told she'd call back about the mini fridge. Never heard back from her and did fine without one. Next morning, upon check out, found out the room's fridge was taken out a few days prior to be fixed. Would've been nice to know that ahead of time but gladly accepted the $5 refund offer.
Room was spacious and better than what I was expecting for such a good price.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x8085732fa6f9ec5d:0x4bf3e39bdbbe5b40<//GmapID></record>

The first room  I got was a "non smoking" room but guess what it totally smelled like cigarettes,The staff was nice about it and gave me another room, the second room the bath tub had hairs like some one just trimmed their hair, and you can tell the tub was getting mold  on the sides and corners, the beds well they are OK but they can get better blankets! And around midnight it sounded like people where having a party outside next thing we know there was fight outside! Looks like people use this place for parties or some what!...</review>

However the receptionist was nice and offered to spray the room.  Declined her offer as she was trying her best and doubt it would be effective.  The TV provider was Dish and had 2 HBO channels which was unexpected.  Also rock bottom pricing of $70 compared to going rate of $100 makes it a bargain.</Review><gmapID>0x8085732fa6f9ec5d:0x4bf3e39bdbbe5b40</gmapID>< Rate>

I had to stay for a few nights due to visiting a family member in the hospital. The Motel was only a few minutes from the hospital. The rooms were clean and quiet, they had a good area to walk the dog, and front desk was cheerful and professional. Wifi for $4.99 was excellent for streaming video. Just remember to bring your own shampoo and hair dryer - they are not provided.<//text>

<review>Customer service was ok. The young lady at the front office was nice. The rooms were nice and clean. The only negatives were; the bathroom door we had to shut hard for it to close. The main door even though it was closed you could see the lighting from the outside. Overall it was good enough for the price I paid.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<username>Candice Duclos< /username><Date>1524515338779< /Date><Rate>1< /Rate><review>Was called late afternoon the day I was coming into town to be advised that they were putting us in a smoking room because that’s all they had. I was told my choices were to take it or cancel. After throwing a fit because I booked a non-smoking room and was coming some distance that day the girl said she could put me in a “suite” for no charge. This was after she told me there were no other rooms which is why I had to accept the smoking room.

Finally got there and settled in. Our room- which was non-smoking - smelt like weed because the awful neighbors had apparently hot boxed their room. Hotel employees at check in also smelled of weed. I was told that It was legal in CA and even though they didn’t allow it they had to put up with it. Yeah, that’s not what the law says - private property can say no weed. Frankly I could care less if you smoke weed but you don’t need to fill an entire hotel room so fully that it seeps into your neighbors.

As if that wasn’t bad enough we had some guy beating on our door at 12:30am repeatedly after trying our door. Thank god we had it locked. Turns out several lovely characters were running dope out of their room several doors down.

Never again! I stay in Motel 6s regularly while traveling for dog shows but this is one I will not return to. They turn a blind eye to all of the goings on, poorly manage their reservations and allow narcotics to be used and sold on the property despite “security” being on staff. Awful!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<resp>None</resp><Review>So we all know that Motel 6 is no 3 start hotel, but when I booked this particular one, I never expected it to be this bad. The room was worn down even thou it was "newly renovated"; all towels small, stained and falling apart; the bed had an old blanket on it that not only was stained but also covered in holes (cigarette burns in a non-smoking room) and the mattress was so loose it seemed like it was 20+ years old; we got woken up on a Saturday at 8 am by rude housekeeping; a great experience overall clearly!

I wasn't really expecting much, but somehow I underestimated their capacity to be this bad!</Review><rating>1</rating>< user_id>

<text>The entire room smelled strongly of mold. We weren't able to even shower because the smell was the strongest in the bathroom and we couldn't stand to be in there for more than a couple of minutes at a time. Also, there were a couple of big brown wolf spiders in the room. We woke up to one on the bed. The rest of the room was clean, though.<//text>< Pictures>

If I could leave negative stars I would. This is the last Motel 6 I will stay at. While the room was fairly clean, the grounds were disgusting. The entire place smelled of cigarettes and weed. The rooms smelled. Dogs defecated on the walk ways. I have stayed in Motel 6 all over the country and this one was by far the nastiest for the grounds. And one of the noisest. I have stayed at Motel 6 on the strip in Vegas and it was more quiet. It constantly sounded like someone was going to bust into our room.< /Text>

<review>I was very happy with my experience with this motel6.  Everyone was very very very accommodating. From Manager Ray to the women working with him in the check in to the cleaning ladies.  I look forward to starting here again. I have never stayed with motel 6 before. Never heard good things. But I was really happy my whole time here.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Do not book a room here. I repeat do not!! I have stayed at motel 6's all over the country and this one is by far the worst I have ever seen. The only reason I gave it a one star is because they refunded my money after we decided not to stay there. We arrived around 5:00 to make sure we were able to get a good room. The first room they gave us which was supposed to be non-smoking smelled overwhelmingly of marijuana and the bed had not been changed from the prior night. The second room which was also non- smoking had a very strong mold smell I could practically feel the spors in the air it was so strong. This room was also not clean. If you have allergies or kids I would not recommend staying here. The people that were staying there looked a little rough. Overall the hotel is not well kept inside or outside.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

< Review>
I had a great night. I was able to make a last-minute reservation at this location. Checking in, the staff were very sincere and helpful. I was actually upgraded to a suite, in fact. I came downstairs to ask if I could borrow a corkscrew to open a bottle of wine. They botch frantically looked, but were unable to find one. Nonetheless, they are great staff that I haven't seen the kind of customer service they provided in any other location. I would definitely revisit time and time again.< /Review>

The staff was friendly, but the room was a little dirty and reeked of smoke!!
The bed was made and appeared clean, but it looked like a cigarette had been put out on the headboard where it was attached to the wall. There was graffiti in the bathroom.
Upon check in the gal told us they were booked, so I didn’t ask for a new room.
The biggest complaint is the horrible smell of smoke. I woke up coughing and my clothes smelled the next day.
Everything else was satisfactory, but the horrible nights sleep and damage to my throat and lungs were terrible.
Shame on Motel 6. It was supposed to be a non smoking room.
I have pictures of the headboard and graffiti.< /text>

Nice room refurbished in the new style; door a bit sticky.  Shower was great--plenty of HOT water, and exhaust fan worked well to remove steam.  But a room facing away from the interstate would have been much quieter, I think--the whirr from wet tires on both trucks and cars wasn't as restful as one might think.< /Review>

<user_name>Fred Garland< /user_name><Review>arrived at 3:30 and told that the room was not ready despite reservation.  Told to return in an hour for the room.  Returned at 4:30 and told that room was not ready and come back in an hour.  Came back at 5:30 and the room was finally ready.  Finding a place to blow two hours after days of time to prepare was bad.
We paid for three days at the motel.  We decided to leave after two days.  We were charged over two hundred dollars for three days and than were only refunded just under fifty dollars.
Bad service and money fraud puts this motel at the bottom of my list.< /Review><Rate>2< /Rate><Date>1535211193875< /Date>< Resp>

Overall experience was ok for the price. One of the bed from the first room we were given was soaked in urine.  The manager and staff on shift were more than helpful and upgraded us to a suite.  The rooms could use a little renovation and atleast add a microwave and a mini fridge.  I'm not sure if it was only our toilet seat but it was small and not your standard size. I think that was our first and last stay in a motel6.</Text>

For it's location and within motel six standards I put it higher than most as far as flexible on late checkouts compassionate if have needs work with you if bank problem or payment issue and if booking made your late  for they will still make room for you it had great security that were helpful very accommodating.  All and all it was acceptably clean everything worked and they front desk was aproechable.<//review>

If I could give a half or no star I would! The bathroom had mold on the ceiling, and in between the dry wall and the tub, yhere were mold in different places of the room, the faucet for the water in the tub was detached, you couldn't get thr full effects of the shower cause there was water pouring out like we were taking a bath,  there were cigarette burns in the blankets and it reeked of cigarettes so bad ( like someone just finished smoking one before we got in there)there were holes in the wall,  we payed over 100 for a two bed room, and though the layout was very nice, each room had the same problem. We were left to find the room ourselves as the front desk lady told us " I work at different motel 6, our layout is different I don't really know where your room is at, I just know it's on the second floor." Overall not a 3 star hotel, I guess you can say we got what we paid for.  Won't be coming back! Excepted a very different experience seeing as the one in our hometown is a very good motel.< /text>

I stayed 5 days at this Motel 6 while I waited for my home to be remodeled. The property was very dirty. Trash piled up and overflowing. Left day and night. 1 towel in the room. A.C. was broken and 85 degrees in the room. I had to have my key redone 3 times a day and I kept them away from my phone and keys as instructed.

Free WiFi advertised but when I went to use it the fee was $2.99 and up.
I've always had good experiences at all the motel 6's I've stayed at and will continue because I always travel with my dog, but this was the absolute worst.

Locals stay here and deal in drugs and other criminal activities. For the price I was charged I could have stayed at a much better place. Also when I found out that construction was going for another week, the rates went from $70-104 a night. I ended up having to change to another motel 6 location so I wouldn't go over budget. Forcing me to leave early in the morning before work.

If this is a franchised location, they should be forced to leave because they are ruining the brand's name.

I am now at the Maritime location in Vallejo and they are clean, secure, and thankfully the A.C.<//Review>

<Text>Overall it was not a very good experience unfortunately. We reserved a non smoking room but the room had a terrible, very strong smoke odor. The main lamp on the desk didn’t work. The blankets on the bed smelt like rotting alcohol, giving us the impression they hadn’t been properly cleaned.
The staff was fine. I do not like to complain about things, but for whatever reason our stay in this room had many issues making it a uncomfortable night.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Probably the worst experience I’ve ever had at a motel. We went to six flags for the day and booked our room about 2 months in adnvance. We called them that morning to tell them we wouldn’t be checking in until 11 pm as we were at the park all day. They told us no problem. Half way through the day they call us to tell us that they lost our reservation and they were booked for the night. In a panic, we got in an argument with them about not having our room, so they upgraded us to a “suite”. We get there, the front desk staff is rude as can be, and the beds has cigarette burns all over them. And there was random toilet paper rolls everywhere. We’ve stayed here every time we go to the park, but will avoid. We didn’t feel safe at all. Worst experience, I’d avoid at all costs.< /review>

This is the worst motel 6 we have ever stayed in.  We made a reservation six weeks in advance and requested a ground floor for my disabled husband.  They didn't have it.  We requested an extra pillow for him.  They didn't have it.  The desk staff was rude.  The same trash was on the ground the entire time we stayed there.  The walkways, stairs and exterior was filthy.  The room was clean but the sink wouldn't drain.
This hotel was a disgrace.</Review>

I had the worst stay here ever in the history of hotels and motels. From the moment I arrived I should have left. 3, 3!!! domestic violence fights were happening throughout the night. The first one was right outside the lobby. The next one was right outside where we parked to go to our room. This man running out of his room half naked trying to get to this female in a taxi who stole his wallet. Obviously a prostitute. I had my two boys age 5 and 11. I had to hurry them into our room and blare the TV so they couldn't hear the commotion outside. As soon as we got into the room we were greeted with the strongest smoke smell. We asked for a non smoking room only. When I called the front desk she said it was the only room left and she could not move us. I was very disappointed. I cannot believe our stay up to that point was horrible. Then at 4:45am I woke up to the screams of a woman from the floor beneath us yelling for a man to get his hands off of her throat. I called the front desk because they kept throwing each other up against the wall. It was a horrible experience for me and my two young children.< /text>

I am very disappointed with Motel 6 lately. I spend about 60 nights per year there. The conditions at Vallejo are similar to most of the locations in California. they do not seem to understand that the amenities that they sell when they sell a room matter. No internet was the primary problem at Vallejo also only a few of the television channels worked. Combine that with a microwave that was so filthy I would not place any food in it whatsoever. Finally the Vallejo location seems to be a party location where rooms are rented for that specific purpose. I was there for 2 days and nights and was unable to sleep or get any work done. My previous stay was in Petaluma and it was even worse. I'm not sure if I'm going to use Motel 6 anymore. At this point I do feel some kind of a refund is due. Very disappointed.....< /Text>

This time the pool was gross. It was cloudy with hair and particles floating in the water. The water level was not at it's normal heights. When we got. Out o the water our bathing suit had. A foul smell and our skin broke out. The Jets we're not working to filter the pool. Being that the pool is the main reason I paid to rent a room I'm disappointed. But overall staff and room was great. Also our AC did not work.</Review>< UserId.>

<Text>I did not notice coffee like at other properties. Even though I did not have a handicapped room, it would hae been safer if there had been grab bar to get in and out of the shower. I was put off by the set of stairs to the office, though I did find access without stairs eventually.(a sign indicating easier access would be helpful). This is an older site and could use some TLC.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>By far the biggest dump of a motel 6 I’ve ever stayed in!! We must’ve been given a smoking room (312), because it smelled Soooo badly of cigarettes, even with windows open (they were open when we arrived). Speaking of windows, there weren’t even screens on the windows! The bathroom smelled like mold, the beds were hard as a rock, each bed had two completely flat pillows and burn holes from cigarettes on the top “blanket.” The AC in sounded like a cement mixer all night. Next time we go to Six Flags we’ll stay at the Marriott or drive to Fairfield for our hotel room.<//Review>< gmapID>

<Review>We have stayed at this location many times for dog shows at the fairgrounds and Six Flags. We like it enough to want to come back. We always request a bottom floor room and NEVER get it. This last time we were on the third floor. It was exhausting doing all those stairs. We have more shows next month and am considering using another hotel in the hope that we wont have to climb so many stairs. I know several of our dog show friends prefer the Motel 6 in Fairfield. We may switch but don't really want to because of the location.< /Review>< Resp>

<Review>Bullet hole in floor between beds, blood on walls, hookers in and out all night, rampant drug use and the non smoking room was a smoking room. Honestly scared for my wife and kid. Booked to stay for trip to six flags. Will not stay again. I figured it would be taking a chance but good god. Way worse than I thought it would be. 40 bucks a night tops for this hole. I cant belive you run an establishment this way and take people's  hard earned money. 100 bucks a night... smh!<//Review>< Pics>

I paid in advance during the reservation registration and they made me wait for 2 hours after the 3pm check in time because the room was not ready, I paid for the WiFi which had the worst reception ever it dropped every 5 minutes and last but not least the room had a musty smell impossible to ignore . I will definitely  think twice before booking another day at this location.< /Review>

You get what you pay for, know that going into it. At least it's clean and you don't feel like your stuff will get stolen. It's a bargain price if your looking for just a place to crash for cheap, then it's fine.</text>

<text>This Motel 6 was barely maintained. The furniture was dirty, banged up and mismatched. The air conditioner face was broken and barely stayed on. The back of the bathroom door was dirty and the shower had so much moldy caulking. The bed cover was dirty and stained. I realize that Motel 6 is meant to be economical but maintenance and cleanliness I feel is very important. We stayed because we had our little dog. The grounds were not landscaped and the dog mess was not cleaned. The garbage dumpster in the parking lot was overflowing and had old mattresses beside it. We were very disappointed.</text>< username>

Motel 6 is our favorite place to stay in whenever we go out of town. But this place is very dirty and the smell of the room is moldy, musty, you just don’t know exactly what it is but it was just unbelievable.  The towels have hairs on all of them and i think your laundry employees needs to wear hairnet when dealing with the linen and then one of our linen have a blood stain on it.  Then we can even step out of the room because the place smells like weed. I tried to use the microwave but it was very disgusting.  It seems like it hasn’t been clean for weeks.  I came back the next morning thingking it will be clean but nobody seems to be cleaning it.  The empty box of food that was on top of the microwave was still there the following day. This experience is just unbelievable. I would never go back to this location.<//text>

I will never stay at this motel again.  The front desk was extremely nice but the motel was gross.  There were bugs all throughout the motel room... killed about 10 during my one night stay.  The floor laminate was peeling up and smelled like something died in there.  The bedding was dirty and had burnt holes in them.<//Review>

ZERO STARS
OMG!! The most horrible motel experience ever. I was awaken by severe itching turned light on and saw BED BUGS on bedding and under mattress on box spring. I have over 10 bug bites and needed medical attention for swelling. Also discovered over 20 ROACHES behind head of bed. This place needs to be shut down and exterminated. I am traumatize  by this whole ordeal.<//Text>

Great place if you like filthy rooms, bugs, and pimps and their girls hanging outside. The room has been updated but not clean. The floors were disgusting! Mold in the bath/shower and the linens were raggedy. We were on vacation this past week when we received news my father in law passed so we had to cancel our plans and return home right away. Having a difficult time finding an affordable room while on the road, we settled for this roach motel. Unless you are desperate like we were, I'd look elsewhere. TIP FOR HOUSEKEEPING: Sweep and mop the floors once in awhile.  We usually leave a tip, but not this time. The room was gross!< /review>

I am compelled to let you know how the crew of M6 Fairgrounds are doing a good job.
The front desk clerks are exceptional.  The two Angelas are the best.  The African American Angela is very professional and helpful.  As well as a younger HIspanic Angela.  She helped me find a lost special pillow.
Keep up the good work.</text>

The motel's price, and its proximity to Napa and wine country was the reason I chose this location. The only good thing I can say about the place was that my room was clean. However, I didn't feel safe staying there, and ended up cancelling my last night there. Over the course of a few days, my fiancé and I witnessed numerous people doing drugs in the parking lot. Most often they would sit in their cars, and then pull out abruptly. I'm not sure whether or not they had reserved a room. We saw one car in particular that came back time and time again. We took pictures of 3 crack pipes that we found in the parking lot. The security guard needs to be more diligent in telling people who are sitting in their cars to leave. I definitely wouldn't stay there again.</Review>< Gmap_id>

While staying at the motel, the elevator wasn't working correctly.  My room mate is disabled.  As a result of the inconvenience we experienced, the hotel manager gave me a followup call and apologized for the inconvenience.  He also offered a Motel 6 certificate as a way to compensate us for the inconvenience.  He was very nice and helpful.  I really appreciate the follow-up call.</Review>

<Review>I wanted a smoking room, but could you use some Fabreeze. The smoke smell was extremely pungent. I was woken up at 8 am to power washing and the dirty water came inside and I had to use one of few clean towels that were there.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x8085732fa6f9ec5d:0x4bf3e39bdbbe5b40</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Not my best Motel 6 experience across the U.S. Room was very hot, air conditioning was not working, very loud. Also not the best location, only if you plan to visit the Six Flags Discovery Kingdom. Could not recommend if asked.</review>

<Text>The room was dirty! Everything either had cracks chips are just plain broken. Floor was so dusty it was slippery blanklets had holes...TV screen had a line down the center...caulking in shower was coming out. As I was checking in and out people were telling guest services about things in their room that was broken. Toilet wouldn't flush. For a location next to an amusement park I thought it would be a decent place to stay but boy was I wrong this place is trash. Never will stay here again nor will my family extremely dissatisfied with my whole experience. Out of the two ladies I
Dealt at guest service two were very rude very rude. As people came in letting them know problems in their room one of them was laughing and shaking her head and I ask her a question and was told she couldn't help because she was off? Or to busy? Not really sure what she said as she mumbled, didn't even make eye contact with me and just pointed her finger at the other lady. She was busy sorting papers for 15min. as the lines was out the door. She had a very bad attitude. I wish I could get my money back for the uncomfortable night I spent here but I'm sure this review will go in the toilet just like everything else at this motel 6.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

The tv worked well and the air/ heater worked well too, even though it looked pretty beat up. Friendly front desk. The rooms had the bare minimum. no extra roll of toilet paper. very small towels. There was a pink stain in the bathtub and a clump of pink hair on the floor. Horrible water pressure in my room. clogged drains in my moms room.<//Text>

< review>
Worse Motel 6 I have stayed at. I travel lot. I stayed here once a few days ago and found that just about everyone that stayed here smoked pot
You could smell it everywhere and see people right next to you smoking. Cops also came once with weapons drawn. Didn't stay outside to see what was going on. Thought it cod be a fluke stayed again last night. Got maybe 3 hours sleep before I called for help. Something was going on drug related next door. Cops ended up coming and taking away guy. One front desk girl was really nice. Night manager was not any help to print out my boarding pass like other Motel 6's. They will not put coffee out earlier than 6am because they said management win't let them. At other Motel 6's they will if they know you are goinh to work before 6am. Families DO NOT BRING YOUR FAMILY HERE. There are places close by for almost same price with no fear of life.<//review>

I found the staff to be very professional,  caring, and concerned about your experience at their motel. This made for an excellent stay at the motel because I felt like if anything went wrong, the staff would be there to assist me and make things right if I should need help. Of course I did not, which made the experience wonderful.< /text>

Since I've arrived. I didn't fell safe. The surroundings didn't look good. The reception didn't give good attitude during my check-in.
Hotel room wasn't a surprise compare to other Motel 6 rooms.
However, during the night we've heard shouts and talking several times.
Not to mention, Fire Alarm went off and 3 o'clock in the night and apparently it was some gangs making jokes did it.
BAD BAD - Don't waste your money here<//review>

<text>We left... didn't stay..   This place is so poorly maintained, I feel bad for the workers, they all were so helpful and work very hard.  Brianna Washington checked us in and was very kind.  The manager (?) a woman with very short blonde hair, was very accommodating when we left, I really did feel bad for her, but WOW, the room was so filthy, the grounds were bad, overall not so good. I was in property management for 16 years and have 2 Airbnb's...  you simply have to clean it up... it was not cheap??

I didn't post a review to slam your place, but more to say that the people were so nice and if an owner reads this, please take care of your investment and your people.. they both deserve better!

<text>My stay at the Motel 6, Vallejo, Ca was one of my most remembrances of all ,such stays ever. You see, as always everything and everyone were above any adverage motel stays.
Now, the most remarkable item, beyond any motel or hotel stays was a call 3 to 4 hours into my stay from the Motel 6, Vallejo, CA's management checking to make sure that everything was alright, and to let me know that they appreciated my choosing their motel. I was very, very impressed.  I will stay at that Motel 6 again.

The woman that was running the front desk when I checked out should be commended!
We had to call for TWO cabs because they were horrible (The cab companies, not her), but she stayed right on top of it and helped me feel like I was being taken care of and that she was with me on this.</text>

<review>First, this room smells like an ashtray and is supposed to be a non-smoking room. There are no amenities in here! No coffee, no iron, no blow dryer, not even an alarm clock. There is only one way in to the parking lot. Oh, there is a TV and a bible in the room...<//review></record>

<Review>We stayed 5 minutes. We got up to our room and first thing we see is a big burn hole in the very old thin blanket on the bed. It is a smoking room but that was just the Minor problem. I then look at the 2 pillows on the bed and they both have long hairs on them. 1 hair was brown and straight and the other pillow had a long black curly one.
Then I pull down the 1 bath towel and it also has hair on it.
Housekeeping comes up changes pillow cases and then spreads the towel out on the nasty burnt blanket on the bed, picks the hairs of the towel and throws them on the floor, folds the towel back up and walks over to bathroom area and puts the towel back for us to use.
Did I mention she put a glove on before doing any of this. She didn't even want to touch them and expected us to use them.
JUST WRONG!!!! Even if the room was free I wouldn't have stayed there :(</Review>< gmapID>

<review>The AC unit did not condition the room, felt constantly humid and stuffy, and the keys were constantly demagnetizing even when they were only in my jacket pocket while I walked to the car...frustrating because I had to regularly get them rekeyed.

Overall everything was satisfactory. However, very easy to hear other guests through the walls. Heater had broken connection and faucet stopper broke, but maintenance repaired quickly and satisfactorily. I was disappointed there is no longer an AARP discount nor a WiFi available for seniors. The room rate rose rapidly every night I was there Wednesday through Saturday. I booked months in advance and was told it was "demand"??< /Review>

<Review>Was supposed to be a 2 night stay but the reservation didnt go thru properly so went back to my room and found somebody in there and all my stuff was gone least they could have done was call and ask if i was coming back prior to removing my things from the room.
Then the next room they put me in had toilet issues and i had to get a plunger to be able to use the bathroom wasnt a good second night stay</Review>< Pictures>

I reserved a double (two beds) non-smoking and when I arrived they only had smoking rooms or a single bed. I've been staying at this site for over a decade, primarily for dog shows. I choose this one over the other local Motel 6s, largely because it does have an elevator. But this was pretty disappointing.

Other than that, it is what it is. But given the fact that its catching up in cost with other more expensive chains, they really need to up their game.< /text>

Places Rundown very dirty they're afraid to give you two towels for four people. Pool water is freezing. It was priced way over what it should be $99.00 a night,  dresser leg was falling off , we had bugs. They just want to charge hi and cut back on everything for service. the one good thing and only thing it's close to the Six Flags. Try another hotel<//text>

I reserved my rooms ahead and did not get the ones I wanted. I asked for front rooms on the bottom floor side by sibe non smoking. But when I checked in I got the rooms that where left over. I asked the lady at the front why my preferences of a room were ignored. She told me that it was not her fault. Getting to my room on the opposite side on the second floor I could smell nothing but  weed. As a truck driver I do not smoke. Because of overbooking the hotel I didn't say anything so I didn't get kicked out.<//review>

< Review>
Worst motel I have ever stayed at. Our non smoking room was labeled non smoking, but the previous tenant smoked in it to their hearts content. We asked for another room, but there were none. There was also no soap, not even for the bathroom sink. The sink also leaked on the floor when being used. The room was dirty and the motel grounds were even worse. Trash all over the place. No one seemed to care. I will never stay here again and will not refer anyone to stay there.</Review>

<Review>We stayed here because it was the lowest price in the area and we were visiting Six Flags Marine world.  When I called to confirm the room the guy (Parmjit) was very confused and ended up hanging up on me purposely. I actually had to call back and get a frustrated with him to get our room situation solved even with my confirmation number in hand. However, when we showed up at the woman (Tonya) at the front desk was very nice. I think I would have gone for a slightly more expensive place if I would have known what the room offered. We were also trying to find a place that accommodated dogs which  made it a better choice. However, if you stay here bringing everything from a blow dryer to an extra roll of toilet paper. Room cleanliness was also fairly poor and it looks as though people live here on a weekly and monthly basis as well. It does change the environment tremendously and was not super good for my two children. The surrounding area is a little rough as well, would definitely recommend locking your car doors (or just parking them where you could see them from your room) and not going out side by yourself after dark.</Review>< pics>

Check in took longer than usual and the clerk met the needs of a person who came after me before checking me in.  The first room key did not work so I had to either carry my bags back to the car or to the office to get a new key.  The room appeared clean and I fell asleep right away, but woke during the night to find that I was lying on a wet bed; since it was late and I tired, I just moved to the other side of the bed and reported it as I checked out.  Looking at the mattress the next morning, it looked like probably someone had tried to wash a red substance (blood?) out of the mattress but was only partially successful.  I do not see how the maid could have missed this if the sheets had indeed been changed.</Text>

It was filthy with dirty linens, food left in the refrigerator, hair in the shower, one used bar of soap, and the floor was so dirty, it stained my white socks from walking from the chair to the bed. Next morning the kids woke up with bites all over their bodies! And I found a BEDBUG in the bathroom!! Disgusted and will never return to that establishment!!!</Review>< Pictures>

Well it was really noisy in the morning but I do realize most of the people were families spending the time at Six Flags across the street. Twice I had people pounding on my door in the morning looking for people not in my room. The most annoying was someone from the cleaning staff who was looking for someone else employed there. She was pounding on lots of doors. Really?! Also a cockroach scattered when I picked up my jacket in the morning. Went through my baggage to make sure I wasn't bringing any home with me.</review>

<Review>I came there recently and they have the worse customer service I've experienced, I reserved a room for 2 nights and the first night I stayed they allowed my room to get booked, customers are always right and they treat there customers poorly. My family and another family i met were displaced because They did not accommodate neither of us with a room we asked for. They have the utmost poor business ethnic and the way the manager Ray and some of the employees treat the customers is wrong.</Review>< name>

Our room was perfect and customer service was well beyond their pay...it was nice that on a hot night they extended the pool hour for 30 minutes! I wish that microwaves and refridgerators along with coffee makers were in each room: even if it required a surcharge!!<//Text>

<Text>I stayed in room 230.  The smoke throughout the night while I was sleeping was so severe that I checked out at 8:30 am and went to my friend's room in 109.  My clothes all required cleaning from the stench.  I had previously been in the ER twice in the last two months for coughing related issues which at the time of my stay were more or less healed.  However, I woke up coughing and I am still having challenges with mucus a week later. I reported this to the front desk . She advised that the manager would call me back. To this day, I have never heard from him.  I have stayed at Motel 6 all my life and I always recommend motel 6 to my family and clients, and, in fact, the occupants of 109 (Mancha/Scolari), were long time friends of mine who have stayed twice in the past several months.

Additionally, there was no television in the master room and the heater was broken in that room as well.

I paid extra money for the queen suite so that I could have a guest.  The room was so bad that I talked to my guest in the parking lot for two hours instead.

Staff was extremely friendly.

I would like a refund for my stay.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

There are no refrigerators in the rooms and that wouldnt have been as big of a problem if the ice machine hadnt been broken... I asked for a pillow which they had but they were completely out of pillowcases, which is concerning for a motel. It was clean and functional, and safe but very noisy. Other guests slamming doors, you can hear people moaning, buses, and garbage trucks. Staff was kind and attentive at the desk.<//review>

< Review>
I have not stayed in a Motel 6 in a while but due to my husband being in a Rehabilitation program for a stroke I needed to find a hotel for over 2 weeks.  I booked this Motel 6 online and clicked the senior rate (assuming that being an AARP member was the requirement as I had experience doing before with other Motel 6 properties)

When I checked in I was told that wasn't true and I had to pay the regular rate plus a hidden $2 fee. This added $15 to the total bringing it up to $79. I also did not realize that shampoo was not provided which for $79 seems ridiculous.  I asked to talk to the manager in the morning and left my cell #.....he did not call me.

I feel that the website should better define what the senior rate is.  I have now given my business of 14 nights stay to Super 8.....I am paying less and getting much more space and amenities....microwave, refrigerator, breakfast.< /Review>

The place is terrible the night staff is the worst, the only good this long to come of this place is the new manager that works there, he is an older gentleman and was the best employee that worked there. This place don't off shampoo to guests, there is also not comforter on the bed, so it's a wool blanket and a white sheet. Like I said previously  the night staff, there were so rude and  unprofessional<//Review>

<date>1496863390045</date><rate>1<//rate><Review>I stayed for one night in the Vallejo, CA Fairgrounds Drive location.  As I arrived I was quickly checked in by a person that appeared kind of out of it.  She continued to answer phone calls during the check-in process and kept putting me off.  Finally I got to my room that had a horrible smell to it.  As I looked around the A/C unit didn't have a vent cover on it and the temperature adjustment dial had been broken off so that it was unchangeable.  The room was about 60 degrees when I entered.  Fortunately, I like the room cold so this was not so big a deal; I would just go out the front door when it got too cold.  Upon looking inside the open A/C unit I could see some type of mold growing inside; visible from every angle in the room.  My wife joked that if I got sick, then we would know where it came from.  I ended up throwing up all night and well into the morning following my departure from the motel.  There was only one towel for me to use, no tissues, the tub stopper was broken and just sitting on the side of the tub, and only one bar of soap sitting opened on the sink; none were in the bathroom at all.  I get that you are a discount motel chain, however, the rate that I got with you was only about $20 less than other offers I had for that night.  I don't expect too many "extras" when I stay at a discount motel, but I do expect that the room will at least be up to code.  I don't know if it was the A/C that got me sick, but I am not willing to take the chance again.  Upon check-out the same person that had helped me the day before was the one again at the desk.  She was out smoking a cigarette, was slurring her words, and just told me to leave the key card on the desk, presumably since she was busy doing something else.  I was not impressed with my stay and do not feel that the $20 I saved was worth it.  Add on top of that that I had to pay for internet that was free with a stay at the other place I feel that I made the wrong choice to stay at Motel 6.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

< review>
I was at the hospital and arrived at the hotel around 10:00pm. While checking in, one of my sister's​ called who was coming over to talk about my mother (who was just diagnosed with Cancer) and her condition.
1.) After I finished the complete checking in process, the clerk then tell's me there is no TV in my room and also that there's no visitors after 10:00pm and it was now 10:25pm. So I my sister wasn't able to come over to my room, not even for 30 minutes to an 1-hour to talk. There were things that we needed to discuss about my mother's Cancer that we couldn't do at the hospital.
*Why was a room put up for occupancy without a TV?
**Why was I not told about no TV in the room until after I paid and was completely checked in?
***Why is there no mention of no visitors after 10:00pm anywhere on your website or paperwork? This was a weekend day so I could understand 12:00 midnight, but not 10:00pm!
2.) I left to get something to eat and when I returned my key no longer worked so I had to walk back to the office twice and get it re-keyed​.
3.) I was awakened a little after 2:00am from a dog barking continually in one of the room's close to mine, which kept me up.
4.) I requested a non smoking room, which at check-in I confirmed with the clerk, but the room that I was given reeked of cigarette smoke.
*Because of the smoke smell in the room, I was so stuffed up that I left the hotel room at 3:30am and just slept in my car out in your parking lot. In the morning around 10:15am I went back into ​the room to take a shower and checked out.
****This was not a good stay at all****<//review>

The rooms were lackluster and lacking amenities (there IS a small TV) but don't go looking for a little refrigerator or coffee machine here.  The sheets were rough and the blankets thin.  Despite strategically placing the shower curtain to keep water in, both my friend and I ended up with inches of water on the floor we had to towel up after our showers.  But that said, we weren't expecting much when we had to book a Motel 6 out of necessity. All we needed was a bed and shower and we got that.  On the positive, housekeeping was diligent and would call us to see if we needed anything and the woman who worked the front desk was welcoming and friendly as could be as she was preparing to call the Vallejo PD to get an undesirable off the property.  The motel IS well lit and you feel relatively safe in a sketchy neighborhood.< /Review>

This place is horrid! Nothing like being glared at when u first walk in by there sketchy security guard! Got denied a room after having the reservation for weeks, due to every occupant not having a VALID ID! No where online did it say every occupant would need a Valid ID.. I brought that up & got treated like trash by the ghetto manager (who didn't know if to be more worried about going to have a smoke brake or getting some type of pain killer for her stomach problem) & the obvious owner on staff..!! Although it would be nice to save a couple buck & get some rest..! Save yourself the trouble or embarrassment & take your business down to a respectable place like Best Western!!< /Text>

<review>It was okay actually sleeping wise, but the rest was terrible. On the first day we found a cockroach, same on the second day. We also found hair in both the tubs, and were only given one TP per bathroom. The location didnt seem like the greatest place but nothing happened on that front. The beds were very stiff and there were little particles of something (wood, fabric, etc) on them. The redeeming factor was the great receptionist though I think her name was Keisha.< /review>< Date>

<review>Very loud. I think they cleaned the room above me twice a day, makes me worry about hourly rental.....constant moving of furniture, banging around. VERY loud with my door on the walkway, right by the pool and stairway. People yelling, splashing and screaming in the pool at 10 p.m. Service was good. Main problem causing lack of sleep was how loud everything was. People had no manners, yelling at each other on the walkway, loud music in their rooms.<//review>< Pics>

< Review>
Hello. Sorry but I don't normally give bad reviews but I feel I must. I went to the toilet and was lucky I didn't get "'caught short" as there were no spare rolls of toilet paper. Secondly, I went to take a shower in the morning and it didn''t work. The tap was coming out of the wall. There was also no fridge. I also couldn't connect to wifi. However, having a 24 security guard was comforting and your staff were excellent.</Review>

< review>
First, It was very scary staying at this place. there were drug addicts roaming the parking lots, even though i seen a security person these people were allowed to roam the parking. Second, the room was horrible. the A/C did not work at all, it was cooler outside but with my daughter with me i could not even think about opening the door to cool the room and the windows there do not open. Third the bed was lumpy and hurt our backs by the morning and i do understand that you cant expect much but come on i paid over $100. for this room..... Fourth the walls and doors were scraped up. I will never stay at this location again and i now question if i should continue to use " Motel 6" for our travels. i will be reporting this to Expedia, because i feel i shouldn't have to pay for this experience.<//review>

I stayed from Friday-sunday. I left Saturday for a little bit come back and I can't get in my room because.. someone put me as checked out. Early sunday morning at 8am one of the workers knocking at the door very loudly asking if im checking out . Check out is not until noon. Then workers were talking verly loud outside my door. So I was not satisfied at all this time. I like coming here this is were I relax and have time for myself.

The staff at the front desk was very rude and not helpful at all. The floor of our room was dirty and the air conditioner was missing it's face plate and barely worked. There was a loudspeaker message that played several times in the morning and was very disturbing. There was constant thumping from the room upstairs and things thrown from the upstairs windows. Definitely a dissapointing stay.< /Text>

<Review>Nasty,  My husband and I just stayed here over the weekend it was disgusting hairs in the bed pulled back the comforter black stained sheets went downstairs requested another room the other room had black stains and red stains which I'm assuming is old blood all over the sheets the bathroom had ashes in the shower never cleaned. They compensated half of the room. Then charged us 75 more dollars at midnight. We will never be back again I wish I could give this place negative 5 stars</Review>< pictures>

<text>The outside is clean but inside the room are nasty! The first room they gave me smh was nasty. There wasn't a comforter on the bed..the bottom part of the TV stand was melted, towels was dingy..so I had them switch me to another room..so when I went into the second room.it smelled like mold in the room. the towels was also dingy too. Bathroom had a loud fan.. bath tube was dingy and had mold or dirt in the cracks of the bath tube. The Head bored had dust on it you seen a lot of dust every where In the towel holder on the night stand. The next morning we started to see a lot of spiders on the floor near the bed and in the bathroom big spiders and baby spiders we killed like five..I was ready to go after that!!!..I felt like I  wasted my money nothing in that motel 6 was remodel like they say in the commercials and on the pictures..I feel like their charging to much for those nasty room..I understand $108 a night for a clean remodel room 4 star hotel.. but not where I stayed at. I will never again stay there..<//text>< user_name>

The only thing that really bothered me somehow is that absolutely nobody will give u a complete set of fresh towels...u can never get a friggin Face Towel! I tried Housekeeping as well as at the Front Desk. Unless u accept "service" every morning at ur 9:30am courtesy call or u specifically ask for Face Towels when trading in ur used towels for fresh ones, at any of the other times housekeeping will bang on ur door or March right in, asking u once again and again and sometimes again...as if they assume u changed ur mind if u declined "service" earlier that morning, but now that they've made sure ure definitely awake, and not somehow playing with the idea of sleeping in that day & understand that for any day of ur stay! Jus'Forgetaboutit! They really mean when they say "We make sure to leave the light on for u!" If u know what I mean...<//text>

The lights went off in the room.  I contacted the front desk and informed them of the situation.  The security came up and confirm the lights were off.  Then 10 minutes later they said they were moving me rooms and I should go downstairs to pick up the keys.  I refused and finally they sent the security with the key and then they informed us that they did not know where the room to check the circuits was and that's why we had to move rooms.  It seems to me that the employees should know these details at all times.  What would have happened if there was no room available to switch me to?</text>

This hotel is pretty rough. People sitting in their cars in the parking lot all night long, appearing to sell drugs. Lots of apparent prostitution as well. Smell of weed being smoked all night long over my 3 night stay. Very scary hotel. I’ve never felt I would be robbed in s hotel until I stayed here.</review>

<Review>we were very unhappy the room was dirty the sheets had not been changed in days they had loose dirt in the sheets. There was mold on the luggage rack and on the walls. The fire sprinklers were rusted and the fire alarm was outdated. There was a bullet hole in the floor and it was a dirty nasty room. my reservation had bee canceled when I arrived. So I was charged more at cheek in than I was told when I mad the reservation even though the room was held with a credit card and I called to let them know it would be a late arrival. The manager did agree to split the cost of the room the next day I would be more than happy to send pictures to corporate to support my clam. I was the assistant manager at a motel 6 in 1999 for 7 years and I am so disappointed to see what had happened to the chan. my hope is there are still nice motel 6 chains out there my review is only on the one I stayed at in Vallejo.<//Review><Name>Nicole Hickman<//Name><UserId.>113187227209426451487<//UserId.>< response>

<Text>Our hotel room had black mold growing the the bathroom and water coming down the wall from the room above. I went to the office to let them know I had a huge flood of water on the floor when we got to the hotel. She said she could give me a mop to clean it up myself. The smell of marijuana coming from the room below was awful and overall I was afraid to sleep. Couldnt take a shower as I was afriad of the mold. I asked for a different room and they said they didnt have one. I laft at 6 am with hardly any sleep because it was so upsetting as a over all.</Text>< Resp>

Com. There was mold on the walls and run in the bathroom. A broken window. Unfinished flooring. Trash stacked up in front of our door and mounds of it by the dumpster. Someone changing the oil or something on their car. Cob webs all over. Stuff on the ceilings and walls in the room. Was completely disgusted and was denied a refund so I could go somewhere else. Staff was rude. We just got season passes to six flags right by there and travel to go. Don't think I'll be starting there again. Very disappointed.</Text><user_name>Colt Waller</user_name>< user>

< review>
The front desk denied my guest access to my room, I'm not sure why but they said that she took a TV from her last room.  Regardless, my guest was not givin the chance to appeal managements decision to completely ban her from motel 6.  In conclusion, I spent a total of 15 min in the room and used 1 towel.  I asked for a full two night refund and they only gave me 1/2.  I was very disappointed.< /review>

Dirty. I don't think they ever cleaned the place. Non smoking room smelled like cigarettes. They gave us a third floor room even though we had a groggy three year old waking up from anesthesia. Long time motel 6 customer, may not be one any more.<//Text>

The location of the room was on the opposite side of the freeway the location is walking distance to six flags discovery kingdom. And two restaurants one right next door. The other by a gas station about 1/8th of a mile away.< /text><Date>1523590459242<//Date><rating>3<//rating></record>

< Review>
When making reservation we asked for a 2 bed downstairs smoking.
When we checked in there were no 2 bedroom downstairs.
My husband can't climb stairs due to his knees. We've stayed at this place many time and know they have a elevator but the last time we go stuck in it so we always ask for downstairs.
Well we got a downstairs room handicap but only 1bed. It was ok but the bed was very small.
The front desk girl was wonderful very nice & happy she told me next time to call the hot after booking the room thur the 800 number.< /Review>

This was the worst motel I have literally ever stayed in.  Absolutely no amenities at all.  They didn't include shampoo or coffee or anything.  The room itself was dirty.  The bible was vandalized in the room.  We couldn't even swim in the pool.  I recommend you pick somewhere else for your stay because this place was CRAP.</text>

I booked a non smoking and when I was checking in at 8 the lady said they have no non-smoking left, the manager comes out and says...it is not what the customer requested..we honor what we have. After looking thru the system he gives us a room which was out of service sue to paint job. He said it was just a paint on the bathroom door and I said I am ok. I go to my room to find out a broken AC, no towels, no toiletries and room was bad. The bed sheets were stained and dirty. I had to go to the feont desk ask for towels and clean sheets. I changed the bed myself and slept. Not to mention the door slamming, head board banging and loud people outside, I was not able to sleep all night.< /Text><gmapID>0x8085732fa6f9ec5d:0x4bf3e39bdbbe5b40</gmapID><name>akhil penupolu</name><Pics>None<//Pics>< time>

<review>We paid $161 for two nights which I'm super pleased with. We always stay here when we come to San Francisco from Redding about once every couple months. Clean and super basic. So if you need nothing more than a shower a bed and a tv this is the perfect place. Loved that check out time is noon as well. Neighbors were noisy but what do you expect. Nothing crazy just dogs barking as it's a pet friendly hotel. Overall is a nice basic hotel really close to gas stations and things as well< /review>< Pics>

<Review>I stay in this area for dog shows and frankly the pickings are slim! Ramada is AWFUL. Courtyard Marriott filled up 3.5 months before the event! Comfort Inn doesn't take dogs!
I asked for a first floor- nothing was cleaned when I checked in took a 2nd floor. There is VERY VERY little parking and you have to get there and stay to keep a spot close to your room. Shower pressure not good at all in my room on 2nd floor- could barely wash my hair. No blowdryer for hair. No complimentary shampoo or conditioner just soap. The room was over $100 per night! The room was okay cleanliness wise- not great- not bad!< /Review>< rate>

Stayed 4 days, terrible. I wouldnt recommend it. First, it smelled gross. Says no smoking but people smoked in there. Pool needs remodeling and it took us 20 minutes to find someone to be able to get some towels because there werent any by the pool. Then there isnt anything special about the rooms. Theres no hairdryer. Theres no coffee machine. Theres no shampoo or conditioner. They charge as much as the other hotels and they give you far less.
Staff there isnt any good either. Manager gives you attitude. She helped me check in and wasnt helpful. She looked like she was being forced to be at work.< /review>

<Review>WOW!!! THE WORST OF THE WORST!!!! If you are a drug addict high at the moment or completely drunk, you will fit righg in. If not, stay AWAY!!! We are on our road trip through Cali and have been staying in "6" past few nights. This one is super super BAD! Marijuana smell so strong everywhere, nasty rooms, dirty bed sheets, moldy smell in the room. Loudly barking dogs in some rooms. A/C barely works and is from the year the A/C was invented or older. You also feel like sleeping on race track and the cars on highway drive allllllll night.< /Review>< Rate>

He kept yelling for someone to come on and that went on for about a hour.  There was no clock or coffee maker, which would have been a plus.  I will most likely not use this place again.  They can leave a light on, but I won't b e back.</Review>< pictures>

<rate>2<//rate><text>Have stayed here a few times. The rooms differ from each other greatly in cleanliness & bathroom size.  Request a non smoking room every time yet always smell cigarettes   inside the room. Most times coming from the bathroom.
( wish I started keeping track of which rooms were 'better' than others.. )
I'll have to start with room 304. Although the room is the 'nicest' I've been in thus far it is above the the office & the laundry facilities. Cars pulling in and out  all night as well as the noise from the guest checking in is bothersome. And most likely you will have a cop follow you in if it's late night..obviously profiling! Which was a bit annoying.
The price for a night is ridiculous for the return. This is NOT a "you get what you pay for" motel. For the price you pay.. should least get you a true non smoking room & free Wi-Fi.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1447426331549, 'text': 'Teresa,\nThank you for posting your review.

There were so many police, drugs and prostitution here that I WOULD NEVER EVER STAY AT ANY MOTEL 6. They know that tourists come and put us in other areas that criminal activity doesn't happen as much. My opinion is that they allow criminal activity to occur because they are paying customers...so they truly do not have any standards nor ethics or they would stop allowing it. The police informed me to stay ANYWHERE but at the Motel 6s in the area. Sad...but the company only cares about money.
Oh ya...and paying for WiFi after being charged these high prices is ludicrous! Their rates are only slightly cheaper than a better hotel without the criminal activity!</text>

<time>1469737049697</time><review>The newly renovated rooms were just an ugly bright orange wall and a new bathroom sink.  Everything else was old - the beds, the linens, the furniture, etc.  We found a large cockroach in the bathroom. The room smelled like smoke although it was "smoke-free". There is no free wi-fi and no shampoo and conditioner is provided.  The bed was not comfortable and it was seemed small for a queen.  Stay somewhere else, this place is awful.<//review></record></dataset><record>

The restroom smelled like urine.  The heater/A/c smelled bad when turned on.  Towels were very small.  Walls and ceiling were dirty looking.  Felt unsafe in the parking lot and felt fortunate that my vehicle was not disturbed during the night.  Other then that I loved it.(not)  at 80 bucks a night I got ripped hard. I actually had to buy some sandals to take a shower because no way i was going to walk barefoot on that nasty floor.<//Text>

<text>One star, just for the staff: professionnal and understanding.
At first, we got a disgusting room WITH ROACHES. Then we were given a smoking room, which we didn't have a choice but to accept it (the last one left). Not only the bedroom smelt really bad but also everywhere was dirty (sheets, floor, walls)...
The neighborhood was loud and sleazy (we suspected hookers and dealers).
I definitly don't recommend this motel, not in that lifetime or an other! Worst motel experience ever! Run away and never ever think about staying there!<//text>< Pics>

You get what you pay for. And you get WiFI if you pay for that as well. Remember to bring your own shampoo and soap. Also bring a flash drive with movies on it because the TVs will read them.

It was very noisy outside during our stay. A lot of people conjugating outside our door. One person even knocked on our door looking for someone else. A lot of pot smell which is am not a fan of, but everyone else seems to think everyone is okay with it.<//Text>

When I showed up to check in I stood in the lobby for 10 min while she was on the phone complaining about another guest.  I used my debit card to make my reservation but I was going to pay cash, she never asked how I was paying just put it on the card.  Our non-smoking rooms smelled like Pot all night, there were dead bugs in one room and mold on the ceiling in the other. I asked for rooms next to each other and got rooms on different ends of the floor.  We will not be going back to this motel.<//review>

<text>Made my reservation 2 days ahead but once I came to check in I came around 4pm check in starts at 3pm yet I was told that I was going to have to wait because the room wouldn't be done until another 45 mins... This upsets me because if you know you have guest coming for a room it Should be ready when they arrive that's what making reservations is for! I said something similar to my mother who was with me and the lady at the desk heard me THEN she did a search and wow guess what took her only 2secs to do.. found a room just like we needed that was ready already because it wasn't used for a day or so.. the room is decent and actually alot of space I'll give it a thumbs up for that.. but disappointed they no longer have mini fridge or micowaves I<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

There were roaches in the rooms.  House keeping was a bit rash.  My overall experience was not the best.  When I called and complain ed about the roaches they said "Aren't you a guest? Because guests don't get to complain."</Text>

<text>Absolutely hated this place to start we asked for a non smoking room however we got a horrible smoking smelling room. There was cigarette holes in the comforters, 1 towel ONLY no wash cloths nothing when we had 2 adults and 3 kids, only a bar of soap, no shampoo or anything. When we called and asked for more towels she told us we had to come to the office clear on the other end of motel to get it. The lady when we checked in was so rude and they also quoted me a completely different price over the phone during my reservation,  but we were stuck here because everyone else was full. They said this place was newly renovated NO WAY they just slapped paint on the walls that's it. The shower curtain was nasty with mold also mold on the ceiling where shower is and they just painted it? Broken covers for the cable where someone could get hurt. Ok let's just say I would really reconsider staying at this place. They never gave me the wifi code. They dont even have fitted sheets. I went on feeling fine and now i feel like i smoked a pack for cigarettes my lungs hurt so bad from this room. I will NEVER stay here again.< /text>< pics>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>One of you site front staff needs to improve their work filed professional skills... i.e. Lady name Brianna is very rude and disrespectful to your guest, my self being one of. Not to mention she never greets any guest in a correct manner a pond checking inn or, out! And  her paints is always hanging off below her waitz.... Just not something a paying guest/ customer would like to see.
But I can say your on manager is very respectful and professional i notice he attempts to lead his staff in a working matter... But the most worst thing about this location Motel 6 is your lead head of housekeeping She is by far your worst employee at your locations at Motel 6 Fairgrounds and Motel 6 Enterprise Wy. This  employee is Very Very Very Rude., Never Professional, Never has Any Rpom Service like Clean Sheets or Towels, Soaps ect. For your guest and their families. And l she also acks respect for her supervisor Authority.  By disregarding direct direction of site manager.</Text>< pics>

The motel had a bad smell. The bathroom was not appealing and needs to be redone. A hole on the new laminate floor needs to be patched. The beds were not comfortable and had lumps. The room needs to be repainted. The price for that room was not deserving.</text>

The roach rats motel!!! The showers aren't cleaned good. The blankets are old worn full of holes and the HOUSEKEEPERS steal ANYTHING they think you won't miss!!!  They fake like they don't speak English. All I know is they stole plenty from me shoes hygiene and loose change. Mike the owner is fair but the quality isn't their.
UPGRADE NEEDED BADLY..
TOO ALL YOU THIEVING AXX BXXXXXX AT MOTEL 6 ON FAIRGROUNDS ONE DAY YOU WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR STEALING THE GUEST BELONGINGS.<//review>

Worst night ever! I've stayed in other Motel 6 that were perfectly nice but this was was horrible! There are people calling your room at 4 am asking for drugs, people pounding on doors screaming, and cops show up at all times.

Do not stay here! Its better to pay a bit more and get a goodnight sleep!< /Text>

This M6 has plenty of rooms to choose from, the location is close to shopping, restaurants and a major freeway, and the staff are always helpful and courteous.  An issue for me is the water pressure reducers on the sink faucets produce sprays that don't provide sufficient water volume.<//Review>

The most disgusting place i have ever had the misfortunation of staying at.  Filthy everything, non working airconditioner, the made the room humid with sweat dripping down the walls.  There was mildew growth  throughout the room.  I have photos to prove the filth.  We left the room after a couple hours secondary to heakth risks.  We are disputing the charges with our credit card company and expect a full refund from Motel 6.</Text>

Was surprised to find no carpet in room.it was raining and floor was cold.snack machine didnt work and the fact that every adult in room had to show i.d.is pathetic.why punish the good people with this lame inconvienance .ehat about privacy.i understand the room number is to not be said out loud by your front desk people .thats cool safety for guest location .but any adult needs id .we traveled a distance to be told my traveling partener could not stay because of no id..she doesnt carryit .and thsts her busssines.she stayed anyway but itwas nerve racking.not noing if at any time we would be kicked out.had to sneek yt? o and from car .we didnt do anything wrong to your hotell somebody y must of .punish ish them with third degree not the inocent.however the front desk worker was more than nice and helpfull and the only real comfort dureing this stay was her smile<//review>

<review>I was looking for a place for the night, came across the location @Discovery Kingdom Motel 6.  Reservation confirmation received.  I check in, go grab something to eat and prepared for a soak.  As I am sitting in the tub, a visitor creeps by....A deformed cockroach... Smh.  I shoo him away...Far too tired at this point.
I get ready for bed and pull back the sheet only to find what appeared to be a public hair....Smh.  OK, so I am now calling the front desk.  I report the roach and the hair.   I request to have my sheets changed. Really, too tired to switch rooms at this point.  The desk clerk offers to see if hskping is still around...Since she made such a distinction, I inquired as to what if housekeeping is not around?  Her suggestion was that I would change the sheets myself.....TF I will!  So I asked if I could just change rooms? It's beginning to be too much, and to suggest that I pay to stay and work here on top of that....So the clerk reiterated that she would check.  Housekeeping did arrive a short time later and changed the sheets.  The cockroach situation was never addressed.  The next morning, I go to the bathroom and some gross liquid dripped down from some vent in the bathroom.
Oh, I forgotten about this, when I initially checked in, I called down to the desk to report that the comfort (er, very light, heat didn't work...Smh) had significant burn marks for which I didn't want to be charged....I spoke with Lena, or so she said was her name.  I will never go to another Motel 6 in life.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

The room was clean, however, the mattress has a couple of bad spots on it.  Also, the top of the air conditioning was missing. It seems these are relatively minor to fix, so don't know why they don't fix it.< /Review>

Cockroach infestation in room, cigarette burns and stains in orange bedcover, no shampoo or conditioner. Super sketchy people coming in and out of rooms until early hours in the morning. People smoking in hallways. Scary experience, front desk person was apologetic and gave me a $25 discount, but I got in late driving from LA and it was too late to find another place. Avoid at all costs - Still wasn't worth the NET $43 cost.<//text>

<Review>While the staff and evronment were friendly (the only reason I'm giving this place more than 1 star), the previous occupants either had a nosebleed or a fight, or something.....b/c there was dried blood drops on the floor leading to one of the beds to the restroom that the cleaning people somehow missed. EEEEEWWWWW!!!

That, and when my mom made the reservation, she SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED a NON-SMOKING ROOM....and guess what? We were given a smoking room. We didn't realise it until we opened the door to the room. Sadly, I felt it was too late to say anything. We had to sleep with the windows open just to air it out so we could sleep.

Not to mention that the price we were quoted was different than what we actually paid.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Worst stay in hotel ever. Lady up front was rude I dont know her name but was a young east indian girl. The beds dipped in the middle very badly.  Crazy guy banged on door at like 4am. I didmt answer but called front desk she acted as if this was the norm.  Meanwhile my kids and I were scared to leave room at 8am. The carpet was very dirty. Location is key also even tho only a mile from six flags u will notice the area is way different and getto.  I will pay 3 times the amount and stay somewhere nicer next time with cleaner rooms and nicer staff ect.<//Review>

As with most Motel 6's the room is just ok.  The problem with this one in Vallejo is the housekeeping.  They don't clean, don't make the bed and don't place the towels in the towel area, they place them wherever they want.  The housekeeping staff calls early every morning to wake you up and ask if you need anything!  There were no towels in the room when I checked in so I called to ask for some.  They brought me a washcloth only, I had to tell them I needed ALL the towels.  They haven't brought soap, shampoo or anything.  This is THE WORST Motel 6 I have ever stayed with and would advise that you choose any other motel in the area, and there are many.  Avoid the Vallejo Motel 6 next to Six Flags at all cost!< /Review>

The entire motel smelt of marijuana, which is very upsetting when you are traveling with a five year old. The room was filthy, my sons ball went under the bed and I left it there because it was now covered with dirt and hair. The bath tub was covered in hair and the tub wouldn't drain. The windows hadn't been washed in months< /text>

The recepcionist was kinda rude, she asked me to pay $7 extra dollars for my companion, even though the room includes up to 2 adults and one child, there were noises upstairs and the freeway is so close that you can actually hear the car noises, they don't have microwave and there's no fridge, I wouldn't recommend this motel.</text>

Stay away! Bed bugs, poor housekeeping, rooms smell horrible</text>
<pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1519155742765, 'text': 'Dear Guest, We take bed bugs reports very seriously and sincerely apologize for your experience. Please know that we are on high alert regarding this issue and are mindful to monitor our rooms in order to address, treat and terminate any issues if we discover them. We have designed a thorough and strict procedure to address all complaints or potential issues within our hotel. Unfortunately, bed bugs are a world-wide problem and present a unique challenge due to their highly transient nature, traveling easily in luggage and clothing. This is why we continually train our housekeeping staff to proactively monitor all guest rooms for the potential presence of bed bugs and have standing contracts with professional exterminators to treat affected areas in case any are discovered on our premises. No room gets released until we have an all-clear from them. Please contact our guest relations department at 1-855-787-9864 to better address this situation. Thank you again for bringing this issue to our attention.'}<//Response>< Gmap_id>

I wish I could give this hotel 0 stars.  It should be called hobo hotel.  Drug dealers and pot smoke is a given at this place.  I would rather sleep in my vehicle than stay here again.< /review>

Staff was friendly but for $300 for 3 nights I expected more! People around me were sketchy, the rooms smelled bad and to top it all off I found a cockroach in our room! Just a bad environment and will never recommend this hotel to anyone!</Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) We slept in our room for one night, double room on the ground floor. It wasn't great value for money because we got better rooms for a cheaper price (Motel 6). There was a TV in the room. The hygiene wasn't great, the bed was probably not changed, crumpled and sometimes hair was lying around. In the bathroom as well, especially on the towels there was hair. We were so glad we had our own towels. We wouldn't sleep there any more. Pity!

(Original)
Wir haben für eine Nacht in unserem Zimmer geschlafen, Doppelbettzimmer im Erdgeschoss. Preis-Leistungsverhältnis war es nicht so toll, da haben wir schon bessere Zimmer für einen günstigeren Preis bekommen (Motel 6). Es gab einen Fernseher im Zimmer. Die Hygiene war nicht so toll, das Bett wurde vermutlich nicht neu gewechselt, zerknittert und teilweise lagen Haare herum. Im Bad genauso, besonders an den Handtücher waren Haare. Wir waren so froh, dass wir eigene Handtücher dabei hatten. Schlafen würden wir nicht mehr dort. Schade!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) One of the most terrible hotels that I had to visit. The bed is dirty, the rooms are poorly cleaned. no refrigerator. there are no disposable shampoos, the road with access to the track is very noisy.
The Internet is not detected, a bad network, but I had to pay $ 3 for it - they simply gave them money for non-working Internet.
Fena, no iron.
Breakfast is not included, only coffee in the morning, but even scary to consume it.
The mood is spoiled.
I will not recommend it to my friends for sure. It is a pity that the booking did not indicate the real situation. For a cost of less than $ 85, living in motels is much better than this terrible hole.

(Original)
Один из самых ужасных отелей, что пришлось побывать. Постельное грязное, комнаты плохо убраны. холодильника нету. одноразовых шампуни нету, дорога с выходом на трассу, очень шумно.
Интернет не обнаруживается, плохая сеть, но пришлось за него заплатить 3$ - просто отдали деньги им за нерабочий интернет.
Фена, утюга нету.
Завтраки не включены, только кофе с утра, но даже страшно его употреблять.
Настроение испорчено.
Не буду рекомендовать своим знакомым это уж точно. Жаль что на букинге не указали реальную обстановку. За стоимость меньшую чем 85$ жили в мотелях намного лучше, чем это ужасная дыра.< /review>

My room was very clean and big enough. Only the air conditioning was completely out of date.

(Translated by Google) The only problem is that a roll of toilet paper was clogging the flush of the water. And I could not find it. I had never used those toilets. I called the office and they checked and when I came back in the evening they had already moved the roll and you could look at it. the flush.

(Original)
El único problema es que un rollo de papel de baño estaba tapando el flush del agua.Y no podía encontrarlo.Nunca había usado esos baños.Avise a la oficina y chequearon y cuando regrese en la noche ya habían movido el rollo y se pudo mirar el flush.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Dirty towels and bed linen, very noisy at night (due to guests and road nearby), the most unpleasant motel during a 10 day trip to California.

(Translated by Google) I am a regular customer, and the services are unstable, sometimes they charge me more and sometimes less. I asked why? And they told me that prices vary, depending on the day.
