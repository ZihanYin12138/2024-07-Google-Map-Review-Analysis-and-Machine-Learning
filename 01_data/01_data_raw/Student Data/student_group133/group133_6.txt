Staff is always friendly and they keep the gym clean. The members are nice and courteous and are always willing to help if you ask. The route get reset every couple of weeks or so.< /text>

I love all the Hangar 18 gyms! This one is bouldering only, which is great for me. It's so nice to have variety in the IE when it comes to climbing. Sometimes they have events, which is super fun. Their prices are so much better than other gyms in southern California. Right now, membership is only $36 a month! It's a terrific workout, and bouldering has helped get me in the best shape of my life. And... It's fun for big kids too.< /review>

This place is great. It's hidden away in the industrial area of the city. Parking is readily available even when it's busy.

Whenever I go to this gym it's hardly ever busy and that's great. The people I see eat the gym are regulars. Everyone is nice and encouraging they help you when you are stuck on a problem.

When the gym is busy there's still enough space to have a great time.

The staff at this gym is the best always friendly and helpful.</text>

The routes are changed out pretty regularly, so there is always new and interesting routes to try.
The music is always good and the staff are very nice and welcoming.  Full disclosure I am a Hangar18 gym member and this is my local gym.</review></record>

<Text>My local climbing gym where I first learned how to climb. This gym is bouldering only and contains mostly vertical walls. Easy to access with plenty of parking in an uncrowded complex. It can get a little busy during peak hours, especially Thursday night after the weekly section reset.<//Text>< GmapID>

Staff is whack. We were told at the upland location that if a guest using a guest pass subscribed that day for monthly, we would get the guest pass back. Me and my friend tried to explain to the staff here that our friend had gotten a month through his guest pass when we took him, and they didnt let us use it again though we were supposed to be able to. Instead of looking into it or helping at all, the guy who we waited over 10 mins for to help us just said "you can pay full price or leave" Go to upland.<//text>

<review>This worst experience ever! The manager Ethan is useless and have no experience as manager. I visited location one time with a Groupon coupon and now I’m a member? Being charged every month when I had no idea ! Be aware do not sign up for the $5 deal for an additional 30 days . They will sign you up for a member and charge your account $$$$$ every month . Once you call Ethan and try to get a refund he will over talk you out the phone and won’t let you get a word in . THE WORST Experience ever!!!!!

So far my favorite climbing gym. If you want to boulder this is the place to go. They change the routes often and everyone is quite friendly. No top rope here just bouldering.<//Review>

My usual spot is Hangar Mission Viejo when I'm in school, but this place definitely does the job.  A lot more of the routes here are designed for taller folks, making it harder for shorter folks (like myself) to perform static moves.</text>

Love this place and I miss it since I've moved away from the IE. It can get crowded since it's a little smaller, but everyone is really friendly. Just a FYI, but is bouldering only. They change it up often though!<//text>

< Review>
Victoria is AMAZING!!! She is a true professional and artist. It was my first time doing anything ever to my eyebrows and I was definitely nervous about the whole procedure. I am so glad I made the decision to go to Victoria. If you’re considering microblading, look no further! Victoria is your girl. She is the master at this!!!  I will definitely be coming back!</Review>

I was nervous at first but she made me feel comfortable and I trust her. I also let her student work on me and Victoria was right there to guide! She’s amazing what she does.<//Text>< pics>

I have went to numerous people trying to see if they were able to salvage what previous artists did to my mother but yet no one was able to. Victoria was the only one with enough experience to know what was needed in order to make my mother’s eyebrows perfect again. Once she saw the pictures of my mom’s eyebrows, she knew that she needed color correction initially to lighten the previous work that has faded significantly. From then she was able to lighten the old color and start doing her magic. The technique she used was the micro shading and she was able to get the natural looking hair strokes which we wanted. Victoria is very professional. She takes time to explain the whole procedure and what she does with her clients. Will definitely be going back to Victoria.</Review>< Pics>

Victoria is as good as everyone says. She was gentle, explained every step of the way, and got my eyebrows done pretty fast. I expected to be there for hours but she was very efficient (in a good way! I did not want to be there for hours on end). My eyebrows came out looking amazing! It was an awesome experience. Thanks Victoria for being so thorough and gentle. I'll definitely be back for touch ups!</Text>

<review>Victoria did an AMAZING job on my brows! They look even better than I thought they could! I previously had my brows done by a different salon and wasn’t really happy with the results. Victoria was able to neutralize the gray left behind from the “other guys” and fixed the unevenness resulting in beautiful brows that far exceeded my expectations! She’s did a couple of my friends brows too so In addition to her great reviews I got to see her work firsthand, their brows look flawless too! I felt super safe in her salon, she took all the Covid precautions. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend Victoria Brows!!!!!!<//review>< Pictures>

I asked her to change the placement before she microbladed them on and she refused, insisting that I “trust her”. Big mistake.  I had to pay someone else $600 to remove them. Victoria refused to refund my money! Avoid at all costs!< /review>< Pictures>

<review>Victoria did a phenomenal job! From our first interaction she was very professional and responsive to my questions. At my consultation she addressed my concerns regarding my sparse eyebrows and skin issues. On the day of my appointment I had some hesitation (this is going on my face after all) but after arriving and discussing the procedure again with Victoria I knew this was the best choice for me. Not only is her suite very chic it’s very clean and sanitary! I love my eyebrows and wish I had taken this leap sooner! She has contacted me since the procedure to just check on the healing process, professional and awesome customer service. Thank you for the confidence boost, Victoria!</review></record>

<review>I’ve been to different micro blading services  in OC. This is the best. Victoria is very good with her hands. Excellent customer service

I keep coming back years after years because I trust Victoria. She gave me the best eyebrow at the most affordable price. A true artist as she’s. I’m thinking having my lips done with Victoria also. With her, I can have the best of the best. I can’t say thank you enough 😊< /review><user_id>107024667505579911189< /user_id>< Gmap_id>

<text>I love...Love...LOVE my new brows!  Victoria knows EXACTLY what she's doing.  She's highly skilled and has a nice, relaxing, impeccably clean studio.  She doesn't just "eyeball" your face, either.  She uses calibration/measuring tools to make sure your brows are symmetrical.  This is important because I've had my brows done "freestyle" in the past where they didn't match.  For the first time, my brows match--a tribute to Victoria's careful, painstaking work.  Thank you, Victoria.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>Victoria literally saved my entire existence😄 my eyebrows are literally BOMB. Had so many compliments already in a week. I also go to makeup school and it is absolutely amazing to wake up with perfectly shaped ones. I was terrified at first since it is permanent.. so research was necessary. If you want good brows, go to Victoria. She recommended what looked good on me and also listened to how I wanted it to be. She made sure everything was perfect from begginning to end.. checked it very thoroughly and literally made sure I got my money's worth. Girl, thank you.❤<//Review>< pictures>

Run, don't walk, to Victoria.  She is absolutely AMAZING.  Incredibly meticulous, professional, and artistic--and accessible.  It's hard to find such a combination.  I had my eyebrows done once before...and was happy with them.  There is no comparison, though, with Victoria.  I am moving, but plan to come back here to have her maintain my brows.  They're beautiful!<//Review>

Victoria is an Artist! I went to her last month for my eyebrows. She explained everything clearly before the actual procedure. Her studio is very clean and she use everything disposable. Yesterday i cam back for my 4 weeks touch-up and they definitely look amazing! Before i went to her i already checked out some other places but nothing can compare with her work and her service. She's the only one to have 5 stars on Google and she's the top one on Yelp! If you want to get your eyebrows,  lips or eyeliner done. Please go to her you won't be regretted.</review>

I’m so happy! Love, love how my brows are turning out. I did the ombré brow & I needed color correction as well. Trust Victoria if she says you need color correction. She sees what we don’t. You will understand once she makes you have your perfect brows! Brows really do make the face. Victoria is quite skilled & busy. She will try really hard to get you in. I really appreciate that.
Excited to see you again sweet Victoria😁</review>

My wife went to Victoria to get her eyebrows done and was blown away with how great a job she did.  She ended up going  back to get her lips and eyeliner done as well.  She is immaculately clean and goes out of her way to ensure that you are comfortable and that you see that everything is completely sanitary and perfect.  The results were so good that my mother in law is now going to her to get her eyebrows done as well.  She is now a client for life.</Review>

I was a little apprehensive about getting my eyebrows microbladed since I have never done it before and wasn’t sure if I would be happy with the results. But the moment I step foot inside Victoria’s studio I felt comfortable and confident in her craft. She was very friendly, calm, and professional. Her studio and all the tools she uses is very clean and tidy. She truly is an artist and very good at her craft. She knew exactly which eyebrow shape and color would look on my round facial structure. I am pleased with my microbladed eyebrows and can’t wait for them to be fully healed!</text>

<Text>Victoria did an incredible job on my brows. This was a first time for me to get my brows microbladed and it was so fast and easy. She explained everything and was meticulous to make sure my brows came out perfectly. I will definitely go back to get touch ups with Victoria and only wish I had done it sooner!</Text>< pics>

I had my eyebrows microbladed by Victoria and it was the best experience! She told me each step of the process both before, during and after the procedure. She matched my color perfectly (knew immediately what color I was)! She was kind, spoke softly and was very thorough. The best quality about her was her perfectionism. Making sure the outline was done to my liking and appropriate to my face. She told me exactly how things would feel. She worked quickly, but very focused and methodically. The whole experience was amazing and I left there with eyebrows that brought me back to feeling young and beautiful! I'm excited to go back for my touch up and see the final results! Thank you Victoria<//review>

Victoria’s microblading skills are amazing and super professional. I showed up today for my touch up appointment and my eyebrows look exactly like how I wanted them since the very first session. Such a relieve not having to keep drawing or filling them in every morning or feeling embarrassed of going for a swim and having my self drawn in eyebrows wash off. I’m not kidding when I say this, if you haven’t tried microblading before and are in serious need of eyebrows go to her. She will try the best of her ability to shape them the way you want them. Feeling pretty and confident! :)</Review>

<name>Cindy wu<//name><response>None<//response><rating>5<//rating><text>I went to Victoria after months of research online and yelp about Microblading Eyebrows and Permanent Makeup.  I was skeptical at first because this is something new and not sure permanent makeup was right for me.  After the initial consultation I decided to get it done.   The studio was small but very clean and cute.  Victoria was very professional and spent half an hour make sure numbing cream was working and also spent an hour just to get the shape right.  The total procedure took about 2 hours.  The price was consider a bargain consider Victoria experience and upscale facility. The result came out amazing. The hair stroke look so real. I love the shape and color.  I am supper happy.    I get to sleep in more in the morning as I spend no time on brows.  Thank you Victoria!!< /text>< Date>

<Time>1518383597381</Time><Rate>5< /Rate><text>I took my mother here after seeing many of Victoria's pictures that were posted on Instagram. She had recently expressed interest in doing her eyebrows, and I didn't want her just going to anyone. After doing some research, I decided on Victoria. My mother had always drawn in her own eyebrows, and they never quite looked natural to me.

To start off, her boutique is very cute! (Like her). She had it set up with nice soothing music, and was immaculately clean.

She is very professional; I listened to her spend a lot of time listening to my mother and her concerns, what shapes she wanted to try to create, etc. She also alleviated a lot of my mother's fears when it came to the pain of the procedure - not to say it didn't hurt her, but Victoria went out of her way to LISTEN - which is an art by itself.

Speaking of art, I couldn't help but be very impressed with the efficiency and technique she was doing the micro blading. She really shaped my mother's eyebrows to make her look so naturally pretty! It's been a couple days and so far my mother seems absolutely happy and satisfied.

Thank you Victoria for a job well done!<//text>< pics>

I am very grateful I found Victoria!!! I travel from Redding, CA to see her, because I will only trust Victoria with my eye brows.  Her work speaks for itself. Not only is her work and attention to detail is worth traveling from out of town or even out of state for, but she is a woman of high integrity.  Today, I went in for my semi annual touch up. She will make sure I am completely satisfied with the result of my brows before I go. She spent time looking at my face at different angles and gave me a mirror to critique everything, because she stands behind her work.

I highly recommend Victoria because of her obvious talent, but also because of her excellent integrity.  She's kind and considerate and puts her clients' satisfaction as her priority.  I am definitely going to continue to be a life long client as well as an advocate to help promote her business 😊 Thank you for going above and beyond, Victoria!</text>

I was hesitant to get microblading but I saw Victoria’s Instagram and loved her work. I decided to go ahead and get it done and it was the best decision I have made! My wake up to perfect eyebrows every morning. I looked at a lot of sites determining who I would like to have them done by and just loved Victoria’s work. And after meeting her and getting them done she is a perfectionist and very professional, she chose the perfect color that matched my hair and skin and I’m so happy I found her. Her place is also very nice and clean and comfortable. Five stars for this girl from a perfectionist! 💁🏼‍♀️</Text>

Extremely happy with my eyebrows! I got my eyebrows done by Victoria last week. Of course! before I went to her I did a lot of research. Her price is very cheap compare how she provide her service. Her studio is super clean, she shows each client when she opens a new needle. She drew the shape for me to see it first and also show me some colors before she actual worked on my eyebrows. Victoria is   very nice and pretty. I would recommend anyone who is looking for permanent make up this is the place to go. She does Microblading, ombre eyebrows, lip tattoo and also eyeliner.< /text>

Victoria is meticulous, professional and a true brow artist. I first had my brows done by Victoria 2 years ago, have had 2 touch-ups since and couldn’t be happier with the results! At first I was nervous, but Victoria put me at ease and walked me through the entire process and even in the days following my procedure when I had questions. Her studio is immaculate and clean, which as a Registered Nurse, I am a stickler for cleanliness! Victoria has a true eye for perfecting brow symmetry as it correlates with your overall face shape, asymmetry (as we all slightly do have naturally) and your desired goals. If you are on the fence about microblading, go see Victoria and your fears will melt away and you will be obsessed with your new brows!!</Review>

< Review>
I have  been wanting to get micro blading for over a year now and I was just a little nervous. I went online and searched under yelp and also Google review. I found Victoria and she got back with me right away to make an appointment. Today I had my eyebrows microbladed.  I absolutely love them.  My appointment was on time and Victoria was so professional And gave me exactly what I was looking for. I would highly recommend Victoria to anyone Looking to have beautiful, natural looking eyebrows.</Review>

Was very skeptical to try permanent make-up. My brows came out beautifully, and I have now had two touch ups. I can't imagine life without my brows now. It is such a time saver that I don't have to draw them in anymore. I would recommend Victoria to anyone considering having their brows done.<//Review>

Victoria does such an AMAZING JOB!! My sister recommended her to me, her eyebrows came out great and so did mine! I don't even wear make up anymore because my eyebrows look soo good :).

I came in there with my eyebrows already drawn, so she was able to keep the shape that I really like for myself. Victoria was really patient and went through the colors with me. I enjoyed the whole process! I recommend her to EVERYONE!</Review>

I regret not doing it sooner, Victoria is sweet & made me feel very comfortable. She asked me if had any eyebrow shapes that I had in mind, I told her I'm a guy so I just wanted to have the natural masculine look. She drew the shape to show me first to see if I liked it. She followed my natural eyebrow hair color & filled them in fuller & also recreated the shape to look a lot better now! She is an artist! Would highly recommend Victoria for anyone looking to get there eyebrows Microbladed, this is definitely the place to go</review>< pictures>

I had a really great experience getting microbladding done by Victoria.
I came prior to my procedure to get a consultation & was highly impressed with Victoria & booked my appt. right away.

She was very friendly & professional.
Her place was very clean & peaceful
Which helped me relax as I had anxiety & was feeling nervous.
I couldn’t have had a better experience.
I highly recommend her! I was so amazed how quick & painless the procedure was! I know it was because of Victoria's experience & expertise. I
am so amazed on how much it looks like real hair. I had been wanting to get it done for years & so happy I chose to do it with Victoria.< /Review>

<Text>Got my eyebrows microbladed for the first time with Victoria. I was sooooo nervous and very weary about getting this done because I really wanted to keep my eyebrows looking as natural as possible while still looking very polished and clean. Victoria guided me on the shape and spent ample time with me to make me feel comfortable. We constantly adjusted the shape until I felt completely at ease. She numbed the area and the procedure was virtually painless. I’m so happy with the results and I will definitely keep coming back to Victoria!<//Text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>This has been a long overdue review; was just waiting for my eyebrows to “heal” before giving an honest/complete review.  A little quick background, i had previously gotten my eyebrows microbladed at another location once before and I paid a decent amount of money and wasn’t completely satisfied with the end results.  Other than the inside corners of my eyebrows, i literally have no eyebrows and the previous place I had gone to didn’t do a good job of giving me the look of “full eyebrows”.  I had spots of microbladed eyebrows missing here and there and even after 3 sessions the technician was not able to get it right.  After two years my microbladed eyebrows were pretty much faded and I was desperately looking for another place where I felt comfortable, even if it meant paying a decent amount again.

Luckily I was able to find Victoria and this time around I decided to go with the microshading procedure hoping to achieve the fuller looking eyebrows I wanted in the first place.  Thankfully I was not disappointed and even though I still need to go back for my touch up, my eyebrows are already looking better then before.  Yeah the price was not cheap but this time around I truly feel like it was worth it.  Her place is very clean and soothing and she did a great job addressing my initial concerns and making me feel comfortable.

If you’re considering mocroblading your eyebrows then Victoria is the person to go to; I highly recommend her services!<//Text><user_id>107305716323541907898<//user_id><gmapID>0x80dd26f40deb93ab:0x1986ae459cf3bb0c</gmapID><pictures>None<//pictures><time>1566845298536<//time></record>

Victoria has been a Godsend! I've given so much thought as to a big decision like microblading.  I'm so glad I did my research and came upon Victoria. She truly takes pride in her work, and it is nothing short of perfect!  She's been maintaining my brows for the past couple of years and gets loads of compliments on it. I've referred friends to her all of them singing her praises afterwards. So thank you, Victoria, 5 stars plus for you.  I will continue to be a loyal customer!< /Text>

Went to see Victoria today for microblading and shading, I have to say it was a very clean, pleasant atmosphere, very professional.  I was a little concerned that my eyebrows are a bit too dark for my dye blonde hair, but she indicated that they would lighten up as time goes on and it will be more perfected when I go back for a touchup in 4 weeks.  Overall, I was very pleased, I was very comfortable, it was not too painful, and she opens the clean instruments right in front of you.  Now let the healing process begin.<//text>

I am a mother of 3 young boys and I find it very hard to do my make up like I usually do and go about my day and routine taking the boys to school then work after. So I decided to look into semi permanent make up. I heard of Victoria from a friend of mines and I decided to get my eyebrows microbladed and a winged. Ever since my life has so much easier and the mornings all I do is apply on foundation and I’m ready!</text>

I was a little apprehensive because I did not want anything shocking or unnatural. Victoria is absolutely amazing & reassurred me “it would be natural & not overdone”.  My eyebrows are “perfect”!!

<review>Came in to see Victoria yesterday for microblading. Loved her professionalism & kindness. She took time and effort creating very nice shape for my eyebrowns and then she started the procedure quick and very precise. I ended up leaving her studio with good looking eyebrowns YAYY!!!  Bye bye to pencils, say hi to new badass eyebrowns ✌️.

Thanks again, Victoria!<//review>< Pictures>

I had my brows microbladed last week and I love them. Victoria is an expert and a true artist. I was nervous committing
to something semi-permanent and all I can say is I should have gone sooner.

My appointment was at 10:30 AM and the first 30 mins was just the consult.  She evaluates the face and bones in order
to ensure the correct shape and placement.  I'm in love with how she accentuated my brow bones with the brow shape
and gave me an instant eye lift.

I appreciated the drawing period where she drew in the ideal brow and then negotiated length according to my comfort
level and how bold I was willing to go.  She also tested the colors next to my hair to ensure I was satisfied with the
shades.  She measured twice then cut once.  Victoria makes you feel so comfortable.  I did not feel a thing during the
appointment.  A little stinging afterwards, but very minor.

I'm very particular about my face. For my profession I work on faces and mouths all day and I am detail oriented to a
fault sometimes and I would go as far as sometimes hard to please. I can genuinely say she went above and beyond my
brow goals!  I have already recommended her to some of my coworkers.</text>

<Text>I previously had my eyebrows tatted by another artist but they were very very thin and faded into a blue ish green color and Victoria definitely transformed them for me!! She a color correction so it was now a light brown color then she reshaped them to make it thicker and made it darker since my hair color is black. She was very patient throughout the whole process and made sure I was satisfied. I will come back next year for a touch up forsure(:

Edit: Since google only let's you put one review.

I previously wrote a review for Victoria for myself, but forgot to mention how my moms session went. She's a lot older now and she was mostly worried about the pain but Victoria assured her that it wouldn't be too bad just felt like a scratching feeling. My mom is satisfied it healed and peeled fine and I was with her throughout the process and I felt like so was very attentive and caring.< /Text><user>107999668100819592771< /user>< Resp>

I've always had very sparse eyebrows with little definition. I'd been curious about microblading but didn't know anyone who'd had the procedure done. Based on the Yelp reviews and ratings, I decided to try with Victoria. The procedure itself was far less painful than I had envisioned, maybe the first cuts hurt a bit, but as soon as the numbing cream went on it was bearable, and I might mention I have a rather low pain tolerance. I will say despite being told that the procedure wasn't truly finished until I'd had the touch up session, I did panic initially, and thought I was quite unhappy with how it had turned out. In time, possibly after a month, they finally took their current shape and I'm very happy with how they look even pre - touch up. So, essentially, totally worth it! Makes getting ready way easier, but do be patient if they dont look exactly as you hoped in the first few weeks, once they heal they'll be perfect!< /Text>

< Review>
I decided to train and learn all the tricks and trade of microblading and powder ombre eyebrows with Victoria. I could have went with the renowned microbladers from DTLA or in the Valley, but I decided to go with Victoria, and I do not regret my decision. In fact, I recommend anyone who is interested in learning this art and skill to choose her.
First and foremost, this is a one on one learning/teaching moment. I couldn't find that anywhere and you won't either. She gives you her undivided attention from day one until you earn your certificate. I really enjoyed her teaching style, as she is just honest, extremely patient, consistent, very thorough, and just simply real. She provides constructive criticism so positively that you can't help but learn from your mistakes and really appreciate that learning experience. I can go on and on, but one of the best reasons for training with Victoria is she will be your biggest cheerleader and wants so much for you to succeed. Her lifetime support is sooooo invaluable, as I am constantly calling her for either a morale boost, some refresher questions, or to just simply check in. She is super responsive, and is just simply awesome.< /Review>

<text>My well loved 23 year old mustang broke down half way between Eureka and Santa Rosa. On the advice of the AAA driver, I took it to Wayne & Sons. I’m sure they weren’t super excited about a random person leaving their car with them and going home (4 hours north), but they got me in and they were amazing and made a stressful situation much easier. Great communication, I definitely was not overcharged, and they even called my shop at home to find out about the car’s service history. I just got home and she drives like a dream! Thank you! I highly recommend this awesome shop of kind, honest, professional, Mustang lovers!<//text>< user>

<review>I would never recommend these guys to anyone. I've never left a bad review for any business but in this case I have no choice. Long story short they had my truck for 3 weeks for repairs that should have taken half a week at most. Constant miscommunication and excuse giving. That's probably the worst part is everything was an excuse. They even used the excuse the phone wouldn't stop ringing as to why it took so long. After all was said and done I spent $2300 to get my vehicle back in worse condition then it went in with. I brought it in for steering work, timing adjustment and transmission fluid and filter change. $2300 later I can't drive over 45 without the truck pulling all over the place. They charged me for timing the carburetor. It still would stall for the first 5 min in the morning. I asked why and they said they couldn't time it because a screw was missing. Ok, why did you charge me? One day after getting my truck back I go to take it out and it won't shift into gear. No reverse, nothing. They did a transmission service and say they had nothing to do with it. It's been 2 weeks and I can't drive my truck. I have to have it towed somewhere where they know what they're doing. I wouldn't let these guys anywhere near my truck even if they offered to fix it for free. PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DON'T GO TO THESE GUYS!!!</review><username>Jeremy Gladden<//username><date>1617197833371< /date><UserId.>104911974798687975763< /UserId.><gmap_id>0x808438f688bdf4cb:0x617585dbac297d04<//gmap_id>< Rating>

< Review>
So my  1991 jeep that i had driven for 15 years and put over 120k miles on had started running rough and it finally stalled and would not start.  I had it towed to Wayne and sons to be diagnosed.   This vehicle gave an ignition code of 24 (crankshaft position sensor) and it was in a crank no spark condition.  They told me after a day or so that the computer was bad on the vehicle and that a new computer would cost $1000.00 plus installation, plus the 250 bucks they had already spent on the diagnosis.  I asked if I could get a computer somewhere else  ( due to the high cost) and have them install it.  (At the time i did not know the install was 4 screws about 5 minutes of labor)  they said I could get a computer and they would install it.  I bought a brand new one from Orilleys and delivered it to them.  They spent half the day and then told me the new computer from Orilleys was defective and that they see bad parts from them all the time.  But they had to spend more time to diagnose my vehicle after they got the new defective computer so the total was now over 500 bucks plus the 250 I spent on the computer at Orilleys.  Luckily for me Orilleys took the part back and refunded me my money.    I had replaced the following parts on the vehicle before I brought it to Wayne and sons.  Crankshaft position sensor, maps sensor, and coil.  I had my vehicle towed back to my home.  I put in a new starter and the situation was the same.  I had the old computer in the vehicle rebuilt and the situation and code were the same code 24 and still a crank no spark.  I decided to sell the vehicle for 500 bucks and a guy came with his test light and figured out there was spark above the coil.  I had seen on YouTube that the older jeeps will not restart unless you unplug the crankshaft position sensor for 5 minutes and then plug it back in.  We put the old coil into the vehicle and after leaving the crankshaft sensor unplugged for 5 minutes the vehicle started up and in 20 minutes was running perfectly.  I suspect Wayne and sons did not know to unplug the crank sensor for five minutes and there is even the possibility that they neglected to test for spark above the coil.  In either case the code was the same 24 when i dropped the vehicle of to them as it was when i picked it up and after I installed the rebuilt computer.  I now suspect the new computer I bought was fine from Orilleys, but because Wayne and sons could not figure it out they needed to have an answer.   For 15 years this car gave me great service and the guy from craigslist who fixed it in 30 minutes and bought it for 500 bucks now has a good running dependable 4x4 no thanks to Wayne and sons.   They deserve a negative rating but I will have to settle for 1 star.< /Review>

Took my Mercedes GLA 250 4Matic
The other day to get a  B1 service.
Took them few hours same day adealership.
Did a good job and saves some $.

If I where to go with the dealership it would be a few weeks and much much more expensive and not even sure why I always seem to have problems after going to the delaerahip.

Saved us over $4000.  So my sister in law took her 15-year old Subaru into a local specialist when her car consistently bucked when starting from a stop.  They told her she needed: head gasket replacement, new brakes, new brake lines, new tires and radiator for a total bill of $6000.  She is retired so this was a shock.

She called me for advice; I told her to go to Wayne & Sons for a second opinion.  He fixed the car for $1800 and it runs fine. No head gasket replacement. No new brakes. No new brake lines. No new tires. Tune-up Yes. New radiator, Yes. A couple of other things.

In a few months, he told her there a some other items that will need attention for a total of about $1300.

Wayne comes through again.<//Text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>I decided to make a grand journey from CT to FL to CA. The car did just fine. I spent a couple days in Santa Rosa and was in need of an oil change, transmission flush, etc. I brought my car to Wayne and Sons and the work they did was commendable. They are timely, honest, outgoing, and committed to helping their customers. I strongly recommend them.<//Text>< user_id>

<review>Excellent service. Very thorough honest and fair. Absolutely would recommend and will be returning here if I need repairs done in the future. These guys will take care of all your needs. Everyone there is very friendly and accommodating. The first time I met Wayne he gave me a ride home all the way across town and far out of his way when I was about to ride my bike. Another time arranged a ride for me when I was in a tough spot. You will not regret taking your car to this shop. Thank you so much Wayne and Son’s for fixing my jeep!!< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1579041573029, 'text': 'Thank you for your business and recommendation.'}<//Response>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Wayne and Son's is fantastic. We were fortunate enough to find Wayne from doing some online research, and I can confirm that the 5 star reviews are accurate.

We were stranded in Santa Rosa with nowhere to turn and took a chance getting towed to Wayne & Son's. I explained that we broke down, needed to get back to Arizona ASAP, and he dove right in to the diagnostics of the problem.

He made room for us in his schedule and got us back on the road the same day. Wayne was so thorough he even was able to tackle a few other repairs on this visit. I would recommend Wayne to anyone with or without an RV. If he were in Arizona I would take all my vehicles to Wayne.

Thanks for keeping us safe and on the road.<//Review>

Found Wayne and Sons after the dealer could not get my Jeep Grand Cherokee in for over a week, but here they were able to get it in and fix the issue the same day I called! Recently, my car has been having a mystery problem that no one seems to be able to diagnose and/or fix, but Wayne is sticking with it and I am confident that he will get it solved. So happy that we found this shop and now have an honest and dependable place to take our vehicles.<//review>

<text>Amazing customer service!! I took my wife's 2016 lexus 200t in for warranty work because they were one of the approved shops on the list I had. The rental car company dropped the ball so the owners wife personally drove my wife to work in Rincoln valley and picked her back up because they got the job done in the same day!! All of this at NO CHARGE to us!! I am a auto tech myself and checked there work and they did a GREAT job!! Only reason I didn't do it myself because it was under warranty. VERY impressed and would highly recommend this shop!!<//text><Name>Kevin Watson</Name>< rating>

<Review>I was at a nearby auto body shop to work as a vendor when my radiator started leaking. Didn't know anyone close but the bodyshop called Wayne just behind and they got me in and looked far and wide for a reasonably priced radiator for my Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. They got it done the day the part came in and at a good price!</Review></record></dataset><record>

Best! Most reliable, honest repair shop I have found in 42 years of living in Sonoma County. Have been quite familiar with this industry in the past. Honest, trustworthy, genuinely appreciative people. They are EXPERTS at diagnosing an 'issue' rather than throwing sometimes expensive parts at a problem HOPING it will solve a problem! I am not a number here, I am treated courteously, respectfully and professionally. They present 'options' when possible. Can't say enough good things. It is so rare to find a place like this where I can truly TRUST and know that my business is not only welcomed, but appreciated by these Hardworking, Honest people!<//text>

Top notch service. Their attention to detail and customer service is stellar. They walked me through everything, rather than just threw a bunch of terms that I would not understand at me. I had taken my Volvo to the dealership and they did substandard job. Not these guys, they put the car up on the lift and showed me how things function and how mine was in need of work. They also don't charge you for inspection if you get the work done with them, which is awesome, as the dealer charges you either way. They are a family team, and I will take my Volvo nowhere else from now on.</review>

<text>After a long road trip my 14yr old car was getting noisier than the usual old car rattles - BUT still getting 31+ miles/gallon so it was worth fixing: Wayne took it on - within a day, he not only quieted the newer noises, he quieted every ping, knock, rattle and bang - it's like driving a new car!  WAY TO GO Wayne!  I love my car even more than I have in the last several years.  THANK YOU and I TOTALLY RECOMMEND this shop!  Miriam< /text>< pics>

You are not my normal mechanic, she was on vacation.  I called your office and explained my  oil leak problem to Brett, he told me he was booked for the day, but to come by and he would take a quick look.  He accessed the problem, estimated the cost and made an appointment for the next day.  My car was fixed and runs really well.  You provide wonderful service and I would highly recommend your shop.< /Review>

This garden center has great variety of fruit trees and roses. Also good selection of plants and shrubs for the home garden. Staff are very knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. There is a small section with fertilizers and soil amendments. Parking is plenty at the lot or around the store on the street.< /review>

I love this spot, the workers are so friendly and helpful! They have all kinds of plants from succulents to flowers to fruits and veges to house plants and trees! I always talk to them and they told me they have been around for 50 years, that says a lot! Much love here and totally recommend! =)</Text>

I absolutley loved it, staff was really helpful in helping me find the perfect "sun-loving" plant for my dad' resting place. They were excellent with patience as I explained that I knew nothing about planting but wanted to take an interest in leaving to garden.  I will definitely be back.< /text>

I like this place. It's small enough to get personal service and large enough to have almost everything I want. I needed advice on a little project that I'm not ready for, and they had good ideas for me. #shoplocal</text>

Wendell is great! Went there with questions about growing vegetables and he answered all of them. He also helped me choose a fertilizer. Super nice and helpful. This is why I love smaller shops and not huge stores.</Review>

My first time buying in a nursery garden. They are very friendly and have a lot of options. But I think that there are other bigger nurseries. I bought my passion fruit little tree there for 12.99. I think it was a good price.<//text>

Brandon stockman, owner of covina garden center is the nicest owner I've ever had the pleasure in talking with, his knowledge of plants and horticulture is very extensive, always trust an owner that carries clippers on his belt not a chip on his shoulder, I will definitely go back to buy plants there again< /Text>

I went there to buy heirloom tomatoes and both times I got something else other than heirloom. I got a bunch of cherry tomatoes and they wern't even heirloom and I didn't want cherry tomatoes. I bought red and yellow bell peppers and they all came out green. Very disappointed!😧<//review>

My wife and I have been their frequent visitors in last 15 years.  Too bad that Dr. Sun does not offer miles like AA and United!

All I can say is:   Their work is A1+;  Dr. Sun, his fellow doctors and staff, friendly; and their environment pleasant.

Simply say, there are so many dental offices around, if our experience was not good, and our each and every visit was not well worth it, we would not have been going back to their office for so many years.

That says it all!< /Text>

I've been afraid to go to the dentist and had procrastinated a visit for several years. I was recommended this place and I'm so glad I made the call. Everyone were very friendly, respectful and professional. No blame or shame whatsoever for my irrational fear of dentists! I had a routine check, fixed two cavities and was also helped to fix a couple discolorations. The results were amazing! Dr Trent was able to see what materials had been used in my teeth before in Europe and could explain how some material and policies were different there before. I felt very convinced and reassured about her competence.
Yvette in the reception was very helpful in guiding me through the insurance process.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1606239638156, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind words.

Before actually visiting for my appointment, Dr Sun had accommodated my tight schedules to fit me in, which is much appreciated.

Office is tidy and clean, staff are friendly and professional. I did my oral exam, X-ray, and cleaning at Cosmetic Dentistry & Implants,  staff are quite detail oriented, quite thorough trying to fully capture details of my teeth, luckily I did not have cavity. Dr Sun examined and offered some suggestion for potential orthodontic treatment. Very lovely and pleasant experience here!

I would not hesitate to recommend Dr Sun! :)< /review>

Very reputable dental practice.  My dentist is Dr Tran and she is very meticulous, gentle and super friendly, too.  Yvette who manages scheduling and insurance is as nice as they come!  I’d highly recommend this practice.<//Text>

PS. I just hope the Dr. Sun's office would hire better assistants and have better training before assist or cordinate with head Dr. Otherwise  everything would be prefect. =)<//Text>< pics>

Had tooth cap or crown. It was sensitive one time should have let more time pass b 4 such a drastic procedure now sensitive when bite down on food .A good tooth was wasted no pain when chewing. Regret Sun could at least put on gloves and use explorer to check for crack because he could not see on x Ray just authorize procedure is too extreme</text>

I'm not sure why this dentistry doesn't have more reviewes. This place is AMAZING the DRs are extremely knowledgeable, patient and gentle. The office is advanced with all the latest equipment  and very clean. Everyone that works here is super nice and very caring.

Dr. Sun is really knowledgable and experienced,  he always comes up with a perfect treatment plan for you; Dr. Kang is very gentle handed  and  patient, she explaines all my treatment to me;  the two manager, Yvette and Cindy, is warm-hearted, they try their best to find you  best payment plan. Pilar, the assistance, is a very professional, she takes care of me every time from the very beginning to the end of the treatment. All the staffs at this office treat you like a family member.

For the first 2 minutes the two guys that work there together are talking with no regards that I was going to spend money in their store. Then seemed upset when I asked for help finally. People like this should not be in a store where they deal with the public it’s what’s wrong with the world today. I help pay your bills as well as everyone else that walks in there.<//review><Name>Michael Ensign</Name><Pics>None< /Pics><Rating>1</Rating></record></dataset><record>

The guy that seems to work here constantly is awesome. He's very courteous and will help you out as long as you're behaving yourself plus the price is for random things like t-shirts and knives can't be beat anywhere else.<//review>

We occasionally shop Walgreens even though their prices are extraordinarily high. I bought Colgate Peroxyl at WINCO 16.8 ounces for $9.22, Walgreens was $7.79 for 8.4 ounces. It wasn’t like that years ago when I was a Walgreens manager - no wonder the store wasn’t busy. There was very little inventory. No sign of management and I only saw two employees. It was about 6 pm on a Thursday evening.

Melo’s serves great pizza and Italian meals. We’ve patronized them since moving to California in October 1973. I knew Melo for many years as we insured his sister and brother-in-law for 20+ years.<//Review><user>108781800947660872109< /user></record></dataset><record>

Went to the Bank of Stockton. It's new to me as I just moved here 2 months ago and had to open a new checking account. This is my 2nd visit after opening accounts with my family and the teller remembered me and my son. This for me is great service. I didn't even speak to her the first time we came. She just remembered we all opened new accounts.<//Text>

Shop the South Shore Plaza for a climate controlled experience less than 20 minutes south of Boston's center. This multi-level mall has it all: excellent places to eat and drink, department stores and smaller more specialized shops as well as common retailers you don't want to miss. You'll be sure to find what you're looking for within these walls be it fashion, food, or home goods. Here are retailers and stores that make South Shore Plaza unique to the area: Target, Nordstrom, Apple, Dave & Buster's provides hours of entertainment for guests.< /Review>

Parking here is a joke. The layout of the parking lot is not very intuitive. This winco location is always dirty and some of the surrounding buildings have been abandoned or inhabited by failing businesses. One after the other the businesses start up and then disappear very quickly here.</text>

Very poor experience. After visiting, an un-wanted notification on my phone asked what my experience was like. That is just creepy.</Text>

Pretty neat place. Bought a couple firearms here. Phil was my favorite employee there. Aside from the million pages of paperwork we had to do...I was very happy with my purchases. He no longer works here tho darn it. But the stuff here is pretty neat.< /text>

So glad we ended up stopping in on a whim tonight! Literally every employee was super friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Not once did anyone have that "gun store" attitude that you'll find at other Sacramento outdoor/gun stores. This place has great stock, is well-organized and very clean. Phil, the assistant manager, was so pleasant to deal with and felt like chatting with an old friend. Rico was also great and professional during our transaction. Not only are the prices here better than any store in the area, but the customer service makes you glad to give your business. Left here with a handshake and a smile, as I wish more companies would do! Happy to have made a big purchase here, look forward to making many more, of all sizes, for many years to come!</text>

< Review>
Great team here. Wife and I went in to find  a firearm she can handle, and ended up with some great coaching that helped her better handle what we already have. Even if what you want isn't currently available, the crew will work with you to make payments towards it, so when it is available it will be yours. This is so much better than hearing "we don't have it and don't know when it will be available, good luck."<//Review>

<text>Turner's is a chain of stores focused primarily on small arms. They have lots of inventory across their entire store network and will happily let you purchase something from another store and transfer it.

They carry some firearm accessories and other miscellaneous outdoor gear for hunting, but not much for fishing.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< name>

<Review>The staff here is amazing simply put. They make it feel like a mom and pop shop but with a large company standing behind them. Yes you may pay a little more then somewhere else but the level of service and knowledge you get well outweighs a couple dolors. I will not buy a firearm from anywhere else. Give them a shot you won’t regret it.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Turners has some of the most down-to-earth staff members and a conservative, chill vibe. Professional and friendly with a large assortment of hunting and camping and fishing gear for such a compact location. Don't overlook this location for great options on firearms as well.</Text>

<Review>I arrived for a PPT (private party transaction) of an off roster rare handgun and was impressed by the knowledgeable and helpful staff.  Since I was two hours away, a customer focused member of the staff called me when my DROS (Dealer Record of Sale) cleared, so that I could use my time efficiently.  I picked up my new handgun today and bought the last of the 9mm Luger ammo and some M-Pro 7 cleaner.  Highly recommended.  Also, surprisingly, no wait during the pandemic.  Some FFLs are reluctant to perform PPTs during the pandemic, but Turners was happy to accommodate me.< /Review>< Pics>

There’s been a delay with DOJ and they called me to save a trip and gas. Will be going here from now on. Fair prices but will be back solely for there customer service. Roseville store!<//Text>

Went in on 10-18-2019 to get an Item on sale. I called ahead to confirm that it was in stock first and when I got there it was. When I came in I was pleasantly greeted by a man named Phil. Phil was professional, knowledgeable, and pleasant the entire process. I was in and out in less than 20 mins.

Thanks Phil and the Turner’s team!</review>

Smaller but nice place to get your hunting and fishing gear. A good selection of firearms and staff are very helpful especially Kelsey who helped me with a firearm purchase and informed me of upcoming sales.</text>

Came here after going to Ammo Depot.  The people at Ammo Depot had a bad attitude and weren't super helpful.

Kelsey, the manager, was super friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.  This customer service earned the store a pistol sale and new customer.<//text>

< Review>
I have to say i saw this place with good ratings and they did not disappoint but place to take your vehicle. They were fast and on point 👌 with information of the repairs. Saved my 2020 road trip. Thank you so much guys! Highly recommended to all my friends!<//Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I would recommend anyone who needs car repairs to visit Corral's M & B Repair. The problem with my vehicle was diagnosed quickly, estimates were accurate and reasonable, repairs completed within a day, and a very friendly staff.  My overall experience was pleasant and will definitely be returning with any vehicle repair issues.  I will also be letting my friends and family know about Corral's M & B Repair as well.  Thank you John!<//Text><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

If i can give them 10 stars i will. Friendly and honest with amazing prices. This is how a business should be. I came here for an oil change after reading all the positive reviews. They were having an oil change special so the price was super good. I went to the dealer and they wanted to change my rear brakes but before i bought this car i did an inspection and everything was fine and it was confirmed by Corral's Mercedes and BMW repair.  The brakes were replaced not long ago so the dealer was wrong and just wanted to charge me. Never again. Anyways. I highly recommend this place and will not take my baby anywhere else. Thanks!</review>

Very honest auto repair shop. I am a loyal customer. My last visit was for brake repair. They replaced the brakes with new ones just as promised. Most of all I assure that they provide auto parts which are cheaper than if you buy them by yourself. Excellent service. I recommend them!</text>

<text>I use their services from 3 years and i can tell that there are just awesome auto repair shop especially for BMW and Mercedes ! Great guys that work there fixed my 335i always. Nice clean shop and they don't rip people off like the stealership!

Last time i brought my 11 335i in for intake valve cleaning, oil housing gasket, trans fluid, and rear diff fluid. They did great work, brought out back to see my valves when the car was torn apart and when I checked out the total cost was $200 under their initial quote.

I found my BMW maintenance/repair shop and i will keep to use it!
Highly recommended !</text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Do NOT take your car to Corral’s, unless you want to pay for work that your vehicle doesn’t need. Or pay for work that won’t ever actually get done in your car.

I have a 528i and my son has a 545i BMW. We have taken our vehicles in to corral’s Several times. We have have spent over $8,000, in fixing ( supposedly)our vehicles. Only to the cars needing more work according to Corral.

Long story short, the last time we took the car in they gave me a quote of $3,700. When I went in to ask for a print out of what my car needed, he said he would drop the price to $2,000. NOW WHY WOULD THEY WORK FOR FREE??? I took my car in to BMW dealer and my car DID NOT need any work .

My opinion they are not honest.</review>

Half ass work
Take my Supra in to get the ac looked at and it took them 3 days to figure it out. Not calling or giving updates throughout, I constantly had to call for updates. They end up doing some wiring to bypass my AC controller. There was wire hanging out everywhere, so much extra wire they just shoves it in the fuse box panel under the dash. Go to start my car and it's dead. Come to find out their awesome wiring job is just sticking one lead of the wire into the fuse slot for my cigarette lighter and clock. Now my clock stays on causing the parasitic drain. Don't worry I'll be calling in about 10 mins for you to fix this.<//Text>

<Review>Totally find this place to be dishonest! I brought my vehicle in due to a problem I was having with my 535i. They quoted me a  ridiculous amount and claimed that my head gasket was leaking and needed to be replaced. They quoted me $4600! I laughed and declined any further service, replaying that for that price I might as well take the car to the BMW dealer which I was trying t aviod due to high maintenance prices. They then did a thorough inspection and found nothing of the sort. My coolant system had not been burped and bled properly and was causing air pockets in the coolant system.BMW only charged $186. Way to take take advantage of a woman’s         “presumed” ignorance of cars.

<text>This shop has very regrettable customer service. I was told that the baterry i had purchased from them had a warranty plan but yet they refuse to even look at it to fulfill the warranty. I requested further information and was constantly stalled by employees at the shop saying thay John was the only one that could do anything. After a week and a half of follow up calls on my part John finally spoke to me only to give me his sarcastic tone of voice and making it clear he was not going to take a look at my situation because "that's not how things work here". In few words he told me to get lost and hung up on me. They'll overcharge at every opportunity they get, very very regrettable experience.</text>< pics>

We asked the employee if we could instead be charged for a diagnostic check rather than being charged for a steering rack reprogram which they replied saying there is nothing we could do about it.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>Sadly, I didn't want to write this review, but felt I had to due to the service that I received. Initially, I brought my 2006 BMW M3 to Corral's to have two issues diagnosed; VANOS and DTS system. I was told the car would be taken care of no problem, and they would let me know. I called at 5pm, after the car sat the entire day, and was told it hadn't been looked at yet. So, I picked up the car and brought it back the next day. It took me three days to hear back about the problems and was quoted almost $9,000 by my technician there, John. I had them leave out replacing the VANOS (for which I did myself), and had them replace the DTS computer, clutch and fix some oil leaks, in the area of 5,000$. Keep in mind, I was told that both the rear main seal and oil pan gasket were leaking oil, but the car had never dropped a drop of oil in my garage before; I opted to have them just replace them for good measure. Three weeks later, I received a call that my car was finished and ready for pickup. I picked up the car and brought it home, thinking my issues were solved… they weren't. Upon driving the car home, I noticed that one of my gauges wasn't working and that there was a loud drive-line noise to be heard between 2300-2700rpm. After a very concerning drive back home, I opened up the hood to give it a quick look. I discovered that the sensor for the gauge was unplugged, and nowhere to be found. I also found brake fluid all over the compartment and the brake master cylinder to be overfilled and over-flowing brake fluid. It also looks as though when they bled my brakes, they didn't use any tubes to redirect the fluid, and just opened the valves and let the fluid spurt all over the calipers and suspension arms. I also have a very costly set of StopTech 6-pot big brake kit, so when they just let the fluid drain all over it, it ruined the powder coat on all four pistons, which cost over 1000$ per corner. There was also oil and finger prints all over my engine bay, like no one really cared for my car. Upon pulling my car out of the garage, I noticed oil on the ground....and multiple drops, only after sitting for a couple hours. After bringing the car back, I got the gauge sensor and asked about the noise; John told me it was the tires and nothing that they did, in a very un-caring fashion, like I was bothering him even asking. I then brought up the oil leaking and he told me to bring it by and that he'd look at it. At this point, I had lost ALL trust in the business, and didn't even trust them to clean up their work in fear of them creating more problems with the vehicle. I brought the car to BMW of Riverside to have them fix Corral’s mess, and was told that there was driveline damage done to the vehicle from Corral’s pulling the transmission that created the noise while driving, and the oil leaks were coming from oil lines that were moved in an improper fashion by Corral’s, which caused them to crack and leak. Sadly, the damage cause by Corral’s cost in the thousands, for which I can only assume they would deny, shrug off, and tell me it probably wasn’t their fault. It’s not even worth my time to try and call them.

I’m a military member, and thought Corral’s would be easy because it’s across the street from March ARB. After this experience, I’m urging everyone I know on base with a BMW or Mercedes to steer well clear of this place.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Took my 5 series to be diagnosed , they were not able to diagnose it, but still charged me a fee, just to say they don't know what the problem is.... and be careful and look over your vehicle before signing, as there was damages to my vehicle when I received it..< /text>

The food was great but the customer service needs to improve we arrived at 9:00pm and left by 11:00pm  it was almost 2hr. Wait for us to receive our food and by the time we got our food the order was all wrong we got two different dishes that we didn't order it took an extra 15 minutes to get our food right didn't ask if we wanted any refills or if we needed anything else like condiments or dessert I don't think I'll be dinning there anytime soon it's not worth the wait.<//text>

Had a great breakfast with family.  Robert took excellent care of us.  I had the Grand Slamwich with fresh avocado and tots.  The sammich was great but the tots...holy moly the were excellent.

First cup of coffee tasted old, and Robert had us fresh cups out almost as quickly as we mentioned it.

**Update.  Returned on 7.19.  Had awesome service from Ana and the Tres Leches pancakes.  Holy MOLY it was delicious.  Seriously, the best item I have had there.**< /text>

<text>Placed several curbside orders and also eaten here more than a handful of times. Each time, received good service. Before COVID shut the outside tent down, the tent got crowded. But the staff worked hard to clean the tables and get the orders out. The pricing is decent.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

I was so busy talking and not paying attention that I think she used that opportunity lol should've paid $52.</Review>< Pics>

Not enough personnel at the front to take care of a long line of customers and they always take longer getting food ready.
And even by the time I get the food it’s warm, not hot.</review>

< Review>
Placed an online order last night, arrived there 20 minutes later, walled in to pick it up, only to get "sorry, your order was not supposed to go through, we are closed. They are working on the kitchen".... The order did go through, I got anconfirmation, and an emailed receipt. Of course "working in the kitchen" did not stop them from charging me for the order. (The charge is still pending on my credit card).

Tried to place an online order tonight, BUT their website is down. So I called, the lady who answered said "yes, we are taking orders but only online".
"But Your website is down"...
I got the "at this time, we are not accepting phone orders... at this time".

Did I hear something about restaurant owners complaining that business is slow, and whining about the lockdown???.. Well, here is one restaurant that is turning customers away!</Review>

<text>Horrible service! It wasn't even busy when I came in. (Which was around 7pm on a Saturday.) Plus, the waiter didn't even bother to ask if I need a refill on  my drink or more ranch for my fries.  But instead he brought my check and placed it on the table.
Other than that the burger was delicious!</text>< Pictures>

Went in with a large group of students. Greeter was courteous, professional and most importantly patient. Servers made sure each order was correct and kept our drinks full. They don't have sweet tea, but the raspberry seems to be a California staple. Would definitely recommend, especially if they get some sweet tea.</Text>

I'm giving this place a one star the  food was great and loved it. But the service needs a lot to be worked with we were the only people in the restaurant and still had to wait for service. It seems talking to each other is more important then serving the customer. I don't think I will be returning to this place again<//Text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Review>This is the Denny's that we use the most and they are usually pretty good. My husband's order was perfect mine not so. They were very busy.  I ordered the country fried beef steak from the senior menu. It was supposed to come with a salad, brown gravy on the steak and I also ordered mashed potatoes and gravy.
Well salad was forgotten, I had to ask for it and would rather have had it served before the main course. The steak had yucky white gravy and I'm pretty sure the menu said brown which would have been perferable. Also no mashed potatoes instead I got seasoned red potatoes. Only reason I didn't complain was they were actually pretty good!
No complaints about our waitress Sally. She was excellent. Kept coming back to make sure coffees and water were refilled and make sure we didn't need anything.</Review>< pictures>

Denny's is a good place to eat when nothing else is open since they are the only ones open 24/7 even holidays. Had a good thanksgiving dinner here.< /text>

Last time I was at about 1am on a Saturday night a believe. It was pretty busy. Me and my friends just finished watching a movie at the theater and decided to get some dessert. Was seated immediately. All we got was shakes and some apple pecan ice cream thing, all was tasty. They brought out all of our shakes at different times so it felt awkward sipping on my shake while my friends waited for theirs, not that big of a deal I guess. However they brought my friend the wrong shake and he had to wait until they made the correct one. One of the waitors brought our desserts to the wrong table at first and we're just hoping the customers who received it didn't start digging in. Not the best experience but not the worst, been here a few times. They make a great pot roast sandwich.< /text>

Denny's.  Traveling across America with my mom and dad when I was young I can still see the huge sign above the highway, all lit up, DENNY'S!  Like an old friend welcoming you in for a meal and a chat. Their menu is great, although I must admit I love the skillet dishes; the bourbon sauce is excellent!
You don't see the high Denny's signs so much anymore, but their restaurants are still across the country, in every state, just about every town, city, Burrough and township.  Americana to the max!< /review>

<review>I give this place 1 star, I went last night with my husband and daughter and the server has no customer service skills. She came to take our order and I barely told her what my daughter wanted and she was already asking "is that it" and she tried walking away. I looked at her very serious at this point and told her to wait as I still needed to order and so did my husband. She also took forever to come and tell us that she was going to be our server and that she almost had forgotten about us. She also had gotten my order wrong.< /review><time>1567268870058</time></record></dataset><record>

Have visited this Dennys several times for many years before we moved out of Palmdale. I would have to say this one was my favorite one to go to. The waiters there were always so friendly and our food was brought to us sizzling hot. Just the way we enjoyed it. The waiters always would be consistent in checking in on use while eating and seeing we didn't need any refills or anything else with our meals. Also if we are in the area there is no question to which Denny's we will be eating at.< /review>

We love coming on the weekends to get the Cheddar broccoli soup and Turkey sandwich. Armando is one of the best waiters we've ever had. It's always a joy to have him as our server. He always remembers us, which makes it feel even more inviting. We always enjoy our food and the service is always great!</Review>

Very cold as the air conditioning was in overdrive.  Other diners coming in when we were there commented how chilly it was too. Friendly quick service.  Average Dennys good, his choices & value, not exactly healthy.. we're used to more taste & better nutrition in the UK.  It seems unless you pay absolute top dollar in California you can't get taste & nutrition...😕<//Text>

<user_id>105162584592528481908</user_id><Review>Denny's is one of those places that I never really think about, but always end up going to. Their food is great but I know place's that can make all most all of their items better. Where Denny's always manages to get me is the fact that they are open when no one else is. How many other restaurants can you enjoy a good steak and eggs at 2 in the morning? I can't recall how many countless late nights have been spent here after a very long day, when me and a couple of friends can get together over some coffee and eggs to watch the sun rise. You just don't get that experience anywhere else.< /Review>< pictures>

The servers are super-friendly. Their senior menu is affordable and there is a good selection. The only flaws are that there is too much yelling between the servers and the kitchen staff.

Denny's is one of those locations that you can always complain about it but at the end of the day, it always has your back. The food is cheap and the service is fairly quick, plus its a great hangout place at night time. I would highly encourage anyone to come here and one of my favorite things about this place is the fact they have chargers near every booth.</review>

I don’t know what it is, but every time I call a Denny’s to place an order their phone is either perpetually busy, or it rings forever.  This place is no different. Called many times over an hour, and their phone is constantly busy.  Nobody will answer the phone. Seems to go orders aren’t important over there.

For crying out loud, PICK UP YOUR PHONE!!!

<Name>joe lach</Name><Text>Denny's is always a good choice for the family. We have one person who needs to eat gluten free and some of Denny's  menu items are marked GF to indicate this. The location of this Denny's is good. An out building of the AV Mall it is easy to get to.  I prefer this Denny's to the Lancaster one, only because of an incident with a waitress at the other Denny's. If you can't get along with me in a restaurant, it's you.

The owner or manager with the blue shirt and little badge walking around behind the waitresses was absolutely rediculous. He kept asking every customer how their service was. Every time he came over to us I felt the tension. It almost felt like even I worked there the tension was so bad. If the waitresses were not perfect it was obvious there would be a problem. If it wasn't for him making everyone uncomfortable I would of given the place 5+ stars. Leave the poor girls alone and let them just be themselves and do there job!<//text>

The best place for breakfast lunch and dinner.  The service is wonderful and  Mary Lou was so helpful and always asking me what else do I need and feels my cup with a warm and great coffee. Sam was very nice and the store was extra clean and all smiles and very friendly environment . I will recommend this place to all my friends and family and we will go back . This was my second time . The first time was not the same as today . The place was so busy but they were giving everyone a very good service. Thank you very much.<//review>

< Review>
Gross! Ok it's been awhile since I have been to Denny's I admit. BUT fries had no flavor, no wonder they push their seasoned fries. Almost $12 for a Cali burrito asked for blue cheese instead of ranch in the burrito didn't get it.  Barely any chicken or cheese, mushy avocado, full of pico and stale tortilla.
One waitress who also worked the register, had cash to pay the bill so her 19% tip was the change. Just wanted out of there.  Won't be going back.</Review>

Waitress was awesome. We were a group of 4 young women with the majority kf of us under 18. She treated us better than most do, and service was fast, and food was good. The only improvement would be if shakes could be made with soy milk.<//text>

It was a windy night at around 3:30 am the smell of cheese sticks and Ranch Dressing. Potatoes and chicken tenders with bbq stopped the hunger me my wife were having..  The waiters and waitresses were awesome and the food straight up colonary.</Text>

<review>We like this Denny's.  The food is good, The prices are great.  And the service is always excellent. I guess the decor is OK as well.  I feel better there than in some other Denny's I've visited.
We particularly like taking our mother-in-law there.  She is confined to a wheel chair and it is so easy to wheel her in and right up to a table.
Bottom line - I've never been disappointed with this Denny's.<//review>< resp>

Three stars as consolation. Due to: Mediocre service- waitress with 'tude demanding my order...screwed it up anyways. I got the wrong item. Still left her a tip.  Food- mediocre. Steak and eggs were good though. Cooked medium and tasty. Pancake soggy and bland. Been here done that, No 3rd chances....once or twice was kind 3 to 4 is blind.<//Review>

The food at the particular Denny's is so good and tasty. The wait is usually not that bad, even at peak times. The staff is polite, professional and make us feel welcome. "Super Manager Sam," takes the time to visit tables to make sure guests/cutomers  are enjoying the meal and having a positive experience. He genuine and clearly cares. The restuarant and rest rooms are always clean. For us, there is no need to go any place but Denny's for an amazing breakfast!< /text>

Loved this place, the menu for all you can eat was long and had a lot of choices. It was a few dollars cheaper than Big Tuna. We did have to wait about an hour for a bar seat for two people.<//Text>< resp>

<text>This Denny's Location was awesome!  From th3 moment we walked through the door, until we left we were treated like visiting royalty! The hostess greeted us warmly & took extra care to find us the perfect seating. Once seated, we were asked by Not 1 but 2 Servers, if we were ready to order. Our waitress Kayla took  our order, made sure it was correct, served us our drinks & reassured us that our order would be ready shortly, again, she asked "Is there anything else I can get you before your meal is ready"? NO, okay then, I'll be right back with  your meals!  And, so she Did!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< user_name>

<review>Dennys is not my favorite place, and havent patronized in years, but tonight i had dinner with my family, and was pleasantly surprised. Had a delicious cheeseburger, fresh tasting beef. fresh ingredients as well as a tasty burger buns. The service from our server was excellent and very pleasant. Glad i visited tonight.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Service was great. Even for a Friday night. There is a dedicated security guard on site to keep everyone safe. We never had anything to make you feel unsafe, but at least he's there just in case. Good thing to know if you decide to take the family here on Friday night.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c25998ac8100ab:0xc1269aab22678876</Gmap_id></record>

I go to a lot of Dennys restaurants, mostly because I love diners. Many of the ones I've been too have very slow service at night, not here however. The service was exemplary; the food came out within minutes and with no issues what so ever.<//Review>

Staff is kinda hit or miss, but the food is usually bomb! and There open very late! Best place if you don't want jack in the box at 2 am in the Morning. The place is kept pretty clean all the time. Only bad side is claw machines suck!!!! haha not a big deal at all !<//Review>

<response>None</response><Review>Denny's at AV mail is great.Denny's have the same food everywhere but what makes the difference is there service. Sam the General Manager spends the money it takes to give people great service.AV Mall Denny's is second to none.It has to  be the best around when it comes to service.That includes all of Palmdale - Lancaster and maybe the Valley - Hollywood and LA. I haven't find a better Denny's elsewhere and I have been going to restaurants all my Life. Hats off to Sam a great General manager< /Review><rate>4</rate><UserId.>105875858284670718860<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The water was fresh out of an unfiltered sink. Hashbrowns and bacon were hard as a rock. My eggs were so undercooked they were still chirping. There was hair in my girlfriends omelet. The cheese wasn't melted. And I finally had a whole plate of butter with 2 pieces pancake. But Anthony up front was nice.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

The service staff is always helpful and courteous to every diners' needs. The food is delicious and warm, spot on. I recommend the breakfast bar area for the best use of the wi-fi. Try and get a table with "the one in charge" Benjamin or try and get seated where Salvador serves. Always a pleasant time. Enjoy the great food, wonderful service and surprisingly excellent food!<//review>

<review>I drive for Uber so I stopped at Denny's in Palmdale for coffee and pancakes at 3 in the morning. I was surprised to find a busy, bustling place with both after-hours and early-morning diners. The wait staff were very attentive and my pancakes were perfect!< /review>< username>

the Palmdale Denny's is much better then Lancaster Denny's the food is fresher then the Lancaster and they'll most helpful and much more neat and cleaner than Lancaster Denny's. and the one in Palmdale has a much more friendly atmosphere than the one in Lancaster.

My husband and I usually go there because of the of the fast and friendly service provided... the waitress and waittors even knows what we like to order... but lately on 3 occasions we have sat there waiting to make an order, it took almost 30min after servicing us water and hot tea to ask us what we wanted to order. The first time it happened we let it go... it was getting busier..but come on lets make them wait 2 more times...? No longer acceptable to be forgotteln like that. We were pass by 2 times with them saying ill be with you. ... I just felt that because we were a regular there that it was okay to make us wait longer...lost my interest in this place ... sorry...<//Text>

Consistent food quality and service, a typical Denny's.  We were passing through very late at night, nice to have them open 24 hours.</text>

The waitress was patient and offered ideas that would make our dining experience great. Sadly I have not received this kind of service at the other Dennys.This is definitely the better of the two Dennys in Palmdale.<//Text>

This is a late night stable.  Getting out of class, work or partying late its ideal for comfort food.  The service is normally very good.<//Review>

What can I say about Dennys.... sometimes the food isnt too great.... sometimes the food does not anywhere look like the one on the picture.... and depending on who cooks....
BUT.... Friendly Staff.... Nice Ambience... And Their Waitress always finds a way to check in on you the right time... and is always courteous especially at night... and the fact thag its open 24hrs.... makes it soo much nicer...<//review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Worst food & service I have ever had!!! Ordered the meatloaf, and got a Stouffer's meatloaf instead of what the picture showed!!! The new menu sucks!!! It is no longer elder friendly, with most of the senior items no longer available!!! The soups that were once offered don't even exist anymore. The chicken noodle soup is only offered Friday thru Sunday, and the clam chowder is no longer available on Fridays. The Head Honchos have blown it Big Time like they did a few years ago!!! While I was sitting there, an  employee carried in boxes of Idaho potato flakes, possibly purchased at a local market! This Denny's is located at the Antelope Valley mall, and I will never eat there again! As for the service, from the time I ordered, until my meal was delivered to my table, it took more than 40 minutes. The server said it was because they had so many tickets, but the place was not that crowded!!! I say it was because they were heating up the Stouffer's TV dinner, but they swear they don't  use Stouffer's. I know Stouffer's products and you can't say this wasn't. After leaving, I became extremely ill. Shame on Denny's and the money grubbing High Mucky  Mucks that have once again put money before the customers!!! I will never eat at this Denny's again, and if this is the type of garbage they're going to serve at other Denny's, they will lose my business! Good going, College Clods!!!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Make sure the girls early in the morning if you're going for breakfast. Otherwise you could be waiting for a few minutes before you get a table or Booth. The employees are friendly courteous prompt they always come around frequently.<//text>

Tons of rude people work at this Denny’s and I have heard them talk bad about customers. DON’T GO TO THIS ONE. The service is so slow and food isn’t always good. Not worth it.< /review>

Horrible service. I personally work as a server and the service I got here was terrible. Manager asked all the tables how they were doing except ours. We’ve been waiting for our food for 40 minutes and still nothing. Server has asked if we are ok ONCE.</Text>

Service is a hit and miss like any other place, depends on your server. Food is also ok. Being married to a prior Dennys server nothing is better than her service or prior stores food qualtiy. The cooks make all the difference too.< /text>
