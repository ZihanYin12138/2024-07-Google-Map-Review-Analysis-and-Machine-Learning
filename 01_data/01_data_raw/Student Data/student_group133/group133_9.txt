<Rate>1< /Rate><review>Kevin R Cruz is the absolute worst driving instructor ever!!!! I signed my daughter up for one of his lessons he demanded all the money for the 6 hours up front, He came an hour late to my daughters lesson, he made me daughter feel very uneasy and he even shouted at her, and he kept looking at my daughters chest on, he never returned any of my calls or text after that do not trust these false reviews on this weirdo/scammer he forcefully makes people leave a good review look up "FREE DRIVE TIME" the real reviews are there.< /review></record></dataset><record>

I had a great experience with Kevin. He was very helpful and knew exactly what he was talking about. I’m a very nervous person and he was very helpful when it came to calming me down. His knowledge made me feel very safe and I feel I becam a much better driver because of his help. I would definitely recommend him to others< /Review>

<review>I had a phobia of driving but this driving course taught me how to confront my fears. Kevin is a great teacher and was very patient with me. I was referred by a family friend and the price was very affordable. I passed the driving test the first time with only missing 2 points. I was able to use his car for the driving test and even though I am a small person, I felt very comfortable driving his car. If you want a professional, patient, and informative course, I suggest the CDL expert.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80dcda16d5cfe801:0x944194fe7080b0dc<//gmapID></record>

This is by far the best driving school that I’ve heard of... Kevin is extremely trustworthy and well known in corona he is always on time with appointments and your final drive test is a for sure pass...... Kevin could also give you a lesson right before your final test just for good measurements< /Text>

This was the best choice for our family ! I called ten different places and this was the only one that would let me book an appointment for the same day. The prices were fair. They offered pick up and drop off service. I signed up both of my daughters. After their first driving lessons my daughters gained more confidence to drive. Even I feel safe to get in the car with them now. Thank you Kevin !<//text>

<text>Kevin helped me drive a lot better. I thought it'd be harder since I'm not with my dad, but it wasn't. He's even teaching me and my brother! how cool is that?! The price was also very cheap, 160 for 6 hours for each person being taught. that alone put less stress on my mom, so I definitely recommend him. 100%

Two of my boys have had their second lesson with Kevin Cruz, and they both stated how much he has taught them. He is even providing additional lessons to one of my sons that is on the autism spectrum. I sent him a text message asking if he had time and was willing to go out with my son a few more times. He immediately responded and booked a lesson for the following day. He has a good understanding of special needs individuals and stays calm while he's teaching. Mr. Cruz did need to reschedule one appointment and apologized, but it was no problem with us. Life is busy and we understand this. We have a few more lessons to go. I believe Kevin has given my boys exceptional tips on what to do and what to expect when they are out on the road. His job is to teach our kids, and that is what he is doing. Good show Kevin and thank you!</Text>

I'm doing this after my first lesson and he is a really good instructor who can give a lot of information and make sure you are prepared for your test. He did get Starbucks and I didn't so that was the only disappointing part. I would definitely recommend him if you want to take your driver's test. He will definitely help you out.<//review>

I called to ask more information about this school and they asked way too many questions when I just wanted to know certain prices. After ending the call they sent me a direct message saying “NOT FOR YOU! Enjoy paying more $ elsewhere with your attitude!!!. You are now blocked you had your chance” I’m 15 and I thought this was terrible and incredibly disrespectful. Worst customer services.< /Text>

I'm not sure what the hell kind of business this is. I called, a guy answers says hang up.  He calls back. Can't answer it. Call him back right away, first words out of his mouth, why are you calling me!  What ever business this is, definitely not someome I would do business with.
I just listened to my voicemail and this crazy person left me voice mails yelling at me do not call me selling me things.  How about as a business, you talk to people calling you and seeing if it might be a customer.  If he is this disrespectful not knowing who is calling to hire him, imagine how crazy he will be in class or something goes wrong in class.  Avoid this guy, major anger issues.</text>

I made a call and was able to go out and test drive the very next day. Kevin, my instructor, was very friendly and patience as well as very knowledgeable. He genuinely knows what's he doing and I feel very comfortable knowing he's the one guiding me on the road.

The instructor Was extremely unprofessional to my daughter accusing her of doing drugs because she didn’t hear an instruction he gave to her as she was driving. Then when we reached out unknowingly he didn’t work weekends he was very rude in his response to us. To me it’s worth more for  quality over quantity. But that’s just my opinion. You judge for yourself. As we all are different.<//review>

<text>Kevin is the worst instructor u could possibly have. During my lessons he would have me wait in the car as he gets his coffee and pick up stuff. On the first lesson he made me give him a 5 star review. I knew the second he did that something was off. He continuously yelled at me and called me stupid. I had an argument with him as I was driving because he kept yelling at me for nothing. Save ur money and find a better instructor. He is crazy and trust the reviews that rate him 1 star. If I could, I’d give him less than a star. He was a terrible instructor and I found someone new who made me feel comfortable while driving and I am so much better than I was before!</text>< rate>

I highly recommend this driving school 'drive time fullerton' with Kevin who is best in this business. As an international student form India I got to know about him through my friend, and he is never wrong. All my classes so far is too good. He is helping me a lot as I am in my emergency to get a license soon.I would recommend my friend from India to join this with making sure you give him enough time to complete your schedule as he is too busy with completely packed stuffs all day. So to learn best wait for it.

This driving school has it own apps to help people like me who is far away and too lazy to go to an actual driving school. The app on smart phone has everything you need to know to prepare for a written test (plus, you can get an actual certificate to take to the dmv if your 18 or under). the program also give you a call to give you helpful information about what you need to know before taking the written test. I appreciate the work they done and I hope others will feels the same.</Text>

Disclaimer: when driving with Kevin, already know how to do everything and already be confident driving. He will leave you feeling low and hopeless, and constantly talking about what a great teacher he is. I understand that I made mistakes as I was learning, but every mistake (even minor) was met with yelling and anger. It was not a productive learning environment. He expected me to already know things and were not patient with my learning pace. Kevin was very rigid and made low stakes, fixable mistakes unnecessarily stressful. He was insulting, and I was drained and in a bad mood after every session with him. On our second trip, he was particularly rude, condescending, and overreactive. I had to schedule an appointment with a different school to get proper teaching, and they took me on the freeway and to the costa mesa dmv (the experience with them was much better, and made me feel confident about my driving). Overall, my experience with Kevin sucked and I wouldn't recommend him to anyone.< /Review>

I was calling to get information and he was completely disrespectful and run he ended up having up on me. RUDE!

Taking my driving lessons with Kevin Cruz was the one thing that helped how nervous I was when first driving. Not only does Kevin give a helping hand with teaching you all the best tips on how to drive, but he talks with you about important things to know.

Do not use Kevin Cruz. He is completely unprofessional. He made an appt  on Thurs for Sat. and then after I paid for the 3 lessons, he said he had an emergency and had to cancel. He said twice he'd call me to reschedule, never called. Then, he said he could do the following Sunday at 10am, a week and a half away. I said Sunday didn't work. So, he said Sunday at 8am. I said Sunday doesn't work. I said if you can't do it this week, then go ahead and give me a refund and I'll go elsewhere. That's when he actually called me back and started berating me. He was so rude, so I said, there is no way I would trust him in a car with my daughter. He still will not pay me back, so I'll have to take him to small claims court. It seems from looking on here, he gets a lot of money by having people pay first and then not actually following through with the driving lessons. I wish I would have read the reviews before I paid him. The reviews on his site are all fake.  Stay away from Kevin if at all possible!</Text>

I met Kevin, he gave me my first driving lesson, asking me to pay 200 dollars in cash, He did not accepted card. Those were for 4 hour class. 1 class before my written test and 1 class after my written test.  I took my first lesson and in the middle of the lesson he told me to wait, he went to his house and made me wait for 10 to 15 min. Later I called today to schedule my second class and he started yelling at me with bad words telling me he was busy and didn't even letting me talk back. Then he just blocked me on the phone, not even wanted to schedule or giving my money back. Very Rude and with very bad words.
Then he just keep calling me back, telling me to learn English and that I was supposed to know that he is calling and more bad words. Whats wrong with this guy.<//text>

Kevin is very disrespectful and unprofessional. The first lesson he was 30 minutes late, he yelled at me, and he forced me to give him a 5 star review half way through the first season. I called to schedule my second appointment to get my money’s worth anyways and I couldn’t hear him that well and Missunderstood what he was saying. He called back to saying talking to me as if I was a child and dumb and cursed at me. He is a scam artist I wish I read the reviews before using this idiot. Although the price is cheap don’t use him!!!! Go to a real driving school.</text>

Kevin was able to help teach me the very next day after we made the call. He is very efficient and effective in his method of gewching, and I was able to pick up a lot in just two hours. He puts a lot of effort in interacting with his students and I really confident in his ability to prepare me for the drivers test.

Unethical, immoral, unprofessional and is extorting kids. Kevin Cruz has also changed his business URL and business name to avoid you seeing his other reviews. He is working the system to trick the public and victimize families. Kevin Cruz forces students to give him a 5 star rating in order for him to sign and approve their student driving requirements. He misses appointments and will yell and scream at the student and parent when contacted or questioning about how to reschedule an appointment. He even refused to complete my sons services and refused to refund us after missing his second confirmed appointment to drive with my son. The first and only time he did take my son out to drive he actually had my son park on the street while he left for 30 minutes to eat dinner. Kevin Cruz  cursed at us for asking to reschedule for a third time, then refused to even talk to us or take our phone call. The customer is always wrong in his eyes. We have contacted the better business bureau ( of which indicated to us that he has several business names that change often) We contacted the DMV to report his extortion to get 5 star ratings to minors.  You can report at the DMV customer care division . We contacted our bank to get a refund and will file a small claims suit if necessary. We will be contacting our police station tomorrow. We are also going to locate the school district he works for and file a grievance with them as well. Somehow he is getting google to not show or count bad reviews-- I hope google doesn't remove this as Kevin Cruz is praying on children and extorting money and refusing to accept any responsibility. He is working the system and changing his company names to avoid honest ratings with google and better business bureau ; thus avoid detection. If you use him you are jeopardizing your child's well being and will see his true colors first hand. Mr. Cruz is also using google technicalities to have my review removed.. For example I originally had DMV and BBB contact numbers so he flagged and had it removed because google says that's a violation.. So I will keep editing until it complies with all google policy so that the public is safe from his transgressions and deceitful activities.<//review>

DO NOT USE!  Kevin R Cruz is a scammer!  This guy requests that all lessons be paid for in advance in cash and then makes it impossible to schedule the last two lessons.  After my daughters first lesson he said that we should call a couple of weeks before her exam and do the last two then so that everything is fresh.  I tried to get the next two lessons scheduled and it took three days just to get in touch with Kevin.  When I finally talked to him he said the earliest he could do would be January 4 which was 3.5 weeks away.  He requested that I text him the day and date of our appointment that he just scheduled so he would have it.  I did just as he asked and also asked that if he had a cancellation to let me know so that we could get done sooner.  He said no to letting me know about the cancellation and also denied scheduling the next lesson.  After I questioned the length of time for scheduling he called me and yelled at me and said that I had an oddball personality and that I was weird.  He then hung up on me before calling back and doing the same all over again. He blocked my number so that I could not call or text him and he continued to call me and say that I love drama and what was my problem etc......  He then cancelled the Jan 4 appointment because I was questioning his practices.  He is impossible to talk to, very unprofessional, and is a bully.  He makes his first time clients give him a 5 star review while they are on their lesson.  If you look at his reviews they almost all 5 star or 1 star because of his tactics.  He is taking advantage of his position and having people write these reviews under duress.  Kevin R Cruz is not to be trusted with your children or your money.  Every complaint that he answers the customers are oddballs, have weird personalities or are just lying.  All of the complaints are almost identical and his response to them is the same.  Please do your research and do not trust this guy. Do not use Kevin R Cruz or his 20 plus years of experience.  He is just a ripoff artist.<//text>

This was done on his phone. He is inappropriate and very unprofessional.  He showed up an hour late after I reminded him we had a driving lesson today, then proceeded to have my daughter first go to a drive thru car wash, then after that stop so he could get a coffee, then he pulled over in front of a Mexican restaurant and made her log on to her google account on his cell phone so he could push her to write a 5 star review.  Unfortunately for him his behavior and wrong doing will not go by unnoticed.

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>I would appreciate if you would stop referencing the obviously coerced review when speaking with my parents. It is quite obvious that you are unable to keep a level head when communicating with people that are not   going to bend to your exact will and deal with your borderline narcissistic behavior. Moving forward to the actual review, you for one stopped for coffee and to get your credit card, taking time out of my instruction time. Even further you on numerous times took calls while I was driving, you knowing this was my first time. This would not be as  big of a deal if you were to have received the call, however you actively sought out and called individuals to speak to during my instruction time. This not only put your life in danger, but also mine considering this was my first time behind the wheel. Again, you need to seriously self reflect in order to find something out of your life because currently you just take kids from their homes and force them to write reviews all the while you spew rhetoric about how you should be payed more. On that same note: you get payed exactly what anyone in their right mind would ever pay you seeing as you are not even what I would call mentally stable.</Review>< pics>

This guy is a total scam.  He's got several websites for this drivers school.  BEWARE.  We paid 170 thru chase quick pay to a Kevin Cruz.  My son was on lesson 8 of the 10 and all of a sudden his website has changed and there is no longer the link for him to finish his course.  Tried calling the guy with absolutely no response but when I was first paying for it boy did he respond asap.  Now my son has to start over but that's ok.  I wouldn't trust my child in a car with this obviously much needed anger management person.  Check it out, he's got several sites so he can filter out the bad reviews.  My cool driving school, Drivers Ed Driving School, Orange County Drivers School and they all have different addresses.  That's ok, I better business bureaued all his "existing businesses".  Better refund me my money Kevin,  Or the reviews will keep coming in.   Oh and did I mention, he's absolutely rude.  I could not believe the way he talked to me when I called to schedule my son's driving time.  Can't imagine how he probably talks to your kids.  DO NO USE THIS GUY, HE WILL RIP YOU OFF<//review>

<text>It is funny how bullies become victims!!

Kevin for your information, I have lived in this country for 38 years.  I have a bachelors degree from Cal State Fullerton and I have been married to a white American for the past 20 years.  I don't think the barrier was my English.

I called This establishment, there was no answer so I left a message, few minutes later, Kevin called me back.  I answered by saying that my son needs the six hours Driver's Ed to get his permit.  Kevin started asking me if my son drives and I answered no.  So he asked if my son needs driving lessons and I said  that is why I am calling, he needs his required six hours of driving.  All of the sudden he started yelling at me asking why is my son driving illegaly?!  I said no he is not driving, so he yelled again " Do you even know what you are doing?"  I was confused about what was happening, I called just to get my son a Driver's Ed and I am being yelled at for no reason so, I hung up.  But he was not done, he calls my number again and yells into my phone saying that I have an accent so I am from another country therefore I have no idea what I am doing.  Now that is narrow minded if not something else!

Now, I did not leave a comment before just to be nice but apparently, Kevin also took that as another indicator that I am a scared foreigner that does not speak English.  well, what do you think of my English now Kevin?!< /text></record>

This driving school is very unprofessional. Kevin is not on top of his things. I am 15 and half years old and even I can understand that he is a fraud. I had my first driving and thirty minutes in, he made me write a 5 star review. How on earth am I supposed to judge a person that quickly! In the beginning, he started scolding by saying how stressed he was when he picked me up. He said this because there was construction going that didn't affect the roads direction at all. I asked him for my second appointment and he keeps saying to call in 2-3 weeks. He needs to schedule an appointment, not tell me to call later! I wasted my 200 hundred dollars on this guy. I told him to give me a receipt and he still hasn't given it or sent a picture of it to me. I want to finish this before summer break ends. He said that I'm lucky to get a lesson this quick but other schools do it in 3 consecutive days. Very bad school and person. Doesn't even respond to our messages and calls. Doesn't even give refund. Vvvvveeeeerrrrryyyyyy bbbaaaaadddddd. Never take lesson from this school or person.

Response to his response: he started off by saying mean things intended to clarify himself. There are better ways to clarify yourself to the other person. Then keveeeeeeeen says he is the owner and something big and everyone should listen to him. My dad then gets mad because he is being rude and selfish. Number one rule of business broken: never talk rude to a customer. Listen to them first before running your horses. Then he calls again as if to get roasted by my dad again. BIGGEST RULE OF BUSINESS: give confirmation of purchase. We paid cash and he is not GIVING US CONFIRMATION. I asked for a RECIEPT A BUNCH OF TIMES but to no avail. Send a picture of a receipt at least. MOST DRIVING SCHOOLS finish course in 3 consecutive days. He wants to stretch it. When customer wants to finish then FINISH. All we need is that certificate and the rest of the training we can do by ourselves. That makes it easier for you. You don't even have to follow your process. I now that I will pass that driving test my first time because I am the type of person to work as hard. I have done enough training that someone has done in 2 weeks. We are perfectionists. Your a+ you gave me for my first tims driving was a 2 out of 10 for my dad second time driving. We spent HOURS not Minutes training because we want this done soon due to my stressful academic school life. That will give me no time to do an appointment and find it cancelled(as I have found out from other reviews). When I was in car driving , he got a call from someone else and said she was lucky to get a lesson so soon. When I ask, he says he is booked which I know is not true since he likes to bump people until later times as I read from other reviews. Another rule of business broken: being on top of things. You need to call and make appointment with us. Not you saying call later. Ok at least set an appointment if we call. 2 weeks right. Set appointment after two weeks. I don't want to wait 2 weeks to find out that I have to wait another week. Last rule: give refund or partial refund!!!!!!!! If we have problems give our money back proportionate to our lessons. * he stopped to put his money in the bank also without telling me where he went. But that is just the least of problems.  HARDEST TRUTH ABOUT BUSINESS: ONCE YOU LOSE TRUST, IT IS HARD TO GAIN IT BACK. SO GIVE REFUND. AND BE RESPECTFUL. GIVE RESPECT, GET RESPECT!!!!!!!!!< /review>

<pictures>None<//pictures><review>*EDIT* BUYERS BEWARE. This 5 star review was made while parked in the middle of my driving lesson as demanded by Kevin. I was pressured to take out my phone and leave a 5-star review right in front of him  and he even told me what type of things to say in the review. I was in a vulnerable state, I was in the middle of a parking lot with this man who was supposed to be teaching me to drive, it was my first time driving and I had already paid for 2 lessons and felt if I refused to leave the review it would lead to angering Kevin and other unfavorable implications.
I only had 1 driving lesson with Kevin, which he was over 15mins late to and was still cut short as I drove him to his next client’s appointment. I was told to now get in the back seat and the new guy drove me to my home. (this was also his 1st time driving and he made several dangerous maneuvers that even Kevin admitted "scared him.") After my lesson, my mom has called and texted several times in attempt to either arrange my second appointment or get a partial refund. He responded to make it very clear he does not give back refunds for any reason. Kevin has avoided calls or dismissed my mother’s text messages. When he does respond, he is rude and demands that she doesn’t text him without restating in EACH text the information of the student being discussed even though he hardly responds when we such does; forcing her to then send a follow up message about whether he received her text to begin with.
When initially booking his service, he was kind. His attitude changed the day of my appointment when had to text him to make sure he was arriving today since he was late. He bragged about himself, his experience, his website, and his car throughout the lesson. He complained to me about the parents who get angry at him and start drama “for no reason.” He even bragged about how he constantly bump his clients’ appointments that already had a lesson to get in a new client in.
I will admit that I learned useful information about driving and the dmv test. I was able to adapt to his teaching style to get the most out my lesson. However, many others may find his methods too aggressive. He instructed me drive in the shopping center parking lot did he tell me to park so that he can go buy coffee (and make phone calls) he the gave me very useful information to remember and practice for my driving test. Then he told me to get my phone out my phone and asked if I had a gmail. When I answered yes he told me what to search for so that his school came up and told me to leave a 5 star review and what to say in that review. He then waited ‘til the review showed up so that he could like the review before instructing me to leave the parking lot. I then drove him to his next appointment.
I implore you to search for him and look for the true reviews he tries so hard to keep hidden not the  5 star reviews he forces them to write.

I'm learning to drive right now for with Kevin. I was totally nervous to start out driving but 15mins in  I felt relaxed. Thank you Kevin, Totally cheap price for great experience.

Kevin Cruz this was my first time driving and he was very helpful, I learned a lot & is very patience with you. The price was also a very good deal. I high recommend him as a driving instructor, he is also a high school bus driver so he knows what he's doing.

I've been getting tires from D'Adamo from my first car forward.  They have high quality service and the best price in town on Michelin tires.  Did you know they also do breaks, struts and front end alignment and fix flats, like they just did for me.
Go see Mike and tell him some fisherman sent you in.<//review>

Happened to get a flat while just down the block, so I hobbled in, and they were so nice and actually replaced the tire really quickly. Highly recommend.<//text>

Update: One year (or so) later and I have now had time to monitor my tire wear due to alignment. Wear is spot on. Equal across all 4 tires and all 3 points per tire (outer, center, inner). Will come here from now on to get my Tesla Model 3 alignment done.<//text>< pics>

Small friendly shop where you'll always be well taken care of. Prices are not cheap but are well worth the price has the service you get that comes with it cannot compare with even the big shops.</Text>

I had a brake failure issue. They replaced calipers and brake lines which was reasonable. But they also replaced pads which I'd just replaced 3k miles ago. Also charged labor for pad replacement which is trivial when calipers are replaced. But it inflated bill by close to$200. Brakes worked but not happy with ethics at shop.< /review>

<Text>Very professional service. Their customers r a nge from well known race car drivers , custome car builders to the average consumer. But one thing cus tomers all share is the expertise and attention to safety detail. You receive as a benefit of purchasing your tires here at D'Adamo tire the tire experts. a locally owned longtime family business you can trust. Oh and when your quoted a price for tires that is what it costs out the door tax incl fees etc all inclusive. Good Deal Guys !!!<//Text>< Pictures>

I was hoping to support a small Napa business, but when I called this place to get a quote the guy who answered was incredibly rude and condescending. Decided to go to Les Schwab instead and they were super friendly, they even fixed my tire for free.</text>

The new car wash is bad. It’s like Quick Quack but with way more up selling. Like dude, shut up...I just want a quick car wash. The new car wash is on a rail that drags your car through the wash. This is not good for sports cars with low profile tires. Expect heavy wheel damage if you choose to come here. Once is enough for me to never come back. I liked it better when there wasn’t some guy trying to sell me this and that.<//text>

One of the lowest prices for fuel in the area. The car wash has been upgraded. You go through the wash and vehicle gets dried very quickly. This is a big improvement over the old wash. Friendly cashiers. Plenty of drink and snack options too.<//Text>

It's clean, inside and out. Would love to see directional arrows to pull into the pumps - it can get a little crazy. I love them car wash area after the remodel.< /review>

This is usually where I go for gas in roseville. Or another arco unless there is good competition for prices. I often find arco has good prices for the area<//Review>

I have come to this church all my life. If you come to mass at certain times, you see the same faces and may become "church friends" with them. I would even go as far to call it a community. Padre Nabor is a great father. He truly knows how to speak to the people.

However, I feel like the pandemic has altered the flow and sense of community within this church. First, it is very hard to social distance from people. If you attend mass outside, people still get close to you if you stand away from the tent. If you go to mass inside, the mass gets packed and people will get too close to you. I have lost count of the amount of times that I have had to tell people to please keep their distance. Some people are genuinely kind and respect it. However, there are other parish-goes that become furious or even upset if you tell them. The ushers need to pay more attention to the social distancing guidelines and reinforce them. It's unfair to arrive to church early, find a spot to stand or sit, and have people get close to you, and they don't even bother saying anything. Second, I have noticed that the seats under the tent are very close to one another. Even if mass is outside, guidelines still need to be placed. I truly hope that this parish does not become lazy and careless about COVID-19 protocols, considering that more than half of the church-goers are middle-aged to elderly. Perhaps, I would suggest limiting the amount of people who enter the church during very important days, like Christmas, Lent, etc. During Ash Wednesday, there was tons and ton of people that were not distanced and would even be extremely close when getting in line when receiving communion. Just a suggestion for the well-being of the people who attend this place.</Text>

< Review>
Amazing parishioners and father Nabor seems to be what this parish needs. I have witnessed many years there that my kids went to school and I never saw a priest stand up on a table, a ladder to help set any event up but him. What a team player plus he has done much for our school. We have had two wonderful principals that I have adored. My last child is a recipient of the Presidential award at St. John Bosco. The other two siblings attended St Joseph’s and St John Bosco too. My oldest is in his twenty’s. Great school, great parish.< /Review>

<Review>I love God! What can I say? I am a  BIG fan of God. I love Jesus and Mary too and the way of all Holiness! I love how my church has its doors open most days and times. I love how this place of prayer is usually available besides my room, my car, my anything else. Father Nabor is directly honest with problems and people and life and family. He helps make one think in a better form through a positive attitude. I believe that Father Robert really educates well about the history of Christ and the Holy Spirit and Bible! I loved the way he educated the children and families in church about the story of Our Lady of Guadalupe and Juan Diego. I learned something that I never really understood! Thank you Father Nabor and Father Robert! 🙏❤< /Review><userid>101548198294854367643</userid>< gmap_id>

<username>Eduardo Jr.</username><rate>5</rate><review>(Translated by Google) This church is very beautiful
The first time I came to this church, it was very neglected and neglected, but when Father Nabor arrived, everything changed they put planters, benches, a roof outside the church, the truth is there are no words to show how beautiful the interior of the enclosure is, they changed too many new benches impressive paintings i am very amazed by the change thanks to father nabor who is a very cool friendly father father nabor is the best

<review>(Translated by Google) How can the words of a priest impact children.
Yesterday, Sunday, at the end of the 5:30 mass, my children, my husband and I approached the priest Nabor, so that he would do us the favor of signing some sheets that they gave in catechism to my children and the priest began to ask to my children about what he talked about during the homily or something that they would remember about the reading and they did not know how to say anything at the time and the priest continued to tell my youngest son to help him or to say something to remember, but He said I don't remember anything and I was surprised by the response that the priest gave to my children:
"So what good did it do you to come, you just came to make the lump to warm the bench"

I understand that the children should pay attention at mass and be attentive, but I would have liked to ask them first if they understood the Spanish language well because I attend mass in Spanish because I do not understand English well.
Excuse me father, I'm going to contradict you,
Although my children did not know how to respond yesterday because they did not pay attention, because they did not master the language, because of nerves or because of what it was, I do not think that it was of no use for them to go to church as you told them.
You know my 11-year-old son was so sad, his spirits were on the ground and I tried to explain a little to try to make sure that his words do not form in the wrong concept there were many people around and I think that embarrassed them even more.
Let the children come to you and with love and respect correct them.
In my family we are trying to make them have love and respect for God and yesterday I did not want to say anything because I felt that it was not the moment.
I would like to know if the pope thinks the same as you.

(Original)
Como puede impactar las palabras de un sacerdote en los ninos.
El dia de ayer domingo al finalizar la misa de 5: 30 mis hijos mi esposo y yo nos acercamos a el sacerdote Nabor  ,para que nos hiciera el favor de firmarnos unas hojas que les dieron en catecismo a mis hijos y el sacerdote comenzó a preguntar a mis hijos sobre que habló él durante la homlía o algo que se recordaran ellos sobre la lectura y ellos no supieron decir nada en el momento y el sacerdote continuo diciendole a mi hijo más pequeno que le ayudara o que dijera algo que se recoradara , pero el le dijo no recuerdo nada y me sorprendio la,respuesta que les dio el sacerdote a mis hijos  dijo :
"entonces de que sirvio que vinieras,  solo veniste a hacer el bulto a calentar la banca"

Entiendo que los ninos deben poner atencion en la misa y estar atentos , pero me hubiese gustado que les preguntara primero si comprendian bien el idioma espanol pues yo asisto a misa en espanol porque no comprendo bien el ingles.
Padre disculpeme pues le voy a contradecir,
aunque mis ninos no le supieron responder ayer porque no pusieron atencion , porque no dominen el idioma, por nervios o por lo que haya sido, no pienso que no haya servido de nada que fueran a la iglesia como ud les dijo .
Sabe mi hijo de 11anos se entristecio tanto, sus animos estaban por el suelo y trate de expliarle un poco a tratar de que sus palabras no formen en el un concepto erroneo habia mucha gente alredeor y eso creo que los avergonzo a ellos aun mas .
Deje que los ninos se acerquen  a ud y con amor y respeto corrijales.
En mi familia estamos tratando que ellos le tengan amor y respeto a Dios y ayer no quice decir nada pues senti que no era el momenro .
Quisiera saber si el papa piensa igual que usted.</review>< Pics>

<Review>Great 45-60 minutes uphill workout on mountain bike. Can rest at the meadow after 15 minutes. Take in the view of the Bay. Can see SF on a clear day. Ride another 30 minutes and get another view. Can see Monterey Bay and enjoy the view of the trail you took to get up there. The top is just another 2 minutes.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>El Sereno is an incredible secrete gem in Los Gatos. It is hard to get to (hike or bike up private roads) but it is well worth it. The trail is in good condition but it could be rocky at times (especially near the top). The higher you go, the more spectacular the views get.
The trail can get hard at times but there are plenty of good places to take a break before going on.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Gmap_id>0x808e4a15f2fdee6f:0x9e6abe4f8e5b93cd< /Gmap_id>< response>

<Review>Great place for a hike. The trails are well kept and it's not too busy.

The parts where there are tons of redwoods is so freaking awesome! Tall a** MFrs. Great tranquil place to meditate on nature.

Once you get to the very top, though, there are no redwoods to cover you from the heat. So take a hat of you go mid morning to noon hours. It could get very hot in the summer.

Please be aware that not all trails are for biking.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<review>Would you like to hike a trail that is both close by to South San Jose, and where hardly anyone else is about? Then pick the El Sereno Open Space Preserve. Parking is limited and you will probably have to hike 200 yards up a steep hill to get to the trailhead, but it is totally worth it. There are several trail possibilities, and the steeper and longer the climb the more rewarding the views!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Driving up the Montevina Road is a pretty nice experience, and provides it some nice views of CA-17 and hills around Lexington reservoir. You also see some impressive mansions on the way up.

The preserve is however not open to public, so you hit a dead end on the road near the summit :)< /Review>

Short trail at the end of a steep, windy, remote road. Kind of anticlimactic for the purpose of taking a dog for a walk. He had a couple ticks too. I hope he doesn't have more. The views are beautiful though. Glad I went and saw it but doubt I will go back.</text>

Hard to access with no parking & routes partially exposed to the sun, however hikers & cyclists can enjoy miles of sandy gravel track while views of the Bay & Lexington Reservoir are spectacular.< /Text>

Exposed and without shade, so don't visit in summer during the heat of day. Good in winter. There is really only one trail that is accessible. The other two are up in the hills behind Los Gatos and local residents won't let you park there at the trailhead (there is ONE space at one end of Overlook, zero parking elsewhere), or anywhere nearby, so you have to park at the bottom of the hill and walk all the way up. Hike before your hike. Oh wealthy people. The one accessible trail with parking has about five spaces, and it's quite steep with lots of ups and downs.</review>

<review>Poor Service, Bad Chile Relleno.        Before pouring our drinks, the waitress took another table's order. Their food came up 10 minutes before ours, although our order was sitting in the window when I walked by. The Chile Relleno tastes like a microwave. We we're never checked on during our meal.<//review><UserId.>103816363280673388389</UserId.><Gmap_id>0x54ce45c35729c5f5:0xc5f17e35b948d3d0<//Gmap_id><Response>None<//Response>< Time>

This was my first time dining and I'm very pleased with everything. Our waitress was very friendly and cordial, and the environment was very homey. It almost felt like I was eating in a home instead of a public place. I ordered a quesadilla and it was above my expectations. The prices are ok, about what I'd expect at a Mexican restaurant of this quality.
5/5 for me.<//review>

<Review>Terrible service. Told to sit anywhere we wanted. Got a menu. We did not receive any or drinks or salsa and chips. Waited for 15 minutes no service. The waitress waited on two other tables that came in after us. And appeared to be having a social conversation with them. We after 15 minutes we left the restaurant. Do not waste your time stopping at this restaurant.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><userid>101820121183631215949<//userid>< Time>

<Text>My wife and I were starving from a busy day. We were running late, meaning most of the restaurants in our area close about 9pm moen -thurs, it was wed or thur nite. We went to a place across the street and they turned us away. Saying no we are closed. As soon as we walked out I saw the neon glow of the open sign. I said ah-ha they are open. My wife said the hours say closes at 9. Well it was 9:32pm to be exact, and I opened the door. There was a woman folding napkins and preparing silverware. I asked are you guys still open? She replied oh um, I forgot to turn off the sign we are close. Looking around I notice a party of 2 or 3 having their meal. So immediately I asked is the kitchen still open, we are really hungry and we would be very grateful with take out service not eat in. The kind woman said let me go check I'll b right back. My wife and I heard yes from the kitchen area. We both smiled at each other and sat at the table the woman directed us to. She said take out ok? Oh yes we both replied. We ordered our food which was Fish Burrito Dinner which came with beans and rice and we also order chips with salsa and extra guacamole.  The woman took our order offered us drinks my wife had ice tea and I requested a cup of ice just because I was walking with a jar of apple juice. We drank our drinks and our food was ready . The woman refilled our my wife's ice tea and brought me an ice tea for the road. She handed me our bill. It was inexpensive for all the food that was in our bags. I paid our bill and handed the woman a $10 bill for her tip.  I remember feeling like that was not enough for the service this woman had just offered my wife and I. As my wife and I were leaving we talked with the woman and thanked her for taking our business when she could have simply turned us away. My wife and I didn't make it home to eat we found the first bench we could sit on. And went to town on our food. It was awesome the fish Burritos were amazing. And I remember after I closed the lid of my takeout container I was literally stuffed to the gills. Lol, lol. The guacamole was perfect I could have eaten it alone without any chips or salsa. My wife could not finish her entire container. So we brought it home for our daughter's dog Cali Nibbles and she gave it 2 paws up. I took the chips and salsa as lunch the next day but the guacamole  never made it. Thank you for a wonderful experience and a chance to eat some incredible authentic Mexican food. I highly recommend this place for eat in or take out either way u will have an awesome meal. Thank you again to the woman who took us in and did not turn us away. Thank you and hope we see you again.</Text>< Pics>

Worse Mexican food in town i ordered half a chicken breast and got chicken strips and the Spanish rice was gross tasting, i asked for hot sauce and they didn't have any except for the mild salsa they serve with chips. What Mexican place doesn't have hot sauce?< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Delicious Mexican food with family treatment (maybe too familiar, hence I removed a star, being a bit bad).

(Original)
Riquísima comida mexicana con trato familiar (quizás demasiado familiar, de ahí que le quite una estrella, siendo un poco malo).<//text>

I was seriously interested in buying.  The guy there said that no one can transmit from the display.  He showed zero interest and even said that he does not operate himself.  I mentioned to my xyl that if the guy had been enthusiastic i definitely would have spent some money there..i really wanted to buy something...but alas i ran away with glee with money unspent.  A real shame after traveling so far to visit the store.</review>< Date>

< Review>
This is one of only a few remaining places not yet taken out by the internet. They have most of the popular and essential stuff, but no one store can carry everything in this hobby. The people are knowledgeable friendly and helpful they've given me great advice and set me up with just what I needed. Highly recommend.<//Review>

Poor customer service. I came in to ask a question about an item that the web site showed as out of stock. One guy was busy with a customer, that's fine. The other two didn't care enough to give me a serious answer about when it might be in. So I left. I came in with a plan to engage someone in a discussion, particularly to find alternatives to what I thought I wanted. I was willing to have them talk me into buying something else. Instead I got the brush off, so I went out to the web and mail ordered it from someone else. I would much rather deal locally, but with this kind of crummy treatment in person I might as well be dealing with computers. I don't expect salesmen to fawn over me, but I do expect them to pay attention when I'm talking to them.<//Review>

One of the worst places to go for HAM Radio gear or support, service is poor, staff is rude. I work with several hospitals and help with emergency communications I have sent a few hospitals to purchase equipment and they have received the worst treatment possible while spending thousands.
I and friends of mine have also experienced their brand poor service and bad attitude. They can go to HELL and I'll purchase my products and recommend that people buy their products from somewhere else even if it means out of State but a goggle search will show you one closer where people give better service.
5 negative stars is my rating ........< /Text>

Went in to get a keyer paddle .  Tom, KW6C, enthusiastically provided options that were available at HRO as well as other sources.  He wanted me to get the right paddle rather just making a sale.  I bought a paddle from HRO and also left with a lot of knowledge.  Even if you are unsure about what you need do not hesitate to go to HRO.  de AI6XG< /Review>

The staff is mostly dismissive at all HROs. Most of them are cranky jerks who don't have any customer service skills and act like typical Elmers. I'm sticking with buying things online just to avoid the ilk of HRO staff and customers. It's a new age and your owner needs to hire staff who understand business, service and who know enough to not be crabby a-holes. Too bad...I spend quite a bit monthly on gear and your company isn't getting any of my money until your business model and service standards improve enormously!< /text>

HRO, is the largest amateur radio dealer in the country, having stores all around the USA.
Most radios in stock,  have samples set up on an operating bench so you can try and use before buying. If  there is an amateur radio made, they sell  it, excepting manufactures that don't allow retail sales of their equipment.
the staff is very helpful, and very knowledgeable about all of the products and amateur radio. parking is on street in front of store, look for large white sign, and black lettered sign, on side of building. adjacent to a gun store.</Review>< rate>

Super kind service. You don't worry if it takes more time or less time to decide. Analyze, compare and buy what you need. They are really very polite and willing to help.

<rate>5<//rate><text>OMG this was my first visit here and it was so delicious ! I tried the fruit roll up icicles as well as the strawberry fantasy with whipped cream and mochi and that's what took the icing for me . SOOO BOMB. Fruit roll up was good it tasted like fruit but was a tad bit to sour for my preference. The strawberry fantasy reminded me of a baked good and it had a little crunch to it , I couldn't put it down . With covid they had us order inside and once you ordered you have to wait outside and they call you through a speaker once your order is ready. I will say it was on the pricey side but it deff gave me a good first impression to come back and try so more flavors !</text>< Response>

Interesting concept which i had only seen in videos online until this day. The ice cream tastes fine if the correct toppings are added.
The making of the rolls is definitely fun to watch.
Price wise i must say it is expensive. I mean this looks more a fancy thingy than having my full cup of icecream.< /text>

Awesome icecream!! My kids love it!! It's fun to watch them make. They have lots of flavors but the avocado one I love because it's not that sweet and you get that hint of avocado. The lines can get long but you will enjoy!!</Text>

It was a different experience!! Getting to see the ice cream being made in front of you was great. The taste was awesome and not too sweet. Even the ice cream was delicious, I could not imagine finishing the whole bowl myself!! The service was excellent, not much waiting either. We ordered Ferrari and Rock& Roll. I must say that the price is on the higher side.<//Review>

<rate>3< /rate><review>The ice cream is tasty and the ability to see it being made is pretty cool. My biggest gripe is the cost. While i appreciate all the toppings one can select from it also feels like it’s a way to make up for lacking natural taste and sweetness in the ice cream itself.<//review>< pictures>

Great ice cream and the service there is amazing. They'll let you split one order into two cups and you can even get different toppings on each. Love the ambiance too. Nice music playing and the place in really clean and decorated.< /Text>

It's ice cream made in front of your eyes. There is almost zero air in it as they make it on a frozen plate directly from cream and other ingredients using what look like wallboard tools. It's fun to watch and they have a great selection of predefined flavors.

At the end you can choose toppings. The portions are generous and the ingredients fresh and good quality.

It's not cheap but where else can you have ice cream made to order?< /Text>

Great ice cream! My favorite is the Bravacado - fresh avocado with condensed milk and cream, chopped, mixed, flattened, & rolled. Add whatever toppings you want, all included! Great service too!</review>

<Review>Good ice cream but short of staff. I think it's craziness to wait almost an hour for an ice-cream. Request to owners-Don't be stingy. Get an extra staff. Or franchise should open a location close by. I am not going back to same location until I see better reviews with changes.< /Review>< Pictures>

I have to call this store as ICE CREAM ROLLS rather than icicles.

Based on your selection from the menu, all the Ingredients are mixed, smashed over and over, made into a big sheet, then Cut and rolled into smaller sheets and served with toppings( as many toppings as you want). They take around 2 min to make each icicle.
Each icicle is $7.75.  Very Expensive compared to other ice cream stores.

Bravacado tastes bad and doesn't even feel like a dessert.
Rock n roll icicle with banana and caramel tasted much better.

P.S. Don't fall into the trap of avocado, while ordering desserts.
Go junk to enjoy a better taste ..!

< Review>
I would like to send a HUGE shout out to the baby ward staff. Jason and I had our little miracle on Christmas Day and the stay there and care was outstanding. With the Corona pandemic going on ,we were worried like everyone else, but the hospital staff was so professional, kept everything sterilized and safe. We both were fed during our stay and taught some helpful tips and tricks about being new parents. I also liked that a lot of the staff have been there for many years. That’s a great sign of not only being treated well by the hospital but also by their teammates. When the nurses had their shift changes, they communicated very well with one another and our needs. They all knew what was going on and we were very calm during our stay. I was very pleased with how they were like family with each other and made us feel like family. It was hard for us to leave the hospital but we had to go learn how to be a family of 3. We definitely will cherish the memories that were made at St Rose hospital. I recommend that if you’re in the area and are having a baby..... check out St Rose hospital. Thank you all so much and 5 stars to all of you! ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Stay healthy and safe< /Review>

<text>My mom was brought to the emergency room for the first time so everything was new to me.. Aside from being terribly worried I was a little anxious. I understand that it's tough working in a hospital let alone in an emergency and they go through the stress often but what they are forgetting is that  a lot of the families there - it's their first time. First time in that hospital, first time to bring a loved one to the emergency room.

They lady who was at the desk - security who was working around 9pm - 10:30pm on 5/19/2021 was so rude.It's as if she expected me to know where to go and what to do. For someone who is the first one to receive people, patients, she is rude and NOT very welcoming.< /text><gmapID>0x808f96a6421d7c1b:0xcd79ebdcb5bc9fbf< /gmapID><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

Waited 3 hours on a hospital bed not one person checked on me and it wasn’t even busy. Nurses all grouped together talking about tiktok in the next room over. St. Rose hospital is a joke. Everyone there should be fired.< /Text>

Seems like they are trying to kill my brother. Unfortunately, the EMT recommended St Rose over Eden so care home said ok. Now it seems like he's going to have to die to get him moved out of there. The doctors and nurses don't call when they are making major changes to his care and finding major problems. They have poor records and can't tell if tasks have even been performed until after a report is finalized (and they sometimes just don't bother to do that).</text>

Great little hospital. Staff in ED and ward don't practice good infection control. Staff are casual with speech in clinical areas, patients can hear conversations. Staff should be encouraged to speak English to each other in clinical settings, not in own languages, very unprofessional.</Text>

If you are not dying but in pain, this is not a place for you to attend. I had a serious hand cut and it was very deep that I exposed my tissue and muscle in the air for almost 3 hours to get it fixed. Most medical staff was friendly, but I still waited a little bit to finish everything and leave. I was there from 12:30 pm to almost 5 pm to get stitches. They might ran out of the employees, that was why it took me that long.</Review>< Pics>

Worst hospital experience ever. Very rude, unfriendly nurses who did not care if I was in pain after major surgery. They didn't give my medication as scheduled, even when asked for it. I was treated like a huge inconvenience, even though I had just had surgery.  I had to go back for a post op infection, all my labs and cultures were somehow lost. I ended up going to Eden where they actually handled my pain and took care of my post op infections. I would not recommend this hospital to anyone. I seriously regret having surgery there.< /text>

<Review>St Rose has to be the WORSE hospital ever. You're better off going to a hospital in a third world country.  The lack of concern and treatment is horrible. The Nurse's and Doctors there do not seem like they take any concern in what is going on. The Nurse who inserted my IV, literally had my blood squirting every where. Another down side is the place is ghetto, with old equipment.< /Review>< Rating>

My son had 99f temperature and his forehead was very hot for 3 days than usual. They made us wait 3 hours with xray,  nose swab, urine test. In the end they gave Tylenol with ice water and discharged him . Then came the bill $420 from CEP and from Carson $2020.
I fixed my son's problem at home with herbal medicine. Wished I never went there,  despite having Health net insurance.
Unless it's a matter of life and death, I will never go there or take my love ones.</text>

<Text>This is the worst hospital I have ever experienced. The staff is beyond incompetent. The nurses are inexperienced and pay no attention to detail. The doctors are either too busy or too arrogant to be truly helpful and partner with the patient for optimum results and health. 3 of MANY similar examples: 1. My father's roommate was taken for tests. When he arrived, they started opening his gown at the chest. He questioned them and asked them why they were doing this. The response was so they could check his heart. His response was, "I am here for my feet, not my heart," to which they asked, for the first time, if his name was Mr. X (my father). 2: the nurse was taking my father's vitals. One of her questions was to ask if he was having any blurred vision. She failed to see the HUGE sign above his bed stating that the patient was legally blind. 3: The nurse came in to give my father a shot. One of us questioned this and said he just had a shot of the same medicine about 10m ago. She checked her screen and said "Oh, you're right, I didn't check the chart". Unacceptable! I truly believe if we were not there every day their incompetence would have killed him. There are many more examples I could give. It's like a hospital full of staff that was rejected from every other hospital. The cardiology doctors will save your life and then the care giving from that point on will kill you. DO NOT go her if you can avoid it.<//Text>< Pictures>

Today on my fifth day of being held hostage here Wilma the nursing assistant asked me if I would like to clean up. For the first time she got a towel, wash cloth and soap for me. My oncologist says I should've been able to go home 2 days ago as far as he is concerned. Staff MD will not communicate to him or me why I am still here. There is more to write but this should give an idea of the poor patient care here. RNs Jay and Kiran have been excellent.< /review>

<Review>The phellapeno MA in v.Economou office is so insensitive and rude. She over talks patients, hangs up with out listening then gets mad when she misses important information. I hate dealing with this office because of her. She'll let you die or go without medication. Don't miss your appointment or she'll schedule you purposely 2 months out. If you need immediate assistance she never passes information over to the doctor so don't leave a message. Even if you're at the pharmacy and they're waiting on a response.. forget it it's pointless. Some body better mellow this MA out before someone dies from her arrogant attitude.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<review>Thought I was the only one that had something negative to say, but after reading other reviews I am not alone. Ive never been treated so poorly in my life, the staff talked more than they helped me. Talk about rude! they were so mean and it just felt like they didn't want to be there. I couldn't wait to get out of there. It was like they had it out for me, but there was another lady present and she got a warm welcome, it was really bizarre and I wouldn't recommend anyone going here.

<review>I think they deserve 3 star for now, only for Nurse Phil and the doctor who saw me. My last visit was great. I dont remember the doctor's name, she was an asian, she explained really well about my headache, medication and possible cause to it. But I was really overwhelmed by nurse - Phil, He was really nice, calm, explained everything about the what he was going to do. I told him, I am scared of IV, he was telling me stories about tibetan people and how he knew his tibetan family friend in Palo Alto. I almost forgot the pain. When I think of St. Rose, I remember Nurse Phil. Thank you Phil.
Although my first visit - when I dropped a brick on my my toe, I had to wait for a long time to finish the entire process. It took about more than 4 hours just to dress infected area and get me a protection shoe for my toe. I waited so much there i saw patient came over, died in front of me and taken the body for burrial or I dont know. When I asked a doctor, who looked like indian, although didn't have an accent, doesn't have hospitality; how much time will it take to get my protection shoe, he was like " If they haven't got back to you yet, that means they might be dealing with more urgent issues, so wait". I was like what a rude way of explaining your patient. I thought I would never come back.< /review><GmapID>0x808f96a6421d7c1b:0xcd79ebdcb5bc9fbf< /GmapID><resp>None<//resp>< Rating>

<Text>Went here this weekend for a tour of the birthing center. I called several times to confirm that the tour would take place on friday night at 7. It was Halloween so I wanted to be sure. You don't register for the tour, so I called several times to make sure that it would still be happening. I arrived at 6:50 and waited 45 minutes. Finally at 7:35 (with about 8 other pregnant couples there) I asked the reception desk if she would kindly call the birthing center to see what was happening. I could her say, "Oh, so you forgot?" "You'r just to busy?" "Well, you need to come down here and tell them, I don't want all these people mad at me". I felt bad for her. About 5 minutes later a nurse came down to tell us, the tour was cancelled and we could come back next time. A few of the very pregnant moms complained... "uhh my baby is due in 2 weeks. That won't work!" She called upstairs again and said we could take a quick tour. They were so "busy" that 3 nurses had the time to give us a tour of the mostly empty floor. 8 birthing rooms and 9 recovery rooms. If they are busy you share a labor room. Not cool. Only one of the labor rooms has a shower, the rest do not. Shared showers are located in the hallway, but you can't use them if you are in labor.. unless "your labor is picture perfect" as the rude nurse told me. Once the baby is born, the shots and bath are done in the nursery, not your own room. The labor rooms were very spacious and 2 of the nurses that gave the tour were very nice. But one was very rude. I am glad I took the tour, I defiantly DO NOT want to have my baby here! This will be my 4th baby and I was very disappointed with the level of this birthing center.</Text><Date>1415031652229</Date>< gmap_id>

I'll give 0 star if i could. Really unhappy , every patient deserve respect we pay for doctors service nothing is free. Hopefully a manager see this comment. I went in around 2pm .</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Review>I went to st rose hospital since I had serious neck pain at 8 pm.
Waited 3 hours in emergency to meet doctor!!
The doctor checked me in a hall way (though I got a bill for emergency room).
He prescribed some tablets, but they dont have pharmacy (or pharmacy doesnt work 24 hrs). By the time I came out of hospital, its too late and all pharmacies in 15 miles radius were closed. Had a wonderful night.

That was part one of experience.

I had a pretty good insurance provided by company. After a month, I got the bill, the amount I had to pay was huge!! so surprised to see that. I wanted to pay online, so called the hospital. The "bills/payment" department never picked the call (atleast I tried 7 times in different days). Finally paid bill by visiting hospital.  After a month, I got another bill (with due date 1.5 month back), which was from "drpaycenter". I wasnt sure what was it because Its the first time visiting a hospital in US. Decided to call hospital again.. tried ~5 times, no answer from bill department. Then I figured it out that its doctors bill. I paid it online. Again I got another bill from drpaycenter for same amount. To verify I logged in their site, the amount still due!!. First thing that came to my mind is its a fraud. So I called st rose hospital again to check what is this. Fortunately they picked, but the answer was they are not sure, it might be a real bill. Then I called the drbillpay, the said its duplicate bill and it takes weeks (months may be) to see the update in their site after making an online payment.

I was one the most frustrating experience I had in last few years. Lost money, didnt get medication on time, lost some credit score (bcz of drbillpay), spend 3 hours  waiting in hospital, made atleast 20 calls attempts, spent countless hours of time thinking of this.

All I can tell now is "I will never go to that hospital again.. its not worth".</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I have no complaints! When you use the free or paid medical service in Brazil, this hospital seems like paradise, I see so many people here complaining, of course, complaints are valid, but in a third world country health is precarious, here maybe the nurses need to be more human, most polite but overall the service is quality, fast and I consider it cheap.

Não tenho nenhuma reclamação! Quando você usa o serviço médico gratuito ou pago do Brasil esse hospital parece o paraíso, vejo tanta gente aqui reclamando, claro, reclamações são válidas, mas em um país de terceiro mundo a saúde é precária, talvez aqui as enfermeiras precisam ser mais humanas, mais educadas, mas no geral o serviço é de qualidade, rápido e considerei barato.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiVZ3haBdT8QSTdpfitqjz3gvqYN_YsVsJvvTP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

<review>So knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful! From the moment I walked in, they treated me like family! And speaking of family, the owner was nice enough to give my nephews a in depth tour and explanation of all of his animals! He went above and beyond for us.

They take amazing care of the animals. Tanks are clean, fish are happy, and the place smells clean!

I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone who wants to get good information and quality products for their aquarium.<//review>< Pics>

Wow! These guys are awesome. My wife and I just started a new Reef Aquarium and the guys here have been amazingly helpful. The tanks and facility are super clean. They have a great selection of corals and fish. I live 20 miles away but I will continue coming here for all my fish needs.<//text>

First time there. Was really impressed with the frags selection. I’ve been to just about every aquatic store in the inland empire and have not seen a layout like this one! 👌🏽 The store attendant Ken was super cool very humble person and generous. I recommend this shop 100%<//Review>

I have been coming here for 2 years now.  The guys who run it are good guys that have great customer service. Clean tanks, great selection of healthy fish and coral.  Also, they always have a lot of eels and a big leopard shark which my kids love.  Check them out.</review>

Really enjoy the staff here, incredibly knowledgeable. Great price on incredibly healthy coral. Also I am a huge fan of the water they sell; they make their own saltwater an it's incredibly clean.</Text>

Me and my husband have been coming here for a while now. The fish are top quality and we are always satisfied with the service they provide. The tanks are very clean and the fish are handpicked by the owner. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.</review>

<review>5/5 stars! Best fish store in the Inland empire by far! Customer service is excellent and great selection of healthy corals and fish. If you need anything from new equipment or exotic fish don’t hesitate to visit Ocean Aquatics in Redlands. Staff is very knowledgeable and friendly with affordable prices. Highly recommend this store to anyone!< /review>< pictures>

<Text>I think they do their best sourcing healthy fish and hand select their livestock. Both Ken and Brian are knowledgeable and helpful. I think they supply the highest quality water in the area. I take half a star as they don’t carry a good selection of food (you won’t find reef nutrition, lrs, or piscene energetics).  The other half a star as they don’t stock or use any equipment such as the apex, ghl, tunze, clarisea, Red Sea products, etc. lastly, their tanks used to be spotless, but now even their coral tank has tons of algae on the frags themselves. Overall, a good store  with huge potential!<//Text><name>Carlos Flores</name>< Rating>

It was my first time in their facility and it was first class impressive. The store was clean and well kept.

Ken welcomed me with such knowledgeable  answers to my questions. He was real courteous towards me.

I also met Brian who was also very informative and courteous as well.

Overall, I had an excellent experience and reccomend Ocean Aquatics to my friends and family.< /Review>

Most coral looked fairly healthy which is a plus. Removed first star because there where a lot of dead and sick fish and a few corals where bleached. An employee was trying to push people to buy a fish with lateral line disease.(I understand not everyone is knowledgeable) second star removed for lack of being professional.. I was looking to add a fish and a few corals to my reef tank and just asked a few questions about if they treat the fish (copper and such) or if they do one week hold on fish like some of the other stores because I dont want to introduce a sick fish to my system.. the person I was talking to could not or would not answer the question and insisted  I was starting trouble and that I should leave.. for one I probably will never go there again but for the most part they did have a good amout of healthy looking coral and a pretty good selection.</review>

<Review>We just started our first salt water tank. This store has been AMAZING at answering all of our question (open or not they have ways for you to contact them). Our tank is coming together well and all of their information has helped bolster our little community. THIS IS THE ONLY STORE I WILL GO TO...and drive 30 miles one way to get there.</Review></record>

<Text>This is the place to go for your Marine addiction! I have been to quite a few aquatic shops in the Inland Empire and as a reef keeper this place has me coming back time after time. The shop has the most diverse collection of corals and fish I have ever seen with the best prices. The owners are both knowledgeable and very friendly which is a hard thing to come by now days as I have experienced. All of the tanks and livestock are well maintained and the store is extremely clean! Whether it be you're interested in starting your first marine tank or your a hard core enthusiast I highly recommend checking this LFS out!<//Text><Name>Anthony Pearson< /Name><rating>5< /rating><Date>1521236126989</Date><gmap_id>0x80dcaa44da6de8dd:0xe36bed38ac0cefa0</gmap_id></record>

I go to these guys for RO water for my freshwater tanks. I'm not at all familiar about saltwater but their RO ALWAYS reads 0 on my TDS reader. All the employees are friendly and even ask about my tanks each week I come in. Great place!< /Review>

Ken and brian really care about your tank and fish. Ken spent 30+ mins with me just talking about possible issues in my tank. No up sales! They want your fish to live just as bad as you do so listen to their knowledge!< /Text>

The kitchen staff works fast here! They are handling the increased drive thru activity well. My order has been accurate and good quality. I even heard the manager see a burrito that had been prepared tell the cook to add more chicken before wrapping it. Nice to see quality control happening.<//text>

< Review>
The food is great, and the drive-thru usually moves at a decent pace. One of the better Del Tacos I've been to. Got short-changed on some carne asada fries once with a severe lack of carne asada, but I'll honestly most likely return due to my love of the food. (Pic for ref (my fries vs my wife's)).< /Review>

<review>We stopped here for lunch and got their Tostada's and they were great! The flat shell was nice and crispy and sturdy like they should be and didn't taste stale like they had been sitting in grease for to long. I had the chicken and guacamole tosada and it was loaded with flavorful items like chicken, guacamole, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, beans, sour cream and red sauce. It was awesome! My wife had their basic tosada which had beans, cheese, lettuce, red sauce and she said it was great also. Taco Bell's tosadas were never this good and always got soggy and broke while eating them. Even if Taco Bell still had theirs we would only choose Del Taco from now on, however, since Taco Bell quit making these and the Mexican pizzas, we'll go to Del Taco for everything now.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

I’ve lived in Bakersfield for over 2 years now so I know that the quality of fast food is lacking but this place is the worst. I’m used to the cold old fries and never getting the extra cheese in my burrito that I’ve asked and paid for, but this was the first time I had cold AND soggy tacos. The beef was colder than the cheese and lettuce.<//text>

Yesterday was our first time we went to this good restaurant. But It is surely not the last. We passed a splendid evening with the good service, with the first-rate  meal and booze and with the modest price. We will definitely come back soon.</Text>

Would give it 0 stars but it wouldn't allow. The manager should be fired. Was rude to me and my step son because we didn't know the drink machine was broke and didn't specifically ask for the flavor of drink we wanted. Corporate if you read this it's your store on Rosedale in Bakersfield.< /text>

<rate>4<//rate><review>We went inside to order due to drive thru being too busy. We ordered two burritos, tacos and a quesadilla, as well as drinks. We got everything as ordered after waiting only a few minutes. There is no inside dining at this time. It was clean inside and plenty of people working. The manager that served us was polite. The food was good and priced well. Parking is bad when the drive thru is packed.<//review><user>114395600559267752012<//user><time>1605948166067</time>< Name>

There is almost many kids playing around and inside playground too. Workers are so more paitence with kids. If you have kids and need to see your kids play and good cooperate with del taco workers. Come here on Rosedale Highway. Of course, workers there for adults too. Good place to view many cars pass away on Rosedale Highway. Sometimes loud with motorcycle/car machine.< /Text>

<review>Walking in we had to wait to be helped for about 10 minutes, customer service was great until we told her we wanted a different side than what she had changed us for. Then we get our food. It was nasty! Burnt food, hard rice and on top of that the cheese in my quesadillas was not even melted. We get home and my husband and myself are both puking.. would definitely not recommend..< /review>< Pictures>

I was not happy. I had the chili cheese fries. it tasted gross it was very Bland I added ketchup hot sauce in anything I could to give it flavor. I had a dollar float the orange soda had no flavor I asked for a refill twice different flavors all the syrup must have drained out the machine because it all tastes the same like fizzled water. I was so disappointed</text>

Well it's not bad, but certainly not great. Some items are good like their street tacos while some others you would be better off going somewhere else for. But that's dependent upon your taste buds. I was debating between giving this place 3 or 4 stars and ultimately settled for a 4 star rating because of their healthy options and their food being relatively cheap.

If there's anything the try first here if you do visit, try their street tacos.</review>

Lacking.. Told they don’t serve bacon and egg quesadillas any more and did not seem enthusiastic about making it.. Seems like they rushed it.. Fries had an old frying oil taste..  This is not a Barstow Del Taco..</text>

Beyond avocado tacos were great. 10/10 for the flavor.  The interior isn't very inviting. Trash everywhere, most tables weren't cleaned. Most people aren't eating inside so kind of understandable. I had a good experience overall.<//Text>

Tacos weren't very good. It was decent though. I like taking my kid here so when she's done eating, she can play in the play area.</Review>

I was very upset. She was more concerned with the drive thru  and letting us stand there for a good ten minutes then we finally got our order and had to go back and get everything they forgot to put with our order to top it off the girl that was doing the front counter and drive thru had an attitude about the stuff they had to get for us that they forgot to put on our tray. And there was only one couple there when we got there already eating when we got our food it was cold.very very 😡<//review>

<Text>They are alright here. The people working there are business like, and not really rude. If I'm going to spend my money, I personally prefer friendly people with smiles waiting on me, and that's why I don't go there much and that's sad. But the food is always good and freshly made and hot.<//Text>< pictures>

I asked for NO SALT on my fries my 70 year old mother has high blood pressure and heart problems. She loves the fries here. The fries handed out to us were full of salt I told the manager Delanie and she treated us like it was our fault. I wasn’t going to leave a review but after reading on here I guess a lot of customers are having a problem with her. Hopefully she is fired. SHe is horrible talking to people. Treats people like an animal. I will never come back to this Del taco again sorry.</Review>

My first visit u ordered two chicken burritos. They were small with almost no meat. Never have I received such a small item from them. Usually a decent burrito but I suspect they are under portioning compared to other locations. Second time I visited received two double del burgers. No flavor at all and patties had burnt edges. Disappointing compared to the past experiences I've had.<//Text>

This location is GREAT!! 💞 The only problem I have is that the California Ave location doesn't process debit card transactions in real time. My husband's account wasn't debited until about 3 days later and because he didn't know this and thought it was already taken out of the bank, the late purchase caused his bank account to go into the negative and with NSF fees! Thankfully the bank reversed all the fees.  We have decided not to go to this location anymore because of this. Beware!< /text>

Delanie our cashier did not greet us or even ask us if she could take our order she just stood there. We finally get our order and it’s cold everything was cold we take it back to the counter and they ask us what part of it was cold.. uhhmm everything.. our family loves Del Taco and I am sorry to say we will not be coming here again.<//Text>< pics>

< Review>
Tonight I’m giving it a 1 star! They are usually good. Whoever is in the kitchen putting the food together on November 21st 2017 at 11:05pm is an idiot! I ordered food with NO TOMATOES. The guy that took the order and repeated it back correctly. I get home and there are tomatoes all over everything!! And they didn’t give me my fries I paid for!!! Needless to say I’m pissed of!! I go to this Del Taco often and the service is usually good. So much for the kitchen worker on duty tonight.<//Review>

Went to the Rosedale location I won't be back first I saw the lady spill my nacho cheese and heard her tell her co worker just poor the rest in another container but before that she was about to out it in the bag I am already feeling like crap so I let it go and went home pulled out the nacho cheese and looks so gross it even smells nasty! I understand they're working on thanksgiving and probably hate it but still serve people food they won't get sick on!< /Review>

Del Taco in Tehachapi is the ABSOLUTE WORST PLACE EVER!!!!! It is extremely filthy,  the employees are rude, cold food & the SLOWEST service EVER!!! The last two times we were in there, we waited 20 minutes to be helped & we only had one person in front of us!! We walked out & nobody cared, even the manager saw us leaving & didn't care!!! NEVER, EVER had worse food or service!!!!!! HEALTH DEPARTMENT PLEASE CLOSE THEM DOWN!!!!! Put in a El Pollo Loco or Chipotle in it's place!!<//review>

Morning service is fine. But GOD FORBID you order a burger in the evening. THEIR GRILL IS ALWAYS DOWN, for some odd reason. This has happened twice now. We go in at 7:30 pm and they have their grills off for the day??? Completely unacceptable.< /Text>

My shredded soft tacos were not prepared well. The cheese was all over, and cold. No taste whatsoever. The restaurant floor was dirty. Waste of $7.50. Never going back to that location.< /Text>

was excited to see the carnitas back... but given the service is terrible (poor demeanor, forget food in your order, etc) I really have nothing good to say about it here. Called the store after I got home and found out they forgot my food (not the first time) I was left on hold while she validated my order (because I'm just trying to get free nachos right?) Not only did I now have to drive all of the way back to pick them up, I was not greeted, in fact they seemed annoyed that I was there and the lady making them ran out of sour cream and rather than getting more just put a lid on it and passed it out. I was then told "sorry" by the same woman who couldn't greet me and had the same poor, pissed off look on her face. Customer service is definitely not a strong suit here and as this isn't the first time I've ran into these attitudes and lack of care I won't be back.<//text>

The kid helping me had to write my order down, his shift manager refused to take his hood off while talking to us. They closed out the register as we ordered and took a bit to take our payment. Really unprofessional service and they acted very childish in front of many other customers.< /Text>

We did not have our two large fries on our order. I went back to buy them but at this time Irene had a franchisee who was training there bring me out the large fries. I left a review for him, but he had informed me it was all Irene. I wanted to say thank you personally from me to you Irene. Thank you!<//review>< pics>

Even though they looked swamped both inside and at the drive-up, your wait time was minimal with fresh, completely cooked, looking & tasting great food. I couldn't believe it that I got such great food & service during the lunchtime rush(12:20pm) that at dinnertime (6:45pm) after waiting for over 10 minutes at nearby hamburgerstand we decided to try our luck with them again. Well they lived up to the reputation that pleased us with the lunchtime crew with a different crew working the dinner shift, we left with our tummies full and smiles on our faces. Here's a place that the employees don't get tips usually, (we did tip them all that night)and most of them only make minimum wage, yet they kept the dining area cleaned & whipped down, bathrooms immaculate, food was fresh, hot and delicious and the whole time they pleasant to talk to and most importantly a smile on their faces. I wish that the establishment on that block that we tried on  a special occasion a few months back which cost $$$$ and the service along  with the cleanliness all need to take lessons from here. By the way we each had a couple of their shrimp taco special. YUM, YUM, YUM!🎉🎉<//Review>< pics>

A good fast food taco. Queso dip is pretty tasty as well. Though staff and management badly need to review handwashing/gloves/sanitation procedures.
UPDATE: my new favorite fast food restaurant. I have eaten here for breakfast, lunch and dinner now. I always receive high quality food with excellent service. Other than the above mentioned experience with the gloves, I can find little to complain about! Food is delicious! Everytime.<//Text>

Their tortillas are always dry on the ends. Their sauce is usually always in the bottom of the burrito when you're eating it and they don't feel their one pound burritos with very much at all.</text>

One of the ladies that works in the drive thru was rude the fact that you guys don’t accept 50$ bills she said straight we don’t accept 50s with an annoyed face, got me mad like at least have a sign outside the drive thru stating u don’t accept 50’s im just wasting my lunch break and as well as yours... not going back ...someone fix her attitude 👎🏼< /text>

<Review>25 minutes for 4 tacos and 2 burritos.
Got home 5 miles away, wrong burritos that were someone else's customer order.
It was only 4pm om a Sat and our wait wasn't even at back of line, but at the window.
Would have given another star if order had been what was on receipt and read back as bags were handed out.</Review></record>

I had an ok experience dining in at this Particular Del Taco. I had originally ordered 3 burritos without cheese just beans. I ended up getting 3 bean and cheese. Which was a mistake and to me it was no problem sometimes mess ups happen. However after I had let them know the order was wrong. After they fixed the problem I recieved the burritos with 3 tortillas burnt and toasted unlike the original soft tortillas that is usually given. I still ate them because it really didnt bother me to much however it felt like they did it on purpose cause I had told then the order was wrong.< /text>

<Text>I have been to the rosedale location many times and have always received horrible service. I only order through the drive thru, and today it is 3:18 pm with 12 drivers waiting for food and I have been in line  for over 20 minutes. I will probably not come here anymore. It is extremely frustrating ordering when the woman who takes my order never is able to understand what I say and overtalks me every time!  Yes, the food here is super cheap but not worth my sanity. I wish I didn't have to put any stars!<//Text><date>1458512439569</date><Rate>1<//Rate><gmap_id>0x80ea43ad3c6fb1f7:0x397dad7918c948ac</gmap_id>< resp>

I bought their new nachos meal for my 90 year old mother who asked me to get her a take out macho nacho, but I was told they don't sell them anymore, but have this other one instead. My mother told me to never go there again, bc it was so nasty, she threw it away. So goodbye Del Taco.< /text>
