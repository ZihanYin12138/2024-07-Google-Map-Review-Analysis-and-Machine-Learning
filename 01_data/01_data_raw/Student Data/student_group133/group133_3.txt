Amazing German food, super tasty and very light, if German food can be. Got the trout and pork roll. The trout was very well made with good flavor, spinach side was perfect. The pork roll was amazing, very nice fat content and great chew and sauce. The potato salad was on point with the cucumber slices. Also their tartar sauce was amazing, it's more sauce than paste like most places.</Text>

< review>
I inquired about adopting a 8 month old shepherd and filled out an application online.  I owned a shepherd for 13 years and he passed away in July.  I am a homeowner with a full time job and my house has a 1/2 acre fenced yard.

I was shocked when the representative called me and said my application was denied! She said it was denied because on the application I said the dog would be outside (in the huge yard) during the day and inside the house at night.  I answered this way because the dog will not be confined in a small house all day.  I put on the application my girlfriend would be home during the day with the dog.  I tried to explain to the rep my girlfriend would let the dog in and out of the house as he pleases but she wasn’t hearing it.  She lectured me about how a dog is supposed to be part of the family and inside all day like her dogs.  She finished by telling me I would never be able to adopt from them and she recommended I check a municipal shelter or buy one from a breeder.  What a joke.  I try to adopt a dog and give him a amazing life ( like I gave my previous shepherd for 13 years) and she tells me to go to a breeder yet they advertise they need more donations and willing people to adopt.  Unbelievable<//review>

I adopted a puppy from GSROC last summer, and I can't say enough good things about the organization, the adoption experience, and my baby. First, this organization is such an asset to the region. They save so many German Shepherds and other dogs who would otherwise die in public shelters. Second, from start to finish, the adoption process was professional and smooth. GSROC has wonderful volunteers who are available, helpful, and diligent. Third, and definitely saving the best for last, my puppy is the AMAZING. He is a big beautiful purebred who is calm, smart, and everything a GSD should be. I give GSROC an A+!< /Text>

We love GSROC almost as much as we love our new pup. They were extraordinarily accommodating and it’s clear they always put the dogs in their care, first. I would highly recommend these guys if you want a dog that’s right for you. Thanks GSROC!<//text>

I love everything about this restaurant. It's in a great neighborhood, the food is incredible, and the atmosphere is... well, it's unusual. Unless you come with a party of 6 be prepared to share a table with strangers. There really isn't much space between tables, so occasionally you'll be aware of the people at the table next to you, as well. That's the closest to a negative that I can come up with, and the food more than makes up for whatever discomfort that might cause.< /review>

If you want a good German food experience, come here. Great beer selection, solid German food, and a great vibe. Came here for dinner at 8 and had a little bit of a wait but das bier totally helped. Can't wait to come back here again.</text>

< Review>
This rescue is not really looking to find the right dog for you. They just want the money for a dog they picked up from a shelter for free. If you don't want to be pressured, this is not the place for you. We met 3 dogs, fostered one for them and even donated supplies for them.

When we didn't like the fact they had another potential family waiting to see a dog after us and we weren't comfortable making a decision with that type of pressure, they said we were too difficult to make a match with and now refuse to respond to us. They won't even give us a receipt for the more than $100 of dog food, collar, toys and other stuff we donated.

They just want to make quick flips with dogs they "rescued" from shelters. Felt like a used car deal and there was no recourse if you got a lemon. They like having their hands out for money and donations,, but when it comes to truly helping a family that has a toddler find the right dog they just dismiss you completely.

There are much better options for finding your next family member. Go somehwere else!<//Review>

<Text>I have made an aplicación for a puppy and an email was sent to me asking where would the dog sleep. . My response was I would prefer him indoors but if he wanted to be outside it would be ok. Their next response was my application was denied because they want all their dogs to have space to sleep inside preferably next to the person adopting.. I’m pretty sure they can come up with some better excuse..</Text></record>

< Review>
GSROC is by far the best rescue I have seen. The dogs are well taken care of and clean. Volunteers are knowledgeable about the dogs in their care and therefore able to match them up with prospective families nicely. I have personal experience with GSROC as I adopted my fur baby from them in 2006. I will always go back to them when looking for a new family member. Thank you so much for doing well you do and saving so many dogs.<//Review>

I really love the wonderful, kind folks at the GSROC.  After losing an elderly shepherd I'd had for 16 years, I simply asked them to recommend a sweet and loving dog.  Sadie is the very definition of sweet and loving. That was 2 years ago.  Last month we decided Sadie needed a brother, and we found Toast.  He had never been tested with cats, but when I expressed interest, the GSROC volunteers dropped everything and brought him to our home to give it a try -- within hours of our phone call!  They were so nice and really concerned with finding a right fit -- for us and for the dog.  You know if a dog is with a rescue, he's been through some trauma, but we have found two of the greatest dogs ever, thanks to GSROC & we are so grateful to them!< /review>

<Text>I would like to respond to the review posted by Rachel Weaver.
As an active volunteer, I can personally guarantee that what this person has written in her first two sentences could not be any further from the truth. GSROC pays to spay or neutered every dog that comes into the rescue ; pays to board the dogs at a private boarding facility, and pays for good quality food & supplements while the dog is in their care.  These are the expenses for a healthy dog. Now, when they bring in a sick dog (which is done regularly) GSROC also pays all the vet bills to get the dog healthy before the dog is placed. Typically, GSROC pays a significantly higher amount of $$ to take care of the dog,  then what is asked for as an adoption donation. To suggest GSROC is “flipping dogs for financial gain” is completely ludicrous. And reflects an uninformed individual.

This particular family needed a GSD with very specific characteristics. They needed a dog to be good with a toddler and a smaller dog. Plus they wanted a specific size and color. Over the course of several months, the rescue carefully selected, talked to the family, showed pictures, discussed temperament, and upon the families agreement, showed this family at least 5 dogs/puppies that were a match. However, with each pup, they declined the dog for one reason or another. Including a beautiful, calm, friendly female that bonded with the child and husband almost immediately. They passed on her because of her COLOR. Weeks later, The family came to an adoption event where they “fell in love” with a dog. GSROC  needed to have them bring their dog to the kennel for a meet & greet to evaluate compatibility. They did that the following day and volunteers observed the dogs were completely compatible. However, the family would not commit to adopt the dog but wanted to foster her instead. At that time, there was another family waiting to meet this dog. Since the Weaver family was not willing to adopt the dog, the rescue moved on to showing that dog to the other family, who adopted her.< /Text><Rating>4</Rating></record>

We adopted our dog from GSROC 4 years ago.  I have also been volunteering for almost 6 years.  This rescue is committed to finding a permanent home for each and every dog.  They are thorough in their home checks and questioning, to ensure that every dog gets the best possible home.  They are committed to working with adopters on training and continue to be available to help with transitioning.  I love this rescue and the people who volunteer.</text>

GSROC was very quick to get back to us when we put in a request for more information about Chip (now Charlie). They were thorough about the house check and once we were approved we drove up to Orange County with the whole family and our older dog to meet him. They answered all our questions and worked well with us. We will recommend GSROC to anyone who is looking for a German Shepherd and we will return to them when we are ready to rescue another one. Thank you!<//review>

Told us a dog was up for adoption that we wanted, then after we arrived saw us and changed their minds? Wonder what the reason was? In addition to making comments about my son whom has Autism... They never even visited our home or took time to get to know us. Go to a place that has doesn’t judge upon appearance but cares about finding animals a safe and loving home with safe and loving families.</Text>

If you are looking to adopt a German Shepherd, these are the people.  We are on our 4th dog from them.  Maria personally came out to Yorba Linda, and spent hours with us, looking for the perfect dog.  We had just lost our 12 year old Shepherd, and adopted a wonderful 4 year old, that brings love and joy to us everyday.

2 years later, Rita is still eager to help with any questions or needs.

I have worked with and known this rescue for almost 30 years
They are the most efficient and well run animal rescue I’ve ever known.
Maria, Rita, Shawn and the volunteers will go to any length 24 hours a day to rescue a German Shepherd

Thanks to GSROC, I am a first time dog owner! I had a phenomenal experience working with them in finding a great fit for myself and also the dog. GSROC takes good care of their dogs and provides all the resources needed (such as additional training) to ensure that their dogs are friendly and well behaved.

After completing a very thorough application, Maria from GSROC reached out to me and suggested that I meet with JJ since he was a calm German Shepherd and would be great for a first timer like me. During the meeting, I quickly found that he was too big for myself and my girlfriend. We weren’t sure we’d be able to handle this big boy, so Maria brought out another dog. Much to our surprise, she brought out a 2 year old husky pup - Juneau! He was a perfect size for us and we quickly agreed to foster him. We were given everything we needed to take care of him.

After we took him home, Maria arranged private training sessions for us so that Juneau’s stubborn behavior could improve. After a month, there’s a huge difference in his self-control and obedience. Juneau became irresistible to us and we decided to adopt him. Gabi with GSROC helped answer my many questions regarding the adoption process.

GSROC provided great care in terms of helping us select the right dog and the training needed to turn this stubborn foster into our lovable dog.<//Review>

I have adopted three dogs from GSR Orange County. Each adoption was done professionally, and with emphasis on the dogs health and safety. The staff is professional and thorough. Great experience!</Text>

I was immediately denied when I said that I wanted utilize the dog as a service dog. I know there are Veteran organizations that provide you with a dog but I wanted to bring in my own but I guess not. One more great home that does not get to rescue a dog from here<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>GSROC is a professionally run rescue organization. It tries to find out as much information as possible about its dogs and match them up with the right adopter.  A phone interview and home visit were both part of the adoption process.   Many rescues never return calls or emails but the GSROC volunteers I worked with promptly responded to all my inquiries.  I am so thankful for the amazing dog I adopted through GSROC.< /Review>< pics>

<review>My husband and I have adopted three dogs since 2007. We have the most amazing experience with GSROC.  We were willing to wait as long as it took to find the perfect fit for our family. This past April (after submitting an app and having contact by them with our exact requirements about a year ago) they called us and told us about this one girl (Sarah on the website but now her name is Abilene) . Everything was seem less and so well organized (all three times!!).  We met her with our two toddler girls and our male 5 year old (also on the website and his name is still Austin but we call him Bubba). Everything they did was perfect. We could not be happier with Abilene and how we have been treated by our GSROC family. They really want to place these puppies on forever homes.  We will always use them!!!!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I had to fill out an application in order to get a question answered about a dog. So I completed the questionnaire, and within thirty seconds I got a rejection because I answered on one of the questions that "I didn't know where the dog would sleep'. I found that extremely bizarre and disappointing. How should one know ahead of time, without knowing a dog or its age, where it would want to sleep? In my bedroom? My daughter's ? My other daughter's? Alone? That cannot be determined ahead of time. How terrible to have deprived a dog from a happy home based on shallow generic questionnaire. One could have called and asked to clarify instead of rejection and advising me to think further and deeper about my quality of home. I rescued a GSD from the Westside Shepherd Rescue before, and after my dog died I have spent years getting ready for a new dog, and now that I finally feel ready to open up again to a new GSD, I get this poor unprofessional treatment. How sad. I had heard about poor customer service at the OC part of the rescue (which I know is unrelated to the Westside GSD rescue), and now I guess I can confirm. This is my very first review but I really feel that strongly about being vocal about that poor call.<//review>

<Text>I have rescued several of my dogs from this organization. They are very professional. They take very good care of the dogs while they are waiting for their forever homes. GSROC has a team to walk each dog daily. Bathe them regularly and transport to adoption events. They have at least 1 adoption event every weekend. So the dogs have an opportunity to meet their new family every weekend.  I was so impressed with GSROC that not only did I adopt my dogs from them. I am also now an active volunteer. And very proud to say so.<//Text><gmapID>0x80dcdff8fee40087:0xa738fa3fa37a554f< /gmapID><resp>None</resp>< rating>

Best rescue ever!  They are passionate about saving these dogs and matching them up with the right adopters ... and having these dogs go off to a happy and safe life.  If you want to know what a rescue dog is all about don't hesitate to contact these wonderful people.< /Review>

They do home inspections and check in on you to make sure the transition goes smoothly.

We applied to adopt a GSD. At the time, the rescue had over 30 available dogs. We told them that we had rescued GSDs before, did not have children or other dogs currently in the house, had a fenced-in yard with doggie door, would not leave the dog alone during the day (my wife works from home), and were financial stable and could afford any veterinarian expenses should they arise. Despite all of these things, we were denied in our application. I asked for clarification regarding the denial and did not get any replies. So I guess that's it? I guess they don't talk to you any longer if you don't meet some hidden requirement or something.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Everyone is a volunteer.  They work to help/provide for any German Shepherd Dog in need and placement as well. They do "fostering home" for the dogs.
Been involved with them for about 20+ years, donating.
I recommend them highly.
Remember, the German Shepherd puppy looks cute when small.
When they grow, they get bigger and demand more physically active attention and TRAINING/OBEDIENCE.
Need a sizeable yard for them to play etc. At least an hour a day plus at least 1 mile trot/walk.
Apt's/condo's dont cut it.
These ARE working dogs.
If you dont work them they can get frustrated and become destructive. You dont walk away and forget them.
Not every home is meant to have a GSD.
Think, before you add a GSD to your pack. Can you do this for at least 10+ years, without delay?
NEVER abandon a GSD, EVER!
Love/respect them, they will love/respect you.
Expect a follower, closer than a shadow.  You wont regret it, EVER!<//Review>< Name>

Based on the great reviews we were excited to submit our online application for a dog whose bio looked like a great match. We got an automated message saying our application was received and to expect a call in a couple of days. When five days passed with no contact I emailed asking if they needed anything further. We got an email saying we would receive a call on the weekend. It is now Tuesday and no call. I volunteer at a shelter and it's hard to understand this lack of responsiveness when so many animals need homes!  Very disappointed.< /Text>

<review>I had almost the same experience as Mary Thomson. I submitted my application and received a auto reply which mentioned some one would call me.  A week later, no response,, because I liked that dog so much, I submitted 2nd application. I Got an phone interview this time, but I was not qualified even I had two GSD before. The reason that interviewer rejected me because I only committed to walk the dog at least 5 days a week. I also have a back yard. Later the dog picture was taken off, nothing mentioned the dog was adopted or what.</review>< Pics>

<Review>I can't even describe how amazing this rescue is. They put so much effort into making sure that each dog is cared for and placed in a loving, appropriate home. Adopt don't shop for your family dog and you will still get an amazing, intelligent and beautiful animal that is hand picked for you. My parents have gotten their last three shepherds from here. My uncle adopted a fourth from them and I will be the fifth when I am ready for my own shepherd. I have volunteered for them as well and I wish the organization a long happy life so that they can continue to rescue dogs like the shelter angels that they are <3<//Review><Rating>5< /Rating><gmapID>0x80dcdff8fee40087:0xa738fa3fa37a554f< /gmapID>< Name>

<review>Beware!! This co. sold me a Belgian  Malinois (not a German Shepard that I thought I was going to adopt)that was suppose to be a puppy(7mo.)  Belgians personality are totally different....Took it to a vet two days later for check up and vet said there is NO way the dog was 7 months.  (Most likely 1yr and 7 mo.) Thanks for that. The vet also said the DOG was most likely abused by observing his actions/ demeanor .
So basically they sold me a dog that was adopted,abused then brought back to this co. I guess this happens a lot from talking with several people at the vets office. Saddness<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I have been a volunteer with this organization for a long time. They are caring, know a great deal about dogs and, of course, German Shepherds. They try their best to place dogs in forever homes and succeed most of the time. I adopted a GSD from them and have fostered many dogs. If you want a GSD, this is the place to go.< /text>

I have tried to adopt twice and both times they said NO, i guess they don't really want to find homes for these dogs.

The reason they gave was the dog had to sleep outside in my Gazebo. Wow
I thought that is were dogs slept, unless you have a small pocket dog and that could sleep anywhere.

So beware if you try and get turned down, at least you tried.

I GUESS I AM JUST CRAZY, BUT I THOUGHT THEY WERE TO FIND HOMES FOR THESE DOGS. IF THEY ARE THIS PICKY, HOW ARE THESE DOGS GOING TO FIND HOMES.<//Review>

We were looking for a puppy to raise, GSROC was really easy to work with. They work with a good size kennel and a big foster network, so there is a wide selection. We are quite happy with our quickly growing 6mo old shep.< /Text>

The GSROC are a great organization.  They truly care about the dogs and the adopters.  They want to make sure the dogs are a fit for their future owners and vice versa.  I had very specific needs in my home and all the dogs I viewed online that I wanted would not be a fit.  Steve the adoption coordinator had a couple of dogs that would fit my particular needs and I came to visit them at the rescue.  It is a great place to meet your potential furry family member.  The first few days of my adoption of Peter aka Buddy was not a very smooth transition.  I contacted Steve at GSROC with some major concerns and he put me in touch with their in house professional trainer.  They both wanted to make sure that Buddy was the right dog for my family.  It has been about a month now and I could not ask for a better dog.  He is exactly the fit I needed for my family.  I am glad that I chose GSROC and not another rescue.  If you are looking for a new furry family member and are not sure of which rescue to choose, I definitely recommend German Shepherd Rescue of Orange County.</text>

<review>GSROC is an amazing rescue organization. GSROC really care about the animals they rescue, along with German Shepherds they have cats and other breeds of dogs because they see the need and care for all breeds. My wife and I fostered first before we adopted and they made the process seamless, their team is extremely thorough because placing animals in the right homes is a critical part to the process and they make sure it's a right fit everyone. I highly recommend checking out their adoption events if you are interested in meeting the team and dogs.< /review>< time>

They never called me back. You would think they want to save dogs but if they NEVER call you back how in the world could that ever happen?<//Review>

Duke was my boy in January 2006 until January 2017 when cancer stole him.  He was a remarkable, loving, intelligent dog who was our guardian, protector, defender, and love.  GSROC was so helpful with us and ultimately matched us; We will returning early next year for our next GSD.  Thank you, GSROC, for our wonderful Duke and our wonderful years together.</text>

<Text>Of the 35 GS dogs at the shelter in San Bernardino were taken to rescues not one was adoptable. How is this fair to people searching at the shelter. GS of OC say they rescue dogs when there is no where else to turn. This is not true it has only been 2 days they just get there first or have an in. Never again!!!!</Text><rating>1< /rating>< pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Since adopting our first dog from GSROC a few years ago, we have fostered a couple of puppies and ended up adopting them, too.  The first had been dumped at a high kill shelter with a broken leg.  The shelter contacted GSROC and said if they didn't come get her, they were going to euthanize her.  Despite the fact that fixing her leg meant a big vet bill, GSROC rescued her.  Many of the dogs GSROC takes in have medical problems that are very expensive to remediate:  dogs with severe cases of mange, parvo, distemper, or other medical conditions that require thousands of dollars in treatment.  These are costs in addition to the routine ones:  spay/neuter, complete vaccinations, microchipping and deworming.

Our second pup was being given away for free on Craigslist. They try to rescue dogs in that situation because GIVING AWAY AN ANIMAL FOR FREE IS A VERY BAD IDEA.  They often end up being used as bait for dog fighting rings, are sold for experimentation, or meet other horrible fates.  Anyway, she, too, is now a member of a family that will cherish her for the rest of her life.

These people work so hard for the dogs in their care and strive to find them the best possible homes.  They carefully screen applications and do home checks.  Every dog in their care has been failed by someone at least once.  GSROC wants to make sure it doesn't happen to them again.  The dogs deserve that!</review><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcdff8fee40087:0xa738fa3fa37a554f<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>We’ve been calling over and over to adopt but no one seems to call us back or email us.
Our sweet darling dog passed away a month ago and we are ready to have another one join our family
We may have to go to a breeder to purchase one. So sorry but we had a wonderful loving home for a rescue

Terrible service. This place is run by professional crooks. They will not refund our money or replace a broken, defective couch still under warranty. The employees will not allow you to speak to manager and make excuses that he is unavailable or doesn't answer/return phone calls.</review>

<text>Bought a couch set on 10 Jan 21.  They wouldn't sell the floor model to us and we were told 3 weeks fo delivery.  We came back around Valentine's Day to inquire; floor model gone and fluff story about covid and a promise of Mar 1.  We came back on 8 Mar; same response.  Came back on Easter Sunday to get money back.  I was told that the boss will call us on Monday.  We'll see.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<rate>1< /rate><review>First and foremost if I could give this place no stars I would, I placed an order back in August and haven't received it yet,  yes I'm completely understanding about the wait due to pandemic. However, not once have I received a call regarding a follow up and reassuring that it's still delayed! I on the other hand, have called multiple times and left voicemail and haven't been called back. I finally got the opportunity to walk in to the store this past week and asked about my order they said I wouldn't be receiving till December! Hence, my order was a present and I didn't expect to it to be delayed as it has. Furthermore, I was told I would receive a call to follow-up. STILL WAITING. All reviews say great customer service but that isn't the case for me. Do yourself the favor and make business elsewhere.<//review>< user_id>

I had placed an order for August 2019 and they assured me that my delivery would get to my apartment before September.  I told them it was important for them to get it to me by the end of August because I was moving to San Diego. But they assured me that if it didn't arrive on time they would deliver it to San Diego. Its 2021 now and I can't get ahold of anyone. They haven't followed up or anything. Do yourself a favor and don't buy from here because they clearly don't care for their customer.< /text>

Great Customer Service.  Prices are great.  I shopped around for a very unique elegant and expensive dinning table and they had the best price in the Valley and Yuma area. Delivery was on time for Valentines Day just like promised. Thank you Mike. 😊</review>

<text>Probably the worse customer service we have experienced. We purchased a couch from this store two weeks ago and asked for a specific corner chaise since our living room is smaller. The couch arrived and it was the wrong side corner chaise, we called the store right away and we are told that the sales representative is new and didn’t realize that the one we wanted is no longer in stock. We checked Ashley’s Furniture stock since Primos furniture operates under Ashley’s furniture and confirmed that the item is still available.

We then called Primos the very next day and dealt with the most unprofessional rude sales associate over the phone. He didn’t even want to take any of our information since he says he needs to speak with the sales associate that helped us. We are told we were going to get a call back but still have not.

We also were charged delivery although free delivery was part of their pitch. I have never dealt with this kind of horrible customer service. I would highly suggest going ANYWHERE ELSE.

Reply to the stores response:
that is correct and what we have been trying to explain to two different sales representative on the phone is that we did not get what we ordered in the picture. We got the opposite chase, the first representative then gives us the excuse that the one we wanted ( the one I showed you in the picture) is no longer in stock and can’t be ordered anymore even though we can clearly go to Ashleys furniture to order the item and the second representative didn’t even bother asking for a resolution. We never got a call back in the three different times that we tried to call and resolve this concern. We attempted to call again yesterday and today and can’t even get to a sales associate. This sale occurred less than two weeks ago and we can’t even get a call back to resolve this, this store is extremely unprofessional.  If we can’t get professional customer service over the phone, what confidence do we have in good customer service in person?<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Name>Ceezg Hernandez<//Name><Time>1565724213149< /Time><rating>5</rating><review>Had a great experience in the store, once I started calling about where my delivery was, the owners son answered and pretty much told me to call later or not at all because he didn't deal with any of it and the staff was busy. I gave them a chance and called back 20 minutes later, I got no answer twice. They called me back to tell me they would follow up and call me back in 10 minutes, an hour later still no call. I called a 3rd time to get the same, let me call you back in 15 minutes. I then got a call from their warehouse telling me the delivery would not be until the following day. Lost a whole day of work waiting on this delivery.

Follow up.

I had returned to cancel my order but was able to talk with the owner Mike. He listened to my complaints and was extremely gracious in explaining the situation with my purchase. Everything was calmly talked out and we gladly continued with our purchse. Big thank you to Mike.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Mike the salesman was able to close our order becauSe he verbally have his word product would be here by certain date. No call about delivery ...when called to
Follow up the girl never called back after checking on our order which led to us going in to follow up the next day. Which Mike made comments how the truck came the day before and he lied about the truck going for our product. We shall see how long it takes to get our order because he would not have been able to close the deal if we would have known product wouldn't be delivered in time and purchased the item somewhere else.

If i could give this business no stars i would. its been over a month i ordered a dining table set from this no good furniture store. when i finally got my table delivered it was the wrong table i was told id get the correct table in 2 weeks. 2 weeks came and went never received it i call, email and leave messages with Mike the manager and all he does is say "i dont know where your table is" i really regret taking my business to this place. The employees are rude they yell at you and they lie.<//Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>I can attest to the bad review left by my wife earlier today. Just from the response written in a reply to wife from this store just shows how incompetent they are. The first time we went to the store to just look and not buy we already knew and discussed what side we wanted the chaise on our couch to be. We even discussed with the sales associates at the store. The next week my wife went into the store and ordered the couch exactly the way we wanted it. We received the couch a week and a half later, earlier than we were told which is not a bad thing , but we both work and I was told that the earlier time was the only time that they could drop it off. Luckily I was off of work in time that day to receive the couch. While they were setting it up I noticed that the couch had the chaise on the wrong side. I double checked with my wife through text and she verified that it was wrong. I then told the movers who then called their manager and instead of taking the couch back, their manager said to leave the couch there and to call the store to get the situation handled. I then called the store twice to which nobody answered the phone and their voicemail isn’t even set up to be able to leave a message. I waited about 30 minutes and called again and finally someone answered. I told them the situation and they told me that the sales associate who ordered the couch for my wife couldn’t order the one we wanted because it was out of stock so she (the sales associate) got the one that had the chaise on the opposite side we wanted without telling us. I was confused by this but she said to talk to the sales associate the next day to get a different couch switched out. The phone call ended without an apology or even an offer to have the sales associate gives us a call the next day to fix the situation. The next morning my wife called about the couch again where she had a conversation with a different sales associate who rudely told her that he didn’t sell her the couch so she’ll have to wait and call back when the sales associate who sold her the couch gets into work. Frustrated by this horrible customer service, my wife and I decided not to call back and wait and see if we would even get a courtesy call from this store. No avail. A few days later which brings us to today where my wife again tried calling 3 times yet received no answer and no chance to leave a voicemail due their “broken or full” voicemail. Yet the store was able to reply to my wife here on the review page only to tell her that she was wrong and to come into the store. Again, no apology, no offer to call, no offer to kindly help resolve the situation. This is very unfortunate and we regret buying from this store. Don’t get me wrong the couch is great, but we could’ve got the right couch from their other competitors but we decided to support the local business. Unfortunately in this case it was a grave mistake. Sometimes i guess it is just worth it to pay a little extra to be able to be treated with a little respect. The fact that they can’t admit to their mistake or even think that they possibly made a mistake is truly sad. It’s to the point now where my wife and I don’t even want to deal with them to switch out the couch, because of how poorly this situation has been handled and how poorly they have treated paying customers. Plus we can’t even get in contact with them without going to the store but there’s honestly no reason to go into the store without a resolution from them. And on top of all of this we were also charged a $60 delivery fee in which we were told that our delivery would be free. This was honestly one of the worst transactions that we have ever had.< /Review>< userid>

<Date>1533590300046</Date><user_name>Alyssa Delada< /user_name><Review>Ordered a vanity mirror during their July 4th sale, they told me 2-3 weeks it would be delivered and to wait for the call. Never received a call over a month so I call today and simply ask for an update on my order and Mike answered and told me to call back with a order number, when I said I didnt have it anymore because we recently moved and things were chaotic he laughed and rudely told me "I dont know why you people never have the order number." After he said he'll look it up through my last name he said okay I'm going now theres a customer and hung up. I've been here about twice and the young lady and young man who work the floor are always sweet and nice. The young man actually remembered us from the first time we came and gave us free delivery for my vanity mirror. These 2 stars are for them, thank you for your professionalism. I hope Mike actually calls me back with an update on when I will receive my mirror and receives an in service on customer service 101. I didnt except him to go out of his way to accommodate me, and dont blame them because it could be the delivery companies fault, but this encounter makes me not want to buy from them again.< /Review><user_id>104236605361125757540<//user_id><Resp>{'time': 1533683315864, 'text': 'Hello Alyssa this is the "young man" my name is Subah.

(Translated by Google) NOOOO RECOMMENDEDOOO !!! Zero stars for this place ... I bought a dining room the first of March, they told me that in 8 weeks they would deliver it to me ... 8 weeks passed and only the table was ready ... (in all that time I did not receive any calls from of them) the chairs would be ready by the end of June ... they are liars in terms of delivery dates, the poorly dressed and poorly presented girl they have at the reception is inept and has bad treatment with customers ... I asked for my refund for lack of word for the delivery of my dining room ... the girl instead of giving me my refund because I paid with a debit card RECEIVED me again she was wrong so I say she is an inept one and now I had to wait 5 days to to make me valid my TWO refunds .. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THAT PLACE !!! NO STARS FOR THAT PLACE ..

NOOOO RECOMENDADOOOO!!! Cero estrellas para este lugar..yo compré un comedor los primeros de Marzo, me dijeron que en 8 semanas me lo entregarían..pasaron las 8 semanas y solo estaba lista la mesa..(en todo ese tiempo no recibí ninguna llamada por parte de ellos) las sillas estarían listas para los últimos de Junio.. son unos mentirosos en cuanto a las fechas de entrega, la muchacha mal vestida y mal presentada que tienen en recepción es una inepta y tiene malos tratos con los clientes..pedí mi reembolso por falta de palabra por la entrega de mi comedor..la muchacha en lugar de hacerme mi reembolso por que pagué con tarjeta de débito me VOLVIÓ A COBRAR se equivocó por eso digo que es una inepta y ahora yo tuve que esperar 5 días para que me hicieran válidos mis DOS reembolsos..JAMAS RECOMENDARIA ESE LUGAR!!!NINGUNA ESTRELLA PARA ESE LUGAR..<//review>

I love this store! So friendly and inventory is excellent. I've bought tons of clothing, hats, and accessories here, the quality is always tip notch and the staff are very knowledgeable and friendly. You also can rack up bonus points on each transaction that can be used online.< /Review>

I stopped in this store to exchange a skateboard that I had purchased at the Redding store. Redding store sold me this board even though it looked as though it may have been used before. The deck looked a little scuffed but I did not mind until I realized one of the bearings were defective. I called the Chico store manager (Xavier) and explained the situation in great detail and he said to bring it in for an exchange.

I drove from Stirling City to Zumiez in Chico only to have Xavier try to tell me the board had been used and he could not do the exchange. I explained to him that the Redding store manager sold me this board exactly as it is. He had a hard time believing that the Redding store Manager would sell a board in this condition and made it very clear by sub-texting and condescending tones that he did not believe me. After once again explaining to him what I already discussed over the phone, he decided to do the exchange.

This is where he became rude and unfriendly, ESPECIALLY being the fact that he's the leader of this store. While my daughter was choosing another board I couldn't stop overhearing him continue to subtext to employees about the condition of the board and how he just could not believe Redding store manager would sell me a board in this condition. I grew irritated and confronted Xavier by saying, "I feel disrespected because I'm being called a liar". That statement must have offended him because he threatened to have me exchange it at another Zumiez store. This would have required me to drive at least another hour to another Zumiez store. I explained to him that he's the one being offensive with his subtle accusations and sub-texting.

During the exchange he realized that I was telling the truth when he saw the employee's name on my receipt and the 10% "markdown" the GM from Redding store applied. Before this he was ADAMANT on how no one from the Redding store, especially the GM Javier (who held a higher position than him), would never sell me a board in this condition. At this point he literally appeared dazed and confused. I finally asked if the exchange was complete so I could leave the store. He said yes and he still seemed to be in awe over the situation. On my way out I made it clear to him (for the 10th time) that I'm an honest person with integrity.

After all that this Store Manager Xavier didn't even offer me an apology. I will never come back to any Zumiez store. This Xavier fellow is a very rude, condescending, and frail man.< /review>

< Review>
Terrible experience. While shopping, employees were on their cell phone. I usually do not shop at Zummies, thus, I browsed the store and walked around. I found a shirt that I was interested in but decided to leave it. On my way out, employee asked were I had put the shirt. I did not remember, then employee asked for me to open my purse. At this point I knew I was being accused of stealing. Knowing I had done nothing wrong I did so as well as my sister. We came out clean. Employee was very rude and continued being rude even after coming out clean and did not care one bit. I will NOT be returning. Unacceptable!<//Review>

I hate this shoe store. Not only is everything over priced, but the customer service is terrible. The employees are rude and aren't really looking out for your best interest. If you're looking for cute name brand shoes, go to vans or Heel and Sole. Don't waste your time here. I don't recomend.<//Text>

Usually have no complaints or any worth noting when I go to this store,this time was not one of those.  Very un professional disorganized and un able to take hold of the number one goal one learns in the industry, CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT.  What's even worse is this was an instance where the customer was actually and obviously right and still wasn't treated with  care or efficiency.</Text>

It's a convenient place to stop for a few items at a good price. They are understaffed. So if there are more than a couple of people in line for checkout....you're going to have a bit of a wait.< /text>

<Review>It's pretty decent. What I like most is the friendly, helpful staff & most of their stuff is priced pretty fair- clothes mainly. And I've bought several clothing items from this place so I'd know lol their garments last WAY longer than similar items I've bought at Walmart. Yeah, I'm a budget shopper, how could u tell lol

Oh and another strong point I feel merits mentioning in its own paragraph: the great hours! Being open until 11pm in this remote location is so amazing bcuz many times I've needed something like cough meds for the kids or ginger ale, soup, ice etc. in a pinch and it's either too late for a drive in town or just don't feel the drive. I love it.

The one drawback is EVERY time I buy the Cat Temptations cat treats that are labeled & advertised for $3/bag, they ring up at $3.15 PLUS tax! I've brought this to their attention, but apparently not to the right person bcuz still, it continues to occur. I know it's only .15¢ but it all adds up afterwhile bcuz I buy A LOT of cat treats 😸</Review>< Rate>

Ok to be fair, this is of course a fast food restaurant. However, in all the fast food restaurants, this one is really our favorite!

Often we are so tired from work and just looking to have a quick dinner. Noodles & Company is always reliable, and with the free delivery from DoorDash it’s just the place for that last minute delicious lifesaver.

For those who’ve never been there, Noodles & Company has a very simple menu. Few noodle choices served with different sauces like pesto, Alfredo, marinara... But the thing that appealing is that all their menu items can be made vegetarian! All of them!

I would highly recommend you’re try the Pesto Caviapatti. And the spaghetti Alfredo is one my favorites. Also FYI: their Mac-and-cheese side and tomato bisque soups are fantastic! Totally worth the extra $3.</text>

Enjoyed the Thai noodles and the green salad as well. Reasonably priced, especially when it's so big I can make a second meal out of it! Generous with the noodles and staff was friendly.</Text>

2nd time ever going to one of these restaurants and both times I've had some delicious stuff. This time I had the zucchini pesto noodles with chicken and it didn't disappoint! The cashier (don't remember the name sorry) was super friendly and patient with my indecisiveness while ordering. Will be back for more!< /text>

<Text>I'm so happy every time I go here. I saw some people saying that they aren't fast enough serving people it's because real food actually takes time to prepare and make. Also the Apple macaroons cake is so good! It's perfect. Not to sweet! The food is so fresh and tasty! Give it a try! :)<//Text>< Pictures>

The Mac & Cheese was very bad. It was like they took Cheddar slices and put it on hot pasta. I could make this dish in 15 minutes. Not creamy or baked, worst than boxed. Very disappointing...<//text>

<text>One of my favorite Noodles and Company place in the bay. Went here twice and both times it was great. The spicy beef noodle soup is SCRUMPTIOUS. And get the peach sparkling drink. It's also DELICIOUS. The beef is super tender.

< Review>
A little on the pricey side excellent food and small portions. Found myself spending about $16 per person in my party. Noodles are cheap, increase the portions and make me feel I'm getting what I paid for. The food is good though, love the primavera pasta with chicken. The garlic toast is awesome. Service was impeccable, all present were kind, courteous and helpful. Overall experience was a four because I felt I did not get a portion equal to the cost. With Olive garden nearby and limitless pasta bowls available they should rethink portions and offer a larger serving size</Review>

<text>I love this place, only I was disappointed in the flavors this time. We ordered the peanut sauce noodles w/chicken. The peanut butter sauce was just too much, too thick and rich for me. Great flavor though and good serving of chicken.  Also ordered the korean beef noodles. The flavor was too sweet and tangy for me. The potstickers I didn't realize we only got 5 of our 6 piece serving, but that's ok because the didn't taste very fresh, just ok. The dipping sauce was great. The side of mac was delish.< /text><Name>G Z<//Name>< user>

Eli (i hope that's how his name is spelled)was very helpful, very welcoming, and very nice.
He made the experience enjoyable!  (He should get employee of the month!)
Food tasted great and was very well portioned (big plate filled with noodles!).
Noodles and Company is my fave when visiting California.  I wish we had one in Tucson, AZ.  But it makes the trip to Cali exciting to know this restaurant is there.< /Text>

The Japanese pan noodles are a great meal and low on the caloric intake compared to many of their other dishes, which is surprising since the dish was tasty and well worth trying on our first visit. The restaurant decor and cleanliness was kinda blah but the noodles made up for it.<//review>

We love Noodles & Co.. Ordering was a bit off at this location (simple order items seemed to confuse the staff... maybe they were training someone... we've all been the newbie once). We actually hit this location twice in as many days (stocking up since we don't live near a Noodles) and it was consistently good. They also have w Freestyle Coke machine (which is awesome, btw). Heads up: the BBQ Mac was much better than the Buffalo Mac (for which I had very high hopes). It seems like they prepare the Mac differently for the Buffalo (less creamy) and that, combined maybe with the parmesan the add, really made the Buffalo Mac seem dry or mealy. I totally ate it; just saying.<//Text>

Today your services were bellow standard. My takeout order was cold by the time I got home, contrary to the many services I've received in the last FEW years. The food sat open and exposed on the shelf too long before it was properly packaged.

Reason: Inexperienced and ineffective help you've hired. This may be cost effective to you it's detrimental to my satisfaction.

Thus, today I'll give the lowest rating possible: 1.< /Text>

My fiance and I love this place. Good food and a fair price and staff is always nice and friendly.  The food comes out fast and is always good. They also have the cool coke machines that have all the flavors, which I really like.  Always clean and they clean the tables after you leave. Love this place and it is usually not to crowded which is nice.<//review>

<Text>I truly enjoyed my meal here. They had such a great variety (of noodles) to choose from. I'm trying to watch my calorie intake and there wasn't too much I couldn't have from the menu. The small size with a protein is just enough and then I added a side. All for about $10.</Text><user_name>Donna Rehome<//user_name><pics>None</pics>< Time>

Friendly and helpful staff. Very clean. The lemon wedges to squeeze into iced tea are cut perfectly. The ice dispenser is one of those hateful ones built in to the misbegotten multiselection drink machine. Thai curry noodles are tasty but not as spicy as I'd like. I plan to return soon, even though it is far out of my way, to try the macaroni and cheese dishes.< /text>

<Text>I've seen the slice a few times now and wanted to give it a try. We had planned on going to another restaurant in this area but it was very crowded so we headed over to Noodles & Company. I was a little skeptical when I saw the menu had a bit of a schizophrenic feel with so many varieties from Asian to American to Italian. So glad we stuck around and gave it a shot. We tried an appetizer of the Korean meatballs the Mediterranean salad and the Korean beef noodles. Everything was excellent! Fresh taste and good service. Very glad we found this spot because we will definitely be back.< /Text>< Time>

Our first time at this location was perfectly okay for what the place is. In my humble opinion the stores in and around the Denver area run a slightly tighter ship than this location but there was nothing terrible about it, it was just nothing extra fantastic.</review>

<review>One of their new beef noodle dishes actually sent me to the ER. Thankfully my wife was home and able to get me in the car and to the hospital... mind you, this was a single experience and not necessarily a shining example or what everyone's experience might be. I should also say that I had been here a few other times to sort of "test the flavors" before hand. Each of those experiences however was also pretty lack-luster to say the least. Come to think of it, I've never once left this place feeling satisfied, so after this last visit, I think it's safe to say that noodles & company is officially off the list of dinner options from here on out.< /review></record>

Had interactions with two different employees here, both had a very negative attitude. When our food was served we felt the portions were very small. No other Noodles location served us like this. Ordered a regular size steak stroganoff and got half a plate of cooked noodles (very watery, apparently they don’t know how to strain noodles here) with what seemed like a sad attempt at some peices of dry steak (no sauce) and a dash of cheese on top. Also literally had one piece of mushroom. One (this is not a joke). Going to the Raising Canes across the street after this. Don’t come here.< /Review>

<Text>Not impressed by much here,  except the fact they zucchini noodles instead of wheat.
Everything here was so Basic, it should be called noodles for people who wouldn't normally order any,  definitely not a place for noodle love< /Text>< pictures>

Noodles were very overcooked and had been sitting for a while.
Ordered the Asian dish with steak and it was very dry.< /Text>

This popular Midwestern noodle chain serves up a diverse and inexpensive lunch/dinner. However, I'm not sure how well this concept will translate to California where you can get authentic pad thai, Italinan food and other dishes very nearby.< /review>

Always a pleasure coming here. The people that work here are great !! Very friendly to everybody that visits. The food is Uhhhh Mazzzzing !! They have a great menu with choices from all over. Fresh ingredients and sauces with a great flavor. The dining room is kept clean and they can have some people come through here. If there's a line they get you through pretty good and if you have the app you can order ahead on line. Try a little smolder from Boulder seasoning if you like some spice but be careful...it will sneak up on you. We love having more Noodles & Company out here and hope you enjoy it as much as we do. Bon Appetit !!!!</Text>

<text>We first went the the Vancouver, WA location and we were thothoroughly impressed. Then this one opened up in our area. We have been probably 4 or 5 times and i just kept hoping it was "a bad batch" but no this location cant make decent pasta. I dont plan on ever going back. The butter noodles are LITTERALLY swiming in butter. There is almost more butter then noodle gross. And the mac n cheese was DISGUSTING. Mac n cheese is one of my 4 year olds FAVORITE and even she wouldnt eat it. Her mac n cheese litterally was a pile if noodles also swimming in greese with a TINY bit of cheese sprinkled on top. Flavor and quality aside  why anyone would pay that much money for 15 noodles is beyond me.

We ordered the butter noodles and mac n cheese at thr Vancouver location. The bowl of butter noodles was huge. Less greesy and more flavor. The mac n cheese was thick with cheese sauce.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Brand new and exceptionally clean. So many options. Parking attendants are super nice. Meat section is fantastic. So many options and cuts you wouldn't find at regular grocer.< /review>

Small market can hardly move but meat is good. If you buy $30 or more you get a free item. In addition, it stacks so if you buy $90 you get 3 free items.< /text>

My 3 lb, 141/2 year old papillon was a regular patient at PBVet and today was hit by my neighbor’s car in our driveway. I rushed to the vet, 1mile away and they refused to see her.  I begged and pleaded but they said I needed to take her to an ER. I asked if they could just evaluate her since she was a patient and the girl said the vet was at lunch. I said can’t you call her since you know her and she said no. I will never bring a dog to them again and highly discourage anyone from using them ever again.</text>

COVID MITIGATION REVIEW

PB Vet has been my veterinary clinic for 4 years now and they are so friendly and helpful. They treat your animals like an extension of their own family and its clear how passionate they are for their work.
I only give 4 stars because of how absolutely long it takes for them to see your pet. As with many vets, they have started coming outside to retrieve your pet from you. I have waited outside with my dogs for upwards of 45 minutes past my scheduled appointment, and that's on average. From my car I could see several other people pacing in place, waiting for someone to come out and take their dogs in. Hopefully they get comfortable with this new system soon enough.< /text>

Very pleased how my 13 month old was taken care of after tearing his dew claw.
I will continue to use PB vet. This was the first issue for my little guy.</review>

If you care about your pet, please do not take them here. Our puppy is now experiencing major complications because of the care it received at this clinic.  Pumping antibiotics, not listening and horrible service.</Review>

Jackie is the office manager at Pacific Beach Veterinary Clinic. She is amazing. Very efficient. I have pet insurance and need my visits to be submitted to my insurance company and she goes out of her way to make sure everything is submitted and one step further, emails me to confirm. Very happy with her customer service.<//text>

I have been taking my parrots to Dr. Benita Keiss for over 15 years. She is the best avian veterinarian in my long experience with birds since I was a child.  She has been caring for my birds for these many years and I trust her opinions completely.< /Text>

We were camping and needed a vet for our dog. They immediately took her. Dr. Braunstein attended to her and also spoke with our Vet  back home. I would recommend them in a heartbeat!</review>

<Text>I cant brag enough about this office. They were part of the process that helped save our dog when he was a puppy from parvo. They genuinely care about every pet that goes there. They have also listened to me rant and helped me tremendously with an overseas quartine to Japan. The overseas process is not easy and each time iv bugged them about needing paperwork sent or needing it signed a certain way they've done it asap. If we ever return to San Diego this will be our clinic again for sure.</Text>< Rating>

Dr Keiss had been my "family" doctor for many years for my large menagerie of parrots, dogs, and cats. I was the only one at my house who wasn't her patient. She has done some amazing things with some of the gang - especially parrots requiring surgery resulting from injuries. One of the hardest things about moving from San Diego was leaving Dr Keiss. The other vets have also been helpful and compassionate. The staff is also great. I always felt like part of the family.<//review>

I've been with Dr. Keiss for over 20 years with two different dogs and I'm Grateful for her and the entire staff. I think specifically it has been a real pleasure to see how the staff has grown and matured. It is a testament to the philosophy and leadership of the organization. I say "Thank You" for your excellent care!</Review>

Dr. Kies has taken excellent care of our dogs since we moved here 11 years ago. I am very grateful to have found such a skilled and caring veterinarian. Our pets are family and and PB Vet understands that. Our dog loves to go there and literally pulls us in the door. He knows he will be treated gently and kindly by everyone there. I know he will receive excellent care.<//Text>

Very Clean Facility... Fill in Vet yesterday Dr. Hallan ? was great!

I have tried several Vets over the years, but by and far, the most dependable and effective Care always comes from  PB Vet Clinic.

The most important thing for me is that I am getting the best care for my Great Dane... that is why I go to PB VET Clinic</review>< Pictures>

Very friendly staff. I've taken my cat in twice and so far so good. Prices seem reasonable and the Doctors and staff seem knowledgeable. They support other pet organizations in the community so I donated some kitty food to them for the holidays. I'd recommend giving them a try.< /review>

They always find time to fit us in. Always. And I have confidence in the quality of care as well. They will make referrals if they feel your dog needs a specialist--they are honest about their abilities and I appreciate that. Everyone on their team (from the front desk to the doctors) is a pleasure to work with.<//Review>

I have been taking my dog Bella Bear to see Dr. Keiss since she was 2 years old. Ten years later, I brought my new puppy Helix knowing we are starting a long relationship of excellent care and true compassion. I would never go anywhere else. The entire staff- clerks, techs, docs and all- are so knowledgeable and loving towards our fur babies. I would highly recommend coming here.< /Review>

You are unlikely to find a more accommodating group of people in your life.  The staff goes way above and beyond to take care of our pets.  Olivia in the front office processed a refund for a very costly RX pet food for me over the phone.  She took me on my word that the bag would be returned by our son after Thanksgiving.  We live in Arizona and it would have been a huge inconvenience for us to return it ourselves.  Olivia never skipped a beat.  She asked me for my credit card information and handled it quickly.  PBVC is my first choice when we visit our son in Pacific Beach.<//Text>

I've been to several vet clinics in the area and this is where I choose to take my dog and where I recommended my daughter take her new rescue dog.  I've not worked with a particular vet in the office, but all of them have been friendly, and answered all my questions.  The overall experience was superior.

By the way if you get a rescue dog and they give you a list of vets that will check them free, its a scam.  The free part covers nothing, and you end up with a bill.  You may as well go to the vet that you want to establish a relationship with from the start.<//text>

This is the best Vet in PB and La Jolla.   I have been seeing Dr. Keiss for over 30 years and she and her staff have ALWAYS given my animals the best care in a very caring and compassionate  way.   They treat you like family when you arrive for an appointment or you call in for assistance. They get to know and love your animals as much as you do.<//Text>

I really like my vet Dr. Chris tho at times I get other vets who either barely look at my kitty or others that care but seem to give up too soon. A vet place is good for you if you have a vet you think does well by your pet like picking a doctor is the health organisation you pick. Four cuz my kitty is better but not 100%</review>

<Text>They refused to take my voucher for a free exam, post shelter adoption, even though I called beforehand and they said they would take it, AND they are listed on the voucher's website as being a participant. They also tried to coerce me into doing a $200+ x-ray and buying vitamins and flea medication through their office. The antibiotics were pricey, and they also tried to sell me a second round of antibiotics for no reason. Total visit came out to almost $300 for a feline upper respiratory infection. This is a terrible office that is only in it for the money. Albeit, they treated my cat well and made him better, but I myself had a terrible experience and will never return.</Text>< user_name>

<Review>I've been a client for over 15 years and have found the staff and technicians friendly, excellent, caring and responsive.  Dr. Benita Kiess has been our primary doctor for both of our poodles, and she  is  both thoroughly caring and knowledgeable about them, their behaviors and medical history.  My wife and I have found the cost of the services reasonable and  thoroughly worthwhile for maintaining the health of our pets. Dr. Kiess's advice and care has saved us money in the long run. Thank you.< /Review></record>

I have been going to Dr. Bonita Keiss, DVM for almost 30 years, I have found are always to be professional, skilled, caring, and extremely knowledgeable. I credit her with the saving of the life of one of my hounds (Ruby), as well as keeping them all in good health and with a great quality of life. I have had 6 Basset hounds over the past 30 years, and Dr. Keiss has been my/their Vet for almost all of that time, because as far as I’m concerned I can trust her with my dog’s life and to put my dogs well-being 1st.</Text>

They didn’t tell me about my puppy’s second parasite because they didn’t check the test results well. I only was Told about the second parasite after I called them concerned my dog wasn’t feeling better. And then they checked the results again and realized he had another parasite. And this is after a 650$ visit.</text>

<review>I have used PB Vet for the last 15 years for two cats and one dog.  The staff is great, Dr. Keese is knowledgable  and caring.  They were very kind when I had to put down my older dog and cat due to cancers. Still taking my younger cat there and she is happy with them!

<Review>These folks are the best, always on top of my pet's needs and even better, sending me all appropriate notifications so I'm better able to stay on top of them, too. While my pup's needs have been prerry standard to date, I wouldn't hesitate a second taking her there in any event, confident she would be provided the best possible care.</Review>< gmapID>

<text>Dr. Keiss and Raul (and the front desk lady who's name escapes me) were so wonderful, personable and thorough with my 4 year old cat. I just moved from out of state a month ago, and they had already looked through her medical records I had faxed down, and knew what was what. They recommended a new flea medicine and gave me a sample dose, that has been working amazingly well and isn't as smelly/sticky as Advantage. I'm so relieved to be set up with Dr. Keiss, I know if anything happens before my cat's next well visit, she'll be in great hands!</text>< pictures>

I've never had anything but good experiences. Dr. Keiss is the best vet I could ever imagine. The staff is wonderful and will help you with anything. I have taken my pet there for 12 years and wouldn't go anywhere else. Ever.  Dr. Keiss is so knowledgeable and extremely caring. I am so grateful for the care my pet has gotten there through all the years.<//Text>

< Review>
At first we really loved the vet. Dr Hollihan was very helpful to us. However that love we had with the veterinarian office quickly changed. My 7 month old puppy ended up swallowing a Palm tree seed (without even knowing that he did). They did emergency surgery after figuring out what he had done. What transpired after surgery was just a mess. Finding out when we got there, that the surgery that should go perfect with no issues was not that way. One he aspirated. Two - Ended up having to take my puppy that was still UNDER anesthesia to a hospital for care. Then they wanted us to bring him back to them the next morning for the care. Ohhhh and we had care credit that we were using and then we were to pay the remaining afterwards because of the situation but instead they charged (without our approval) the whole thing to care credit. Luckily for VCA in Kearny, they saved my puppy. He had to stay additional days with very close eye on him. Having to have a feeding tube, oxygen for a day or two.

I will never ever step a foot in this place again. You almost made me lose my puppy and in debt 7,000 & time out of work.

PEOPLE STAY AWAY!< /Review>

I have been going to the Pacific Beach Veterinary Clinic for years and they are the absolute best with a very caring staff. Doctor Hoolihan has been taking care of my two Bengal cats for years. When one of them got very ill last year Doctor Hoolihan was there for me and my kitty every step of the way and made himself available to answer all my questions whether in person, by phone or by email. I would not go anywhere else.<//text>

Dr. Keiss to the rescue again for my dog.  My dog had a unknown reaction to something, that left her extremely lethargic and unstable.  Dr. Keiss figured it out, and worked us into her schedule in short notice.  Thanks.  Tom.</text>

Medically, Dr. Keiss has been through a lot with me and my dogs, including lymphoma, allergies, emergency eating things, and just general sickness.  Each and every time I am impressed by her knowledge, common sense and thoroughness.  She is also kind, caring and easy to talk to.  We could not be in better hands.

I also have to mention the vet techs and front desk staff, who are always warm and welcoming, attentive and on top of everything.  Not that I ever enjoy the vet's office, but I look forward to seeing this group.<//review></record>

I have been going to PB Vet for approximately 20 years. Dr. Keiss is my "primary" and as long as she is practicing, she will be my vet. Dr. K. has always gone out of her way to put in mountains of extra time to look into alternatives or answers or solutions to tough questions or situations. Her expertise coupled with her humanity have been a salvation to me countless times. PB Vet also helped me -- out of an emergency fund they administered at one point -- when I was jobless and bringing in stray cats from my neighborhood who needed spaying or neutering; and then again when I rescued a very sick diabetic dog. I will be forever grateful for that. I highly recommend this practice. with a special bias ( I admit) toward Dr. Keiss.< /Text>

We love Dr. Hoolihan. My schnauzer was on death's door right before Christmas. Dr. Hoolihan and his staff took him in and treated him for 3 days. They called to check on him and were just so good all the way around. Dr. Hoolihan is very transparent on what procedures and the reason for each one. He doesn't rush you or brush you off. That means alot!

Everyone there including the staff...just amazing. I never have to wait long and parking is available in front or behind the building. Even better, they have a groomer on premise named Donna. She is a doll!!!< /review>

While the staff was friendly, I would never bring my beloved pets here again. Our dog was in a fight with a much bigger dog and suffered serious bites/punctures. Our dog's wounds were stitched, which we found out later, should never be done with dog bites. His stitched wounds became abscessed and we took him to the Banfield Hospital. There they had to put him under general anesthesia, remove the stitches, clean out the wounds, and put in drain tubes. It is heartbreaking to see him in this state and outrageous that we spent over $700 only to have him in worse condition than when he got there.</Text>

<text>I have been coming to PB Vet Clinic since my first kitten in 1989. The staff and Doc's were great then and they are great now.  I have since moved to LJ, have more pets, yet continue to use PB Vet Clinic.  I have tried several others clinics, but never have they taken the place of this clinic.  I know I can always call to get information, meds or appointments on a timely, professional basis.

Dr. Keiss has been our vet for many years. She is thoughtful, thorough and responsive. We recently brought in my mother’s cat who had been evacuated from the Santa Rosa fires with my mother and without her hyperthyroid meds. Dr. Keiss gave Breezy a thorough exam and prescribed proper meds to get her back on schedule. I am grateful for Dr. Keiss quick help under unusual circumstances.< /Review>

I have been taking my dogs to PB Veterinary clinic for many years.  My vets, Dr. Benita Keiss and Dr. Hoolihan have been warm, knowledgeable and understanding of my concerns whether they be costs, discomfort for my animals or my pushing them for more information.  My lab has a serious intestinal issue and Dr. Hoolihan researched extensively over several days on the best diet that could be tolerated by my dog and was not one that was easily found and would have been overlooked without the time and research that it took.  They all are very sincere in their affection for the animals.  I have always found them to be understanding and providing the best care for both the animals as well as the owners.  They understand the stress and costs involved and are always active in creating the best treatment plans possible for both pet and owner. This sincere compassion and help was shown to me when my other dog died overnight.  The techs opened the clinic early, well before normal hours and met me outside to help me with the overwhelmingly sad process of taking him in and helping with the subsequent process.< /Review>

<text>Our dog Pinta is a patient of PB veterinary clinic since she was diagnosed with Lymphoma. She is undergoing a chemotherapy protocol, and thanks to the experienced medical knowledge and the loving care of Dr Hoolihan, Dr Keiss and all the great staff, she is in 100% remission and she's doing great, happy and active as she was before. I can't thank them enough, and every time we are at the door, regardless the treatment she has to receive there, Pinta is all happy and tail wagging to see her friends at the PB vet clinic!< /text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1506702776945, 'text': "Pinta's health and happiness means everything to us!

<review>My wife and I have been bringing our cats to the Pacific Beach Vet Clinic for over 30 years. Dr. Corrigan, then Dr. Keiss. We have always been impressed with all the staff, their professional care and compassion. Over the years we've had 11 cats that have been treated by Dr. Keiss. She is an amazing doctor who has provided excellent medical care to all our cats.< /review>< Resp>

I started using PBVC shortly after rescuing my little Lily approximately 9 months ago.  Each time I've been there at my appointment by a courtesy reminder for vaccinations, etc., the care and friendliness by the staff as well as Dr. Houlihan has been commendable.  I also appreciate the excellent grooming given Lili by Donna at this clinic<//Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Text>I have taken my dog, Diesel, to PB Vet & Dr Keiss since he was only a pup - that was almost 10 years ago!  Unfortunately Diesel has had a LOT of health issues - from epileptic seizures to Addison's Disease - and a whole lot of everything in between.  For the last several years he has a standing monthly appointment with Dr. Keiss to receive an injection. -- Throughout it all, Dr. Keiss and her staff have been wonderful to deal with, compassionate and giving.  I have always found that they will try one treatment option first, before moving on to the next, more expensive options.  Nothing like those other vets who are constantly trying to up-sell you and through you a whole laundry list of expensive treatments & testing.  I refer them to EVERYONE I meet - even strangers who are just walking by with their own pets :-)  I can't say enough about this clinic - nor could I ever thank them enough!<//Text>< Name>

Over the years, they've taken the best of care of all our beloved pets, including the current crop of five cats.   Dr. Keiss knows each of them personally!  The entire staff is wonderful and we thank every one of you for being there.
Many, many thanks from PoPo, Canoo, Dixie, Pokey and Fumé--and their humans.

Lisa and Renee at Pawsitive Therapy are absolute miracle workers!  My ten year old dog was completely paralyzed when I took him in for therapy - he walked out and is now his old self.  I could never thank them enough for their work with him.<//Review>

<text>I really enjoyed this location in H.B. which has only been open since May 2017. They have a clean, organized store and the team member who assisted me was friendly and processed my items I was selling quickly.  In comparison to the Santa Ana store (different owner) it has adopted a tech friendly system including a rewards program that gives a point for each dollar spent as a customer and a point for evey dollar they buy your items for! Happily returning soon.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-ArjEXRzuX37B0NvMQppsJvfWtcTwysNzvBec=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHqKu7scReXGghFzjlNnsiLUAgM5cNKp1JZac8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1510183677463, 'text': "Thank you so much, Brittany!

Does anyone know if the owner has hired new staff yet? And if they are actually looking through clothes? Last time I was here they didn’t open my bags and sent a text within 2 min of me handing my bags over saying they weren’t buying anything. When I called in advanced to ask what they were buying.  When I grabbed my bags nothing was opened or moved. I’d like to know if this has changed before I bring in my clothes. I use to come here all the time and sell my clothes, the lady time I was in there my skirt was on display up front. The new teenagers working there were so rude and acted like I was a inconvenience for them. To the OWNER please confirm that these issues have been resolved at this location</Text>

I was curious to see what Plato's Closet would purchase from me, so I brought a few items in to sell. They purchased 3 of the 4 items I had, but denied one item because it wasn't in style. Okay, I guess that's fair. What surprised me was the amount of good stuff they had to buy. I wasn't expecting to get anything, but they actually had some cool stuff. They seem to be selective of what they will buy, but the result is a quality store. If you're looking for a good deal, check it out.</text>

Organized sections to come buy trendy clothes. Brought my clothes to sell and they picked the trendy brand names and gave me a good reasonable cash back for them. Will come back to sell again.</text>

They bought your used clothes with better price compared with other stores. Just remember they will just focus on brand names. For cheaper brands, the clothes should be in really great condition ( almost like new) or come with the price tags. I sold my new clothes (not popular brand) to them but they did not choose them. My Zara pants and A&F shirts gave me $10 which was low but acceptable. In addition, the store has a nice smell of vanilla so that you do not recognize the used clothes smell which is a good thing.< /Review>

I brought in a large bag of clothes, almost all of which brand name and in nearly perfect condition. It took them nearly twenty minutes (they only said 10) to look through them, and they only picked out three items. A pair of boots, and two shirts from forever 21. For seven dollars. I paid seven dollars for the boots alone when I got them. I was obviously mad at this, but took the money none the less. I'm never coming back again, don't bring your clothes here. And as my dad says, the people bringing you clothes are your clients too, treat them like one.<//text><rate>2< /rate><user_id>108045456484167366342</user_id>< name>

I love this place! This store has the best selection of trendy clothes at the best prices anywhere. The mall is so expensive - my friends and I just go straight to Plato's now and we always walk out with great finds. I give this store a 10/10.</Text>

Hello everyone! I just dropped off two massive trash bags of clean clothes all still great quality women's clothes ages 18-24 designer & brand name clothes. When I came back to pick them up, they picked three items off of the top of the bags claiming that the rest were too "unsanitary" to look at. What does that even mean? I mean sure maybe there might have been a couple pieces of clothing that had stains on them that were not worth buying. But of the 200 pieces of clothing in there you couldn't find the time to actually dump the bags out & take a look? Did I mention the clothes were in the same spot they were when I left them? They didn't dump them out just saw one stain & made the ultimate decision that is was not worth looking through the rest. So buggy. I do not recommend going to this location. I called the South Coast location immediately after & they told me that they look through all of the clothes no matter what & decide what's not worth buying after having looked through everything. Like they are supposed to do. What's the point of bring clothes in to sell or donate if you're not going to take the time to look at them. Extremely disappointed. Do not go to this location.</review>

<date>1506462757906< /date><Rating>1</Rating><review>Hello everyone! I just dropped off two massive trash bags of clean clothes all still great quality women's clothes ages 18-24 designer & brand name clothes. When I came back to pick them up, they picked three items off of the top of the bags claiming that the rest were too "unsanitary" to look at. What does that even mean? I mean sure maybe there might have been a couple pieces of clothing that had stains on them that were not worth buying. But of the 200 pieces of clothing in there you couldn't find the time to actually dump the bags out & take a look? Did I mention the clothes were in the same spot they were when I left them? They didn't dump them out just saw one stain & made the ultimate decision that is was not worth looking through the rest. So buggy. I do not recommend going to this location. I called the South Coast location immediately after & they told me that they look through all of the clothes no matter what & decide what's not worth buying after having looked through everything. Like they are supposed to do. What's the point of bring clothes in to sell or donate if you're not going to take the time to look at them. Extremely disappointed. Do not go to this location.< /review>< pics>

<resp>{'time': 1506470994452, 'text': "Hi Calvin, we appreciate your feedback letting us know about your experience and I can understand your frustration. I'm the owner and I was here when the staff was going through your items and saw them pulling them out of the trash bags. I apologize if they didn't communicate with you effectively about what all the issues were and we'll work on that. I can assure you that we look through everything that comes in and we WANT to buy your clothing - that's how we stay in business and we appreciate all of our customers that sell to us - we love you guys! If you'd like to bring your items back I'll go through them personally with you and explain why we passed on each item. We base our decisions on style, condition, brand and demand and it's possible that you interpret those standards differently than we do. We also have certain items that we're overstocked on and certain items that we really need right now and we make decisions based on our inventory levels. Thank you for coming to our store and I hope you'll come talk to me the next time you're here so that we can understand each other even better. Take care!"}<//resp><gmapID>0x80dd2611fff0d693:0x4c2ec4d7b660d523< /gmapID></record>

<review>I don't reccomend selling items there. I went in to sell brand new pants with the tag on them from Styles for less, and a used still in good condition Mens Vans pullover hoodie worth 60 and for both they gave me $9 and some change. I had 2 pairs of heels that had only been worn once or twice, one of which were nice brown ones that had one tiny nick on the heel a little smaller than a grain of rice and said no to them for that reason. When there were 2 pair of Classic Vans they had been selling where the white gum part wasn't even white and clearly dirty! I was very surprised they were selling them, and a few black heels where they were dull and had fade spots! Mine compared to those were brand new! Her excuse was that sometimes they buy items and don't notice those things on accident. I even looked back at those vans they were selling and said "but those shoes are clearly dirty and you bought those to sell?" The Van's looked like mine that I was wearing that I've had for 2 months. Should of sold those maybe they would have bought them. Not pleased at all.<//review>< pictures>

Some of the pants and dresses are so old and raggy that i don't understand how somebody got money for such trash and even worst who made the decision to buy it! !! They have too much of everything that at the end I  ended up buying nothing, either too expensive, or too old, or ruined, or ugly!
Went twice just to give the place a second chance... it just reinforced my decision not to visit ever again.< /Text>< rating>

<Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1511463942652, 'text': "Hi Caitie, we appreciate your feedback and will use it to improve our procedures. I'm sorry we weren't able to offer you an amount that was agreeable to you for the items you brought in. There are many factors that we have to consider when sorting through clothing and making offers: the current demand of our customers, how much similar inventory we already have in stock, the style and brand, etc. We're also specifically looking for clothing that appeals to the 13-24 yr old female demographic. Although an item may have been purchased at retail for $100, it might not be the right type of clothing for our store, we may be overstocked on that item or it might not be in high demand. In those cases we offer less and as always you're free to keep your items and there's no pressure to sell it because we want you to be happy. In addition to the reasons listed above as to why we may have passed on your items or offered a low amount, sometimes we just make mistakes! It's not a perfect science and we're still learning as we go. We appreciate you coming into our store and hope it won't be the last time!"}</resp>< GmapID>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>I graduated in Fall of 2008.  I'm going to give a dead honest opinion of the school experienced as a chiropractic student.  I actually started in Fall 2002 after graduating USC in Kinesiology.   I was one of the top students in my chiropractic class until I started doing post graduate seminars every weekend as I found it more applicable to helping patients.  I took a hiatus from school in Summer 2003 to help a fiance at Johns Hopkins Medical School going through depression.

When I came back in Summer 2006, I picked up where I left off coming back with an addition of a naturopathic doctorate licensed in California.  By that time, I saw some old classmates in the upper term, but had a new class I enrolled with.

I was dating a new girl at the time and we went into open lab in the mornings so I can teach her.   We could have done it at her apartment but felt it was a healthier habit to go to school to practice as it was free from distractions.

Granted, I was very proficient in adjusting already and I was already a licensed naturopathic doctor with a scope to "manipulate" in California.  Paul Wanlass was in the open lab at the time and I think he was fairly new as a staff at the time.  He falsely accused me of adjusting my girlfriend, which I could have done in her bed 1 hour before openlab.  Yet, he raised it on such a level that made me have to commit to volunteer service for violating open lab policies. As I routinely did community service anyways and was the Rotaract USC founding president during undergrad, it didn't bother me except his ethics of targeting me was extremely questionable and made no sense.

It made more sense after I found out Paul Wanlass was a CHP officer and was fired in November 1992, subsequently "has been charged with six counts of unlawfully filing a police report, false arrest, obstructing an investigation and falsely reporting a crime, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Marc Kelly."₁  The poor victim was the target of a robbery and not drunk.  Looks like old habits die hard, Wanlass.  Made the whole experience at SCUHS sickening.  At least, I wasn't the dead guy being accused of being drunk!

<Review>Do not waste your time at this school, Please stay away, they have poor professionalism, quality of care, rude workers specifically at the billing center. They will tell you one price first and then on the day of payment tell you a 20% increased price. These people are not honest, and will steal from you, mind that if you do pay all this money you will get the worst customer service ever. I submitted a payment plan and never got a response back I had to initiate like hey I'm calling about my payment plan, they really set you up for failure. I asked to speak to a supervisor never got a call back. I cannot believe I had to pay $2,450 for a 100% online course. Be careful with hidden fees! They lie to you and will not help with solving any issues. I dunno if there is a Dean in the school but I have called many different "supervisors" never got an answer or call back, no one ever helped me solve my issue. Only one person was helping me from admissions but what was said from that person did not match with the billing department or register? STAY AWAY<//Review><Date>1558636682759</Date>< Pictures>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>SCU is a wonderful university offering many programs at the highest level of academics and scholarship.  I have found it to be an excellent institution in terms of their care for students, level of overall academics, and integrative model. First, faculty and staff are very friendly and helpful to all prospective and current students. They are always available to answer questions and help anyone however they can. I have had many experiences speaking with the staff and getting to know them and every experience has been very positive! In terms of academics, they are second to none with many accreditations including WSCUS (which also accredits many highly reputable universities such as Stanford). This means they are held to very high standards, however their office of academic support is very helpful because the programs are rigorous. I encourage everyone to learn more and join this amazing community!</Review>< pictures>

< review>
Southern California University of Health Sciences is a sham and the employees there are bullies! Don't waste your time, and more importantly your money applying or attending.

I applied to both their DC and PA programs and was first accepted into their DC program. After my acceptance, I kept receiving admissions emails regarding my "admission to their PA program." When I called the school to report the irregularity, I was told by Ms Elizabeth Cruz the email had been sent in error. Strangely, Ms Elizabeth Cruz also told me at that time that applicants were expected to be "professional throughout the application process." - Apparently Ms Elizabeth Cruz says this to "everyone" (despite never saying this to me at any time during our previous phone calls before that).

It wasn't after I called to follow up on my PA application (months later) that I was told (more so screamed at) by Mr David Coronado, who told me I would not be accepted into their PA program and that my DC acceptance had been rescinded because I had "altered" their admission emails... When I tried to ask where this accusation was coming from, Mr David Coronado refused to let me speak and threatened to report me to CASPA. When I tried to justify the validity of the emails I had received, Mr Coronado raised his voice at me and told me that my opinion did not matter.

Well after months of being told I'd get a call back from the dean of the DC and PA program (which never occurred), I was able to settle the situation with the school and obtain an apology. The school did in fact report me to CASPA and I was also able to obtain a retraction for their libelous claim. At this point I have no desire to attend this school and was glad to see the reality about SCUHS before becoming part of the student body.

Ultimately SCUHS and its staff lack the professionalism required to operate a health sciences school and SCUHS' action only discredits the legitimacy of the school. While SCHUS is tasked with training our future healthcare providers, the school doesn't seem to know what it is doing at the administrative level...</review>

The professor was inconsistent, and did not set up how students to succeed. Everything was unorganized and the lectures were rushed. Don't take a class here if you actually want to understand the concepts. It is not worth the money AT ALL. I even had difficulty trying to receive my transcripts for this class.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>Very long lines with most of the time only one register open,  if you want to grab an item really quick and go,  set aside at least 30 minutes to wait in line. Fast customer service is not the focus of the manager at this store<//Review>< date>

<review>Staff is very friendly and professional. Also the store had all the items I was shopping for at reasonable prices.  From household items to auto items. Family Dollar is a great store.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<Review>Some items have a price on them and when paying they are marked a $1 more. Plus tax.
So difficult, when paying management isn't on site.< /Review><UserId.>102815407038071949173< /UserId.><gmapID>0x80ea13b6f9ef3157:0x236c05342471070c</gmapID>< Response>

Everytime I go in I'm greeted with a smile, the store is well kept. I just wished their price checker machine worked. Overall I have no complaints, all employees are very friendly.< /text>

<Review>Everything was nicely done, I did the quick pick up and there were several cars to choose from and the drop off was just as quick.  While this is important the most is the people, they were friendly and helpful.  Today customer service is a surprise rather than a norm and I was pleasantly surprised.  Only comment is to squeegee the windows & side mirrors instead of a towel drying.  The towel leaves towel spots and in the sunlight is fine but in the evening with car lights they do make things harder to see and since I'm in an area I'm unfamiliar with visibility if key.  Otherwise the interior was perfect but I'm picky on my windows</Review>< resp>

<rating>4</rating><text>National Car Rental has the easiest rental process of any car rental company.  You make your reservation and when you get there, you just walk right out to the lot, choose your car and drive to the exit.  Hand them your license and you are good to go.  I always like to get something fun to drive when I travel and the Dodge Challenger fit the bill.  They also had a wide selection of more 'reasonable" cars, mid size trucks and SUV's to choose from.  Prices change but I was able to rent this car for just over $40 a day.  My only complaint is with the quantity of vehicles available during peak times.  Every company that rents there doesn't seem to have enough vehicles to satisfy the demand.</text>< resp>

<Review>I love the fact I can walk down an aisle and pick the car I want as an  Emerald Club member!  Each person we dealt with was personable and helpful.  We got off our flight, got to the rental center, walked straight to the Emerald Club aisle, picked a car, drove off, showed our license at the gate and were gone.  Literally a 5 minute process!  Amazing!<//Review>< time>

< Review>
I have been a very loyal customer for almost 8 years.  I have sent these reviews with always a max rating.
But today it's different.  I have been asking for Nat'l to have their drivers that return cars to the lot lower the seats because I always hit my head when entering the car. And to this day! Nothing has ever been done.
Also the car was washed, but still wet over all the windows plus inside windows were dirty.  There was mud on the floor door jam that should have been cleaned prior to delivering the car.
This is not an isolated incident!  I travel the Western US and only use Nat'l. This seems to be at most of the rental yards. Cars not cleaned, Seats not lowered and the biggest pet peeve is the tank is not full when i select a car.  This has only happened twice in 7.5 years.
I hope management sees this and acts instead of sending a nice response letter.
I am a loyal customer and always will be. But i need to vent today! Thanks< /Review>

Horrible service!  Changed rental reservation price at pick up.  I have been emerald elite with National for more than 10 years, never had problem like the one I did at SMF.  Reservation was made a month before, and when driving out from Emerald aisle, I was told the rate would change unless I can show proof of the contract.  I had the contract ID in profile for years through alumni association, did not have any proof at 9pm when my family is in the car.  The agent, Carlos and his supervisor Gianni are rude and condescending, claiming there have been a lot of fraud, when my family travel in first class and it's a 2-day rental!  I told him it’s the principle that if you questioned my contract let me know when the reservation is made, not when I am already driving out.  I could have easily use AAA or some other contract, instead of paying rate without any.

I would never rent from National SMF again.  It brought a bad start to our vacation, gave National and Sacramento an abhorrent image!  Go with anyone else in SMF.</text>

<review>I arrived to pick up the car at 7 a.m.  There were several pickups available, but I knew how much luggage I had and I really wanted to be able to lock it up since I would be driving for 12 hours.  Andrew Tang was working in the National Car Rental booth and I asked if there was a minivan available.  He went out of his way to find me a minivan and I was on my way within 10 minutes of arrival.  He was very professional, very helpful and when I drove away, National Car Rental had a very happy customer.  National Rental Car should value Andrew as an employee because he provided service that will make customers return to National Rental Car.  He is invaluable!<//review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1615968633697, 'text': 'Thank you again for taking the time to let us know how we did. We hope you have a great day!

< Review>
I can’t say enough about this National station. In general National is awesome. The folks at Sacramento are the best. Nothing but great customer service and experiences. Anytime there is a small issue it’s addressed on site.  I e encountered Brian Hitchcock a few times and this guy needs to be promoted! He knows his customers and takes care of them. I recently had an issue with an overdue car and Brian and. Melissa sorted it out for me in no time. I doubt I’d get the same response from Hertz or Avis. Keep up the great work!</Review>

<text>April at the Sacramento Airport location provided excellent customer service and went above and beyond today. I left my cell phone in the rental and when I realized it, the car had already been driven off the drop off location. April went and found it for me and returned it to me. I am so grateful for her help!</text>< rate>

Team at National got us the right car. Staff friendly and vehicle(VW- Atlas ) worked great for our trip to Crater lake. 4 adults comfortable with luggage and decent mileage. Definitely recommend them for your next rental.</Review>

Reservations are easy, employees are Pros, prices are good, transactions -- picking up/returning -- couldn't be easier.  I was a loyal Hertz customer for 15 years, then National beat Hertz at their own game.  I'm not denigrating Hertz - they're excellent.  But National is better.<//Review>

<review>Being an Emerald member through my credit card I booked a premium car for pickup at Sacramento airport.  When I arrived I proceeded directly to the lot to find 2 minivans and a small pickup truck parked in the lot and a very unfriendly attendant that met each of my questions with an unapologetic "This is what we have available". Ordinarily I would not be all that upset to drive a pickup, but I reserved a premium car, a car, not a minivan or a truck.  Furthermore, there were plenty of other cars not parked in the "emerald" section so the answer that was all that was available was not very believable, more like that is all I am willing to do for you.  I was really optimistic for this "emerald" experience that just did not happen, National won't be my first choice next time around regardless of the status.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Review>We rented from National at Sacramento, California. We used the Emerald Aisle. We got a car that met our needs. I especially like the way we can just go to the aisle, pick the car we like and drive to the exit to check out. I didn't need to stop at the desk at all. When we brought the car back, we just met the agent at the exit aisle, they checked mileage and car condition and we were set to go. Got the receipt via email. Easy process. I recommend National to anyone who rents cars for business or pleasure.</Review>< Pics>

<review>I enjoy renting from National.  The Emerald Aisle program is great, just pick a Car in the aisle and drive off.  The only issue is that the last three times I've Rented at the Sacramento Airport the cars have smelled of smoke.  I cannot stand the smell of cigarette smoke, even if it's masked.<//review>< name>

Friendly employees, easy to get a car and drop off. Was a little surprised with how few cars they had in the lot but that could all just be timing of when we arrived. Overall would recommend National for their ease of use and safety of cars.</Review>

Pricing was very misleading. I was initially overcharged by >2X what I was quoted. At least I was able to get Customer Service to correct it, but only after 3 attempts.

And one more thing, the agent at the counter refused to put on his mask.< /review>

<review>There was not an emplohe to assist us at the Emerald Aisle. When I went back to the rental car building the employee was not very attentive.  Said there was someone there. There was still no employee when i returned.  I selected a vehicle and then exited.  It was very strange that there was not the level of service i expected.  Car was OK and the price was what was quoted.

Overall OK experience - definitely not what i have experienced in the past.< /review></record></dataset><record>

I use national regularly for business trips. I recently signed up for emerald club due to having issues with vehicles being too small. I am taller and it was great being able to pick and out a vehicle that would accommodate my height. Before traveling I checked to see if the emerald aisle was available at the Sacramento location due to everything going on with Covid which the app reflected that it was open. When I arrived that was not the case. I was told by a gentleman with dark hair and glasses that I could not choose the vehicle. I mentioned that I prefer something with more head space if possible. I was given the keys and when I walked out to the car sure enough the seat in the car I was given didn’t go back far enough. I decided to pay out an extra $94.79 that was not covered by my company to get a vehicle that was bigger. I was told at the counter that it was a Ford Explorer. It was actually a Ford Escape that sits higher but is actually smaller then the first vehicle. The dark hair gentleman with glasses angrily tossed keys of a third vehicle to another associate and said “just give him the journey”. I didn’t mean to upset anyone. Normally my experience with national is great! I fully understand that things were probably out of his hands but I really wish he could of displayed better customer service.

<Review>The person who brought me my reservation seem to be inconvenienced because our flight was early.  The luxury SUV had bugs all over the windshield and smelled of cigarette smoke.  We had already packed the vehicle and everyone was loaded, so I dealt with it.  The next morning when I walked up to the vehicle, I noticed the driver side front tire had no tread on the inside of the tire.  With over 25k miles, no wonder.  This car should not be part of the National luxury collection.  It should have been sent to Enterprise along time ago.  The young lady who checked me in was very helpful and what I am used to when being help from National employees.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I revised this review because they paid for my Uber and jump start fees.
Thanks .   I reserved a large suv several week’s before our trip because we planned on taking the grand kids and daughter shopping and visit local attractions.
When we arrived at the airport rental location site the vehicle was not waiting for us.   The attendant stating “ Oh let me see if I can go find one”
A few minutes later he drives up in a very dusty inside and out Nissan Armada.  It smelled more like smoke inside than the outside air did.  The door sills  were dirty .  This vehicle in my opinion had not been cleaned up after the last rental.   All was well until we visited a nearby pumpkin farm.
It was 95 degrees plus out side and when we had had as much heat as we
Could stand we headed back to the truck to head home.    When I tried to start the truck it only clicked.  We called Uber to take the family home and out of the 95 degrees.   I called National Car Roadside service to get them to come start the vehicle they said it should be about 45 minutes.   At an hour I called and they said were 10 minutes out.  At two hours I called back and they said they had to change vendors.    I called back at three hours and they said someone canceled both service calls.   I then called a local service guy and paid him to come start the  vehicle.  After paying him I was on my way.
That was 4 hours waiting on National in a field at 95 degrees.
At no time did a national personal take ownership of there vehicle & customer issues.    I have rented from National hundreds of times over the years and have never received this kind of service.< /text>

Got to Sacramento about 8pm local time. Wasn't sure if I was a "go straight to the car" member or not, so stopped by the front desk first. A friendly young lady team member welcomed me, then guided me to the pick-your-car area. Once outside, a young gentleman guided me further, letting me know which lanes of vehicles I could choose from. Picked a Malibu, loaded luggage, and was on my way. Thanks for making it easy!< /Review>

When the attendant said the keys were in the vehicle, there was only the valet key. Which meant that every time I unlocked the car, the alarm would go off until I started the engine. Very annoying. I also couldn’t unlock any of the other doors for people riding in the car until the car had started. So they had to stand outside with the alarm going off until I started the engine. I had the rental from Friday to Monday. During that time, national contacted me because they did not properly link my vehicle to my contract so they actually did not know what car I was even driving. I had to send them a picture of the barcode on the windshield. Normally, national is my preferred rental car service, I’m even an executive elite member, but this was very bad business on their part.</Review>

Manager picked it for me which I did not like. My company change the contract. Manager kept contract and price the same. Now this car has 2 lights on dash. There us no manua in carl for me to see what these light mean. At this point I don't know what to do!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Time>

I travel all over the country and always use National as it’s my companies contracted partner for rentals.

Sacramento is my absolute hands down favorite location to rent from.  I often arrive in the evening and Bob or Jesse always remember me and go out of their way to accommodate me with excellent clean fully loaded vehicles to rent.  Bob and Jesse go the extra distance for me and I really appreciate them!< /Text>

First rental with this company.  Car was very fresh and, while not totally loaded, was packed with convenience and safety features.  Price was in line with what everyone else was offering and their "skip the line" process was great since there were about 6 people waiting in line to claim their vehicle.  Do yourself a favor and sign up for their Emerald Club online.  It's well worth the 15 min sitting at your computer rather than 30 min standing in line with your luggage and any other people you have with you.< /Text>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Not sure if I posted a National Car Rental review before and please know that this isn't a review chiding the company as a whole, just those persons I encountered at Sacramento Intl Airport. I tried to explain to them that I was a Emerald Elite member. This means that I could pick anything I want with the exception of Premier vehicle selections. Instead of just saying they didn't have any of those vehicles. I had no problem selecting at every other National Car Rental I visited before, they told me that I had to pay an upcharge for vehicles I rented with no issues in the past. Either the staff didn't understand how upgrades work or they had a problem with me. I will be contacting National Car rental tomorrow and update this post with my findings.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Arrived at Sacramento airport late and to National Car rental at about 11:30 or midnight.  The Executive Elite section was easy to find but had very few cars to choose from.  The best choice of vehicles smelled of marijuana strongly enough that we could smell it on our clothing after leaving the vehicle.  The experience was probably bad enough to consider a higher priced rental car company in the future.< /review>

<Time>1596120404606<//Time><Rating>4</Rating><Review>I travel a decent amount for work and leisure and have rented many cars from many companies.p

As usual National offers the best experience for renting cars. Hertz, enterprise and all the budget type companies never deliver an equal product to what National offers. The car was spotless (almost never the case with most other companies),  Emerald Aisle is by far the best approach to "rental counters" and the selection of cars available was plentiful.

Now for the bad. This was the first time I have rented a car from National that I had a few negative experiences.  First, they added all the "optional" insurances without asking me. Second, I told them I didn't want to prepay gas and the attendant checking me out said it was already selected and he couldn't change it.  These "options" cost me 80 dollars. Considering it was a one day rental it just about doubled my price. Thats not ok.

Second, is they wouldnt take my debit card. I was told policy is at an airport I have to have an outgoing flight and ticket number to use a debit card or I can only use a credit card. What? That is the most ridiculous policy I have ever heard. Usually I travel for work and use my company card. This time I was moving cross country to California and only needed a car for one day while mine was being delivered. I am not sure if this is a standard policy but its absolutely ridiculous.

Summary, National is the best rental company. They ripped me off on this rental but never have before. They wouldn't take a debit card.<//Review>< pictures>

This most recent experience was amazing. National has lived up to its stellar reputation as a car rental location that prioritizes customer service and that offers valuable upgrades to its members having status.

Mo took great care of me, going out of his way to find me a SUV that I needed for my trip.

Thank you, National!

< review>
I have Exec Elite status with National and reserved the emerald aisle rate to choose a vehicle. When I arrived they had sedans and three SUVs. When I approached one of the SUVs the staff member told me they were reserved for people who reserved this category. The employee stated they had other SUVs but we're saving them for people who reserved this class. This is a deviation from the normal reservation process for the status customers and wasn't disclosed ahead of time. Had I known I would have gone to Hertz because I needed an SUV or at least a truck. The sedans they had that were roomy enough for gear and luggage both stunk of cigarettes. Half way up to our destination my friend's son was experiencing an asthma attack because of the concentration of cigeratte smell in the car. He was nauseous and sick the remainder of the way, which I felt bad for.
To add to this horrible experience when we got back the check in process made me feel like an employee not a valued customer. The woman who checked us in approached the car making demands. "Turn the car on, roll the windows down and leave the keys in the cup holder." I walked out to help unload our gear and didn't roll all the windows down so the employee told me in a very loud manner "I said roll the windows down."
While I understand Covid has changed the way we do things it shouldn't mean give up on customer service. I won't be renting from National again, the service has gone downhill and that was the only reason I rented from them because price wise they can certainly be beat!</review>

<Review>As a National Emerald Club member, I intentionally went through them so that I could get a RAV-4 for a weekly rental while our car was in the shop.  I specifically indicated in the reservation that I wanted the RAV-4, and I even confirmed this by phone with the local renting location two days in advance of pick-up that we wanted a RAV4.  Naturally, when I went to pick up the car, not only were there no RAV-4's to be found, but the staff told me I would get "a better SUV, a Mitsubishi."  As I choked that down, and was then provided a Jeep that was a poor rental, I decided that I'd likely not use National again.< /Review>< Pics>

Renting with National was fast and easy at the Sacramento, CA airport.  One of the quickest to get through if you can utilize the 'bypass-the-counter' option.  I've recently rented from Avis and Budget at the same location...no comparison, National is better in every facet from pickup to return.</review>

I'm a big guy (6'5" 265 lbs.) and greatly appreciate the ability to choose my own vehicle. I fit decently in the Altima and have also had luck at some airports finding a full size Dodge truck, which happens to be my personal vehicle.

Thank you National for the very reasonable rental rates, good vehicle selection and great customer service. You make the others look like rookies.

Go Like A Pro!

Pretty expensive.  If you are an exec club member, I think they assume you are just renting from them and not checking prices.  Not as good of a value as you might expect.  Easy to use up front and easy to drop off.  However, if you have any problems with the car along the way you better have an extra 1-3 days in your schedule to get these guys to honor their replacement and roadside guarantees or just suck it up and find a new rental company.  Their customer service folks call back, but definitely NOT convenient if you have a tight schedule and/or they can't service or replace the car at all.  AND if you get broken into and have to deal with their damage recovery group, god help you.  They are as heavy handed and rude as any low budget medical bill collections agent you may have been forced to deal with in your life and they don't care how many car you have rented or if you ever rent from them again.  AND  if you over pay them on a damage claim because they bill you and your insurance simultaneously, they have no urgency whatsoever to get you your money back.  Still fighting with them on that one now for 30 days.....</text>

I appreciate National Car Rental's Sacramento Airport location.  They are easy to access, and I can be on the road in less that 5 mins from arriving at the car rental hub.  Beyond that, they have a great selection of vehicles for a 6'6" person to drive comfortably.  I will definitely use them again on my next trip.< /text>

The people at Sacramento airport were great. When I got out to the cars, there was Nissan Frontier. It's one of my favorite rides. This one had a tiny screen in the dashboard, no iPhone interface like many cars do now, and it was not clean inside. Other than that, it drove well and I had a good trip.</Text>

Very easy to reserve a car, pickup and drop off. Everything is online, no waiting in lines to pickup a car and multiple cars to choose from. Drop off is easy also, nothing to sign, receipt is emailed to you instantly. The more you rent, the better the cars.<//text>

It was so quick to get service. It took under 10-15 mins to get my rental car. I loved that I was able to choose my vehicle from the available vehicles that fell into the car type/price point that I was renting at! I own a jeep so I really liked that I was able to select a Jeep model! The selection process was completely new to me and different from the other competitors. I would definitely rent with them again and suggest them to a friend!

Please note, this next statement applies to all the rental car companies out of the Sacramento Airport (Hertz, Avis, National, etc). The only con was the wait for the buses to get back to the airport on a busy day in the afternoon/evening its the same bus for all customers of all the rental car companies. There was a very long line for the bus that took you to the terminal that had majority of the airlines (forget if it was A or B - I flew Alaska). I ended up just ordering a Lyft to get to the airport because I could expense it through my company. However, it is important to note and plan for or else I could have missed my flight since I did not plan for that.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

I really liked the quick pick up isle for the car and also the quick drop off too. But what I didn't like was although I could choose which car to take I notice they were all the same models. So in reality there is no real choice of cars, a little bit disappointed.<//Text>

<Review>Recently rented an AWD vehicle for Lake Tahoe.    When we were headed back to the airport, it snowed and the vehicle wouldn't engage the AWD.  I hit the button and the light wouldn't stay on.  I had to buy chains and have someone put them on and take them off so that we could get over the pass and make it to out flight on time.  The chains were $130 and $50 to put on and remove, so $180 total.  I left the chains in the vehicle.  Hopefully someone can use them.  I told the agent when I returned the vehicle.  He said "Oh..that's too bad."  I sure would like a refund or some free rental days to off set the $180 that I spent.</Review><GmapID>0x809b2b0f343b8021:0xd344193333018566<//GmapID>< resp>

Excellent customer service at Sacramento.  I had reservations at competitor, who denied me a rental because my drivers license name didn't match credit card (recent divorce). On a whim I went to National counter and was treated with respect to find solution,  I had email copy of divorce decree,  was able to get car and proceed with vacation.  All because they were able to take the time to find a solution and help me and my boys!!<//text>

Ever since Hurricane Harvey, I've been a big fan of National car rental.  I like the pick any car in the lane feature, so I can get a car that meets my needs when I arrive at the Airport.   We picked up a rental car at Austin to drive back to Houston after Hurricane Harvey hit in the summer of 2017.  Since the Airport was closed, I went to the desk with the bill I received, and the quickly took the extra days off my rental since they were not open and I couldn't return the car.  I was very happy with their decision to not try and charge me for the extra days I was forced to have my rental car.  They earned a customer for life that day.</review>

Car styles were not represented well between website and location. Reserved “choose your car from the row” $70/day rate on the web. When I arrived, I was offered a Hyundai, but said I could upgrade. A Hyundai is NEVER worth $70/day. Only option was to upgrade to chose my car from the row. Whatever. Did that, and only 3 car options on the row: Hyundai, Nissan, and one Jeep. Chose the Jeep only to be told it was not available AFTER we got in and drove to the checkout point. We had to drive it back, get out, and choose a Nissan. It was ok; the car worked fine and the staff were very nice. The hassle of it all will make me hesitate before renting from National again.</Text>

<text>My experience would be a 5 star except that I was surprised to find that my rental had a 30 cents a mile charge because I was returning it to a different airport.

<text>I’ve gotten tired of trying to communicate with National through their means, so let’s see if things change through Google.

The rental situation here is worse than it needs to be. For an off-site facility, it takes a good 30-45 min to get a car when you’re about 3/4 of a mile away.

This location has an absolutely horrendous selection. This past instance is a prime example of how poorly managed this National Car Rental location is run. 5 people, besides myself, were lost in the lot because there were only pickups and minivans. That’s just shameful. I had to wait nearly 30 minutes just for a simple sedan.

National has continued to go downhill. Avoid at all costs, and find a rental agency who actually cares about your business.< /text>< pictures>

After waiting 20 minutes without any movement in the line which for the company from which I had reserved a car AND observing the National counter with countless people coming & going, I bolted to the National counter. Should have done it sooner! I was out of there in 3 minutes, maybe less.  Efficient, pleasant....excellent check out.  I found the same efficiency when returning the rental. National is not the cheapest but they get you on your way quickly. National is now my go to for car rentals.</text>

<Review>Very easy to get in and out.  Not many different types of vehicles available, but plenty of cars to pick up when i arrived.  Granted it was the holidays, so I was excited that they had so many cars.  I was able to get a car with only 8000 miles on it.  It was very convenient to be able to pick up in the Sacramento Airport and drop off at the Fresno Airport.  I spent maybe 15-20 minutes at the rental facility total between both ends.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Review>I like National.  I would add a half star if I could.  The downside is the selection is not always very good. Depending on the city and the weekend it can be ZERO cars, even with a reservation and Emerald Club Executive Elite® status.  Believe me. More than once I have been in a city (Lubbock comes to mind) where their were no cars at all and I was told "sorry".  That's it, sorry?  No car, no reimbursement for a cab I should not have needed. No offer for a free rental for the inconvenience. NOTHING!

Part of that has to do with the fact that a lot of folks are top tier status, particularly because National specifically targets the business crowd. I can tell you a lot of us rent a lot!  Getting the 25 paid rentals or 85 paid rental days in a calendar year is easy for most regular travelers. There in lies the rub.  It's to easy.

My colleagues and I regularly hit between 175 and 225 days a year.  Yet we are no different than those who hit the minimum. It would seem that if you have customers who are setting a standard that high there would be a tier that rewarded that kind of loyalty. Call it a Concierge Tier or some other fancy name. I remember renting from Hertz back in the day when I was Hertz Gold, the O.J days.  They had my desired car in a stall with my name on a board telling me where to find my ride.  That is the kind of service a true road warrior deserves. I want a Pacifica or 300C waiting for me. Not finding the only options left on the lot are half a dozen Camaro's with a giant neon sign above them saying "pull me over". (Happened more than once in Seattle).

So if you are looking for budget rentals there are a lot of cheaper options out there.  But if you travel a lot and  like that you can (almost always) have a selection of most any size car you want waiting for you, with a first come first served caveat, then this is the place for you.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>I always used to recommend National. This last rental really changed my opinion. I rented a Nissan Altima from the Sacramento Airport National Car Rental Hub.  The tires seemed to be a little worn, but not too bad at a glance. Wasn’t many others to choose from anyway...

I made it to my hotel room to rest for the evening. I left the car parked in the hotels garage. In the morning I came out to find the rear drivers side tire flat. I called National Road Side Assistance and they explained what could happen. AAA would put a spare on and I could either exchange the car for another at the airport or get the tire replaced at a tire shop near by. The operator went on to explain the the shop may have to call to get the approval for the work, but it would not be an issue.

Upon arrival to the Firestone Tire Shop, I explained the situation. They went through their standard operating procedures, got all the info, and called for approval. When answered by the operator at the airport they were denied. The operator explained that even though Firestone is contracted to work on their vehicles they would not cover the cost. I was Told I had To Pay For The Replacement. Which actually meant all 4 tires because of the wear on them. They said I could keep the receipt and be reimbursed when I return the car.

I refused to pay. After being on hold for 5-10 mins on several occasions, I was then told I could exchange it at a near by Enterprise. What? I rented the car from YOU, National.

The Firestone shop then ran the parts and labor through Enterprise and after about 45mins it was approved!

3.5 hrs later. After missing work. Being lied to. Endangered on a spare and bald tires. I found out National rented the car from Enterprise and refused me basic contract services.

I used the car the rest of the week and returned it to National at the end of the week. Thanks for the awful experience and lost wages.

Shout out to the Firestone shop on IKEA dr in West Sacramento, Ca! Thanks for working with me and getting me a safe ride.< /Text>< pictures>

I love the professionalism and selection of cars. I have only one complaint: the windshields are never clean...please use clean cloths for cleaning, otherwise, you have the streaking that I consistently see on every car that I've rented thus far.

I have to say this was THE BEST car rental experience of my life. National provided me with detailed instructions on where to find the shuttle bus and the Emerald Isle. The staff was super friendly and helpful... I was in my car and on the road in less than 3 minutes and the return was just as simple. Also, kudos to the staff that cleans the cars, my car was much cleaner than most rentals. Why can't all car rentals be this streamlined? A+++<//Review>

They check your dl at the gate and that's it.  When you return, they scan your car back in and give you a receipt right there. No counters or lines anywhere.  Usually a good selection of cats, too.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>Great first-car-rental experience! Super easy to reserve online, just walked up to a car and drove away, cars are super new and clean, and there are no hidden fees! My one downside of the experience is that I had a late arrival to the airport and really had to scram to get to the National car rental location before they closed at midnight. I wish they would stay open a little bit longer after the last arrivals of the night.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Time>1581172165582<//Time><rating>2<//rating><Text>I rent a lot of cars. Previously I had been solely renting with a competitor. That competitor created the opportunity for me to test another car rental company. I posted on LinkedIn the request of who my network of 24k+ uses. 80% that responded said ‘National’.

So I setup the app, became an emerald member and booked (2) rentals as a test.

I found the rates to be 10-20% more with the same features (Pre-purchased fuel refueling program).

Rental 1: I returned the car with just under 1/4 tank missing (about 3 gallons). Fuel refueling charge was over $80. Did not match the agreed rate per gallon.

2) rental 2: I had to change my travel and would return the car to a new airport. With my previous rental company this is a $200 charge plus the rental fee as a comparison.

I called national because the app did not allow me to do so easily. The customer service person was great but told me the one day extension and return was going to be $483. The rep could not explain the charges or break them down.

He suggested I return the car and re-rent a new car on a one way rental. I checked and the rental would have been $283.00

I rented with AVIS for $203 *including the fuel refueling service.

Rental 2:  original was from airport in St Louis MO pick up and return. I ended up picking up in StLouis, returned to St Louis and rented from AVIS from St Louis to Indianapolis.

The manager at National St Louis Airport location listened, but offered nothing different than customer service agent. I wanted to discuss with a manager just in case I had a new person and they didn’t understand procedure.

In the scope of life not the end of the world. In Buisness disappointing: more cost, policy is not logical and no corrective action offered when presented the details.

Positive: the manager allowed an employee at National to use the car I had rented to shuttle me directly to AVIS! :)

Other positive: National employees were awesome to deal with. Super easy to navigate the process. Cars were clean and all worked great.< /Text>< pictures>

<Rating>3< /Rating><text>I really like the concept of bypassing the counter and selecting my own car along the aisle.  My only complaint though is that the car selection between the Emerald aisle versus the Executive is almost no difference.  What should be a nicer car in Executive could easily be what you find in the Emerald aisle.  I rent from National about every other week so I have racked up quite a few points, I haven't used the free car rentals yet, but from what I understand you can only use 3 days at a time, this is also disappointing as well.  National needs to pick up their game with better cars and allow better use of free rentals before I see them worthy of a 5 star rating.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

The Sacramento airport National Car Rental took good care of me on a recent business trip.  As I arrived the lot was lacking models for me to select from.  One of the associates asked if I was looking for anything special, I told him what I was interested in and wham, bam, just like that the model I requested was there for me, all gassed up, washed, and ready to go.</text>

Ya know, I typically reserve the cheapest car I can find when I'm paying for it, and that hasn't been National.  But I recently was on a business trip and my employer booked a car from National.  All I can say is, my word! What a difference!  Quick, efficient, friendly counter people.  An upgrade from what was booked helped, but still.   Finally, the car.  Oh my word, a CLEAN, nice car.  I've been convinced.  On my personal rentals, I'll pay the few extra bucks and go National!< /text>

<text>Customer service came through like champs -- two emails to me and a free day's rental, plus the original free day.  I changed my rating from two to five stars.  I will leave the original post in case anyone is waiting for a plane, or missed a flight and has lots of time.  Again, thanks and kudos to National for the super service.
Original post by me:   Usually, I consider my experience with National Car Rental to be 5-star rating, from the people on the lots to the people on the phones.  But this last one was a disaster, I write not to chide them but to warn other customers:  I rented a Dodge mini-van at the Sacramento airport.  It had automatic door locks which drive me nuts.  When I dropped my family off at the departure gate, I was going to return the rental and join them inside.  As I closed the tailgate, the car locked with the keys inside, along with my suitcase and cell phone.  Whether I hit a wrong button or it locked on its own, I don’t know (I personally witnessed a friend’s Dodge lock him out as we were standing beside it).  That’s when things went from bad to worse. My son called National, and was told nothing could be done but call AAA and it would take up to 90 minutes for someone to get out.  Foolishly and against the clerk’s advice, we asked to talk to the National desk at the airport, certain they had a way to open the car.  Instead, I was connected to the most inept person I have encountered by phone.  It took him a half an hour to enter a few basic facts before AAA was summoned.  It turned out that coincidentally a service person was at the airport already, but by the time he found me, unlocked the car, I returned it, and took the shuttle back, I missed my flight. The next day I called customer service to make sure that I was not charged the $58 AAA fee – supposedly, someone, perhaps the bumbling clerk, had already reversed the charges, though I am holding my breath on that one.  The customer service person graciously gave me one-day free rental.  I have never, never, left the keys to any car on the dash unless I first roll down a window.  This was the first and last time.  The bumbling clerk told me this happens “frequently.”  So why in the world doesn’t National disable automatic locks or otherwise take steps to prevent locking keys in the car, as is becoming routine with new cars?  I still prefer National Car Rental above all others, but after this dismal experience I have a lot of “notes to self” about rental cars and their keys.</text><user_id>107342719437873567983<//user_id><resp>{'time': 1566934186375, 'text': 'Evan Jones, we would like to look into this further.

Was traveling about two weeks ago and ended up having an awful experience with Dollar Rental. I walked a couple booth over and was greeted by a welcoming smile. Behind the counter was Cheryl, the most friendly person I'd come in contact with all day. She went above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of. Because of Cheryl and National Car rental I was able to see my father after 10 years! Thank you for an amazing experience.<//review>

<Review>I have been an Emerald Aisle member since 1993. I have never had a problem with any of the rentals,. There have been no misunderstandings and it has been the quickest and least expensive way to rent a car at an Airport. We have picked up 3 or 4 brand new cars off the Emerald Aisle and many more with less than 1000 miles.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1560634538645, 'text': "Finnbarr Polc, it's experiences like yours that really keep us motivated!- LIZ P"}< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<Pics>None</Pics><Review>Such an easy car rental.  Just showed up and picked out a car.  Got into the car and drove to the gate.  Showed my license and drove away.  Drop off was just as easy.  Drove in and stopped the car.  Gathered my things, said hello to the return rep & told him the car was full of gas, and walked away.  The most time consuming thing was waiting for the airport shuttle.< /Review>< user_name>

I like National in general, but not this specific location.

Options were limited. Seems like they keep the better cars parked separately, and as an Executive Elite member, I couldn't choose anything nice or what I wanted.

Another complaint, their cars don't get washed every time. I drove a dirty one both of the times I rented at Sac. Also, the car I had, was last serviced at 7k miles(had a sticker), and it was already over 20k, so I pointed that out to them later, that the car hasn't had an oil change for over 13k, whick is too much even for synthetic, which they should change every 7k about for optimal engine performance.<//text>

Everything was seamless. The selection was all Nissan and Chevy. Our Altima performed well, but they are low riding and underpowered—especially for the California freeways.
The rental car bus is not Nationals fault but it is remarkably irritating. The airport needs to redesign. The lines are staggering and trying to get to the end of the line is uncommonly hard.<//review>

I am not a fan of National.  First of all they give you 2 keys all the time and that is hard to carry around and to put in your pocket.  Second their cars are dirty and have a lot of miles on them.  Third their staff is untrained and unprofessional.  Fourth they don't use CLEAR like Hertz for checkout and the process takes forever.  Fifth the app they have to try and speed up the checkout takes forever and saves no time.  Sixth they don't have cars with toll tags in them like Hertz.  It takes an additional 5 minutes at checkout to get one . Lastly they charge more than Hertz for the toll tag.  Avoid National.</Review>

<text>National Car rentals check in team saved my flight home.  After hitting unexpected traffic delays I arrived shortly before boarding time. At the Sacramento air port you must take a bus to the tram to reach your gate. The attended (who I wish I had got his name) pulled an employee to jump in the rental care and drive me to the gate. saving all the transportation stops. It was the last fight to my final destination that day.  flight date 7-31-19 at 5:30PM to SNA.
I am a National rental car customer for life.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Are you an avid traveler, and flying out from an airport to whatever destinations frequently?  If you are, you should join and become a member of National Car Rectal's Emerald Club.  I have been a member  of it more than 15 years, and have been traveling and enjoying my life visiting all places around the Country.  The secret is that National  Car rental affords me the  easy, convenient and affordable  way to get a rental car wherever I go.  I wouldn't have been able to travel so extensively without this wonderful car rental company.< /Review>

This is the easiest most accessible service I've found.  The rewards are limited, but the choice of vehicle is great with very little delay in departure or arrival.</Review>

Usually I have a smooth experience renting from National. Sacramento Airport wasn't my best experience.  1st car I loaded into was missing key fob so I got error message when I pushed start button. Unloaded and loaded into 2nd car and the stench of cigarettes was too much. Unloaded and lifted hatchback on 3rd car to find the rear deck cover off it's track and blocking the cargo compartment. The staging lot was nearly empty. I approached a representative and was quickly directed to a satisfactory car.  Of course, by then, the bulk of customers on my shuttle bus had gotten their cars and clogged the exit booth lines. The booth attendant had already been informed of my delay, relaying to me there would be no fuel charges for my inconvenience. Much appreciated. I've rented 20+ cars over 4 years with this being my toughest experience. The staff on duty served the large surge of customers well and within minutes had tagged the bad cars, with fresh cars being driven in to re-fill the lot. I will continue to use National.<//Text>

First experience renting from National. I was in Sacramento for business and usually go through another company. I was fortunate to work with Safa. The entire process was pleasant thanks to his outstanding service and kind disposition. He educated me on the many benefits of National and because of Safa, I have switched my loyalty program to National. I’ve already convinced my husband and colleagues who also travel often to do the same. The return process was also smooth with outstanding representatives to greet you. Thank you, Safa!< /Review>

Coming from someone who already has 75 rental days this year, National is by far the best place to rent a car. There is always a variety of cars to choose and the ability to pick your own is a definite plus. Check out is fast, typically less than 10 minutes and you're on your way!  Staff is friendly and accommodating. I will only rent from National.</Text>

We switched and checked out, I asked the girls name, she told me April. April went above and beyond my expectations. Later I discovered I had left my IPad in the first car. I contacted National. They found my IPad for me, sent it to my home, and it was waiting on my porch when I arrived home. Also at no charge.

<review>Love the Emerald Aisle where you can pick your car. I dinged one star because the selection wasn't as good as it should be, but it did have a Chevy Silverado 4WD truck that was perfect for driving to South Lake Tahoe. Great prices. National is the only rental service I use. I highly recommend using them.<//review><pics>None< /pics><Time>1550254048508<//Time>< gmapID>

I love being able to walk directly out to the lot to select my vehicle (and NOT having to stand in line at the counter).  The folks at National are always super helpful, too.  What I do NOT like is that the selection of rental cars seems to be focusing almost exclusively on trucks and SUVs.  At my most recent visit to the Sacramento Airport facility, I was luck to find one sedan (and I really mean that there were absolutely no other vehicles available except for trucks and SUVs).  I consider this an issue, since I do not want to drive a truck or an SUV.  Hope National can increase their inventory of sedans.</review>

Smooth and easy. Every time I rent with National (normally 2-5 times a year) it's a great experience. The Emerald Aisle is so easy and user-friendly. You literally just walk straight off the plane and into the car of your choice from the National lot. That's it! No lines, no checking in, no one trying to up-sell you on insurance, no hassle at all. The staff are always amazingly courteous too.</Text>

Great experience and service at Sacramento airport. Emerald club experience was unique and I enjoyed the convenience of picking any car parked in the lane exclusively for Emerald club members. You walk in directly to the lane, pick any car (of course there won't be Mercedes or Porsche in that lane), drive to check out booth and boom, you are good to go. There was no pressure to buy liability coverage to my surprise. Overall very good first experience with National. I highly recommend.</text>

Getting a car for the weekend has never been easier. I choose "emerald Isle" everytime now. I walk right up to a car I want, get in and go. This last visit I took a car from the line and at the gate they told me I couldn't have it. It was a fully loaded SUV so I figure the lot porter just messed up. No biggy. They gave me a free tank of gas at check out for the trouble of circling the lot and getting a new car. Excellent customer service.<//Review>

I have never had a problem with any car rental since May of 2017.  I rent on a weekly basis.  The crew at Sacramento have been excellent.  I was running late to the airport and they actually drove me from the rental to the airport - that was unexpected.  One day it was raining and to my surprise, I was driven to the airport.  It was all unexpected and I was truly surprised and very appreciative of the service.  Without that over the top service, I would have missed my plane and not gotten home on time.  Thanks!</review>

Overall I find National Car Rental is the best car rental.  Lately their executive aisle selection has gotten much better, service is always professional and they have been responsive when there have been issues but nothing too major.  I look forward to continuing using National Car Rental for years to come!</Text>

< Review>
On a recent trip to Sacramento we arrived to find nothing suitable on the Executive aisle. The gal attending the lots learned of our need for a large vehicle and produced a minivan from the back of the lot that perfectly fit the bill, all the while being very professional about it. Good show!< /Review>

< Review>
We had a terrific, reliable Dodge Journey for our 3500 mile trip around the west.  My family visited 8 National Parks while camping at several locations, and our rental car travelled reliably up and down mountains, into canyons, across desserts, and through the great plains!   It was roomy for all of our luggage and camping equipment.  Picking up and dropping off the car was easy and quick.  I would definitely use National Car Rental next time I travel.<//Review>

I reserved a "Sporty" car for a trip my wife and I were taking up into the Sierra Nevada mountains.  It said "Dodge Challenger or equivalent" when I placed the reservation.  When we arrived and checked in at the Emerald Aisle they told us they would need to find a car for us, which took about 15-20 minutes.  When they finally brought the car up it was a Dodge Challenger, but it was the absolute lowest trim package available (V6 engine, cloth interior, etc.).  I guess perhaps it is my fault, as they gave me "what I reserved," but it seems a bit strange to reserve a "sporty" car that is slower, less well equipped, and just generally worse than a standard Nissan Altima...

I was very disappointed with National in this regard.  Next time I would tell them to take their "Challenger" back where they got it and I would select a normal car from the Emerald Aisle that would have been 10x better.<//text>

My National Car Rental was great. They always come through for me and I get a car I'm very happy with and I'm in and out very quickly. My only beef with the whole process is the Sacramento airport shuttle to the rental car facility.  The last four times I have showed up there have been 60 to 80 people waiting in line to board the shuttle bus.</review>

<Rating>3< /Rating><review>The process at National is fantastic and very easy.  Great for executive emerald club members.  The one consistent frustration I have, however trite it sounds, is almost every single time the windows are incredibly dirty.  Car just got washed or whatever and you can't at least dry the windows?  I can't see out of the side view mirrors because of hard water spots?  Come on.  How hard is this?  As good as the process is, this is one of those things that just drives you nuts every single time.  I'm in 8-9 rental locations in various cities, and almost always the same... just please wash the windows!<//review>< pics>

<Text>Returned a car here and the process seemed smooth. Arrived at 5am (yes morning) for a 7am flight out. The experience was okay. The agent greeted me by my name and gave me the receipt. No surprise charges (yay). The shuttle was packed and the line was 30 person deep. We understood the shuttle starts at 5am, so everyone who had an early flight was lined up. There were 3 buses to serve the car center. Wish they added more buses. Once a bus arrived, it was orderly and the bus driver actually efficient fit people in with their luggage. Thankfully the shuttle driver did provide order.</Text>< username>

My national experience at the Sacramento airport was seamless. I arrived at the rental car terminal and walked directly to the car area they did not have exactly what I reserved but they were able to find something comparable in seconds. My return was equally as easy allowing me to hop on the shuttle in a matter of minutes.<//text>

<review>My experience this trip with National, once again reminded me why they are my go to rental car company. Their customer service is always excellent starting with car pick-up until drop off. They always seem to have a good selection of cars. On those few occasions when they don't have exactly what I need, they make every effort to find it or accommodate me with something better. The important part is that I always leave happy. Even when my needs change and I need to trade the vehicle in for something different mid rental. They do so with a smile. This trip I needed to extend a rental  and it was a breeze through the National app. Overall great experience..... again. Thank you National.<//review><gmapID>0x809b2b0f343b8021:0xd344193333018566< /gmapID><Rating>5<//Rating>< Date>

<review>I travel to Sacramento often and nearly always use National Car Rental, so I was surprised when I checked out that my travel group had made reservations with a different rental company.  The check-out person said 'no problem' and proceeded to set me up in the chosen vehicle.  The only disappointment was the fact that they did not use the corporate account that I 'always' use and the rental rate was substantially higher.  They are friendly and efficient however next time I will not assume they will 'take care' of me if I had been booked in a different rental agency.<//review><pics>None</pics><Name>Gregg Lies<//Name><Response>{'time': 1481922514470, 'text': 'Hi, Gregg.

We had a brand new car (well, just over 2K miles on it) and it drove wonderfully. It didn't have a single dent and still had that new car smell.  It was a 2017 Chevy Impala.  Nice car. The service couldn't have been any better at National either. We were in and out within minutes with no hassles at all. We'll be using National next time as well.</review>

<review>I am a road warrior that travels 100%, yes every freaking week.
National is by my experience the best rental car company out there, and I have used them all over the years.
The staff is always great to help with any needs and being an Emerald member is very rewarding when you walk past the counter and see the other travelers waiting.
My favorite is the morning the car is due back, I receive an email that links directly with my GPS taking me directly back to their lot.
With all the highs and lows of travel, National is the one constant non hassle of each trip.

<Review>I never write online reviews for anything but I was compelled to after having such a good experience at this place. It was my first time renting a car, I'm 24 and my credit isn't the best. I just flew from NC to CA and my destination was 4 hours north of Sacremento..so getting a rental car was a life necessity that day. I had a reservation at another rental place but because of my bad credit they couldn't rent to me (understandable) So they sent me to National and things couldn't have gone smoother. Because of my age I was thinking I was going to have to cut my arm off to pay for a tiny compact car that I wouldn't feel comfortable driving. Instead, I ended up with a Dodge Challenger and ended up saving over $300. Eugene(?) I think was the name of the guy who helped me. He was great and really friendly.  Ended up taking the car back,  paid the price I was quoted and that was it. No surprise additional charges or anything like that. I will definitely use them anytime I need a rental.

Thanks again!</Review>< name>

Outside staff is friendly and helpful.  (did not interact with inside staff).

If you are Emerald Club, pick up is as easy as walking to get your car and driving out.  However, be quick as they may have only one exit open and you'll be stuck in a long line of cars to get out if you take too long choosing a car.</Review>

Recommend being an Emerald member; it's free and you can walk straight to the lot, pick a car, and get checked out quickly at the gate. Lot staff were extremely helpful, and return staff were patient. Great experience.<//Text>

<text>Moe could not have been more helpful at the National @ SMF. I was planning a trip for 6 and I had just missed out on an Infiniti QX80 which was in the Executive Isle and was going to settle for a Nissan Armada (equally as roomy but lacking in luxury).
Moe checked the inventory and 10 minutes later pulled up in an Inifinti QX80. When the rest of my road-trip party saw the vehicle, I am pretty sure they all created Emerald Club memberships then and there.<//text>< pics>

Previously I had sent a critical rate and review of the facility at Sacramento Airport. I had no problem with customer service, but rather with the limited selection of domestic vehicles. Since then, National has responded and has always had a reasonable selection of  GM domestic vehicles available. The employees continue to be friendly, courteous, and
efficient. Thanks for listening, National.<//text>

These guys really went above and beyond to help me.  I reserved a van and they let me know that a brand new Town & Country was just returned and they would go clean it and bring it to me or I can take an older model which was ready to go.  I waited and it was a great vehicle.  Terrific service.<//text>

After arriving at SMF and at National Executive Isle, there were no cars. Had to wait about 5 minutes. No choice except to take the next car brought up.  Not my usual experience with National and a bit disappointed. The car was OK with no problems.
Check in was a little before 5:00 AM. Just left the car and received receipt via email.<//review>

Using Emerald Aisle, great fast arrival, pick car and drive away.  I left my family to get the bags while I picked up the rental.  I pulled back up to the terminal just as they were walking out with the luggage.  As a car enthusiast, I wish they had more "interesting" cars to pick from, but it's just a rental.  Unlike my last two rentals from Budget, this was easy, the cars were in better shape, and they didn't run out of cars despite my reservation.  So National definitely wins.<//review>

< Review>
It was my first time renting through National, and I'm happy I signed up for the emerald club beforehand.  I was sent outside to choose the car I wanted (in the class I reserved) but was upgraded because they were all out of my class of car.  Renting and returning the car is quick and easy.  I hope the other National locations are as great as Sacramento.  If they are, they have my business for life.<//Review>

<Review>The Shuttle Experience taints the whole experience.

I brought this up with a representative once I reached the rental car center (after 25 minutes), and he said, "that's contracted out, I can report it," which means there's no way to improve the experience.

A half an hour to go a mile is silly, and the driver's unwillingness to load his tiny bus until the other was loaded even though there were a hundred passengers waiting, was dumb. Of course, piling luggage in the bus that would become projectiles in any accident is dumb too.  Whomever designed this experience should be re-assigned.

For a 20% fee from the various Sacramento taxing authorities, passengers deserve better, and National should push this point earnestly.< /Review>< rate>

I arrived a day early to pick up the truck and had to wait about 20 min for it to be refurbished for my use.  I was comped a tank of gas for my trouble and drove off on my trip.  As I use the emerald club process more and more I find it to be a very convenient and hassle free process and enjoy the personal service I receive each time.

<Review>So my car wasn't ready, they searched around and found a car, then brought a different car. There was a car like the one we reserved, but they couldn't find the keys. It was a very strange experience. I use national for all my work needs, this was the most odd experience I have had anywhere with them in 5 years of traveling. Not horrible, but not great.

The return/drop off was great, and so was the Tahoe.<//Review>< userid>

They seemed to have no idea what they were doing. I am supposed to be able to walk onto the lot, pick a car, drive up to the both and just quickly confirm my preferences and show my license...Yet this took probably 20 min. On the return I got a chip in the window, to fill out one small piece of paper for my insurance to take care of it took over 45 minutes. I am switching to Hertz or Avis after this experience.< /text>

As an Emerald Aisle customer, the number of available cars was limited, but I was immediately told to select from any car on the lot.  The way I am always treated is the reason why I have been a satisfied National customer for 20 years.</Text>

I always rent with National. As an Ermerald Club member, I find cars are always available, courteous staff and easy pickup and return. I recently had an unexpected flat tire in Albuquerque and the National staff made it extremely easy to return the car with the flat tire and drive off with a new car in very short order. Find customer service is always excellent with National</Review>

Not at all happy with the service - the person at the SMF National rental car was rude and very disrespectful. This happened for few weeks. Also there are cars that are kept that are over 10K miles and then when pick up that car and go to the exit kiosk  they would have us get out of the car and ask us to get a different car.< /Text>

<Text>Due to flight cancellations and delays, I was EXTRA late finally arriving at the Emerald Aisle for my car.    The pleasant man still manning the booth told me I was his last customer, and although he was supposed to have been off at midnight, he stayed until I arrived at 1am to be sure I got my car.  After the day of travel I had, it was refreshing to be greeted so pleasantly and to have a car ready and waiting to hit the road for the next leg of my journey!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Nothing easier than getting off the rental car shuttle bus, passing all the other people standing in line at the other companies' service desks, and picking out a car.  Then the exit was also easy, with National pretty much having the paperwork all ready according to my stored preferences.   Not real crazy about the car I chose, but that is just me.  I would advise leaving plenty of time upon return to  the airport, because the line to get on the shuttle to the terminal was quite long, and the trip takes a little time.  But that is not National's fault.<//text>

Pick your car, scan app to speed up your departure are nice features. All for nothing. Getting out of the lot was a joke. I sat in a 40 min line to get through 1 check out gate where 2 gates were available but only 1 operational. Get organized! Drop off was a snap.</review>

< Review>
I will start off saying my flight was delayed about 1 hour. However, I don't think that that was a big impact on my experience.

When I arrived, there were no vehicles available. There were about 10-15 people waiting to get a vehicle. As vehicles were brought out, the person at the front of the line was offered that one, and if declined, it was offered to the next. So, there was a very limited choice. It took me about 30 mins before I got an SUV or minivan (after turning down a small car that would not have held my luggage and an extra person or two).

When checking out, I asked about the line, and was told it had been that way since mid morning (I got there about 2:00pm), thus, I don't think it was my flight delay that caused this problem.

This seems to be a common problem across multiple National Car rentals at airports.< /Review>

I have been an Emerald Club member for a few years now and generally always have a positive experience with my car rentals.  My last three rental experiences however have been disappointing in that I had to wait for a car (there were only SUVs/Vans in the lot) and when additional cars were brought to the lot, there were VERY limited car options.
I have always enjoyed the benefit of just walking to the lot, choosing a car and getting on my way.  These recent experiences, while not devastating, were not the same great experiences I have had previously.<//review>

Not good this time but will give them another chance. The car that I rented from them was said to be returned in another state on a different day. This charged my bank account over $1000.00 dollars. I found this out on the last day of my vacation with my wife and we had to cut off our vacation early to get to the National rent a car center because they could not fix the situation over the phone. So we went in and the people were very helpful and offered me $100.00 credit. This was helpful but now they owed me over $1000.00 and i was three days before I got that money back into my account. Everything was on pause because of this and it was not good.</review>

<Text>Always a great experience as a member of the Emerald Club to bypass the lines and go directly to the aisle to pick a car.  I have rented a car at the Sacramento Airport a few times and the luxury of the cars available varies from time to time, but there is always at least one that catches my eye and serves me well.  Good to pay for a smaller car and get the next size or two larger.  Returned the car at 5:15 am Sunday morning and was confused about what I needed to do since there was no signage or attendant present.  Had to leave the car in the line of returned cars to make my flight. Worked out though as I received a receipt via email later that morning.  Good to learn I wasn't charged for something that might have happened to the car after I left it like a dented fender.  Overall a great experience.</Text><user>115599374089727591667</user>< Rating>

<Text>I had joined the emerald club, which was the best decision I had made.  It was as easy as walking to a car and driving it out.  The only complaint I had was they had charged my credit card for 2 gallons of fuel, even though I had filled up at the airport.  After calling the customer service they reversed the charges.  Was not happy about that.  Other than that it was a good experience.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

A very efficient and quick rental!  Emerald aisle makes business travel a breeze and renting a car extremely easy and never an issue.  Arriving after hours is also handled well.  Would always rent from National at this airport.  Shuttle buses (which are not National's responsibility, but the airport) can be few and far between so give extra time getting back to the airport or picking up the car.</Review>

<Text>Great service. No wait. I was sweating coming back to the airport that I may miss my flight due to traffic, but it tool me less than a min to get to the shuttle, as there was no delay in receiving the car.
Minor detailed cleaning needed. I do have to say the car was not super clean inside. Felt normal but not new.</Text><Gmap_id>0x809b2b0f343b8021:0xd344193333018566<//Gmap_id>< name>

<review>Went to go do paperwork for my reservation and was very unhappy. I have only rented a car once before so I am unfamiliar with the process. The counter guy asked if I wanted basic or full collision insurance. My company carries full rental car insurance for us but since I didn't know the rules of the state I was in I ask if those are the only two choices as I already have insurance. He states yes either basic or full. I say basic and he swipes my card and asks me to sign the and initial the rental agreement. I read it over and it says I accept optional basic insurance and there was a second line for optional roadside assistance for a charge I also wasn't asked about on the bill. I state to him he said there was no option for insurance and it says optional here. He rudely takes it off has me sign the new paperwork and sends me on my way. Good job lying to try to make an extra sale.<//review>< Pics>

Had an issue with the Tahoe SUV from San Francisco. Stopped at National Sacramento and all they had were a few midsize cars on the lot. One of the guys cleaning the cars came up and said he'd go find an SUV for us. I saw him hustle to the returned car lot. Then 20 minutes later I see a silver Tahoe pull out, getting vacuumed and ran through the car wash.  He then parks it where we are waiting. Wish I had tipped the guy.  Talk about outstanding service. Nadine and her crew were great too with handling the paperwork. National Car Sacramento rocks!</Text>

I got a great car, brand new, however when I picked it up the tank was empty and I had prepaid the gas.  I didn't notice until I hit the road so I thought it was going to be a problem when I returned the car because I had no proof, but the national staff trusted me and just asked what they needed to do to make it right for me, so they credited me the fuel service charge.  Very pleased with my rental overall and the service from National!</review>

<Review>National Rental did not seem to want my business when I landed in Sacramento. They were not helpful in telling me what car to take. I was told to go to the kiosk but no one was available to help there. This was my first time renting and I was shrugged off when I asked for help. The woman pointed me to a row of cars and then went back to help someone else that arrived after me. I found there were no empty cars in the row so I went back and again she waived me off. When I finally found an empty car, I wasn't sure how to start it since I had never used a keyless car. It took a decent amount of time to find someone to help. He was more help than the lady.

I reserved a mid size SUV for a leisure drive through North CA.  They had a brand new full size SUV on the lot for the same price.  I am a emerald isle participant.  Very nice rental without any hassle.  Will definately use again!

Thanks National.<//Review>

Been going to this Airport rental center since it was new and it is convenient and fast. The only downside is the same as any other off airport car rental is the bus ride, but this one is pretty short and usually is not terrible.</Review>

Trouble checking in with an Internal Credit Card from my company.  Agent told me to talk to the manager. Manager stated, "We have updated our system and the internal billing card was not excepted!" I showed  him the number of rentals I had this year and I said the only place I had problems was at the San Antonio and Sacramento sites.

Manager, " I need a personal credit card, and I will also need to see you airline reservations." I ask what does the airline reservations have to do with my National reservations? He stated that in case I would not return without checking out they would know when I would leave Sacramento!! Never had I ever been ask for flight reservations.  The office cleared all misunderstandings especially since the manger was WRONG!

I arrived at the hotel after midnight and had to prepare for my business meeting next day at 8:00 am.

I would not give ONE star, however the system you are using does not allow for feedback without a star.</Review>

<Text>I usually end up with Budget.  I don't know why but this time our travel contractor selected National.  I never saw any paper or signed anything.  I walked out to the lot, picked a car and drove to the exit where my credit card and drivers license were checked and out the gate I went.
Coming back was just as easy.  I drove up the the return area.  Grabbed my luggage, accepted my receipt, then walked to the shuttle pick-up area for a short ride to the gates.
I will suggest to the travel contractor that they select National for me every time and get it set up on my preferences.
Thank You National< /Text>< Pics>

First time I've rented from National, but they are now my go-to company. Outstanding service both at pick up and drop off. Great rate on the car, and they don't try to come back to you days or weeks later claiming damage to the car like Enterprise.< /review>

<text>This was my first time using National and it was definitely the most pain-free experience in renting a car that I have ever had. I bypassed the counter lines and wait and walked straight to my car on the Emerald Club row drove it to the kiosk and they already new my name and I was on my way in less then 3 minutes total.

<Review>Not to sound like the commercial, but renting from National at Sacto Airport saves me a LOT of time and hassle.  Walk up, take car, go.  No standing in lines.  No forms.  There is always a good selection of cars in great shape.  Returns are even faster.  National prices are higher than some other companies, but not that much.  If  you value your time at more than $5 an hour, you are ahead.  Not to mention the lack of stress and hassle while you are traveling.</Review></record></dataset><record>

We had a good experience picking up our car, and were pleased with the vehicle during the time we had it. I've generally had a good experience with National, but upon returning the vehicle, we had a less than positive experience. I'm an Emerald Club member and the rental was in my name, but my other driver (not an EC member) returned the car while we checked baggage, as we were on a tighter timeline. Another EC member was allowed to drive the rental up to the terminal and unload, with a National employee driving it back. But because he himself wasn't an EC member (although the reservation was mine), he wasn't allowed to do so. It was frustrating, but overall thankfully not typical of my experience with National.<//Review>

<text>The car was in great condition and worked well. However, there was no way to get the bill from going to my corporate card when this was a personal rental.  I called and was told this was not possible. It was quite disappointing to not be able to switch cards as needed.  It automatically went to the card on file and there was no one on site to be able to change this for me when I picked it up. I was just directed to a lot to pick my car.</text><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1505944796115, 'text': "We're listening and would like to know more, Danielle Raub.

Pretty disappointed with National Car Rental in Sacramento.  Rented cars there a half dozen times in the last few months.  Then a couple weeks ago I reserved a car for under $45 total.  When I returned the car, the clerk said his receipt machine wasn't working, so they emailed it to me.  30 minutes later I saw that I was charged $129 for a car I used for 3 hours and put 40 miles on.  I called National's customer service line, and the lady told me she would contact the Sacramento branch and see what they could do about it, and would call me back.  She never called me.  I called again and spoke with a man, who told me he was setting up a call-back and that someone would call me from National in the next three business days.  It never happened.  I've been various levels of membership, including Executive Elite.  National has LOST MY BUSINESS as of right now, and I'll make sure everyone I know is aware of their poor customer care as well.</text>

My flight got rerouted due to a snow snow and I didn't get into Sacramento until 1:30 AM. They normally close at midnight but the night manager stayed and made sure we could pick up our car. I will always use National from now on after this great experience.<//Text>

<Review>National always has a car that I want available.  Customer service is great.  Never a surprise on the bill.  I’ve had bad experiences with other rental car companies. Quote a rate on the phone and when I turned in the car, much higher!
National is competively priced.  Always a good experience.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Name>Casey Spletter<//Name><review>Such a disappointing experience. I made an online reservation using my corporate rate. When I went to pick-up the car, I had to stop at the counter to add my traveling partner as an additional driver (something that was no additional charge under my corporate contract). However, the guy behind the counter told me the rate, which was more than double what it should have been. I explained that rate is not correct and he just stared at me and said that is what his computer is telling him, so that's the rate. I pulled up my confirmation e-mail, told him what my corporate code was and he did nothing to be accommodating. The whole time he just sat behind the desk and offered no help whatsoever. After about 10 minutes of me trying to come up with a solution, I finally decided to just pay the outrageous rate because I needed the car and I was getting really frustrated. So disappointing because I've used National many times in the past- all of those times I'd go right to the Emerald Aisle with no problems. However, the one time I need a National rep's help, it goes badly. Just be warned if you're looking for help from a National agent, you will not get it. It really did put a sour taste in my mouth the whole trip because I felt I was taken advantage of- he knew I needed the car, so there wasn't anything I could do without his help. I ended up paying more than double what I should have paid and it made me sick to my stomach.  I've been in customer service before and that is NOT how you treat your guests.</review>< date>

The National rental place was quite far away from the main terminals. We had to take a bus to reach there. But the bus/shuttle service is pretty good and a shuttle arrives every fifteen minutes or so. Anyway, we reached the rental car place and it's a big parking lot and a small building with all the car rental company’s in the same location. We had reservation with National so we went there. Safa was very nice and courteous. He recommended the right stuff and gave us the right advice. We asked for a GPS and he gave us option to have the physical GPS device or he could put us in a 2018 Chevy suburban for lil bit more with Built-in navigation and more cargo space and we went with that one. There is a gas station at the entrance of the airport area, but he offered us to prepay the tank if we using the FULL tank which was one of the best decisions I made since we were already late for our flight back and no need to stop by gasstation and waste time. the return process was Swift and pain free. Overall good experience<//review>

I use exclusively for travel.  The emerald club is the best thing out there.

I have rented over 100 cars from National and have only not had a good rental once

I do wish they carried some more american cars in the executive rows.

The rental experience was very hassle free. Walk out get in a car and leave. Unfortunately I returned the car early in the morning before you were open and was not able to get a receipt. I requested a receipt be e-mail ed and left my information on the return card I filled out with the mileage and fuel info and left it in your drop box. I am in need of 2 receipts. Both in sacranento. One for the week of May 9 and the week of May 16.<//Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>As an Executive Elite member I frequently use National for business trips; however, after my experience at the SMF airport location, I most likely will be taking my business elsewhere. They would not accept my corporate travel card because the name didn't EXACTLY match the name on my drivers license. So I used my debit card and it took approximately 15 minutes to verify my travel itinerary as part of their debit card policy. I normally fill up before I return the vehicle; however the rental attendant told me that their gas is the lowest price around and that if I bought a full tank up front, I would save me money if I brought the vehicle in at a half tank or below. As I left I started to crunch the numbers (tank capacity, $/gallon around town, $/tank from National) and realized I would have had to bring the vehicle in with 1 gallon of gas remaining to break even on their so called money saver deal. Normally I don't get rooked but on this occasion I did. I thought being Executive Elite meant something. Just goes to show there is no point in being loyal to any 1 rental company. Lesson learned.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<time>1481766986599</time><text>Overall it was fine.  When I went to the lot only to find just two cars were available - a Monster Suburban or a Cadillac sedan, not the Chevy Malibu I reserved.  I was told to take either one.  I'll never turn down a Caddy at a Chevy price but it was strange not to have more cars available on a Wednesday afternoon.  One thing rental car companies need to consider - cars like that Caddy have far too complicated control systems for a short-term rental.  I was still working out how to work out the climate, radio, entertainment system after 4 days behind the wheel.  It puts drivers in unsafe situation as we struggle with steep learning curve.<//text>< username>

<Text>Normally no problems with National - This time was different. When I got to the lot I had a choice of a Jeep Patriot or a Ford work van, nothing else on the lot. I took the Jeep. What a piece of junk, auxiliary power did not work, it felt like two squirrels were under the hood for power. I will never choose one again, even if I have to go to another rental company.</Text></record>

Everytime I rent a car it seems the inside of the windshield was wiped down with a greasy rag. The glare that this creates in the rain and at night is very dangerous. As well this latest rental car clearly had no smoking signs in it but it smelled badly of smoke. I am considering changing to and competitor to receive proper and clean cars<//text>

<text>I always rent from National thru Emerald Aisle.  But the Sacramento Airport supply for Emerald is weak at best.  Their cars are more like mid size or basic full size.  I have rented there twice in 2 months and the cars they have in the "Aisle" have not been up to Emerald Aisle standards.  If National wants us to pay premium prices for Full Size to get to Aisle, they need to upgrade the cars at SMF.  I rent all the time from National and this is not normal.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Over and above. I arrived back at the airport with a great deal more to travel with than I came. I asked if someone could help me carry something to the front of the building to catch the bus. Instead, Stephen drove me to the terminal to check in at curb side. Thank you for going over and above.< /Review>

<review>Trip to Sacramento, CA. It was during a heat wave of 110+ degrees. Staff went out of there way to make sure all customers were taken care of and squared away. I had a hiccup with my reservation (my bad actually), but the manager stepped right in and took care of the issue. Very proactive management. I was back on the road in 10 minutes! And that's why I've been a National Car customer for 15 years.</review>< pics>

I've rented from National for years and the service, cars and rates are always top notch! Every once in a while I'll try out another rental company and always leave disappointed. National car is a top notch company and will always point friends and relatives to them.</review>

< review>
My husband booked a car for us originally. My 5 year old son and I flew to Sacramento. When I went to pick up the rental I was denied because my name was on the rental but my husbands name was on the credit card. When I tried to tell them I’m an authorized user I was still denied. Then I explained that I had a debit card in my name and I was denied. So there I am in Sacramento, with a 5 year old, at 8 pm and they won’t let me get a vehicle.  Also, no one tried to really help me resolve the situation. Finally, after about 20 minutes and getting frustrated , a manager walks out and proceeds to tell me the only way for me to get a vehicle is for my husband to go online and go to Priceline to prepay a car. So my husband did, using MY DEBIT CARD that National just said they couldn’t accept!!!!! So when they pull up the Priceline reservation and ask me for the card I’m going to pay with , they then accepted the same darn card they just refused to accept. Sheesh. So finally after about 30 minutes I get the rental. The car was great, and the return was super easy but the actual picking up SUCKED.<//review>

but their customer service really need to upgrade their knowledge about national. National recently partnered with Plenti for rewards program. but no one had any clue at this location what plenti card is. what to do with card. hence two star less.

I like national car and i will continue to rent from them. it will be nice if their employees knew about national product better.<//text>< pics>

Easy in and out.  If they are short on cars just wait few minutes and one will appear freshly washed.  Only detractor is sometimes the wait for the rent car bus at the airport is too long, but nothing like PHX.<//review>

Was overcharged by about double for my last rental. Wasn't given a receipt as I left the lot.   Realized the error about an hour after leaving and called for assistance.  Customer service seemed to have no authority.  Called back and after escalating the matter finally got to the bottom of the problem.  For some inexplicable reason, it takes DAYS to get a refund, even though their initial charge is instantaneous.  National seems to have little interest in my experience there, although I am an Emerald Club member and rent from them frequently.  They should have credited the entire rental, considering the problem that the error caused.  It was disappointing to me that my continued loyalty to their brand meant nothing and that their error was something I was just "stuck" with.<//Text>

<review>I love that National lets me pick my car and I walk straight to the parking lot, however, this time I found extra charges on my bill that I had not signed up for for Sirius XM radio for 5.99/day that I did not request and I sent an email asking for an update last Friday and it's Tuesday and I still haven't received a response.  This is frustrating.<//review><gmapID>0x809b2b0f343b8021:0xd344193333018566<//gmapID>< response>

The staff was welcoming, helpful, and kind. The cars available were limited, but I got what I needed. I appreciate having XM radio in the vehicles as well. My only request is to make National reservations in Sacramento airport an option in our corporate travel system, Egencia. Today, AVIS and Hertz are the two options available. I go to the National counter when I get there. So far, I've been lucky and they've had cars available for me to take. National is an approved vendor with our company, so I can make reservations through our system for other National car rental locations.</text>

<review>I was running late for my flight and National's rep drove me straight to the terminal -- much faster than the shuttle! Great service, good car selection, too (lots of Nissans with quick bluetooth connecting)! I rent from National only!</review><user>103709301445783106933<//user><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

The vehicle choices and customer service at the Sacramento Airport has exceeded my expectations on the 9 rentals at 115 days already this year. I give (5) stars for this location. However I just returned from Salt Lake City and they do things a lot differently there. You do not get to select your vehicle regardless of your tier status and they only provide Chevrolet model vehicles. I used my free days I've acquired this year to rent a car while I was in SLC to secure housing for my relocation to the area. I was extremely disappointed in the with the car I was provided with. Their customer service at the rental counter in the parking garage where one would need to wait in line to be issued a car was sub par at best. For this National Rental Car location I give (1) star and recommend an alternate.<//text>

<Text>A moderate amount of vehicles to select from.  It is a small lot so it can get jammed up with cars quick but they process as quick as they can.  I left my jacket in the rental car one time and they worked with me to get it back to me.  Oh sure I had to pay to get the jacket shipped to me but hey, i'm the one that left it in the back seat, wasn't their fault I'm absent minded....<//Text></record></dataset><record>

All my luggage was in my rental car when I got locked out of it while refueling.   It was 5 AM in the morning.  An enterprise representative, Talhar,  was at the gas station and offered to help me.  When it looked like there wouldn't be time before my flight to get the car unlocked, he drove me to the airport and offered to help however he could.  He reported matters to his supervisor and she referred it to National Lost and Found.  Allan of the Lost and Found took it from there and helped me both with getting the report in and in completing the claim form when I had trouble with the website.  All of them were stellar in their graciousness and eagerness to help.  Colene Lee</Text>

<review>Picked up car at Sacramento Municipal Airport (SMF).  Slight scratches detected on rear bumper below trunk edge.  Reported this to National attendant.  He said it was from other drivers loading luggage into trunk.  I reported it to woman at the check out window and she came out of booth and photographed it and noted it on my rental agreement so I would not be charged for damage later. My only dissatisfaction is that the door mounted  rear view mirrors on both left and right doors had water spots from washing the car and were not wiped off.  This has happened many times with National and other rental agencies.  I stopped at gas station and got the mirrors cleaned off.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><GmapID>0x809b2b0f343b8021:0xd344193333018566< /GmapID>< name>

<time>1505420856671< /time><Rating>2<//Rating><review>I reserved my 12 day suv rental a month in advanced paid in full with no refunds. Once arrived, I printed the ticket and went on to the parking where my suv was going to be picked up. Out in the parking I finally found an attendant advttendentnd he informed me that they are all out. What??? I prepaid for it 30 days in advanced with no refund. ..meaning their is no way back for me...and should be for them but they didn't contact their selves in it. They found an older 2012 SUV that was on the lot and I was on my way. That suv was dirty outside and inside. Later discovered that the chargers where burned out and we could not charge our phones. One of the tires was low on air and SUV had lots of vibration going down the hwy. After 4 days and 1,600 miles, we arranged for a replacement in Sacramento which was a became a terrible experience. Read my review on Sacramento location. I will never rent from Alamo again. Enterprise will do.<//review>< pictures>

<text>1st time renting from National - I made errors with my booking - needed an SUV; booked a midsize car - lot staff at Sacramento airport sorted things out quickly and cheerfully - got me on my way in short time - and with a great SUV at a fair price.

Very poorly designed facility when there is any kind of rush hour to turn cars back in.  Waited for 30 minutes to get in the lot around 5:15 am in the morning.  Inexcusable!  Don't know if this is entirely National's fault, but when you are trying to make an early morning flight, it doesn't really matter.  This needs to be corrected.   Next time I'll just take Uber.< /Review>

<text>I rented a car in one location and returned it to another.  I have a written confirmation quote for the price, but when I returned it they charged me $34 a day more than my written quote.  That is not what really bothers me, what bothers me is that I filed a written complaint to their corporate almost 2 weeks ago, called 2 times for an update, and they have not returned my call or given me any updates.  It seems like there are management problems at both a branch level and at the corporate level.<//text>< Rate>

The waiting time for transportation from the airport to the rental site was horrible.  We had to wait through 4 buses until there was room (still extremely crowded) to go to the site.  When we got to the rental location, there was one car left.  It was a very basic VW with a transmission that at times didn't engage at low speeds.< /review>

walked to the counter, asked for best rate, she said only car is full size, I said I don't think I'll get a good deal with that as a passing thought, she shrugged her shoulders and said "ok" as if you say "ok, then get out of here"</Text>

<Text>My experience with this rental was as follows:
Selection of automobiles in the Emerald Aisle was somewhat limited.
The inside of the windshield was so filthy that it was difficult to see at night.
A warning light indicated the vehicle was low on windshield washer solution.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>I have used many of the car rental companies over the past few years, National is always my first choice.  Their business model is friendly to the business customer, and the time I have saved with National is well into days.  Only one suggestion, I guess all companies use the same carwash,  because all rental cars have annoying spots on the mirrors and windshield, I suggest a wiping them down before the water dries.</text><rating>5</rating><username>John CMR< /username>< gmapID>

<Review>Use National most of the time though they can be more expensive than some of the discount car rentals.  Like that I can walk past the counter and pick any car on the lot.  have not had great success with XM radio option.  Twice advance requested and could not get it to work in the car.</Review>< user>

Had a reservation...joined the emerald club. ...picked up my car... swiped my credit card...drove ....returned the car....took the bus back to the terminal. All  in cost me $29 for a Nissan Murano  for 2 days. Steal of a deal.

The only issue which was a non-issue was when I pulled away I noticed the tank was half full. I  took a picture with my phone and when I checked in let the agent know about the fuel situation. She asked if I had a photo or called them, showed the photo she said OK and noted it on the file.<//Text>

I rented a car last week in Sacramento.  When I turned it back in they told me they were having technical problems and I would receive my receipt within 24 hours via e-mail.  It's now been almost 4 days and still no receipt.</Review>
