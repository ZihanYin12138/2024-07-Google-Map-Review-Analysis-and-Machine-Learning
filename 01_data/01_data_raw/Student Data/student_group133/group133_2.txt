< Review>
Unfortunately I’ve had to go 3 different orthopedic doctors in the last 2 years. Hands down this place is by far the best. Dr. Yuri Falkenstein and the rest of the team are extremely nice and very professional. He spent time explaining me my injuries as well as delivering excellent news other doctors couldn’t deliver. Although my back has terrible pain everyday I was relieved to hear that it is still a healthy back. I was immediately referred to another specialist at OS of Burbank and I am looking forward to finally moving forward and pushing through my injury but more importantly my life!! Some other doctors tend to quickly look at you, write some notes down and in 5 minutes or less they have assessed you and then we go on with our day. Not Dr. Falkenstein. Thank you again so much for the dignity, diligence and advice!</Review>

I didn’t have to wait very long to get an appointment as I would have for other doctors. To my surprise this was a very busy doctors office.  However, it is very efficient, organized, and professional. Patient forms were sent in advance so I was able to complete them comfortably and adequately. Moreover, in this time of Covid-19 they have taken excellent precautions to ensure that patients, doctors, and staff are safe.  Dr. Raven is very professional and thorough. Within an hour I had an x-ray, ultrasound, and the necessary next steps to scheduling surgery.</Review>

From the beginning the receptionist was very engaging and pleasant. When my name was called and taken to the examination room I never felt in the dark. I was always told what would be happening and why. The x-ray technician was efficient. Dr. Raven explained everything and told me my treatment options. I have been going for 14 years now for various problems. I always leave feeling better and knowledgeable about my condition and how to care for myself. Furthermore I wouldn’t hesitate to follow up with questions I may have down the line.

I was recommended to the OSS team by a friend who’s husband and her self both had surgeries with the Yacobian brothers.  I was very pleased with their knowledge and expertise regarding my health issues.
They listen and take time to make you feel comfortable and let you know what’s going on with your symptoms.
I’ve seen 3 of the 5 doctors and feel very confident in trusting them completely.  I’m so great full for my experience!

Thank you OSS surgeons and the OSS Hand and therapy  Elite team.
I’m on the road to recovery!

When he actually had the surgery Dr Yacoubian and his staff went out of their way to make sure that I was just as comfortable and checked on me regularly.  So when I broke my foot recently and my doctor wanted to refer me to an orthopedic I didn’t hesitate and asked to be referred here. Again, the staff is amazing. From the time you walk in the door to all the assistants and the PA that treated me Omar was great.  Answered all my questions and explained everything perfectly!!!  Always feel very well taken care of here!!!< /Review>< Pics>

Dr. Shahan Yacoubian and his office staff really go the extra mile. Dr. Yacoubian followed up with me in person twice on the day of my surgery and called me the next day. The office provides a way for you to communicate with questions, even on the weekend. Everyone is nice and, unlike a previous doctor I considered, the wait time in the office is either right on time or wait (maybe) ten minutes. I've been really happy with the care I've gotten and I'm healing up great. Two weeks after surgery and I'm up and moving with very little pain!</text>

<Review>I’m thrilled to return as a patient of Dr. Stephan Yacoubian for my upcoming knee arthroscopy surgery. He performed surgery for my other knee over 10 years ago and gave me excellent care. His expertise and experience gives me peace of mind but just as important he takes the time during my appointment to answer any questions I have. His office staff is professional and top notch as well.< /Review><date>1599251897468</date>< username>

I’ve been here a couple years ago, for my knee and had a great experience. This time around, I saw Dr. Raven for my hand injury, and had a great experience with him. He reassured me my injury was very common and made sure I was taken care of. I would recommend coming here for your orthopedic needs.</review>

<Text>Orthopedic Surgery Specialist to the stars, and Hollywood’s best kept secret:
I was referred In 2004 by an old stunt man from Warner Bros as well as actors from NBC Television as I was 49 years old and after decades of being a professional dancer and countless years as a waiter    with multiple knee injuries, ended unable to walk. They injected SYNVISC into both knees I took their recommended physical therapy and returned to fully recovered still to this day at 65 years old. And today in 2020 had SYNVISC injected in both shoulders and the pain is completely gone and mobility is beginning to return. Not everything requires a surgeon. I am grateful for the advanced medicine. And because I’m still going 65 in age and speed i was so happy to hear that Medicare pick up the tab at 100%! I am a very happy baby boomer right now! If you have shoulder pain or knees or any joint pain or difficulty standing or sitting or walking please make an appointment today to learn whats new in our space age menu of modern remedies. This not our parents Orthopedic’s anymore.
“May the force be with you”’and “Live long and prosper" I promise you will in-fact be better after your first visit.< /Text>< UserId.>

They were always on time with the appointment schedule. The support staff is kind and efficient. And the doctors... Well they are very good at what they do and have a great bedside manner. My wife and I have been patients for many years now and have always felt better coming out than when we entered, even if they had done nothing medically. They explained everything so you were never in the dark. I go to them for my orthopedic needs, no question.

< Review>
I’ve seen Dr Stephan Yacoubian for several different injuries. He performed my surgery to fix a torn rotator cuff in the past and that was the quickest I’ve ever recovered from any surgery (and I’ve had many.).  This time around I’m seeing him for my knee, where he’s going to try a gel injection and physical therapy.  I love that he doesn’t jump straight into surgery - he starts off small and works his up from there if need be. Dr Stephan is an excellent physician and is very kind, compassionate, and empathetic.   His office staff is wonderful as well. The physical appearance of his office is clean, warm, and inviting. An added bonus - he helps out his community and travels to other places and helps out there as well.  I’ve recommend Dr. Stephan to several family members and they’ve been more than happy with their results. I wouldn’t want to see any other orthopedic surgeon!  Thank you Dr. Stephan - you are truly the best out there!<//Review>

<text>All the staffs were very helpful, compassionate, and professional. Very short waiting time, which is important esp when you have pain. Honestly, the most compassionate care i’ve got so far.

Update
-All of the staffs were super friendly but I had to go a long tough route because of the physician Assistant’s wrong diagnosis. He said my back pain was js from muscle spasm and gave me steroid shots with pills which didn’t work for me at all. And it turned out to be disc herniation with sciatica from another clinic.</text><user_id>109277652093145260430< /user_id>< rate>

From the beginning, at front desk was friendly and organized. The staff is professional and does great job setting up the trays for the physician.  Glad for Dr Beatons referral.  Dr Mark M. Was thorough and gave good patient assessment and answered questions. Made patient feel that they are being taken care of.< /text>

Two years since I had both knees replaced and all is good! I believe I left a very positive review not long after, so this is basically a repeat of that. Dr Shahan Yacoubian does the knee replacements, and he knows what he is doing.  His staff is great too and their physical therapy center next door is top notch! They were great! Didn't push too hard to cause pain but pushed enough to get my strength and range of motion back, actually better than before, and I was about as un-limber as someone can get!</review>

Very courteous, competent personnel and medical staff.

I consulted with Dr Mark Mikhael for my ankle, and Dr Shahan Yacoubian for a knee problem. They listened patiently and gave me full attention. I asked questions to my heart’s content, and they answered them clearly.  I understood their explanations, and I came out with a positive mindset. I’ve already started implementing their recommendations

I trust the doctors at OSS because personal experience. Over the years, I’ve had several encounters, including five successful surgeries that restored full function.< /review>

<review>I trust this facility with my heart. Two years ago, when my child injured his ankle on a Saturday, this is the only doctor office was open and treated my child. My child injured his left 5th toe this past Sunday, we got the x ray from an Urgent  care, and was told there was no fracture. But my instinct told me I should seek second opinion. The doctor here pointed out the fracture right away from the image and took care of my child again. Thanks doctors for what you do!<//review>< user_id>

<review>I was referred to OSS after fracturing my wrist. Omar,  the PA I saw, told me what my options were, which  one he would choose, and why.  A lidocaine  injection ( not fun ), 10 minutes in a medieval hand- stretching device, and a few manipulations later (even less fun than the injection),I was casted, x- rayed, given a follow-up appointment,  and out. Everyone was professional and personable.  Xray showed the bone was right back where it was supposed to be.   Keeping it all crossed for quick recovery!< /review><user>104199033128547708526< /user>< GmapID>

I usually don’t write reviews but I had such a pleasant experience today as a new patient. From the time I was greeted with the front desk clerk to the Medical Assistant and Dr. Mark Michael took time to explain and make sure that I understood everything that was said
I would highly recommend this doctors office to my family and friends

Everyone there knows their post and handles patients with efficiency and a smile. They are always on time...so nice! I always feel that I am in the best of hands while being seen and treated there. I highly recommend them!

< review>
I was referred to visit Dr. S. Yacoubian for a possible right knee injury by my primary doctor.

I called the office and spoke with the receptionist who was very/super friendly. She gave me a appointment without any issues. "5 's"

Prior to my appointment, I was emailed all the forms to fill out as a new patient and bring it with me the day of my appointment. What an amazing idea! I wish all doctor offices would do this. "5 's"

I arrived to my appointment and was help by the receptionist immediately. Once my paperwork and co-pay was completed, I waited 5 minutes and was called in. "5 's"

I met with Dr. Yacoubian who was very professional, caring and knowledgeable. I'm so glad I was referred to this office. I will always come here if needed and I recommend everyone to give them a chance. The office and patient rooms were clean and neat.</review>

<userid>116285758006823061016< /userid><Review>Dr. Yuri Falkinstein saved me! I honestly don’t even know how to describe the happiness and relief I am feeling right now after suffering from lower back pain for pretty much half of my life (p.s I am 30 years old).
Since my teenage years, I suffered from sciatica. I had been under years of chiropractic care and physical therapy but I continuously got worse. It took one sneeze and I was unable to walk, sit, stand or lay for about 2-3 weeks. I was terrified and upset that THAT had become my reality and I couldn’t continue living like that.
When Dr. Falkinstein saw my MRI’s, he carefully and thoroughly explained the condition my spine was in and why surgery would be the only and appropriate solution. My L5-S1 was bone to bone with Grade 2 slippage and severe impingement of my L5 nerve root. No amount of muscle relaxers, therapy, stretching or injections would aid my situation. I appreciate and trust Dr. Falkinsteins honesty and decision because he truly and genuinely cares for the well-being of his patients. He listens and explains everything so well.
My surgery took about 4 and a half hours and it was done through an anterior (from the front with a vascular surgeon) and a posterior (from the back) approach to completely stabilize my spine. Yes! So they flipped me during surgery (mind blown)! I walked the following day and  stayed 2 nights at the hospital. I was off pain meds a few days after I got home and every day everything got easier! Just remember to breathe and take it slow.
Thank You Dr. Falkinstein for giving me my quality of life back! I am so appreciative of you and I recommend anyone suffering from spinal pain to ONLY trust Dr. Yuri Falkinstein!< /Review>< time>

<text>Today I had my first appointment for a complaint of right shoulder pain and possible rotator cuff tear. Vaz, a certified P.A., was extremely professional and efficient in doing a right shoulder exam, and getting me an X-ray, ultra-sound and cortisone injection. Vaz set me up for an MRI next Tuesday, and a return visit on Friday in the office to evaluate the diagnostic testing. I was greatly impressed with the well organized and professional treatment I received from Vaz and the entire office staff.</text>< name>

Their rehab/physical therapy office is conveniently located  across the street. Appointment reminders are always sent to you a day or 2 in advance.

My experience with Dr. Raven was excellent. He diagnosed and treated my carpal tunnel syndrome with release surgery. Dr. Raven explained all the options to me well before the surgery and once we both agreed on it, I followed through with the procedure. My rehab was fine, with no problems and  very minimal scarring. As other reviewers have noted, Dr. Raven is very matter-of-fact. I didn't mind it, he is a proven orthopaedic surgeon, not a talk show host. He listened, but without the small talk. I would recommend him to anyone.<//review>

I have seen 3 of the doctors at this practice. Drs Yacoubian diagnosed my long time hip injury and repaired it orthoscopically, so I went home the same day with 1 stitch. Walking within a month pain free!

Dr Falkenstein repaired my spine, which had degenerated to the point of being an emergency! The VA only gave me PT exercises, but Dr Yuri saw the danger and urged immediate surgery to prevent me becoming paralyzed! I had great results. After healing and doing recovery PT, I am pain free almost every day.  I trust him so much, I sent my husband in for surgery with him as well! I know with my DDD there will be other surgeries in my future, but if Dr Yuri is performing them, I am not fearful. Dr Falkenstein is a wonder worker.

Recently seeing Dr Raven for a wrist injury. He had also successfully treated husband's trigger finger. He's straight forward and quick at finding problems.  His OSS Elite Hand PT group is amazing, stare of the art, kind, and have helped so many people improve function and quality of life.

The office crew here is also an amazing team, between scheduling, reception, insurance,  and in house xrays, all buzz about quickly and kindly caring for the patients. My longest wait was maybe 10 minutes before being seen!

Parking can be rough, but there is a large structure. Pay at machines at the lot entrance, cash or cards.</Text>

I had a consultation with Dr. Shahan Yacoubian last year in late July. He diagnosed my problem and told me I needed a hip replacement. I told him I was not ready to have it done at that time. He replied to let him know when I could not take the pain any longer which he said would be about a year. A year later to the week I could not take the pain and scheduled an appointment. He met with me and discussed the procedure and the surgery was scheduled within a week. I chose to go to the "surgery center" in Glendale which I highly recommend. I arrived at 6:30 am and "walked out" at 3:30 that afternoon. The staff at the surgery center was fantastic and actively took care of me post-surgery. Dr. Yacoubian gave me his cell # in case I needed anything and he called me several times to check in. What doctor does that in today's time?
I am 62 years old and have never been in a hospital, or had any sort of surgery. I cannot say enough good things about OSS, Dr. Yacoubian, Aimee Del Valle NP-C, Jessica Ojeda SurgeryCoordinator, and all the staff.
If you find yourself needing orthopedic surgery, please make the time to have a consultation with Dr. Yacoubian or any of the the other doctors at OSS.</review>

I took my mother her after a bad experience with a different doctor's office,
This office is very welcoming and helpful,  We saw Dr  Stephan he is very attentive and listens to all your concerns,  he explained everything clearly and ordered all tests the same day, my mother has a very complex condition and I have pure confidence in the doctor. Please if you want a doctor who cares ho to this office all doctors are amazing
Thank you very much

I visited Dr. Raven with a trigger finger on my right hand that was causing me problems. I was very pleased that he didn't insist on surgery right away, but gave my finger an injection with the caveat that it might not completely solve my problem. He was correct in that, while greatly improved, I still had problems with my finger. Again, Dr. Raven gave me an injection, this time saying I'd need surgery if this shot didn't do the trick. With both injections, he used a machine that let him see exactly where the needle was going and he gave them quickly and efficiently. I like that he is straight forward without being abrupt or insensitive and is easy to talk to. At the moment, if my finger continues as it is, I won't need surgery and that makes me very happy.< /review>

Want to thank Dr. Stephan Jacoubian for the wonderful job he did doing a total knee replacement on my left leg. Looking forward to having my right knee replacement done also. I got to see an X-ray of my new knee joint after surgery and everything was in perfect alignment. The way he closed the surgical site has only left a faint hairline scar. Everyone else I have seen that had this surgery elsewhere has a had wide 1/4 inch scar. It’s amazing the difference a surgeon makes. Fast efficient office. I am walking well without assistance. Highly recommend Dr. Stephan Jacoubian for your surgical needs.</Text>

My visit today was very efficient, fast and the results were perfect— the visit could not have been more professional. I was a nervous wreck when I arrived but I left the office relieved. I felt like OSS knew what was wrong and they cared!<//Review>

Have a knee injury so I made an appointment at OSS. When I arrived the waiting room 3/4 full but was seen by the receptionist  in short period of time. I was called into an examination room and was left there for 45 minutes. I was examined by I guess a physician's assistant and was taken to another area to have X-rays  taken. I waited only 10 minutes and then was seen by the physician's assistant again. He told me the X-rays were negative and that I should go have a mri taken. I led to another part of the office where I was given information of where to go for an mri. And that was it. I never did see a Dr. and was given zero instructions on what to do in the mean time. I'm suppose to see the Dr. again when the mri results will be available. I can't believe a Dr's office will tell you to come back in 11 days and provide with zero instructions. Luckily I obtained the info I needed from other heath care professionals.</Text>

I’m such a fan of OSS.  I am currently under the care of Dr. Falkinstein and the PT duo of Abby and Tatiana for a pinched nerve in my neck.  The gals at the PT location make me feel better every time I see them, and their suggested ‘at home’ work is clearly having a positive effect.
Today I saw Dr. Raven who had done  surgery on my right hand several years ago to address Dupuytren’s Contracture.  I started having similar symptoms  in my left hand several months ago.  Rather than rushing into a surgical solution, Dr. Raven was very straight forward about how surgery could compound the problem, and suggested I monitor the hand and make a decision when the discomfort is no longer tolerable
.
I so appreciate how the staff keeps appointments moving.  I have rarely had to wait more than a few minutes for any appointments.

I would suggest this group of specialists to anyone with a need for their services.< /Text>

I had surgery from a Dr at Cedars and SCOI.
These two Dr who I won’t mention both missed my ruptured disc at L2-L3.the first just played totally winks and the one at SCOI fussed L3-L4-L5.
All 3 surgerys left me in the hospital a week for each. After the 3rd one I was worse than before the first one and had to retire.
Dr Yari Falkinstein  scheduler  Barbara sent an Email to me the day after seeing Dr Falkinstein for the first time and had the pre opt date, the surgery date, and the post op date. All I had to do was show up.
Dr Falkinstein removed the Ruptured Disc at L2-L3 and I came home same day.
The very next day at home a nurse and a physical therapist showed up 3/ a week for 6 weeks.
There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that If not for Dr Falkinstein, I wud still be using my walker at best.
He was a Godsend. This Dr does what he says and says what he’s gona do.
I told my primary Dr, thank for sending me to those two butchers. If u don’t send ur patients to Dr Falkinstein, U R doing your patients a great disservice.My primary Dr never Veted those Butchers or the patients they had cut. He only took their names off the referral list.
Don’t get one or two opinions. Search around and Find at least 3 Dr that agree on the same problem and same solution. That was my mistake putting too much faith in my primary Dr who I don’t see anymore, and not getting lots of opinions.
It’s your Body, get lots of opinions until U R satisfied.
I’m sure after all the searching U will end up back Dr Falkinstein. God Bless this MAN 🤙🏽🤙🏽🤙🏽❤️❤️< /text>

<review>This review is for the Ortho Urgent Care:

TL;DR: For me, the moral of the story is to listen to your gut. If you feel like you aren't being listened to or taken care of, always get a second opinion.

Under OSS's care I ended up in the ER with a massive pulmonary embolism. Details for a more dramatic effect: I had blood clots in all 4 quadrants of my lungs. The response from the ER doctor who treated me was "I've never seen a case so sever".

If the PA's and nurses had just paid a little more attention to me this might have been avoided.

I was referred to OSS from a local urgent care to treat a fracture on the lower part of my fibula (broken ankle). This was a clean break, meaning they didn't have to reposition the bone or do any surgery.

I saw them a total of 3 times: Initial visit to put on cast, 2 week follow up and then a 4 week follow up.

At the time of my 2 week follow up I was complaining about an abnormal amount of swelling and what felt like a constant charlie horse in my calf. I've never broken a lower limb before, so I had no idea this was not normal. The suggested cure for this was elevate (even though I already was). On top of that, the cast that was applied during this follow up was significantly tighter then the previous cast (think even more circulation issues).

On my 4 week follow up the only reason the PA mentioned going to the ER was because I was complaining of shortness of breath. I was so weak that I had to use a wheel chair to get from my car to the front office. I was able to walk from my car to the office both of the previous visits. In hindsight I should have gone to the ER immediately after that visit. I ended up going to the ER the next day.

Never once did they mention the word blot clots or DVT despite my complaints. I'm 32 and don't have a history of blood clots, but you never know and it's always better to be safe.

I had to cancel my 6 week follow up with them (because I was just getting released from the hospital). I told the nurse why and while she said "so sorry for what happened" no one has followed up with me to check on the status of my injury. I chose to follow up with the Ortho that treated me in the hospital instead.

I understand mistakes are made and I am just thankful to be alive and didn't have to take a ride in an ambulance. But this mistake is now costing me thousands of dollars in hospital bills. I guess I should be thankful there is no lasting physical damage to my body. We put so much trust in medical practitioners it always feels like a betrayal when mistakes are made, especially ones this big.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2bfc495f8294f:0xe54d4fcf0f4052fb</gmap_id></record>

I was here before with a friend to help them in, and I must say the front staff, admin  nursing staff were mostly rude and arrogant then. A few not following through as expected. The care is like a factory line.
TODAY I had to go for fractures in my foot and foot internal bleeding and severe pain. Parked 5 blocks away and arrive in pain.
The staff treated me rudely and like I was nothing they needed to deal with.
They then announced a payment I would have to make in order to be seen.
But we spent 3 hours the day before caring for this issue and it was imaged and sent approval letter to all.   Today - they wouldn't take the approval they approved yesterday.
Mind you I. In a lot of pain. And of little worlds
They call me into the office
To care for me - NO!just so they could belittle me and make me feel reidulous. TIM was  the person who had the I do the day before. And All approved. Now, TIM took their e to belittle me, smirk arrogantly and actually laugh. He would not care for the situation. Left the roo. Laughing. And me standing I. An office doorway.
I'm just standing there as I was told no where to go and what was next, when a admin or nurse from behind glass, gets a shocking lookin on her face like I just exploded and one of what the heck is that thing in here.
Out rushed a bouncer nurse, with attitude stating - get out- you have no right to be in here.
Huh?   I was brought to this place by your staff and told to wait right here.
Maybe the docs are good, but it's. Ice to be treated like a human, with out arrogance, or hatred.
This office will certainly Lt make sure of that - so I left waiting for insurance to call them, walked back to my car with my bleeding fractures - denied access to your appointment
Find elsewhere to go  - I've never been treated this poorly before an issue or after an issue at a doctor office.< /review>

Dr Yacoubian and his staff are top notch. I had a badly broken leg and a frozen knee. The surgery was difficult but I'm walking again and have made tremendous progress thanks to Dr Yacoubian's skilled hands.

Everyone is very professional and sweet. I am always in and out quickly, never have to wait long.<//text>

All of the employees at OSS are very helpful and knowledgeable. This has been a great experience. I recommend OSS to everyone.<//text><Name>Olivia Moreno<//Name><Time>1403395004250<//Time><Pics>None< /Pics><rating>5<//rating>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Doctor barely spent anytime, and they canceled the follow up appointment and said that I did it. My suggestion is to not see a doctor with an MBA diploma proudly displayed, it seems they are more concerned with being administrators that doctors.< /Text>< Pictures>

My husband was referred to this clinic by the MPTF and we were scheduled with Omar Duenes/Yuri Falkenstein who said all the right things -- sent us away with medication and a STAT MRI order.  The MRI was done that day and two weeks later we are still waiting for ANY response from OSS.  E-mails and phone calls continue to go unanswered.   Omar Duenes/Yuri Falkenstein and OSS caused a two week delay in treatment and left us completely in the lurch.  If only we had known how useless these people were, we would have had the opportunity to find a real caregiver before now.  As a result of their complete disregard, we get to wait all over again with an actual doctor while my husband continues to suffer.</review>

My appointment was @ 1045. I arrived early at 1015. I had done all the paperwork ahead of time and pre-signed it all. There were about 20 people in the waiting that came and went while I was there. At 1115 (30 minutes after my scheduled time) I was the only one waiting there. I asked how much longer and the women at the front desk rudely said ""shortly". In a minute I was called inside to sit in a room. I set the timer on my phone for 10 minutes and vowed to walk out if no one saw me. At about 1025 I took my file and went back to the front desk and asked for a refund of $175. I explained that for $175 they need to manage their time and patients better. It's not fair that they view their time as precious and will charge you if you are late or a no-show but there are no repercussions if they take their time. I understand what they are doing. Instead of spacing their patients more most office with schedule them within a 15 minute window. Unfortunately, as patients demand more time, longer than the 15 mins it pushes into everyone else's time. It's an unfortunate nature of health care in this country. I ended up going to Urgent Care and being seen within 10 minutes and only paid $100. Totally worth it. No one ever apologized and looked at me like I was some unreasonable complainer.< /review>

On August 14, 2015 - Dr. Shahan Yacoubian changed my mothers life forever ( C.M. ) by replacing her right hip. Truly thankful for all he has done in improving her quality of life. From the initial examination, the scheduling ( Donna is my angel ) to the actual surgery - all admirable.

Update - as of yesterday she walked with only a cane - albeit a short distance but she is improving day by day. When asked "mom was was your pain from 1 to 10 before - she reponded 20...and now ?...she laughed and says maybe 1 or 2 .... Thank You on behalf of myself and my family. God Bless you and your staff for truly caring...

Dr, Alejandro Platon D.C.< /text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<rate>5</rate><Text>My father is 84 yrs. old and was in need of both knees replaced. From the very beginning of the process Dr. Shahan V. Yacoubian and his staff (especially his nurse Donna) have always been very, very professional, kind and patient. This was a struggle for the family being that we, his children did not live close to our Dad. Dr. Yacoubian's staff was always ready to go through that extra mile just to accommodate my father's situation making it so easy to help my father prepare for his surgeries. All I can say is "Thank You"  for all your hard work and patients. My father is now recuperating from his second surgery wonderfully. We as a family and patient of Dr. Shahan Yacoubian strongly recommend anyone that is in need of orthopedic surgery to visit the Orthopedic Surgery Specialists. You will NOT be disappointed. <3</Text>< Pictures>

This is the Calabasas landfill.  Great for general contractors or landscapers looking to dump their trash . The trash must be within its city limits. It cant come from another city.< /review>

We've have ordered multiple refrigerated reach-in merchandisers from Dong Vinh over the past decade, and have always had outstanding experience with their attentiveness and professionalism, from order to installation. When it came time to order our first commercial walk-in freezer, we naturally came to Dong Vinh first, and felt no need to look further. Exceptional product knowledge and guidance in our selection of the right equipment. Let's be real... you can find the same equipment from many different dealers across the state. But you will never find the level of service and support - even after the sale - as you will receive from the team at Dong Vinh. Highly recommended.</text>

My go to spot for any restaurant supplies, and even for my home kitchen! I've bought stock pots, cutting boards, knives, ladles, plastic to-go containers, claypots for braising..everything! The staff and owner are so nice and greet you when you step in, and are super fast in helping me locate items. They even help you carry them to your car!</Text>

<review>I liked this place.  Full of restaurant items some that can be used at home as well.

I went to price their espresso grinder, the Nuova Simonelli was a bit out of my current price range.

I still managed to walk out with a metal container I'll turn into a knockbox, 16" tongs for the bbq at home and a misc cleaning brush.

Customer service is terrible that ruined the whole experience. To top it off the food was not good. Then even more way overpriced.< /Text>

The food is decent. Except no one in that place even know the meaning of what customer service is. So don't expect it. They allow groups to perform there so music is live and very loud! You won't be able to hear yourself think. Tried it once won't go back again.</Text>

Service was just fine, they absolutely try to make you feel welcomed. My problem was with the ingredients and recipes for the "shrimp" enchilada dish I had. The rice was very bland, no matter how much salt you put on it after they bring it out to you it still lacks the appropriate flavor. They are cheap on the shrimp, and what I mean is that they used tiny pre-cooked-frozen shrimp that you could get at any store. WOW, very bland, lacking flavor, the consistency for what a shrimp enchilada should be was a wasted opportunity. How could you mess up such an easy dish? The only good thing on my plate was the beans and even that was served COLD so god knows how long that was out. I have a huge appetite and I usually finish any plate in front of me. I had most the plate unfinished and I didn't even want to take it home. I seriously feel robbed that I paid $18 for such horrible slop. That's why I'm giving this restaurant a 2 star rating because the food was horrible and so were the prices, but it's not the waitress fault that the cook is dealing with inferior ingredients.<//text>

<review>Let me tell u about this place! Im from the cost and im used to a fresh fish and mariscos!! And this place is the closest to same flavor from my town! Im from mazatlan sinaloa! And everyone from there knows how the fish and mariscos needs to be cook! THE RIGHT WAY OR NO WAY!!this guys knows it! Campechanas,ceviche de camaron,and the empanadas!  Don'y forget the tacos governador! Despite the look of the place is a family restaurant although if u dont like live music on ur table it may be a little uncorfotable because they will be musicians going table to table to try to sell u a song but if u do this place  has it all!</review><Pics>None<//Pics><date>1572807395760<//date><GmapID>0x80905391d9f24575:0xa63c34f03411bacf< /GmapID><name>Ozzy Lizarraga</name><Rate>5<//Rate>< user>

<review>I loved this place. This was the place to go after a long day at work. However, my last visit wasn’t so pleasant. My waitress took 30mins to even get out drink order, we got cantaritos and if you’re a regular you know their made with sprite. What we got was water down orange juice. When we asked the waitress she said, “oh we’re out of sprite” I had to tell her to take them away they were nasty. Then we got our food 1 hr after arrival the michelas were really watered down with clamato and they were really stingy on the shrimp. Will not go back again<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Just went there, our food was served 30 minutes after ordering, it was cold & undercooked, really salty. The service was super slow, only 2 families eating at the restaurant when we were there and the waitresses didn't seem to have time to attend us. It took 10 minutes just to get cutlery for our food. Not worth the price... portions are small.< /review>

The waitress was kind and the salmon and tilapia were very good, but the french fries and chicken nuggets were fried with burnt oil, they had a black tint to them. I told the waitress and she replaced them with regular frenchfries. The lettuce was old and had brown on the edges, the yellow and orange carrots had big black spots on them. It seems they just cut up random vegetables without checking if they are good or not.< /Text>

Los camoarons cucaracha are really good if you are someone that like spicy food, and the pescado zarandeado is amazing to (a whole fish) just for you or to share with more people. Sometimes they have live music which i think is great. The staff is ok. We tried their ceviche once, not the best i have had. Over all is a good place to hang out with friends and have some fun.<//Text><Response>None</Response><user>100778070519302486246< /user>< Time>

<Text>(Translated by Google) We are loyal to Las Islitas restaurant.! We are passionate about eating there since they prepare the delicious zarandeado fish very Nayarit style! The music is too loud and that is uncomfortable since you cannot converse with your partner or family while you are eating or waiting to be served. That is horrible, the rest is very good. The waitress is very friendly and the place is very clean. Today we went and it was very delicious 😋 the food !!

Somos fieles a las Islitas restaurant .! Nos apasiona comer allí ya que ellos preparan el delicioso pescado zarandeado muy al estilo Nayarit.! La música demasiado alta y eso es incómodo ya que no puedes conversar con tu pareja o familia mientras estás comiendo o esperando que te atiendan. Eso si es horrible, lo demás muy bien. La mesera muy amable y el local muy limpio todo.! Hoy fuimos y fue muy delicioso 😋 la comida!!</Text>< date>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I ordered a toast of shrimp ceviche and all the ceviche had a bitter cucumber flavor, the cucumber had peel and seeds maybe that gave it that not so nice flavor. After I tried a cocktail, it came back to life and seemed to die of boredom, the juice tasted nothing more than warm water with a little tomato. At the entrance he used to say Nayarit style, but from Nayarit he had nothing. The shrimp empanadas were good, the truth is, the staff was attentive and friendly, keeping an eye on the needs of the customers, but that cooking and seasoning does not convince

(Original)
Pedí una tostada de ceviche de camarón y todo el ceviche tenia un sabor a pepino amargo, el pepino tenia cascara y semillas quizás eso le dió ese sabor no tan agradable. Después probé un cóctel vuelve a la vida y más bien parecía para morirse de aburrimiento, el jugo no sabia a nada más que agua tibia con un poco de jitomate. En la entrada decía estilo Nayarit, pero de Nayarit no tenía nada. Las empanadas de camarón si estaban buenas, la verdad, el personal fue atento y amable, al pendiente de las necesidades de los clientes, pero esa cocina y sazón nomas no convence</Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>(Translated by Google) Very bad service today was my second time at this place and I waited together with my wife for 55 minutes for our food and it never came. Until I asked for the bill they told me that according to my food only so that I would stay but it was false that my food was already there. Too bad that not even the supervisor of the place will come to apologize for waiting in vain.

(Original)
Muy mal servicio hoy fue mi segunda vez en este lugar y espere junto con mi esposa durante 55 minutos para nuestra comida y nunca llegó. Hasta que pedi la cuenta me dijeron que según mi comida sólo para que me quedara pero era falso que mi comida ya estaba. Que mal que ni siquiera el supervisor del lugar se acercará a pedir disculpas por la espera en balde.</review>< userid>

My husband went here. he said the only thing from it being a 5 was the haircut. He said it was pretty good but not great. They were friendly and timely and the atmosphere was great.<//Text>

It is a fast food in haircut industry. The mvp package which everybody is praising so badly isn't anything spectacular and in my opinion isn't worth it. Haircut did have few spots where it looked kinda "silly" on me. But overall a good place for the price.</text>

<review>Margarita did a fantastic job. As a man, not used to the full service type experience. Being able to watch a game, get a top notch cut, then a shampoo and light pressure point massage 💆‍♂️...cmon?!

After 6 years of going to Sport Clips, I am done.  I checked in online with 0 min wait time.  I drove to the salon in 10 mins.  There was someone ahead of me when I got there which was not a big deal.  The clerk did not tell me I need to confirm I was there since I got a notification on my phone I was checked in when I arrived.  The system kicked me out and the stylist told me I had to recheck in.  At this point, I had waited 20 min and now the line was 60 mins long.  She wasnt going to fix the situation.  Between travel and wait time I had wasted almost an hour at this point.  No more.< /Text>

Outstanding Service!!!!! I really like how my haircut came out, it was my first time ever going to Sports Clips and man do I not regret it. Shout out to Chelsea for the cut, you did amazing!! I’m pretty sure everyone else there does a great job, but I know for a fact Chelsea does a magnificent job! I’m definitely going back again. Once again Thank You so much for the cut!!🔥🔥<//Text>

Definitely my place to go when I’m in need of a haircut! After trying many places around the Elk Grove area, I finally found one that just works for me. A shout out to Chelsea for always doing a phenomenal job at my most recent visits. Great environment , definitely recommend it.</Text>

<Name>Mrs.Lincoln</Name><review>There's one guy there's that's great at cutting hair. The chicks are rude and cut my son's hair to there liking and not mine. I went in and asked for a fair with 0 at the bottom and the chick did a 1 rather than 0 thinking I wouldn't be able to tell the difference and stated she thought it'd look better....< /review>< resp>

Seriously from start to finish this place was great. Aenjoli was awesome. She explained what she was going to do and was really good at explaining it all. She did a great job and I feel like I got something that cost atleast 60 to 70 dollars. This place is rad🤙</review>< Pics>

Variable service. Advertise MVP but give shampoo only and charging for all. Most of the hair dressers are in inexperienced. They have no idea what they are doing. I have been to sports clip at other States and City, this seems to be the worse.< /Text>

The person who was cutting my hair was more concerned about what the staff was ordering for lunch instead of cutting my hair. She didn't even offer the mvp experience which is what I really came in for. Won't be going back to this location<//review>

<review>Located across from a self serve car wash in Old Town Clovis.  Has restrooms and yet its a quaint little park with a few bench tables and a small playground.  There is traffic nearby off of Clovis Avenue but its set off the road enough to relax and enjoy</review>< gmap_id>

I used to play at this park as a child in the 90’s and I still come by to use the restroom in between errands and I also love the cute little squirrels running around.</Review>

It's a great place to go for lunch, shade trees, parking, public restrooms that everything works and are clean plus fun playground equipment for kids to enjoy.<//Text>

Nice quiet park. Often not occupied. Its a little close to the street for my comfort and there's often homeless near the picnic and bbq areas. Otherwise it's a nice place for a quick little stop to get the wiggles out.< /review>

I go here all the time during my lunch break, no tweakers disrupting the peace. Lots of shade to relax and enjoy a meal. Busy street so playing with a ball might not be ideal, but it's fun to watch the cars pass by.</Text>

It's a very nice little park BUT we only stayed for a couple of minutes because my toddler needed to use the restroom and they we're ALL locked so we had to leave when we had planned to stay there for a couple hours for my kids to enjoy and it was impossible. Very disappointed knowing people go there with they're toddler's and not be able use the restrooms.< /text>

This is a nice park for single families  to go  Have a picnic, or enjoy the children's playground. It's is a very small triangular-shaped park. It is well equipped with a children's playground, several picnic tables, and a nice brick barbecue.< /Text>

The park is far enough from the street that I was never concerned while my son was playing. There are cigarette buds to be found in the rubber chips and scattered around which is not pleasant.</Text>

Great price for all you can eat, the staff was super friendly welcoming in nice I will definitely be back. Most of the customers they noticed we're regulars because the servers knew them by name. That to me speaks volumes about the place. You won't be disappointed! The 😀</Review>

Great food great service. I've never met a friendlier team in staff. They have an all you can eat option on their menu. The restaurant wasn't packed so the service was very quick. I would prefer it this way. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is interested in sushi by the plate or all you can eat. Will be coming back again.< /Review>

Been going here for years and it seems like it's under new management. The sushi is good and the service was good. Just remember if you pay cash you get a 10% discount.</Text>

The Sushi was fresh and yummy.  However they only had two servers and one of them couldn't tell you what roll she was putting down on the table.  The were busy but it took so long for food and beverages to come. They were also struggling to keep tables clean and clear!  The the two servers were  polite and fast just very shorthanded....<//Text>

Great service, and excellent fish. I highly recommend the seared salmon. They use a garlic sauce that will singe your nose hairs off. Fantastic stuff!<//Review>

This used to be our go to place for sushi, but not anymore. We decided to go there for dinner. Different chefs, young server, and the place seemed run down. We did AYCE, which was pricey, $27.99. The sushi was meh, and kept falling apart. The young server was by herself, working all the tables. As we entered, there were no available tables for four people. There were only a few full tables, the rest were dirty with dishes, and one "reserved" table. The server decided to bus/clear a table for us. When we were seated, she told us to be careful, as there was a spill under our table. So, she cleaned the table, but did not want to clean the sticky soda mess on the floor.</Review>

<review>Wow....if I could give negative stars I would!  I was refused sefvice at the sushi bar as a female business professional  dining alone.  I sat and watched other patrons (including children) be seated at sushi bar and get a warm greeting and have their order taken.  When I inquired with the host what the problem was...I was told they would be happy to take my order "TO GO.".   I was shocked and walked out.  Rude discriminatory people!  I will NEVER return!!!</review><Name>Dee B<//Name>< user_id>

I have tried many places for sushi, all over SoCal. Jun's is one of my favorite. Super Fresh, the Staff are attentive and Friendly, the Chef's really know what they are doing and they take care of you.  If you are looking for a good place for Sushi, try these folks out, you will not be disappointed with anything they have to offer.<//Text>

The sushi here is pretty good for an all you can eat.  The fish, rice, was an 7 out of 10 for me.  My biggest concern is how fast the sushi chefs are at preparing the dishes and wait staff in attending to your needs.

When you order make sure to order everything you want at first go.  Food took upto 40 mins to come out and an 1hr and 15mins before my total first round of ordering was complete.

The slow serving times for chefs and wait staff isnt from laziness but just seems like inefficiency.   Everybody is running around like crazy but food and service is so so soooo slow.<//text>

Could not eat and could not drink much. I didn't eat for six days and decided to go the hospital. They diagnosed me instantly. Hep A....I was in the hospital for a week and out of work for 2 months.

I drove all the way from North Carolina just beeming with excitement to enjoy this restuarant's warm welcome and delicious and always superb fresh menu. 1st time here in the middle of the week and it was even more friendly. Steve makes specials that are unparralleled. Love. it. here. Every. Time.</text>

Granny’s Donuts did an absolutely amazing job with these custom donuts for our son’s 2nd birthday!! Not only did they look incredible, but they tasted SO good. Our guests devoured the donuts. We didn’t have many guests but had only maybe 2 donuts left over. People who claimed to “never eat donuts” went back for seconds and thirds! I’m still hearing from family about how good the donuts were.

I didn’t give the woman who helped me at Granny’s much direction outside of the text, basic color scheme, and party theme. She ran with it and did a beautiful job. I think I’m done with cake and cupcakes and going with Granny’s Donuts for all future birthday parties!< /text>

The donuts are always great as usual.  Where they really shine is their breakfast menu that tastes great. I highly recommend the breakfast burrito. I recommend this place to anyone who enjoys food.< /Review>

I was surprised that they stay open 24/7... Got a midnight craving and went at 10pm with my daughter, to pig out. Surprisingly, everything was fresh. Good prices. Good selection. I'll be going back.< /Review>

They have a maple bacon “Cronut” that is very bit of sugary deliciousness. Must try.  Also good customer service.<//Review>

I asked the employee if they don't wear a mask, his response was: "is my choice not to wear a mask, I decline to serve you", It is also my choice not to buy there again, customer for years, good donuts, but hygiene is more important to me.< /Text>

Love Granny's. Tasty donuts, big muffins. Yummy breakfast/ lunch sandwiches. Friendly customer service.  Since it's along our daily walking route, we usually stop in to pick up quick breakfast, lunch or snack. 👍😋</review>

Went here in the morning, place is full of tweakers. The people who work there don’t care to wear a mask correctly. One lady leaves her nose exposed the whole time. The other lady baking donuts isn’t wearing a mask at all. I’m sure the donuts are good but the environment is a mess. Dirty and risky. Corona virus would feel warm and cozy in that place<//Text>

I was surprised, coz it had just enough sweetness and the dough was really soft and I loved it. And then I ordered the chocolate ice cream. It was homemade and it tasted good. The chocolate was strong and dark. I will go back and probably be a regular.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOaw9EnHB-Xd5jaQrwvpkJ6ILms2Xuplz5UumEV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

Excellent place to grab a delicious donut or a dozen. Although I'm partial to the  ham and cheese croissant - delicious! Great friendly staff. Very fair prices. Total neighborhood feel. A place you can run in, grab something, and go or stay and sit outside and enjoy your food in the California sun.<//review>

<Text>First time trying this place, I was craving a Green tea matcha frap.walked in and the lady didn't greet me, she didn't ask what size of drink I wanted she automatically charged me for the medium. There was two guys playing Lotto with their feet out on the seats. The frappe was no good at all no whip cream like in the picture and lacked a lot of the green tea flavor.<//Text><name>Kevin Marroquin<//name></record>

<Text>Small donut shop that is a local hangout for some of the retirees in the area.  This location was bought out by a young couple when the previous owners retired.  They have been slowly remodeling and many of the old, unused items in the seating area have been removed, opening up the space.  The service is much more friendly than before and they are trying out new items on their menu.  The inside tables have been cleaned up and the chairs either repainted or replaced.<//Text>< date>

<name>Tamara Kennedy</name>< review>
New owners deep cleaned this place. The donuts are fresh even warm. The COFFEE IS BETTER THAN MY OLD FRIEND STAR BUCKS...I never thought that could be possible...but these people are experts. The warm donuts and kick ass coffee made my eyes roll back in my head..so whats an extra workout this is welllll worth the extra workout..I have to mention this...they are so nice..they remember your favorites...they remember you here..the second time under new owners i entered and the pretty lady behind the counter said "good morning how are you so nice to see you back to get the coffee you like so much? Black no sugar no cream...and one warm glaze? We have three kinds warm but all donuts here are fresh made from 3 in the morning until 5 minutes ago..". The words ,I'LL TAKE A DOZEN ,flew out of my mouth without regret..i ate only my share...although i admit my compulsion was to take a bite from all 12 therby claiming ownership and obligation to consume. However, I resisted. Come to this place it is off the hook...so just like i remembered from when i was little. Fresh donuts, super clean, strong perfect cofee not pissy cheap coffee but great roasted fresh ground coffee, and the best customer service ever! Ya gotta go no joke,</review>

Image Locations helped me find an amazing location for my wedding. It was a dream come true! The location was ideal and my wedding was beautiful thanks to them. Their team was extremely helpful and professional and they made sure that our wedding was safe during these hard times. They are working 7 days a week and they are always available for their clients which is really impressive. Their service is truly impressive. Highly recommended!< /Text>

<review>Image Locations has a beautiful range of amazing properties you can choose from. Their agents are great at what they do – they guide you and help you find exactly what you’re looking for. You are guided from the beginning to the end of the project and it makes everything ten times easier. You can’t find a better company for quality locations and top-notch services.</review>< Pics>

When I need a Location Service - My first call is Paul, Paul Kim and his company Image Locations. Many many years of providing great locations, great website, and service that is way better than others in this business. Also, property owners would greatly benefit from Image Locations representation, and Paul"s likable personality and enthusiasm make the business relationship enjoyable. I could go on and on with so many positives comments, just call Paul and you'll see!

It’s not a job if you love what you do. Good people and beautiful place to work. Visiting and setting up beautiful locations is something I look forward to everyday. And did I mention we get to meet and work with celebrities. Always something new and exciting. Having a great time here!< /text>

<review>If you're a producer/filmmaker, THIS is the place for you. Their library's enormous and super diverse. But the game changer is the agents' knowledge of the industry. They steer you around every potential stumbling point, every potential permit issue, heck even which troublesome neighbors to look out for! I can't even describe how much time & frustration they save me every time -- I'm always learning from them too. And because it's Hollywood things *do* go sideways when you least expect it, but in my experience, the agents at Image are right there alongside you, creatively helping save the project. Don't hesitate. They're invaluable.< /review><response>None<//response><username>Patrick Ward-Perkins< /username>< time>

Such a luxurious and professional company! I am amazed. I’ve never seen people more knowledgeable about what they do. They have some beautiful estates to choose from and for almost every occasion. The team is just amazing and I fully trust them with my needs. They are a joy to work with and I couldn’t recommend them more.< /text>

Image Locations helped us find the perfect location for our corporate event. The staff was very professional and the services were efficient. The best part is, they are open 7 days a week to help their clients. We are highly impressed with their quality services. They are now our go-to place for finalizing our event locations!</text>

Image locations is a fantastic company when scouting for your next filming location. Owner, Paul Kim always goes out of his way to guide you through securing the best location. He is always available to assist and can secure a location in a quick time frame. His staff is professional, helpful and friendly.
I look forward to a continuing our business relationship!!!</text>

A few years ago I needed  to rent one of my properties and Image Locations helped me to get it done. My home was in the market for less than a day and got rented out. They are fast and efficient. I have enjoyed working with everyone on their team. Highly recommend their services.<//Text>

Image Locations has the most extensive collection of amazing properties to choose from in the biz.  Their website is built to navigate with ease, and the agents are always on hand to guide their clients through the process from the beginning of the project, right up until final wrap.   When in search of top quality locations with top quality service, there is no better.<//Text>

Our experience here was sort of like an expectations vs. reality meme. From what they've been telling our team, we imagined the setting to be something we would really like. But it turned out to be something far from what we expect. It was very disappointing.<//review>

I worked as a Television producer for 25 years, and Paul is my favorite business owner I’ve ever worked with.  I’ll let you in on a few of his secrets to success.  For one, his desk is the reception desk at his office.  Two, he answers the main business phone himself quite a bit.  Three: he forwards his business phone to his cell at night.  Dedication times 1,000!</Text>

Though the estates they have are good, they are too overpriced. You can get good locations as the ones they offer if you do some basic online digging. Don't waste your money here.</Text>

was my experience with Image Locations. The source of which is it's Owner Paul Kim, a man who is positive and inspirational fast as life who keeps up to detail. No one is irrelevant to him no detail is too small and because of this The American Cement Building became synonymous with Image Locations and in turn all of us at staff benefited from Image Locations.

Worked as a Covid Compliance Officer on a two day shoot at the lovely new Wall Street studio location in DTLA. I've shot at many studios during the pandemic and must say that I was extremely impressed with how safe and professional the space and staff were. Working with Image Locations was a dream and I look forward to working more jobs at their locations.</text>

<Text>Management there made many promises they couldn't keep. They made rules that did not follow themselves. And you would never catch them digging and doing any of the management work because they didn't even know to do such management work. They compulsively stirred the pot and were often the source of the vilest back channel gossip.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I visit this spot a lot since I work nearby. I like how their customer service is always good and they keep the place well kept consistently. Rates are reasonable and they serve large portions.< /text>

Friendly service (sometimes) depending on what you want.
FILTHY,  DISGUSTING facility!
After having already eaten half of the dinner my wife and I ordered,  I needed to use the restroom.
This was the most disturbing men's room I've ever seen in my life!
It appeared as though the restroom had never been cleaned in the entire existence of the building! Ever!
Check out the 3 photos I've posted of this dump.  YES! Ladies & Gentlemen, that is an actual Turd on the floor!
If these people can't be trusted to maintain a simple restroom,  then how can they be trusted serving food to the public?
Never Again!</Review>

I've been to Louie's many times, and it's always good. I have found that it's more enjoyable to dine in as opposed to buying from the takeout bar. The food is cooked fresh to order and delicious!</Review>

Food was delivered cold.  Mongolian beef had zero flavor.  Crab rangoons weren’t crab rangoons and had zero crab in them at all.  The sweet and sour ordered on the side came in a thimble sized container and tasted so metallic it was inedible.  Usually I don’t post reviews but for the money that was spent it was needed.< /review>

Horrible service. Aside from that I asked for an extra sweet & sour sauce container and the lady at the counter gave me a dirty container that was half-empty leading me to assume that it must have been used before hand.<//text>

Yo these 2 ladies that work here are so rude to everyone, they have a terrible attitude and they tax way too much. The plates are $6.99 on the menu and it'll come up to $8.50. The smallest box of chicken is $3. And they charge you to use card and come up with way more ways to get money out of you.<//text>

The staff was sincere in providing good service and the food was tasty. I enjoyed  a lunch special Asparagus chicken over a choice of two different types of rice with a choice of two soups.
Pricing was fantastic and the quantity of food was excellent.< /text>

<Text>I was sad when I left the bay because I also left behind my favourite Chinese food restaurant, but the food here is delicious, fresh and they don't skimp on the portions. And the egg rolls are probably the best I've ever had.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>I was charged twice for the same order, once on the online menu and then again after a phone call with Louie's Chinese Food to "confirm" my card number. When I showed the delivery guy "the Manager" the online bank statement showing two charges for the same order he refused and told me I don't deserve a refund, we then went on to argue for 20 minutes in front of my house. The "Manager" was raising his voice, becoming very defensive and yelling at me when I would ask for a refund or ask how to get a refund with kids and neighbors around. This is a very disrespectful and unprofessional way to handle a customer complaint as "Manager" of the store. We could not come to an agreement as he declined my request for a refund for one of the two charges so I sent him on his way.  I had to make several phone calls before I was issued a refund for one of the two charges. The phone call I made to get the refund was not affiliated with the restaurant. By the time the arguing was over the food was cold anyway. I will never buy from Louie's Chinese Food.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

We've been fortunate to be able to have traveled around most of America.  This is one of the most spectacular drives in the country.  Pay the entrance fee, take your time, and you'll see some once-in-a-lifetime things.  Tidal pools, sea lions, walrus..and yes, some of the best golf courses in the country.

We've been up and down the entire American Pacific coast, and this is one of the best spots.</text>

Very pretty. It’s a 10$ fee to enter. Views similar to Big Sur. I would say a definitely one time visit place</text>

Just the place you need to heal a tired spirit and a cluttered mind! Very restorative & relaxing. If you haven't been, get up and GO!< /review>

<Text>Very scenic drive, with several amazing spots to get down the car and relax for a while. Parking spaces available at most spots, though less in number. Benches, dustbins, other facilities well available to have lunch or just relax for half a day or so. Friendly for running, cycling as well. Just an hour long drive from San Jose. Perfect for a day trip.<//Text>< pics>

Was a very windy day. Cost $17. In may 2021. Saw Pebble Beach. ❤️ Beautiful ocean views, and cute deer grazing on the golf course. 😁 Couldn't find a bathroom to save my life.</Text>

<review>Beautiful drive and nice way to spend an afternoon. There is a bunch of different marked view points with nice sites and you can just stop along the way. There is also beaches if you want to get out and relax a bit. Get to see some of the golf courses and plenty of the ocean. Costs $10.50 to get in with a car, but if you stop at one of the money restaurants you get that back. Suggest stopping at the Inn at Spanish Bay at the end and having a drink and some food by the firepits and if you get there at the right time you can see the piper come in playing the bag pipes to close the course for the day. Great way to spend an afternoon in Carmel!<//review>< pictures>

<review>An outstanding and must-do if you're in Monterey. The best way to see it is on an E-bike from Adventures by the sea! Hands down no other way will give you the views and experience you get from the ebike tour! It's phenomenal! Don't waste your time driving it, or beat your body up by walking it...you will thank yourself for choosing the ebike.</review>< time>

<Review>Some of the attractions can't really be seen because of over grown trees, some have been sectioned off  so you can't see it at all but you're still paying full  price for an incomplete experience. The beaches were nice.</Review>< rate>

Plan your day and start early so that you can fully enjoy each individual section of this coastline at Pebble Beach. There are total of 17 places to stop and fully take in the scenery here. Then grab a lunch at the Pebble Beach Market and enjoy your lunch under the sun over look the bay. If you can, visit this beautiful place during the weekdays instead of the weekend. You’ll come to appreciate what this place has to offer. If you do like to explore the rustic forest, do plan to head there on early part of the day instead. The S.F.B Morse Botanical reserve is worth seeing.<//text>

< Review>
7 Mile Drive hugs the rugged Californian coastline and a $10.50 toll gave us access to the route, multiple stopping points and restroom facilities. Along the pleasant and easy drive we got to see the churning Atlantic smashing into the various rock formations, sending up plumes of sea spray. Some of the rocks are home to seals, sea lions, pelicans, cormorants and gulls. We were entertained for a decent amount of time by a very noisy sea lion trying to clear a patch of rock for his exclusive use, only for it to be refilled by pelicans the instant his back was turned. Golfing fans were enthralled by Pebble Beach Links golf course (venue for the 2019 US Open), where you can have lunch in the clubhouse even if you can’t fit in 18 holes.</Review>

17 mile drive looks beautiful on a cloudy weather day. The points on the 17 mile drive are lots of them. find only few spots to spend more time. stopping at each point takes time and not a very good idea. the shore can be so slippery, should be careful on the big rocks.< /Text>

Definitely worth the $10 admission to see some amazing coastal scenery and portions of one of the most iconic golf courses in the country. There's plenty of places to pull off on the side of the road and take in the sights, and I definitely recommend taking your time and checking out many of these spots. If you're lucky you may even see some marine wildlife! There are some public restrooms along the route as well as a gift shop and a few restaurants.<//Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>It is truly a beautiful stretch of the Earth with multiple pull offs for either a drive, bike, or walk.  All manner of wildlife can be seen including deer, cranes, sea lions, sea birds, and even a whale depending on the season.  Watching the waves crash on the rocks and the beach was an amazing experience.  I highly recommend it. (Be warned that if you are going to bike the road, there are some points where there is no bike specific trail)< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4iSi6erAnx2vl2WKVVRdLF0Wxm7vhFy1HxqlU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAw8oAV1Z19s4KGh2f4pt0Zz4Fk_J7K-VOleOE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Response>

Beautiful drive. I took my aunt who was visiting from Hawaii and she thought it was beautiful as well. Especially, since each spot we stopped at had a sign with a brief story on the history of the area. We will definitely visit again.</Text>

Hands down no other way will give you the views and experience you get from the ebike tour! It's phenomenal! Don't waste your time driving it, or beat your body up by walking it...you will thank yourself for choosing the ebike.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>17 mile drive looks beautiful on a cloudy weather day. The points on the 17 mile drive are lots of them. find only few spots to spend more time. stopping at each point takes time and not a very good idea. the shore can be so slippery, should be careful on the big rocks.</Text>< user_name>

Some of the attractions can't really be seen because of over grown trees, some have been sectioned off  so you can't see it at all but you're still paying full  price for an incomplete experience. The beaches were nice.< /review>

This is our favorite place to visit. It takes just $10.25 dollars(cash only) to enter. There are many spots that you can stop and take pics. But we generally like the first 5-6 spots and spend most of our time in there. Go early in morning or during sunset, you will get some of the most fabulous pics. Also note that the entry fee is refundable if you dine in one of the eligible restaurants in pacific grove. Checkout the pics!! West shore is incomplete without 17-mile drive!!!<//Text>

You do get some nice views of the Pacific ocean, but you can get those anywhere up and down Highway 1 for free.

One of the stops is "China Rock". Its description is a sentence long: "there used to be a chinese fishing village at this rock." The description doesn't do justice to these fishermen and the discrimination they faced. In fact, the natural features on this drive have longer descriptions than this "rock".

Feels like you're just being used to subsidize green fees.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<review>17-Mile Drive is a scenic road through Pebble Beach and Pacific Grove on the Monterey Peninsula in California, much of which hugs the Pacific coastline and passes famous golf courses, mansions and scenic attractions, including the Lone Cypress, Bird Rock and the 5,300-acre Del Monte Forest of Monterey Cypress trees.
The drive serves as the main road through the gated community of Pebble Beach. Inside this community, nonresidents have to pay a toll to use the road.
Like the community, the majority of 17-Mile Drive is owned and operated by the Pebble Beach Corporation. The 17-Mile Drive is a 17-mile (27 km)-long scenic loop having four primary entrances - the main highway entrance at California State Route 1, and entrances in Carmel and Pacific Grove.
The 17-Mile Drive guide map you get at the gate will give a brief description of each point of interest, or you can check the 17-Mile Drive Map online. Allow 3 hours or more for the whole drive, especially if you stop to eat or take a lot of photographs.<//review><Pics>[{'url':

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>It is truly a beautiful stretch of the Earth with multiple pull offs for either a drive, bike, or walk.  All manner of wildlife can be seen including deer, cranes, sea lions, sea birds, and even a whale depending on the season.  Watching the waves crash on the rocks and the beach was an amazing experience.  I highly recommend it. (Be warned that if you are going to bike the road, there are some points where there is no bike specific trail)</Text>< Pics>

There's a small fee of $10 to enter but that's fairly negligible for the amount of breath taking views that you get off the Pacific Ocean.

Plenty of places to stop and park to see the flora and fauna and get close to the ocean.  There's an area of white sand beach which is mesmerizing in itself.  The drive is fairly mountainous but doable for an average driver.
It does get pretty crowded over holiday weekends so be prepared to be stuck in traffic and taking rounds to find a parking spot.<//text>< Pics>

One of the most amazing drives I've ever done (maybe the best). After paying $10.25 you can drive along the most amazing sceneries. Just take you time to see all the high lights by following the signs along the road< /text>

But the views a fantastic and trust me nothing will make you feel more poor than driving this. We got some awesome pics, the views a great at the vista points and you learn a few things too.  I would recommend this drive and also big Sur PCH.< /Review>< Pics>

First few stops from PG arereally beautiful and fun, but the last few miles are boring AF once you get away from the coastline. You can get a glimpse of a few hideous houses that you'll still never be able to afford. If you're house is going to be that ugly, you should at least have an ocean view...<//Review>

This is a beautiful drive! There’s a $10.25 fee to go through the condominium but it was worth every penny. We watched one of the most beautiful sunsets by the Country Club West golf place that has a section that goes to the water.< /review>

Full of different greenery, both terrestrial and aquatic. Also this is a rare place to find all different kind of animals just on the way. The funny thing is I always looked for a specific place of the same name where you will find multi-colored, gem-like stones on the beach, but that is something called Glass Beach in more north.

I know this is not a review for a freeway, but I am dying to mention it. I have been here at least ten times now, most of the times with someone new to California. I think I have mentioned the super-cool biodiversity around it in some other reviews too. Even I wrote an entire blog in local guide forums. The one thing I am yet to do is to start from the southern side and ending up in Monterey.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

The scenic spots are so surreal. It’s unbelievably beautiful. The pebble beach, bird rock, seal rock and lone cypress are the most beautiful attractions in my opinion. Make sure to get a jacket as this place can get very chilly. I’ve visited this place on a sunny September day yet I had to wear a good jacket. The breeze gets very cold.< /text>

What a wonderful road ...
Visited it for my last day in the area of Monterey before going back to France.
You only need to pay $10 and you can stay as long as you want! (Small tip: visit during sunset)
Pretty houses, nice road to ride slowly so that you won’t miss anything!
And certainly the most beautiful sunset I’ve ever seen...
A little photo attached of this unique moment ...
I will miss this place so much!< /Review>

<text>It has always been one of the best scenic drive in beautiful California coastline. Many small beaches along the drive for picnic, stroll, sightseeing. It might be chilly in early morning or late afternoon. A round of golf here is $700. This area will be packed during Pro Am. There is public restroom facility in the visitor center. There are shops, restaurants as well.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<review>Extraordinary road that goes through beaches, lookouts, a bird rock, forests and ends at the beautiful Carmel-by-the-Sea beach, besides, of course, its great attraction: the Lone Cypress, the picturesque tree of approximately 250 years old that stands alone on a granite pedestal!

Road access costs U$ 10.50 per car.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Text>Fantastic must-do when you are near San Francisco. Its a beautiful scenic tour along the pacific coastline with great view over the sea.

It's a nice drive along a private section of the coast near Carmel. Beautiful homes and Golf courses. It offers many pull off spots to take pictures or stopping and taking the sights in.< /text>

<text>A very scenic drive just to the south of San Francisco/San Jose. Although very touristy, this place does have it's own charm. I visited this place in the month of December, which is cold months for the Bay Area. I was still able to spot quite a lot of cars and people trying to enjoy the beauty of this drive. I cant imagine how busy this place might be during the summers though.

The drive has shoreline on one side, and big bungalows and golf course on the other side. it has total of about 15-20 points, which are situated almost next to each other. We visited during the morning time, and could see beautiful sunlight shinning on the waves. Loved the effects.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6fK20_Byx_xcUgyple4xo1CU84bjr6bJHH59l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< rate>

This drive is really beautiful. And a very famous thing to do if it’s on your bucket list. Really worth the visit. There’s an entry fee to take this drive about $10. But the view points are simply stunning and the beaches and ocean is superb. Highly recommended. We loved our day out here !!<//text>

Pretty road? Yes. Worth $10.50? Absolutely not. Highway 1 has way better views on many segments, for free.<//Review>

Fabulous on a clear day.  Gorgeous beaches, lots of diverse wildlife.  We even saw whales spouting in the distance.   There are many tide pools with colorful anemone and hermit crabs.   Budget three hours.   If you eat at a restaurant within the area, they will deduct the $10.50 they charge to enter the drive< /Text>

<Text>17-Mile Drive is another gem in the California crown!

California has soooooo much beauty, yet even within that 17-Mile Drive is especially beautiful. With its gentle twists and turns, there are spots to get out and gawk and walk around and feel a sense of awe.

it's truly an incredible place!<//Text>< date>

It coasts $10.25 to drive around some very expensive houses.  You are able to pull off and view some beautiful vistas.</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>This drive is really beautiful. And a very famous thing to do if it’s on your bucket list. Really worth the visit. There’s an entry fee to take this drive about $10. But the view points are simply stunning and the beaches and ocean is superb. Highly recommended. We loved our day out here !!</review>< Pics>

Pretty road? Yes. Worth $10.50? Absolutely not. Highway 1 has way better views on many segments, for free.<//text>

Fabulous on a clear day.  Gorgeous beaches, lots of diverse wildlife.  We even saw whales spouting in the distance.   There are many tide pools with colorful anemone and hermit crabs.   Budget three hours.   If you eat at a restaurant within the area, they will deduct the $10.50 they charge to enter the drive</Review>

17-mile drive was the most beautiful roads and scenes I've ever driven in America. If you're not afraid of heights and a careful driver, this drive is a must. Go alone or with someone who'll also appreciate scenery.< /Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Prepare to spend at least a few hours here to truly appreciate it all - or all day to really get your money’s worth. Entrance to the 17-mile-drive costs $10.50 and is very worth it. They’ll give you a map of all the attractions at the start and there’s usually parking at each one with signposts explaining the history. The only truly crowded attraction is the Lone Cypress, so prepare to wait for parking if you plan on stopping there. There are also a number of hikes/walks you can take, so both beach and hiking shoes are a good idea. Some attractions have picnic benches for eating, but not all.

It's nice drive through with multiple stops. A family can easily spend 3-4 hours, going through it. If you have option to bike, that's even better.<//review>

<review>Didn’t know there was a fee to drive through, but it was worth it! The self-guided tour was educational and fun! Beautiful homes to look at and (even with some fog) we enjoyed ourselves.<//review>< pictures>

At US$10.75, one can visit a drive to 17-Mile Drive and experience a life time opportunity. Entire route is awesome and full of spots on the way. Most of the spots, reasonably good information with pictures are displayed. On every mile, one can fascinate to see new spots. All spots are unique and different than the last one.  Really, it is worth to drive 17-Mile with family and friends. Do not forget to keep food stuff and enough water bottles, specially if you are visiting with kids. Entry fee is on higher side but it is worth. Entire area is too good to take 'n' number of pictures.

Enjoy your drive.< /text>

Must see once in lifetime. The entry fee is minimum and affordable. Lots of points for more memorable snaps. Do not forget to take your DSLR if you have one. Marked the roads with red (dividers) to differentiate the 17 mile drive from the usual ones. One can spend full day over here and nice place to drive with your loved ones. Happy driving!!!<//Text>

We  drove along the length of the California Hwy 1 from San Francisco to San Diego and the 17-Mile drive was definitely one of the more scenic and serene places to visit. It is a photographer's dream! It is worth the $10 entry fee to get in. We spent about 2-3 hours there visiting places of interest listed on their maps. We even saw a couple of deers in the woods along the road. I would highly recommend this drive on the 17 Mile Drive!< /Text>

<Text>If you are expecting to see pebble beach on this drive you will be disappointed.  Dont get me wrong this is a pretty cool little touristy thing to do. The landmark cypress trees and amazing ocean views are worth the trip, but you barely get a glimpse the world famous course. The homes on this drive are amazing.. or at least what you can see through huge privacy gates, fences, and landscaping. Be warned, it costs about $10 to take the drive. There is also a beach and some vista points you can park and have a closer look.<//Text>< name>

Just tell them you're renting a house on the drive and save the fee - they might ask you for an address but you can just make something up (eg '3200 17 Mile Drive').  I think the billionaire community would survive without your contribution.  Very pretty drive though</text>

Breath taking scenery of Monterey coast, however, as expected too many tourists and vehicles, but worth doing it once.</text>

This is a nice drive along the ocean offering some great views. Lots of nice ocean views, big homes and overall CA coastal beauty.

Suggestions:
* Weekends (esp Summer) can be crowded (goes without saying)

* To get the best part, start at the Pacific Grove gate entrance (instead of the main Hwy 1 entrance) and get off the Carmel exit.

* The Inn at Spanish bay is a nice place for lunch (it's right at the start if you follow this route). But if you are on a budget, pack some food from the town of Pacific Grove (just before you enter) and eat at the picnic tables. Overall the food along the 17-mile drive is great but very pricey.

* The beaches along the drive are nice, but Carmel beach is nicer. So if you want to get into the water (it's cold no matter where you go on this coast), just view the beaches on the drive and once you get to Carmel, go to the beach there. It's much nicer (less sea weed too).

* End the day with some shopping and dinner at Carmel-By-the-Sea. Its a cute little town.< /Text>

The 17 miles looks like a meseum of the luxurious properties and estates across the California coasts! The scenery are great, but the $10.50 charge per vehicle was not a great deal!</Review>

We all love this beautiful area. Disappointed they rerouted the exit to Hwy 1 instead of the old route into Ocean Ave in Carmel< /Review>

The California Coast is beautiful to drive on but as a tax payers we shouldn’t have to pay to drive through this section we already pay enough taxes in this state so my point is if you go to this section and pay the $10 you’re getting ripped off Stand your ground and go around there’s plenty of coast to drive and see with money we already pay.</Text>

Nice scenic drive, but 10,50$ is too much and there are way too many tourists in summer (busses full with asians)..</text>

$10 to get in, awesome stops along the way so use the brochure they give you with about 20 points of interest.  Lone Cypress is awesome.</Text>

After you visit Point Lobos State Park and drive along the cost to Bixby Bridge, you will find that the 17 miles drive is a waste of time; not much for the $10.25 they charge.
Most of the drive is through residential area with beautiful, interesting homes and golf courses.
If you have the time drive along the cost to Big Sur. It is really breath taking and free.< /review>

(Translated by Google) You pay $10.75 and go in, but I don't think it's a waste.
I am sorry that the weather was a little cloudy, so I would like to visit again.

(Original)
10.75달러를 결제하고 들어가지만, 비용이 아깝다는 생각은 들지 않습니다.
날씨가 조금 흐렸던게 아쉬워서 또 방문하고 싶습니다.< /Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The 17-mile drive to Coastal Road 1 is a toll road at $ 10 per vehicle ('September 19).
Make 17 points and get off the drive to see the scenery. I built a road in a golf club, and some nice villas
a lot.
Compared to coastal roads, inspiration may be slightly lower.
Although it feels similar to the coast of Jeju Island, it's a quiet walk.
If you have time, please visit

1번 해안도로와 연결되는 17마일 드라이브는 유료 도로로 차량당 10달러(‘19년9월기준)입니다.
17개 포인트를 만들어놔 드라이브중 내려서 풍경을 볼 수 있습니다. 골프 클럽 내 도로를 가꾸었고, 주변에 멋진 별장들이
많습니다.
해안도로와 비교하자면 감흥이 약간 떨어질 수 있습니다.
제주도 해안과 비슷한 느낌을 받기도 하지만, 조용하게 산책하기 좋습니다.

<review>(Translated by Google) If you are doing the path of the Big One, you cannot miss this stop. Pebble Beach. It is a closed neighborhood that is accessed by paying $ 10 per car. They give you a map where they show you the different viewpoints.

It is divided by different stops that the map indicates. Paradores towards the Pacific Ocean, which hits the coast hard. Rocky beach sectors. Every landscape is incredible. What's more, surely you saw the classic photo of the Cipress, it is a tree in the middle of the rocks at the tip of the peninsula. Postcard characteristic of the area.
Amazing landscapes, beautiful home.

In this complex you will also find the famous pebble beach golf course, the site of several international tournaments. Undoubtedly a very complex court due to the winds in the area. One of its holes is right between the road and the sea.

But the coastal scenery is impressive. Despite being a short tour, each one offers a different landscape.

Ideal to do it with children, friends or as a couple. Do not miss this beautiful place. It is very accessible and it will surprise you.

You will also find the architecture of the area, imposing houses in the middle of this green forest. The song of the birds in the whole area is striking.

An activity to do as a family is the construction of Torres. At one of the first stops you will find a beach full of rounded, cream-colored rocks. Build the tallest tower you can as a family! That is very careful with your feet. If any rock slips it can hurt a lot.
This beach has tables and chairs, ideal for a stop on the trip, a picnic on the shore of the turquoise ocean.

Si estas haciendo el camino de la Big One, no podes perderte esta parada. Pebble Beach.  Es un barrio cerrado al que se accede pagando U$10 x auto. Te entregan un mapa donde te muestran los diferentes miradores.

Esta dividido por diferentes paradas que te va indicando el mapa.  Paradores hacia el océano pacifico, que golpea fuerte contra la costa. Sectores de playa rocosas. Cada paisaje es increíble. Es más, seguramente viste la clásica foto del Cipress, es un árbol en medio las rocas de la punta de la península.  Postal característica de la zona.
Paisajes increíbles, hermosas casa.

En este complejo también se encuentra la famosa cancha de golf de pebble beach lugar de varios torneos internacionales.  Sin duda una cancha muy compleja debido a los vientos de la zona.   Uno de sus hoyos esta justo entre la carretera y el mar.

Pero los paisaje de la costa son impresionantes. A pesar de ser un recorrido corto, cada uno ofrece un paisaje diferente.

Ideal para hacerlo con niños, amigos o en pareja. No dejes de conocer este bello lugar. Es muy accesible y te va a sorprender.

Tambien te encontrarás con la arquitectura de la zona, imponentes casas en medio de este bosque verde.  Llama la atención el canto de los pajaros en toda la zona.

Una actividad para hacer en familia es la contrucción de Torres. En una de las primeras paradas encontrarás una playa llena de rocas redondeadas, de color crema.  Construyan en familia la torre más alta que puedan!   Eso si mucho cuidado con los pies. Si alguna roca se resvala puede lastimar un montón.
ESta playa cuenta con mesas y sillas, ideal para hacer una parada en el viaje, un picnic a la orilla del oceano turqueda.<//review>< pics>

<review>(Translated by Google) It is driving the # 17-MileDrive 🚙🌊
This is a great coastal route to drive #PebbleBeach and #PacificGrove along the Pacific coastline of Cali #Monterrey. As the name suggests, this is a place where you can enjoy 17 miles of roads with beautiful natural scenery. If you enter the Pacific Grove Gate on the north side, you can turn the sea to the right, and Navi pointed out HWY Gate 1 on the south. Enter Gate HWY 1 and turn clockwise to find the viewpoint next to the coast. Within 17 miles drive you'll find a total of seven golf clubs and a golf course with their beautiful Pacific views. Open is said to be held.

The ghost trees, which have been shaped by the sea for a long time, and the #TheLoneCypress tree, which has survived 250 years at the edge of the cliff, should not be missed. Don't miss the #BirdRockVistaPoint, where you can see the sea lions and countless birds, and the #PescaderoPoint which is truly fantastic.

📌 Since this is a private property, you will need to pay $ 10.25 toll cash per vehicle.However, if you pay more than $ 35 for food and beverages at #Pebble Beach Resort, the resort staff will pay the tolls at checkout, so make sure you have your receipts. However, the #PebbleBeachMarket with a simple piece of cake, pudding, donuts and drinks, a medium-sized market such as a supermarket, and a souvenir shop will not be refunded if the purchase amount exceeds $ 35.

#17-MileDrive 를 드라이빙하다🚙🌊
이곳은 캘리 #몬터레이 의 태평양 연안의 해안선을 따라 #PebbleBeach 와 #PacificGrove 를 드라이브 할 수 있는 멋진 해안로이다. 이름 그대로 17마일의 도로를 아름다운 자연의 절경과 함께 즐길 수 있는 장소이다. 북쪽에 위치한 퍼시픽그로브 게이트로 들어가면 바다를 오른쪽에 두고 돌 수 있는데, 네비는  남쪽에 있는 HWY 1번 게이트를 알려주었다. HWY 1번 게이트로 들어가면 시계방향으로 돌면서, 해안 옆 뷰포인트를 찾아가며 돌아보면 된다. 17마일 드라이브 안에는 총7개의 골프클럽들과  이들이 자랑하는 아름다운 태평양 뷰와 함께 하는 골프 코스를 볼 수 있는데, 이곳에서만 올해로 6번째 U.S. Open이 개최된다고 한다.

오랜 세월 해풍을 맞아 형태가 제각각인 고스트 트리들과, 절벽 끝에서 외로이 250년을 버텨온 #TheLoneCypress 나무는 놓치지 말아야 할 포인트다. 바다사자와 수많은 새들을 볼 수 있는 #BirdRockVistaPoint 와 태평양 뷰가 정말 환상적인 #PescaderoPoint 를 꼭 챙기시길.

📌이곳은 #사유지 이기 때문에 차량 당 통행료 현금 $10.25을 내고 들어가야 하지만, 참고로 #페블비치리조트 에서 #35불이상 식음료 결제를 하면 계산시 리조트직원이 통행료를 바로 내어주니 영수증을 잘 챙겨야 한다. (게이트에서는 환불안됨) 단, 간단한 조각케익이나 푸딩, 도넛과 음료, 슈퍼와 같은 중형마켓, 기념품점이 입점한 #PebbleBeachMarket 은 구매금액이 35불을 초과해도 환불이 안되니 주의.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPLP_8l77pbXp6MWv3NjFlZXvs_XVaZJmMQm_t=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5w1vth1PEK4FN11Ng9C_9BxB0lP8-RQnMjQ2P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOF1xr1KNbGTCjk5ylIwMBIpsRdzG-O2khZ8q5W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGkneVjIxzKsiyfVtP9jx8wOVSpi8u7xzVqlVi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKiHEdl-djbMJvpbcPwCWB7BbzHItHVrgekrGW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjhbhLdylzBeIbAzIl_9NN4CSN4PLW28if4jj0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCgqgBtVtoB3_oF0IGOyKmiVk63oUWEb9hi9zj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVQDkolqkAij_fabQgcIrxOG3ifNzv2bMkAt0o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCIRZDk0nR4B5PHUg_f3isaWXTYMOJMadEvR9q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqft4YMcLyBss2Qv2r3buGgpo8UZbX1o3S8EFZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOA8zT6xOwrPMTqMsCgihkJyH8aodbHXBByewOT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOtbLBzfRtuMOxjxaHq-A2PXrzU5POxRv-1Jg9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTFGkv9zLri0mxny6YC9nRXf7UY1ovSnMtw1V2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOU53n-HjNLVMTTNmhDki9ls1HCq4vSQ7OoQWGj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHSAgkCXCl6rtaMqI3zWvGQg748mxp2RMXD7Lc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZpUsiWL-3MLzICN34rsNqfWYrj3g780SbGadZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN28YpW7IVXlDZsVyj92kFaNBlEM8B9iHRcmKUj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOkeH4Hun44K0tmZvfmXfzNRDlHkYnvXdO_-Nk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCteyx_PoAdjiow6a0_U9Iep4NTddAoD8inKH9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhicaFA_gv1-J46fWAXgqc2BAhLdcGCetk2Si6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8oy49mj7BOUUb6fm29YOBYqzqTmzolo9jvfa7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0stW7hNEojlDIt8XRFEFk8ZB8rG8NPl1Ub4fV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQ-ppTYuaMI8aoE_I6LaXYKGv8H5uQg83NqtoJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Among them, the 17mile drive gives you the best scenery.
There is a small admission fee, but it is really worth 1 degree
The natural scenery is well preserved, so if you are passing by, I recommend you to stop by. Haha It would be great to come to play golf because there are golf courses and hotels.

You can also see a variety of animals, so bringing your children with you is recommended because it can provide a great experience for children.
Please come unconditionally!

미국 서부해안도로를 통해서 샌프란시스코에서 la까지 가게 되었습니다
그 중 들린 17mile drive는 정말 최고의 풍경을 선사해줍니다
소정의 입장료가 있지만 정말 1도 아깝지 않습니다
자연경관을 잘 보존하고 있기 때문에 주변을 지나가시는 분이라면 무조건 들려보시는 것을 추천드립니다 ㅎㅎ 골프장과 호텔이 존재하기 때문에 골프치러 오시는 것도 정말 좋을 거 같네요

다양한 동물들도 볼 수 있기 때문에 아이들을 데리고 오시는 것도 아이들에게 좋은 경험을 선사해줄 수 있기 때문에 추천드립니다

<Name>K. Franz W.</Name><text>(Translated by Google) A must if ...
... one on the most legendary car routes in the world,
the classic of California Highway 1 is on the way.

We had stayed in Carmel-By-The-Sea on our round trip through California.
Since the famous 17-Mile Drive was only a few kilometers away from our hotel,
we decided to take a look at this panoramic road that we had read and heard about so much.

Also for the sole reason that the "Lone Cypress" (Monterey cypress), which is famous in many photos and is over 250 years old, has become an institution over the years.
can be seen live at "Stop Number 16".

According to literature, it is probably the most photographed tree in the world.

Unimaginable that this wind-blown cypress on the small barren rock ledge directly on the coast
has survived for so long. The "Monterey cypresses" are part of a whole cypress forest, whose special species can only be found in this area

But also the "Ghost Tree" at "Stop number 17",
a dead Monetrey Cypress attracts the attention of many tourists.

It is written that a trip to California is only complete
if you've also taken a ride on the famous 17-Mile Drive.

We liked it and we can unreservedly recommend this beautiful stretch of coast with fantastic views of the sea, beach, rocks, trees, etc.

And so we hereby confirm the following self-promotion:

"One of the most famous scenic drives in the world"
Scenic Road leads you through Pacific Grove and Pebble Beach - a gated community.

(Original)
Ein Muss, wenn…
… man auf den legendärsten Autostrecken der Welt,
den Klassiker der Kalifornien Highway 1 unterwegs ist.

Wir hatten auf unseren Round-Trip, durch Kalifornien in Carmel-By-The-Sea übernachtet.
Da der bekannte 17-Mile Drive nur wenige km von unserem Hotel entfernt war,
haben wir uns entschlossen, diese Panoramastraße von der wir schon soviel gelesen und gehört hatten, uns vor Ort ansehen.

Alleine auch deshalb, um die auf vielen Fotos Berühmte über 250 Jahre alte „Lone Cypress“ (Monterey-Zypresse), welche im Laufe der Jahre zu einer Institution geworden ist,
selber live bei „Stop Nummer 16“ zu sehen.

Gemäß Literatur, ist sie vermutlich der meist fotografierteste Baum der Welt.

Unvorstellbar, das diese windzersauste Zypresse auf dem kleinen kargen Felsvorsprung direkt an der Küste
so lange überlebt hat. Die „Monterey-Zypressen“ sind Teil eines ganzen Zypressenwaldes, deren spezielle Art nur in dieser Umgebung zu finden ist

Aber auch der „Ghost Tree“ bei „Stop Nummer 17“,
eine abgestorbene Monetrey Cypress zieht die Blicke vieler Touristen auf sich.

Es wird geschrieben, dass eine Reise nach Kalifornien nur vollständig ist,
wenn man auch eine Fahrt auf dem berühmten 17-Mile Drive (27 km) gemacht hat.

Uns hat es gefallen und wir können hiermit diesen schönen Küstenabschnitt, bei dem man fantastische Blicke auf Meer, Strand, Felsen, Bäume etc. hat, uneingeschränkt weiterempfehlen.

Und somit bestätigen wir hiermit folgende Eigenwerbung:

„One of the most famous scenic drives in the world“
Die Scenic Road führt einen auf ihrer Runde durch Pacific Grove und Pebble Beach – eine Gated Community.< /text><gmapID>0x808de6d5c86dd76f:0x52ac30a327f8632a<//gmapID></record>

(Translated by Google) Superb!

This road is very pretty, and offers magnificent views, from which we can observe various birds, seals, otters, ancient cypresses, the Pacific Ocean
The view must be even better under bright sunshine, but we did not have that chance.
We would obviously prefer not to have to pay $ 10 per car, but we could say that they are worth it.

On préférerait évidemment ne pas avoir à payer ces 10$ par voiture, mais on pourrait dire qu'ils en valent la peine.<//Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) The entrance fee is worth every dollar. There are plenty of stopping opportunities to take pictures. At the entrance you get a card, so you can find your way around. In addition, the way to the starting point is described by the staff when paying.
It lends itself to the 17 mile drive from north to south, because it makes it easier to enter the parking bays directly on the sea.
You can build this attraction perfectly in the road trip along Highway 1.
The entrance is a bit poorly signposted in Monterey, so it's not that easy to find. Because of this, there is a star deduction.
In the park itself everything is well signposted and there are information boards at the respective stops.

(Original)
Der Eintritt in die Anlange ist jeden Dollar wert. Es gibt genügend Möglichkeiten zum Anhalten um Fotos zu machen. Am Eingang bekommt man eine Karte, damit man sich zurecht findet. Außerdem wird einem der Weg zum Startpunkt vom Personal beim Bezahlen geschildert.
Es bietet sich an den 17 Mile Drive von Norden nach Süden zu fahren, denn dadurch ist es einfacher in die Parkbuchten direkt am Meer einzufahren.
Man kann diese Sehenswürdigkeit perfekt in den Roadtrip entlang des Highway 1 einbauen.
Der Eingang ist in Monterey etwas schlecht ausgeschildert, weshalb er nicht ganz so leicht zu finden ist. Aus diesem Grund gibt es einen Stern Abzug.
Im Park selbst ist alles gut ausgeschildert und es gibt Infotafeln an den jeweiligen Stops.< /review><user_id>114681568021250033374< /user_id><resp>None< /resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

Excelentes vistas para la ruta, recomiendo pasar por este camino si vas a hacer la ruta 1 de California. Vale la pena parar y sacar unas fotos, se pueden ver ballenas o lobos marinos. En el camino también vimos ciervos. Hay que pagar un peaje para pasar, pero vale la pena pagarlo< /text>

(Translated by Google) Admission of 10.5 dollars per vehicle!
But it really is worth it. You can spend a few hours on the drive and choose your own stops.
For the price you get many nice places. Later on the journey to the south there are other beaches that are more expensive ... as I said, would go back to the 17 miles drive ;-)

(Original)
Eintritt von 10,5 Dollar pro Fahrzeug!
Doch tatsächlich lohnt es sich. Man kann einige Stunden an dem drive verbringen und kann sich seine Stops selbst aussuchen.
Für den Preis bekommt man viele schöne Stellen geboten. Später auf der Reise gen Süden kommen noch andere Strände, die teurer sind... wie gesagt, würde wieder auf den 17 Meilen drive gehen ;-)<//review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Where mansions, golf courses and the sea meet! Gorgeous gorgeous! At the entrance you have to pay a fee per car and you get a map with the attractions. All are numbered and the guide has an explanation of each one! All very beautiful! On the way we met some deer on the road! Dearest thing !!

(Translated by Google) Nice. The $ 10 for the private road can theoretically be counted in the very expensive restaurants. I renounced it. Of course, there are as many great free attractions on Highway 1 but the 17 Mile Drive is just a cult and worth the short detour.

(Original)
Schon schön. Die 10 Dollar für die private Strasse können theoretisch in den sehr teuren Restaurants angerechnet werden. Ich habe darauf verzichtet. Selbstverständlich gibt es ebensoviele tolle kostenlose Attraktrionen am Highway 1 aber der 17 Mile Drive ist einfach Kult und den kurzen Umweg wert.</review>
