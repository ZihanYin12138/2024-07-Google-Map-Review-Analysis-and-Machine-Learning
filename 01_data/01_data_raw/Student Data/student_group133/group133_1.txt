This was a terrific experience.  The installers Brian, Chris, and Jaun arrived on time each day and got immediately to work.  They completed the entire kitchen refacing in 3 days, and the results are absolutely beautiful.  I can't say how much I love the outcome.  The refacing was completed to better than my expectations.  The beveled glass fronts are amazing and the other cabinetry looks terrific.  I have a new kitchen that is wonderful and a source of absolute pride.<//text>

<Review>I had a salesperson come out to look at my project. He tried to sell me on a “very popular “ tub surround which i thought looked cheap and tacky for a master bathroom. He seemed mad I didn’t want this option. He then had me choose tile and flooring from limited unclear tiny images on a small personal laptop. No discussion of grout color or any detail. I  also needed my cabinets refaced and was shown a choice of 2 faces. I felt like a door to door salesman was in my home as he pulled out a very worn drawer and cabinet sample from a suitcase and did a Vanna White sales pitch complete with hand gestures.

The worst was the high price quote an when I asked about wall color he told me they weren’t a painting company & didn’t paint their projects.

This company was a waste of time to consider. The disinterested salesman left a trail of cheap cologne and did not get my business.</Review>< Pictures>

We had Reborn remodel our master bath. From the design and planning, through demolition and installation, there were excellent- knowledgeable and professional.
The crew of: David A, Michael N, and Blake L, were knowledgeable, skilled, and very sensitive to be in our home. They were polite and courteous.
The project covered 2 days and they cleaned up after day 1 like it was the final day.
The work is so good, they will come back and do our guest bathroom:<//text>

I used Reborn Cabinets for its online rating.  On the day of the start, I met Brian & Chris.  They were polite, told me how the three days would go, and they would clean up.  Their work was impeccable; they finished in three days, and clean up was fantastic.  My kitchen came out beautiful.  I am planning to use Reborn again for my 2 bathrooms early next year.<//review>

What a terrible experience having Reborn Cabinets reface our kitchen cabinets. Their prices are through the roof, which I figured was due to exceptional quality. I was wrong. We have had to have them redo the entire job, and since that, we have had additional problems with doors falling off due to the screws being too short, the soft close hinges have also fallen off at least 3 times. I was really counting on having a no hassle kitchen remodel with Reborn Cabinets, but it has only been a nightmare! Look elsewhere to save money and get a better product and service!< /review>

David and Anthony did our kitchen cabinet reface. They were both extremely polite and professional. They always made sure that the work space was clean before they left and communicated quickly and effectively to any questions I had. Can’t say enough about how impressed I was by their professionalism.< /review>

What a great experience. The salesman was nice and was clear in explaining that this is a family business. The office support staff were nice and phone calls were prompt and on time. Any changes to schedule were easily handled. The installers were very nice and respectful of our time and apartment. Marco. A. Guzman was the head installer and did a fantastic job. I recommend this company to anyone that want an amazing kitchen upgrade. Nothing but positive vibes here, Thanks Reborn Cabinets INC!!!<//review>

Alex Woods and David Marzical transformed our master bath shower in one day.  They changed out a 43 year old boring tile shower into an exciting smooth sided shower with a seat and a rain head fixture.  The workmanship is excellent.  The whole project went smoothly and we are pleased.< /review>

Bathroom cabinet refacing was completed on time as promised.  One of  the drawers was too shallow to allow for my moisturizer,  so they measured and returned with a drawer of the proper depth the following week.  Bathroom now looks and functions great.</review>

In April I chose Reborn Cabinets for my Kitchen remodel project. And... I am so happy I did!

The Reborn Team In San Diego was Fantastic!

From Shawn in the showroom to the Design Consultants Dave and Cameron , to the Cabinet Pros Brian and Jeremy.  All aspects of the job were above and beyond expectations.

I could not have asked for a more on schedule, Friendly, and Courteous group of construction Professionals!

I highly recommend Reborn Cabinets to anyone looking for the Best Value in Quality and Service.<//Text>

Gary Stella came over to fix  cabinet damage done by an appliance install and crown moulding . He was prompt and fixed the moulding perfectly. He'll be returning to fix the cabinet after parts are ordered .  Very friendly and gets the job done properly. Wish there were more installers like him.</text>

The Reborn team turned my kitchen from obstacles to accessibility. I am a disable veteran. I was unable to fully use the storage space below my counters. John the salesperson recommended drawers instead of doors under the counters. Now I have 250 percent more storage space with easy access. The installers Marcos and Kyle attention to detail is impressive. Their workmanship turn an eye sore kitchen to an idea, beautiful kitchen that I am proud of. Thank-you, Reborn.

Gary Stella came to make repairs on my cabinets.  Gary does very good work and is very pleasant and professional to work with.  Gary does good work yet he is not responsible for Reborn's products and not having products with him because they were not given to him.  Reborn needs to get things right.</Review>

<Review>We had a very nice rep from Reborn come out and give us a quote on a kitchen cabinet reface. After having to watch a video and spending about 40 minutes listening to a sales pitch we were more than ready to just get the quote. For 112 sq ft of cabinet space Reborn wanted to charge $9500 for a laminate door reface. Ouch!!  Just provide a high quality product at a competitive price and STOP THE SALES SHOW!</Review>< pictures>

There are three installers: David M., Brian V.S and Jeremy V. came to our home to renew our old kitchen cabinet and they have done an excellent job.  These three gentlemen are very professional.  During all three days of working on the project, they are very articulate and pay attention to the details.  We were very happy with the results.< /text>

I was totally impressed with how Reborn handled the bathroom shelf repair we needed.  Both the manager I spoke with to set up the repair and the technician (Chris Martinez) who fixed the problem were great.  I would not hesitate to go back to Reborn when we need more home renovation.< /text>

<text>I was so incredibly thankful for Chris Martinez and his help in getting both my master bath and guest bath showers back to working order in record time.

I'd been renting my home for the last three years and after moving back in I discovered my shelves and curtain rod were falling down in my guest shower and both showers had serious water deposit damage to the spouts, making my master bath shower completely unusable.

Chris came out to my home not once, but TWICE and his work was always outstanding.  I'm so thankful for the warranty protection on my bathrooms and even more grateful for the fantastic staff on hand!</text></record>

We are very happy with our new shower!  We received three bids, and Reborn offered the best price for a high quality product. We were happy with everyone with whom we interacted, starting with our sales person and ending  with Roland and Hector, who were our installers. Roland and Hector were professional, prompt, knowledgeable and thorough in their work. We could not be happier with our tub to shower conversion!  Thank you.</text>

We decided to have our shower redesigned and selected Reborn Bath as the installer.  The installation was scheduled for installation on May 6th.  The installers, Caleb and Juan arrived on the dot.  They called us in to make decisions on accessory placement (handrail, shelves, soap dish).  Upon completion (only 5 1/2 hours later) they thoroughly cleaned up.  I even got some drywall texturing advice from Juan.  The finished result was stunning--my wife made that bathroom off-limits for me!  We were very happy with results.< /Review>

Designer Robert "Rob" Hikel is a true professional. I was extremely impressed with his honesty and integrity. He answered all my questions and when I asked a question he did not immediately know the answer to he said so, but then he took immediate action to get my questions answered. Reborn Cabinets can be proud to have an employee like Rob!</Text>

Don't even try to contact these guys. I reached out for an inquiry, now I get called 3 times a day from their sales team. I've blocked their number yet they keep leaving me messages. I'd prefer not to work with a  company so desperate for business. Their initial quote and consultation info was not on par with other quotes I received. There are many better contractors that do this work. I can't even begin to imagine what a nightmare it would be to work with Reborn on a remodel. Save yourself the hassle and go to another company.<//review>

Recently had our kitchen and bathroom cabinets refaced with Reborn. Reborn's sales manager (David D.) made the process of selecting cabinet type, color, and accessories very easy. He also provided great suggestions for our new sink, and even the new major appliances we would be purchasing. The installers (David M. & Brian V.) did a great job during the demo and installation process, including cleanup daily. David M. was always very receptive to our questions and provided us feedback throughout the process. Any minor issues that came up were immediately addressed by the Project Manager (Rick H.), who was able to keep the project on track and pretty much within the timeline for completion. We are happy with the results and Reborn's professional team. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to upgrade and enhance the look of their kitchen or bath.<//Text>

I had a in home estimate from this company and they will not stop calling me from scam numbers. Save your time and sanity and do not give any personal information to these people. They will harass you constantly after your estimate if you decide not to go with them. It's been over a year and they are still calling me every other day from a scam number.</review>

I was fortunate enough to have David Marizcal, Brian VanSlyke, and Ernesto Arroyo install my new kitchen and I cannot say enough about the fantastic job they did. They were very professional in all ways, respectful, polite, extremely clean while doing their jobs and the quality of their work was. Perfect. I do hope that Reborn recognizes their hard work.

Reborn Bath Solution workers came the first day and removed our old shower and prepared the area for install in about five hours.  All debris was removed and hauled away.

The second day, Rudy Z. and Saul P. worked a 11 hour day to install our Kohler Luxstone shower in one day.  These Reborn workers were very professional, courteous, hard working, and diligent.  They didn’t even take a lunch break.  Rudy briefed me at each stage of the installation process to ensure I would be a HAPPY customer.  Rudy and Saul are AWESOME!  Our Kohler Luxstone shower is beautiful!

Thank you Reborn Bath Solution!< /review>

Jody Brown showed up, on time as expected. The office error sent him with a white shelf for our shower, which is beige, but he carefully removed our broken shelves, recaulked areas needing it and carefully repaired everything.
Thanks for doing a great job!<//Text>

I was  very pleased with my initial consultation with Brandon Varga.  With my  shower  being in wretched circumstance, I was treated with respect and not treated as if I were a product  conjoined WITH  my circumstance. This respect given to my circumstance was an   agreemement focused on the ability of this family owned  company (since 1983) that  he represented, to take care of my needs, regardless of how these events of my shower demise came to pass.  His comment, "it smells clean", almost brought tears  of joy to my eyes.....  Because the visual  of the shower delemia was enough to make anyone visually  associate that  foulness of smell would have went with with territory. In other words, I wasn't NASTY! (smile)...  He spent valued time informing me of the history of the company, not a a "sales pich", but for the purpose of being fully informed of the commitment to quality for a "home". I was assured that this company  would treay MY home as if it was THEIR home..... Brandon's  presentation was  only for the purpose of being FULLY informed whether or not I was to use his company.  It was a NO PRESSURE metting, which I felt comfortable all the way through with all of my questions being answered!  And the offer to PRICE MATCH with an additional $100.00, invited me to search for competetive prcing.  Must I say, that the  company ethical standard  and the 25 year warranty on labor and the  additional lifetime waranty was wonderful.  Along with  the $1500.00 dollar free shower door, having a 10 year warranty, relieved a lot of post installation stress!  It was a pleasure signing up with this trusted company.  When Brandon Varga  left, I felt like a valued human being who wad repairing the ills in my life to move forward. He did not try to convince me  put new wine in old wineskins, but a solution to get rid of the old, from the tearing out of  that old 1973 original  application, to replacing outdated  plumbing fixtures to  conform with the new standard of living. And being a Sam's Club Member, I got an UNEXPECTED discount.  And ironically, Sam's happens to be one of my VERY favorite stores!!!!   Affarmation (smile) ....I could go on and on and on!  I can bet that the Reborn staff are as humane as Brandon, who doesn't inflict shame, of circumstance. And the firm handshake at the end of our meeting made me feel human again instead of like  a sudstandard person "trapped"  in a substandard enviornment .  I look forward to the installation.< /text>

Great studio and wonderful teachers who want you to better your practice.  It is an intense workout- but you feel so good about yourself when you are done.  The owner has done a wonderful job in communicating about classes and schedules during these stressful times.<//text>

It’s always intimidating to find anew studio and challenging to learn a new practice but the teachers here could not of been more supportive and helpful. Every teacher offers a different class experience but they all have the core values of providing a space that is fun, challenging, rewarding and accepting of your personal body and energy that day. The studio is so so clean, they are always doing fun challenges to keep things interesting and offer a great array of class times. Couldn’t recommend them more- for beginners to advanced and everywhere in between.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I originally started Hot Yoga to improve my flexibility and my surfing.  It definitely help in both areas.  I just completed a 21 day challenge and I committed to 5 classes per week for three weeks. Feeling much stronger after the challenge.  Thank you to all the GREAT instructors at Bikram Hot Yoga Long Beach.<//Text>

Really nice amenities such as providing yoga mats and yoga towels, in addition to eucalyptus towels and a mini massage at the end of class.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Best studio in the nation by far. As someone who has practiced for 15 years in 22 studios nationwide, I have not seen a studio as warm, friendly, clean, and professional as Bikram Hot Yoga Long Beach. Love the studio and it's beautiful loving energy and community.< /Text>

Being new to hot yoga, I find the practices challenging.  I leave encouraged and proud when I am finally able to improve upon a pose.  Each class challenges me to do better. Staff always professional, studio clean.  Instructors are friendly, nice.  Absolutely love that I joined.</Text>

The instruction and atmosphere were awesome. It was my first time doing hot yoga; it was a rigorous workout but you’re able to go at your own pace. I felt amazing afterward and my skin glowed. I’ll be returning.< /Review>

The best. Been practicing here since 10/30 and LOVE everything about this wonderful and supportive community. Caring and attentive instructors. Great variety of classes. Peaceful location and setting. So glad I committed to making this great form of exercise my "fifth food group" ... it has transformed me both physically, mentally, and spiritually. These classes have become the most integral part of my week!<//Text>

The instructor was so nice and knowledgeable. She noticed my mobility disorder and provided me with modifications which I appreciated. The place was also spotless from the bathroom to the studio. I was so sore from my workouts last week, I left without feeling any tension in my body! It was great and I would highly recommend anyone to go!< /review>

<Text>Such an amazing yoga studio in a beautiful, convenient location. Rosa and all the instructors are fantastic and full of heart and kindness. The studio has a very friendly, family-like atmosphere and several different kinds of classes other than the regular 90-minute Bikram classes (hot fusion, hot pilates, etc.) as well. I love going here and am so grateful to have found this studio, it changed my life.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80dd3027e9b35863:0x127a97c6f3faad87</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I was pretty nervous about my first class, but right when I walked in everyone was super friendly and positive. It's been more than 12 years since my last yoga class and I'm definitely out of shape, but I felt encouraged by the instructors and other students. It's only been a couple of classes, but I can already feel my body changing! The classes are challenging and very rewarding! I'm literally recommending Hot Yoga to everyone I know!

Pro-tip: drink lots of water and fluids electrolytes and bring a towel 'cause you're gonna sweat!</Review>

After I've challenged myself at Bikram Hot Yoga Long Beach I walk outside and am cooled off by the breezes along the calm waterways of the harbor.  I love that moment of sweat mixed with the salty air.  As I walk back to my car I remind myself of the motivation and strength the teacher's have just shared with me.  This studio offers a secluded place to practice and workshops that enlighten my soul.  I'm glad I found Bikram Hot Yoga Long Beach.</Review>

Not the best experience. As soon as I entered into class a class attendee aggressively told me that I couldn't put my mat near a vent which caused a scene and made the remainder of the class a not-so-great experience. I then moved near the door and the instructor moved me a second time which made me uncomfortable because it's not where I felt the best energy. The class was just way too crowded. I probably will not go back. I found a yoga studio across the street and the room was much more spacious and the people a lot more friendly.<//text>

{'time': 1499787442512, 'text': "Danni, I'm so sorry to hear your experience was not great. As a community we hold our yoga room to be sacred space for everyone. I don't know which students or teacher you are referring too. Typically in a large class a teacher may ask students to adjust mats so that all students can see themselves in the mirror. (Being able to see yourself is a huge part of the yoga in the Bikram sequence) We do hope you come back and give it another go. It is amazing, healing yoga. There are classes which are less crowded- please feel free to email me at info@bikramhotyogalb.com and I would be Happy to discuss more with you. Thanks."}< /Resp>

Range of classes, knowledgeable and passionate teachers, early morning and late evening classes.  Love the new Pilates mat class and the 1-hour long hot yoga options.</review>

<Text>I like the teachers I have had at BHYLB, some are all-time favorites, and the hot room doesn't smell stinky or mildew-y 😁 it's easy to check in and get situated, there's plenty of space for your bag/gear. The bathroom in the room was odd to me at first, but now the small corner it makes is my go-to spot. I also have photosensitivity and really appreciate that some of the teachers turn off or dim the overhead fluorescents once we move to the floor postures. It's quickly become my favorite hot yoga studio in long beach!!<//Text>< Pics>

They provided timely progress information and service.  I highly recommend their services.  From dropping the  car off, till the repair was completed and the car was picked up, they provided nothing but excellent service.< /Text><user>112767776146580062169<//user>< Resp>

<review>Recommended by my insurance and was a clean establishment, very professional and friendly, and they were easy to use. About 30 minutes for an estimate. They communicated with me wonderfully and also my insurance directly. I would recommend from my experience so far but the actual repairs themself haven't been done so my experience is limited< /review>< Pics>

These guys know their business. Had my car in and out after only 2 days and it looked brand new. Great communication leading up to drop off and pick up, and they even shuttle you to your rental car location.</Review>

Repair of 2017 Subaru Legacy after collision into my drivers front wheel. The vehicle was not drivable and looked like it would be “totaled”.
Then Hild Collision Center worked their “magic “ on it. They were professional, complete, and kept  me informed. My auto was brought back to “show room” condition. Thank you Hild</Review>

Working with Hilds on every level is top notch. From the welcoming receptionist and my service advisor Greg. Keeping me notified of progress and completion. Car was ready for pick up when I arrived at 8:00am. We’ve had work done here many times and referred many people to Hilds!! Never disappointing!! Hands down, best place in town!!

This is the second time in the past years that another vehicle has collided with a car I own. And this is my second repair with Hild.  The repair appears to be flawless.  Mr. Wyatt, the Hild rep that handled my repair was very helpful with assuring that I knew how the process worked.  As a bonus, it was completed a couple of weeks faster than I had anticipated.  I hope this is my last repair from an accident.  But if there is another, I will be back at Hild.  Great people.  Perfect repair.</text>

I told my adjuster as long as I had it by the filling Monday at closing I would be fine for I had a Tuesday appointment. He assured me that would work. It is Monday and I have called as I had not heard from them. This time he said it should be done by sometime tomorrow, which is Tuesday. He said he could never have guaranteed the time, because he wouldn’t have known. I could’ve rented a car to make sure that this wasn’t going to be an issue.   I’m am extremely  disappointed with the broken promise of assurance, and no calls to give me warning, especially since I talked to me about it did not get a rental car due to his assurance.< /review><UserId.>108073336950823183626</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

First of all I have to give mention to Steve Wyatt. He was wonderful. The customer service and communication he provided was exceptional. He took care of all the details, assured me he would handle everything with the insurance company and he absolutely did. I never worried about a thing. He was just so pleasant to talk to. He treated me with respect and made sure my car was repaired with the best possible results. Thanks so much for Steve Wyatt!

Secondly my car looks so beautiful. I want to thank Hild for doing a superior job, even the inside was cleaned. Thanks also to Jason for pointing out things I never would have noticed...honesty, good communication and excellent service makes Hild my go to shop. Thanks everyone!!<//Review>

I've had several experiences with Hild Collision oh, and I will not go anywhere else! The staff, amazing customer service, and that means everything to me when I walk in. I've been in Redding on and off for seven years and the only person I refer to when someone needs their car fixed painted worked on or otherwise is Hild Collision!</Text>

I am a total perfectionist when it comes to vehicles, so I had major anxiety over how the repair was going to turn out. Hild assured me of the quality of their process, walked me through the facility and how the repair would be done, worked with insurance, and were spot on with the timeframe and delivery back to me. I was apprehensive when I went to pick up the vehicle and inspected it closely. The repairs by hild were nothing short of absolute perfection. They restored the truck to complete perfection. I was absolutely stunned at what an amazing job. The truck is even a special order color and the match is flawless. Unbelievable work. I interviewed all the shops in town, hild is the best. Glad I went out of my insurers “network” and went to hild. Start to finish, a 5 star experience for sure.  Don’t even waste your time, just go to hild.<//Text>< Pics>

I can’t express how happy I am with Hild collision Center. I have worked in the automotive industry before and I worked with another collision center in town but I would hands down choose Hild every time. From the moment you walk through the door they make you feel at ease, they are timely, efficient, detail oriented, and professional from start to finish. I had the pleaser of working with Steve Wyatt and he was nothing short of amazing, he kept me up to date with my car and the repairs, he gave me a time frame of when my car would be completed and he nailed it to the exact day and time. He is one of the most patient people I’ve met and anytime I called he never made me feel like I was bothering him. Although I don’t hope to have to use them again I know that if I needed them they would be there for me. They truly care about their customers!< /text>

We were treated kindly and professionally throughout the entire repair. They followed through with every aspect of the repair (estimated time it would take correctly, called to let us know how it was going, were kind and courteous when we called).We were very happy with the repair as well as noticed the extra bonus of a door ding they touched up with the matching paint from the repair of the roof. Would have no hesitation being a return customer or highly recommending to someone else.,<//text>

From the very beginning, Steve kept in touch with me to let me know exactly what was going on with my vehicle.  When it left the body shop, I was informed it was going to painting. I got texts for alerts and I also got personal phone calls from Steve. My car was completed one week sooner than expected. It looks great and I am very pleased with this company.</Text>

<Text>The quality of the work performed was second to none. All concerns about the job were addressed in the beginning before signing the authorization for work.

Customer service from the entire staff was awesome. No needs were left unaddressed.

I've used Hild Collision Center several times in the last 8 years due to wild critters going bump in the dark on our narrow winding mountain roads. I've never been disappointed with their excellent work "face lifts" on any of my vehicles.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x54d2ecadcbfce5fd:0xaa2e5eb062619c0e< /gmapID></record>

I want to thank Steve Wilson. He went above and beyond to fix my husband’s truck. It came out beautiful. I will never go any place else to have repairs on my vehicles. Hild Collection Center is the best.< /review>

They totally erased the noticeable dent and scratches on the panel over my rear passenger tire.  It’s as if it never occurred and looks brand new.  Returned car in better condition in what looks to be a complementary detail job.<//review>

<Review>I have had the most generous compassion and respect from Heild Collison during my repairs to my car. Steve Wilson is by far the man you want to see and help with your repairs.  Steve went above and beyond his job to help me with my claim through the process. He did more for me than my insurance company (which I will be canceling).  I
recommend Heild and Steve Wilson for any and all your repairs.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

They did great body and paintwork on my car. It was done in a professional and timely manner. They always kept me informed on the progress of the work. They also to my surprise cleaned my car inside and out! I left several items of value in my car and they are all still there. They even found money and a necklace that I forgot in my car! They are very good at there work and very honest. I highly recommend this company.< /review>

It took an excessive amount of time. I was told it would be done the first week of the year. They finally finished it on the 18th of January. The door is still not sealed will have to go back and see if it is just an adjustment.< /review>

I dropped my car off after hours on a Sunday night (due to work schedule) car was filthy because I just returned from a fifteen hundred mile trip to Idaho. Car repair was done on time and was clean. Repair was undetectable. Hild does excellent work and goes above and beyond. Thank you to all employees at Hild.< /Text>

Steve is the most professional person I’ve come across in Redding. He was very helpful and kept us in the loop the entire time and even added things on that he didn’t need to. I can’t recommend this place enough. Our window was fixed quicker than expected and it looks fantastic.<//Text>

As always the guys and gals at Hild took amazing care of our family! Their sincerity and attention to detail starts when you are greeted to when you pick up your repaired vehicle clean and in perfect condition.

I will always recommend them to anyone who needs any type of collision repair!<//review>

I recently had my truck damaged by hail during a spring storm in Redding.  After looking at damage and getting a referral from a friend I chose Hild Collision Center for my repairs.  I met with Estimator Steven Wyatt and he assured  me that my truck would look like new again.  Well all I can say is I am very pleased with this business.  Very professional!  Steven kept me notified all through the process.   They were very quick and thorough.  Office staff was great, polite and courteous.   I would recommend  this repair  center to anyone!</review>

< Review>
I recently had some front end damage repaired at Hild.  I was extremely impressed that they went above and beyond what I expected.  The repair work was seamless, all the employees I communicated with were friendly and welcoming, the work was done when they said it would be, and when I picked my van up they had washed the exterior as well as detailed the interior.  The van was cleaner than when I dropped it off.  For a busy mom of 4 that was truly appreciated.  Thank you Hild Collision Center!</Review>

The person who answered the phone was fairly professional until I pointed out that their quote was $200 more than the 4 other shops I called. He was like proud that they are over priced or something. Definitely would be more apologetic about the rate if it's higher than everyone else's.< /text>

<review>I just had the best experience at Hild Collision Center.   My car was vandalized and I had to take it in for a repair.   From the time I got there they all treated me so well.   This was all a combined effort from my insurance State Farm, Hild and Hertz.   They all worked together so well.   I took the car into Hild, I was met there with my rental car and I was off.   The repair on my car was perfect and they detailed it inside and out.   Way more than I expected.  Then I went there with the rental car full of gas and exchanged it for my car.   Signed a couple pieces of paper and off I went.   Minimal time had to be invested in all of this.   So thanks for doing such an amazing job!!!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

My car is over 15 years old and needed a new bumper, which was not easy to find, but they diligently looked around the US until they located one that matched to help maintain the future collector value of my car. In addition, they detailed the car before it was returned to me and it looked fantastic!</text>< pictures>

I just had the best experience at Hild Collision Center.   My car was vandalized and I had to take it in for a repair.   From the time I got there they all treated me so well.   This was all a combined effort from my insurance State Farm, Hild and Hertz.   They all worked together so well.   I took the car into Hild, I was met there with my rental car and I was off.   The repair on my car was perfect and they detailed it inside and out.   Way more than I expected.  Then I went there with the rental car full of gas and exchanged it for my car.   Signed a couple pieces of paper and off I went.   Minimal time had to be invested in all of this.   So thanks for doing such an amazing job!!!<//Review>

<text>My car was hit and my front passenger side bumper, fender, and wheel cover was all messed up!!! I was so sad because I had just paid ot off and was very sad! I just picked up my car today and it looks brand new! They also made everything so easy, even down to returning my rental!

Thank you Hild!!!< /text>< Rate>

Very friendly staff that was very attentive to assisting me with getting my car back to looking like new after massive hail damage. Only three stars because I did have to go back several times after I found damage to my vehicle that was not there when I brought it in.</text>

<GmapID>0x54d2ecadcbfce5fd:0xaa2e5eb062619c0e<//GmapID><Review>Don't expect your vehicle to be in one piece if your insurance decides to total your vehicle; Hild will do whatever they please once they've been notified insurance won't pay for the repairs.  Though my car had a simple shattered grate and a slight dent in the front of the hood, the radiator magically broke and the hood started spontaneously bending more, all while the car was in their "care"; goodness, how did that happen?  Not to mention, expect opposition if you decide to retrieve it instead of allowing insurance to tow it away, they'll hold spite for the customer taking whatever little money they can get out of their grasp.  Their communication punctuality is laughable at best, as it took half a month to even notify me about my repair total DOUBLING the original estimation (I can only dread they were responsible for the radiator and further hood damage, but considering these happened after I left it in their shop, little evidence is needed to prove otherwise).  This process took almost 2 months to get finished, my only mistake was taking my problems to a scammer first when I could have repaired the issues in my own garage for 1/4 of the price.  Good to see the car's back up and going strong, saving it from Hild trying to put it in an early grave.<//Review>< Time>

<Review>It is never easy to suffer loss from an accident or vehicle break in as happened to us recently, but it is so good to know that the people at Hild will come along side to put things back together for you.  Professional and knowledgable, they work with you to keep your costs down and satisfy all the insurance requirements.  In the end the colors match, the job looks like uou never had a problem. Thank you Steve Wyatt and crew.<//Review>< response>

<Text>In January my mom and I were just leaving Taco Bell when we were rear-ended at a stop light. We exchanged information with the driver of the other car and shortly thereafter we were in need of some body repairs on my mom's Chevy S-10 pickup and the first place I called was Hild Collision Center after doing some research on line, boy am I glad I did because not only are they good, they check for any possible problem that might not be seen unless it's checked thoroughly.... They found damage to the bed of the pickup that we weren't aware of.... I found the experience I had at Hild Collision Center was exemplary in courtesy, knowledge and experience I would recommend them to anyone that needs autobody repair!! 💓💓</Text><user_name>Nanette Hatfield< /user_name><rate>5</rate>< Time>

My jeep compass went there for repair work through insurance (needed the front passenger side repaired) and at times of pick up my jeep wasn't finished window seal wasn't in properly, plastic for door wasn't completely fastened, the grill was missing hardware, now has extra scratches all the way around the body, extra parts were left in the car. They seemed very professional but I don't feel my vehicle was properly taken care of</Review>

Best customer service. My car was very damaged and they were able to fix it promptly and it looks just as new as when I bought it off the lot. I highly recommend Hild Collision.<//Text>

I had a dent and, instead of making us pay a thousand or so dollars, they referred us to someone who could take it out for much cheaper. Good business.<//text>

These guys rock! Had a bad experience  with Miller Auto.  They messed up my paint job and didn't want to fix it, so I took  it to Hild. . They fixed it fast and for free. 10 stars!!!</review>

<Review>They have horrible customer service. Recently purchased countertop oven but it was defected.
Called manufacturer but it was more complicated, instead returned oven for replacement.  So far over 3weeks ,no other information but "return created". Rush taking money from bank and be careless afterwards. So disappointed.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

It’s nearly 2020 & their exchange policy is still living in the year 2000. What a frustrating customer service experience. There are stores with the same products & a significantly more reasonable exchange policy where I will be taking my business from
Now on.< /Text>

<Gmap_id>0x80c34a1a3b2df079:0xf6deae37e8c9cc29<//Gmap_id><Review>I absolutely love Williams Sonoma. This particular location made me feel like they thought I was going to steal something! I was there because I was ready to shop BIG! I had a few things in mind that I wanted to check in person and take them home. I was approached a total of five times by three different people. I was carrying two items that weren't high priced and they asked if they could hold them for me❓❓❓ really? Fine, I gave up the items because I was NOT trying to steal, and continued looking through the store. I was approached another two times by the same people. Listen, if I needed help, I'd ask for it. They made me feel super uncomfortable, so I purchased the two things they were already holding for me and left. I was ready to purchase a 6qt kitchen aid mixer and a Le creuset bundle but, in case they work on commission, I didn't. So disappointing.</Review>< username>

<Gmap_id>0x80c34a1a3b2df079:0xf6deae37e8c9cc29</Gmap_id><text>I don't recommend this particular store. I tried to make a return for a holiday gift and feel like I was minimally helped, if not lied to, by manager, Stacy.
I brought in a gift receipt given with a gift, which turned out not to be associated with the gift itself. I told Stacy I was sure the gift was purchased that day in store. She looked in her system and said it was not. After speaking to the gift giver, I learned it was ordered IN STORE by an associate and mailed to the house. Having left the store, I called Stacy to tell her it was order in store by an associate. She said she DOES have that receipt in house but would have had to check a different system. She kept calling it an online order even though it was placed IN HER STORE. I felt very frustrated because she kept blaming me for not knowing this is how it was purchased when every consumer would consider any instance where you give a cashier your credit card as an in store purchase. I believe Stacy should have known (and did know) that she should check this other system but chose not to. If I must shop at Williams Sonoma in the future, I will do it online or at another location.< /text>< userid>

<text>Thanks and much appreciation to sales associate Pam at the Victoria Gardens store.  She went out of her way to help me as I was coming to this location shortly after arriving from Northern California to pick up a large gift item for a local family event.  By phone, another associate helped me find the store location within the Victoria Gardens complex when I was having trouble.  The large box was gift-wrapped for me.  It was an exceptionally pleasant experience.< /text>< pictures>

<text>I came in to my local William Sonoma location to exchange a Christmas gift for store credit, as it was an appliance I already own. The employees were unable to accept my exchange for credit without a receipt, even though the product was unopened in its original packaging with the William Sonoma barcode & price tag clearly attached. It’s so frustrating when you can walk in to any other store in the mall and exchanges are an absolute breeze, but a store as big as William Sonoma doesn’t have the technology to process such a simple transaction. I will be doing any future home goods shopping at a location that is more reasonable in their exchange policy.</text>< pics>

Chain kitchen equipment store. Good variety of kitchen gear.  Some tableware. Also, sells spices, mixes, sauces and other ingredients. Good quality equipment, but can be pricy.  The sales staff are helpful and friendly.<//text>

There are so many things you never you existed.  It was also really nice that they wrapped the gift for me right after I bought it.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  They stopped and asked my wife and I if we found what we were looking for and asked to help us.  I must say that the products are on the higher end so plan accordingly.  Only time will tell if they withstand the test of actual use.  Overall, it is a good store and purchasing items was a good experience.< /review>< Response>

It's a great place to shop if you want to spice up your kitchen. They are a little pricey, but that's expected for amazing quality.</review>

Extremely disappointed in the return policy. Tried to return an unopened Christmas present with the price tag still on it but because I didn’t have a receipt they wouldn’t accept the return. Not even for store credit. Seriously?!<//text>

We were attended by Associate #33815. I wish we would have remembered her name.  She was very nice, helpful, and knowledgable for products we were interested in.  She loved her job and made us long term customers.  I would recommend this place.<//Review>

< Review>
Did not tell me it would take 2 months + to get the toaster.  It was suppose to arrive in 5 - 7 days. Called the customer service number twice, waited 10 -15 min to talk to someone  but to no avail.  Since I paid with gift card and cash, they didn't know how to give me a refund because I deleted an email on the day I bought it.  They do not have the info.  Not a good experience.  They offered me a discount on a second toaster so I could have one for my guests when they arrived.  Not a grest solution either.
Their team worked to get the toaster to me sooner which was nice.</Review>

< Review>
Attempted name change by mail, failed on first attempt.

They DID return the passport, but they lost any record of ever having the application, and they didn't write a note about whether it was successful, a failure, and what the next step was.

There's no tracking number given.
There's no way to track the process online.

It sounds like chaos/incompetence is rampant in this office.</Review>

I’ve tried countless times to call and schedule an appt just like the office says to do and no matter what I’ve done I can’t get through to a representative. I tried to come to the office in person and was told by security the only way to get an appt was to keep trying to call. Don’t say you’re lines are open from 9-4 if you aren’t taking calls.<//Review>

I have always had a pleasant experience with this office and the representatives have always been so helpful and nice. Today I spoke with a very rude individual who spoke to myself and my client in a very degrading and insulting manner. When I asked for her name she told me that she was located in unit 11. When I finished the call and called back to speak with a supervisor I was told that they do not have a unit 11 and that they did not know what I was talking about. I hope that call was recorded for training purposes and they DO NOT follow the way she handled herself. I will be following up.<//text>

My family had just a great experience with this office! Nice building, friendly staff, efficient help! My special thanks go to Ben (I don't know his last name but he gave me his code C10) who helped us a lot with a renewal of our SSN. He was so kind, and smart, and willing to help that I would call him the best clerk I've ever met! He is a perfect role model to other workers! Thank you again Ben! You're the best!</Review>

Redirected over to this office to file my paperwork for a new card. Security was thorough but friendly and helpful. The wait for service was about an hour without an appointment which is reasonable. They had an Express lane for some but I didn't meet the requirements. The gentleman who helped me file my paperwork was efficient and supportive, getting me out the door in less than 5 minutes after talking to him. Overall a good experience with the SSA.</Review>

The door security personnel were very professional,   courteous,  and considerate.  I'm over 65 and was wearing boots that day, I also use a cane. So I could sit down to remove my boots, they offered me a chair. The SS office personnel were even more professional,  courteous and knowledgable. Jason, the person that assisted me, even called my home 3 days later, with information (of which,  I had never even considered), that turned out to be beneficial to me.  When I asked questions, they were very knowledgeable and provided the answers clearly and succinctly. I appreciate all of their effort.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Second time here, both times I had to wait 40 minutes approx., 30 people before me, so, overall a good experience.

First time had to change a letter in a Social Security Card, an "a" for an "e", fast.

Second time, my status changed, so had to switch my Social Security Card for a new one without restrictions, again, fast.

So, can't complain, also the person who attended us was professional and kind.

Just go prepare and with an open mind, everybody's time is valuable.</Review>

The clerk at window 1 sent us away yesterday @ 11:00 a.m., stating we needed a birth certificate to apply for a replacement social security card.  A valid California ID was presented, yet we were still sent away.  The website indicates that birth certificates are not acceptable.  FIRE THIS CLERK</Text>

<text>I was very concerned after reading other review. I'm not sure if they were just going in for a new card as I was. My experience was excellent!  Got there about 9:30 a.m. on a Tuesday , security check went very fast,  did the electronic check in and it gave me my number. Only 3 people before me. Maybe a 10  minute wait. Then about  5 min to complete the process.  My husband and I left in shock at how smoothly it went.<//text>< Pics>

Lots of space and seating. I came in to have a replacement SSN card. The wait time is really bad. They could put in an extra or two employees at work to reduce the wait time, considering there are so many empty desks there.</Text>

Prepare to wait for a very long time. Once you get your number, you will be called in about 15 minutes. There you will give them your name and reason for a visit. Even something so simple as dropping off w-2s requires waiting, and expect at least an hour for that.
This time, you have to wait for your name to be called. Good luck listening for your name. Many of the announcers can barely be heard over the constant him of others waiting and even the louder ones are barely audible.
This all happens at the front office. If you are required to stop in there, plan out a whole day. If you are lucky enough to go to the rear location, plan on about 15 minutes.< /Text>

The card center at his location is pretty good. It only took me 20 minutes from getting a number to completing my business. Of course, I would advise people to come early rather than late to avoid waiting in the lobby for extended period of time. The audio of calling your number is fairly easy to hear.<//review>

I waited in the waiting room the entire time and my number got skipped. They said they called it but never did. Went up to the window and got called a liar because they “called” my number. I was literally arguing with the person.</text>

< Review>
I use a wheelchair and traveling to the location on Folsom Blvd. is a nightmare causing me to use the street as certain areas the driveways are too dangerous to cross. So I try to call and try and try. The general SS number is 3 wasted minutes of auto answer blathering just to finally be told, "You have a 40 minute wait time.”  Calling the local office is a shorter auto answer leading to, "All reps are busy try your call again later"...and the system hangs up on us! 45 minutes of trying to no avail so now with daily painful disabilities including a new painful 'something' wrong with my brain, I have to travel far and dangerously just to ask where is the -Important- letter they said would be sent. Government system fail at its finest worst from no concern for disabled safety to failure to provide actual customer service.<//Review>

The so called security at the entrance are misogynistic and patriarchal. The so called security at the entrance talk down to women and treat women like an inferior. They should train their security guards not to discriminate against women. I'm from Orange County California and I'm also from Los Angeles California, and I've never been treated as badly at a Social Security Office until I came to the Social Security Office on Folsom Blvd. In Sacramento.</text>

System is horribly inefficient. It seems we are treated as if we have done something wrong. I HAD TO WAIT OVER AN HOUR and was then told that I don't have enough documents! It is never clear how many documents I need to bring. Customer service is horrible! The workers are arrogant! If they worked for a private company, the company would soon fail, but hey, this is the government, there's now way they can fail. Wow, I never thought there is something worse than the DMV<//Text>

<Text>Good evening,
My wife and I was upset when we found that my SS deposit was $ 504.00 instead of $1262. The  representative review my record. She explained that my 2014 SS was not paid correctly and SS owed  us $504. Next week on the 19th receiving $ 1262, next month it will increase $ 1290. She took her time and was VERY professional.
Representative took my call very close to 5:00pm wish I remembered her name. Please, manager or lead send or give her notice of a job " WELL DONE".

Sincerely,

Sean M. Kelly< /Text>< pics>

This is the WORST Social Security office ever. It was my experience they looked at me and treated me like I shot their dog! A big ugly mean looking guy spotted me through the glass and I wondered if he was going to come around and kick my butt in a case of mistaken identity. It was my experience these poor people working there acted like THEY'VE ONLY EVER WORKED WITH THIEVES AND FRAUDULENT CRIMINALS who are there to abuse the system. I am scared to death of the place and the poor people who work there to "help" you. Opposite of the Roseville office and "Sue at window two" so to speak.</review>

Horrible customer service. I called in on behalf of my grandmother to see if they had appointment time slots and she refused to give me any information and wanted to speak to my grandmother who doesn't speak English and is hard of hearing. I'm not even asking for anything that would require personal information. Horrible.< /Review>

This is the only Social Security office in Sacramento that allows you to handle business related to your social security number and card, at least that’s What we were told at one of the other Social Security offices.</Review>

<text>So lame!!! I spent 45 minutes on hold while trying to contact this place and I got hung up on once. Finally when i got through I was told this location can help with changing my name on my SS card but once I got there I was told I have to go to another location. Now I have to go to the Folsom location tomorrow. Waste of time seriously especially since I have two little kids with me!!<//text><Rate>1</Rate><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<review>I should have known when I pulled up and didn't see a black face on the advertisement outside that they didn't sell hair! There were no black employees. But I really don't understand because hair is a big business and all Races wear hair.🤔 They do not advertise to blacks obviously, therefore they do not get Black customers. Nor do they care to carry what Black customers like. Point taken! Will not support you Cosmo.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM98d-8uzVoiO6aMb7UGKZvBGFOV0X_nHqD_WzC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Gmap_id>

Very disappointed with the store manager Yvette's attitude, sure she does not act like one. I always go to the store in Downey where I live but this one is close to my business and I decided to go for the first time, but believe me would be the last. How can a company such as big as CosmoProf can hire somebody so unprofessional, unfortunately I was not the only customer complaining about her. A very unhappy customer.< /text>

<text>Amgen hires ppl under false pretenses. They use hiring businesses to do their hiring. Once their 90 day contract is up they let you go. All so they dont have to hire permanently and pay for benefits. So wrong to play with ppls lives like that.</text><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80e8309a59459bbf:0x83592056c93bba44<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great company. I loved their open floor plan and no walls policy. Beautiful settings, very modern furniture, nice outdoors with trees, good pay and nice people. Pretty far to drive to work everyday.< /Text>

<Rate>4< /Rate><text>I remember the 1st time I ate @ a food truck in East Oakland. It was tacos and there were not that many "food trucks" around.  These days there are food trucks that sell everything!  Even Indian food!

Dum is a great food truck that also has a brick and mortar restaurant called Ritu.  Great reasonable prices and small selection of goodies or snacks.  The rotis are my favorite- warm, doughy and chewy with spices.  Wash it down with a sweet mango lassi!   There are 2 staff members that work inside the truck.  Both wearing masks and there are hand sanitizers available. Follow them on social media to find out where the truck will be next!</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhZUefCd50NOCFbLZgus_-i-Uz2tND2VwU8ePk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnXbbE5uXEd4m6yEFVCnD2MnrPD1QLPB9inCyO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAQydAaLIelC63cDrvHEfWWmqLyK7GXsdR0dN3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMP0xguUMBY2e3MLXurRi0cZM90zl7kjLni3ufk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYnTlQWpbpmjJAZFgKmv48--esNI5cX_GWqnCC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPsWF0YP75m_sesnvVenFMQ_aNWMuQAu3WMJx_p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

< Review>
I ordered their At Home Meal Kit and loved it!! The food was as fresh and tasty as the dine-in. I could mix and match easily and enjoy it in different ways  to my liking. It was delivered all the way to RWC on time. The portion was quite large and we made 3 meals out of it.

I ordered two vegetables roasted cauliflower/artichoke/peppers and roasted tofu/onion to be mixed with the korma sauce and enjoyed it as a mix veg korma, tofu korma and roasted veggies by themselves. Also ordered manchurian sauce and forgot to order pakora to go with it.. but it goes great with brown rice or noodles.   Hubby is looking forward to getting chicken, lamb and fish and I want to get the steamed millet next :)

Oh and don't forget to order the side of Mumbai Trail Mix, it goes great with drinks and salads!<//Review>

<Review>This food was so good, I started instantly weeping. I ate beyond the point of satiation and reason. I ate until my soul merged with the tandoori fried chicken and beet ball things and I regretted nothing. I pity every person that rated less than 5 stars because I know that they are not capable of experiencing true joy.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>We love this place! The food here is fabulous. It's always fresh and full of flavor, the atmosphere is casual (and safe during COVID) and the service is exemplary.

Some of our favorites.....the Kale Chaat are just the way we like them - a crisp flaky crust, not doughy or greasy. The Artichoke Pakoras are also light, crispy and delicious. Their Veg Biryani, Jalfrezi and Malai Kofta dishes are savory and delightful. The menu is excellent and they vary it which is something that we really enjoy - trying new dishes each time we order from them.

Also, as vegans that avoid gluten, the chefs are brilliant about putting together a superb menu for us. Because of our restrictions we often feel like we're relegated to a single item on the menu when we order out but this is never the case at Ritu. We always have choices. It's also *super* reassuring to know that we can trust them with our food restrictions.

The prices are fair for the quality of fare and the portions are generous.</Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808f7e47b49b6121:0x1529cfd36e708aa<//gmap_id></record>

<review>Could not believe the price when we checked out getting takeout here $10 for samosas.... worse the food at least today was terrible... spices completely off food is almost inedible. I must assume this to be an exception because I can’t imagine any restaurant could stay open with food like this. I’ve eaten at probably 20 Indian restaurants in SF and this food was easily the worst I’ve had.<//review><username>Dylan Henley</username><rate>1<//rate>< Gmap_id>

I don't go out for Indian food much but friends took me here for Diwali. What a treat. Really fresh food and slow cooked dal. The meats and fish were super tender. I'll take my family when the come to town.  Loved the chicken makhani, dahi poori, and steamed fish. They also have a surprisingly good and diverse wine list (and plenty of good beer)<//Text>

A lively place for Indian food with a contemporary twist! Loved their happy-hour snacks especially the keema-pav burger. The Parathas are nice and crispy! The portions are decent but I would appreciate larger ones. Nevertheless, a great spot to hangout and have some delicious food!<//text>

Food was good, but service was slow. They have a help wanted sign in the window, so we hope the service is faster when they're fully staffed. We'll probably try again when the sign is gone.<//Review>

<review>Food was mostly great, the brunch menu is hit and miss. The overall feel of the service lacks any sense of urgency but the cook was friendly which made up for the awkward server.

The fried tandoori chicken is the shining star.<//review><time>1561870065716< /time>< pictures>

Chicken biriyani was amazing. Perfectly cooked, medium spiced. Generous quantity for the price. Heard the paratha roll is not that great but I am tempted to try out chai poori.<//review>

<text>Exceptional layering of spices compared to average Indian places. It's a real treat for your taste buds if you're a foodie and love savory flavors with just the right amount of heat  Try the lamb biriyani. The quality of the meat was  exceptional, super tender, and spiced just right.<//text><user_name>Guy Fenner</user_name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I really love the ambiance of the restaurant. The decor feels very warm and inviting. The lighting makes me feel that we were in Christmas time.

I love the Dahi Puri, the crispy and tangy combo was really delicious. The crispy kale chaat was also very creative and delicious, basically cleaned the bowl by myself. Another favorite is the veggie korma, which is surprising to me since I love meat. But the curry sauce of the korma was very tasty, I cleaned this bowl again (notice a pattern here?).

The desserts were also amazing! I had a low expectation because the owner said they're not dessert chefs. However, they're really tasty and unique. I'd definitely come back for the pistachio pot de creme.

The Almanac beer that accompanied the meal was delicious too, such a good addition to the already delicious meal.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

The Chicken Tikka Masala was pretty decent, although a bit to oily and low on spicy for my taste. However, the Garlic Nan was cardboard dry and inedible.< /Text>

<rating>4</rating><Review>It's going to be one of my go to places for comfort food.

1. I like the fact that I don't have to compromise on my health or hygiene to eat a good Indian meal in this place. Everything was delicious, hygenic ( at least looked hygenic ), but not loaded with cream or soaked in oil.

2. Multiple Vegetarian and Vegan options. Roasted cauliflower seemed like a hit ( although I did not try it ).

3. My favourite was the 3 Chaat sampler for $15. I thought this was extremely reasonable and offered delicious options to try out multiple dishes without filling yourself up with any one. I clubbed the dahi Puri ( highly recommended ), sprouts and beet chaat. Everything was delicious.

4. We also ordered the chicken. It was delicious, however for those of you looking for authentic butter chicken, this was not the same. It was cooked in pumpkin gravy. I liked it anyway.

The service was good and we had no wait time for a meal on Saturday night. I recommend trying it out.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Recently opened, i had "byriani" that was fresh, hot and very savory with some sort of bean-based side dish. Notably good spices. Costs just a little more than a neighborhood burrito.<//Review>

I didn’t feel too good after eating the crisp kale chaat. The taste was good though but still it was lacking because they didn’t put enough yogurt and chutney in it. It was very dry and not like chaat. While ordering,  I asked the waiter to add pomegranate to it (as was listed in a different chaat which was not gluten free) but he refused and didn’t seem willing to customize.<//text>

Overpriced and not UpTo the Mark. Had the lamb biryani and pistachio dessert. The biriyani was missing most of what you expect, flavor, quality and quantity. The dessert had excessive cardamom, didn't gel well with the pear and kulfi base.

The staff seemed adequately disinterested, took a while to get someone to take the order and get me my change (which they assumed was all tip and made quite a scene). Wouldn't go back, there are a ton of better options.</text>

Food was below par when it comes to quality and flavor. Names sound appealing and it all seems good but there is a great scope of improvement. Also, the price and quantity seem heavily mismatched clubbed with sluggish service. Wouldn't recommend it given the plethora of options available across.</Review>

The food is hands down one of the best tasting Indian food I've had in Bay Area.

Lot of Indian restaurants in Bay Area are scared of using spices because of the audience, but dum achieves this nice balance where anyone can enjoy the true Indian soul food.

The flavors were amazing!! And as an Indian I've had these items in India, what dum served did hit the spots.

We went during sf restaurant week but ordered al a carte, as we wanted to try as many items as we can between the 4 of us. There was a strong consensus among us that food was no doubt delicious, and we all agreed on the balance of favors, just well done.

The place is trendy and service is always with a smile. Chef does take his time, but that little wait is well worth it. It's more of experience rather than simple chow down session.

If you've been let down by tons of typical Indian restaurants in the Bay Area, then do try Dum. They also have truck in the city< /Text>

Had the samosa chaat, pork Kati roll, veg paratha and chicken skewers. All were great but the Kati roll was my favourite. Service was great, the chef also gave us a free taster of the dahi puri and was really friendly.  That plus 2 beers and the bill came to $40 which I felt was very reasonable.  We will be back<//review>

As usual, they did an awesome job! I was completely satisfied with their customer service.  Delia was extremely helpful when displaying the watches to me, she kindly advertised the features of the watch I was interested in. Alejandra was quick pulling up my billing information and she professionally removed the extra links of my watch. They both spoke to me in my preferred language, and were extremely attentive to every customer at the store at the time. 10/10 service!</Review>

<Review>They completely ripped us off! My boyfriend bought me a bracelet for valentine's day, and when i first seen the bracelet my forst reaction was wow they ripped you off you can completely tell the bracelet is fake. They told him it was dipped in rosegold, comes to find out its only rosegold coloring. The first time i wearing it the bracelet breaks, it is so cheap! You guys should be ashamed of your selfs. Karma is a b****!</Review><resp>{'time': 1622751666504, 'text': "Hi Karina, thank you for your feedback.

The customer service here was outstanding. I went in looking for a ring and I came out with not only a ring but a chain and a smile on my face. The sales person Delia was super helpful and knew exactly what type of jewelry I was looking for. 10/10 would recommend.<//Text>

< Review>
Wow! Just wow. The amount of professionalism and depth of product knowledge shown by two employees went above and beyond my expectations. After weeks and countless hours searching for a ring with my soon to be wife, the employees who assisted me, Delia Corona (sales associate) and Gloria Plascencia (store manager). Demonstrated a spectacular work ethic with a charm of friendliness! They made the our selection feel so much more natural, smooth and not feel like a rash decision. I’ve never seen such a bigger smile on my fiancé until she tried on the marvelous products they offered. She finally said yes to the ring of her dreams, thanks to these lovely ladies. They upheld the bar and expectations of what Kevin Jewelers is. Family owned. Located in Plaza Bonita.< /Review>

<Review>I have been a committed they'll Shopper room for at least 20 years. I always walked by Kevin Jewelers like their prices are too good to be true. So last night I decided to go online and look at their reviews and based on the reviews decided to give them a try. I was not disappointed! Neither was my son I walked in looking for a diamond thumb ring and I walked out with a diamond thumb ring within my budget. The financing process was awesome. So awesome that my son walked out with the diamond pendant that he was not looking for. They say change is good goodbye Zell's!</Review>< rate>

The employees at Kevin’s were absolutely amazing. I’ve never been so pleased and secure with my purchase. Noelia was so patient and had so much wisdom. The Manager was so helpful and had great insight and the office girl was so professional and attentive. This was my first time purchasing jewelry and It was a great experience. I will be returning here for any and every future purchase!< /Review>

<Review>Store Manager Andreas was extremely patient and attentive.
He listened to exactly what I was shopping for and what my price range was.  He showed me lots of options, and he did not waste my time showing me options that were excessively beyond my range, which I thought showed his level of professionalism.   He was an outside the box problem solver, and I was extremely happy with my purchase.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Yesterday was my first time shopping at this location and compared to the one in las americas and parkway plaza, this has been the best!!! Amazing customer service from the employees, very friendly and helpful. Sales person Cesar was the best when helping me find what I was looking for, even though he didn’t have the chain I wanted in the store, he started looking in the computer until he found one, taking his customer service skills out of the way to help me! I loved how he wasn’t too pushy to get a sale and was actually concerned about helping me get what was best. Also the cute young lady that was in the computer, I think her name was Jasmine, was super friendly and offered to clean my jewelry while Cesar and I looked for the right chain. Just overall loved my experience at their store and wouldn’t go back to the other ones, thank you so much!</Review>

<text>My first visit was a couple days before Valentine’s day And I purchased a beautiful gold necklace with a cross for my mother. The debit card machine accidentally charged me more than once but the manager Andres offered me a discount for my next purchase and Andres did not want to return my money (715$) even though I showed proof the money was taken out of my account the night of and the next morning when it was posted and not pending. He told me to contact my bank because they have the money still,but my bank told me they don't have the money and to file a claim. Andres wanted me to wait a week to return my money. And over a month later Kevins jewelers has not contacted my bank at all and still has my money. They have no corporate number and do not respond to emails on their website. I have remain patient enough with these unprofessional jewelers. If you guys come in here pay cash and save yourself the headache. I returned with my little sister and I was able to purchase her a beautiful necklace and a cross for a great price.  Overall, play on the safe side if you got the cash.< /text>< rating>

<Review>This is the first time i have experienced buying a piece of jewelry in a store that took almost 30 MINUTES TO PROCESS my purchase.
They make me feel like i was buying a 40k BRAND NEW CAR.
I already  had credit established with Kevin jewelry so i thought it was going to be a quick 3 to 5 minutes purchase
but they made me waist a lot of time for a piece of jewelry worth 100.00
i pull the cash to pay for the item but the employees insisted
to use my credit to take advantage of a 6 month free interest.
But i never expected from them to take that long.
I doubt i will ever buy anything from them ever again<//Review><gmap_id>0x80d951e2e2e881f9:0x8eba472b8ba00aa3</gmap_id>< Date>

Andreas was great he helped us set up our repairs and then worked with me on pricing when I came to pick up the repairs so I could get a surprise gift for my wife as well !

The repair process was a little longer , but that was my fault - I kept changing my mind - my rings loked great at the end and the new stone was brilliant !<//text>

Sized me incorrectly for my wedding ring. Then lied to me about when it would show up. Then told me I had to pay $50 to get a ring that fits. I really regret giving these people my business.</Text>

I had a very bad experience with KEVIN JEWELERS
I had a lay away and the customer service
Personnel return my lay away sent it to another store to be sold
And I was told I could not have my money
Return to me
So I was forced to purchase something else
Of not my choice
Bad experience all together
I will not return to that store
Also the customer service personnel
Are rude and non caring
Sorry for this review
But that was my experience with
KEVIN JEWELERS.< /Review>

DO NOT RENT FROM THIS PLACE!!!
I had called to reserve a sports car, a corvette to be specific for my Dad’s birthday. I reserved it two weeks in advance. I asked multiple times to be sure if it was possible to guarantee the specific car I wanted, they assured me yes but that they can’t guarantee the color or year of the car but that it would for sure be a corvette.
So I went ahead and booked it.
The morning of when I’m supposed to pick up the car, they call me an hour earlier to ask me if I’d like a Tesla instead... I said, “no thanks, I reserved a corvette, is there a problem?”

Basically long story short.. They 100% MISLED me into thinking I would for sure have what I wanted ready for me and that did not happen. Actually they told me twice I was for sure getting it but that it would be a couple hours later.
I said okay but I never heard back.
The day is now almost over and still no car. I finally just called to cancel the whole thing.
It really sucks because it was a surprise birthday gift for my Dad and he didn’t get to have his gift.
THEY ARE NOT DEPENDABLE AND THEY ARE LIARS!!!!!!! BEWARE AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!</review>

<text>Warning these people are sharks. Had my car repaired by Lens auto body. Insurance covered my rental but they got me for over $600 in fees. Knowing that my insurance covered my rental car for collision. Even my insurance company told me they are sharks and that’s how they make money. Just be carful. They are sharks. Won’t ever do business with them again and will spread the word about this. Sharks Enterprise!!!<//text>< Date>

<text>I am writing this review as a result of my wonderful experience and interaction with Travis T. His professional, courteous, and knowledgeable demeanor made it really easy to get the right rental car for my job. I told him I needed a car with good acceleration to adjust to the Los Angeles traffic. He was very informative and made many spectacular recommendations. He is a phenomenal employee and should get a raise. You hear me HR? His hard work and dedication should be recognized and equally compensated.</text>< gmapID>

KUDOS! To enterprise car rental at Jones Rd. Oceanside. My overall experienced to service and staff is excellent. Brittany and another male staff (who help me check in) are awesome. He asked me a few questions, and I end up telling him more. I'm comfortable enough to talk to him like a friend. I'm so busy running my mouth that I just simply forgot to get the name of that staff. Thanks to Enterprise for accommodating me on my last minute car rental. I always go for Enterprise since I never have problem with them.  Enterprise at Jones Road Oceanside is a must for me, for it's location and quality service.</text>

<Text>***Do note that there's an additional $200 deposit fee tacked on top of the costs.*** This was not mentioned anywhere during the reservation process online. Of course you are refunded the money when you return the car, but for those who use your debit cards, be sure you can cover that without over-drafting.

As for as this location:
Rented a car for a road trip. The employees greeted me when I walked in, went over the paperwork and associated fees before we examined the car for scratches/damages and I was on my way.</Text>< resp>

<Text>I got a rental on the spot as soon as I turned in my personal vehicle to the body shop, a van was all they had and I needed a vehicle so I got it, I payed the total for one day and did not pay for insurance because my personal insurance covers me, everything was fine till next day I got a smaller vehicle that fit my needs but, I they got me good because some how the guys put me for insurance for the vehicle without asking me, well I ended up paying almost double the amount I booked it for just because of the insurance and hidden fees. The staff was professional and friendly and good people but they got me this time with the insurance, I blame it on myself for not verifying upfront what I was going to pay for.</Text>< Resp>

I’ve been renting cars for travel for years and Enterprise is by far the best one out there. The reason I believe is because THEY PROVIDE THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! It’s the one thing that stands out the most to me over all the rest. The particular location that I go to is in Oceanside, CA on Jones Road. And it’s not just one employee that’s outstanding, it’s all of them. And it’s not just sometimes, it’s all of the times! Great crew and management!< /Text>

The staff are really nice but this location busy! I waited almost an hour for my rental. It was a pleasant waiting area and the return was much faster. Giving them the benefit of the doubt on the wait because they gave me a free upgrade and were very nice.< /review>

<Review>I rented a car from this location after my wife and children were in an accident during the Lilac fires. Matt and Chris were very helpful. The service was friendly and quick. I was there for about 10 minutes and they got us into a nice SUV even after the insurance was only willing to pay for a compact vehicle. Thank you Matt/Chris for the genuine service and for accommodating our needs during a stressful time.</Review>< Pictures>

I've been a Enterprise member for several years now. My first visit to the Enterprise Office on Jones Rd. was back in March. A initially rented a small SUV but got an upgrade to a nicer mid- size SUV which made my 1 month road trip extra comfortable. Though my SUV has expired plates & I had to get an oil change during my trip. Tammy was very apologetic and made it worth my time & effort. I eventually extended my rental for 3 months. Each and every time I had a question Tammy and or Matt we're very quick to respond and very helpful. I have since gone back to this office to rent vehicle's for long cross country road trips. The vehicles I have rented are clean, with no issues, & I even lucked out w/ one that had the XM Sirius hooked up. I have found the rest of the staff to be very friendly and personable. I often tell my friends if they ever need to rent a vehicle to go to the Enterprise Rental Office on Jones Rd., because these folks are great and try their hardest to take care of their customers.<//text>

Had a reservation on base which first opened 25min late and secondly, didn’t have cars on their lot. Luckily, this location was able to help us out in no time. This will be my go to from now on. The staff is friendly and professional. Thank you so much!< /Text>

Great staff, smart manager and quick service.  This was the first time a car rental company made me feel like I was really a guest and customer, not just sale.  I had my vehicle under repair due to an accident and these ladies really made my situation easier by taking care of paperwork/phone calls for me.  It's good to know I can still find good customer service these days when so many other businesses focus on the bottom line and lose sight of the customer.<//Text>

<Text>The service I experienced -GREAT!!!  I called the office and spoke with Lindsy informing them of the free double upgrade,  I came in Ivory helped me - giving me the free upgrade no fuss.  Returned the car following day and they drove me home - to my door step.  What a great team you have - friendly, efficient, caring and professional.  I would recommend this enterprise office to all of my friends and associates!<//Text><Time>1453821617566<//Time></record></dataset><record>

<review>I am a pest, a frequent renter when the specials are active and I take advantage of my points.  It takes patience to interact with me and they have it.  They are all fun as well as getting the job done quickly.  They have actually made my life easier.  They come get me when I want and bring me back when I want. My own family doesn't even do that.  Handle busy times and still make you feel comfortable.  I  leave things in the cars or office but have always gotten the back.  They really work as a team, including the person that washes the cars.   Thanks you guys..<//review>< pics>

< review>
I made a reservation at another location. 2 days later they call and tell me they can't accommodate my rental. I asked could they check other locations for a van, they said no sorry.

So I made calls and found one here. I made the reservation to pick up Saturday at 9am so I can get going. I arrived and didn't get my vehicle until after 10:35am. They said they cleaned the van and it was dirty and seemed like they attempted to wash but not rinse it. It was all dirty outside.  I asked for my printout and they said computer was down. Not a great experience on this rental. This ruined our plans to shop prior to taking friends to the LAX airport because of the delay.< /review>

The car was as promised and not a hassle to get or return! I had A family emergency and had to extend my trip a few days which was no problem! My only complaint is that they never answer the phone I sat on hold two separate times and at the 15 min. Mark it hung up on me so In order to extend the car I had to call an enterprise that was in the town I was staying in and not the town i rented It from.< /Review>

Sometimes we forget to write reviews when we get outstanding service. Such is the case here. I've dealt with this office several times, day rentals, week rentals and monthly rentals and everytime ... this staff provides exceptional service. And twice now, I've had to switch cars while out of state, once due to a brake concern and the other because my wife was uncomfortable in her seat (bad back) in both cases, it was a Saturday and when I called the Jones Rd. office, they took immediate action to help me locate an office where we could change vehicles. They made sure the new vehicle was acceptable and even called me hours later to check up. And upon return, they were wonderful and to my pleasant surprise there were not extra charges. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS OFFICE & COMMEND THEY'RE STAFF</text>

Another issue was having inventory to meet demand and yet another was license tags were due to expire (Florida plates) renting in California. Who do you think the CHP would have given the ticket to for expired tags? Do you think renters notice tag expiration? These concerns speak volumes about my experience past the initial phase of rental car check out. My suggestion is to pay attention to vehicle prep and have inventory to meet demand, don't let your customer pay for your operational issues through excessive wait times or self monitoring of vehicle issues...not my job.<//Text>< resp>

Had to rent a compact car at the last minute and called the location to see if one was available.  Was given a quote for $299 per week but when I arrived at the office, the contract had been revised to $229 per week.  This lower price was confirmed by the employee in person.  When I returned the car, the rental rate had been changed back to $299.  After haggling with the manager, she "met me half way" and took $35 off the total price.  Now looking on line at the weekly rental prices offered, I feel rather ripped off.  The same car (Nissan Versa) is available on line for $108 per week.  Nice car, pleasant employees and very convenient pick up/drop off but dicey on pricing.  Learn from my lesson, shop on line and do your research before agreeing to a price.  If I go back, I will certainly see what the on line rates are first.<//text>

This was a first for us to rent a vehicle that was not on an airport site.  I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth and easy the check in/out was.  The staff was very curteous and helpful.  I plan on going through the same site next time.

Worst experience I’ve ever had with a rental car facility and it’s employees, after renting here 15+ times over the course of the last three years with this location they were unwilling to accept payment with a debit card as they have in the past, offered proof of residency, offered to pay an additional deposit, no dice. Zack, Becca, LT have all been outstanding to work with in the past, this new manager was laughable. Such a bummer and a waste of an Uber there and back because I don’t choose to use credit. Was overcrowded and understaffed at 10:45 in the morning.< /text>

The service was great as always!! But we did complain about the vehicle (ford focus) my wife actually wanted to take it back but since we only had one day we dealt with it. The transmission on this car was horrible. The associate actually told me that these cars have horrible transmissions. Maybe they should get rid of them.< /review>

I love Enterprise, their customer service is the best. And they pick me up on time each time I call. Just book online at their website and sign up for Enterprise Plus and get free rentals when you have enough points.< /text>

These guys SUCK!!  Had family in town, reserved online, called in and said to save my reservation for the next day.  Will come in around 5:30 for pickup, they said no problem.  Called in the next day on my way there and they said they were out of cars, totally disregarded my reservation like a bunch of Low lifes...DO NOT REnt cars from these guys.. I'm letting everyone I know in San Diego..  Have lived here over 25 years, this place is a JOKE...< /Text>

Went here yesterday morning to pick up my rental, it was busy but all i got to say is customer service is 110%. Everyone in this location is very friendly, you get a greeting right at the door even if each agent was with a different customer. I have nothing else to say but if CORPORATE is reading this. Let it be known that the whole staffing at this location including the carwash guy works hard, delivers a very professional enviroment. Definitely going back!!!!</text>

Love Enterprise, but our branch on Jones Rd. in Oceanside has noticeably declined in customer service.  We often rent from that branch. The turnover in staff may be the reason for the change.  Hoping to see things swing back in a positive direction --<//text>

This was the third Enterprise office I contacted in the area for a rental and the 3rd where their phone service totally sucked.  I made a reservation, asked if there were any promotions for the weekend and was told no.  But there was which they offered me at 6pm on Friday only because of the b.s. I had to go thru on the phone with my credit card company.  Why I wasn't offered it on the phone nobody knows of course.  The rental was for 3 days, but they charged my card for 4.  When I questioned this a couple of days after returning it, I was told, "there was a computer glitch".  Funny, computers were invented 50 years ago and there haven't been "glitches" in them for a couple of decades now.  I was assured that the 4th day would be refunded, but it never was.  When I called to find out why, I was given a clear run around and lied to.  I was then asked to come into the office to get a cash refund because they couldn't get the refund to go thru on the machine.  Too much bs and lying at this office.  I don't recommend them even though their on-site customer service was good.<//Text>

< review>
I have rented a car from enterprise continuously for 5 years straight on their monthly
contract.
I have been a committed and loyal customer to enterprise.
I could not beleive the level of unprofessionalism by their manager Rachel Byrnes and associate Derrik.
My monthly contract was due for rewriting on a Sunday when they are closed, so and I had contacted Derrick to find out when they wanted me to come in.
He told me he was busy and that he would return my call.
He never called back so I called that Saturday. He told me Everything was fine and to just call in with the mileage for the vehicle and there would be no need to come into the office. I informed him that I would be going out of state to attend a wedding and that I wanted to make sure the information he was giving me was accurate.
He ASSURED ME EVERYTHING WAS FINE!!!!!!!!
That Monday they BEGAN CHARGING MY CARD THE DAILY rate which came out to $1200 dollars for 2 weeks! (I normally pay 650 per month).

I went in and talked to the manager as soon as I got back in-town, and she said that the charges would not be reversed despite the fact that it was an error on their part for not communicating to me that I needed to come in to rewrite.
I ASKED TO BE CONTACTED BY THE GENERAL MANAGER RICHARD SU.
ONCE I SAID THAT SHE TOLD ME SHE DIDN'T WANT TO RENT TO ME ANYMORE AND SHE ASKED FOR THE KEYS TO THE CAR!!!!!
With out any notice what so ever
This is at 9 am in the morning, I am on my way to work and to take my 2YEAR OLD DAUGHTER to preschool.
Now we don't have a car!!!! I AM STRANDED AT THE ENTERPRISE LOCATION WITH A 2 YEAR OLD!!!!
After being a customer for five plus years I was appalled at the way I was treated and the even more so at the situation they would put a mother with a child of that age in!!!! And horrible situation for my daughter and I.
It was a very unethical decision by the manager.  I would NOT RECCOMEND THIS LOCATION TO ANYONE!!!!!!
We had to take a taxi to leave!!!!  We went to Avis. Hopefully we will have better experience there.</review>

The Manger here is very friendly and works with the customers to give them the best value for their money.  Plus the first month is free.  I rented a 5X10 inside a storage locker.  It was enough to store my personal belongings, but I really had to maximize my available space.  The people are friendly here and you don't have the campers here.  The ones that never go home.  The site is extremely clean and the units are very nice with secure doors.  The lighting in the halls is bright, but inside the smaller units, there are no lights.  The hours are from 6 am to 10 pm.  Ample time to do what you need and you can choose your own time.  The price is average at $132 for my small space.  No bathrooms now because of the construction going on.  Next month they will be finished, and ready for use, that's if the COVID19 CLEARS.  They have an on-site Manager, adds to the level of safety.  Overall I recommend this storage facility, just on the Manager here on site.  She's polite, friendly, and not a snoop. Thank goodness.</text>

Typically I dont do reviews, but Amanda deserves a excellent review. First time at this location(storage). Amanda is the the person to talk to. She walked me through the process( always happy to help me out and very happy to answer all my questions). since now I need an app in order to have access to the units. Very glad to come to this location.< /Text>

<gmap_id>0x80dc71b93972ea27:0x8fdf618f7e5d5f6<//gmap_id><Review>5 star review for both Amanda and Sabina for their professionalism and phenomenal customer service. RV and trailer parking lot has been repaved along with a lot of other renovations and repairs. Book your reservation for storage online - it's definitely cheaper than just walking in. Unfortunately, we had our trailer broken into and items were stolen. The manager Amanda viewed hours of surveillance from her 24 hour cameras and located the theft on video. While there wasn't too much more that she or anyone else could really do at that point, she remained in touch with us offering both her care and support. What more can you ask for? Thanks again, Amanda and Sabina.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1619570958127, 'text': 'Hi Dahlia. Thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback!

Amanda is the manager here and is excellent at her job. She cares about the customers and keeps a clean and orderly facility. If there is a concern that you bring to her she takes care of it timely and efficiently. I recommend this place for all storage and rv rental space.<//Review>

Ms. Amanda Lopez. Is such welcome experience in today’s society and business practices. I have found her to be extremely professional at every time I have encountered her. She is very informative and patient, no matter how busy she seems at times. Out of all the people I have had business relationships with, Ms. Amanda Lopez is a standard that should be established as a benchmark for Extra Space Storage..

<rate>5</rate><review>I have to say I am impressed with the professionalism and knowledge Amanda has showed us! We have been looking at different storage places around town and found some decent ones, but this one seems legit. Not only did she know her stuff and was very informative and direct with the rules and procedures for the renters, she also reassured safety. As we toured the place, I noticed the gate always locked unless you have a code or buzzed in, her office is right by the entrance, so she has eyes around, and driving around there weren’t people like hanging out loitering which was my main concern. She doesn’t allow people loitering all day there. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone as long as she is running the place! She must care about her work because it definitely shows and stands apart against the other storage areas that’s for sure!< /review>< pictures>

Quick and easy storage solution in Oceanside.  The staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  I've had mold problems in the past at other storage facilities here in Oceanside, but this storage unit I just got was bone dry, not a hint of mold smell, + I didn't see any signs of insects or rodents, which was a major selling point for me.  Highly recommended.< /Text>

<Text>The store manager Amanda was extremely helpful, knowledgeable and respectful to our needs. Phenomenal customer service. She was very friendly throughout the entire process. She knew how valuable our time was and worked efficiently during the storage rental process. I would highly recommend her for your storage rental needs! They also significantly beat out the pricing of other storage facilities. 1st month free!! We were very please with this experience.

P.S. she followed all safety guidelines for COVID. I was very impressed with this process because safety is a priority.

The team, throughout the process has been fantastic!  Rodney went through extra hoops early Saturday 31 of August to expedite my registration and access process and really worked magic to mediate a difficult situation (as with all moves:))  I thank you and really glad I selected Extra Space again.

Never had any problems and my stuff was always safe. Not much else I can day about a storage space since all that really matters is got secure it is and how the staff is the 1 or 2 times you see them which is doing signing up or closing out. Prices are very good too!< /Review>

<text>My wife and I visited this location to rent a space at off site location.  Needed a storage unit for my daughter moving out of her apt at Cal State Fullerton.  James and David were most helpful in getting the best unit available.  Even calling that location to make sure we got the first unit inside the access door on the first floor to make life easier for us. You can't go wrong dealing with these two guys and this company. Recommend highly.<//text>< user_name>

< Review>
I originally rated this storage unit as a 5. We had a good experience getting the unit but the first week we got it, they were having gate issues. The manager told us about it right away and said they would be getting it fixed soon. A few days later we went to take over a load and the gate was closed so we assumed they got it fixed. We put in our code to get in and it worked! Which would have been great if it ended there. When we tried to get out the code box to get out wasn’t working. It had a sign that said go around to the back gate and use that one. So we did. Well it didn’t work either. So we were literally trapped in the complex with no way to get out (the office was already closed). I finally was able to get ahold of someone from extra space storage and they told me to go back to the back gate and use there code they gave us. So we tried, and it didn’t work. They said they would call the property manager and let her know what’s going on. We waited for 30 mins before someone called us, just to inform us that it should be working so they don’t know why it’s not. We were so angry at this point.  Luckily someone else drove up, which is the only reason we got out!! And we still haven’t heard a word from anyone from extra space storage about the situation. Not an apology, not a call to see if we got out, nothing. We will not be using them again after this time.</Review>

I had reserved a unit online back in June and 5 minutes after I received a call from the facility to confirm. Upon moving in, I had the opportunity to interact with James who was very polite and professional, and answered all my questions and concerns.
When I moved out, I was taken care of by the manager David, he was also very Courteous, professional.
I'll definitely consider using this location again for my storage needs in the future.</review>

<review>David was amazing and very helpful,  pulled up to the office and he helped me change my reservation to a larger unit on the spot, walked over to the unit and showed me everything.  Helped me utilize the best deal for the time I'd be there.

Highly recommended!<//review>< Pictures>

<text>Not happy with the high cost and the constant raise in rent. I feel it is they raise their rent constantly and it is not a gradual raise each time. When I question the price about another raise in rent, I am told it is because I have a popular unit which is in high demand. I have always had a storage since I moved to Oceanside in 1988 and price I pay now is about a 250% price hike for the same size storage which continues to rise at a high rate. Not happy with the rent and the constant increase!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1566262977528, 'text': "Hi, Donna.

< Review>
Love it.  Super convenient especially that all units are on floor level. No lease or shady hidden rules or fees within contract & very affordable.  Great staff and no big deal if your a day or 2 late on rent no late fee.  Great security and customer service.  I recommend this to anyone especially if your like me and struggling financially.</Review>

<text>This is a great storage unit business. I was able to use their free truck to move into our 10x15' unit which saved a lot of time and effort. The manager David was very helpful and knowledgable. Overall, our experience has been very good. I would recommend this company.</text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Only been there for a few months, someone broke into my unit and stole some of my possessions. At first the guy at the desk said they would review the tape and do everything they could to help find who had broken into my storage. After I started asking about more details on how they would help he changed his tune and basically told me that there was too much tape to review(note that thought they have many cameras around they have only about 4 video feeds for the entire facility, tells you how much they care about protecting your belongings) and that he was too busy and that he was going to do absolutely nothing to assist in this matter. I understand that break ins will happen, but the fact that this company is not willing to help when it does happen is ridiculous. My payment is not just for storage, it is for protection. I did everything I was required to protect my belongs, it is your responsibility to protect it when I am not there. And it is also your responsibility to help in any way you can, line simply taking some tome to review security tape, to track down who was involved in the theft. Even if the insurance attempts to cover what they can, there are some things that can’t be replaced. I would not and will not recommend anyone ever store here.

I moved to another storage across the street across where I save over 25% and it’s a new facility with many cameras that are actually recording what is goin on on their premises<//Review>

<review>Assistant manager Richard (butterfingers) and Dave were very helpful in getting me squared away with my unit, even entertained my girls while in the office. I highly recommend this storage location. Way better than A-1 storage across the street. Richard (butterfingers) even brought my family and I waters while we were unloading our u-haul into our unit.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< time>

<username>Allison K</username><time>1534067283123< /time><rate>1</rate><Review>Do NOT store your personal belongings with Extra Space Storage.  Search complaints and reviews online for this company and bring your business else ware.

Due to the recession, I have been storing my furnishings and most of my personal belongings, including many family heirlooms, for over seven years at a cost of over $9000, with Extra Space Storage.  My belongings were stored neatly in closed boxes and I made my payments on time each month.  I had the option to store my belongings in a three car garage just one mile away from this Extra Space Storage facility, but I chose to go with a professional storage facility in order to keep my belongings clean and safe.

This turned out to be one of the worst decisions I have ever made.  I went to retrieve my belongings two weeks ago and due to a large leak in the wall of this facility, ALL of my items were either damaged and covered with black, green and yellow mold or they smelled like mold.  The mold was so severe that the company instructed two of its’ employees to stop helping me rebox five of the 125 boxes I had stored there.  These boxes were the most damaged and they told these employees that it was too dangerous for their health.  But apparently, their customers’ health is irrelevant since they never bothered to return my calls after this decision was made.

It was clear by the extent of the damage to my belongings that this wall in their facility had been leaking for many months to years, but nobody from Extra Space Storage ever notified me.  They just kept taking my payments each month while frequently raising the rates as well.  In my opinion, this is gross negligence due to Extra Space Storage not properly maintaining their property.  The fact that I did not carry personal property insurance should be immaterial.

I have now spent over two weeks obtaining furniture repair estimates and unpacking all of my belongings, discarding what has been destroyed by mold and cleaning what is salvageable.  I then have to repack all of my belongings again for an upcoming move in the near future.  I expect this enormous task to take another few weeks before being completed.  Time-consuming and costly is an understatement.

Finally, the most unbelievable part of this entire situation is that a manager from Extra Space Storage actually threatened me via email by stating that if I shared my experience with Extra Space Storage publicly via reviews, social media, filing complaints, etc., Extra Space Storage would take legal action against me.  I found this to be a bullying tactic and more importantly a freedom of speech issue.<//Review>< pictures>

Great service, I love this place, I have been using this storage service for the last 2 years never had an issue or problem that the management couldn't solve. Definitely recommend specially if you are deploying and need to store just stuff.< /text>

When I went to pay my bill they told me I owed $189.00 +insurance=$202.00 and that is what I signed for. My sister was with me and heard them say "$118.00 for six months.
I would not give them any stars, but could not post until I hit one. Bad Business company!</Review>< gmapID>
