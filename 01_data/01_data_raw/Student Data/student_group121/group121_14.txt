< Review>
Plain and simple Dayna is the best and will always take care of you! I’ve been ordering flowers from her since she opened up shop. Not once has she disappointed with the arrangements I’ve ordered for my mother. Did I mention I live in Texas and she always makes sure that the whole transaction is as smooth as possible. Thank you Dayna!< /Review>

This place is NOT good with customer service. Ordered my3 year old sons funeral arrangements here (not cheaply either) and they were delivered to the services, we arrived literally less than 10 minutes after they were delivered and they looked dead and ugly, and the blue flowers in some arrangements were completely different than other ones, so it didnt match. We contacted them about it, they said its the funeral chapels fault "because they used too much bleach in the building", and they offered to give us $25 of our $460 order back, what a joke. Even the workers at the chapel said the flowers looked dead and ugly when we got there. Unfortunatly I didnt take pictures of the dead white roses before I fixed them. Don't waste your money here, wish I didn't.</text>

{'time': 1493765390693, 'text': 'Mr. Angus, I tried to reach out to you and you did not get back to me. As I had mentioned in the message to you, we send our sincerest apologies for the confusion on the light and dark blue delphinium. While you were here ordering, we showed you pictures and you had stated you wanted the arrangement in question just like the picture, which included light blue delphinium. I also sent you pictures of the arrangement before it left here. The flowers were in beautiful condition. I also posted those pictures on here. We were concerned with the strong fumes of bleach at the funeral home as that will kill flowers quickly. I offered you a refund on the Delphinium as they were not the color you had expected in only one arrangement. I did not realize you were wanting a refund for all the flowers that we delivered. As you stated in your text message the other arrangements were just fine. The pictures you provided me where zoomed in on only two separate stems of flowers. I could not see the rest of the arrangement and the flowers around those that you took looked perfectly fine. I offered you the cost of the Delphinium that was different than what you had expected. I am sorry you had to take this Avenue to try to resolve this as stated before I did try to reach out to you and you did not get back to me.'}< /response>

{'time': 1608692646426, 'text': 'Dear Miss Sims, first let me start by sending my condolences on the loss of your friend\'s husband. This is a very terrible time as everyone has been impacted by this horrible virus, to include all of us here.\n\nDebbie tried explained to you, the service charge was implemented by the wire service.  We cannot waive that charge when a customer is ordering on line from our website.  As Debbie explained to you, if we took the order over the phone, the  service charge would not be implemented. As far as Debbie handling her self, when she explained that all orders online have service fees and everyone is charged, you disrespectfully told her "I DON\'T CARE ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE,  ALL I CARE ABOUT IS ME" you also went on to say that I,  the owner, should be paying all the service charges in this time of covid. Miss Sims, I  am a very small business owner who is also feeling the effects of this covid crisis. You had told Debbie that you never in your life you ever had to pay a service charge,  which I find completely hard to believe, especially if you ever ordered concert tickets or paid for gas with a credit card. If the service charge was a minimal issue, then there would not be an issue.  Miss Sims, you blew up and insisted we not charge you and even after Debbie tried to explain to you that we were not able to waive the fees from the Internet you still insisted.  As Debbie also tried to explain to you that any online floral website there are service fees.\n\nMiss Sims, we are ALL feeling the stress of the world situation these days. Yelling and screaming over $5.99 service fee and insisting we waive it and you not be charged is just not acceptable.  Miss Sims, Debbie did offer to take your order over the phone the four different times you called with questions.\n\nWe do give wonderful customer service,  we do many extra things for our customers and for our community.  But when we have individuals who raise their voice and become rude and disrespectful,  at that time, the conversation is over. No one deserves to be spoken to the way you spoke to Debbie today.\n\nSorry this had to end this way, but respect does go both ways.\n\nAddendum:\n\nMiss Sims,  I heard the entire conversation, the tone of voice from both parties involved.  She did not have to give me information as I heard it first hand.'}</response>
<userid>103719927836792049239<//userid><user_name>Lori</user_name><Text>TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!  I contacted this florist this afternoon for an explanation regarding some unexpected charges while ordering some flowers on-line.  I spoke to Debbie and explained that although I've been charged for using my credit card at different retailers, I had never been surcharged for using my credit card (American Express) outside of local taxes and delivery charges over the phone when buying flowers locally.  Now the surcharge was not the problem, it was there mere fact of how she handled herself!  I informed her that she would rather lose lose 91.00, instead of attempting to resolve my concern and making a concession to possibly subtract 5.99 from the original charge for the initial arrangement.  Debbie told me that if she did it for me it would have to do it for everybody else.  She even went as far as to challenge me about my level of compassion, this is when I went from 0 to 10 because the person I was was ordering the flowers for had just lost her husband to Covid-19 and she was recently diagnosed with Covid 19!   Debbie literally wanted to argue me down about a 5.99 charge instead of conferring with the manager/owner to resolve this menial issue.  I assure you this review is not being written because of the 5.99 charge, simply stated it's about customer service.

Addendum: 9:36pm
Dear owner, I'm not going to waste my time or energy with an extensive response.  However, I will tell you that the next time you decide to respond to a complaint,  you may want to contact the customer FIRST to discuss the matter before you post inaccurate information based on what you your employee informed you.  You won't have to worry about another response or review from me because I will not think twice about ever contacting you again for assistance!</Text><pics>None< /pics><Rate>1<//Rate></record>

I'm currently overseas for the last couple of months, Ive been wanting to get my wife flowers but the last couple of times I have been let down by other on-line flower companies, I noticed that Fairy Tales Flowers is near my families location so I put the order in using their Website, which is very easy to navigate through, at 2am in the morning for same day delivery since it was offered. No later than 2pm that same day my wife was surprised with this awesome arrangement of flowers. Fairy Tale Flowers really did an awesome job and look forward to continuing business. Thanks for working hard and making it happen Fairy Tales Flowers. P.S. Please don't mind the little beverage's, my sister in law placed them as icing on the cake.</review>

I simply cannot recommend this florist highly enough!! Dayna did such an amazing job putting together the flower arrangements for my daughter's baby shower. My request was a bit "out-of-the-box" but Dayna completely exceeded my wildest dreams and expectations!! Her beautiful work added the perfect finishing touches and made a beautiful event even more beautiful and perfect. The 25+ guests were blown away by her creativity and talent! Dayna will never know how grateful I am for her outstanding work and customer service. And for those of you who are working within a budget, you'll not find a florist offering more reasonable prices. Outstanding quality at affordable prices. PLEASE, let Dayna handle all of your flower needs. She will not disappoint!! Thanks, Dayna. You are incredible! You will always be my special "Flower Fairy!!!"</Review>

<Text>There are brand new owners for this business. They just took over. WOW... What a difference from the previous owners. The shop is clean and bright. Talk about a complete change. I could not believe the improvements the new owners have made. There is such a large selection of flowers and arrangements. There is also many beautiful plants. The new owners are very welcoming. I had ordered flowers for a funeral that needed to be at the service before 9:00 am. Dayna, the owner said she would take it there herself first thing in the morning. The shop opens at 9:30, but Dayna came in and had the flowers to the chapel by 8:00am. I so appreciate her taking such good care of us. I had seen previous comments about the people being rude. Please know that these are brand new owners and the rude employees are no longer there. I highly recommend Fairy Tales Flowers</Text><Name>karlata33< /Name><GmapID>0x80c366d6722d6d67:0x6a533b556bfb33f2</GmapID><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Review>I ordered a floral arrangement for my mom . I paid $70 and they delivered a cheap looking arrangement that had only 4 roses and what looked like weeds, it was ugly. And at the time of ordering the owners brother was there telling racist jokes to another person there. II will never go there again and would recommend if you want flowers go to the supermarket, you'll get more better flowers.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

We do back up our product, but you didn't even give us a chance and decided to post here. Also, just like any living thing, if you leave flowers in a hot car, they will die and that is beyond our control. Anytime there is an issue, we need to know, not by finding out here, but at least give us a call to let us know,  I do see by your past reviews, it seems you are not happy with many business up here. In the future, take into consideration that if you are not happy with service or products, let the business know and give them a chance to make it right.  There is also a responsibility for the consumer to take care of the product to prolong the life and quality of the product."}</response></record></dataset><record>

This review is mainly for the mango sweet rice which I had previously had here and loved. It was my birthday and I decided on some mango sweet rice (to go) instead of cake. The mango was fine, but the rice was a brownish color and had some really hard bits to it that made me feel like I was going to break a tooth. The rice I had other times was white and not hard. I am unsure if the recipe was recently changed, but I will no longer be buying mango sweet rice from here.<//review>

Scrumptious pad thai, always !

Lunch specials are affordable

Morefire offers lunch specials every day of the week including weekends. Our group of four enjoyed a variety of Thai dishes served with either brown or white rice. The satay chicken appetizers with peanut or cucumber sauce were especially good. We felt really well taken care of by our servers.< /text>

<review>The combination appetizer was really great and quality was impressive. (definitely better than other thai places in the area) I got my kids the combination rice and even had to take a few bites because it looked yummy.  The pad thai was a little greasy for me, but I'm going to give it another try or try a different entree. I would definitely rate 4 5 just the grease was a little set back.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<review>This is the worst place where you can go they say they were close at 9:30 and it's not true I came today from very far away to eat here 10 minutes before 9 p.m. and they say the kitchen was closed , but if I want to take the food with me they can cook I asked them are you guys closed or open a lady said that the kitchen was closed but if I take the food with me is open I asked this question AGAIN,  and I still don't get it this people are very bad they do not know about a  business and customer service I felt discriminated. I will never come to this piece of up no good place again in my life  if you can understand me this was my honest opinión Thank you so much for taking time to read this ,one more thing the food is not that great and the portion that they give you are not wath they show in there menu , be aware this place is a joke.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWxldKWhXshDJHBxVT6lt0O3rDGSVoggjQjB5r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnI1G-KuLmvR5q-CmLk1rLcNf6r6YjRQxvkLtr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNo4kTLiGbzf8rwSD6ln5ZX-6Ns3jSBCtG6Wsgg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

The staff was nice and helpful to take care of my special need. Not only that, I found that the food was true to the Thai Cuisine - not the fusion stuff that dilutes the essence of the taste of Thai food. I will go back there again and again.</Review>

Always tasty, always fresh, and able to accommodate large parties easily. We love coming in and trying something new because we have yet to receive something we didn't like. For how delicious they are they're rarely busy and a perfect spot when you need a quick and flavorful bite.</text>

My favorite place to go for Kung pow chicken and thai fried rice. Love the quality and freshness of the veggies. I especially love that there is a variety of veggies in there kung pow dish. The rich flavors and different textures are so amazing and delicious that I can even eat the mushrooms, which I normally dislike very much. I tried their thai iced coffee for the first time today....O!M!G! It was very tasty and refreshing. My favorite Thai restaurant, wish I could give it a 10 star!</Text>

Meaning I'll eat for 8.00 Exactly, then I leave a cash tip. But most meals I see are $8.00, $9.00, etc. None of that 7.95 plus tax nonsense that leaves you shuffling for coins. Also makes it easy to split the bill of going for lunch with Co workers haha<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Ate here last night with 7 relatives. The good news, service was excellent as in 5 stars! The not so good news, Tom Yum soup was too sweet and the shrimp too salty! It lacked the flavor of authentic Thai cooking. The fried rice was good but too oily! The Pad Thai was ok. The Green Curry was so so and the beef that came with it was kinda tough and dry. We also ordered some fried stuff and some salads but lacked the oomph!
First, we were going to eat at Asahi Japanese Buffet which is some few feet away but the line was long. I know the Morefire Cooks can do a better job.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Food is tasty and probably too cheap for the portions they give out at lunch. There were, surprisingly, many lunch combo options.  I think they could charge more and do some updates inside, and clean carpets; it would help making the place look and smell cleaner.< /Review>< pictures>

Wait 40 minutes for food. Place looks trashed. Seats are ripped.  Don't come here. Food is not good. Don't understand why people rated 4 starts or higher. I guest they don't know what good food is.</Text>

<Text>Absolutely unbelievable—the best Thai in Riverside and quite possibly in the entire IE. Their food is consistently served HOT, unlike some restaurants where the food isn't quite hot coming out. The fried rice has such an insanely delectable blend of flavors and yet isn't too oily; that balance is hard to achieve! The noodles are great, the coconut milk has a true kick. Highly original dessert (banana fried in wonton skins). Definitely returning regularly!</Text>< Pics>

Typical family run Thai business.  I have been several times. Usually only.two people serving food and they are always running between tables. The service is mediocore.at best but I have always liked the food..the wait is not that long. The place is old and decore is minimal, very spacious and wide..seeems to be visited by locals mostly..great place.for family not dinner not the option if going for something fancy. Typical clients are people at work or.who live in area. I have never been and it was crowded.<//text>

Our most favorite place for Thai...we have tried places in Los Angeles, Riverside, and Moreno Valley, and we considered Morefire superior...Their tomyum soup with shrimp is beyond excellent...their shrimp are huge and plentiful no matter what dish you order with shriimp...soooo fresh, never dry and tough to chew. Prices are great. Now they are even able to offer beer and wine. Try the hot pot shrimp, or the pad kee mow...excellent. Decor is not important when you have such fresh food. It is a clean, friendly restaurant. We often order just the soup as carryout because we love it sooo much.</Text>

< Review>
1st & last vist, ordered pinapple fried rice, 1 of my favorite thai dishes. This had to be the worst I've ever had, wasn't curried, and I actually asked for med spicy, but they don't curry it at all. Also they put tomatoes, never seen that before, tried it, definitely a no go, also. And none of the woman spoke english, I've never been to any thai place that doesn't speak english. It seems this was probably actually supposed to be a chinese restaurant but there trying to impersonate thai.< /Review>

This guy is rude.  Eliza's review is pretty accurate. Its sad to see that an owner of a business speaks like that to its customers. Definitely loss me. First, I want to state that I did not take the photo. Other reviewer did it. I was looking at the photos to show the audience who I was talking about. To All: please read the reviews.

Always rude people working this place. Very slow service. Never open on time.

For a real Philly, patty melts, & even hot pastramis, head to Canada Steak Burger in University.< /Text>

<Review>This is one of your cheaper cheesesteak options and it's really good! The best part is their fries are always hot and fresh. Sometimes you need to wait for them to cool. And the lady always working the register is very nice.< /Review><date>1599527013367</date>< pics>

<Review>LoL!!!!
This is my first time coming to this restaurant
I saw the few reviews  and all I can say is these karens
Need to stop!!!
I saw the guy struggling just trying to get orders out quickly
And these Karens would keep asking him for extra this and extra that. The guy was pretty nice about it the whole time but you could tell he was frustrated which is understandable.
Anyways, I had to wait extra 5minutes because this woman wanted to make a scene saying she wanted 10 ketchups
Since they didn’t give to her the first time she wanted refund.
LOL wow what a BRAt.
Anyways by the time I got my sandwich the owner apologized for waiting and he wanted to make it up by giving me free lemonade coupon. I told him “ Hey I saw the whole thing. You are doing a good job out there. I felt bad for you.” The guy just smiled and didn’t say anything and he also told me if my  food was cold , he ocould make a brand new.
The owner is pretty nice guy for my experience.
I will be definitely coming back.
Thank you guys for your great service.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<review>Delicious steak sandwiches, however, in NO WAY a Philly steak! Go here and try one of their creations and you won't be disappointed.
Most sandwiches come with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and whatever steak cheese, bacon, bbq, chicken combo you come up with. The sandwiches are pretty good size. I usually get a small (maybe two smalls).
Fries also come in all variety, but try the nacho fries, they are indulgent and ridiculous, and so yummy!< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>This place was very popular. We came here at night, and there were a lot of people waiting for their food. This was the evening before Thanksgiving. Our food probably took 20 plus minutes to be ready. I heard the lady say these fries are for #19, our number, but the person she handed them to, gave the fries to someone in front of us. So when our sandwich was ready, we had to wait for fresh French fries. The food was pretty good. Would definitely come here again, just hope the service is a little faster.<//Review>< time>

I was really impressed with the friendly staff and service! Danny and Jacob assisted me and also recommended that I try the worlds greatest Philly cheesesteak which was absolutely delicious! I can’t wait to come back to see what else they recommend! Thank you for your fast and friendly service!<//text>

While I was in line to order I watched the side of the table, that they had in the window fall on the head of little girl. The mother was actually behind me in line and we could not believe what had happened. How could this establishment be so parlous and unaware of the table? Why was that table even out there if it was not reliable and steady? Why was there not a sign up or just anything, to let their customers know not to lean on it. Complete negligence. The staff was considerate. They gave her a card for a free meal, the lady with the head wrap or hat thing seemed apologetic and grabbed the woman some ice, while another young lady gave the child a cookie. My main concern was management.. The store manager was not even there to solve the problem. He eventually showed up but I overheard them speaking. These people were more concerned with, if she was the reason why the side of the table collapsed on her.  I was confound by what I heard. There is no way that I will be returning to this establishment. Absolutely zero accountability taken for this situation.</review>

<text>It is ok food. I got the philly chicken and the chicken was dry and tasted frozen. I'll rather get the teriyaki chicken from couple of doors down. The cashier that helped me was very nice and attentive. It seemed like she was the only one working quick. The other workers looked bored and reminded me of the movie zootopia with the sloths. My mom ordered food from the Japanese teriyaki place and their line was longer and somehow she ended up getting her food first 🤷‍♀️</text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80d955496231ae77:0x9bdab31111e938cc</gmap_id></record>

<review>Sooooo bad! We waited over 30 mins for our order. and not just us, everyone else too! The workers don’t know how to read the orders and if you ask them what sandwich they made they don’t know. They blindly make things and call out random numbers! Terrible terrible service and workers. The sandwiches don’t even taste good for $11 ! they are greasy and make your stomach feel upset! don’t recommend at allllll!! Save your money and go to Stone Oven.< /review><resp>None<//resp><name>Andy Lee</name></record></dataset><record>

I am only leaving a comment because I see some of the comments  before an I want to mention my experience over the weekend. I got there when they were closing. They hurry us to close the door even when the people are inside. This guy that looks like he likes mans made my food with no gloves on. I was like wow I could not believes this. Maybe some kitchens do this but there as broom out so I dont know if this guys uses broom no washing hands and make my food. Is no good to eat for me.< /Text>

GO TO A DIFFERENT ATT STORE..... I wish I could put negative stars. The manager there Edward sold me my phones and plan. I got a new line and ported one over. Got a Samsung 21 and a iPhone 12 max pro. I was going to trade my iPhone XR across for the $700 credit. But was told If I have a phone that will value $35 it would give me the credit I had one for the 21 Samsung. That gave me 800 so that was fine but when I went in to trade in the phone I was told no iPhone is only $350 off l. He denied saying that of course. I know what he said I’m a pretty smart guy. I had my iPhone XR in my hand to trade in but he said I could sell it get a Samsung 7 and that would give me the $700 for the 12 pro max. So I lost 350$. If you talk to Edward make sure you get it in writing he seems to mis lead his customers.<//review>

We came in late and Albert was so accommodating. We had so many questions and he answered all of them because he was so knowledgeable. We needed a plan that was suitable for our current account. He activated each line and it was so tedious but well done. The store had to close soon but he stayed after to finish the job. We apprechiate the time and effort that he put in. Not because it was required,but simply the fact that he cared for us customers. We want to thank you and thank all the hard working associates that work here. Keep it up 😁<//review>

AT&T store personnel cut short his lunch hour to assist a customer. Not all places of business are as dedicated to their customers. He was able to resolve my issues in no time.</Text>

I saw an ad on television in the middle of the night it said AT&T had a deal on phone new service Oso service so I wanted to ask questions the gentleman was not very polite not very accommodating and when you say small talk it was very small I'll be going to another AT&T store so I can get clarity to find out more details about AT&T service I am an AT&T producer since the 1900's< /Review>

<Text>I live in Tijuana and crossed into the state's last night just to pay my bill. After checking the website and seeing that the store closes @ 9pm on Saturdays. I was furious whrn i got there shortly after 8pm to find out they were closed. This AT&T location is a joke the employees are lazy and apparently make up their own hours.<//Text><time>1575819262520</time>< Pics>

Unprofessional employees have no idea what they are doing. They did not even apologize for their mistake.  AT&T should train or better yet hire qualified people.< /Review>

The store advertises closing at 9:00pm and it's not true at all. I came in at 8:03pm letting the staff know they have open on their web page until 9 and they closed the door in front of me rather than providing best in class customer service. Highly dissatisfied!< /Text>

<Review>I have a family member who resides at Victoria Post Acute and they rant and rave about how much they love the nurses! The care that residents receive here is unbelievably amazing. All of the nurses and nursing assistants are so sweet and talkative. There’s so many opportunities for my family member to take some fresh air and even bird watch! Anytime I come to visit, the staff make me feel right at home.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

This place is awesome! I love all the staff here they’re all so sweet, especially they’re all super attentive and caring for the patients, you can tell they love them and they’re job! I came here once for a window visit and I was in awe of how bright the whole facility looked, they have nice patios and a whole bird aviary with the most gorgeous birds ever for the patients to look at. The cleanliness of this place is really good as well!!! 10/10!< /review>

<Date>1615601197631</Date><review>I recently had a member of my family spend time at this facility and cannot recommend it enough for anyone who needs short or long term care. The facility was extremely clean and had a great deal of policies and procedures in place in respect to the ongoing pandemic making patients and visitors feel safe and comfortable while going through a difficult time. Every staff member i had contact with went above and beyond for me and my family and we will be forever grateful. The staff definitely exceeds expectations for high quality patient care. They are hardworking and caring making sure they do everything possible to help each and every patient achieve their goals!< /review>< GmapID>

Victoria’s post acute facility is a place where I felt at home. It is very clean and the nursing assistants do an amazing job with the patient care. The residents are AMAZING!!! And so are the staff, they’re really helpful and kind with their words and wouldn’t pass up the opportunity to teach about their job.< /review>

This is the Best Facility in East County.
This facility was my son's great-grandmothers last place she called home. She was admitted under hospice care. From the first day of admission staff always went above and beyond to ensure all her needs were met. Not to mention how accommodating they all were anytime we visited.  Housekeeping and laundry staff did an amazing job ensuring her room and clothes were allways clean.
The food was delicious and always made from scratch.  I am beyond grateful for all the staff that helped care for grandma. Always making sure she was comfortable until the Lord called her home.  The nursing staff was great. Always giving us updates.
On her last day the staff ensured our family had some time with her so we could all say our goodbyes.  Thank you to all the staff at Victoria Post Acute.<//text>

My family has had a great experience with Victoria Post Acute. The staff has the biggest hearts. They are all extremely attentive. The staff has done a great job with the hard times we are all going through. They have such a positive attitude and uplifting spirit. It makes you feel, so comfortable to leave your loved ones, who care and love just as much as you do.</review>

I had visited this facility 5 times and had the opportunity to go around for observations within the area....first thing I noticed was its awesome cleanliness and don't have that "hospital smell " which I typically smell on different facilities I visited.   The lobby ambiance alone represents a healthy place where you want to be taken cared off.  The staff are very accommodating,  administrators and department heads,  especially nursing services, are beyond expectations knowledgeable...it is really a perfect place for post acute care , and when I need it, this is the place and will strongly recommend.<//Text>

I love this place!! So clean and staff is so friendly!!! I loved Dianne she was so awesome and knew what she was doing!! The staff goes above and beyond the expected patient care..they truly do care. They have a lot of activities and are safe with the COVID restrictions( so important) my favorite part was the birds in the back!! The cute outside area that you get to relax by...100x would recommend!!< /Text>

To start, the cleanliness of this facility surpasses most I’ve seen in San Diego/El Cajon. I’ve been at this facility for well over 2 weeks and I cannot say enough great things. Staff is wonderful as well as administration. They attend to each resident and make sure their needs are met. The quality of life at this facility is amazing and they make sure that each resident is treated with grace. They try to bring normalcy to their residents. The fact that the ratings are so low is shocking because I truly believe it should be higher. Consider this place and see for yourself!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

The staff pays close attention to the patient's health and tidiness to provide the best environment for everyone in their care. Whenever I go and visit my loved ones, they greeted me with open arms. What I love about the facility is that their staff speaks another language. I was beyond pleased knowing that they communicate the patient's native language shows the connection between the patient and staff.</review>< rating>

Victoria was willing to accept her and showered her with wonderful care. Since I was 3000 miles away from her, my only form of communication was the phone. A cheerful voice answered every time!  Many thanks to the wonderful staff that cared for my mom during her stay and went the extra mile when it was time to be transferred back to her retirement center.<//review>< Pics>

I could not have been gifted a more professional and caring facility for my almost 77-year-old mother.
Starting with Teresa and Blanca, two of my mothers Favorite CNA ‘s. The med nurse Chris, whom my mother has adopted as her son. Then to top it off with the office end of it with Robyn and Wendy. These two ladies are always hard at work, making sure she gets the proper care, behind the scenes, dealing with constant transport to her neurologist and cancer doctor appointments on time and of course always ahead of the game with the Covid testing.

Thank you to all the staff, C OMalley</Review>

<Review>I don't normally give online reviews, but it's in my character to say in person empowering and motivating comments to deserving individuals--because not only do I see but also feel good deeds they do for others.....  I've been going to Victoria Post Acute Care (VPAC) and had the opportunity to see the Nursing staff render extraordinary care to their patients/residents.  A top characteristic in this field is having the true passion to always provide great care to patients/residents and not everyone has it.  So, it's very commendable that so many Nursing staff at VPAC are constantly in action providing passionate care--ensuring great care, dignity, and respect are given to all patients/residents.  Additionally, the Housekeeping/Laundry/Kitchen staff have been proactively fulfilling requests to make sure VPAC patients/residents have clean rooms, fresh and clean linens, and alternative meals, or whatever the needs could be at a given time.

In sum, Victoria Post Acute Care is a facility with beautiful outdoor garden and birds viewing areas where patients/residents can sit, relax, feel the nurturing sunlight--and, most importantly, where patients/residents are passionately cared for.  The management likes to hear comments, so it's a quality that exist to assess  what else could be done to maintain and improve a wholesome care for their patients/residents at VPAC.

It is crucial and ethical to have first-hand experience and observation in detailing a sensible review.  I'm posting this comment with 5 stars as I was there to see and feel all that I wrote here...  Along with the numerous patients/residents who I've seen smiled after they've been well-attended with a comforting bedside care, I'd like to say more power and "thank you" to all VPAC staff  for having and sharing a caring heart--a true joy beyond 5 stars I'm just glad to witness amidst unfavorable aspects in this world we live in.<//Review><resp>{'time': 1616816701400, 'text': 'Thank you for sharing your experience.

One of the staff  listed her as positive.She was Negetive. This prolonged  her  stay,, having to be tested  again sent home on isolation. This was not professional. Somebody made a grave mistake.

WARNING TO ALL INCOMING PATIENTS FROM THE IMPERIAL VALLEY!

While all the staff are incredibly kind and hardworking, the Administration WILL NOT PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION FOR DISCHARGE PATIENTS. My father had become bed ridden from his dementia and thus could not walk on his own. Administration argued with my mother on how Hospice should be the one the to provide transportation back to the Imperial Valley or we should pay out of pocket ($500 dollars) when since day one they told us Victoria Post would be able to provide it. We ended up bargaining with them them giving us a wheelchair to compromise because at that time we just wanted to get my father home.

The facility staff on hand were a gift. Everyone there was always great help. Always asking if we were comfortable and my father was taken care of. Both me and mother have to give so much recognition to the nurses Richard, Laverne, Elise, and Beth for dealing of somewhat stubborn patient that my father can be.< /review>

<Text>I am a bit disappointed. The staff is small yet there are some things only the staff can perform, especially when it comes to business and placements. This staff led me to believe that I had to pay lots of money and do the placement myself. Social Services informed me that that was incorrect....A person trusts that they are going to be treated and handled professionally  and with integrity. They certainly call when there is a problem...I am so disappointed and just do not trust anything said by this staff.<//Text><user_name>Barbra King< /user_name><rate>2</rate><gmap_id>0x80d959a3490ed753:0x67662cbd52cba207<//gmap_id>< Response>

My 79 year old father had a heart attack that required bypass surgery. After he was released from the hospital he was too weak to return home so the cardiologist recommended a rehab facility to work on his strength. Within five days of physical and occupational therapy he was ready to return home. The staff was great and treated him with respect and provided the care he needed to return to his active life. The rehab staff are all licensed and know their stuff. My father doesn't listen very well and they all took the extra time to make sure he was doing things safe and the proper way. As far as I'm concerned, this facility gave my father his active life back.</Text>

This nursing home is pretty good care wise, nurses and administrator are always on it regarding getting what needs to be done and doing what's best for the patients well being. However, work here is extremely overbearing in sub acute section, too much for one nurse which opens doors for mistakes to easily be made. Rushing is not the way to go and sadly you can't really interact with your patients because you're pressed for precious time. They should really look into this.<//Text>

i had my daughter in law write this post...my son was there for a bit and thank god it was enough to see and to be in disbelief :/ they were good things as well as bad things that went there but people that worked there dont want to listen to the bad things so im going to put them here....we had a meeting with the top people there and yes we gave them the good things that went there but as i see it it was too soon..smh.

negative : giving chocolate cake, paste and bread...to a diabetic is a big no no ( cause it makes its into sugar when consume) and give a fruit punch to a diabetic is also a big no no ....you have to give them sugar free drinks!!! or water!!! nurses there think there doctors by one of the nurses saying to my son" oh here we do things our way" when my son told eric ( thats his name) about his blood pressure and cholersteral need to be taken together, he told him that...thats unprofessional and rude when my daughter in law told the nurses station about that how much he was taking in insulim they told her "were going by what the doctor said" and she told them call his diabetic doctor " dr harris" they said they would and they said that they were going to get back at her , they never did. when the dr danque came and my son told her if she had spoken to his diabetic doctor she told my son that she never got any message or any information what was left in the nurses station ......one thing that my daughter in law said that they had told her that his sugars were high and she brought my sons meter and when the hazel took my sons blood out to check it it was high (348 ) my daughter in law took it out in his and it was 248, there was a 48 differnce...she told that to her she got irrated and said "oh its about the same " nope it is not..excuse me ! i dont know too much about diabetic but my daughter in law does cause she has familiy plus a sister thats a nurse in oregon that worked with people with diabetic..so she knows her stuff.also i have to put this nurses there wanted my sons sugar to go down, how could his sugar go down with all the weird people that had him roomate with, one just wanted to sleep by my sons side and the other one had his friends coming in when they were not suppose too ( the doors closes at 8:00 but someone came in after hours to visited my sons roommate ...another came in at 5:00 ) excuse me ??? were are the security of the patients ???? when i brought this up to the higher people "they claimed they didnt know" ...for me it seems that they are thowning the ball at each other:/ if i had a choice i would have not given it no stars

with all of this they should change and train the staff ( i mean really good) cause seriously its sad that they do things there way and they get away with it....this is not right... thank god my son is home already , and i do want to let people here in victoria post acute  "NEVER ! I MEAN NEVER WILL I HAVE HIM COME BACK OR REFER ANY ONE HERE !!! " its sad how i read in the many posting that people say its a gem of east county , its a great place....seriously i say no it an't!!!  the only 5 normal people there that were nice was rick, vicky , laverne , beth and lily for helping my daughter in law ( when no wanted to hear her).....thank you guys!</review>

Whatever you do please do not put your loved one in this place they almost killed my grandmother. She was only supoose to be there for a couple of days to help her stand and walk again after a fall out of bed, she ended up staying two whole weeks with no rehab what so ever. Her oxygen tube was kinked for at least 3 days before my 18 year old cousin noticed.. staffs only responce was my bad. She has bed sores all over her back side. Her second night there a nurses aid spilt water all over her purposely because she couldn't reach her drink. He also couldn't figure out how to take off her cpap mask. She is now home all her vital signs are stable but she's still afraid to stand because she had been in bed for so long.< /Text>

One star only because I can't rate any lower!!!
Our dad is their and the care is a joke.
He's on no food or liquids by mouth, found him this morning with a banana crammed in his mouth and water running down his neck. He can't swallow or eat. Also he can't move but somehow broke his arm overnight ?

Working here is a no no.
You don't want to get in trouble bc someone else isn't doing their job properly. And your skills are sharp.
Bad place.
Bad pay
Needs to be renewed all over again , from bottom to top.
Inside and out.

<Text>(Translated by Google) Victoria post Acute care does not have enough staff to take care of your loved one, they sent my father to the hospital because they dropped it, which does not justify that they later looked for another place "Nursing home" to be responsible for the . . That Nursing home returns you to your loved one because they cannot cope with their illness and because they do not have enough staff to care for them. , A professionally trained Nursing home has enough trained staff to attend to the needs of the patient.

My father fell three times because of his dementia and UTI. . This should never have happened.

My recommendation is never take them there, look for other nursing homes with more professionalism .👎👎

Victoria post Acute care no tiene el personal suficiente para cuidar a tu ser querido , ellos mandaron al hospital a mi padre que por que se les cayó , lo cual no justifica que ellos después buscaran otro lugar “Nursing home “ para que se hicieran responsable  de el . . Que Nursing home te regresa a tu ser querido por que no pueden con su enfermedad y que por que no tienen  personal suficiente para cuidarlo . ,  Un Nursing home con profesionalismo tiene suficiente personal capacitado para atender las necesidades  del paciente.

Mi padre se les cayo tres veces a Causa de su demencia y UTI . . Esto no debería de haber pasado nunca .

Mi recomendación es nunca los lleves ahí , busca otros nursing homes con más profesionalismo .👎👎< /Text>< rating>

Me and my friend got a pedicure . I got the basic with gel color and my friend got a more in depth pedicure . The lady that helped us was pleasant and there was no wait . Even though I had called in to make an appointment. I will be coming back prices are reasonable and the lady was pleasant I didn’t feel judged lol< /review>

<Text>I had a 4pm appointment but Helen didn’t get to me until 4:30pm. I asked for eyelashes. She quickly placed the lashes (less than 20minutes)  OMG!!! When I say NEVER again. She absolutely did NOT know what she was doing. I don’t know what kind of glue she used... but I promise, it should NOT be used on your eyes. And how she positioned the lashes under my own lash on the inside of my eyes!??!  About an hour after being done, my eyes hurt so bad (itchy and scratchy). I had to keep the lashes for the occasion but after the weekend, I immediately tried to remove them. ALL of my real lashes are painfully GONE. And when I tell you, it has been a week and I still have 4-5 fake lashes on ONE eye... they won’t come off!!! My eyelids are puffy and sore. Not to mention how ridiculous I look. Helen should NOT be providing this service at all. Not to mention the quality of the lashes... stiff like a broom. Just horrible!!! DO NOT GET EYELASHES HERE!!!< /Text>< pics>

I love Club Nail Spa! Wendy is the best by far! I have had my nails done for decades. And they would pop off, turn yellow or break. With Wendy her nails last into your own nail grows out they never lift, they never pop off and I never get a fungus. She goes the extra in cleanliness! Is the only reason why I KEEP GOING BACK!! GO SEE FOR YOURSELF!!! And ask for WENDY. My name is Kim and I recommend Club Nail Spa! You'll be glad you did! 😎😇🤗<//text>

Eventually came in and with attitude. Cut my finger while filing with the drill and I had to wipe blood away a few times. Horrible experience!

<Review>I was gonna get my nails done so one of the ladies asked what I wanted. I showed her a picture and she said. "Okay I can do that except the lines." I said cool no problem. So she started doing her thing. Then she took out the nail drill. She started with my pinky. She gave me a cut so I said ow the cut me. She just looked at me and went to the next nail. That one was fine until she went to the middle finger. She cut me twice. This was my frost time so I wasn't sure If this was normal? So I looked at her like don't you see blood coming out? So I kept saying ow. She did this 2 more times!! Thank god she finished so she started painting my nails.  I showed her the picture again and she told me she couldn't do that design. So I said wait a minute, didn't you say you can do that when we first started? And she stood quiet then she said do you have another choice? So I did. Just put me the word "u.s. Air Force" she tried it on my thumb, and did a messy job! -.- so I just told her paint my nails blue and my thumbs white please I'm done. And not to mention the fact that she was talking across the room with her language. So she never asked me anything or talked to me. Yet, I saw employers there talk to their clients. So I give it a 2 stars because she did paint my nails great! But just the process of getting my nails was horrible! And I totally forgot to ask for her name. -.-<//Review>< name>

The technicians are good...  But... One word..     "87°f"...  And I'm not talking about the temperature of the foot soak..    The room was so hot, that I was literally sweating. They thought opening the back door and getting cross ventilation in would help...  NOT... it was just hot summer desert air.  The girl at the shop didn't get the hint I mentioned how hot it was.

After melting for several minutes, I finally broke down and asked the same girl (manager) if she could turn the air on. She looked at me, rolled her eyes in disgust and walked away to turn it on with out acknowledging me.

<Review>I have done my nails here for a few years, but the last year I stoped going there, there is a bad vive the ladies are defensive all the time, they file my nails to the point of burning or bleeding and they laugh about it, today, I decided to go for again and it was a bad experience, they are in a hurry, in bad mood, they are very prompt to charge but not to give a good service, for that I won’t recommend this place anymore.

Helen did a mani pedi. The foot bath was not clean before she quickly placed a plastic cover inside and the file tools she used on my feet were used on someone already...she tried to defend her mistake once I mentioned the used files. A small red sore developed on the top of my foot the next day. Never Again!<//review>

<review>I will NEVER get my nails done here again. I came here with my 3 little girls and spent over $100 and they couldn't even do my nails right. The lady drilled my acrylic nails sooooo thin that they started breaking the same day. I went back and explained that all of my nails are going to break because they're too thin, and he only fixed the broken one. He told me the rest would be okay, but I knew better, and then the next day more nails broke.</review>< rating>

I got my nails done 2 weeks ago and the nail polish is meh 😑. The day my nails we’re done I can already see bubbles in  like 3 nails . To me nails should last almost 3 weeks , but it’s like they have it to when the nails knows when to get up . Also for $25 dollars the nails are kinda short.</text>

Went to get a pedicure. Not very good quality polish to choose from. But my main disappointment was how fast and rough she did my pedicure. I dont like leaving bad reviews but honestly i’m wondering if she was even licensed. I felt like any minute I was going to bleed from her “cleaning” my big toe nails :(</review>

<name>Quinton Farmer<//name><Text>Terrible experience! Took my fiance there and she asked for coffin cut nails and they gave her these out dated fat ugly nails. When the lady cut them she literally asked them to cut them slimmer but she refused and said she would file them down but didn't.  Rude as hell. Won't be going back! Only go here if you want fat ugly old lady style nails.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>Subway has discontinued the roast beef sandwich and its hard to find a franchise that has it in inventory. I ordered a chicken salad only to find out that there's no Italian dressing and no croutons. The food server was nice about the whole affair and smiled thru out even as I showed frustration.< /Review>< pictures>

I called to see if they had a special deal but he never answered the phone . I came to ask if he had the special they sadly did not however when I was leaving the subway I called to see if maybe he was busy and that’s why he did not pick up the phone I called when I was in the store and he did not pick up the phone still like why do you even have a phone if you can’t pick it up smh . Pick up the phone next time and don’t make me come all the way here to ask a question that’s could of been answer on the phone if you would just pick up 1/13/20 6:44</text>

Service was good and the food was prepped well with the workers listening to the instructions. Pricing structure is the same as always, and its easy to get to. Parking is easy as well, and its a nice place to go after a date at the library.<//Review>

I asked them to put some bbq sauce on my sandwich, which I always get in other stores, and the two ladies that work there asked another guy (I guess the manager) if there was an empty container to bring to the front with sauce.
The guy said they didn't have it, then admitted they did have it, but since it's not on the "dressings menu" he wouldn't give it to me.
Very rude.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

I ordered a carne asada burrito and asked to have cilantro and onion. The burrito had more cilantro, onion, and TOMATOES then carne! I ate what I could of the carne and tortilla but have about a lb of onion, cilantro and tomato’s. My burrito was cold by the time I got it home because of the amount of veggies. BEWARE if you ask for cilantro and onion you will get TOMATOES!</Review>

<review>Sat in drive thru 30 minutes,  ordered an Adobada burrito,  it didn't even come with what the attendant said,  and it was more like cheese melt from taco bell,  a place known for their burritos,  I got a refund and whoever owns this place,  learn how to make burritos,  2nd learn how to efficient, total waste of time and money. Thanks for nothing<//review>< pics>

Most disgusting nachos I've ever had, their pictures lie here's a real picture of their nastiness. Asked for chicken nachos and they gave me shredded pork, idk maybe they thought we wouldn't notice. Not only that they charge over $10 and don't even put that much meat. This place is 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼< /text>

Haven't been to Albertos since I lived in temecula when it was the only thing out in old town, I ordered the asada nachos and was amazed that someone can actually make them terrible, all the chips were over cooked smh.To be fair that's the only thing I got so I'm not sure about the rest of the menu.</Text>

<rate>1< /rate><review>I'm a huge fan of Alberto's since I used to work for one a few years ago and I loved there California burritos, carne asada burritos, carne asada fries & nachos and there taquitos. I decided to swing by this once and get me a California burrito which is a carne asada burrito with fries inside and cheese. Well the burrito was big and looked fresh so I was all excited until I bit into the burrito. They decided to put this red sauce kinda between enchilada sauce and tomato sauce inside the burrito which ruined the burrito. The carne asada also had a lot of fat pieces in it and I was just overall disappointed which I ended up throwing the burrito away. Just the overall burrito had this funky taste and it was the first time i been disappointed by Alberto's in a long time. Also the raised there prices to $9 a burrito because of the meat shortage due to COVID. Which i don't know how true that is because a lot of Mexican restaurants I go to still haven't raised there prices. Hopefully this places gets better but for now I wont come back.< /review>< Pics>

This was a 5-star dining experience. We ordered bean and cheese burritos and tostadas, an asada plate and horchata.  Everything was top of the line.  Keep up the good work!  Our server was Miguel S.<//Review>

My son and I had carne asada tortas but it was mostly beans that tasted burnt. We ordered chips and they were stale. My youngest son's chicken burrito with fajita mix was burnt. My husband's carne asada burrito had a few bits of carne asada here and there. Terrible.</text>

<review>A very mixed review.  Food was good, no problem there.

The problem is time spent in drive thru line.  We got in line at 11:15.  Got to the menu at 1135 (there was one car in front of us at the menu when we arrived).  Placed our order at 11:53.  Finally left with our food at 12:05.
Nearly an hour spent sitting there.

The young man manning the window apologized several times and was very polite.  There only  seemed to be two people there.  I don't know if there was a scheduling problem but something needs to be done.

We will give Alberto's another chance, one of these days.  Maybe.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Literally just finished my food and immediately had to place a review. We LOVE this place!  Yes, their drive-thru can get busy but if it does, hop out of your car, put your mask on, and head inside to order at the counter. 😊 This is not a processed-food assembly line, it is fresh, amazing, phenomenal high-quality Mexican food at a reasonable price.  Consider yourself lucky if you get Chris as your order-taker and cook. He is friendly, professional, always gets our order right, and will take great care of you!  Try this:  potato, egg, and cheese burrito, add grilled veggies and add guac, with green sauce on the side.  You'll think you've died and gone to heaven!  We also love their carne asada burritos and bean and cheese burritos - you can't go wrong here!  If you are vegetarian, they will even sub out potatoes instead of the fish on tacos or burritos.  💗💗😍  Great spot to dine alone or with family or friends!</text>

This place has gone down hill.. Sure, I do understand that due to the Pandemic their prices had to go up on dishes that contain Carne Asada. However, their large/full order of Carne Asada Nachos/Fries have less amount of meat and ingredients; and whatever meat is in the plate is burnt. Very disappointing.<//Review>

This place is disgusting they meat of my order. I just went there and the person who attended us was so unprofessional and very rude he was using his street language to speak to us. Mest up all our orders i ordered 3 chicken plain and and they put alot of pico de gallo. The torta had pork and we asked for chicken and it had shredded cheese<//Review>

<Review>Was very disappointed. Usually go to the Alberto's in San Bernardino, where the food is always good, with large portions. The combination plates appear to made for kids. Crazy especially for the mark up on charges. The beans and rice were not the same quality.  The tacos were good just  tiny. Don't plan on going again.</Review><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

My breakfast Burrito tortilla was like a rubber frisbee. bland tasting, the hot sauce was like watered down red water.  Definitely not worth going back.< /Text>

I went 1 other time and it was great. I went again and it was awful. The prices are on the high side and the beef taco I got looked so small and hardly any meat. I got a refund when I took it back in, but had I not checked my food I would have been out of luck. No desire to go back.</text>

Went to the drive thru and guy answers and says to give him a sec and 10 mins pass by and no answer, kept asking if anyone was there and no response, called to let them know I'm still in drive thru and no answer. Drove around the corner and all the lights were turned off which means they answered and left us in the drive thru. I mean I wouldnt have minded if they had said that they weren't taking orders but definitely not this..</review>

<text>Food was good, this is a service review.
The service however was a complete joke from Jennifer M. We went through the drive-thru, which at this point is already really hard to give a review for drive-thru services, but this takes the cake. Jennifer was so impatient and slammed the window shut while my husband was in the middle of answering HER question. We could tell she was frustrated, so he continued to say please and thankyou even though her service was beyond the worst I've experienced at a drive-thru. Which is saying a lot considering you're talking through a speaker and you pay and you leave. This was just unsettling and suprising that in such a short amount of time someone could be so horrible and leave that much of an impact. Jennifer, you should look into janitorial duties for the place because you clearly shouldn't be trusted to talk to customers as the face of an establishment. This experience has made us not want to return here. We love the food but that was beyond sad.<//text>< Pictures>

I went last month to try them for the first time and ordered carne asada fries and as soon as I got home found them to be super soggy, I know they barely opened so I understand that kinks need to be worked out and the employees are all new and are still being trained. Today I decided to go back and try them again in hope that they have much impoved. I waited at the window for over 20 minutes to not only find out that I was over charged for the wrong item but I've been waiting over 20 minutes for something that they ran out of. I understand that you run out of things but the back of the house needs to communicate with the front of the house when they are out of something so stuff like this doesn't happen.< /Review>

<Review>POOR FOOD PREP
I have been twice. First time they messed up the order completely after waiting in the drive thru for 30 min (only 3 cars) and fixed it. Second time I ordered 2 carne asada burritos. I was served dry old meat. Though offering to make replacement burritos, the Manager was not apologetic and just handed my cash back. I was served dry hard meat. Very disappointed.<//Review>< pics>

< review>
A guy dropped off a menu at my office yesterday letting me know that the restaurant was open. I got some Carne Asada Fries using their drive-thru today. First, the drive-thru window worker could have been more cordial. Second, the fries were soaked in grease a bit too much. The portion size was good though. No sauce or salsa. I guess I should have asked for some, but then again the worker could have asked me if I wanted some also. Well, she didn't; in fact, she didn't speak to me at all. I had to thank her for handing me the food. Hope things will get better.<//review>

<text>I love the one in Moreno valley and Redlands, this one not so much. Let's start by saying I always get the same thing when I go carne asada fries no beans. Well I've been here twice now and the first time there was hardly any meat or cheese ,second time plenty of meat and cheese but the fries were undercooked and the meat had alot of hard nerve endings. I'll be making the drive to Moreno valley until they get it together< /text>< pictures>

<text>I was looking forward to giving this new location a try and ordered a tostada and a beef taco the lady taking the order said they ran out of lettuce. If you run out of something shouldn't you send someone to go get it especially if your open 24 -7 ?? This is bad for a business just opening up with an area full of other Mexican places to eat. I'm headed to tacos & beer now.</text><Time>1566702798752</Time></record></dataset><record>

It's not as good as other locations. The food isn't prepared right, guacamole isn't what I'm used to. I'll stick to the one on Highland in San Bernardino. I have tried the Beaumont location twice. Unfortunately, I won't go back to this one.< /Review>

<review>I had the Salt Lake City Special which is basically an egg scramble. It includes scrambled eggs, sausage, mushrooms, peppers, diced potatoes, and your choice of gravy or cheese as a topping, plus you get toast or biscuit and gravy. This is my favorite type of breakfast when eating out and Amy's did not disappoint. It was really good. The veggies we're fresh, not canned and the gravy had a good flavor and not overly greasy. The server was great as well. She made sure my coffee was hot and full often. Great first time experience.<//review><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>2</Rating><review>Service was awesome! Our server was very nice and was on top of everything.  The atmosphere is cozy like you would expect a small diner to be.  The food is what needed help.  I ordered a couple of the signature items. First the "Truck Stop"
.  It was tasty and I would definitely eat it again.  I also ordered the red velvet waffle.  That was barely warm and almost seemed to be made several hours prior and I just wasn't impressed.  My girl ordered a strawberry waffle and it was bad all around.  The strawberries looked almost brown and she had to send it back and request just a plain waffle.  She also ordered a side of bacon which was also barely warm and looked like it had been prepared several hours prior.  She got scrambled eggs which were cold, over cooked, and looked like they were prepared several hours prior.  To top it off they are cash only.

I was really hoping for another good local breakfast place but, sadly, don't think we'll be going back.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I had an amazing meal the other day at this place. I had a typical breakfast platter that consisted of ham, eggs sunny side up, hash browns along with some sourdough. The taste was like no other, very well worth it. I would definitely recommend to anybody looking for a tasty breakfast.</Text>

4-Stars = Very Good!  A small, efficient, clean, and bright specialty/eclectic cafe.  Good, attentive service, nice dining atmosphere, compliments a diverse, unique menu.  Also, from the time of the order until we had food on the table...QUICK!!!  I went with my wife, along with dear friends that live in the same city as the cafe.

I had a red velvet waffle that came with a soft cream cheese dollop, enough to cover the whole waffle, and a circle of whipped cream around the waffle's edge. It wasn't crispy like waffles should be.  If you want soft...pancakes!  The waffle itself was 2-star fair, but the dollop of soft cream cheese made the whole mouthful 3-star good!  Italian sausage was 1-poor.  Go to Claro's Italian Market for 5-star freshly made authentic Italian sausages of different flavors--sweet, hot, and on Tuesdays or Wednesdays an additional different flavor like garlic.

My wife had crispy French toast that had corn flakes on it.  They were very thick and came with tons of creamy whipped butter with the option of adding single or multiple dollops of strawberry, raspberry, lemon, or chocolate goo!  The sausage was good!

Overall good food, a large eclectic menu, attentive service, fast turnaround from order to food in front of you, and a nice place, makes this place 4-star Very Good!  I shall return and try the myriad of other unique dishes they have to offer!< /review>

<text>I've only taken orders to go here, I'm pretty sure, but it's always been awesome. Go with the breakfast burrito. Huge and filling and freaking delicious. The salsa they use is made right there in the cafe, I'm told. The tall lady that always seems to have different colored hair and long nails and makeup is always nice and helpful when I place orders. Highly recommended.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2d352c463f2ad:0xb9465cef12727e72< /gmap_id></record>

I wish I could give no stars. I had the gran Toronto burrito my wife had the raspberry crunchy French toast combo and we got the pancake combo for our kids to share. The burrito was supposed to be beans, hash browns sausage eggs and cheese there was 75% beans the hash browns we're not cooked all the way and there were maybe 2 sausage links cut up inside with a canned tomato sauce on top cooked with huge chunks of onions and prices of jalapenos and bell peppers. The French toast was soggy and didn't have enough batter the raspberry sauce was too sweet overpowering the dish and the eggs were undercooked in all dishes, supposed to be scrambled but very runny and the pancakes we're overcooked to an almost rubbery texture. Total fail all around, I don't know why people have rated it so well, maybe they don't have knowledge of what good food should be.< /review>

You can drive right by this place and totally miss it.  It's tucked into an average looking strip mall on the corner of Imperial Hwy and Valley View.

I stopped to get a breakfast burrito at a different place while my car was being serviced.  I saw Amy's and figured I'll just try it.  I'm glad I followed my adventurous streak!

It's a nice, cozy little place.  It had great food, and reasonable prices.  Well worth a stop if your in the area.  I'll be stopping again!<//text>

<text>I've enjoyed the food but most times I come any more it's closed, website says open and sign says should be open yet it is closed.  Update the website and hours posted so people don't waste their time and just stop coming back altogether.< /text>< Rating>

<Review>In town from Utah, it was close to the Hotel and we saw the reviews and thought we would give it a try. My son had the raspberry stuffed french toast. He gave it 10 out of 10! I can't remember the name of what I had but it was great and was way to much food. Just a heads up if you have a large group this isn't the place, but if it's 2 to 4 awesome. They need to own up in a bigger place. Food was that good and the people were great!<//Review>< pics>

The coffee was good but my bacon and cheese omelette was overcooked, the hashbrowns were dry, I had to ask for a refill on my coffee and the place was not very busy so I don't think I'll be going back. My daughter said her Crunchy French Toast was good though!<//Text>

Cozy and classic atmosphere, friendly and terrific service, and food that warms the heart and fills you up. They do the traditional breakfast favorites as good as any, but also have a great variety if youre in the mood for something special or different . Also, their bisquits and gravy are easily the best in the area.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2d352c463f2ad:0xb9465cef12727e72<//Gmap_id>< pics>

Nice little place here in Whittier for a great breakfast. From their pancake's to their Kuntry Fried steak and everything in-between, it's all good. Their service is good, their food is better, just expect a wait especially if you're coming in after 10, but don't let that deter you as it is worth the wait. I love their Kuntry Fried steak which has one of the best country gravy I have tasted.<//text>

I went with my family coming from 2 hours away , the food is good . The coffee was cold I had to let them know twice. I asked for jalapeños and received them once I was done with my food 😴 They didn't care if I had a fork or spoon . I ussually get really good service in privately owned restaurants that's why I choose them over chain restaurants. But I can't complain on the food  👌🏻< /Review>

<review>After reading reviews of how long people can wait for breakfast, we decided to get to this place no later than 8:30AM. We sat right away and were served coffee. The staff were all super cool, everyone greeted us when we walked in. I ordered the Grand Torino (I think that was it..) breakfast burrito, my boyfriend ordered the Red Velvet Waffle and a 1/2 order of the biscuits n gravy, his kids ordered a cheeseburger and the biscuits n gravy with sausage. Our food arrived in a good amount of time. My burrito was fantastic, even with the sauce they put on it (I was skeptical on whether I'd like it). Those red velvet waffles though!! Omg!! Those are heaven! The biscuits and gravy were fantastic too! Loved everything!! I'll be back for some French toast and those Chorizo Waffles!!<//review>< response>

<text>The food was good, although it didn't look like they were prepared for the crowd they had, so it took a while for our breakfast to come.

We will try it again and see if that was a fluke or status quo.< /text>< pics>

<Review>Went in to get a smog check directly after taking my car from a week at an auto mechanic's shop, thinking it would be good to go but turns out my engine was overfilled by 3 quarts! Jason was super helpful and went above and beyond to make sure that my car was safe, clean and ready to drive home by draining the oil and power washing it all down after. I am definitely coming back here for future smog checks and would recommend Jason to anyone.<//Review>< Pictures>

< review>
One for the most professional and honest smog shops in the Bay Area. Actually observed him working on other people’s cars. You can avoid some of the biased and subjective comments- he is trying to help some people to prevent them not passing the test and paying extra by giving  them suggestions on required repairs/changes.<//review>

<text>I have an older car (1999) and most places didn’t have the appropriate machines and/or, if they did, I was quickly told that they weren’t operational. In going to EZ Smog, I actually learned that their machine was down too, but Jason made sure he got it serviced quickly, and he followed up with me when his testing equipment was up and running. He performed my smog test without any issue. He’s efficient and clearly knows his stuff! I was super happy with his service and dedication and his willingness to follow-up with me showed that he truly cares about his customers! I’ll be a loyal customer going forward!< /text>< rating>

<Review>He’s really down home and gets the job done.

If it looks like he’s closed. He’s not! Just hop out the car and give him a holler.

He’s been through a lot and it seems has has his life on straight.

Would recommend.</Review><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>I would have given zero stars if that was possible at all. This smog station had earned all its stars thanks to the previous technician Cengiz who was excellent.  The new management is a disaster.  Only go there if you have time to waste and if you enjoy dealing with capricious and unprofessional people. Too bad.< /Review>< pictures>

I was in and out  within approximately 15 minutes, though I did schedule an appointment online. It looks like it may be a one man owned and operated business. It felt good to support a small business especially during the times we are living in, when businesses and people are struggling. The price was affordable compared to other Smog Shops, it was about $57 for my 2012 Ford Focus SEL and I needed a STAR Smog check for my DMV Registration. My vehicle passed🙂. Thank you to the owner/gentleman that did the Smog check.</Text>

Jason is a great guy and knows his trade. He is honest and good. I have a 5 cylinder 2.7 liter Mercedes/Dodge 2005 diesel sprinter, and he knows how to smog them. If you need your Sprinter smogged and others won't or can't touch them. go see Jason.He has the experience. In and Out. Easy Peazy!</Text>

<text>Cengiz had a good sense of humor. He was very quick. I was in and out in about 15 minutes. I don’t do too much smog pricing but make sure you go to his website to get the good deal. Let’s keep it 100 no one wants to pay a lot for something less than an hour and you get once a year.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<review>Owner will try to take advantage of you if he sees he can. He will do a “visual test” vs the smog check, make you pay $80 if you don’t tell him you saw a different price online prior to starting his “visual test”. He demanded I go get a tune-up before coming back based on his visual test and pay $80. After getting a tune-up, he refused to do the test saying to come back a week later. This went on for 3 weeks. Until I demanded he does the test which I had already paid for an overpriced service. I car always passes with no problems. Worst place to go for your smog check, worst experience I’ve had, and what a waste of my time over a span of 4 weeks total.< /review></record>

< review>
EZ Star came highly recommended to me by my husband and a few friends. I was able to schedule a same-day appointment online this afternoon and I arrived a bit early, and didn't have to wait. The technician was fast, friendly, and efficient. As for the cost, I live in Alameda, and all of the test-only centers charge twice as much for the same test. I will continue to get smog checks here, and to recommend to friends. Thank you!!</review>

Service was fast and professional! I needed more data after my first test (my car's computer had been reset recently) and he told me exactly what needed to be done to satisfy the test. Took my vehicle back after driving the recommended 90 miles and passed with flying colors! I highly recommend this shop for its honesty and efficiency.< /Text>

<text>The reviews are right about this person being very amicable, but that does not excuse him of the way he took advantage of my lack of knowledge of how Smog testing works. Because of the high reviews, I went in expecting an honest person who’d give me honest answers.

My check engine light was on and so I asked him before initiating the test if my vehicle would pass. He answered no, but that the Smog results would pinpoint the problem and I would be able to take it to a mechanic to fix said problem without the need of a new diagnostic, so I paid him the $40 plus certificate fee of $8, which he claimed was the cheapest in town (it’s not), as I was goaded to believe that this was the cheaper alternative

Turns out, that was all hogwash, as the repair shop I took my car to still needed, you guessed it, a diagnostic, which cost $125, as the repairman explained to me that the error code given by the Smog results is not specific to what the car actually needs. That said, now I’m out $48 and all because of a dishonest individual.</text></record>

Cengiz is the most honest, easygoing technician I've ever dealt with. THIS IS THE CHEAPEST & QUICKEST SMOG STATION IN THE BAY AREA! Look for how ever long you want. Waste your time skimming thru pages and calling up other spots. But I guarantee you will not find a better deal anywhere close.

Don't let these other reviews poison your idea of EZ Smog Oakland. We all know some ppl who can never be satisfied. Just give this place an honest try. You will not be disappointed.< /text>

Cengiz was great! I called and made an appointment and they fit me in the next morning. In and out quickly and a great price with the yelp deal.

Be warned though - to get the yelp deal pricing, he will make you submit a review on yelp and google before you pay.</text>

Quickly found this place on Yelp, drove over on a Sunday with no appointment, and after waiting a few minutes, was out of there with smog certificate in hand. Price was straightforward, as advertised; No complaints and as others have mentioned, Cengiz was a fun guy to chat with.</review>

THE OWNER OF THIS SHOP FORCES CUSTOMERS TO LEAVE HIM A 5 STAR GOOGLE REVIEW. He would not continue the transaction until I said I would, and then wouldn't check my car until I had follow-through. Once it was done, he helpfully noted my address and told me we are "practically neighbors," so I didn't feel comfortable changing my review to an honest one until after I moved to a different city.

In addition, he tried to change the price on me- argued trying to charge me $80 for a 2015 car, when online the quote was $30.

Forcing reviews then pointing out that he knows where I live is a SUPER UNCOMFORTABLE business practice.</review>

Where to even start?? My brother recommended this place to me and now my whole family brings their car here.

This place is continuously updating itself. The service is always fast and easy. Cengiz is very honest, let's me know the price right away. They have an online booking system. And not to mention clean!

Smog Nazi--I've dealt in the past with the owner--he's cool. But this older dude was, like, before he'd even tested my car, said, "This car no pass smog!" I said, "Well, maybe you should test it first before making such dire pronouncements." (It passed fine 2 years before with the owner as technician.) Well, a code for faulty thermostat came up and he smugly said, "See, I told you it not pass!" THE WORST RETAIL EXPERIENCE EVER. PERIOD.< /review>

Gary's response is disgusting. Keep buying your 5-star reviews with coupons and gifts, Gary. Clearly, you're a house of cards with that attitude.

Plenty of other SMOG options that have the same price or less with better service. Don't support business owners who treat their customers like this.

UPDATE #1: The owner's response clearly shows he's blatantly ignoring an invasion of privacy and harassment complaint. He even links to the evidence. Speechless!

Cross-posting this from Yelp since the owner's response to me was to ignore my REAL complaint and say I'm wrong without acknowledging a real problem. I don't support local business owners who play these silly games with their customers. The owner, Gary,  clearly sides with his rude service technicians, invasions of privacy by his technicians (going through my mail and receipts), and spam calling my cellphone.

There are many other local options that cost the same, use those.

----

This might be the first time I feel compelled to write a review about a business in all the years I've used Yelp.

I schedule an appointment using his website and get a text message confirming this. I arrive 10 minutes early to have my vehicle checked out and the man working asks for my paperwork. I, unfortunately, didn't have it as I knew I didn't need it for a SMOG check. He proceeded to rifle through everything in my glovebox and reading every piece of paper in there that clearly wasn't a registration. I asked him to stop and he continued. This made me very upset and freaked me out a bit.

He then refused to do any work because I didn't have a paper copy of my insurance card. It's the 21st century, I showed him my ID card through my insurance app with all the relevant information and he still refused. He then proceeded to lecture me about how I didn't have my papers and how "crazy" I am. AGAIN, you  DO NOT need any paperwork to SMOG a car!

He was extremely aggressive and nasty with me for some unknown reason from the very beginning. He asked me repeatedly how much I think the service costs. And when I said exactly what it was quoted on the website, he said it was wrong. This guy is the type of person you don't want to be dealing with during your busy day. There are plenty of other options around town that charge the exact same this guy does, do yourself a favor and skip this shop.

For those who don't know, you can SMOG any vehicle without paperwork as was evident by the SMOG shop down the street who confirmed this.</text>< pictures>

<Text>Cengiz is nice and friendly. Smog check went by fast and turned out great. Location is not hard to find. I didn't make an appointment and he took me in right away since it was available. But he recommended me to make appointment next time prior to a visit. Nice, friendly, fast and amusing guy. Highy recommended. Will repeat.< /Text>< Pics>

What a hoot!  I came today to get a simple smog check, I had no idea that I would also meet the funniest attendant here!  He made the visit so much more enjoyable than the previous blah places where I've gone.  Friendly and fast service.  Appoiments not needed but recommended...they get you a promotional gift.  This was also the best price in town.<//text>

<review>Fastest smog check I’ve ever gotten.

Nice and courteous technician, but with a sardonic sense of humor!  Also, if you use coupons from the site it is easily one of the better priced shops in town.  Add to that the fact that you can book a reservation online (not many places that do that for smog check) and you have a perfect combination for get in, get out smog check when the DMV comes knocking.

I was even late by about 10 minutes for the appointment I made and the technician still honored my reserved spot and gave me priority in line.  It was a totally smooth and pain free experience.  If only going to the DMV was this easy!< /review>< Pics>

I’m a working professional with only the weekends to get my errands done. It was so nice to find a place that is open on Sunday to do my smog check and get that off my “to do” list. The bonus is that I made an appointment via the web site and I was done in about 15 minutes. They also have Wi-Fi!!!!!!<//Review>

<Review>Cengiz is great! He was very thorough and explained in detail what I needed to do to get my car to pass the smog check. He also allowed me to come back to re-test and further explained the process. Basically, if you need to have your car smog checked and you’re in Oakland come to Cengiz!<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Quick and easy process. Took my car here before they closed on a Saturday for a Smog test. I quoted the online discounted price and while waiting went to pick up cash from a near-by ATM. Wait was short and all in all the actual test took 10-15 minutes. Nice local spot for those in the Oakland/Emeryville area with great and friendly service.< /Text>< response>

Cengiz was my tech today and did a fantastic job! He was honest and very friendly. I made an appointment through the website and he was ready for me when I showed up. Very nice man, have free wifi and I was in and out in 15 min. Will recommended to my wife and friends to get their cars smoked at this place.<//Review>

<rating>1</rating><Review>If you need a Star Certified type smog for the DMV, it is an extra $20, but that is not stated anywhere on their web site. You find out once you get there for your appointment. Owner and tech are both in the "I'm right, you're wrong" school of thinking. Not worth the hassle at this place.
UPDATE: In response to the owner - the coupon was FROM YOUR WEB SITE. They are in the bait-n-switch biz in terms of pricing. Other reviewers on Yelp have had the same experience. Beware.< /Review>< pics>

{'time': 1519554377087, 'text': 'Hi Sue, you wanted us to match a competitor’s coupon from a different city, 6 hours after you got your smog, and after you posted 1 Star review on yelp.  This is not how price matching works. We take pride in our clear pricing and post it on our website for all to see.  Our record speaks for itself.  Good luck to you.'}< /Response>

Fast and friendly service from Cengiz! I actually had to come in twice—first time he told me my test wouldn’t pass for sure because the dipstick cap on my car was missing—the mechanic who changed my oil last time forgot to put it back in. So I got the part and came back a few days later and passed the test. Cengiz was quick and got my car’s smog check done in 10 minutes! Love his humor too, and of course he honored the internet price. I will come back here for subsequent smog check for sure!<//Text>

Cengiz is the most profesional technician I have ever dealt with. First called him over the phone and he was polite and knowledgeable about my vehicle. Told me to come right over with no wait time and 15 minutes later I’m out of the door. Quick, no hassle and professional. Will bring all of my cars here now. Thanks Cengiz!!</Text>

Appointment set up was easy, and open on Sundays which is super convenient. Need to update their magazines though--they only had AARP. Technician was also hilarious.</Text>

< Review>
I went to get a smog so I can register my new used car. Cengiz helped me. The first thing he checked was to plug the obd2 scanner into the car. It wasn't reading anything. At this point he had a choice. He could have told me fail, go get it fixed, had me pay for the service and ask me to comeback to smog it when it's fixed, or ... say check your fuse, or bring it to your mechanic and bring it back and not charge me. He did the latter. He had suggestion and didn't charge me saving me lots of time and money. I fixed the issue myself and brought it back and passed smog! This is what I consider stand up customer service. I don't know Cengiz, but I do appreciate him. Thank you.</Review>

There is no such thing as a smog check being better than another smog check.  They charge $70 when others can be found for $25.  No brainer< /Review>

<Date>1545241330566<//Date><Rating>5<//Rating><review>Still the best place to take your car for a Smog Check.  I live in Fremont but work in Oakland and I don’t have too many days off so you can imagine getting my smog checked is a hassle that I don’t want to make time for.  I called them in the morning and inquired about the current Groupon offer they were running.  I also explained that I am in a rush and could not make an appointment. The gentleman I spoke with (and who completed my test), Cengiz, was extremely helpful. He told me I could drive over at my convenience and he would take care of my test.  When I arrived there was one person waiting and Cengis was very courteous both to me and the other young lady.  He asked me to wait and as soon as her car was done he took mine.  It was cold outside and he was concerned about me shivering in the parking lot so he insisted I take a seat indoors.

The shop is clean and well lit.  The have a sitting area with. Clean chairs, and magazines for the customers.  They have WiFi available for your use.  There is a nice sized parking lot to keep your car while you wait.  Overall I felt like I brought my car to a family member who was taking good care of me and my car.  This is my second time here and I will be coming back whenever my car needs a Smog Check.<//review>< pics>

It is what it says it is. I called and confirmed that they could do the test that day, they did the test quickly, completed the paperwork, and charged exactly what they said they'd charge in their ad. I couldn't ask for more than that. I'll go back.< /review>

Cengiz is amazing! I was a few minutes early, forgot all my paper work for getting my smog tested and no worries he took care of everything I needed no problems what so ever for the right price. Whoever needs a smog in Oakland done right, make it down here to EZ Star Smog thank you Cengiz.< /review>

<review>This experience has been horrible in the least.  Let's just rattle off why.

1. The attendant was flat out rude.
2. I'm a certified Subaru tech and he tried to tell me he can make an inherently AWD car 2WD to work with the 2WD Dyno.
3.  He tried to charge me double the price than what's advertised on the website. Double price was then justified by commenting in where I lived and whether or not I live alone.

Maybe the attendant was joking, which he tried to do later on, but the arrogance and curt attitude already soiled the experience for me. At least I got out pretty quickly.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Resp>{'time': 1519850936599, 'text': 'Hi Elias, we charge $79.75 + $8.25 state cert fee = $88 for cars older than 1995, since it is a much more complicated smog test.  The price is on our website.  If you can find somewhere that’s willing to smog your older than $1995 for $30, you should go to them immediately before they change their mind.  Good luck to you.'}</Resp>< gmapID>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>If I could give them 0 stars, I would. To avoid having to wait in the drive through, I placed my order online. FYI our city allows indoor dining again. In the conformation email I was told to go to the online order area and pick up my food. Whe. I got there the doors were locked and I was informed, by phone, that I had to get into the drive through line to pick it up which completely defeats the purpose of the online order! After spending 25 minutes in the drive through line they told me my order didn't exist. I showed the conformation email, the manager was called and I found out that they forgot to make it! And then they messed up the order and forgot all the extras that I paid for! Since I was in a huge rush by then, had to get the food to Cottonwood, I didn't check the bags and was thoroughly disappointed when I checked the contents. This was the first and last time I went to Wendy's.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x54d2ecbcf2e7db23:0x283c22683f2efb3f</Gmap_id></record>

<Text>My meal was incorrect and 2 items I had purchased were not given to me. I called and asked to be refunded for just the 2 omitted items and explained that they didn’t give me my full order. The staff just said “why” in a rude manner and acted like it was wrong for me to be asking. The positives are that the service was fast and the food was still well made. Service could be improved< /Text>< Pictures>

Wendy's is the bombbbb. But I mostly go here to pick up orders for Door Dash. When I do though, they are usually very quick, very polite, and have everything in the order correct. I've never had a complaint of bad food or a wrong order when I Door Dash here.< /Review>

The app made it extremely easy to order and pick up with great offers and discount.

<text>I want to Wendy's on hilltop in Redding Ca. They are making people wait 10 minutes at the order screen before they take their order. I was 9 cars back and it had taken nearly 2 hours to get my order. That is poor management period. I ran a restaurant with only 1 other person and it wasn't hard if you have good management.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Review>I was very happy there were still open at 11:30 at night. Unfortunately they goofed up the order. I asked for one chili with cheese and one chili with cheese and onions and I got to Chili's with cheese and onions. Luckily I was not shopping for my friends that day that is deathly allergic to onions. I usually have to go to Burger King for him.</Review><rating>3< /rating>< gmapID>

<Review>Food at lunchtime is hit and miss. Diner time is much better. Manager, older gentleman with a distinguished beard, is a great leader and listens to customer complaints and fixes them smoothly & calmly. I feel if all Managers were like him, working at fast food wouldn't be such a rotten job.<//Review>< pics>

To bad, so sad, went last night wait was long, which we don't usually mind, however when we finally got to the first menu board they were out of the excellent jalapeno bacon burger, out of the bacon jr cheeseburger on the budget menu and also  out of the Jalepeno chicken sandwich. This is at 6pm last night, huh? Not the fastest in town either, but dang out of 3 things? Not our best experience 😢< /text>

<Response>None< /Response><review>I ordered the $5 special, 2 homestyle chicken sandwiches. That was not good enough for these employees, as they had to decide for me. They thought they could force me into purchasing some combo meals, at a much higher price.
I drove away!
I will return only after something changes, but I won't check back to find out, so they simply lost a customer for life.
Maybe wendy's should stop training their employees to question customer orders in such a demanding way. Wendy's deserves to be bankrupt.<//review>< userid>

Yum, yum, yum! Go with the Dave's Triple Burger, OMG. Hold the pickles; why anyone would put pickles on anything! Yuck. The sauce is great. Now make sure to tell them not to burn the fries. To round out the repast, order a large, half and half frosty, (choc/van).< /Review>

< Review>
Food is excellent. Tastes great and it's more real/healthy than most of the competition. Their new breakfasts beat the competition by a mile. Very good! Only issue is this particular location has always seemed rather poorly ran and unprepared. For example, 8am on the debut of their breakfasts, they were out of coffee stirrers. You'd think that for such a largely advertised and hyped debut they would be as prepared as possible. Oh well. The employee was very nice though so that helped.< /Review>

<Text>Since their remodel they are even better. The staff are always great very pleasant. We go regularly because it has great food and hard workers. I highly recommend the chicken bacon avocado sandwich and always substitute the fries for a small chili.</Text>< Gmap_id>

<review>I wish I could say I had a great experience with their new breakfast menu but I unfortunately had a bad one. Today on 3/3/2020 they had several people call out. They were also out of eggs.. Not a good first time. Although they did comp my breakfast for being out of eggs and my wait time of 35 minutes in line, the experience was not a good one. For that I can only give two stars</review>< Rate>

Don't go here much since they remodeled. Very cold atmosphere. Seating had no padding making it difficult to sit and enjoy my food. Now I use the drive thru. Very sad! It was one of my fave places for a quick lunch while running around town</Review>

It's Wendy's. This location usually serves really hot fries so that definitely adds a star but this specific location is kinda run down and a few places in the surrounding area are closed or closing down, lots of homeless in the area. Not that this is Wendy's fault but they could do a little extra to clean up or renovate the location. It's been the same since I was a small child(20+ years) and it's only gotten more destroyed since then.

The staff here is almost always different. Either means a high turnover rate or lots of people doing shorter shifts. This makes for having inconsistencies when ordering food or getting a sauce packet for your food(some people charge you some don't). Also, they have one of those fancy multi-soda dispenser that has the touch screen, that's cool and all but anytime I try to get water it always comes out colored and tasting funny. I tried running the water for awhile to clear out the tubes but still, brown water, residue from sodas and funny taste.

All in all, it's a fast food Wendy's location. Not awful, but not great. Drive-thru is better than going inside because it's so run down. The fries are almost always so hot they burn your mouth, that's a good thing.</text>

Food was fresh and fits the budget (cheap). For fast food salad I enjoy it. Hubby likes their burgers.< /Review>

An unanswered thought I've always had was if the chili comes in shipped in bags and the beef is added in or if the chili is fully made fresh on site. Those frosties tho.<//Review>

Freshest ingredients among fast food options, especially vegetables, can be found here. Easily the costliest of its genre, Wendy's offsets its cheaper competition with consistent  quality standards and unique sides (my favorite being cheese on cheese baked potato).<//text>

The staff was really nice. My mother has medical issues and can be difficult to deal with. They were all just like water off a duck's back. I really enjoyed the salad with the chicken, candied pecans & the pomegranate dressing. Food was really fast being prepared. When traveling would stop there again.<//review>

The waiting line was incredibly long for one car ahead of us for one person in the car. We didn't understand why and then we saw three or four people working inside trying to accomplish very few things. But we love the dollar fries!</review>

Love the chicken wraps. The teas are good different kinds. The prices arent to bad considering other fast foods. There are more healthier options here. Salads and othef yummy items on the menu to try.</Text>

<Review>First time at this location becasue I don't go to Wendys that often. I have to say the service was fairly quick and the salad I bought was good. Since this is the only Wendys left in Redding I will be back at some point.< /Review>< user_name>

Newly remodeled. This was not our first visit. But a nice change. Also purchased a 5$ meal included a burger, fries, 4 chicken nuggets, and a drink!< /Text>

New menu items are decent. I'd recommend you watch the staff prep your meal though. I watched the cashier handle money, touch the computer screen, sneeze, then place his hand inside a full fry container for another customer without washing his hands or using sanitizer.  I informed him that he may want to improve his lack of sanitary practices to minimize spreading disease or illness. He looked shocked that he was informed.  Possibly lack of training he received...sadly, I think he was training someone else...</Text>

I enjoyed the food...The gentleman that took my order was very pleasant...The very cute girl that gave me my order was very rude and her rudeness took away ALL of her cuteness...She differently needs some customer service training.<//text>

Food still good...... fries a tad soggy..... nothing but young kids on staff....... understandable but when my family and I go through the drive thru and half my order is wrong and missing..... had to go back for them to fix my 50 doller order...... staff member cut in front of me to order there food.......so I can ask for my food the new guys can fix....... I ask for a new drink and a plain cheeseburger for my dog...... had to pay for it...... this needs to get fixed quickly....... I love wendy's...... but get it fixed.......please........ I'm very disappointed........ your store keeps going down the steps....... were the roaches are......🤬< /review>

Never had such horrible Wendy's before. Chicken nuggets were stale and looked like cheap freezer burnt store bought ones. Fries were too cold, burger was not plain like I asked. And the soda was flat.< /review>

I love Wendy's, but the one in Redding on Hill Top is just plain bad. They messed up my food order two or three times . They are not consistent in the taste of their burgers. I will never go back. However the Wendy's at hiwy 5 and 505 is the best. Probably because they do so much business.<//text>

< review>
The restaurant was almost empty and it took 3 people on staff, including a manager strongly scolding(yelling at) her staff, nearly 8 minutes to get us two salads and a kids 2 pc chicken meal. The manager lost our ticket and ended up getting our order wrong making it take even longer to get our order right. I wish Wendy's International, LLC all the luck trying to keep this Wendy's restaurant open with service as it was tonight.<//review>

Wendy's got expensive, and the quality didn't go up. If you're eating low carb (keto) they have good options, but expect to pay double that the carb eaters pay. So many better low carb options in Redding, go someplace else.</Text>

<review>We only have one Wendy's in Redding California .
the old original one on the old side of town shut down .
but the one we have the food is really really good and fresh.
but you do tend to have a little bit of a wait so if you go there have a little extra time but the food is worth it🍔🍔🍔</review><user>118413141175174500133</user>< date>

Pretty quick service. The order ahead of us was taking longer on our last visit (drive thru) so they brought it to us at the payment window so we could leave sooner rather than wait.< /Review>

Its true they are worthless meth heads.   I never even got a chance to order.  The crack head at the register i was at to order left and did not come back.   They wouldn't take me in the other line but let the others in that line cut in front of me.    I used to work at Wendy's it was pretty good. Organized and efficient service and friendly competent crew.  i cannot believe how bad it has gotten since then.<//Review>

<username>ash ramirez<//username><Time>1524549402833< /Time><review>If I could give ZERO stars I would. Some of the rudest customer service I’ve ever received. I think there was a power outage in the area, so when I pulled up most of the lights weren’t on. HOWEVER, I COULD LITERALLY SEE EMPLOYEES STANDING RIGHT IN THE KITCHEN. They didn’t even acknowledge me, I was purposely ignored, got no communication about an outage, and I am 100% sure they saw me. Had to find out from a different drive through.<//review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>We were told it would just be a minute to take our order. We were the ONLY ones in line to order. Five minutes later...no one else is in line, at least six employees behind the counter and no one has offered to take our order yet. No one even looked like they MIGHT want to help us.  I politely asked the manager and she said "It's first come, first served." Does that mean they don't take any new orders until all orders before that are served?! Funny way to run a business. Needless to say, we went elsewhere and won't go back there.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

We are from OH, the home of Wendy's and it is AMAZING! Quality, fast, hot and yummy. So disappointed with the Hilltop Dr. Wendys. We have been through the drive thru at 5 different times throughout rhe year and EVERY time, we wait for 15 to 20 minutes with only 2 to 3 cars in front of us and then 5 minutes at the window! 4 out of the 5 times, our fries have been cold and soggy! And when they say "we are waiting on your fries" at the window and 5 minutes later come back with stale or cold ones??? Needs improvement or corporate should pull them... not an accurate version of the real deal. No wonder it is never packed!< /text>

<Review>The food is really good, but someone needs to teach them about customer service.  This is the second time we came to eat, only to find the door locked.  Management can't be bothered to show their customers the courtesy of a simple sign:" Sorry, we are short handed so only drive through is available today."  Instead, they just lock the door so customers have to park, mask-up, walk to the door and discover it is locked with NO explanation.  While sitting in their parking lot, eating, we counted 10 customers attempt to enter and then leave.  Only 3 customers got back in their cars and went through the drive thru, including us.  Show a little courtesy!<//Review><user>101220153190053671511<//user><time>1623786207953< /time>< GmapID>
