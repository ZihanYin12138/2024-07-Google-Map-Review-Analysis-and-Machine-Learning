Nicest facility in town!! The staff is top notch and they really go above and beyond to make sure we are happy and taken care of! The lady that lives on site should get a raise, she is the best, she always offers us cold bottled water when we go in to pay our units! I will rent more units as soon as there are some in the size I need available again. I always feel safe when I am there as well. Our units have alarms that will go off if the correct pin was not entered. Excellent,  very very clean, temperature controlled facility. 👍</review>

Alex is beyond amazing! Our search for a household storage was a breeze. Very professional, clean, bright and we have the confidence that our personal belongings are safe. He showed us different options that fits our needs. They have climate-controlled and outdoor storage. So happy to have found this storage facility.< /review>

These guys are awesome to work with. Ruth has been so helpful and quite professional. She proved to be an unvaluable asset as I was making decisions regarding what unit to rent. It is not always that someone puts my needs ahead of their business. I recommend without hesitation and reservations<//text>

This place is by far one of the best facilities in Rancho Cucamonga (very new facility).  And on top of that, over $100 cheaper than all the other rundown places.  Also, with the outstanding service from the two young ladies there, handsdown the best place to go!<//review>

This is the Cadillac  of storage places. The units are clean and temp controlled and the entire place is in a safe area right across from the post office.
The best thing about store and lock  however. Is management
Ruth is so kind and helpful. When we were moving out we had to leave one box on the stair landing. When I  called the next day she said that she had moved it back into the unit and put her own lock on it until we could come back. She said it was filled with pictures that she was sure I wanted to keep!
A great place to do business when you need storage.< /text>

By far the best experience you could have at a storage unit place! Ruth has been very helpful since day 1 she's the mgr super sweet and was very patient in helping us find the right unit for our needs. We had gone to see other places but either they didn't seem to want to help much (bored at their jobs?) Or we just didn't like their location/set up. I highly recommend Store n lock in Rancho, we actually ended up renting a 2nd unit recently to really declutter our garage and keep it simple at our house. Also their prices are very competitive and sometimes even lower than other locations. Check them out!</text>

Climate controlled rooms is a big plus. Best “bang” for your buck. I highly recommend them.<//review>< pictures>

< Review>
The employee Ruth , she was the best and one of the incentives of me choosing stor n lock.

Ruth is personable, she saw my hesitant regarding the pandemic, where as she says this is a clean ink pen when I sign the contract. She found a storage that was near enough for me to walk to it without my Walker.

Also, the storage area is the right size and clean.<//Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>This place is open on Saturday when most places are not. Alex and Amanda AR Pleasant, professional and pleasant to do business with. The place is clean and secured in a two-point authorization process. When you arrive and enter your code it enables your storage door to be opened without an alarm. Then when you leave and enter your code the alarm is reset for your storage area.

Managers live on the property so they always know who's coming and who's going.  This is an added security measure for those who are concerned.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

We found this place on yelp and came in to look for a storage facility for an extra car. They found one for us and the service here was amazing! The units are well maintained  and the premises looks great and very safe. They found a unit for us and worked it out for us. I highly recommend StorNlock for your storage needs.<//Text>

<Review>I think I hit a Gold  Mine on yesterday. I  I visited Stor N Lock in Rancho Cucamonga on Arrow Route on yesterday and was quite pleased.  It was very clean with Sanitizing Gel on counters and COVID-19 practices were observed making for a less anxious and safe experience. Ruth assisted me and was most cordial, polite, kind, knowledgeable and sensitive to my time.  She shared insight with me that I had not considered which permitted me to select the perfect storage unit.  I definitely rate it a five star and would recommend it to all.
FYI:::As I was waiting in my Social distance space away I overheard a you man checking out of his storage unit.  He shared with Ruth how pleased he had been with Stor N Lock while using their services and that he too would definitely use them again if he ever had need.  I don’t think anyone would make a mistake in using them when in need of a storage unit.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Walked into this storage facility late in the day, on a Friday night, trying to find a unit.  I was greeted by Alex who was very friendly and able to show me various units with reasonable pricing. I was able to get a unit for a great price. Thanks Alex for all your help.</Review>

Liz is Amazing! I give her 5*s! She is always friendly, helpful and efficient. What a joy to work with. She has been with Stor-N-Lock quite a while, and is a pleasure to work with.

The new management could use a little customer service assistance. Seems as though it's all in the bottom line and lacking in customer relations. Hope they can work it out.

When you've had a great experience with a company, this is very disapointing.< /Text>

<Review>This place is tops in my book, I store at a few facilities and this place is kept in tip top shape.  Well worth the value, I never have a hassle nor need to worry about my stuff.  Jim and his wife take great care of everyone that walks in the door till they move out and even then can be relied upon for help or answers.

Great job folks.

<Review>This place has underground units that are climate controlled and kept in pristine condition.  They are managed by the sweetest people I think I've ever encountered.  When I was moving in, it was a scorcher of a hot summer day.  I stopped in to the front office, and right away was offered ice cold bottled water for myself and several more for my friends.  As if that wasn't nice enough, the lady said she would bring us more if we ran out.....and actually DID!!  If I could move in with my stuff, I totally would.  Highly recommended!!< /Review>< rating>

< Review>
Rat infested! How do I get a hold of Corporate Office?! My unit has rat droppings through out my entire storage unit. Wow! They gave me 1 month free rent. That doesn't even begin to cover the damages.Thought it was clean and reputable. Give me a corporate office number were I can reach someone not a bogus email address. I've read the review that states Corporate does not respond. Customer service Please!!!!<//Review>

What I like most is that it is clean, have seen some in very poor conditions. Price is good for what I get.     The managers are also great and very personable. I have been storing her for the last 7yrs and will continue to do so.

<Review>I put my household items in storage here while I was on rotation in the western U.S.  The storage site itself is underground at is almost like leaving my items in an underground wine cellar.  I have rented storage sites before at different places - and have seen rodents, etc.  I have never seen a rodent, and the place is always immaculate.  Not only that, when I was moving things in late by myself one night when my movers flaked, they let me come in after hours.  And, they are always ready with an ice cold bottle of water and a chocolate.  Can't say enough about these folks -- the managers, the employees are all AWESOME!!!< /Review><Response>{'time': 1445284679506, 'text': 'Thank you for the review!

I've had a unit here for about 5 or 6 years, and have rented additional units for special events on a short term basis.  The space is always spotless, climate controlled and very, very secure.  No one else the area compares!  We loved the old owners, and I haven't met the new ones yet, but I can tell the facility has maintained the quality we've come to expect.</Text>

We have been customers of Stor-n-lock for many years. They have been extremely helpful and accommodating. They keep the place clean, always have some candy and have cold water when we need it. Please consider them when looking for a storage unit.</review>

<review>Horrible customer service! I went to store N lock to obtain a unit there I paid and received a unit asked the manager Carole if I could check out the basement because she didn't show me down stairs she said yes, then realized the unit I purchased was going to be to small for me so I took it upon myself to just look with my eyes (I did not touch a thing) at the other empty units. I was just about to go ask Carole if I can switch units, Carole and her husband come marching down the hallway like if they where going to attack me yelling at me and my wife for looking in the basement (She said I seen you on the cameras and you cant be walking around here). I knew there was cameras I wasn't going to do anything (I wanted to use the storage facility) and I asked her before proceeding anyways she kept attacking us saying we look "suspicious" and that we cant walk around and blah blah blah overall they where very rude they did not need to talk to there customer this way! after all this I decided to get a refund I did not feel like my belongings would be safe with Carole as a manager going here was a huge waste of my time! DO NOT RECOMMEND.< /review><resp>{'time': 1626980897697, 'text': 'Hi amandabitzful, we regret to see that you had a negative experience with us but would appreciate the chance to turn it around.

I have a need for secure storage as well as general storage.  I found the Stor-n-Lock Self Storage facility in Rancho Cucamonga as both a new storage facility and as an eventual replacement for another storage facility nearby that is not nearly as nice.  The corridors are neat and clean, the lighting just right and access is extremely easy.  With the alarm system in place, I don't worry about my property as I might somewhere else.<//review>

Not the best service. I had a horrible experience here. I came based on all the great reviews but very disappointed. Google review from a year ago is accurate. I don't recommend this place. If I could give zero I would.< /text>

I LOVE the staff.  They are courteous and genuine, and they provide such wonderful service.  The place is always tidy as well.  You can't go wrong with Stor-N-Lock Rancho Cucamonga.  Thanks a bunch from your neighborhood CHP tenant. :)< /Text>

< review>
This is THE BEST place to go for a relaxing massage.  You stay clothed (unless you pay for the more expensive massages in the closed rooms) in a relaxing room with others.  A "foot massage" includes about 30-40 minutes on your feet and some work on neck, back, arms etc for a total of 60 minutes.   It is best to call on your way because sometimes they do get crowded especially when people get off work or on the weekends.  An hour massage for $25-30 is a steal.  I always tip about $10. They deserve it.  Sometimes I get better massages here than ones I pay $85 for.</review>

Worst massage ever. Very painful massage. The man got on top of the massage table and was very forceful. He did not stop even when I asked. It was very uncomfortable, there were times when I felt I could not breath. He lowered my yoga pants several inches and raised my shirt without asking. I would not recommend this place unless you like to be tortured. NEVER going back.</Review>

I get it was our fault and time management,  he was just flat out rude and i have never been so disrespected in my life by someone I was giving money and business to. I highly advise to not do business with them EVER!.. RUDE RUDE RUDE.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

The facility is top notch and the service was excellent. The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming to first time clients. The salt cave was so relaxing and I'll be back to try the float tanks next!!!</review>

<Text>This was with the most relaxing time of all time the people that work there were extremely friendly very helpful explain everything about the float tanks and I would highly recommend it I felt so peaceful when I came out I will do this again I will highly recommend other people to do this if you have any stress that you're dealing with float state is a place to go and a float tanks for one hour session will be the most relaxing time and afterward you get tea<//Text></record>

What a magical experience for my 3rd  time here. I drive out from West LA, even in rush hour traffic..and I wouldn’t have it any other way. From James, to Marina to CJ and all the rest of the team, who are all so welcoming and wonderful. You have so many therapeutic options all under one roof. The parking is super easy. I highly recommend this to anyone who is either an avid floater, or someone who is looking for another way to set your mind and soul free...with just salt, water and breath. Thank you James! See you soon. 🙏🏼< /review>

This place is AMAZING!!! We just walked right in hoping to learn about the place and book a future appointment. What was awesome was they were able to book us a float tank session right away. The staff was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. The staff makes you feel so comfortable here as well. Every room and bathroom is spotless clean. I’m 35 weeks pregnant and the FLOAT TANK was unbelievable! I encourage any pregnant mama to try it out. All the heavy feeling I carry day to day just melts away when your in the tank, most relaxing experience I’ve had. I can’t wait to come back!! A little side note is they offered us a demo to another service they have here. My husband was able to try out their THE LUCIA N°03 HYPNAGOGIC LIGHT MACHINE. My husband felt extremely relaxed< /text>

An amazing experience...
I did the recovery package; cryotherapy, infrared sauna, and sensory deprivation. I had a very relaxing experience, I felt safe and in a state of peace. The staff is very friendly, caring, and knowledgable. James helped me through my entire session, making me feel welcomed, calm, and in a safe space. The space is very clean, well cared for, and designed to help you relax. So grateful for the experience, I look forward to my next session.
Day two, I’m feeling great mentally and physically. I slept so well, it’s been awhile since I’ve felt so tired and slept without reawakening in the night.< /text>

Such a relaxing experience. The whole place feels zen and calm. Great energy and the attention to little details did not go unnoticed. (Crystals, music, tea/water, shoes off) I did the salt float and found it healing for mind and body. I went in a bit skeptical and not expecting much but I was very pleased and would love to go back.</review>

<Review>Floating, oh wow , floating. I like to try new things and am I glad I tried that. James was amazing and great to speak too. Full of information and genuine care.

I would wholly recommend floating. I can honestly say that I can see me doing this for my own mental well being..

I'm still enjoying the after effect.

Thank you James and ill be back soon.</Review>< pics>

I fractured my spine when I was a teenager and have chronic pains and aches in my lower back. Two weeks ago I floated for my first time, and I've felt little to no pain since. I'm planning another visit soon. I am very glad to have found this place and would recommend it to anyone. Thanks Float State.< /Text>

Today was my first time at Float State. I bought the groupon for the salt cave. I didn't know what to expect, but the staff was helpful. Everything is very clean. I wore comfy clothes and removed my shoes before entering the room. The temperature was perfect, the lighting amazing, and within a few moments I was blissfully at peace. I believe I even dozed off. It felt like a spa day. There was a soft knock at the door when my session was over. Afterward . I was shown the lounge in the rear where I enjoyed a cup of warm green tea and spent some quiet time journaling in the books provided.  I can't wait to return. Next time I want to float. Thank you for your service, calm, and cleanliness.<//Text>

<review>Planning on returning here. Absolutely loved the vibes I got. As soon as I entered I felt like I left the chaotic environment we live in. First time going into a halotherapy session.. it was very relaxing. One thing I really liked was that you get your own private room. Upon completion an employee did knock politely and advised session was over. I was not rushed at all. I definitely want try a float session and of course a yoga class. It is located in a shopping center so if you do have an appointment arrive early it does it busy and makes it difficult to find close parking. Aside from that I do recommend this place. Staff is really friendly and the area and room are clean.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPH7HqM_JspggbNCDzoRtbvf8qAaA15_gALnTC-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1562014876994, 'text': 'Thank you for your thoughtful review Carla.

< Review>
WOW!!!  I finally tried Float State and I'm so happy I did! I was hesitant, I don't know why but just couldn't imagine "floating" for an hour. My husband surprised me for our anniversary and booked us there. We sat in the Salt Room for an hour which was super cool. We chatted and relaxed. Then we did the "float". Just relaxed (no chatting lol) and floated for an hour. It was all pretty cool and we felt great after! Bonus: my skin and hair are super soft now!!! We will be back!< /Review>

The staff and environment are so pleasant that I felt as a guest in a dear friends home. I must go back and experience more of what Float State has to offer...</Review>< time>

<text>This experience was absolutely life changing and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to meditate and find a peace of mind they didn't know they needed. Couples floating session made me feel closer with my husband! Being alone with your thoughts and focusing on yourself as a person and understanding makes life easier and clearer.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><userid>108496947883715880943<//userid><Name>Natasha H<//Name>< rate>

Upon arrival the atmosphere was very inviting and the staff was very open to going over any and all questions, as well as giving a brief walkthrough of what to expect during my Float session.  The facility has a wide variety of therapeutic amenities ranging from light therapy, to Float therapy; therefore making themselves a one stop shop if you are in the market of trying a wide variety of therapeutic experiences.  Lastly, the facility is very clean and I consider it a great overall experience!<//text>

Then my son had a back injury due to football and we were referred to try their cryotherapy. I took him in and started asking questions about what they offered. The cryotherapy didn’t help his injury, but he like it and it was the sauna they offer that did help him to recover. That started my husband and I going to the sauna once a week and we absolutely LOVE it. I’ve never been in and sauna and was pleasantly surprised to feel the detoxifying effects!!!! I can’t describe it! But it feels amazing!!!!!! We go now once a week! I’m anxious to try other services as well! The people their are very courteous and the facility is very calming!

TIPS for first time couple floaters: when you are floating careful when you move, even small movement may make the water move and get into your partners eyes lol and if you don't want to use the vinegar ear wash, if you get water in your ears, use hydrogen peroxide as ear drops leave in for a 2 min and drain out.<//Review><Response>{'time': 1555783727941, 'text': 'Thank you for you five star review!

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I suffer from a rare genetic disorder, called ”Fabry Disease.” The disease affects all the vital organs, such as the kidneys, heart, and brain, to name a few. With the disease comes some very difficult symptoms. I normally would get Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT), I used to get them but unfortunately I had severe anaphylactic reaction. Which led me to have to be admitted every Friday at the hospital to get the ERT which would last from 7:00 am until 8:00 pm, my Geneticist who is just a wonderful blessing in my life has been nothing but supportive and has collaborated with other doctors to try and figure out how I could receive the ERT without the severe reactions. Last September of 2017, I had a life-threatening reaction that ended me being in cardiac ICU and being intubated. Since then, my doctor and I have agreed to hold off on any ERT infusions, until something else comes along. In the meantime, I have had to try and learn how to cope with the excruciating pain and other symptoms from the disease.

Earlier this morning on November 30th, around 1:30 am, my body began to overheat. My organs feel like they are cooking from the inside causing me to be in excruciating pain. I was not able to reduce the overheating until 7:00 am. This left me in severe pain and I was barley able to walk. My entire body is extremely sensitive to the touch, my body is beyond exhausted, and every part of my body is extremely sore. I have been drinking a lot of water to keep hydrated and I have an appointment to float at ”Float State” in Corona. I wanted to share with everyone that this place is amazing, the owner is so compassionate, the staff is beyond helpful and friendly, and they are doing wonderful things at ”Float State.” They have Halogen Therapy, which is a salt room to help individuals with skin disorders, asthma, and other breathing disorders. I have gone and it has helped with my asthma. They have an infrared sauna which helps to sweat out the bodies toxins (but this is definitely not for me since I am unable to sweat). They also have Cryotherapy, which I have not tried yet, but if they were open at the time when my body was overheating, I would have definitely gone and tried it.

I Would also like to share with other patients that live in the Inland Empire, that I truly believe that they too would benefit from floating. I was skeptical at first, I tried it the first time and I did not really see any benefits, the second time I tried it, I thought I saw some results, but I thought it was all in my head. By the third time, I truly saw the benefits from floating. There was a grey film over my chest after floating and I came out of there with a majority of the pain substantially decreased. It did not take the pain away completely, but the result was incredible. I have floated for a total of four times (five once I complete today's floating session).

I tried to view it from a logical perspective, but the more and more I thought about it from a logical standpoint, it didn't make sense. It is something that requires to being open-minded and thinking outside of the box, viewing it from the outside common sense.

I will follow up and share with you all how I feel after today's float.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I had an amazing experience here. I had a veneer pop off and they took me in the next day for the fix! They’re an amazing team, and made me feel very welcome. Between getting a very timely call back from Valerie and she even greeted me at the door by name. Checked me in and i got called back right away! The assistance from Joy and Dr. Dennis was great! . They answered all my questions and made the process very easy. I can’t wait to keep going to them. They’re my new place to go for all dental needs! Highly recommend!< /Text>

Dr Dennis was my dentist many years back when I lived in the area, I recently started going back to him because of the consistency and quality of care. I like someone who knows my teeth and having the same hygienist for most/all appointments. I also like someone who runs on time and has a great support team. Dr Dennis is all that and more.< /Text>

< Review>
Dr. Dennis and his staff are EXCEPTIONAL! Very honest, helpful, and courteous. You’re not going to get the run around like you will at other places about how much work you need done (when in reality you don’t). You will get the honest truth. Dr. Dennis, Joy, and Valerie you guys are the BEST!</Review>

<Review>I had some pain and called for an appointment.  I was able to get in the next day.  My exam was amazing, and my cleaning was done by one of the most professional and caring hygienist I've ever had clean my teeth.  The one filling I had to have was done was completed painlessly and that includes the shots.  Dr Dennis is one of the most knowledgeable professionals I know in his profession.   You've got a patient for life.   Thank you and take care.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>Excellent cleaning from Ashley today! Very efficiently used her time. Great personalized care. Valorie, Joy and Dr. Dennis all took a moment to say hello as well and wish me and my family a Merry Christmas. Love this office! Never going anywhere else until they all retire!</Review>< Pictures>

I wish Delight charged me for ONE long visit instead of 2 , now I can only go for my next visit in 6 months (January) instead of after 4 months. I cannot afford out of pocket visits.
I am back and my new hygienist is excellent. She does a good cleaning job and explains what she is doing along the way. I have enjoyed talking to their receptionist, she is as funny as I am.
I recommend Dr. Dennis to anyone who needs help with their teeth, they only do what is necessary to keep your teeth healthy.

Dr. Dennis and his staff is very friendly and knowledgeable! I was running a little late and they did their best to accommodate me which I appreciated very much! Dr. Dennis also took the time to answer all my questions. Dr. Dennis made sure I was adequately numb and the procedure was painless.< /Review>

I’ve been going to Dr. Dennis for 15+ years. He is an excellent dentist and his staff are great! Can always trust them with my oral health. Delight my dental hygienist is amazing.

I went to two other dentists...they looked at all my teeth....the tooth ache...well it was a cracked tooth. Dr. David misdiagnosed it completely. Didn't miss charging me though. When I got dental insurance they ran up the bill on the x-rays....without checking what the insurance would cover....which was very little. I got stuck paying for all the x-rays. But wait....that's not all...I slow paid him for his crappy services and he sent me to collections for $98. Wow....that hurts my credit and financial well being. What happened to the caring Seventh Day Adventist dentist? Make way for another money grabbing guy. Really? Really? By the way, the other dentists check all my teeth and at this point seem to care.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1511987311468, 'text': 'Mike, we are sorry that there were misunderstandings when you came in for your visit last year. Unfortunately insurance companies never guarantee us nor the patient payment in full for treatment. We always welcome questions or concerns regarding any bill and we had sent you many notices requesting such.\nDr. Dennis made notes on your visit date that he was unable to diagnose the tooth in question and that he referred you to a specialist to evaluate it. That doctor deemed it to be fractured, upon which you were referred to another specialist to have it taken care of. He also made note that there were no other areas of concern on any other teeth at that time.\nWe are sorry to lose you as you were a valued patient here with us. We wish you luck in your future dental endeavors.'}</response><gmapID>0x80dcabbfd0dd532d:0x9bafc45bf76775</gmapID></record>

Lousy staff....I made an appointment for 1:00 and Dennis David left early for the day and did not call and let me know that the appointment was cancelled. I drove 30 miles and dealt with lying staff that said the appointment was for 12:30. Poor communication from this office. I asked the staff to ask the dentist to at least return my call some time today for the 1.25 hours of wasted drive time and cost of gas for a veteran. The return phone call some time today was also denied!<//text>

I had a dead battery. Daniel helped me efficiently and kindly. He showed customer service skills and kindness.   He was a genuine hero to me today.  Thanks Napa for hiring a GREAT employee who CARES about your business and reputation.  Daniel was sharp, quick without rushing and well spoken.  He provided safe “SOCIAL DISTANCING “ without paranoia.   Really appreciate you all!!!< /text>

I bought a  alternator  From a Napa  in Hayward and all I wonted to do was return the core charge which was only 22 dollars  the lady behind the counter told me she didn’t won’t return the core charge because she was going to eat the cost of 22 dollars okay no problem I’ll never buy anything from this Napa in Manteca  I’ll just warranty  my parts  here   I won’t spend a dime in this place</Text>

< review>
I have purchased parts from other stores and even online and - while Dutch was very helpful and a pleasure to work with - the parts are far more expensive than they should have been. The only reason I shopped here was because my friend is a mechanic and they shared their 40% discount with me. I will not be shipping here again.</review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Napa auto parts has been on main street for years. My grandfather goes their for all his car needs, so my family and I go there as well. My fiancé whole family goes there as well. Mike is the owner and he is more than efficiently knowledgeable in his products. He has many options of brands and products, and is willing to order parts to the store for you. He has let me return parts that I opened and we're not the right size and replaced them. He cares about his customers.<//Text>< Pics>

When it comes to car parts, these people know what they're doing. They've been working with auto parts for 30 plus years, while people at AutoZone haven't even been working for 30 minutes with auto parts. I rather go to Napa and possibly be taught something new than to go to AutoZone and possibly end up being the one teaching them something new.< /Text>

They are not very into customer service.  Happy when you buy something, but it is the end of the world when you return defected parts.  Also Napa Auto is not a chain so where you buy is where you have to return.<//text>

Came in on a Saturday afternoon after work and wasn’t looking my best but was still greeted warmly and professionally.  Bradley really took his time with me in finding a gift for sister, she loves it and I couldn’t be happier.  I’ll definitely be coming back!</text>

Love this store!! The personnel here is always super friendly,  and never a dull moment.  They always go the extra mile to make you feel welcomed and never pressure a purchase you're on the fence about whether you need that additional bag. By the way the answer is always yes you do need that extra bag ;) Edna has been a great contact at this location and she truly go above and beyond to bring in product you want to purchase that may be outside of your area. Can't say enough great things about the Gucci in the Beverly Center, because words can't describe the fun and light atmosphere you feel just as you enter.< /text>

Called multiple stores looking for a particular item when it came out and Tony from this store actually took the time to call me back, show me photos, and was really patient with me. From him initially calling me to let know I’d be receiving pictures of the item I’d called about through text, super responsive with his text messages, very sweet and so helpful.. I purchased the bag without hesitation! Tony wasn’t pushy by any means, he knew what I wanted and remembered me and called me when it was ready! I love that! And now he knows my style so I know he’ll keep me in the loop so I don’t have to worry about missing out on something I would love because I’m not paying attention to when new items come out at the moment.< /text>

<text>The worst experience ever, I Purchased a Gucci sweatshirt for $1200 from this store and when I went back to exchange it with a hoodie and pay the price difference they wouldn't do it for me. I had the sweatshirt, the tags, the receipt and the Gucci bag and I was within the return and exchange period. The conclusion is you buy something from here and come back tomorrow to return or exchange it they wouldn't do it for you so basically if you want to buy something from here it's a one time purchase. There is no return or exchange. Another thing not to forget to mention is that they're super nice to you when you buy, but when you try to return or exchange they're behavior is not the same and they treat you so poorly. Buy anything from this store at your own risk. They're giving Gucci a very bad image<//text><response>None</response><Rating>1< /Rating><time>1583434374667< /time>< name>

Made a purchase in July of this year. While I was waiting for the payment to be processed, the sales lady offered us water and said we could have a seat in the section where the shoes were. While waiting for her to return I noticed that a salesman in the front positioned himself so that he could keep his eye on us and another walk slowly by us starring and then eventually slithered back and asked if we were being helped. Perhaps they should have training on how to approach people. Why not ask the sales lady if she was helping us.  The sales lady was very nice. Do you have to look or dress a certain way to enter this store? Will NEVER GO TO THIS STORE AGAIN!!</Review>

Had a very weird customer service experience here. I travelled from Utah to LA just for shopping high end brands. The guy who was helping me made me feel so uncomfortable. I asked if I could try the Gucci mules  and i wanted to try them with my socks on because i didnt want my feet touching shoes i didnt buy. But he demanded that i take my socks off to try them. He was really rude when he said that. It rubbed me the wrong way. Would never shop here.<//Review>

<review>This store is the worst. Full of snarky, rude personnel. Took a belt in for repair in February. By June it was lost and couldn't be recovered. The manager, Cindy, told me that if was normal for a repair to take up to 18 weeks for some repairs,  it it was obvious after shuffling and mumbling The receipt clearly says 6-8 weeks. I'm out $300 (cost of the repair and the difference for a comparable replacement) for a belt they lost.

Do yourself a favor, and go to another Gucci store.<//review>< Pictures>

So bad here, If you purchased one thing you have to take it, even there is a damage I’ve to the two of the Gucci places 1st is Glendale Gucci and the second one was here, they’re both told me I can not return, but the 1st reason is they are different systems so they can not take it, but today I’m so angry with it, I’ve been running for this two days, the second store told me I have to go to the original store to return it,but they close at 6pm ??? What the hell, I don’t think they have customer service after you purchase the item. That’s how they treat me, now I’m going to take it. But I wouldn’t buy any of the Gucci.<//review>

< Review>
It was a meh experience there, maybe because it's located in a meh shopping center. I wasn't inspired to buy anything and it seems that their designs aren't universally appealing anymore ..<//Review>

I placed an order by phone with sales rep Yeri. She wasn't very helpful or very attentive. I understand that I placed a phone order, but since I placed my order,  i can't even get the store on the phone. It simply rings and rings. Worst Gucci experience that i have ever had. I even tried calling and texting Yeri with no success.  Gucci needs more checks and balance because stores like Gucci Beverly ruin the Gucci brand.</text>

the problem isn't with gucci it's with the workers at this particular location. (Beverly center) I walked in and all of them were standing there just starting at me I thought maybe they would at least say hi but no it was uncomofortable. I was wearing normal clothes(no designer) You don't have to dress up to be able to afford designer items. It was funny because an older lady wearing Hermes bag walked in after me and they all greeted her. I asked the Asian girl a question and she ignored me and went to the lady and asked if she can help her find anything lol it was hilarious but after I purchased what I was looking for their behavior changed and they became very friendly and started kissing my ass lol STRANGE.<//text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Well since my italian diamonds make fake goods do not ask for a machine it was blacks crying to millenniums.
Well my Italian diamond produces counterfeit goods as it does not ask for a machine crying for many years.
حسنا, بما أن الماس الإيطالي يصنع سلعا مزيفة, فلا يسأل عن آلة كان يبكي فيها السود إلى آلاف السنين.
음, 내 이탈리아 다기 다기 않았기 천년기 까지 우는 흑인 이었습니다.
ٹھیک ہے جب میری اطالوی ہیرے کو جعلی سامان بنا دیتا ہے تو ایک مشین پوچھنا ہوتا ہیر یہینیمیوینی روی تتی.
Although my Italian gems make fake items do not demand a machine that it blacks out for thousands of years.
好吧, 因为 我 的 意大利 钻石 制造 假货 不 要求 机器, 它 是 黑人 哭 到 千年
له دې امله چې زما د ایټالیا هیرے جعلي توکي جوړوي د ماشین غوښتنه کوي, دا تورونه چې د زرګونو زرو سره روانې وې.
حسنا, بما أن الماس الإيطالي يصنع سلعا مزيفة, فلا يسأل عن آلة كان يبكي فيها السود إلى آلاف السنين.

(Original)
Well since my italian diamonds make fake goods dont ask for a machine it was blacks crying to millenniums.
ওয়েল থেকে আমার ইতালিয়ান হীরা জাল পণ্য তৈরি করে যেহেতু এটি বহু বছর ধরে কালো কাঁদছে এমন একটি মেশিনের জন্য জিজ্ঞাসা করে না।
حسنًا ، بما أن الماس الإيطالي يصنع سلعًا مزيفة ، فلا يسأل عن آلة كان يبكي فيها السود إلى آلاف السنين.
음, 내 이탈리아 다이아몬드가 가짜 제품을 만들 때 기계를 요구하지 않았기 때문에 천년기까지 우는 흑인이었습니다.
ٹھیک ہے جب میری اطالوی ہیرے کو جعلی سامان بنا دیتا ہے تو ایک مشین سے پوچھنا ہوتا ہے کہ یہ زینتیموں سے رو رہی تھی.
ਭਾਂਵੇਂ ਕਿ ਮੇਰਾ ਇਟਾਲੀਅਨ ਹੀਰੇ ਜਾਅਲੀ ਵਸਤਾਂ ਬਣਾਉਂਦੇ ਹਨ ਇੱਕ ਮਸ਼ੀਨ ਦੀ ਮੰਗ ਨਹੀਂ ਕਰਦੇ ਕਿ ਇਹ ਕਾਲੀਆਂ ਹਜ਼ਾਰਾਂ ਸਾਲਾਂ ਤੱਕ ਪੁਕਾਰਦਾ ਸੀ.
好吧，因为我的意大利钻石制造假货不要求机器，它是黑人哭到千年。
له دې امله چې زما د ایټالیا هیرے جعلي توکي جوړوي د ماشین غوښتنه کوي، دا تورونه چې د زرګونو زرو سره روانې وې.
حسنًا ، بما أن الماس الإيطالي يصنع سلعًا مزيفة ، فلا يسأل عن آلة كان يبكي فيها السود إلى آلاف السنين.</review>< user_id>

This is the only store with a working fax machine that accepts Google drive. I go here often to print stuff and didn't have much issue with the machines. The employees, when I do need their assistance, are friendly and are always nearby when you need their help. The store is beautiful and the parking is plentiful. Great store.</Review>

Return service is fast and in time so adding 2 stars. Overall after sales service is good. I do hope the chair quality can be a bit better..

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spent $400 on a chair that cannot assemble together....  I used the right components and worked on it for 2 hours yesterday. It turns out the bolts they provided are too short (suppose to be 1 - 1/4).  Option is to contact the original manufacturer to get the right bolts. Or spend another $400 to get a new chair and return the old one.  Quite disappointed about this issue and the time waste...< /Review>

I'm always blown away by how the team goes above and beyond to help the clients and even offer events for us to bring our families/friends to. This location was recently remodeled to the top standards with 2 conference room, lockers, a large kitchen, waiting area, and telephone booths. The team is a pleasure to work with and constantly taking in recommendations for any improvements to be made. I've been able to grow by business much faster by working here than at home. The offer offices, permanent desk, and even open desk spaces. If you need a place to get some work done, you need to check them out!</Review>< Rate>

Decent selection of products and had everything I needed except for paper rolls for our credit card machine. When I asked the guy at the counter, he said they didn’t carry them. I’ve gotten them there before.</review>

This office supply store is my go to place for office supplies. They are helpful, and go out of their way to answer any questions I may have. It is quite large, they have furniture as well as any paper supplies you may think you need. Good customer service. Highly recommend.< /Review>

This is a good place to stop on your way home for a few miscellaneous items.  Selection can be limited though on even moderately less common supplies.  But, I still can't figure out why you have to walk through the furniture section to get from paper and pens to staples and paper clips.  The staff are always helpful, when you can find them.  I like the convenience, as long as they have what I need...</text>

<Review>They've reorganized the whole store to focus on electronics when you first walk in and then office supplies tucked in the back, with office space to rent up front as well. It seems like they are utilizing the space a bit better, the rows of supplies are more like a supermarket than randomly spread out like they were before. Lots of staff around to help find things.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

This place has gotten a major revamp in the last couple months. The front half now features a copy & print center, a Best Buy-style tech sales area, and tons of loungy space which (I assume) likely has wifi. The back half is a little compressed but is what you're used to -- office supplies and furniture. An interesting new feature is the Amazon-style locker that straddles both worlds, where you can pick up pre-ordered goods (from Office Depot only). Overall, a wise and welcoming overhaul. As an organization-lover, I really hope it works!< /review>

Keeps up with the standard Office Depot standards of very friendly and pretty knowledgeable staff, over-priced goods, and a little smaller selection of products. They will price-match with the most well-known online stores, which makes them a good place to go to when you need a product right now for your home or business.</Text>

Fancy. Alarming. Inefficient.
The new layout looks very upscale. A holdover from the old store is an annoying inexplicable beeping noise. The exit is now narrowed to a tiny botteneck, so I stood there staring into space while two dazed women slowly moved out of the way, as if by random Brownian motion.<//Text>

Then the stapler broke as soon as I took it out of the packaging.
So I drove back, presented the faulty merchandise and receipt - got another stapler with no additional hassle. I'm glad the staff didn't give me a hard time! Much appreciated.</Review><user_id>104338369548585861822</user_id></record></dataset><record>

I usually come here during the day, and the service is usually great. In fact that's the only reason why its not being rated a one star. My last experience here was around 8:20pm. I took into consideration that the store said it closes at 9pm. I asked right off the bat if I could print something off an email. The cashier that "helped" me asked me multiple time if I had a flash drive (to which I told her three times that no I didnt). Then after ten minutes of her talking over her headset and fiddling around with the computer, she finally told me that she cant operate her printer for the rest of the night. She then told me with a smirk that, "I need to come earlier in the day" and told me that Fedex was down the road and I can go there. No apology, or good attitude... Worst customer service I have ever received there!</Review>

<Text>Bought my new computer here and really liked the info I got and help. One snafu that almost kept me from getting my computer from them: the person helping me explained, after checking, that it was the only one left in their stores (on sale) in the area, and said he would give me $50 off if I bought the last one - which happened to be their display one. However, when I took it to the register, the person checking me out insisted that they only ever give 10% off of displays. And he was rude about it, ignoring me when I said we had been told otherwise. Meanwhile, the person who had originally told me that could not be found. It seems his shift just ended and he had left. The cashier continued to argue with me and I asked to speak to the manager. Upon nearing our register, the cashier said, "they claim they were told they would get $50 off," which rubbed me the wrong proverbial direction. However, after listening to us, the manager gave us the $50 off, and I love my computer.< /Text>< pictures>

Lack of employees to help. When I asked for a specific device they asked me for the SKU number, since I didn't have the SKU, the guy at the counter just handed me a large phone book sized catalog to find it for him instead of showing any willingness to help.<//Text>

< review>
Wonderful experience!! Everyone that helped us from check in to the doctor was so friendly and professional. We were very thankful to have this weekend option for Amber’s care!! I called another place first and was left on hold twice with no response. Thankfully, I didn’t go there and found Animal Urgent Care. We ended up waiting for a while for Amber to have surgery, so I got to see a lot of people and different animals come and go - all taken care of beautifully. Highly recommend!! Thank you to a wonderful group!!</review>

Wonderful experience at the Animal Urgent Care of South Orange County.
Our dog Clyde has lymphoma and was seen here twice in March 2021 for severe ear infections, most likely a side effect of his chemotherapy, and the wonderful veterinary doctors Cross and Ng treated him each time with exceptional compassion and professionalism.
We came here again in May when Clyde had yet another complication from his chemotherapy; this time we saw Dr. Henry, and once again we are most grateful for the high quality care and exquisite medical knowledge.
The staff here is caring, wonderful, and very efficient, and we can't be more thankful to Diane (Floor Nurse),  Jessica (Client Service Representative), Manuel (Client Service Representative), Nancy (Client Service Representative), and Amy. A special thanks to Amanda who always helps out - these guys are I truly amazing.<//Text>

I was given a long list of procedures my dog "needed" to get well. I would have preferred to be given the range of choices. I asked for the list to be prioritized. It felt like they were trying to get me to spend as much money there as possible. I didn't like that pressure. The care my dog received seemed appropriate after I chose what I thought were reasonable procedures considering her condition.< /Text>

I brought my Boxer Mona in with an ear flap bleed she got from rowdy play at daycare. It happens. The vet on duty evaluated her, decided that the wound was too small for stitches, and fitted her with a "No Flap Ear Wrap" to help her recover without flapping her ears and reopening the wound. She's doing great with it. The wound still isn't completely healed, but I check every day and give her the prescribed antibiotics. They really did a great job.</Review>

Compassionate care by Dr Henry. The whole experience was perfection from our call to the actual visit. Dr Henry was able to find the tiniest bee stinger in our pups paw. It was miniscule but gave our pup lots of pain. We are very grateful and relieved they were able to solve the problem and were well organized, professional and sincere<//Review>

Two days ago, in the middle of the night, I was awakened to the sound of my cat howling in pain. I knew something was seriously wrong and took her to Animal Urgent Care of South OC. Due to covid restrictions, I had to wait in the car during the exam. After some time, the doctor called me and gave me the absolute worst news that my cat had a serious, untreatable illness and would not make it much longer.

The doctor gave me this news in a matter of fact, yet incredibly compassionate manner. She explained all the details so I could truly understand and, most importantly, reassured me that there was nothing I could have done + my cat wasn’t currently in pain because of the pain medication they gave her. I can’t tell you what a relief that was to my aching heart. She gave me space to decide what I was going to do, but in my mind, I knew the right thing to do was to put my cat down.

The doctor asked me whether I wanted to come in and say goodbye and whether I wanted to be present for my cat’s last moments. I really appreciated that she did not make any assumptions, which made me feel incredibly supported and respected.

When I went inside to say goodbye, they brought her into the room and reassured me that I could take as long as I needed. In the moment that the final medication was administered, the doctor was gentle and kind and I truly felt that, despite the pain of the moment, I was not alone.

My sweet little Jasmine cat died, peacefully, head cradled in my hands... and I could not have been more grateful for those last moments.

Again, the doctor reassured me that I could take as long as I needed. She also reassured me that the staff would treat her body with dignity. Nobody wants to say goodbye to their beloved pet, but I’m telling you, the amount of kindness, empathy, dignity, and compassion I received made it all bearable.

But here’s the thing... the moment of passing is NOTHING compared to the grief and sadness I currently feel. So you can imagine how much it meant to come home this evening and find a card in the mailbox.... Signed by all staff with personal, individual messages of condolence. And a little card with a Jasmine’s paw print.😭It sure doesn’t take the pain away, but I’ll be damned if it didn’t make me feel a little less alone in the world.

I wish that Jasmine was still here, but my heart is at peace. I could not be more grateful for the work that they did, and for every ounce of kindness that was shown to me and to Jasmine in her final moments.

Thank you all for walking with me through one of the hardest moments of my life and thank you for taking care of Jasmine. I will forever think of you with incredible gratitude.< /Text>

<review>The service was extensive and thorough. The pricing for said services was very high. I do realize it's an EMERGENCY after hours service, but they're only open after hours. When your Dog is hurting, you'll do almost anything to make it stop, but I feel exorbitant pricing is just taking advantage. Again, the Dr. was thorough and seemed to identify the issue ( Although 2 days later some of the issues still exist). just would hope for fairer pricing, closer to a normal Vet Service.<//review></record>

I am in tears as I type this it's so fresh... We lost our beloved Stinky Cat after 18 years four days ago. We came here in a panic as our kitty was beginning to have seizures that night. Unfortunately, we lost our fur baby that night but I can't tell you how compassionate this hospital is. Dr. Cross took her time and helped us though an amazingly tough time. Today, I just opened up a sympathy card with paw prints of my Stinky and signed by the entire staff. If you're in a position where you need emergency medical care for your pet, please come here. They're worth every penny. Thank you all for your compassion, grace and assistance.</review>

Very happy with this vet ER. Last week our rabbit was showing signs of GI Stasis. As it was already after 10pm our options were not only limited to who was open but who had someone on staff that knew how to work with rabbits. We called several local locations who said they couldn’t help us. When we called here, Cindy made sure to tell us while the vet working (Dr Cross) was not a rabbit expert, she had experience with them and felt confident she could help our rabbit.
We made the drive from Corona to Mission Viejo. They were quick to take him in and gave us an initial diagnosis. We made the call to have him stay over night.
Upon returning Dr Cross told us he had improved dramatically over night and was back to being his normal rambunctious self again. We did take him to his normal vet the next day as they recommended. 4 days later and he is back to normal and his brother missed him and is happy to be reunited. Thank you to Cindy, Dr Cross, and the entire staff at Animal Urgent Care of South OC.<//Text>

Although we waited quite some time, close to 2 hours in order for the vet to give us a call after our dog’s examination, it was worth the wait. After all, there were a lot of cars in the parking lot, so I know they were busy. I felt comfortable with the vets diagnosis and her plan of treatment. I’ve come back to this same clinic for years and years... not only because it’s close to my house, but I’ve always liked the vets, as they are confident and kind. Highly recommend!< /review>

<Review>The caregivers here are so fabulous. My doggies were attacked by coyotes. I lost one but one survived the attack. We are so thankful for these nurses and doctors!! He has a chance of surviving due to their quick and knowledgeable responses.  The manager has called numerous times to see how he is. We had to transfer him to another hospital for surgery. She is still calling even though he has left. They go above and beyond. Here your precious little one isn’t just a  number but a high priority as a  family member. God bless these sweet caring souls. I will forever be grateful!! The work and care they did is amazing. Thank you staff!!! Love to all❤️</Review>< pictures>

<Text>I have unfortunately had to go to Animal Urgent Care of South OC few different times with my fur babes for emergencies that have came up over the years. They helped me  with my now 13 year old Chihuahua, ChiChi,  when she had a stroke at about 6 weeks old. They helped me when my fur babe, Honey, passed away about 5 years ago. She was ripe ol age of 14 years. And then the other night I had to bring our newest fur babe in as we thought she swallowed something she shouldn't have and her breathing was not normal. Each time they have been so kind, professional, patient and overall a good experience. The downside to after hours is the cost, which ultimately I know that is anywhere, but that would be my only negative remark is the cost factor. Or not having options for payments that does not require applying for a credit line of some sort. Other then that the people that make up this facility are amazing and makes unfortunate situations that may arise with your fur babe little easier.< /Text>< pictures>

Excellent
Service was pretty quick. Very friendly.
The diagnosis came pretty quick ( found the diarrhea was caused by a parasite). Was explained very well.
Meds were administered and sent home with us.
All took less than 2 hrs and our Puppy “Hugs” was on the road to recovery and again a Very Happy Puppy.
Thank All of you for the great Animal Care< /Text>

They did a wonderful job even during Covid. The staff was friendly. The cost and treatment plan was discussed, so i completely  understood what was going on with my fur baby . They were not pushy and let me decide how much testing I wanted to do. Results for the tests were 1/2 hour to an hour.  One of the tests did take overnight to get the results.  I received a call first thing in the morning from the doctor. My experience with Amimal Urgent Care was excellent.<//Text>

< Review>
My cat Miso swallowed a sewing needle and needed to have it surgically extracted.  Animal Urgent Care of South Orange County was the second hospital I went to after the first one confirmed the situation with an x-ray and quoted me a fee for the procedure that was I could not afford.  Dr. Cross and team at AUCSOC demonstrated much compassion and care for Miso while maintaining great communication and providing assurance for this anxious cat mama.  I was extra impressed to find out from my vet that Dr. Cross personally called them to deliver post-op instructions while I was en route with Miso in the morning after the surgery.  It demonstrated to me that she truly cares for her paw patients.  After this experience, I am comforted to know that Animal Urgent Care of South Orange County is there, though I hope not to have to need them again!</Review>

From the initial phone call to them in our emergency with our cat to taking her home, each person was calming, re-assuring, very competent, careful, and professional.

<Text>Never coming back here. I called ahead to ask if they cared for bearded dragons and they said yes. I drop her off and wait 2 hours in their parking lot only for them to call me and tell me they can't actually do any testing or help me. They wanted to charge me $160 to just give her fluids, I paid $90 for a surgery once on a bearded dragon. Far more skill required. They would not reduce their cost despite wasting my time and failing to give me the right information. I now have to find another hospital to bring my pet to tonight because these people are incompetent and have wasted my entire evening when I could of gone to another urgent care that could actually freaking help.</Text>< UserId.>

My senior cat’s personality changed within an hour and she clearly was in pain and growling at me. Took her here at 11 pm and although it took a long time (to be expected in any urgent care whether people or pets) they were great. The techs are friendly and kind and Dr. Henry very informative. I appreciate having this team around the corner for those harrowing health moments with my cat.< /review>

<Text>We had to take our new puppy to urgent care because our older/bigger dog attacked him. The redemption we got upon arriving was quick and very friendly. They took our pup inside immediately. After a few minutes they called me to get a more thorough account of what had happened. After the Dr. was able to see him they called with an update and a plan of care. Every step along the way the would call with an update and recommendation for what to do next. There was never any high pressure recommendations. They quoted us all prices up front and gave us the opportunity to choose the treatment we wanted. I bring this up because fur babies steal our hearts and it would be very easy to pay for something that maybe you could wait on. When they were done with everything the vet called, told us what care she had provided, what the plan at home would be and when to follow up with our regular vet. They gave us prescriptions for what she felt was appropriate to keep our puppy healthy and with minimal pain. This is the second time we have had to use this urgent care (different dog) with the same great experience.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1592866063789, 'text': 'Thank you for the kind review.

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I live in Murrieta, and this was the only hospital that was willing to take my baby, which also happen to be an hour away and 1:30ish in the morning at the time that my baby was attacked. At the end of the day my baby had to many damages, and not once did they pressure me in putting her down, they recommend a lot of options however they also let me know what to expect afterwards. Which was going to be a lot of pain and a lot of uncomfortable situations for her. The vet was extremely sweet and understanding , and so was everyone else. When I was at my lowest they did everything they could to tend to me and my baby. I hope no one goes through this, but if you need someone to go to, absolutely they can with your own fur baby it should be here. They also briefly go through everything that you will need to pay and before they go ahead with the next plan they let you know the cost and what’s next. That way you are updated every step of the way.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLr2NkUA7JABr7xmLfA7XyewSuZB84CcLLaWsG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1594324277942, 'text': "We are so sorry for the loss of your dear fur baby, Martha.

<text>That moment we all dread...  10PM and my 4 month old rottie puppy eats a SOCK!  I called Animal Urgent Care, and they calmed me down, and let me know it would be risky to let him try to pass it on his own.

So, I drove him on down to the team there.  He immediately took to them, they all thought he was great... I asked if they just wanted to keep him... they said no.

They were able to induce vomiting and get the sock, which they were going to give back === NOOOO THANK YOU!!   He's no worse for the wear, still wants to eat socks.

They got all this done very quickly (less than ~30 mins) while setup for and practicing social distancing.  Well Done, and THANK YOU Animal Urgent Care!!</text><response>{'time': 1599507751053, 'text': 'Hi Cathy! Thank you for the complimentary review and 5 stars.

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>It was pricey which was expected but they had no payment plan option and I didn't have $1000+ up front so I couldn't run all the tests needed for my kitten until the next day at another vet 😭 BUT they were 24 hour and extremely professional and polite and truly cared while following covid guidelines and then some! They are definitely worth going to... I didn't have the upfront money but the only reason it was such a high price is because they thought of every possible reason for her illness and systematically went through relevant testing options they were all necessary.

Took my older dog here late on a Saturday night. Did not have to enter the facility, they had everything set up outside. They took care of my dog for two nights, everyone was very professional and kept good communication. Everyone seemed to be working very hard throughout the evening while I was there.< /text>

Be aware that  this place is an emergency only facility and open after hours, so it does charge more for their services. But, in my experience it is actually insane the price difference. I was quoted $1900 for stitches. Yes, the wound was rather large but it was skin only and did not include the muscle. I had them wrap the wound and brought my dog home. I took her to my vet in the morning and was charged $550.<//review>

<Text>We took our 6 month old Boston Terrier for his morning potty. When he came back in he was acting unusual. Then my worst fear happened…his tongue was turning blue! We immediately got in the car and drove to the Urgent care. As we were driving I was obviously in a panic when I called to let them know we were on our way. The lady that answered the phone was so nice and asked me simple questions about what was going on. When we arrived they were very reassuring and kept me updated on the progress. Turns out he got stung by a bee on his foot and he was going into Anaphylactic shock. They were all so caring!< /Text>< pictures>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>The clinic staff were fantastic. Very caring and took good care of my little dog when he got attacked by raccoons. I had to leave him there overnight since they had a very busy night. Dr and staff explained the treatments necessary. My only objection is they won’t allow you in the building due to covid so if you need to use a restroom make sure to go over with empty bladder since the porter potty outside I was told was not clean. The wait is long so they should allow the use of restrooms.</Review><Time>1598219443367<//Time><pictures>None<//pictures>< user>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Over the years, we have had to bring a number of our senior rescue dogs to the Animal Urgent Care of South Orange County when they were having some emergency issues.  Most recently, we brought Chappy, our 14 1/2-year-old Westie, who we rescued in 2007.   Earlier in the evening, we noticed that he was having difficulty breathing which progressively got worse, so we got him to AUCSC.  We appreciated the friendliness compassion, and professionalism of the entire staff, particularly the candor of Dr. Laura Cross. The diagnosis of Westie lung disease (pulmonary fibrosis) and an enlarged heart was devastating to us.  The prognosis for a senior dog was not good.   If Chappy was younger, we might have attempted some of the treatment options.  We picked Chappy up around 7:30 A.M. and took him to our regular vet.  After seeing the stress he was under, we made the difficult decision to let him go.  This was the 16th time we had to walk down that road in the 46 years of our marriage.  It is never easy, but with Chappy, it was extremely hard to make, because he was such a happy dog who got along famously with many of the other rescues that we have had over the 13 years Chappy was with us

We are very thankful that the Animal Urgent Care of South Orange County is available for those emergencies that our beloved pets find themselves.  Each time we have had to bring one of our rescues to them, we have been impressed with personnel their services.  The only negative comment would be that their charges seem rather high.  What are you going to do?   You pay for it!<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvWERc48FHt3AgG1TYGEXr89w5eYM7JITVs3sI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNI8FlN8Z2G9GCRTaC0KzsADTJMWrPmRfMpIPPf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1580417645052, 'text': "We are so sorry to hear of Chappy's passing and were glad we could be there for you.

<user_name>E Smith</user_name><rating>5</rating><Review>Our senior dog suddenly stopped walking at home and would yelp in pain when we tried to carry her. She was in such severe pain, she wouldn't move from her position. It was after midnight and our regular vet office was closed, so we went to this after hours location.
The staff was very friendly, professional, and took excellent care of our dog. Since her X-ray was negative, it's likely she suffered a muscle strain after jumping off the couch and slipping on hardwood flooring. We now have a ramp and carpet around the couch.
The vet administered pain medication that night and prescribed gabapentin. After one day, our dog is walking normal and we are very happy parents! Thank you Animal Urgent Care of South Orange County!!< /Review>< Resp>

We only went here once to put our dog down, but can’t say how grateful we are to everyone.
We arrived at 4:30am and everyone was friendly and sweet during such a painful time for us. It made a big difference when making a necessary but heartbreaking decision.
The follow up card was unexpected yet so appreciated.
We miss out sweet boy but to have those final minutes go so peacefully puts our hearts at ease.</Review>

< Review>
The only reason why I didn't give them 5 stars was because of the medical bill in the end and how expensive it was, but that is to be expected when it's at 3:30am on a Sunday. I wish there were urgent cares a little cheaper for when emergencies arrive, but that's a different story.
When I first called them at around 2am with the issue going on, they were really kind and professional and they were doing all they could to help me take care of this issue from home so I could avoid the expense of bringing my kitten in. They told me what to look out for and if the situation continued then bring her in. I was really grateful for them and how considerate they were. When it did come down to me having to bring my cat in, they were very prompt in bringing her in (even with COVID-19's safety procedures putting a wrench in it all by not allowing me to go inside) and I got a phone call from a tech or the doctor herself about every 20 minutes with updates on how my kitten was doing and what they were doing. They always called with an estimate before they did something, which is another thing I was really grateful for, too. It came down to that we didn't really have an explanation for what was going on and the doctor again told me that she 1) felt the kitten was stable enough to go home so we wouldn't have to hospitalize her and 2) would give me stuff to help my kitten at home with the vomiting. Although she couldn't promise me that this situation wouldn't continue, she told me she was confident that the kitten would recover on her own, but if she didn't, to bring her back in (and she gave me a list of symptoms to watch out for again).
Very kind, considerate and professional staff. Although I pray we never have to go back because of the price (and who ever wants their pet to get sick or hurt??), I trust their staff and this animal hospital for any emergencies that may arise with my pets!<//Review>

<Review>We have a 5 month old puppy & he's like a vacuum, picking up & eating anything he see's when we go out on walks. He had the typical signs of eating something bad vomiting, lethargy etc & it obviously was not agreeing with him or obstructing his bowels.

This was the closest 24hr Urgent Care in South OC to where we live in Lake Forest. I will have to stay their procedure during the COVID situation is very good. You walk up to the front door, call that you've arrived, you fill out paper work outside, leave it on the table, everyone is face masked, they come & pick your pet up, you sit in your car or outside until they call you for results. So they get a 5 star for that.

The Vet is very thorough about going over her thoughts & opinions on what is going on with your pet & offers of course her suggestions which are NOT CHEAP! I'm used to Vet "up-selling" services to pad the price as much as possible, I get it, it's still a business, they know many are going to deny certain services so just be aware to READ over the price list of everything that WAS done & everything they want to do.

In the end it took about 3hrs & we didn't come home until midnight. This was a very expensive trip to the Vet to basically state, "He ate something off the ground & he has a tummy ache"!! Uhggggg! But how are we to know this up front & we're grateful of this type of service for at very least it can give you some reassurance that you did right by your pet.</Review>< Pics>

Took wonderful care of my Roo, our aging Malchi, and equally great care of me!  So scary when they are in distress.  There was frequent communication on her status, since due to C19 had to stay in the car.  Also, I couldn't afford all the recommended tests, so the doctor prioritized the tests for me, and offered guidance should the issue return.  PS.  So far, Roo is doing wonderfully - YAY.< /Text>

I am very impressed with Animal Urgent Care of South Orange County. I rushed my dog in after she had a seizure late in the evening. I was a complete mess and the staff was very warm and friendly. I had a short wait, as it is first come first serve but they took my dog back so they could observe her until there was an available vet. The lobby was very clean and comforting with lots of snacks, drinks, comfortable seating and it was decorated for Christmas. The doctor I spoke with was incredible intelligent, well educated and I was very grateful to have such a passionate vet to examine my pet. Everyone was just amazing, it was the best experience I could have had given the circumstances.

I am sure and hope it is case by case, but the first come, first serve method was a little distressing for me. I offered for several other people to go ahead of me, as my dog was in a fine state and just needed to be observed at this point but they said they operate 'first come, first serve". So hopefully if an animal is in more medical need, they will assist accordingly.<//text>

I took my Golden Retriever into the hospital around midnight after she ate 10 pounds of another dog’s kibble. I talked to the staff and to the veterinarian that was on duty to let them know that I have no income at the moment, and I’m homeless. They took that into consideration and went with the least expensive route that they could and still make her OK. Instead of keeping her overnight with IV liquids which would’ve been very expensive, they put some fluids under her skin and let me park my van in their parking lot over night so we could be close in case she needed to come back. Everyone we dealt with there was compassionate and competent. I would definitely recommend them,and I would definitely go there again if I needed to.< /review>

I live in Murrieta, and this was the only hospital that was willing to take my baby, which also happen to be an hour away and 1:30ish in the morning at the time that my baby was attacked. At the end of the day my baby had to many damages, and not once did they pressure me in putting her down, they recommend a lot of options however they also let me know what to expect afterwards. Which was going to be a lot of pain and a lot of uncomfortable situations for her. The vet was extremely sweet and understanding , and so was everyone else. When I was at my lowest they did everything they could to tend to me and my baby. I hope no one goes through this, but if you need someone to go to, absolutely they can with your own fur baby it should be here. They also briefly go through everything that you will need to pay and before they go ahead with the next plan they let you know the cost and what’s next. That way you are updated every step of the way.<//Text>

Thank you for taking care of our Shirley!  My dog had a seizure and we took her here at 4AM on Christmas Day.  As soon as we walked in the door, they took her right away and worked on calming her seizure down.  They allowed us to visit her several times while she stayed under their care for 24-hours.  We are so fortunate that she was cared for by people who truly love animals. From the front desk, the vet technicians and nurses and the doctors - we only experienced care and compassion.  We cannot thank you enough for saving our Shirley.< /review>

My dog was stung by a bee and had a very severe reaction.  Dr. Ng and her staff took care of everything right away.  Though I had to leave my sweet frenchie overnight, I knew she was in good hands, and the staff encourages you to call at any time for a status update.  The pricing is transparent, the care is exemplary, and all of the staff members I encountered were incredibly kind and pleasant.  I'm very grateful for the service and compassionate care that helped get my dog back to her spunky self!< /Text>

We went there on 4th of July due to my puppy got injured on right rear leg. After 4hrs wait for nothing finally got a chance to let doctor to see her. Wait for another hour to do X-rays for diagnosing. We got the answer from Dr. saying my dog DOSEN’T have any fracture or broken bone. Only injured on soft tissues so diagnosed as “sprain”!
Paid about $620 for the X-rays, exam fee and take home medications.
On Monday July 6th, my puppy still limping very bad and her position is odd. I took her to our regular vet clinic, done X-rays again and diagnosed FRACTURE. Today July 9th my puppy ended up having surgery and needs pins to fix the fracture.
I’m very very upset about the doctor couldn’t even exam right or order the right X-ray to read it. My puppy was bed rest from 4th to 6th, fracture must happened on the injury day. Where my $620 goes? My puppy is injured not internal medical issues I believe fracture is the easiest thing to diagnosed right?< /text>

We rushed our beloved silver lab to the clinic late on a Saturday night.  They took him immediately, incubated him and saved his life!  They cared for him with the best vet ICU care, and stabilized him for us to take him home there next morning.  The front desk attendant was there both the night we went in and when I returned the next morning, both he and the woman who came in for the night shift were very reassuring. We are grateful to all of the staff there, especially Dr. Henry!<//Text>

We had doctor Henry and she barely checked my dog's eye and didn't even put a light or anything to check her before diagnosing her. The facility just adds up a bunch of different tests to hike up their bill and send you home with meds. I would not take my pet there anymore :(<//text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

The only problem I had was when the vet came in to talk to me it seemed like he care more about making the hospital money than actually caring about my dog. And not to mention they don’t give price breaks for multiple things like most others do. If you can avoid going there I would.<//review>

Dr. Henry and staff were fantastic with our 11 yr old Greyhound. They were caring and made us feel safe in a frightening situation. Our dog had a bad reaction to pain meds and was bleeding but they were able to help us through the night until we could get her to her vet in the morning. All is well and our sweetie is back to her old self. Thank you for being there for all of us fur parents!< /Review>

I’m glad the clinic is open when our vet is closed. Only comment is they gave us pain meds and the information sheet said do not give to dogs with kidney problems. Our dog has one functioning kidney at a rate of 30%. We could have called, but as she didn’t seem in pain and the bottle said as necessary, we did not use the meds. Maybe they knew the meds were ok, but would have liked an explanation. So I will read all paperwork prior to leaving- hopefully not anytime soon!

Our experience was great!  Our 3 month old puppy, Minnie,  got stung by a bee and immediately started throwing up and her whole body went limp.  I took her right away to AUCSOC.  They tended to her quickly and kept me informed at every step along the way. They were very professional and caring throughout the entire visit.  We left about 45 minutes after we got there, with our puppy on the road to recovery.< /review>

<Review>I thought that the care was excellent. The doctors communicated clearly and gently about my pet's situation. The staff was gentle and loving to my cat. After initially being afraid of the situation he relaxed and was a very cooperative patient. The staff clearly had won him over. I appreciated being able to call at any time of the day or night for a status update. The doctors called with updates as well.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

A xray and putting my baby down was 2,800.00 upfront and they deduct what they do from that. My total was 2,200.00. The vet kept dragging on and I kept saying can she be saved ?and she kept saying I'm getting to that, I dont care how or why I just wanted her saved and I wish she would have just gotten to the point instead of dragging it on.</review>< rating>

<Review>My 10 yr old Yorkie was very lethargic and was in pain.  I took him to Animal Urgent Care where he was examined quickly and tests were done with a definitive diagnosis of pancreatitis.  He was treated very well and Dr. Cruz was very kind in her explanations to me and discussion of his blood test results.  I am very pleased with their care of my Yorkie and consideration of me.  It was a 3 hour wait for me and they even provided free bottled water and a wide variety of snack options to make the wait more tolerable.</Review><response>None</response>< Time>

The doctors and staff are professional, caring and compassionate. As stressful as emergency vet visits are, they remain calm and reassuring, and are patient, taking time to answer all our questions. My Teddy was in pain from a soft tissue injury, and they examined her carefully and with affection. our Teddy is feeling much better, thank you!!< /review>

<rating>1</rating><Text>I took my dog in because I thought he was having a stroke. It ended up that he had eaten marijuana. When Dr. Henry asked if there was marijuana in the house I told her no but from that point forward she was rude and condescending. I did not appreciate her attitude at all when I tried to explain that one of the neighbors actually owned a marijuana dispensary and it was highly possible they had thrown something over the fence. At one point, she smirked at me and said, “that’s what everyone says”.  To be treated as a criminal was rude, unprofessional, and I will try my hardest to never go to for anything again. The rest of the staff was professional at the least.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Friendly service. Loved that they gave me options for treating my dog rather than dumping a ton of charges on me. They walked me through each option and the costs.

The staff was very prompt, but I waited a while for the vet to come in, and it didn’t seem like there were any other customers there. Some communication about the wait would’ve been helpful. Overall though it was a good experience and I’m happy to have this place next time I need after hours vet care.< /Review>

<Review>Edit: I would like to clarify, I was never offered to leave her there overnight, or to give her oxygen. Not really sure why the vet would say in her report that I was offered but declined.... it never, ever came up.

They ONLY see dogs and cats here, no matter that they tell you in the phone.

I called ahead to see if they could treat a rat. The guy said yes, so at like 9pm I brought her in. While the rest of the staff was incredibly friendly, the vet herself was not. After they took my rat back to take her vitals and whatnot, the vet came into the exam room where I was waiting and went on (in a very condescending tone) about how she doesn’t treat rats and knows nothing about rats, rolled her eyes at me at once point when I mentioned that my rats came from a breeder, kept asking why I didn’t take her to a vet (it was 9pm), and then gave me an inconclusive diagnosis (“idk that’s the extent of my knowledge about rats”) and antibiotics. $160 later (for what?? To be told she knows nothing about rats?? I should not have been charged) they give her back to me but now she’s making this awful sound she wasn’t making before, she’s acting terrified of being handled (she usually loves being picked up), and is side-sucking (a sign of an internal injury). I don’t know what they did to her but I’m putting my money on “knew nothing about rats and manhandled her”..... do NOT take your small pets here unless you want to bring them home with more wrong with them than there was to start with. I should have saved that money and gone to a REAL vet on Monday (which now I have to do anyway, because she’s so messed up now....).</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

We are actually the only overnight facility in south Orange County that sees exotics on an emergent basis.  Other facilities will not see any other patients besides dogs and cats.  Although we are not specialists, we will do everything we can to provide supportive care to your pet until you can transfer to your regular veterinarian.  We offered to treat and observe your pet overnight (preferably on oxygen since she was having respiratory compromise).  This was declined so we gave her some fluids, antibiotics and sent her home with you.  We sincerely hope that she recovers fully very soon. If you wish to contact me to discuss further, please feel free to do so.  Thanks so much,  Marina Songer RVT, LVT Hospital Administrator"}< /resp>

No one wants to end up at the animal urgent care but if you have to....this is the place to go.  They cared about our dog, they noticed my  children were hurting, and they handled the situation with kindness.  When we had to return to put him down, the kindness continued.  I can't speak highly enough about this facility.<//text>

And I've never have had a bad experience from reception, to the techs, to the doctors. No matter who I've seen they have always put my mind at ease that my pet is getting the best care and is as comfortable as possible.

<Time>1574834557330</Time><Rating>5< /Rating><review>When our bunny was in need of urgent care after already being at her normal vet earlier that day (for a different issue), the entire AUCSOC team that we interacted with late on a Friday night was incredibly helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly, from us calling beforehand all the way through checking out. They made us feel very comfortable with how they were taking care of our rabbit, and luckily the solution to our rabbit's particular problem was fairly quick and simple! The facilities were clean and service was very prompt (at 9pm, we were the only ones there). We felt the entire team really cared about our bunny's health and had her best interests in mind, but they also listened to our concerns and addressed them with the expertise that sometimes is missed by vets not familiar with exotic pets such as a rabbit.
Each step in the process was clear and well-explained and they clarified the exam fee before going there in person, so there were no surprises!
They even contacted our regular vet afterwards without us asking.
We won't hesitate to bring our bunnies here again in an after-hours emergency!< /review>< Pics>

<review>Even though I was not sure that the fine Mr Juji swallowed that pill, the staff at the hospital took him back immediately and started treatment.  I appreciate that not only were they kind to him, Tina the Tech let me tell her a few stories of my clouder, and they told me that they found my boy very handsome (well, he is)!
I appreciate that they were very up-front about the charges as well.  As with any ER visit, it was pricey, but the the care and concern they showed was worth it.  Julius is doing fine, he's no longer mad at me either.  Thank you!</review>< rating>

I called ahead to make sure they could see my chinchilla in the middle of the night and they said they could, after trying 3 other places in the OC that night and all of them not having an exotic vet on hand it was such a relief and we drove right over. Ever since person I spoke with was so kind and patient. I really felt like the staff especially the tech who worked with me heard and made sure they understood every detail and question i had for them. They didnt just take my animal and say what they could do, the spoke to me, gave me options, let me choose and readily talked to me about pricing and even offered some free services (which btw prices were way lower than I expected, I paid 400 less than what I had for the same procedure at another emergency). After we decided they took my chinchilla and provided service right away. Multiple times I was welcomed to their complimentary snack and beverage bar and although I was too worried about me guy to indulge, they had a beautiful fish tank I watched and it helped calm me down. My pet came out well and they even took extra time to put a little be mine heart bandage on his cast! It was so sweet and really made my night. Thank you to the whole team for being amazing!< /Review>< pics>

We had to take our cat in tonight as she was growling and not acting like herself. From the moment we stepped in until the moment we left we were treated with care and compassion. Everything was explained in detail and her care was top notch. If you find yourself with an animal emergency off hours I would not hesitate to bring your pet here.< /review>

Decent treatment planning — horrible follow through and unable to communicate well with customers. Really irritated that after 2 hours of my time and them poking and prodding my cat — they forgot to give him medication that they were sending me home with DESPITE telling me they actually administered when we were discharged. They called to tell me 1 hour later that they didn’t actually give it to him (forgot essentially) and that I should administer it myself. So unprofessional and unethical. Specially since after I arrived home my cat went into hiding and would not come out for me to even administer his PAIN medication. Now my poor baby is still in pain and stuck under the bed traumatized. Awesome. Thanks guys. 450$ later and you still didn’t even treat him just ran a bunch of unnecessary tests. I’m so angry. One star for being open day before Xmas eve.<//text>

<Review>I have been visiting my daughter and had to take my dog to urgent care. From the minute I walked through the door I was greeted with a friendly smiling face willing to help. When the vet came in he was wonderful very friendly Pleasant and very professional. He expressed his concern and I could tell he cared about how we for concerned for our dog. It was a wonderful experience and very pleasant. I definitely recommend this Animal Urgent Care a hundred percent.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>This is my experience dealing with Animal Urgent Care of South Orange County. Medical Negligence. Read the bottom to know your rights when your vet is medically negligent and harms your pet.

11/21: Our dog Tyson went in for blockage and GI surgery because he was throwing up his food and water - he needed immediate surgery. He had received several x-rays of both his chest and stomach and an ultrasound at his regular vets which confirmed the same. His chest was completely normal, no signs of irregularity or cancer. He never had signs of any chest issues. We were specifically dealing with stomach problems. Dr. Henry performed the surgery that night. She called us at 5am the next morning to let us know Tyson was awake. We arrived at the urgent care as soon as it opened to pick Tyson up and take him to his regular vet for follow up treatment. We waited in the waiting room as all the other animals were getting picked up. We also saw a dog rushed in that was attacked by a coyote. But still, we waited over an hour. The ladies at the front desk told us the doctor needed to speak with us directly. We had a bad feeling about it. We went into one of the rooms where we were met by Dr. Henry. She told us his surgery went well, his heart rate is normal, he did give them a struggle with the anesthesia, but other than that it went well. She handed us the ziplock bag of the blockage material Tyson had eaten. She told us they took biopsies and she did notice that Tyson had inflamed intestines (which was also indicated by our vet through X-ray, bariome radiography, and ultrasound prior to coming to urgent care). And then came the real kicker; At the end of his surgery when someone removed the tube that was going down into his stomach, they "forgot to suction out the brown GI fluid" before pulling it out, which slid back into his body, while under anesthesia, and right into his lungs. She made it seem like it wasn't a big deal. Then, when we saw Tyson, we could hear the cackling noises as he struggled to breathe. He coughed the entire car ride to his vet for post-op treatment.
(See photos for full story)

Tyson is continuing to throw up because he needs the prednisone to treat the inflamed intestines, but the prednisone will worsen the pneumonia. The pneumonia has prevented Tyson from receiving the care he actually needs. This is directly the fault of Animal Urgent Care of South Orange County.

All pet owners have rights. Please be aware of them. Martinez v. Robledo (2012) held that when a veterinary hospital is medically negligent, the owner can recover the reasonable cost of care endured as a result of that negligence. Pets are not valuable on their own except to their owners, and are therefor entitled not only to the value of their pet, but also to the costs endured. Tyson is our fur baby, a part of our family, and has had to endure suffering for more than two weeks because of their negligence. This urgent care isn't taking responsibility for their actions. Be careful if you decide to come here.

Edit: Tyson passed away 3 weeks ago as a result of this negligence. The manager has responded to us through yelp. I haven’t had the strength to face his loss, let alone respond to her. I will be sending her a package with all of his medical bills for his post op care relating to their negligence with the hopes they will do the right thing. This Christmas has been difficult, and has felt empty without him. Tyson was my world. Some people have kids, I had Tyson.< /text>< userid>

<Review>Last weekend my 14 year old golden retriever was throwing up and wouldn't hold down food. It occurred out of the blue and my Molly always loves food so I was worried. I took her in and Dr. June Crook Mason took over her care for the night, hydrating her through an IV and giving her some tests to try and find what was wrong. Even though the tests were mostly normal they were needed to rule some things out. I picked up my girl the next morning and worked on keeping her hydrated and fed her a bland diet 5x per day to allow the GI tract to heal or "reset" itself. 4 days later I noticed my tired weak dog was back to her old self, alert and much energy. I thank Dr. Crook so much for the care she took of Molly and of me when we talked about a plan. She was empathetic to me and answered all of my questions. She didn't rush me off. Yes it's expensive, but when you have urgent needs for your furry babies you want the best. The nurse team and even reception team were highly educated and it showed. One week later my Molly is doing well! Thank you so much!< /Review>< pics>

I had a really great experience. I rushed my bunny here when she had a fall which ended up breaking her tooth. Even though they don’t specialize in smaller animals like bunnies, (mainly dogs and cats) she still was taken care of and given antibiotics. She’s all better now :) Highly recommend this place.</text>

Dr. Henry saw him, did blood work & took Xrays, and narrowed down possible causes. She was very knowledgable & was great at explaining the issues so we could understand. She worked with us to find practical options & medicine we could actually get into our litle guy. Our dog went home with us to rest comfortably, pain free. We followed up with our usual vet, but we had all the info Dr Henry gave us which made diagnosis & treatment decisions so much clearer. I would definately use Animal Urgent Care of South Orange County again. Dr Henry was an excellent vet & the office staff was very nice & caring. The only other thing I would offer is that in the future if our pet needs special testing like ultra sound, I might take him to an emergency hospital that has that capability.< /Text>< Pictures>

So grateful that this place was available when our little four-legged family members needed them to help us let them go.  We just had to let go of our Izzy this past week while out of town and they were wonderful with us and our son who was with Izzy at the end. We could not ask for better care for her and us at this terrible time for us.  They were there for us 15 years ago for our Sneakers and we got the same great care this time for Izzy. Awesome place!< /review>

READ THIS----IT IS UNREAL!!!! On New Years Day, we took our dog in for a rash. It looked mean and angry, dark red with some blood from scratching. Unlike most Vets, this place did not let us go back when they took her for vitals. They brought her back and said she had a fever. We had to wait for at least a half hour or more to have her taken back again. Then we waited another half hour before we were brought into a room to discuss with the doctor...a rude-ish vet named Dr. Henry. She told us the rash was the least of our worries. Our dog, we were told, had a very high fever of 105--normal is 102.5. She needed treatment, a blood work-up, and--yep, the dropped the C-Bomb.."she may even have cancer."  Never mind about the terrible rash---that never came up again. We told them we were not in a financial place to do hundreds of dollars of treatment and we wanted to know the extent of care they were recommending. SO again we waited---20 more minutes when another assistant came in with the treatment plan...HOSPITALIZATION, overnight care, fluids, blood tests, totaling $3500.00 +!!!!!! ( We had a blood test done just 2 weeks prior at a regular appt.) We were blown away, especially since we told them we could not afford hundreds of dollars, so they bring us a THOUSANDS of dollars workup. My husband was furious...still no words on what we brought her in for, a rash. He told the assistant we just wanted our dog back, and we looked up how to take her own temp at home. Then the assistant started lowering the price, eventually down to fluids only for a few hundred dollars. We still said no, we just wanted our dog back. We paid the 88.00 for the office visit and left. We took her temp at home, 101.9....NORMAL. We told Urgent care she was eating, drinking , playing, chasing our cats, no vomiting or diarrhea....they then AGAIN, brought up the C-word..."well it could be cancer in the early stages."   DO NOT BRING YOUR PET HERE! THEY PLAY ON THE FEARS AND LOVE YOU HAVE FOR YOUR PET!!!!  My poor dog would have been away from us over night, and scared- all so they could make thousands of dollars off of scared families. To bring a dog in for a hot spot--and hear she may have cancer is beyond the realm of ridiculous and unethical!!!! And then to suggest hospitalization for a fever---unreal!!! We never got to see her temp there for ourselves, saying they don't allow that. I saw them doing the same to other nervous families  the whole time we were there, presenting huge bills to crying people who feel they have no other option to save their beloved pet. The entire time the assistant went over the enormous bill, we never saw the rude Dr. Henry again!   WE TOOK OUR DOG IN TWO DAYS LATER TO ANOTHER VET---TEMP WAS A PERFECT 102.5. Her hot spot was healed with cortisone spray!</review>

<Review>We took our dog Yogi here after he suffered a serious seizure that left my husband and I very worried.  We were seen quickly on what was very obviously a very busy holiday.  All the staff were extremely courteous and helpful, not to mention how well organized the facility is.

A special thank you to Dr Kogan for his patience and expertise in helping us with a lot of very difficult questions.

Yogi is now on the proper meds and very hopefully on the mend.</Review><userid>117784932767463526914< /userid><Rate>5< /Rate><Pics>None< /Pics>< GmapID>

We’ve visited Animal Urgent Care twice in two years with our Weimaraner, Clover. She’s an old girl and had aspirated pneumonia the first time. They worked with her all night and literally saved her life. Unfortunately we had to visit again a few nights ago and they did the same thing. I’m not giving 5 stars just because she lived, they really do have very kind and compassionate staff and reassured us of their passion for taking the best care of Clover as possible. The facility is very clean as well.</Text>

<Review>They over dosed my hamster and gave us the wrong size syringe to feed her the wrong dose. twice a day for two days she got .7ml not .07ml She went from diarrhea to constipated and then dead. We stopped giving her the medication after discovering that we where given the wrong tool, told the wrong dose and shown how to give the wrong dose but by then she had like 40 times more meds in her than she should have had. I feel like had I not gone there my hamster would still be alive. I paid $187 for the exam, tooth trim and meds. I feel like I paid them almost $200 to kill my friend and all I can do is write a bad review.  They called and left a voicemail apologizing but thats not gonna bring my buddy or my money back.< /Review>< pictures>

My dog was throwing up and bleeding from the rear and I felt like she needed to be seen immediately but waited patiently.  By the time she was seen, she was severely dehydrated and needed to stay overnight with an IV.  It seems like a dog who is showing major symptoms should be seen right away.< /Review>

<review>The Staff, hospital and fees were all very courteous and reasonable during our emergency visit when my two dogs fought and needed emergency surgeries.  It was a very traumatic time for us and it was great to know my "babies" were in such good hands.  In this time of my personal disaster, it was nice to have professional, calm people helping me.  I am so grateful that you are here to help the people and pets of South Orange County and only wish we had a "human" 24 hour care who was similar to your expertise and affordability.

Everything was up front and told in advance of what the charges would be; not like going to the ER at our local San Clemente Hospital.  They see you for a few minutes and send - not one but several - shockingly outrageous overcharged bills later.  You were very detailed on your fees and gave options for services performed.

This is an extremely well performing company with a highly trained Staff who truly care about the people and pets that they serve.  It's nice to see when a business is run as it should; and we are lucky to have this Animal Urgent Care facility available.  Thank you to one and all who helped my girls; Lexy and Gypsy that night.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart!</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dcee896354092b:0x1569bc95125a2425< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Out beloved Westin/Maltese had an Acute Pancreatitis attack, had I not brought her in late Saturday night, she may have come septic and died. This is our 3rd visit to Animal Urgent Care of South County each visit has always had the highest level of care and service; however, this visit I have mixed emotions......Perhaps what is most upsetting is whatever tech shaved the backend of our dog left left it “bright red from shaving to close” I have a photo,  it’s very upsetting. I also felt the main Vet Doctor when explaining options for my dog’s level of care was a bit “hard to follow” and seemed rushed. Lastly, we never received a follow up call to check on Claire, after she ended up spending 24 hours in the hospital. In the past, we have always had a call to see how she was doing. In all, I am still very grateful we have a urgent clinic here in south OC for these unexpected pet emergencies.< /review>

<Text>We came in at 2 in the morning to get our dog treated for an allergic reaction. The whole staff was friendly and ready to help. They treated my pup and she was good to go. Plus it was pretty cheap for an emergency visit! (depends on the procedure of course but still) Loved the visit even though it was stressful to have to do it in general.:)<//Text>< Date>

I still regret that I wasn’t with my 17-year old cat when she was put to sleep because this place wanted to charge me an extra fee (which I couldn’t afford at the time). Using pets as guinea pigs for their students is more important than an animal being with its loved ones during its final breath. I will never forgive them or myself.<//text>

<review>My dog woke me up in the middle of the night in hives.  I took him to Animal Urgent Care right away.  I walked in the door and didn't even have to sit down and wait, was immediately brought into an exam room.  The vet tech came in within minutes and the vet was in in under 5 minutes.

My dog was very scared and not too thrilled to have people looking at and touching him, but the vet was very kind and knew how to make my dog feel more comfortable and that she was someone he could trust.

He ended up getting a shot of a steroid to help the hives and bring down the swelling.  I was told to wait for 30-45 minutes to see how the shot worked.  After 45 minutes my dog still had a few hives and some swelling so they offered me a few options.  I could either go home and leave my dog for observation, stay an hour longer to see if he got better, or take more of the steroid and go home.  I mentioned that if possible I didn't want to pay more than needed, so they ended up giving more of the steroid for no additional charge.  We went home and the next morning my dog was as good as new.

I really appreciate the rapid service and compassion by all the staff.  It puts me at ease knowing we have a ER vet so close to us in times of need.  Pets are family and deserve the best!<//review>< pics>

<text>I had a 5 star experience this time but a 1 star experience 3 years ago.
Two days ago my large parrot climbed onto my little parrots cage and bit his leg through the bars, causing a fracture. The vets here stopped the bleeding and stabilized him so that he could go to a specialist in the morning. He went to the specialist and got X rays and his bone set and is doing extremely well

Three years ago I presented a bird who was in respiratory distress. The vet held the bird and the bird died within just a few seconds of the vet holding the bird. I wouldn’t have been upset if they just let us go but they tried to charge us $75 over just holding the bird, nothing was done at all.

I had one good experience and one bad experience.<//text><userid>111627932390504686626</userid>< rating>

<text>I accidentally stomped on my puppy Panzer's foot and was sure it was broken. There was almost no wait time at the facility. I was given clear and accurate options and estimates of the cost of each option. The estimates were accurate, and I was able to get the issue resolved immediately. Dr. Laura  put the x-rays up on the screen, patiently  gave me a clear and professional assessment in layman's language of Panzer's condition while doing so emphatically. Dr. Laura is the best.

Although emergency pet services are pricey, it is worth the money when you have an emergency and need an expert. I would recommend this facility and Dr. Laura without reservation.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Name>Kirby Dean<//Name><Time>1383257934369<//Time><Rating>5</Rating><Text>We brought our dog Miles here after we noticed he was having difficulty breathing.  When we arrived someone came to help carry him into an exam room (at this time he could/would not walk).  All the staff were very kind as we waited for Dr Laura Cross to come out.  When she did, we could sense and see her tenderness and concern on her face.  She did not have good news for Miles and for us.  Her compassion was heartfelt by us.  We had thought Miles was having trouble with his Addison Disease, however it was much worse. We never thought we wouldn't bring him home with us.  Dr Cross was kind and gracious as was all the staff that evening.  We are so thankful that we brought Miles there and not somewhere else.  We feel he received the best care possible.  Veterinarians have wonderful jobs helping animals - however sometimes their job can very tough.  This night was tough for Dr. Cross (emotionally) and it was obvious.  We thank her for all she did and all she gave to Miles in his short stay there.  Thank you and God Bless you all.</Text>< pics>

This facility does not offer overnight treatment. Our cat needed to be hospitalized and monitored and they said they would hospitalize him, but we would have had to awkwardly physically remove him from the hospital while they are closed and bring him back when they are open. Why would I do that? I took him to a 24 hour animal ER instead. Our veterinarian was Dr. Shannon Henry and she was curt and gruff; I did not love her but she's probably really smart.<//text>

We volunteer for a dog rescue called Coastal German Shepherd Rescue.  We are puppy fosters and one night at about 10pm one of the puppies was in real pain.  Took him down to this place and they were GREAT.

Each step of the way kept us informed and the price ended up being less then the rescues normal vets during regular hours.

We will bring our own personal dogs here if there are ever issues

Thank you for helping us!< /Review>

<review>My "rescue kitty" has a serious recurring problem which can cause his death if not treated immediately. On two occasions we were grateful for the Urgent Care center's availability and expertise during the wee dark hours of a weekend.

We would be lost without the caring and knowledgeable staff who relieved his emergency condition, sustained his fluid balance, monitored and maintained him until we could get kitty to his vet and surgery early Monday morning.< /review>< name>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Our Maltese 3 year old dog ate an Aleve pill (VERY TOXIC and usually LETHAL) and after finding out, we rushed her to the Animal Urgent Care of South Orange County.  We were immediately put in a room and spoke with a vet within minutes.

Our dog had to be admitted for blood tests, 24/7 IV fluids and constant monitoring.  The staff explained everything to us and showed us the costs up front (thank you!).

Although they were positive she could be saved, they were honest that it would be a long road of hospitalization and tests.

When I think of Animal Urgent Care of South Orange County, I think of one word.  COMPASSION.  They CARED about my dog.  They CARED about our feelings and about keeping the costs reasonable.

I would HIGHLY recommend the Animal Urgent Care of South Orange County.

A BIG Thank You to the entire staff for saving our dog, Cookie.  She is now as healthy and mischievous as ever.  :)< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>After my girlfriend picked up a puppy out of the street that had been hit by a car and likely had a broken leg or pelvis, MV animal control asked us to take the dog here. When we dropped the dog off we left a phone number and asked them to please contact us if the owners were not found as we would gladly pay for any surgery that was needed.

Several days later I saw the puppy on the lost and found website. A couple days after that it was removed. I hoped that meant they had found the owners. Well I found out from a friend that worked at a different animal hospital that they took the dog to my friends hospital and had the puppy put to sleep. Outraged I emailed them and got a response that "it would have cost thousands to fix his broken leg". To which I replied that I said I would have GLADLY paid that and that my girlfriend who also works at an animal hospital could have had the leg amputated- worst case scenario- for less than one thousand dollars.

Do NOT take any animal here if you want to be sure it isn't killed. I am appalled at this place and hope people hear my outrage and avoid them at all costs. I have never been so infuriated and disgusted with a bunch of people who "care about animals" so much in my life. Wish I could give them negative stars, Please stay away from this place.< /Review>< Pics>

Great staff, terrible doctor. A total blow hard. Did nothing except a visual exam. My dog had a rash that was spreading very quickly so we we're concerned. No skin test of any kind and no blood work to make sure there were no serious infections or disease. Will never go there again. In AM we took her to out vet to do all the testing.</review>

< Review>
My regular vet recommended transferring my cat here for observation after we accidentally gave her two doses of insulin. I was a little skeptical of this place after reading some bad reviews on Yelp. Because my vet called ahead, they waived the exam fee and also gave us 20% off services here. The vet we spoke to was very kind and knowledgeable and took the time to discuss with us my cat's care plan for the 5 hours my cat would be there. In the end, we ended up paying less than the estimate. I'm glad to know there is a reliable 24hour vet near us for the next time one of my cats has an emergency. My one concern is that my cat had an IV in place in her leg when she arrived, and when she got home, she had a "boo boo" on each front leg. Not sure why that happened, but was so relieved she was okay that I didn't bother following up.</Review>

My little toy poodle needed abdominal surgery and I feel so lucky that Animal Urgent Care was around to take care of her! I saw Dr. Diehl who made this very difficult process easier. She did not sugarcoat anything but made me feel confident in the care my dog was going to get. I would use this facility as many times as I needed for all my pet emergencies.<//Text>

<Text>Our recent visit they wanted to charge us enormous fees - we choose to take our cat home and wait it out for our vet in the AM.  I am so glad we did.  They had misdiagnosed our cat with congestive heart failure and told us it was the worst possible diagnosis.  That it was ok to consider putting him to sleep.  The cat is 3 1/2 years old and had never had a medical issue!  So glad we waited and left AMA. Also, they never called to follow up with us. I guess they wrote us and our cat off since we wouldn't go for their 1800 dollars in fees to keep him over night.< /Text><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcee896354092b:0x1569bc95125a2425< /gmap_id>< rating>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I have had Boxer dogs for over 20 years and have dealt with illnesses, injuries and the ache of losing my babies.  Just today, I had to send my last two Boxers into God's hands.

Dr. Silvia arrived on time and was immediately compassionate and supportive to the tremendous pain I was feeling.  She and her technician were gentle, professional, caring, compassionate, and soothing.  I took my dogs to Three Dogs Bakery for some yummy cookies and treats, took them to the beach to enjoy the ocean breeze on their faces and the surf on their paws, then brought them home and the three of us laid on the grass in the front yard until it was time to go.

It will be some time before my heart recovers but I am glad beyond words that I was able to take care of my sweet, loving dogs by making their last breath one of comfort, laying in the sun with a gentle breeze.  Thank you Dr. Silvia for making a tremendously painful experience in my life more bearable.

We found the staff at Animal Urgent Care of South OC to be very knowledgeable and professional.  Dr. Berschauer clearly explained what was going on with our dog.  He spent quite a bit of time with us and our dog and, although the "news" he had for us was not all good, his manner was compassionate and caring.  The staff was professional and polite.  This was our second experience with Animal Urgent Care and our previous experience was just as good.</text>

On a Sunday evening, I took my 18 year old kitty, Seal, in for an inordinate amount of blood in her urine. It was done out of character on my floor instead of the little box. I knew she needed care post haste.

Facility and Care:

As a pet industry professional and pet steward, I have high standards. In the past, I have walked out of modern, well rated facilities in favor of the downtown strip mall where I know the vet is good and the staff caring. As a careful observer I did take note: it was clean, the vet on duty was kind and understanding (even when I had "mom panic"), and the vet techs were alert and informative.

In my experience, a good vet tech that interacts professionally with both you and your pet is as important as a good vet. They are the ones that monitor your pets vitals, deliver medicine, and have the schlep job of making sure a facility full of equipment and sick, unpredictable animals is safe for your little fuzzbuckets. These guys handled my little girl (and my blubbering, tearful concerns) with efficiency and a smile.

Price:

I feel I was charged fairly for the services and my cat is healthier now after a follow up with my regular vet.

I realize there are industry price differences. I did not get surgery, tests, or any of the usual costly things. I only want to point out that running a facility of this nature here in Orange County is costly, think supplies and space. The techs went to school. They have hard, physical days and emotionally demanding shifts. The Vet went to school, often longer than you and at great expense. They are a business. Because you found it way cheaper online, at clinic, or in the next city over...doesn't mean the facility should eat the difference.

I have had, won, and lost many battles with the medical care of animals. Poor reviews are valued and often warranted for caution, but they are also sometimes written in anger and grief over loss of a loved one (blame has to go somewhere, right?). Or they are over money. The first I can identify with, I take those with a grain of salty tears. The latter I find subject to varied degrees of perception and without the whole story, I can't judge. So I don't. The 18 years of companionship from my cat doesn't have a price tag, whether I am hungry and unemployed or simply surviving in Orange County.</Text>

Our cat was misdiagnosed by our regular vet which led to a critical situation requiring us to bring him to Animal Urgent Care. Dr. Kogan was very caring as he gave us options on how to proceed.  He saved our cat's life and we are indebted to him and the rest of the staff there.< /review>

<review>We brought our beloved Luvie (17 years old)to the Mission Viejo Animal Urgent Care this past week. Once we arrived we knew that Luvie passed on the car ride there. From the moment we walked in to when we left all employees were very sympathic. Two days later we received a bereavement card  with notes from 12 of the associates including Dr. Bob Berschauer. Something they didnt have to do, but they did.  To all there we would like you to know how much this act of kindness was appreciated. Thank you.

On night of the Thanksgivings my Wheaton Terrier stepped on a sharp object and got a deep cut.

The doctor and the staff were most knowledgeable and caring.
I am grateful for the care my Wheaton received.< /Review>

<Review>I cannot say enough to praise Dr. Diehl and the staff of the Animal Urgent Care. We brought our cat here after finding him in very serious condition. Dr. Diehl reviewed her findings and preliminary thoughts on the diagnosis very thoroughly and presented several treatment options for us to consider. Our cat was FIV+ and in serious condition; the chances were very likely that he was battling cancer that he would have extremely low chances of surviving, so we ultimately made the decision to put our friend to rest. We were given as much time as we needed to spend with our furry friend before putting him to sleep and all of the staff was extremely supportive. Dr. Diehl asked if we wanted her to do an autopsy to determine if it was indeed cancer, but we opted not to since we had already made the decision and didn't want to feel guilty if he did not have cancer and find that we had said goodbye too soon. She ended up leaving us a message on our drive home saying that she understood our concerns about the autopsy but wanted us to know that the blood work did confirm that our friend had cancer. It was such a kind, thoughtful gesture that brought us so much peace and relief to know that we had done what was best. This was such an amazing display of compassion that we will never forget. If you ever find yourself in urgent need of care for your pets, I highly recommend the Animal Urgent Care of South Orange County without hesitation.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

< review>
Needless to say, we were highly concerned when we woke one Sunday morning to find that our Siberian husky Tasha had been vomiting and exhibiting bloody diarrhea several times overnight. We were in a cabin 100 miles from our home in southern Orange County, and we knew this was serious because of the potential for severe dehydration so we drove directly to the Animal Urgent Care.
When we arrived, Dr. Diehl, the veterinarian on duty, examined Tasha immediately and tentatively diagnosed her condition as HGE. She put Tash on an IV drip to re-hydrate her and administer medication, and ordered a number of relevant tests, which they were able to perform on site. We left her at the hospital overnight and we were worried that because Tash has acute separation anxiety and especially detests crates and kennels, we thought leaving her overnight might cause her additional stress. Dr. Diehl called us a few hours later with an update on her condition and the results of the tests they had performed. She also told us that in addition to administering a mild sedative, one of the staff was sitting by Tash whenever she was awake to help keep her calm.
Tash looked much improved the next morning when we picked her up to take her to her regular vet, and one week later she seems very nearly back to normal.
All the staff at the urgent care facility were very professional and responsive. In particular, Dr. Diehl's "bedside manner" was superb with both Tasha and her worried humans. We are very fortunate to have such a superb urgent care capability so close to home.<//review>

I recently took my dog to Animal Urgent Care. My dog was throwing up for 3 days and was really dehydrated. Upon the doctors initial inspection she noted that the dog is in fact dehydrated and would need to stay for 12 hrs to be rehydrated. She said she would need to run some tests to see what the problem was. Total cost was around $1800. I said that I couldn't afford this much so she took some stuff out. After the doctor ran a panel on the dog showed that all blood counts don't match up. I paid $230-$275 for the panel. The panel of course showed that she is dehydrated of course! So I made the decision to keep the dog overnight for $1,300 to stay alive and get rehydrated. At 3am another doctor called me to let me know the dog is still vomiting and she would need to run an ex ray for $280 or so. I went forward with it and they found nothing. She said then they need to do an ultrasound to determine if there is a foreign body found cost $290. She then proceeded to tell me if they did find something in the stomach blocking then the dog would need surgery which would run around $3,200 or more. I said I am already into this around $1900 and cannot afford much more. The new doctor came in at 7am who originally diagnosed my dog, she mentioned the costs again. I stated that unfortunately I would have to relinquish my dog to a charity or put the dog down due to financial hardship. They said give us a minute and we will call you back. They said the doctor has been calling around other vets in the area and found a surgeon in Yorba Linda that would complete the surgery and post op for $1800. So I took my pet and completed the surgery at Yorbalinda pet hospital and they found a palm seed in the stomach.
All in all I found them to be very patient and nice however a lot of upselling if I was willing to pay for it. They should just offer to open the dog up for exploratory surgery rather than paying $2,200 or much more to diagnose. I would not bring my pet back again unless I had pet insurance and they paid for the upcharges and hard sell. I will call the doctor at Yorba Linda next time even though it is 30 min. from my house.</text>

I love the music, Pastors, beautiful campus, preschool and all it has to offer. I don't like how the members of this church are antisocial and literally do not interact with each other that is very strange but definitely a Southern California problem. I would love this church more if not for the lack of interaction. I visited this church Sunday and literally not one member said hello to me. It feels like a drive-in or drive-by experience. The staff and volunteers do make an effort to be friendly and welcome visitors but even then it seems like an act. I don't know what to think of this church. I will keep going if for just the amazing band but at the same time it's a lonely experience. Even the children behave like their Parents and that is unfortunate but again typical of Southern California; everyone lives in their own world and are content ignoring each other. It's literally like sitting in a room full of anti-social narcissists but you know what I'm there for the music (the incredibly talented band and singers) and the message.  If not for the singers I wouldn't even bother to go to this church and quite frankly this congregation doesn't deserve such an amazing, talented, gifted band and equally outstanding singers. Don't judge a book by it's cover and although you don't know me don't treat me like a stranger in your church because we are all God's children.</Text>

<text>A true gem and the band is AMAZING! I feel so lucky to live in Orange County where there are so many amazing churches but this one is an amazing experience. It at times does feel like they are theatrical and lacks connections with the members but I love the music and singers!<//text>< Pics>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>They don't really help the needy other than themselves, atmosphere is really anti social,  seems like their only concern is to fill up their own pockets and/or profit to gain,won't help homeless families or people in need, they just seem to want your money by sending the tithe around about 4 times during 1 service, not my idea of a great Church,  greedy is more cumbersome... Don't attend this Church bunch of phonies</text>< Pics>

Love this church. The pastors and the community are all so nice, caring, friendly, and wonderful. I love the amount of services and extra ministries they have. Everyone wants to just lift eachother up, and help out whenever they can. Beautiful singers and beautiful congregation.< /Text>

<review>I have experienced nothing but warm and friendly people who display genuine concern at SeaCoast Grace. The worship team seems to know what song ministers to me when I'm feeling a bit down and Pastors Doyle and Cody know how to perk up a service. 🙂</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I love this church.  The pastors are so inspirational!  And I love that they are down to earth, honest about their own struggles, and tie the biblical messages into our day to day struggles.</Text>

<rate>5<//rate><text>We normally go to Parkcrest, but we went on Saturday needing a little carryover worship... it's always nice to change it up to see what other churches have to offer, this church is massive!! Very nice buildings, nice Auditorium great music program wonderful singers maybe I'm a little biased with my church in that the Pastor was very different and it usually is in different churches, I didn't follow him as well as I do with my pastor at Parkcrest but overall our experience was great and we will go back for another Saturday worship.<//text>< pictures>

The music/singing is truly inspiring and diverse. The people are wonderfull but not too friendly/pushy like some churches can be.  Just the best overall atmosphere to worship God< /Review>

<Text>The prices are not high. Realistically similar to other taco shops.  San Diego,  CA is just expensive period. This isnt the year 2000 anymore people...when a burrito was $3.50.
Great food. Nice employees. Overall positive experience</Text>< Rating>

I ordered 5 beef roll tacos. First of all they only put guacamole and cheese on the beef for $7. So I decided to add lettuce and sour cream to it so they can taste better. They gave me my order, so I drove home. When I got home and opened it it looked so bad. They were way too small, and they had charge me $9 for it. So I went back and asked them for my money back cause it was a rip off. I had not touched them whatsoever, but they refused to exchange or provide my money back. It was not worth buying from there at all. It’s a total rip off, I DO NOT RECOMEND IT TO ANYONE!!! If you are looking for a better Mexican restraunt with better quality food, and getting for hat you pay for I suggest SANTANA’S on Lemon Grove Ave.</review>

I went In on May 4th 2018 at around 7:00pm. the girl behind the counter was on the phone the WHOLE time, kept rolling her eyes. she had an attitude when I ordered my food, because I guess we interrupted her break. as I sit down to wait for my food, she is still on her phone and she proceeds to curse and be obnoxious, not professional at all. the man that cooked my food that night was very nice and had no problem bagging my food while his coworker just talked away...the food is way over priced...and it wasn't that good..</text>

Pretty standard mexican food you can get at most similar restaurants...nothing too different-but well executed. The paintings and artwork is the real gem/highlight of this place... The owner has a nice ranfla and invites car clubs to join up there. Overall, its a great lil family owned establishment. Support local business.<//review>

If there was an option to not give a star, that would be my choice! The customer service was horrible at the Lemon Grove location.The male employee stood in the back looking at us without asking if we were ready to order, then the female employee came out of the bathroom to take our order. I asked if they have veggie nachos, she said “no!” Are you a vegetarian or something? We have veggie burritos or potato tacos! I said no thank you! I would like an order of pollo asado nachos minus the pollo. She said are you sure??!! I said, it’s okay, I’m going to pass!!!

# Horrible customer service for sure!!! I’ve eaten at Los Tito’s in other locations and always had great service ordering “non meat items!”<//text>

Just went to the Tito's in Lemon Grove decided to try it out for the first time and well not to impress.  I paid way to much for what I got $30 for 2 carne asada burritos and I full plate of carne asada fries. The burritos were super small not worth $8.00 and the fries were hard like they have sitting for a while. I don't think I'll be heading there anymore.</text>

<Text>Driest Carne Asada I've ever had, tiny burrito, way over priced, and somehow subbing Sour Cream for Guac got me charged a dollar and change on top of the overpriced burrito. Will not be back, wish they had kept Delicias Taco Shop instead, thank goodness Nando's is just around the corner.</Text>< Pics>

I stopped by late night a little after ten pm and they're supposed to close at 11. Went straight up to the counter to order then the female at the register came out of from the back and said they were closed. I stated that the hours say they are open until 11. She gave an attitude and said " no, we're closed foo." Food is pricey and customer service is trash. Don't recommend this place. Taqueria imperial is worth the 5 extra minute drive.< /review>

Mostly you will find paved paths that take you down to the local pier, where you can do fishing 🎣 😉 or just take in the scenic Bay views! There are giant oak trees & lots of Eucalyptus trees as well. This park is not crowded and, with the interesting walk along the steep cliffs, deserves a visit! I'll be back with my 👪 family! The best things in life are free!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Point Pinole Regional Shoreline is a great place to go hiking. The trail system throughout the park are mostly flat with great Bay views, large eucalyptus trees, and a pier out to the Bay.< /Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Beautiful walking trails that range around the park. If you get on the dirt trails you can get out to the fishing pier. Pretty good number of lines at the end of the pier so I guess you'd have to get there early if you're interested in such things. Otherwise beautiful views and not overly crowded which was really nice.
Parking lot was nearly fall but we did have a spot to park. Lots of bathrooms and drinking fountains so that was convenient.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Time>1617670196232<//Time><Review>I always love coming here. When we arrived the lot was full so the ranger person told us to go back to Giant Hwy and take a left, drive down a half mile or so and there is another parking lot. It was almost empty and had no fees! I'll start my adventure at that entrance from now on! Beautiful views of the bay and you can walk along the beach. Great place for a picnic or family outing.< /Review><GmapID>0x808576224f2ef1c7:0xb06738a31f92f579</GmapID><Resp>None< /Resp><Name>Tiffany Newcomer<//Name></record>

This area is so beautiful! You don't even know your exercising.  One minute your waking in the woods, next your on the shoreline.  Truly all senses  are activated here. You'll think.... why haven't I been here before< /Text>

<Date>1614996355435<//Date><Rating>4<//Rating><Text>Lovely place for strolling, more of a community park than a true nature park. This used to be the site of the Atlas Powder Works, a dynamite and gunpowder manufactory. The relics of the factory are fascinating: moldering blast walls in the woods. Capitalist ruins. Lots of debris on the shoreline. The land is overproduced and a bit bleak--the eucalyptus were planted with the factory and have taken over.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOx7HjFFXTVg3En4iQYmFd_t7G-ht-P25Ih2DM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOleAKfRqX1DW3f6fJCDFgVg608x6jYFrig_D4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuPMu0_GYuEopcUF6R0m6szDJwDESrqdahC4s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJvE6L8VaTw71Yb3u8H0TBqNOrPN3KzPsqfhY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-6OYhESgYMVr-2b8E5NuqFk_sFwERZ5KIRRE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOP8Z_dlinYf5aIg7Fjvfb8s7V9qi7oQoqqg_g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Response>

Big, beautiful park, perfect for walking dogs. All types of surrounding: fields, forests, beaches, and some sharp cliffs. Enjoy the variety — you can walk a new trail every time you visit. Parking can be a challenge at times due to popularity, especially on the weekends.<//review>

I love how many different trails their are here. We are able to explore with our kiddos different directions and see a beautiful view no matter where we turn. I enjoy going around sunset to see the sun make the trees look golden! I wish I had a professional camera to capture the beautiful lighting. The view with the water and wide Bay is also one of my favorite views in the East Bay.
My 3 and 5yr old love running through the trails carefree, safe, and happy.</Text>

This was a great!! place to ride our bikes. We hadn’t been here before. Wide open spaces and nice views of the bay. Many hikers. Some with dogs. People fishing off the pier. Haze over the water obscured the views south toward the Richmond-San Rafael bridge but could see shores to the north just fine. We were fortunate to have spring-like weather in January. Mostly flat trails as you follow the shore. Many signs. Used the AllTrails app to navigate. Not too crowded, but the parking lot was pretty full. Visited on a Friday. Will likely come back some time.<//review>

Great loop with wide-open spaces, minimal hills, a long pier, a cliff, some pav d paths good for biking and two parking lots.  Went on a weekday so curious what it's like on weekends.</text>

Great little regional park with paved and gravel trails for horses, bikes and pedestrians. The latest section added a few years back extends the park south to the Richmond Rod and Gun Club, with picturesque trails running north along the water, extending out onto a long pier. Great views throughout the park, and 2 different locations equipped with picnic tables and facilities to hold barbecues, parties and other outdoor celebrations!</review>

Not crowded and well kept. Has really long trails for runs and bike rides. Most people were wearing masks. Keep in mind you have to walk about 20 minutes from parking lot to the pier. It can get quite warm in the summer since tree shade coverage is not wide spread across the area. You can still find some partially shaded trails.<//text>

It is a nice place to get out and do some trails, bike, even fish at the pier.
There are two spots to park. Sometimes you have to pay to park, during summer.
There are bathrooms.
During COVID:  no picnic areas open or fountains, masks required.
Bring water and snacks.<//Text>

Easy hikes on paved or compacted gravel paths. Lots of parking at the paid admission gates. Cars are $3, with extra for dogs. There's a shuttle service that takes you around to a few places in the park.

The main gate is staffed, but the other parking areas further south aren't.

Picnic tables with BBQ pits, washrooms, and a play area. Lots of grassland fields for kids to play.

All dogs need to be on a leash 🐕❤️< /Text>

<text>My girlfriend and I love walking with our dogs at this park. Plenty of opportunity for the dogs to jump in the water. Great views of San Pablo Bay. Two parking lots, the one I park at has restrooms and garbage cans. Highly recommend.<//text>< Rate>

Beautiful views of the bay dotted with old growth trees.

3 starts because you can hear constant gunshots coming from the gun range just south of the park. They are only heard on the west side - east side is quiet.</Review>

We loved visiting this park. We went mid week, so it wasn’t too busy, but there were a few people around.

There are quite a few trail options to explore, but you could explore them all in an afternoon. We took the woods trail to maximize the shady walking time.

The trail was lovely, with giant trees and even some wild blackberry bushes in the underbrush. It took about 5-10 minutes to reach the trail overlooking the bay, but there were nice sea breezes the entire time.

Up near the bay, there is a playground and picnic area which would be great for kids. Overall a very nice area and I’d love to return.<//review>

This is one of my favorite places for hikes with my kiddos and my trail runs. But lately seems like people can’t control their dogs, even though but says dogs on leash, some are not train and people don’t have common sense. Or just don’t care. A little girl was bitten  just a couple of months ago and now I always have to watch my children’s back when we go for runs. Too bad 😕<//Review>

A great park to bring your dog (or not), I've brought our dog here for the past 3-4 years, but last week the East Bay Regional Park District was hosting an event here (What's Brewin in the Park), we ended up hanging out in the grassy area, something we never do, and when we got home our poor little pup had ticks! Her first time ever! The summer also brings a huge annoyance of other flies, mosquitoes, and bugs which can and has made our visit all the less enjoyable. Besides that, the park and trails are very nice. The sunset at the pier can be amazing!

<Text>One of my favorite places in the entire Bay Area. I always spend an entire day here when I can and make sure I bring a picnic lunch. When I moved to the other side of the Bay, I'm not here much and miss it but I make my way here every now and then. Rambling through the eucalyptus forest and strolling along the shoreline is very therapeutic. I always see families holding events here too--quite a popular spot. I recommend checking the EBRPD website to download the flora and fauna downloadable guides to learn something.</Text></record></dataset><record>

You had to walk almost a mile to the pier and then there was no bites it was dead but for location view and possibilities on good three stars</Text>

<rate>5<//rate><response>None< /response><Review>This is one of the most beautiful regional parks in the area. There is a shoreline and shady wooded areas. It’s generally not too crowded and I’ve spent time walking, hiking, biking and jogging in this park. There is also a dock which some people fish at. I almost don’t want to leave a review because I like to keep this place to myself but it makes me grateful to live in this area. It’s an escape from the crazy traffic and rude drivers in this area. Calm, serene, gorgeous, A+< /Review>< Time>

Quit complaining about the walk and get some exercise! Unless you are incapable of walking a couple miles to the pier, there is a shuttle that runs early in the morning and ends around 3:30pm, about a $1 to ride. Fishing here could not get any better in the Bay Area (of course there’s those days nothing bites) . . Frozen anchovies catches everything at this pier, striped bass, sturgeon, halibut, stingrays, sharks. A crab net would be ideal if you hook on to a big stingray to pull him up and avoid cutting line, or having to walk all the way down the pier to take the hook out.</text>

Great small park, limited parking but never too busy. Enough to do: play structure for the kids, a pier to fish, bike lanes, hike trails, bird watching, picknick places, benches to take a break and plenty of public bathrooms.</Review>

Beautiful sightlines of the Bay. Ospreys, Western Bluebirds, Night Herons abound. The park is big enough that you run into few people but when you do they mask up. And many of them have fabulous dogs. Altogether a rich experience. Thank you @ebrpd<//text>

Huge park with lots of paved and unpaved trails. Tons, tons of dogs off leash, tons of people without masks, lots of kids on bikes. Bring your sunscreen. Beautiful bay views.<//Review>

Always the best times here! The ocean scenery is wonderful and the park is glorious. I never knew it even existed until I met my boyfriend who lives in the region. As a boy he would run laps there.

They have been making major improvements like new trails and newer restrooms and native plant restorations, etc. throughout the park and expanding the park as well!</text>

The place is little bit far from popular places to walk, so not many people there. Even in holidays it is easy to get a table with ocean view and a grille. There is a road suitable for strollers and plenty of trails for mountain bicycles. Also, the smell of eucalyptus follows is everywhere. One downside, that on majority of territory dogs should be on leash all time.< /Text>

The staff is absolutely outstandingly fabulous taking care of the facilities for visitors & the entire park. They make their big job look,  easy for us to enjoy such clean, well stocked, well maintained bathrooms, picnic areas, dog waste pickup dispensers, trashcans, everything.  A safe & clean family facility.
Thank you Park Crew. I really appreciate it!

Started taking my dog out here recently as an alternative to Miller Knox Regional Park. Beautiful, interesting place with miles of paved and unpaved trails. It has shoreline access and a long fishing pier. I love the views of the San Pablo Bay and the remnants of the former Giant Dynamite Company. Easy hiking for people who are used to lots of hills. From the lot to the pier and back is about 3 miles round trip with several trail options. Recommend for people who love fresh air and sweeping views.< /Text>

<text>I've been going to this park for 35 years... Before I can remember... And up to the age when I was about 5 or so. But I've had numerous birthday parties here. I've rode my bike as a kid out to the pier so many times. I've taken my dogs there and I still go there to walk. Great paved trails. Great views of mt tam. I love the calm San Pablo Bay water. The pier is beautiful. Worth the Walk out to it!</text>< pictures>

<Review>I went running here for the first time today and the trail I took had a great view. There are many paths to shorten or elongate a route. The path I took was between 2.5 and 3 miles. The specific route I took also had some elevation changes, so great for cross country runners.

Get to the park before 5pm to park in the parking lot. You will be allowed to leave up until 10pm. I saw many cars park outside along the road after 5pm, but I took the safe option (because I thought I saw a sign say you're not supposed to park there) and parked in a neighborhood a couple blocks down.< /Review>< Time>

This place is a great place to come and have a quick run, watch the sunset see a bit of beach a bit of forest. I havent noticed the pests much at all here so if you dont want to chance it too much with things like mosquitos and ticks the layout seems prety good for staying away from brush. I like going down to the beach head and collecting a few shells. Also the sun setting in the little medow accross the parking lot brings in beautiful hues of gold and orange. I like it since its close to me and easy access. Only downside is unlike other parks, if the parking lot closes early this one you would find hard to park your car outside the lot. To enjoy that last hour of sunset time In the late summer sun.</Text>

Love this area - great for dog walks, runs, and apparently fishing! I usually meet friends for walking or running early in the morning, and there's so many people with serious fishing gear.  They are constantly upgrading the amenities here, there are on- and off leash areas for dogs, and it's well maintained.< /review>

Lots of trails to bike and hike. One trail leads to the pier, which gives you a spectacular view. Very quiet as well.<//Review>

<Text>Great place for a walk. At the end of a few trails is a pier where you can see many people fishing with multiple rods. There are bathrooms and drinking fountain near the pier. I’ve seen horses and dogs here so there might be some dropping’s on the trail. Besides that there’s lots of shade for hot days and the wind feels pretty good most of the time. Some of the trail is paved while most of it isn’t. There are a few picnic spots but only half of them have grills. You typically DO NOT have to pay but if there is an attendant at the booth, it costs less than $5. The only time I have seen an attendant was during July 4th weekend (probably for holidays only). Love his place you should visit at least once.<//Text><Date>1562737801511< /Date><Gmap_id>0x808576224f2ef1c7:0xb06738a31f92f579<//Gmap_id><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

One of my favorite places to walk! The weather is very unpredictable here. Sometimes it could just be different everywhere  the same day depending on where you are in the park. Nice for gatherings but a long walk and hard to carry a lot of things in. Great fishing! Some of the biggest stripers I've ever seen were caught here. It's a shame they don't stay open later they close parking lot early, but it's for safety.</text>

I love taking my dogs here as much as they love hiking and swimming here. It's such a lovely place that's easy to miss if you don't know how to find it, but has become one of my absolute favorite parks in Contra Costa county! Definitely worth checking out and never crowded, as there's so much space to roam!< /Text>

Our favorite place to walk with dogs. So many trail choices: short loops to long rambles, and tree-shaded or full sun paths.  Canine parents we've met are dog-savvy and respectful, leashing up or moving to the side if you are leashed and they aren't.  New parking lot with clean, well-maintained public restrooms and a low faucet in front for dog-watering.  Just the best!<//text>

Point Pinole is an amazing place for a run or to take your family out for the weekend. The water front side is a great place to bike and they also have a lot of dogs.</review>

Spectacular place to walk or bike. Fantastic eucalyptus trees, which were originally planted to absorb the blast in case the dynamite plant blew up! The fishing from the public pier is outstanding. Lots of people catch stripped bass and good sized perch. There is a van service by the park staff to take you out there and back. Otherwise it's a mile or more walk from the parking lot. Good restrooms.< /Text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Review>Great trails for running or walking. With eucalyptus tree's for shade, open meadows with ocean views and even a fishing pier. Great place for pets but like any open area, be aware of ticks, mosquitoes and poison oak. Generally if you stay on the trails, you will be ok. During the off peak season parking is generally free on weekdays but as summer comes along expect a parking attendant to be on duty.< /Review>< time>

< review>
Uncrowded park with many nearly level trails.  One trail, from the Giant Road Entrance all the way out to the pier is paved, making this a great trail for strollers, for kids on bicycles, and wheelchairs.  The other main trails are well maintained, mostly gravelled, and walkable without getting too muddy even after rain.  The trails on the west side have good bay views and take you through the historic dynamite factory areas, where you can still see the foundations of some of the buildings.  Flush toilets at the Atlas road entrance, pit toilets at the Giant Hwy entrance, at the playground, and out toward the pier.  Water at both entrances, at the playground, and out at the pier.  The playground is about 1/4 mile in from the Giant Hwy entrance and has a small amount of playground equipment.  Also at the playground area, there is a horseshoe pit and sometimes a volleyball net is set up.  There are at least three large group picnic areas with several picnic tables at each and large groups are often at these locations in nice weather.  Dogs are welcome on leash throughout the park and off leash away from the entrances and playground.  Unlike many parks, rangers seem to always be present at this one, and even run a shuttle from the Giant Hwy entrance all the way out to the pier and back.< /review>

<review>Beautiful scenery and a must for a fantastic walk. Park has about 12 miles of trails for running or jogging.

Want to picnic? No problem 👍 park has picnic areas and playground for kids. Has restrooms throughout the park and for fishing enthusiastics, the park has a pier for that too. All in all, a great place for the entire family 😎</review>< date>

If I could give a negative starred review, I would. I arrived at this location around 2:06 PM on 9/15/19 in the afternoon and realized I was in the wrong location. I asked for a refund, which is what it states on the receipt, that you can request one if you exit in 20 minutes or less. There was one elderly Caucasian gentleman who was manning the collection booth and he told me that there was no one for me to talk to and that my $ 3 would be considered a donation. If you do not honor refunds then do not state so on your receipt. This old guy really, really pisse me TF off.  I will never ever go to this park, which I ended up at by mistake anyway.<//review>

You really have to use your Imagination in calling this a "park" the restrooms especially seemed very City Like w all the dirty hamsters nesting in here..

There is no dirtier animal than the human species

Police always sliding thru I guess because of the detention facility next door they can't resist ..Not a place I would return. Unless I had to.< /Text>

<text>I don’t want to say how fabulous this park is because then it might get crowded!! Nice picnic areas; has a shuttle pick up from parking lot to the pier; beautiful bay views; and plenty of trails - both sunny and shaded. Good place to bring your dog, have a picnic lunch, and go for a hike. Parking fee is reasonable - $3.00 and extra for dog. W are there almost every weekend. Best kept secret in East Bay - so don’t tell anyone! We enjoy the lack of crowds.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>The walk along the water on the south and west side up to the fishing pier is lovely, with several options depending on the tide.  On the north and east side there's a marsh with challenging pathways through it, or not, and in the middle, mostly, there's forests of eucalyptus trees.  There is one magnificent eucalyptus at the picnic grounds near the entrance.  The place is also a great site for safe, traffic-free bicycling.<//Text>< Pics>

Loved the views of the San Francisco bay, bay bridge and Golden Gate bridge. Extremely dog friendly park where all the dogs seem to get along well together. There is a snack bar, plumbed restrooms and plenty of picnic space to lounge and enjoy.
The park sits along the Bay Trail which allows you to really get some exercise walking, biking, etc.
One drawback is the limited parking onsite.<//review>

< Review>
This place is so beautiful so peaceful it has amazing sunset .its really good to take a walk around the small beach  it’s really cool to have a picnic with friends and family because it is small and most people don’t know about it so its not crowded and its like private its kid friendly there is nothing dangerous there is a basketball court near by so people can play basketball.its like a super cool spot but remember to bring a jacket and beware of insects and mosquitos there are alot when it starts to fall evening</Review>

<Time>1562523553425< /Time><text>So peaceful and quiet weekday walk are the best. Good fishing although I haven't fished there since I was a kid..Weekday walks it seems as though you have the park to yourselves Although others are walking or bike riding.. Friday's are free parking for July. Sometimes they hold events there I didn't know this until this last weekend the parking lot went into overflow status some race event was being held.
But not all weekends are mass people events.. It's just a great place to take a 3 mile hike out to the shoreline/pier & back. I've had knowledge of the park since day 1 built back in 1976 if memory serves me correctly I was in the 3rd grade but the fishing was better back then than it is now.. I've witnessed s decline in the majority of the posted species that are supposed to be catchable there unfortunately the SF Bay has seen an increase in the pollution column species such as King Fish & Perch & Starry Flounder are gone as far as I can tell most people catch Jack Smelt, Striped Bass, Leppord Shark, Sand Sharks, Sting Rays. Uncertain as to whether or not there catching any Halibut out that far North but all these before mentioned species are also seasonal and the Striper groups tend to travel the Bay so tracking there hideouts is knowledge based.. That's all I really know
Parking is $3.00 dogs must be on leashes people break this park posted rule.. Not to many wild animals other than birds. Fresh air & pods/groves of eucalyptus trees everywhere.. Great place for picnics & restrooms are abundant if needed.< /text>< response>

Was gonna go but realized by the reviews that this is another dog's heaven. Miss the days when dogs ran freely in the nearest trash dump and played amongst themselves doing what dogs like to do rather then be forcibly sharing traditional human spaces by their obnoxious clueless OWNERS</text>

Go here often to walk the dog / take a stroll.  Great place.   Fishing off the pier is popular - Im not much of a fisherman though.<//review>

I love it here but to be honest people do bring big dogs often with no leash I wish I could be comfortable here. Other than that it's a very nice place.<//text>

Nice and quiet. Great bay breeze. Take the trail by the bay. Parts of it are marked as closed due to falling trees.</Text>

This is a great park for hikes and walking. The only downside is that dogs are not allowed in any water areas, so no beaches, pools, ponds or marshland. Lots of poison oak around as well, so be careful<//text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>Point Pinole is a beautiful park that's got lots of trails and is easily accessible. The posted rules state that dogs need to be kept on a leash. About 35% - 50% of people actually adhere to this rule, which is very frustrating. There's no enforcement of the rule from what I can tell.< /Review>< pictures>

Parking on weekends is no longer free, they want $5 and a dog fee. Nice park, though. Very clean and well kept.</Text>

It's a great place to bring your family,friends and BBQ! Plus if your into fishing, there is pier at the other side. Into walking, walking your dog or horse,running & biking?  Trails both on concrete and dirt are available to enjoy the scenery.< /Text>

Very nice park, open spaces with plenty of trails. Also a fishing pier. And a shuttle to ride you from parking lot to picnic areas for a very small fee.<//Text>

A beautiful setting for a regional park. It sits on a peninsula on San Pablo Bay and the Bay View Trail offers nice views of the Bay with Mt. Tamalpais in the background. The park trails are mostly level with a few mild inclines along the way. There's a shuttle service from the parking lot all the way to the tip of the peninsula which run on the half hour until 2:30pm.</Text>

I don't want to write this review because I'm going to give away how great this place is, but I'm going to say this is a great place for a run in the morning!!

I love this place like no tomorrow and I never get tired of it because there are so many ways to run through the trails. This park is expanding and I have never been so happy for it.

On weekends they do charge $3 per vehicle and maybe more for campers and what not, but this can be all avoided if you come in when they just open up the gates (between 7am-8am) and when they have huge events like half marathons.

That is all I'm saying about this place. . . Oh and they have the cutest dogs that come through if you're into that thing. =]<//Text>

Great low impact run or stroller walk. Paved and unpaved roads. Plenty of parking. Minus 1 star for tearing down the kids playground that used to be there.<//text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><text>It was quaint and cute, with a fair amount of things to see, but there wasn't a ton to do and it was very windy, even on what was a warm summer day in the rest of the Bay Area. Parking was only $3 though, and you didn't have to pay for entry. Very cute park with play structures, a volleyball court, and a great view of the bay.<//text>< userid>

The reason for 3 stars is as follows. The shoreline is inaccessible in several parts due to erosion. And some of the trails were not open during the time of our visit due to this (4/18)<//Text>

I was there yesterday.. what’s up with that guy at the gate?? His dogs came around sniffing me?? Aren’t we allowed at the shoreline without being checked?? His dogs were sorrounding me, sniffing as if I’d do something! When I asked him; he replied” i am doing this for eco-friendly environment “.. WTH!</Review>

Some really nice trails and beautiful views of Mt. Tamalpais and San Pablo Bay. It was really quiet on the trails and there were plenty of benches in the picnic areas. I look forward to taking my mtn bike here once it gets warmer.

The signage says it's free parking when the booth is not manned.</text>

This large park is a paradise for walkers, bikers, picnickers and fishers, tucked out of the way against the San Francisco Bay in a semi-hidden location in Pinole. A large picnic area with play structures is near the park entrance, although you have to walk some distance to reach it from the parking lot.< /Review>

Well I believe the park itself needs to be redone so that the youth nearby can once again utilized as a place of recreation like it was when I was a youth if not even better thank you.<//review>
