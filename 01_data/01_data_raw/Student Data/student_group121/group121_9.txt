I really enjoyed my experience at Dr Thompson’s office. The look and the vibe of the office is great, and the entire staff was friendly, cool and enjoyable to talk to.

I had a general cleaning with x-rays and photos taken and the dental hygienist, Sam, was very helpful in giving me some tips on brushing given what she saw in the photos.

Dr Thompson came in and finished up and it was a smooth, enjoyable process. (I’m not exactly busting down the door to have people digging and scraping in my mouth, so the fact that it was enjoyable experience means a lot for me)

Highly recommend coming to this office for your dental needs!< /Text>

<Review>Dr. Thompson is a MAGNIFICENT dentist!!! For a fact, he knows his craft!  Dr. Thompson is willing to provide thorough answers to questions that his patients may ask in reference to their dental care. He has a very nice personality and goes the extra mile to ensure that his patients are given the necessary attention they need. The whole office staff is AMAZING!  Super friendly and helpful. I appreciate all of the excellent care that was extended to me on my first office visit today, Wednesday, April 14, 2021, for my dental exam and teeth cleaning.

I highly recommend Dr. Thompson’s Dental office!!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Dr. Derrick Thompson (and his team) are absolutely amazing! He is very detail oriented with his work while still providing fast efficient service. There was no pain afterwards and the swelling went down in record time. Fully recommend Dr. Thompson if you are in search of a new dentist. The dental spa looks and smells very inviting (and they even provide a very cozy blanket to keep you warm during your visit). Thank you!<//Text>

Love Dr Thompson and his staff!! When I come to my appointments with, I’m usually in a rush and need to be seen on time! I have also needed to be squeezed in at the last minute too! But each time he and his lovely staff accommodate me and have ALWAYS been so nice and professional! Dr Thompson does a thorough job and handles my teeth with care! I am almost done with my Invisalign, but will continue to come see him for my future dental needs!</Text>

I don’t like going to the dentist 🦷 but my sister referred me to Dr. Thompson and it was the best experience. The entire staff was kind, funny and professional. FYI-After all my work is done I will be acting funny with everybody but God. I’m so thankful to be a patient of this great team.< /Review>

The staff were very nice and welcoming. Dr. Thompson is one of the best dentist I have had. I would definitely recommend Dr. Thompson and his team to anyone looking for a new dentist. My appt was at 9AM and I was seen no later than 9:10 if that. Only con is parking. There is street parking but being in LA can be all taken up. There is a parking lot for a $10 fee. I wish they would do comp parking for those visiting in the offices in the building or a reduce fee to maybe $3-5.<//Text>

I was pleasantly surprised by the great customer service I received. I started from my initial contact with Candy at the front desk. My experience with the teeth cleaning and X-Ray exams done by Bianca was wonderful. And to finish off with Dr. Thompson and his professionalism and delivery of services. I enjoyed my time there. I was seen immediately and did not stay long. Overall, customer service was out of this world. The office was clean and welcoming. I will definitely return for needed treatment and future routine visits. Thank you Dr. Thompson and your staff.<//Text>

Addtl note : Re: Covid: They take the necessary cautions with cleaning each room and before you enter the office. But the office was clean before this pandemic as well.

Update: I had a deep cleaning with Zan today and she gets 5 stars. Very thorough and just a pleasure to have work on my teeth.<//review>< pics>

<Review>I have been going to Dr. Thompson since I was a kid and ever since I can remember, he has provided a level of kindness, comfortability, and tenderness that is rarely seen among dentist. Whether your seeing him for a simple cleaning, or an extraction, Dr. Thompson and his staff can do it all with ease.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c2bb60da280f03:0xa215f3a9d846592a<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Contacted this office for a last minute emergency Extraction. The experience from the initial phone call till completion was a positive experience. This coming from a person with Dentist Anxiety. I would highly recommend this Dr Thompson with no reservation as I was pleasantly pleased about an otherwise normally Traumatic situation for me.<//Review>

Never have I felt so comfortable sitting in the dentist chair. While listening to soothing music via the dentist headset and being comforted by the assistant the dentist worked magic and extract my tooth with very little notice on my part. Unfortunately I must rewrite my review. Two days after I left this Denis office I experience lockjaw. That was his diagnosis after I called him back to ask him why I cannot open my mouth.  I also must say he did not once asked me to come into the office to re-evaluate my jaw. He subscribe me over the phone pain pills and muscle relaxers, and then told me I needed jar therapy. That I had to pay for. Today is December 29 approximately 2 1/2 months later and my jaw is now only halfway open. And the last six weeks this Dennis has not called me once. (Do not go to the dentist).</text>

Once you ring the door bell you'll be greeted with a welcoming smile ..  temper check before entry hand sanitizer available..

the sound of water falls as soft music plays reminds me of a day at the spa
the aroma in the room  is a comfortable scent. As you wait thiers a selection of magazine that might interest you.

The entire staff is Professional patient and immeadately thier to service your smile.. WHAT A TEAM!! THANK YOU!!< /review>

During my initial interaction with Dionne to schedule my appointment to replace an old crown, I immediately knew the practice was staffed with professionals skilled in stellar patient care, customer service and attention to detail.  My in-person visit amplified my initial experience to an even greater level.  Dr. Thompson and the staff are all knowledgeable and considerate in making sure you understand all aspects including your individual dental needs, insurance coverage, and the impressive advanced technology used in the dental room. I am so pleased to have found a practice that treats their patients with the honesty, care and respect as they would their own family!<//review>< Pics>

<review>Thank you Dr. Thompson and staff!  My experience was really cool.  I am now conscious of how to brush my teeth and they look and feel great!  I am eleven and was really unclear of the importance of how long I should brush.  It has made a difference and I am grateful.< /review><username>KAI PIERFAX STENHOUSE<//username>< user>

<text>I’ve been going to Dr. Thompson for about 20 years and have always been very pleased with his chair side mannerism. Dr. Thompson and staff go through great lengths to ensure that the level of service and care is extended from first point of contact through final treatment. These days I’ve relocated to Chicago but have decided that commuting in to continue dental care with his office is well worth it. I am also proud to support a Black-owned practice and aide in the efforts to ensure African-American owned businesses continue to thrive!</text>< pics>

I have been seeing Dr Thompson since 2009! Currently I’m doing the Invisalign treatment and seeing results!

The staff is always wonderful, professional and accommodating! Shot out to the OGs Dana & Dion! I referred my little sister to Dr. Who did an amazing job! She definitely smiles way more these days😁

They have been keeping great sanitation under this pandemic even more than they normally. I have to go in once a month for new trays .

Thanks Heath Heroes!
Greatly appreciate you 🖤</Text>

I had a cracked/chipped tooth. I called Dr. Thompson’s office about this. Dr. Thompson called me back personally and scheduled me in within a few days. The procedure went well and I continue to be extremely satisfied with Dr. Thompson’s services. I highly recommend his services to anyone! Thanks Dr. Thompson!

<user_name>A.D. Murphy<//user_name><review>From the initial point of contact, I was impressed. As many of us know , the dentist isn't everyone's favorite place to visit. Atleast for me it isn't. I had did my best to avoid going all of 2019. That was a success, however, realizing that I needed work done, I had prayed that sent me a better dentist and dental environment than the one I was used to. A friend of mine actually referred me, and the fact that they reached out first to set my cleaning and initial appointment up made me feel comfortable and cared for. Everyone I spoke to on the phone was pleasant. They made sure that I was informed on everything and my appointment was set.

Upon arrival, I was even more impressed with the ambiance. I loved the lobby area decor. And I was glad to see that it smelled very pleasant. Deon greeted me and made me feel extremely comfortable and Samantha put me at ease as she deep cleaned my teeth. Though it did hurt, she informed me of how to take better care of my teeth so that the next time wouldn't be as painful.

I am so crazy that I scheduled an appointment the following day to get my wisdom tooth pulled. lol. I know. Crazy! Dr.Thompson is great at what he does. The technology at the office is update to date and I love that they give you an option to listen to music with headphones, while you get your service done. If you're wondering the procedure went well and I didn't feel a thing.

I am convinced that I have found MY DOCTOR for life and I am so glad my friend posted the video that she posted or I probably would've gone another year without going to the dentist!< /review>< Pictures>

Dr. Thompson and his staff are absolutely amazing, professional and knowledgeable.  I can't say enough good things about them.  My whole family and several friends go to him.

So many dentist are out there and always trying to squeeze every dime they can out of you, pressuring you into unneeded dental work but not Dr. Thompson.

Not many people like going to the dentist and this office goes out of their way to make it a wonderful experience.  Forget about dreading going to the dentist, you are in good hands here.  You won't be disappointed!

A good dentist and office like this are a true find.< /review>

Will never recommend or use this company again. Purchased  firepit. decorative cement fireballs and cover in November, spent several thousands of dollars, used it several times and for the winter we covered it. On April 1 we uncovered it to use and the cement fireballs were eroded. Contact customer service that day and spent the entire month into May trying to correct situation asking for a refund or replacement. I was told sorry for the inconvenience there is nothing they will do.  Spent over $700 for the cement fireballs and the company will not stand behind their products.  Terrible customer service and do not stand by their product. Warning - in my opinion, they do not stand behind what they sell<//review>

I called Steven with no experience and a vague expectation of success.  He talked me through my project from start to finish.  He was very detailed in his questions concerning my safety and experience level.  I purchased a H burner and reflective glass that he suggested.  I had the correct amount because he helped me calculate my needs.  The Starfiredirect products are fantastic. It really holds the heat unlike gas’s logs.  I would recommend this company for a quality product and excellent service.<//Text>

On January 14, 2021 I ordered a Ventura real flame fire table from Starfire. Their representative told me that the table was in stock and would be shipped on January 31.  I was told that since they were in stock there would be no problem filling the order. I selected the table and Starfire because I was told that this table was in stock and ready to go with no waiting. I paid for the table in full. The 31st came and went with no word from Starfire. After calling them I found out that the fire table was on back order. I was told that the table would be in on March 31.  Two weeks before the 31st I called Starfire and was assured the table would be in and would be delivered within a couple of days from the 31st and probably would be in and delivered before that date. This date came and went and still no table.  I just found out after checking their website that the table is again on back order and is now expected for April 14.  I have been strung along for nearly 3 months with no end in sight.  There is zero communication from Starfire when the product goes on back order. A phone call or even an email would be appreciated. I would not recommend this company and regret spending nearly $2,000 on this table.< /Review>

Starfire Direct has the absolute best customer service we've found. Shopped many local and online stores during covid and were given 3-4 month wait for products. Though their website indicated in-stock products could be 2 week delivery, I called and spoke to Mitchell who ensured me the products were in stock. We literally received the fireplaces THE NEXT DAY via Fedex.</Review>

This week I contacted Starfire Direct and was in contact with Tricia. I needed to find a solution to put my burner pan that I bought last summer in since I couldn't get a contractor to build me a custom pit in my area. She found a Fire table where we could order just the vessel for me and sent me a catalog with our color options. To be sure I got the right colors, I asked for an actual photo of the vessel and she sent me a picture of all 3 colors I wanted in a side by side photo taken outside so that it would show the actual colors. I got on the phone today to place that order with her and asked her a couple more questions about my gas line and she quickly called over to the manufacturer of the vessel and got a response on how to make it work. I am very pleased with her fast response times and getting me the details to solve my problem and get me a vessel for my firepit! I look forward to having it arrive. Thank you!< /Review>

Hi Jonathan,

I just want you to personally know how wonderfully impressed we are with the gas fire pit. This thing is substantial and gorgeous. I am so very happy with our purchase and the wait was well worth it.

The boxes came undamaged and yet we still held our breath. We expected to see a missing part, crack or scratch and there was none!

This fire pit is massive and the quality is incredible. I am already considering ordering another one for our pool house remodel. Thank you for the sparkle rocks too, the extra bling really compliments the black table.

Thank you for the wine and even calling us to personally apologize about the delay. Doing business in this pandemic is hard on all businesses but you took the extra effort to call and that was so nice.

Along with the fire pit, the cover was supposed to be included. We did not receive the cover and I hope the manufacturer can send one to us. For now I will protect it with a tablecloth.

Thank you again,

Jennifer Lloyd< /Review>

<Review>I purchased the wine barrel fire pit on 3 October 2020 and it arrived on 16 December 2020. I was told it would be delayed due to fires in California where the product is produced and I was okay with that. I actually liked the looks of the product based on what I saw on-line and felt good about supporting a business affected by the fires. I was very disappointed to find that the product finally arrived without the cover, which we need to protect it from the sun and rain. I followed-up and found that the cover is on backorder. How is it possible that the cover was never ordered in the 2.5 months it took to produce and ship the product!?! I was told on 23 December that the cover would ship in two weeks by ground transportation. I asked if they would ship next day and received no reply. It is now 5 February 2021 and no cover and the fire pit is still sitting in my garage, despite Tricia promising that the cover would ship to me on 19 January. Very disappointing customer service!<//Review>< response>

<Review>Once you connect with the people at Starfire Direct you will find that you no longer have to investigate other companies. Their customer service is second to none. They not only have the knowledge and tools to provide you with what you want, but more importantly, they have the desire to please you.  We have been dealing with Starfire for the last number of years on a number of occasions and have never been disappointed.
They have serviced us even though we live in Bend, OR some 904 miles away.  Love these guys. Do yourself a favor...ask for Tricia or Sasha!!<//Review>< pictures>

It was expensive, took forever to arrive, and upon opening the box we were immediately disappointed and called to request a full refund and return. They refuse full refunds and charge shipping and a restocking fees which ends up being over half of the absurd price they charge to begin with. I've never been this upset with a purchase in my life. They did not send the return label for over a week and a half! Never again... I wish I didn't lose my money to this company that doesn't provide any customer service and is only out to charge their customers ridiculous prices for fire glass that you can get off Amazon way faster, for better quality, and at a much more reasonable price. Don't waste your time, money, or energy on dealing with Starfire Direct.<//Text></record>

I ordered 2 water and fire bowls in December 2020. They had mentioned I would have them by Jan 21 lastest due to Covid 19.  Then I get an email saying my bowls were on their way but they were delayed for a week.  Its February and nothing then they said 2 more weeks at this point my contractor and my wife are giving me pressure but I'm stuck with this people because any were elese its 5 weeks away. They promised Feb 21st I would get it and still nothing.  They said someone had broken in their warehouse in Mexico that they were another month out. This company is a joke. I have to reorder somewhere else and wait 5 weeks. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!Beware< /Review>

I would like to recognize the exceptional customer service I received from Tricia. Our initial interaction was via web chat, and then on the phone for our final questions and purchase. We purchased your 60" Cono Moreno Copper Fire Pit, as well as additional 1/4 inch glass for our 2 fire bowls, which we received last week. Tricia is courteous, very friendly, knowledgeable, and professional. We have been through an inside home remodel and now a huge outside pool project, so having good customer service is not always common, as I'm sure you know. It was very refreshing to have worked with Tricia. This was a big purchase for us, not only monetarily, but also trusting that we would be satisfied in the end. Tricia was able to answer my many questions, and made us feel comfortable throughout the process.  She is definitely the reason we went through with purchasing this fire pit.

Thank you for taking the time to read this email. We own our own business, and employees like Tricia are an asset.  I hope she is recognized in some way because she deserves it!  We will definitely use Starfire again in the future and will refer you on to anyone we know!

I can’t say enough great things about Ady and Mitchell. They helped us through a situation with a fire pit that I never thought would be resolved in a positive way. He stayed calm when I got a bit nutty. He returned my calls and emails  and was attentive to  and understanding of our needs.
It was a pleasure to work with your company. We will order again without hesitation. The pyromania fire pit is beautiful !< /review>

Was a little skeptical about ordering an expensive fire pit online and having it shipped via truck. It was shipped to survive. They used extra heavy-duty cardboard and a 2x4 pallet. It arrived in perfect condition! Very happy with the purchase.< /text>

<Text>I recently purchased a Real Fyre Vented Charred Oak Gas Log for my wife for Christmas. I worked with Steven Kinsey, my sales rep who was very good about asking several questions about what my fireplace looked like, along with asking me questions about the dimensions I was working with. This is a great investment, and the folks at Starfire Direct were great. Although you can't get in the showroom right now, they give you various options to look at and decide on the product you want. I ordered one day and picked it up the next. I was able to install it myself, and that says a lot because I am terrible as a handyman. I can barely change a lightbulb. Excellent choice for a Christmas present or maybe for Valentine's Day. My next project will be one of their outdoor firepits.< /Text>< date>

Easy ordering , however " in stock "suggests they have the product which is not true , also the ships in 10 days is "business days"  they didn't  ship mine  for 16 business days and a/o today have not  seen delivery . Fedex say's Thursday  but it's still in CA . Highly probable it will be nearly 3.5 weeks till delivery.< /review>

< Review>
I ordered a natural gas fire pit from Starfire direct. The order was back ordered for over a month but we were still fully charged at time of order despite having to wait over a month. I had to call multiple times after the item was in stock before they would ship.

Our Avalon fire pit finally arrived and was  aesthetically pleasing but the heat output was poor relative to the rated BTUs. Our gas line was installed by a certified gas technician who re verified the gas flow was adequate up to 230K BTUs. I contacted Starfire who said they could not accept a return and there was nothing else they could do for us. We have sat around numerous other natural gas fire pits that put off significantly more heat than the Avalon fire pit by Pyromania (rated up to 60K BTUs).

I will not buy another fire pit from Starfire direct or Pyromania.</Review>

{'time': 1603466532717, 'text': 'Clark, thank you for taking the time to leave this review. As discussed with you over the phone and via email, the Avalon fire pit you purchased is rated for up to 60,000 BTUs. So, though your gas line has a higher rating, the fire pit itself is not able to reach anything higher than the advertised 60k BTUs. Unfortunately, PyroMania does not accept returns on used items, which is also noted on the listing. Again, we apologize for the inconvenience, but we are unable to process a return for a used item.'}< /Response>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1605572929108, 'text': "Hi Doug,\n\nThanks for your review.  We realize this item was delayed.  Our website says 4-5 weeks but yours took much longer.  This item was shipped directly from our supplier and they were out of many components that allowed them to complete your order sooner.\n\nWe realize this is a big inconvenience and apologize for this.  We also realize we could do better at communicating.  With the huge surge of orders this year, we found it difficult to reach out to our customers at the same level as in years past.  But we're aware of our shortcomings and are diligently working on improving our processes.\n\nThe email we sent after replying to your review is an auto generated email asking if our response or solution was adequate to encourage a better review.  After all, the goal of the review system is to help us communicate with our customers and provide solutions to problems.  If you feel we deserve a low rating even after we explained the circumstances surrounding your order, that is your right and we respect that.\n\nWe do appreciate your business and hope your HPC drop in burner pan works very well for your fire pit.   Having installed these for years, I can say you bought a very good burner despite the longer lead times.\n\nCheers!\n\nStarfire Direct"}</response>< GmapID>

Hello.  I am writing to let you know that I just received the best service and help from Luke.  He walked me through the entire ordering process and advised me on what to order.  He looked at my photos and sent photos from the showroom.  He was incredibly knowledgeable, patient, kind and helpful.  I spent over $1000 and still feel that I got a good deal because he steered me to a less expensive model.  Luke is a huge asset to your team.  He is a great representative for Starfire Direct<//text>

Starfire Direct provides World Class customer service.  The level of product knowledge is amazing with safety at the top of the list.  Mitchell Metcalf is my representative, he took the time to make sure I understood ANSI and how important it is to adhere to the industry standards.  He spent the time to find the perfect gas log system for my home.  I appreciate the relationship I have as a repeat customer with Starfire Direct.  Great company, amazing staff!

Thank you,

My experience with Starfire was excellent.  Luke was my sales associate.  He assisted me from start to finish in a professional manner.  It was clear that he is very knowledgeable and capable of assisting his customers in his line of business.  He provided options that fit my needs, gave me follow up resources and closed the deal.  Thank you Starfire. Thank you Luke.</text>

<review>First I’d like to say how important your YouTube informational videos are.  At best before watching it I would probably have just ended up with the StarFire 24” fire ring.  But after watching it and thinking about down the road maintenance and possibly installing an electric starter I went with the fire pan and the fire ring that screws to the sides of the fire pit.  I put the order in last week after visiting with Mitchell.  He did a great job of explaining different items, thanks again to Mitchell.  I hope to have the fire ring, pan and side brackets install in a few days.  At that point I’ll post a couple of pictures.<//review>< Pictures>

I'm so impressed with this company and I don't even have the product yet.I inadvertently ordered mismatching parts for our DIY firepit, Rather than just stuffing it into a box and sending it to me anyway, customer service rep Sasha called me to inform me, I called back and Steven walked me through my order, what I needed and got me set up with the correct parts. Excellent customer service that you just don't see anymore. Keep up the great work , i  can't wait to get my order.<//Text>

<Text>I do not even know where to begin .....lets just say the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing in this company. Website leads consumers to believe product is in stock. Fire bowl I ordered description said IN STOCK and Ships in 3-4 weeks. Later, after several frustration phone calls they admit to me the website is wrong. Starfire Direct does not have the item at all. They get them from somewhere else and shipping is delayed due to Covid-19 pandemic. If they would have just been honest with me I would have understood. So after waiting 7 weeks, being told it was the manufacturers fault, and therefore essentially no assistance from Starfire Direct,  I called the manufacturer myself (googled the phone number because Starfire Direct would not provide me the manufacturer's number)  and the manufacturer's (Prism) customer service was Outstanding.  Prism arranged shipping and I received my fire bowl in 3 business days. Prism arranged for me to get a beautiful fire bowl and there were no Covid-19 pandemic shipping delays.
Avoid Starfire Direct unless you want zero customer service and loads of frustration.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1593114272069, 'text': 'Cynthia,\n\nThank you for letting us know about your experience.  We apologize for the delays surrounding your order.  As you mentioned, we do receive this particular item from Prism and we have zero control as to the lead time.  When you placed your order, they were telling us that these items were taking 3-4 weeks to make, so that\'s what we relayed on our website.  In actuality, all Prism orders are taking closer to 6-8 weeks to deliver.  Our industry has seen a huge surge in orders since customers being home during COVID, thus delaying orders and creating inventory shortages.  High demand and low supply is a recipe for upset customers.  To help with this and be more transparent, we\'ve recently updated our site to reflect this by changing the phrasing from "In Stock" to "Special Order".  I agree that this could\'ve been more clear prior to making your purchase and apologize for the frustration.\n\nWe are actively making improvements to our site every day and take feedback from our customers seriously.  Thank you for sharing your review and we hope you enjoy your new fire pit.\n\nJonathan Burlingham\nCEO\nStarfire Direct'}<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<Resp>{'time': 1589261206883, 'text': "Mr. Belcher,\n\nPlease accept our apologies for your delayed order.  When you originally placed your order for this fire pit on 4/25/20, we were told by this particular manufacturer that new orders would be shipping in 7-10 business days.  Thus, we gave this lead time to you and also other customers that purchased this same item.  However, with supply chain delays, a reduced labor force, and shelter in place mandates affecting our entire country, this item and many like it have been delayed.  This was 100% out of our control.  Having realized that these lead times were not happening, we updated the status on our website and have been reaching out to our customers to let them know about the delays to see if they want to change or cancel their orders.\n\nI see that your order has already been canceled and refunded.  I'm sorry that we were unable to meet our original deadline and that your experience with us was terrible.  We really do work hard to take care of our customers and would never lie about lead times just to get your business.  We don't work like that.\nThese are certainly unpredictable times and we appreciate your understanding.  I hope you will consider us in the future for other backyard lifestyle needs.\n\nWishing you and your family good health and happy days!\n\nJonathan Burlingham\nCEO\nStarfire Direct"}< /Resp><Text>Don't believe the shipping times. I had a terrible experience with Starfire Direct. I ordered a product two weeks ago that they claimed was in stock and would ship in 5-7 days. I called a few days later and they said that the inventory was in stock and would ship a couple days later than expected. I called a week later and they said that I should expect shipment after another three weeks! Are you supposed to believe them the third time?

Their explanation for taking so long was higher than expected sales due to COVID-19. Congrats!  While these are uncertain times, all of this occurred weeks after the start of the pandemic and their competitors were transparent about slower fulfillment. They got my sale because they claimed to have the stock that others didn't, which was not true.<//Text>< time>

<review>They recommended me a product for my fireplace and I agreed. Unit is way too small. They don’t stand by their product nor the customer. You are a nobody. NO RETURNS.. even if it’s there fault. Think before you purchase a product from them.. YOU ARE A NOBODY TO THEM. It’s not cheap either. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY.. you are not a customer they only want your money.< /review>< username>

Shipped us a round firetable with a flat access panel. Took six months to fix. Same for another firetable we bought from them around the same time. Both were far more expensive for us to fix than the cost of the units.  One of the units was missing most parts too. Look out for what you buy. We were unimpressed to say the least.</Text>

< Review>
Stopped by the showroom over the weekend to ask a couple questions and ended up walking out with everything I needed to upgrade both my fireplace and my firepit.  Especially appreciated the knowledgeable staff (sorry, don't recall the woman's name) with practical knowledge as well as the DIY videos.  There was no pressure to buy anything but the prices were great.  I was able to finish both projects over the weekend and they turned out great!!!</Review>

We ordered several fire pits and some patio furniture just before Thanksgiving. We wanted to have them in time for the holiday and Starfire came through. Great quality and our family loved it. Great job.

<date>1561406327611</date><rate>1</rate><text>Direct to you -- goods that come from other manufacturers; Starfire Direct does not stand by their sales, but blame others for mistakes. After returning the umbrellas I was led to believe were manufactured in the USA or Canada(actually made in China), I only got a 77% refund due to steep restocking and shipping charges. I wrote to the CEO, who denied my refund request.  I believe this company and all online companies should be required to publish where the products are manufactured and assembled.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1561494431814, 'text': 'Hi Mr. Dougher,\n\nWe’ve had a chance to thoroughly investigate your case.  We started by looking at your online chat which simply said “Where are your umbrellas manufactured?  USA or China or ?”  to which our Customer Service Represented responded “…US and Canada, it depends on the brand”.  So, we did say that it “depends on the brand”, to which you didn’t follow up with any additional questions.  You never indicated the exact umbrella you were referring to.\n\nSo, in all fairness, you didn’t give us the opportunity to clearly define where the Galtech 737 umbrella specifically was made, which is why we did not accommodate your request to refund the restocking and shipping fees incurred on your order.\n\nPlus, when we first found out that you refused your shipment, we immediately reached out to the manufacturer and requested to have your restocking fee waived, but they declined.  This fee of $35.80 per umbrella was passed along to you, in addition to the FedEx round-trip shipping fee of $41, for a total of $112.60.  Had the manufacturer accepted the return without fee, we would’ve passed this savings on to you.\n\nPlease understand, these are the hard costs incurred and are in line with our return policy, which is listed on all of our Product Detail Pages in our Shipping & Returns section. As a small U.S. company, we unfortunately cannot afford to incur these expenses, as much as we’d love to. Hopefully as we grow, we’ll be able to be more accommodating with our return policy.'}<//Response><GmapID>0x80dc8200d24c0e55:0x86bae5091075e415<//GmapID></record>

I'm really happy with the customer service here. I wasn't sure what my options were for my fire pit and they walked me through all of the parts I would need and suggested a kit that would make it easier for me. The fire pit looks great and the brightly colored glass really sparkles. Love it!< /Review>

Bought from them twice, but never again. I found a local company and they checked and sure enough they charge OVER suggested manufacturer's price. They are just a middleman. I guess that how they pay for their "free freight."  The ceramic stones were only 20 lbs and it cost $289! So small and it would take $1200 worth to fill fireplace.  When I ordered I noticed they didn't say weight or coverage area which should have been my sign that I was not going to get my moneys worth. They too lost my order and it took 6 weeks and 3 phone calls to finally get them. They never sent me an invoice or update of shipping. I had to call each time and leave a message or email to get a call back. Kept saying they were backordered.  Seriously it's better to buy local so at least you can see what you are getting.<//text>

Excellent customer service! Despite originally having issues with my fire crystals, manager Lindsey was able to take a bad situation and make it right. He went out of his way and was very pleasant and reasonable to deal with while showing genuine concern for customer satisfaction. I would recommend Starfire Direct to anyone who wants to put a modern spin on their fireplace with their attractive selection of styles and colors.

Thank you Starfire Direct!< /text>

<review>Placed & paid for an order for a fireplace stand present for my family in early December, based on the product shipping "within 1-3 business days" per the website.  I called today on Christmas Eve to check on the order and they said that it was backordered "until January 20th we think".  No communication, no call/email heads up, nothing.  They made a point that they don't "guarantee anything on their website".  I wish I could give them zero stars but sadly it's not possible.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1546646306590, 'text': "Hi, we again apologize for the out of stock purchase and we’re sorry to hear about your bad experience.

Terrible experience. They simply ignore any of my attempts to return back their product. I have made 5 attempts to return their unopened box by calling them, chatting and submitting 2 Return Forms on their website. I didn't receive ANY response. I even submitted BBB complaint, and they don't bother to answer even that.
I once managed to speak to them over the phone and to my surprise they informed me that they will have to charge 20% restocking fee and also I will have to pay for shipment both ways. I said ok, just send me this information with instructions what to do. 3 weeks have passed since then and they haven't sent me anything.
I am glad I lost only $100 with them.< /review>

If you enjoy the outdoors and love a beautiful view, this place got you. The amphitheatre is located in beautiful surroundings and the wings are thoroughly done being realistic looking. It's blending into the rest of the nature so well. If you haven't been there yet and are around Hemet area, it's not even a question wether you should check it out.</Review>

Absolutely 5 stars for the beautiful scenery!! Wish I would have taken more pictures! The seating is made up of concrete with wooden backings, not the most comfortable but it wasn't completely terrible. Lots of restrooms available for use, bring a hat, sunblock, or other form of retreat from the sun on those beautiful sunny California days. They do have a snack bar available which is really nice and convenient.  Went to an actual play years ago here but just recently went for Easter Service so I can't remember if they have other vendors all the time or not, there were lots of booths set up at the entrance so seems like they may have regulars.< /Review>

I just moved to this area and for months had seen signs for Ramona. I had to know what this was about, other than how long it had been around, I didn't do too much homework.  It was EVERYTHING. The moment you get out of the parking lot it kinda has a renn faire feel, like you're going to be totally submerged in something cool. The entire thing is outdoors- bring sunscreen, a hat and maybe a coat or blankie. I haven't been here for a concert yet but it looks like there are cool packages. The actual Ramona show was stunning and I have no idea how they pull off the amazing sounds and wrangling a cast that big, and with so many kids. As an entertainer I was Blown Away.< /Review>

We attended Boo! At the Bowl. It was fun, but the games and bounce houses were a little more aimed at kindergarten aged kids and younger. Fun Halloween event.</text>

<text>Beautiful outdoor Amphitheater hidden in the Hills on the south end of Hemet. Plenty of parking and a wonderful view of the town. Very little shade so bring an umbrella with you...

<Review>Great show! I've actually performed in it in the past for 14 years straight. The cast is primarily made up of volunteers as well as the staff, the main cast is sometimes volunteers or paid. The view from the bowl is beautiful! The historical features all around the Ramona bowl are quite magnificent! You have to see it to appreciate it! They have various other shows throughout the year that support and are run by the community involvement. If you haven't been I do suggest checking it out! 😄</Review>< Pics>

<text>A wonderful mountain backdrop for the setting of a rancho.The love story portrays the CA frontier from the perspective of the Spanish and Native Americans after the Spanish American War.

I loved the horses, canon shot, Spanish costumes, dancing, mariachi, and Indian ceremony for the birth of a daughter.

It had a good bittersweet ending too. The show was even better than I anticipated!

I was hot in the sun but after intermission I was able to move to a shady vacant seat. Bring cash to purchase food.<//text>< Pictures>

We enjoyed the Ramona Pageant even though it was a bit hot early. it is crowded and fun and historic. Museum is fun and the docents  are friendly and knowledgeable . Getting from the parking lot is difficult. They give you a bus when you arrived but there is no bus when you leave. This made it difficult for some of the older people and people with disabilities. But I would definitely go again.< /Review>

Enjoyed the play very much, great seats, extremely nice greeters, ushers, museum folks.  Loved how gracious everyone was. The Bird Singers and all the folks with them were amazing, the hoop dancer was superb. Great experience.</Text>

Excellent Play. Wonderful hosts and an awesome environment.  Play truly gives you the  reality of actually being their in the story of Ramona. Definitely recommend bringing your entire family. It's a great historical story for everyone.<//Text>

<Review>Love the Bowl. I always enjoy the concert under the stars series. Prices are great and concession foods etc are also reasonably priced.  Would give five stars but the parking slots are ridiculously small. I tried to park in several of the available handicapped parking slots and couldn't fit!</Review>< Pictures>

Awesome place. The Ramona Pageant is a must see. Summer concerts are great. The playhouse always has something good going on. But I am also a little sentimental since I did fire watch for the pagent a lot of years, and also rented the bowl for my wedding. My wife and I were married standing in front of the mission church.<//Review>

Beautifully secluded in the mountains and the sound was nicely projected from the sound stage. Only downside was that the parking spots are barely wide enough to fit your car.< /Review>

Beautiful outdoor venue. Summers can be very warm to hot.  There is no shade. Wear a hat and sunscreen! Bring cushion to sit on. All is concrete bleacher style seating. Concession stand and gift shop.</Review>

Sat up in shade at the top on May 31. Great breeze,no sun,even had food close so we didn't have to walk far for food. I paid extra for my seat and would do it again. We had lots of room and sat in foldable chairs not cement benches with wood bouncy backs. My only complaint was that it was not handicap accessible unless you were in a wheel chair, steps everywhere and all uphill.<//Text>

The people that work here are awesome super nice made us feel welcomed. Come out and see the play dont forget your sun hat lol you will be sitting directly under the sun unless you pay 45 for boxed seats. Which is well worth it.restrooms are super clean means a lot lol.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Wow! What a nice interesting amphitheater.  If you want someplace new to go to, check this place out because it has easy parking, a gift shop and great views from the theater seating. The gift shop is also a mini-museum that has items dating back to the 1920's.  I was actually a performer there and I am excited to come back because the audience was so gracious!< /Text>

The place is cute in a touristy kind of way & makes for a great venue for events like graduations. Sitting lower & closer to the stage yeilds a more comfortable seat. In the upper seats, it's all concrete seating.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I truly enjoy this location and has ample seating the atmosphere makes you believe you are no longer in Hemet the view of the mountains r spectacular and the shows are really great I do wish they had better surround sound in the upper decks you can hear the music but because it's outside it tends to seems to be a little muffled at the top it's not as clear there's no acoustic walls to really bounce off of. The staff every time I've been there have seemed to be very polite and helpful.  😎</text>

this is the 2nd and the last time we will attend an event there dont know if the ushers are paid or not but we've been treated both times by very rude ushers my wife rode her mobility scooter to the center of the venue where it was marked for disable  and was told she couldn't park there I  believe her name was Betty we moved during the show she parked a Walker in the same spot and was in front of the light all night then we asked her for a companion seat real rude she replied I dont know anything about that disabled dont come by themselves they have companions who must sit next to them to make sure they dont fall our last event there we were treated by elderly rude ushers the only nice people were the ticket takers<//review>

Have gone to see three different productions here, really enjoy the local theatre group. The location is just beautiful! Tip: bring or rent cushions, the cement seats are hard as a rock</text>

We arrived as the place was being decorated for Halloween. There is a lot of community spirit here and was a wonderful walk about. The importance of this site, and why you should visit, is the setting for "Ramona" which, after being published, restarted in California a want to preserve the Missions, Presidios, and in general its history. You really feel that here and I highly recommend a visit, even if just to watch the play.< /Review>

<text>We have been to the Ramona Bowl  and loved it.  However my daughter is doing her first play through them vomited during practice, I left my phone and was at work the assistant director freaked out on my husband and son.  She really could use work on her personal skills.  My son tried to get into the theater and both doors were locked no one was in the two rooms they use for practice they were in the theater ( I know because i went into the two rooms when I left work to pick her up and no one was in there, if I would have had to walk through the actors practicing on the stage if I didn't go through the theater. )  My other son did get her and had been picking her up for us all week, yet she made a big deal and yelled at my husband and son saying she needed a parent or guardian. Never again will I pay for my family to be treated badly!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I've been to many plays!! Several of them have been out of doors. None can compare with the quality of this amazing performance at the Ramona Bowl in Hemet, California.  Ramona is the lead actress in the play which bears her name. The play is set in a remarkably beautiful natural ampitheater which must cover at least 30 or more acres. The audience of 600 occupies the seats on the south side of the ampitheater. The action of the play occurs in the valley and continues high up the hillside above the level of the audience.  The play is the longest running outdoor play in America. It has an international reputation, so people from many countries have attended the play.  Ramona is a MUST SEE event. I have attended eight times, and it never gets old.<//text>

< Review>
If you want a salesman that only has his pockets in mind, and could care absolutely less about your best interest, if you want to spend thousands in unnecessary warranty packages, have a higher interest rate than the bank or credit union would offer which means higher monthly payments and unnecessary down payments and thousands more in interest fees, if you would love to have gone through all of that and then receive a vehicle with open recalls (they will not mention to you) and then have your vehicle brake down before even making your first payment then Car Avenue is the right place for you. I WILL NEVER PATRONIZE THIS ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN IN THIS LIFETIME and would encourage anyone that will listen to do the same. They are dishonest and untrustworthy and they take advantage of those who don’t understand how the car business works.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED</Review>

I recommend Car Ave to everyone! They offer a great first time car buyer program and let me pick the car I wanted! They are reliable and quick with service. All the associates were friendly and approachable. They made the process easy and non stressful. Thank you Car Ave!</review>

Was able to purchase a vehicle but this place is definitely buyer beware... Looking like I'm gonna be stuck replacing two front wheel bearings on a vehicle I haven't even made a payment on yet. SMH stick to the big car lots if you can...</text>

<review>I want to give a shout out to Rudy and Romeo. They worked with me and made sure I received the vehicle I wanted at the price and down payment that I wanted. This is the 3rd vehicle I've purchased here and I havent had any problems with them nothing but great experiences at this dealership. I'll definitely be coming back.</review><username>Tyler Arias</username><Date>1615270703469</Date></record></dataset><record>

Didn’t think I was going to leave here with a 2019 Jeep Cherokee.  Guess what? I did, thanks to Tim,Raul and staff! Tim thanks for the hard work to make this happen, it means a lot.  Very happy with Car Ave.< /Review>

<Review>I just wanna say THANK YOU to Uriel and to Tim!! I went to Clawson Honda just to get a no call back with a crazy APR just because I was a first time buyer with poor credit. And these guys definitely made it happen with a reasonable down payment and low enough monthly car payment! Hands down best service I will be back in a year to get another car but for now I’m satisfied with how I was treated and how much they tried their best to work with me and my credit. I know my situation wasn’t easy but they didn’t give up and they kept trying. Thank you guys❤️< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80946758106e8ab9:0x8fadf1d90f7a778f<//Gmap_id>< pics>

Friendly and nice selection. A little more pricey than other stores but it's convenient. Parking is a bit hectic as it's a one way lot.</Review>

Clem's has a great selection of beer, wine, and liquor plus a delicious deli with quality sandwiches.  The staff is very friendly and will answer any questions you might have.  The beer selection varies from common to rare brews, including some beers from previous years (great for finding aged stouts).

The deli has a good selection and he quality is on point.  You can also take it next door to the tasting room they have, which was perfect.< /review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Amazing store. They have all kinds of fancy and harder to find beers, wines, liquor, ciders, etc. Cards listed around the store let you know which specific wines and beers have been highly rated in beer & wine magazines to help you pick a good one, and they give you a description of the flavor profile and\or company. Inside of the store is really nice, clean and relaxing. The staff is very helpful as well.</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80d9544967083a5f:0xfa317a835ec9ac27<//Gmap_id></record>

I can't believe that I have not been here sooner! Such a cool concept. There is a liquor store in the front, that has an amazing selection of craft beer and in the back of the parking lot is an extension of the liquor store that has multiple taps of really great beer, as well as a food menu. Tried a flight of some hard to find beers on tap, and also the Cubano pressed sandwich. Everything was great and considering the place was pretty slammed the solo server/beertender did a good job juggling it all.</Text>

Stopped in to pick up a very small bottle of tequila. Asked what they had that was under $20. Said I just needed something “very small
and cheap”.  The short, dark-haired heavy-set man at the counter took a quick look and said “the cheapest bottle of tequila we have is $29.” I said “really?” in surprise. I told him I never buy tequila but was surprised that that was the cheapest bottle they had. I said “ok, thanks anyway, I think I’ll pass” and started to head for the door. He said “wait, here’s one for less”. I watched as he pulled a very small bottle off the front of the shelf, grab a bigger bottle behind it, and then put the small bottle back on the shelf. He said, presenting the bigger bottle to me: “this one is $18.” I was surprised, not at the difference in price between that and the one he originally said was the cheapest at $29, but that he tried telling me that this new bottle was the cheapest, when I just saw him handle the *exact same tequila* in a smaller size. I said “what’s that small bottle right there. How much is that?” Pointing at the one he just pulled off the shelf and put back. He said $15. I said “I’ll take that one.” Let me just say that I was NOT happy. I really (*really*) do not appreciate being taken advantage of. Maybe he thought I was stupid because I’m a woman? Or that I wasn’t observant enough to notice what he was doing? Or that I’m such an idiot I would believe that you can’t get tequila there for under $30? No idea, but this one experience was bad enough that it’s unlikely I’ll shop there again, even though I’m in the area all the time. Here’s a tip: be honest with your customers, don’t try and swindle them, be friendly and helpful, and they’ll sing your praises and won’t leave (well-deserved) two star reviews on Google.</text>

<Text>This bottle shop features one of the best selections of beer around, particularly for European offerings.  I often find myself on the hunt for classic examples of European beer styles that aren't particularly common in these parts, and Clem's is pretty consistently the most likely to deliver.  Freshness can sometimes be an issue, as many of the bottles are warm-stored and some of the beers probably don't turn over very quickly, and it would be nice if the beers were a bit better organized, which would help make them easier to find.  The owner Paul is very responsive to customer feedback, though, and is working on improving these things.  All in all, this shop is a good option, especially if you're looking for a beer you can't find elsewhere in town.<//Text><Date>1547235484471</Date><UserId.>113529657232686012380< /UserId.><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

Guy who was working was on his phone the whole time we were there, couldn't tell us if they carried any Russian River Brewery beer, and just kept directing us over to the refrigerated beer section. Hope it's just one bad employee, but will be looking for somewhere else to purchase my beer, too.</text>

Amazing selection of craft beer as well as beer from all over the country. Unrivaled selection of bottles and cans anywhere, as well as multiple coolers of cold beer and wine. So many great vintages and harder to find releases available right off the shelf. Friendly staff and a great convenient location. Check our their bar next door for a great selection on draft.< /review>

Let me start off by saying, the lady who makes the sandwiches is the sweetest, I love her very much, and her sandwiches are extraordinary. The guy who I assume is the owner, was on a call ordering booze for his store; fair, but he wouldn’t get off the phone call, and proceeded to check me out. Not only was he distracted, my card kept getting declined, even though I had the funds in there! It was really frustrating, because obviously all he had to do was tell the guy on the phone, ‘let me call you right back, I have a customer right here.’ We tried it a second time, with another card, and was declined yet again. He told me to go next-door to the ATM. I just left because he was rude. I’m sorry to the sweet sandwich-making lady, and my abandoned lunch.<//Review>

An amazing sandwich shop and liquor store, Clem' s has a huge selection of beer, wine and liquor, and makes some of the best sandwiches around. I recommend the Gobbler if you enjoy a hot sandwich. Staff is always friendly, and the owner Wally has been in business for 35 years. A treasure in Kensington.</text>

Well organized, prices are on the higher end for beer, they do hide Pliny in the back and you have to ask for it. Better than Bottlecraft and they have a tasting room with an outdoor patio in the back.

If you are looking for some wine finds, this is a great place to come. You can find some stuff that you won't find elsewhere,  but you'll pay a premium for it. They have a large selection of French and other foreign wines as well as California wines. A large sake selection too plus lots of liquors and beer<//review>

<userid>108685370139018629938<//userid><Review>Clem's Bottle House has a lunch counter featuring sandwiches made with Boar's Head deli meats and cheeses nestled inside a liquor store in Kensington on Adams Avenue.

Clem's fresh hot sandwiches are made to order and are of consistently fine quality regardless of who is preparing them. My favorite is probably the "Egg Salad," which is of the creamy and chunky variety on toasted rye bread, with lettuce and pepperjack cheese. Be forewarned, however, that they do tend to annoyingly run out of egg salad by early afternoon on the weekends. The egg salad has a touch of sweetness, but will mostly be savored for its bright, fresh flavors.

When I don't order the Egg Salad, I order the "Sledgehammer." This sandwich is not just a pretty name, it also delivers the goods with hot ham, bacon, and cheddar cheese on an onion roll or french roll. I recommend having it with the onion roll, lettuce, onions, pepperoncini, mayo, and mustard. The Sledgehammer is a well put-together sandwich that is as filling and tasty as it sounds.

All sandwiches come with a pickle spear on the side. There is no seating inside the store, though there are four small tables outside.<//Review>< Rating>

<Text>3.5 stars. Great beer selection and on-shelf rating cards, but too many of their beers are over $12 a bottle and the don't appear to offer volume discounts. Also, some of their beers are also old. I bought a beer from BrewDog that was bottled a year ago.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1480950300352, 'text': 'Hi Rick,\n\nThanks so much for the review!  We actually just began offering 10% off any 6 bottles or more of beer, wine and spirits.  Also,  was the beer from brewdog bad?  If you are ever unsatisfied with a product we are happy to swap it or refund you.  Thanks again and we hope you will revisit Clems and your review soon.\n\nCheers!'}< /response><gmap_id>0x80d9544967083a5f:0xfa317a835ec9ac27</gmap_id></record>

I had a idea for modifying the exhaust on my 2014 Rubicon but I was not sure how it would turn out. I walked in without an appointment and 20 minutes later my Jeep was up on the rack and they were already working on it.
I went with their suggestions for removing my muffler and adding a resonator.
I turned out better than I expected! Two hours later I drove out with a smile. They were very professional, did a great job and I am very pleased with the outcome.< /Text>

Had catalytic converter, muffler and exhaust pipe replaced on 98 Jeep Wrangler. Quality of work was high. Marlon was very helpful in making suggestions for the exhaust system. I have since told two friends about WTB and they too were satisfied with the work done on their cars.</text>

When nothing what the best will do, come see Marlon and the boys. I've been bringing all of my cars, including my Saleen XP8 here for almost 15 years! Come here if you want high quality exhaust work done by a family run business who stand by their work, I won't ever go anywhere else!< /Review>

First time customer, called on the phone urgently needing some exhaust work. They were able to squeeze me in first thing in the morning the following day. I had raised my car and had issues with suspension components hitting the exhaust in multiple areas. They ended up having to re pipe the entirety of the exhaust from a couple feet in front of the differential to the back of the bumper. No more contact under full droop and compression! Really clean welds and craftsmanship, not to mention they had the car back to me in a couple hours and had no more issues. Highly recommended!<//text>

Marlon and his crew went the extra mile when the "bolt on" exhaust kit I bought for my truck had some fitment issues.  They want the extra mile, worked harder and longer and made the necessary modifications.  Did all of the above and did not charge additional labor!   Now that's a business that warrants new customers! They are my new muffler shop for all of my vehicles!</text>

Had a broken exhaust pipe  at the muffler on my 99 Hyundai Elantra. I work on my car every once in a while and researched the fix for this  online. It required welding etc and therefore decided to outsource this.  Found this place thru google as it had 5 star reviewers. The owner ( Marlon) took a quick look and very much concurred with what I had researched  without adding any unnecessary and expensive  up sells. He quoted a reasonable price and   Finished the job in 30 minutes. Very happy with the overall experience. This place is honest, fair priced and quick. 5 stars from my side as well.<//Review>

This is the first time I met Marlon. He is a very nice person. I literally took my Civic with a hanging muffler. Honda Service center gave me an estimate for 3000 dollars for fixing the muffler. I brought it to this place. Told him I am planning to sell the vehicle soon and want this repaired so that it wont be too costly to me. He gave me two options 1. replacing the whole thing. The cost is no where near 3000 2. To fix it in a way that I can have it working for at least until my catalytic converter give up. He did a very decent job for 250. My car sounds like a new car with no sound at all. Very nice job. Totally satisfied with the way he did the job. He is a very nice person too. Definitely recommend this to anyone. I am glad I came to know about this shop.<//Text>

<Review>Went in on a Saturday to get a chrome exhaust tip installed. There was no wait whatsoever and Dan helped me right when I walked in. The price was more than fair, Dan was knowledgeable and skillful. He made sure I was getting exactly what I wanted and provided some tips along the way. The shop reminds me of something I would find back home. Humble, fair, friendly, fast, and competent. Highly recommend.</Review>< rate>

Dan is very helpful and knowledgeable in how he fixed the muffler on the BMW. Where I thought the fix would be a bit expensive, he kept it at a reasonable and fair rate and also completed it in a acceptable amount of time. He was very meticulous in what he did and I and my friend are very appreciative of his work.< /Review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>I know just enough about cars to be dangerous. I brought my car to WTB thinking it needed a new flex pipe in the exhaust system as I could see the old one was shredded and thought it was giving me an exhaust leak and throwing an engine code. WTB took a look and confirmed that the flex pipe was shredded, but not yet leaking and wasn't the cause of my code. In my years of car ownership I've caught two shops trying to cheat me with unneeded repairs. I reported them to the local inspector. It's only fair that when I run across an honest shop I make sure to report them to everyone else. WTB didn't work on my car because they were honest enough to tell me I didn't need it yet.

<Review>Operated by owner himself, A trustful go to place for Muffler problem,  the price is very attractive and the workmanship has quality,  my 2003 Toyota Corolla's Muffler pipe fall apart,  he soldered it for me for $50,  so far so good,  I did have one small problem with appointment -- Dropped by first time with appointment but told come back later,  but considering that it is one man operation and the price and quality of the work, no issue for me.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Walked in on a Saturday not expecting to get the actual work done, thinking I'd have to schedule something later in the week. They got me right in for a resonator delete on my Focus ST. Only 70 bucks and a half hour of my day! Friendly shop guys,  good price, and great work! Can't beat it!< /review>< username>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>While in LA, my car hit a piece of metal debris on I-5.  It caused a nickel size hole in the exhaust pipe.  Ford wanted $735.00 for the entire system - only way they would replace the damage.  WTB was referred to me by another shop.  They said they'd do a great job for a super price.  BINGO!  So right they are.  I arrived at WTB Mufflers early Friday.  Dan heard my description, took the car to the rack, confirmed the problem, quoted a super price, and repaired it within 30 minutes.  Friendly, professional, super reasonable.  Thank you WTB Mufflers.< /Text><userid>106770018887088571213<//userid>< gmap_id>

Came in to straight pipe my resonator, good price, & he let me watch him do all the work and also made a couple suggestions but didnt push me to do anything i didnt want. Whole deal only took 45 minutes and i love the new sound i have! These guys know what they are doing, would definitely recommend to friends! :)</Text>

<Text>This place is awesome! Definitely recommend Marlon and the crew.  Worked me right in and I was out of there in 25 mins. They welded my exhaust of my mercedes AMG and fixed the bracket for a fraction of what another shop wanted. Trust me..call these guys. They are good peeps!< /Text>< date>

<Review>First off I am a 28 year old woman with little to no knowledge of cars...I recently took my 2014 Chevy Cruz to WTB Mufflers because of loud metal on metal grinding sound that was coming from the front right wheel well. I was astonished to find out I had warn the front right break down to negative nothing, damaging the rotor beyond repair. These guys took the time to explain how this was done, several options for repair and ultimately encourage me to contact my dealer to have the car, that is still under warranty, fixed by Chevy. I must have taken up at least 2 hours of their time and ultimately did not have the work completed by them but the knowledge I gained and the confidence to approach the dealer was priceless. Frank has been working on my mother's car for two years now and she refuses to see any one else as will I. Thank you Guys for your time and all the great advise. I will be back!<//Review>< Date>

I picked WTB for muffler repair work on my car based on all the positive reviews I read online. And I had the same experience those others had - fast, friendly, affordable service. The repairman showed me the location of the problem and provided options with pricing for the repair. He also pointed out a flange that is ok for now but likely to need replacement "within the next two years" due to salt corrosion from my years living in the Midwest. And again offered the option / price for replacing it now or waiting until later. When they pulled the car around after the repair I didn't even hear it, it was so quiet - even though it sounded like a boat before. And they gave me a great price. It is SO great to find an honest, knowledgeable repair professional in any profession. I highly recommend WTB mufflers.</Review>

Needed some custom exhaust work on a vehicle with an engine conversion.  One shop on Poway road by the car dealers essentially told me to find my own parts and they'd install them.

This place called around, found parts, even ordered a few different sets to make sure they had the correct one to get my truck done quickly.  Good shop and a good place to take custom work where out-of-the-box thinking is required.</Text>

<text>These guys know what they're doing. I had my wife's ST get a new 3 inch and my Camaro SS. Very happy with the installation quality as well as the speedy Ness of the job. They don't mess around here.

Update: I just got my project mustang exhaust done and man am I impressed with their work. 5 stars!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

I made an appointment for Tuesday at 10:00 am and when I got there the salon was closed. I called 3 times and no one answered, I even waited 30 minutes and no one answered. When I called the day before to make the appointment they said that 10:00am was a good time to come in but clearly it wasn’t. If they are not going to be in the salon by the time of the appointment they should’ve let me know. This was a complete waste of time and I would recommend to take your business elsewhere if you’re looking for a salon with actual professionalism.< /Text>

<Review>First time here and I’m so happy. I was nervous at first bc this was the first time I was getting a specific cut, but I showed Leo some sample photos of what I wanted and he did it perfectly. They’re super nice and I can’t wait to go back:) Would highly recommend!<//Review>< Pics>

I got to say that the haircut I received here is one of the best haircuts I have ever gotten! The hair stylist put in a lot of effort providing excellent quality with attention to detail. Not only did I receive a great haircut, but the customer service was just as good. I highly recommend coming here if you want an A+ quality haircut! Trust me you wont be disappointed! 😀< /Review>

Run the other way.  Got my haircut from Joana, she literally took 10 minutes and it was totally uneven when I rechecked it in the car.  I called her back to fix and and she never returned my call.  Definitely not going back.  Thanks to her I have to pay for another haircut tomorrow.</review>

< Review>
Never experienced such a thing! Called early this morning and spoke to a guy who worked there (my mistake not asking what his name was) asked if they had any availability for two people today and he said sure to come in at 11:30am. When we arrived we told the two other guys there, that we spoke to someone and he told us to come in at that time, in which they responded if we knew the guys name. They believe it was a guy who was there earlier (maybe the owner?) this lady turns around and says to just have a seat and we’ll get to you. One of the guys Caramelo (really nice) walks over and asks who wants to go first, so I tell my mom to go ahead. I then sit there waiting 2 hours because the lady was doing someone else’s hair and would get to me when she finished (so they said). After a while we asked again when they would get to me and he said once she finished. She then walked over to him and they whispered something to each other and she went back to her client (weird much). Finally the lady finishes with her client, I’m still waiting and then everyone who was working and had clients but we’re now gone, just took a break in the back, which I thought okay I understand she just finished with a client she needs a break, no... she sat down and started doing her OWN hair. My mother asked Caramelo “I thought she was doing my daughters hair?” To which he responded, “she’s not really working today and this other guy has his appointment...”  What?! Really? Why wouldn’t anyone say that to me after 3 hours of sitting there? So I stood up and told my mom I’d come pick her up when she was done because I was tired of sitting there. I’m sure they do wonderful work but that was so unprofessional, if people are told to come in they expect to get their hair done... The lack of communication and the carelessness is beyond me, they should learn to communicate better and hopefully find their manners along the way.</Review>

<review>I really like this place.  You can always count on an excellent cut regardless of any staff member, you will get the same excellent cut.  I used to go to other fancy barbershops amd they dont come close to IL Leone.  I never have to wait 45 minutes or even an hour to get seated eventhough i do not have an appt.  This is my new go to place to look fresh from here on out!!! I highly recommend you all try this hidden gem!<//review>< username>

<username>BRIAN YAVA<//username><Review>If you want to be a part of an illegally run business, have unlicensed and uninsured stylists handle various cutting instruments around your head and face, be around an owner of a business that literally extorted the business from the previous owner by blackmailing and forcing the prior owner to hand over his part by cut-throat means that should have landed him in jail, if you want to be serviced by mostly illegal immigrants that dont speak even one word of English, "iLLeone" is the place for you. If you want professional licensed Cosmotologists with actual Morals and real kindness in their hearts that truly love servicing you and making you the most beautiful you can possibly be, then come visit the all new Hector's Salon #1 at 7548 Sepulveda Blvd. Van Nuys, CA 91405.
What Leo? You might think we just don't care anymore about what you did and everything is over with but trust me buddy,  will never forget! The owner of Il Leone is a real scumbag that took advantage of a kind man that was his friend for more than 15 years. After he blackmailed Hector, which by the way was in business at this location for more than 20 years, and extorted Hector into giving up his half of the Salon (Hector's Salon) he kicked dirt on an already defeated man that literally helped the new owner Leo when he was and had nothing. Leo is a scumbag and ILLeone is a business built on the shoulders of Hector's Salon. Without all of Hector's efforts and the blood, sweat, and long hours that he put into building that business, iLLeone would not even be a thought in this scumbag's head. Him and his boytoy Oscar had the oddasity to beat up Hector when I wasnt around as that is not even the worst of it, Leo and Oscar stole the business phone number and all of Hectors clients by illegaly forging his name and logged into Hector's private email account to send an email asking the phone company to switch the ownership of the phone number to Leo, the new owner. Tell me, what type of person does that after someone gives them a chance to be the owner of an established business for dirt cheap?
That's right! A real live and 100 percent authentic scumbag! If you want to be a part of such crooked and gangster ways to run a business then you will be right at home at iLLeone! Hopefully State Board or ICE agents don't show up again and yank ur stylist away while they are in the middle of doing your hair!< /Review><user>118200197212440471522<//user>< gmap_id>

Great service, amazing atmosphere, and a pretty good vibe all around. Really the whole location is cool, if you’re looking for a studio I highly recommend man, D is a fire engineer sincerely. I’m not one to write reviews but I gotta give it up in this one! Check out Millennial sound 💯💯< /Review>

I’ve worked with D a handful of times the past two months. He’s a great partner and adjusts easily when we change direction throughout the session. I’d recommend D among any other studios I know locally. Thanks D, appreciate your flexibility and support!<//Text>

<text>I had a good experience at the actual studio but afterwards it was a mess. It is very hard to get in contact with somebody, as in an actual person, most of the e-mails seem like automatically generated e-mails and no one ever actually answers the phones. Based on my experience they're not very good at mixing singing vocals and I have been trying for over a week to pay for extra editing because i was not satisfied with the first few attempts,but their pay portal on their website is not functioning correctly and they refuse to believe that the issue was on their end. No one was rude or technically unprofessional, they just make it very hard to communicate and get the results you want for your music. Very disappointing, i was hoping to be able to use this studio regularly but it is very much a hastle doing business with them. I do not recommend.< /text>< resp>

<Text>D" was the engineer for my two sessions with him. He's an excellent engineer, and I don't hesitate in recommending him: he's engineered rock, country, hip hop, and bluegrass. We worked well together, and he's more than willing to work with his customers. As a songwriter, it's important for me to get the best sound for my demos that's possible - this studio delivers!</Text><name>Anthony Griffin< /name>< Resp>

Booth looked excellent and the music when mixed and mastered; sounded crisp and clear. I recommend this spot to anyone serious about their music. The Engineer himself has been doing music and Engineering for many years; he is very knowledgeable of his occupation.<//review>< pics>

This is Millennial Sound\n\nFor someone who has never booked a session with us to leave a 1 star review because of them not being able to have a studio tour is absolutely amazing. First you lied, We told you a $30 deposit needs to be made in order to book a session with us before 9pm. If you where unhappy with how we handle new artist you should have gone to another studio. If you've been in the music industry as long as you say you have, you would know a deposit at a professional established studio is mandatory. We do not let any random person off the street who calls in our studio in to view. There are videos and pictures online along with our equipment listed.

< Review>
You sell fake product from downtown and sell it at your shop for a profit. I get it... but don’t lie to customers and say it’s the real product when it’s the knock off. RAW cones are not packed with plastic separator sticks. The real RAW cones come with cardboard sticks. I smoke daily and usually don’t go to shops like this unless I truly need to. I called and asked if they are real RAW cones and you lied to me and said yes the are legit. The paper is not raw paper and the cones are not even raw cones either... why don’t you go on line and check out the owner of RAW And see how dedicated he is to his product.

<Text>Went in to look for a new vape and Tom aka “Cream” was so helpful with what kind of juice I should get and which vape was good. Also gave me a brief background about the CBC oil that are usable with Vapes. I recommend this store. Great customer service!!!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I've personally purchased two beaker waterpipes and multiple bowl pieces here, love it every time and the service/staff is rad. My friends also have been super happy with their purchases and we definitely plan to keep going here whenever we need glass, so it's also good for that on top of their vape selection and all<//text>

<Text>I have been seeing Dr. MacGregor for over ten years and he is very thorough with doing a full skin check.  He has really good bedside manners and listens very well.  I'm glad to have him as my dermatologist!  The new office is so bright and has a nice view of the bay.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.< /Text>< userid>

<Review>I go to dermatologists every year because of years of sun exposure and high risk of skin cancer. Dr. MacGregor is by far the most thorough dermatologist that I have seen. He is very friendly, communicates clearly, takes the time to listen and answer questions. I also feel he is honest as far as cosmetic procedures and what works best for the patient. I can tell he takes a lot of pride in his work. Did I mention how clean, bright and beautiful the office and exam rooms are? That’s a plus too! His staff is very courteous also. I highly recommend Dr. MacGregor!< /Review>< username>

I must met Dr. MacGregor for the first time. I felt his exam was thorough and complete, in his questions, recommendations and explanation. He took care to answer all my questions and I left feeling my issues would soon be resolved. It was both a pleasant and efficient visit. Great doctor/patient experience.<//text>

As always I encountered a friendly office staff who were able to work me in on short notice. Dr. MacGregor is very thorough in his examination and explains what he is doing as things proceed. His notes from previous session were thorough and he asked very appropriate questions about follow up. I recommend him most highly.</Text>

As always, Dr. MacGregor was very professional and prompt.  Most importantly, he is very knowledgable.  I travel a long distance to see him, but  it's worth it because I trust him completely. The rest of the staff in the office are great, also.</Review>

<Text>Today was my first visit to Dr. MacGregor regarding some allergies. The staff was great, the office was super clean, and Dr. MacGregor is mind-blowing. He was in no hurry and asked several questions related to my issues. He empathized, he is very knowledgeable, he subscribed me the required meds and gave me suggestions on what I can do to prevent this happen in the future...and did I mention about the view from the office?< /Text>< Pics>

I seemed to have a different experience here than most people. I was talked down to in a condescending way by the office manager and was being sold on too many for-profit products. Also, their office should keep a nurse in the room during full body checks. Didn't feel comfortable. Just a thought!< /Review>

Dr. MacGregor is highly skilled and has light hands. My recent skin biopsy was over before I knew it happened, and Dr. MacGregor called me as soon as the results were in to reassure me that all was well. I really appreciated his courtesy in doing so.  I've been seeing him and his very helpful physician assistant, Christina Tucker, over the past few years for an annual checkup and for particular concerns. I've been very satisfied with the level of their work and highly recommend both. Their front desk staff are pleasant and helpful, too.< /Review>

< Review>
The office was light, airy and well-appointed.  I was greeted immediately when I entered.  I waited for only a few moments (no repetitive paperwork to fill out) and was then efficiently led to an office.  The doctor showed up almost immediately and was great.  He explained everything and did a small treatment.  I was out of there in about 20 minutes.  It was the best doctor visit I can remember.<//Review>

Christina Walker is fantastic. Always listens well, straightforward, had me in and out in ten minutes for my specific needs.

They changed offices to allow for more space in COVID-19 times and there’s an air purifier in each patient room to maintain as clean an environment as possible.

Thank you team :)</Text>

Dr MacGregor is very smart, knowledgeable, efficient  and careful. He is really a “pro”.
He sees things others miss. Though I wish  he had more time to discuss some of the issues, he is rightly in demand. I’m happy to have him as my Dermitologist</review>

The office is very careful to comply with Covid safety requirements and standards before and during the visit. On a bigger picture, the office building located at 450 Sutter requires masks and distancing measures in the line before you enter the elevator. The elevator allows only 4 persons at a time with clearly set up markers that indicates where each person is to be positioned appropriately for social distancing. The office staff was thoughtful and careful in handling your insurance or credit cards. They supply you with sterile packets every time to wipe down your card after the staff "touches" a card. Of course the office itself is impeccable with not only both physical aesthetics and cleanliness, the medical service is top notch in San Francisco. So many of my friends and acquaintances will only visit this office for its excellent expertise.<//review>

I noticed a growth on an ear and called Dr. MacGregor’s office and was promptly given an appointment for the next day. The next day Dr. MacGregorr gave me a through exam and has begun  treatment of my situation. I am very happy of if the very competent professional care that I received in the past and present from Dr. MacGregorr and his staff.

<Date>1600544968329<//Date><Rate>5</Rate><review>Dr. MacGregor was very engaged, taking adequate time to listen to my concerns, asking questions to better understand the symptoms I was experiencing.  He was very thorough in explaining my diagnosis to me, making sure I understood what the skin condition was, taking time to educate me on ways to alleviate the symptoms, and providing guidance on how to use the prescribed medications.  Dr. MacGregor and all of the associates in the office were very personable, cordial, and professional.  I was very pleased with my overall experience as I felt that my concerns were heard, my questions answered, and I felt confident that I was receiving the appropriate treatment for my skin condition.</review>< pictures>

<text>I have taken good care of myself and Dr. MacGregor MD agreed, after looking me over.

The office staff was personable and pleasant as was Dr. MacGregor. The office was clean and I felt safe being there which is important during this time of Covid pandemic.< /text></record>

Dr. MacGregor was very good.  He obviously had read the info I had completed in the patient portal that I had completed before I arrived.  He listened to my concerns  and explained what he felt was my problem and what he would do and what he expected me to do prior to my next visit with him in 3 weeks.  Dr. MacGregor and his staff were excellent.</Review>

Dr. MacGregor is the best! He has been following me for a long time for rosacea and after medication, creams and advice on lifestyle changes, it has cleared up really well and he’s been so supportive. He even helped me when it affected my eyes and his calm and clear explanations were very helpful. I can’t say enough about Dr. MacGregor!!</Review>

Nearly 20 years after I first started seeing MacGregor, it's always a great experience, whether I see him or Christina Tucker. My Irish skin thanks them.< /Text>

<review>I've been seeing Derm. Dr. MacGregor about 10 years now, both in the CPMC Dermatology Clinic, as well as his private office at 450 Sutter St., recently moved up four floors to Ste. 1824.  He and his staff are very knowledgeable, caring, thorough, and suggest best options for both medically-necessary, as well as cosmetic procedures.  The new suite is quite spacious, well-lit, and comfortable compared to the old suite.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><name>C. Quinn</name>< rating>

I have been a patient of Christina Tucker for ~2 years now.  The office is well located on downtown San Francisco, so if you live/work near the financial district, the location is convenient.  Staff is nice and efficient at making appointments when you are there.  If you call, you have to leave a message.  Alternatively, you can use the website.  Christina as a doctor is nice, but the treatment I received lasted for ~2 years, which sometimes I think it could have been less.< /Review>

I am a 59 year old man who has been living with the HIV virus for at least 35 years, when the first blood test to detect and identify the virus was discovered,1984. I tested HIV positive then at the age of 24, and I was subsequently diagnosed with AIDS in 1992.
Living with the HIV virus for so long has altered my facial features. Weather by the disease or from the medication to treat the disease, my face became more and more gaunt, my cheeks more sunken in, and my facial bones, especially my cheek bones, became very pronounced. I had lipodistrophy. My body  could not maintain or produce healthy facial fat tissue. I was very self conscience of my appearance and it effected my self esteem.
Dr. MacGregor, the friendly and welcoming staff of the front desk, and the
warm sensitivity of the  professional personable assistance, make my appointments comfortable and efficient. The consistent and understandable communication with me and with each other as a team is excellent.
I just had my fourth treatment yesterday, replacing and stimulating the collagen in my face. I became tearful when I first saw my reflection in the mirror after the treatment. My face is now significantly more full and my bone structure is not as protruding and pronounced.The cumulative effect of the treatments have been dramatic for me. I am very pleased.
The good works of Dr. MacGregor and the staff have increased my self esteem,  given me more confidence, and has added to my social life.  Today, I am a happier and healthier looking me.
Thank you,
George< /Text>

Very much appreciate that I was able to make an appointment and see Dr. MacGregor within two days for some troubling but non-emergency concerns. We started right on time, and Dr. MacGregor quickly and competently assessed the two skin issues I had. He also provided reassurance they weren't as big a deal as I feared. Best of all, Dr. MacGregor thoroughly and clearly answered my questions, which is  makes all the difference for me in trusting a doctor and continuing to be a patient.< /Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I am a long time patient of Dr. David MacGregor.  He is a pleasure to work with.  He is almost always running on time, listens to you and your issues, does not try to oversell, and works with you to keep improving your skin problems.  I have had other experiences with other noted SF dermatologists who were always trying to oversell their services and were a pain to wait for and deal with.  Dr. MacGregor and his team are none of this.  If you have a skin issue go and see him!<//Review>< Pics>

Both the staff and Dr. MacGregor were very respectful and thoughtful. My initial appointment phone calls were answered promptly and I was able to actually talk to someone in the office instead of the answering service. I arrived early for my appointment and was able to fill in my registration in the office. Shortly thereafter I was escorted to a exam room by an attendant. She was very friendly and soft spoken. I did not have to wait long for the doctor. He listened and decided that a biopsy was needed to determine what I had. Overall, a great first experience. Nice, clean office; pleasant staff and a doctor who listens.<//Review>

Very easy to make appointment and get checked in. Polite and efficient staff. Doctor was also polite and efficient and professional. Office was a bit crowded and things moved quickly during visit but overall things were addressed as required. Would have preferred a bit more time with doctor and more explanation about medicines and potential pathology of lesion removed but overall very pleased. Appreciate that cosmetic procedures and skin care products were not pushed. Focus was on health of my skin and my few concerns.</Text>

Very professional office.  Super-friendly front desk staff, excellent treatment by Dr. MacGregor and his assistants.  I recommend them highly.

On this recent, semi-annual checkup, I had yet again a professional yet personal experience.  Dr. MacGregor’s is exactly the way all medical offices should operate.</text>

The staff was prompt in replying to my request for an appointment and they got me in the next day because of a cancellation. Paperwork was done digitally and efficiently. Dr. MacGregor came in and was confident in his approach/proposal, giving me context around his decision. Great experience overall.</review>

It's always a pleasure to see David MacGregor! He is very thorough and certainly knows his skin cancers. He is almost never wrong when he determines that a biopsy is necessary .

The office is cute, on the 14th floor of a marvelous old building and with quite the view.</review>

Dr. MacGregor does impeccable work for both serious dermatological services and cosmetic procedures. It is rare to find a doctor so skilled in both areas. He is interested in skin health and if engaged thus, your looks as well. He asks for follow up visits to check on his work which speaks volumes for his desire to do his best for his patients.</text>

As always, excellent appointment with Dr. MacGregor and his staff, both admin and nursing.
Could not ask for more competence, care and attention.

Follow up visit after biopsy: removal of basal cell carcinoma went smoothly as usual. I also pointed out several recent spots my on legs: Dr. MacGregor carefully examined and then "froze".<//Review>

<review>Quick, simple consultation appointment went quite smoothly. Front desk was friendly and pre-registration worked well. Would be ideal if they were able to send appointment reminders shortly before the appointment (especially since it can be months from scheduling date to appointment date)<//review>< resp>

Dr. MacGregor and his team always take their time during my appointment and ask the right questions. They're usually on schedule and I feel very confident with my examination. I spent way too much time in the sun as a child and young adult, so they seem to take extra care when looking over my sun damaged skin.< /Review>

Dr. MacGregor is a great dermatologist. He is also very prompt and his office staff is great. I have been going to him for several years and have always gotten exceptional care. My first visit, he caught something another derm had said was nothing to worry about. Thank you, Dr. MacGregor!<//Review>

Fantastic experience. By far the most thorough skin check I’ve ever had—and the most personable dermatologist I have ever been to. I was nervous going in about some moles but felt like I was in great hands right away with Dr. MacGregor. He also removed a mole for me—a quick, easy, and completely painless process!< /Review>

Dr. MacGregor is absolutely the best.  I sent a message over the weekend regarding my skin concerns.  Monday morning he personally calls me, listens attentively to determine the severity, and has his staff make an appointment for the very same day because of past history.

His professionalism mixed in with personal care is what David MacGregor is all about.</Review>

Have been a patient at Dr. MacGregor's office for a few years now.  I have always been treated with respect and warmth (and efficiency too).  He is an extremely knowledgeable, experienced physician and his staff are top notch.  If you choose to go to his practice, you won't be disappointed.< /Review>

Dr. MacGregor is the best and his office staff are super helpful. They are efficient and run the office like a business which I appreciate. Everything was quick, on time, and ran smoothly. But most important, Dr. MacGregor acknowledged my concerns. We all have things about our skin that bother us and Dr. MacGregor didn't try to tell me my concerns were insignificant. Instead he just fixed them! I am super excited and can't wait to have great skin :)<//review>

I am so happy with the quality of care that I receive from Dr MacGregor and his fantastic staff. One of his staff members has been there longer than I’ve been going to this practice, that shows you how stable things are at his office.

Dr. MacGregor is a fantastic physician.  He is no nonsense, no drama and knows his stuff.  His  clinic runs with efficiency and professionalism.  Front desk staff are fast and thorough. He also has an excellent online patient portal which is one of the best I have seen.  Definitely recommend Dr. MacGregor!!</Review>

Update, October 2, 2019. Still having on going treatment.  The results are beyond my expectations and look totally natural. Doctor Macgregor is a artistically skilled physician.

Wonderful experience. Staff is polite, respectful and considerate. Doctor Macgregor's manner is the utmost of efficiency and professionalism. I am very pleased with the results of work done.<//text>

I was a new patient and was warmly welcomed by the front office staff.  I was taken into the appointment on time.  Dr. MacGregor was very kind very thorough.  He listened and responded thoughtfully to my questions.
My husband is looking for a dermatologist...and our primary is writing the referral for Dr. MacGregor.</review>

<Text>Dr. MacGregor is very thorough in his examination and takes time to  discuss his findings and "next steps" with his patients.  I've been seeing Dr. MacGregor for the last several years for my annual checkup, and have been very impressed with the treatment I've received from both Dr. MacGregor and his wonderful staff!< /Text><userid>111167043842441694975< /userid><rate>5<//rate>< Response>

<Review>Dr. MacGregor is awesome. Punctual, professional, doesn’t push products or services, educates you, removes moles with no pain. Highly recommend him. And his front office staff are welcoming and friendly.</Review>< Rating>

the office is current, comfortable with lots of light and a friendly staff. I have never had to wait for my appointment.

dr. macGregor is kind, gentle in nature and skillful. He is a great combination of compassionate being and medical professional. I have always been comfortable and professionally cared for in his office.</text>

Dr. MacGregor is the best. So lucky to have found his practice! He answers all questions, assuages all fears, understands you questions, reccommends just as much as you need - never less and never more! Never rushed but also quick in and out once you’re his patient. Confident and kind!<//Review>

<Text>I have been a patient of Dr. MacGregor for the last 10+ years and have found him to be great at keeping the sun damage to my fair skin under control .  He caught early what could have been a serious problem and nipped it in the bud.  Surgery was perfectly done.

Kristina Tucker (Physician Assistant) is also great and takes loving care of the skin issues for our teenage children.  Both are highly recommended.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I've been seeing Dr. MacGregor for 15 years for my moles and freckles. My appointments are always fast and thorough, and he immediately finds and takes care of the suspicious areas. He's removed an item from my cheek in an early visit, and it healed so well you can't even tell I had an issue.  For those who are into cosmetic surgery, he has those treatments too. I'm not one of those people, so I appreciate that he has just focused on my appointment and never tried to upsell me.</review>

Dr. MacGregor is a great physician! He was kind, he listened, and he clearly articulated how the different symptoms I'm having relate as well as the circumstances that may have caused them. I finally 'got' what might be going on -- that makes all the difference for me in actually following through on his recommendations. This is after going to quite a few other doctors. He's definitely a good one.< /Review>

After not having an appointment in quite a while due to the pandemic, today's visit reminded me why I like him so much.  Not only did I not have to wait to see him, he was efficient and personable.  I like that I never have felt that I was "just another patient".  I will definitely continue to highly recommend him.<//review>

He walked me through everything during the initial exams, he wasn't pushing me in any direction other than what he thought was best, and the procedure itself went very smoothly.  I can already see that scarring will be minimal compared to what I got from a different provider the last time I had to get a cyst removed.  Staff was excellent and friendly, reception reliable & flexible, web portal was easy to navigate, billing was fair and in line with what we discussed.  Would STRONGLY recommend if you need surgery and want to minimize hassle and scarring.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Time>1506953748350< /Time>< userid>

I had such a great experience going to dr.'s MacGregor office. Since all the paper work was done on line, It took less then 5 minutes to complete a new patient initial entry. I was called in almost immediately.  Doctor addressed all of my questions and I left the office in 15 minutes. My prescription was submitted on line for my convince.  I highly recommend this office.<//Text>

< Review>
As someone with fair skin and lots of sun exposure over the year, I've seen a number of dermatologists in the past 25 years.  Dr. MacGregor is by far the sharpest, most thorough and professionally conservative Dermatologist I've seen today - now 7 years into bi-annual appointments.</Review>

I've been in Dr. David J MacGregor's care for 2 years and I'd gladly recommend him.

The medical-care I continue to receive from him and his team is consistently excellent and the entire experience of every interaction is educating and comforting and my visits are always conducted in a professional manner, like clock-work.
I never feel rushed during my check-ups and Dr. MacGregor and his staff are always attentive and they follow through.< /text>

Doc Macgregor is simply the best at what he does...and his manner and attention to detail is
First rate...when y9u add to his professionalism the courtesy, punctuality, and flexibility of his staff.
The Macgregor experience defies most of the disappointing game medical care  we have accustomed ourselves to..Dan Weinstein<//Review>

<text>Dr. MacGregor is an excellent doctor. I have been going to him 3 times a year as I have sun damage to my face, head, and other areas. This visit was for the IPL treatment, a laser procedure to remove the red and brown spots from my face. I will do an additional treatment in a month and possibly a third depending on the necessity. It stings a bit but no big deal. The results are worth it.
My previous visit  2 months ago was a full body scan. At that time the doctor noticed 2 areas of concern. As it turned out I had a basil cell carcinoma on my shoulder. I went in to have it removed. This is the second time Dr. MacGregor has found cancer and the previous one was on my forehead and required a trip to UCSF for a lengthy removal of the cancer. I had not noticed anything on my forehead. Dr. MacGregor has the eye to see these things, thank God. I feel extremely lucky to have been referred to the doctor by my primary doctor. He is a first class, top knotch, 5-star MD.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Review>This was my first interaction with Dr. MacGregor.  His team / office was well organized... Dr MacGregor took his time doing a skin check and proposing a proactive approach for treating a severe rash.

I left the office with a plan of attack for my rash and a follow up appointment. I could not be happier.</Review>< rate>

Dr. MacGregor removed a basal skin cancer from my neck in only a few minutes. It was a hard one to find but he found it and eradicated it. No pain. I'm very pleased.< /text>

Not even a patient... But they keep sending me someone else's appointment confirmation emails. And there is NO way to speak to a real person by calling the office. Every option in the phone maze leads to a voicemail. Unless I want to go through the effort of subscribing to their "Patient Portal" which is, as they themselves admit, is the best way of reaching someone.<//text>

<Review>I work in the health care profession so I'm particularly attuned to what is good care - and I've been very impressed with this office across the board - Dr. MacGregor - the PA Ms. Tucker - and the staff. Efficient but quality care. They have very useful technology such as the ability to communicate via their portal, and the staff are unusually responsive. And they don't try to overtreat you or convince you that you need services that you really don't. Straight shooters and skilled. The best!</Review>< pics>

Four stars because a mistake was made in scheduling me with the paraphysician instead of with MacGregor, but it was rectified. The doctor saw me and handled my problem with his usual assuredness and attentiveness. I came away feeling listened to and taken care of.</review>

Dr. MacGregor has been my dermatologist for more than 15 years. I have every confidence in his care and advice. He's helped me through a series of pesky rashes, moles and lumps that I'm glad have disappeared. I would recommend him to anyone.<//text>

I have been seeing Dr. MacGregor for several years and he found a small area of skin cancer on my face which I did not notice at all.  He is thorough and I like his demeanor.</text>

Outstanding is the word I would use to describe Dr.Mac Gregor. After years of medication I was referred to Dr.Mac Gregor to see if he could help with the loss of fat in my face (Lipodystrophy & Wasting). It got to a point I would avoid being in photographs.  From the moment I went through the process of making an appointment to meeting the Doctor my hopes were high. I must add, of the doctors assistant, she couldn't have been more gentle and encouraging.and of his billing department, she  kept me in the loop with the challenges of my insurance.  No promises can be made but i have no doubt she is fighting for me.  I feel  like I have a whole team working for me.  I can not put into words the joy of the results!  I am big on Selfie's now!
THANK YOU ALL< /text>
