<Text>Dr. Levine is a real wizard! He is very experienced. Already after one session I felt much better, after the second visit I felt very big difference, too. Along with Doctor's treatment there are speacial devices which stretch the spine. The staff is friendly, the atmosphere is good, the space is clean.
I highly recommend this chiropractor. Your body will be grateful.<//Text><time>1610596229879<//time><Rating>5</Rating><user_id>113412443776795664958</user_id><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

Looking forward to seeing you at your next visit!'}</Resp><review>I usually don’t write reviews, but this place deserves a lot more recognition. I’ve had chronic lower back pain for as far as I can remember (maybe a decade and a half) and I always thought to myself that it was normal. I got used to cracking my back on my own, but the relief was only temporary and it became a habit and never fixed the underlying problem. Same goes with my neck and upper back.

Fast forward to last week, I made up my mind to give a chiropractor a visit for the first time in my life. I setup an appointment and met Dr. Levine. I explained to him about my condition. He did a quick scan from top to bottom and listed all my misalignments which caused my neck, upper and lower back pain, etc. I was super impressed with Dr. Levine’s depth of knowledge and his experience was evident.

Today, after my second visit, I cannot explain how grateful I am to Dr. Levine and his amazing team. I cannot recall a day in my life where I had absolutely zero pain in my entire body. There’s no pinching in my lower back, my neck feels great, my upper back is relaxed. I’ve been doing yoga for quite sometime, but today’s session felt like I was doing it for the first time. I had no pain in lifting my legs up and back in the downward dog position; no pain in high cobra position; no pain whatsoever.

I take this opportunity to thank Dr. Levine and his team for this outstanding practice. A special shoutout to the receptionist. I was nervous at first as it was going to be my first time at a chiropractor center, but she patiently answered all my questions and made me feel comfortable. I really appreciate the work from every single member at the Stevens Creek Chiropractic center and I cannot wait to get back for my next session.< /review><GmapID>0x808fcaeeeb6f1dfd:0xb9d011f40442fc39< /GmapID><Time>1614490920179< /Time>< rating>

< review>
Being that this was my first time seeing a chiropractor I wasn’t quite sure what to expect and a bit nervous of the process. The very moment I arrived at Stevens Creek chiropractic I felt at ease thanks to the very friendly/helpful staff who went out of there way to make sure every question was answered with clear thorough responses. Dr. Jeffery B Levine  was absolutely amazing! Before we started he sat down with me to hear exactly what issues I am experiencing, never felt rushed as he sincerely had an open ear to really listen to my concerns. Within moments he was able to locate alignment issues with my body that have caused discomfort to my everyday routines. With his experienced staff, top of the line equipment and best practices I left there feeling like a new man! As well as a bit taller. Looking forward to my continued weekly appointments with the great Dr. Levine! A++++ all around! Thank you!!</review>

Dr. Levine and Staff are Excellent and so kind. I have been going to Dr. Levine for almost 2 years for adjustments here and there, and every single time I go, I feel like a new person when I step out. Migraines and pain (neck , back and low back) are my biggest areas, and I feel relief after one visit. Really good natural supplements too, which I find help my body heal.  Thank you, Dr. Levine and Staff!</Review>

Dr. Jeff is fantastic! During a difficult economic time, he’s been offering free exams and nutrition plans to all his patients. I was able schedule an appointment same day that I reached out. He was detailed with his examination and provided me an excellent full body adjustment. The office assistant was able to get in touch with my insurance during my appointment to make sure I was covered and then went through all payment options before I left the office. If you want excellent chiropractic care and genuine customer service come to Stevens Creek Chiropractic!< /review>

< Review>
Best chiropractor in the world! I’ve been to MANY chiropractors and none of them come close to the care that Dr. Levine gives his patients. None of them have been able to correct my problems as well or as quickly as Dr. Levine either. Absolute best chiropractic practice.< /Review>

Everyone here is very pleasant and Dr Levine is great. I currently have a regular chiropractor but was in need of decompression treatments, which she doesn't have the table for. When she retires (which she is talking about doing in possibly a year or two) I will definitely move over to S.C.C. for all my chiro needs!
One thing in particular I like about Dr. Levine is that he TALKS to you and EXPLAINS things -- in plain English so you understand what he is doing and why...very important to some...and ME! And if you need something extra, he does what he can to satisfy; for example, I had a full treatment yesterday and appointments set up for three more next week, and this morning woke up with my sciatica raging. I called to see if I could be squeezed in for a quick "hip-drop" (for lack of a better term). They brought me in and did just that. Plus Dr L showed me a procedure I could do on my own at home if it happened again. Not every chiropractor will do that.
I whole-heartedly recommend Dr L and his team of therapists!
Thank you, Dr. Levine!</text>

Dr. Levine and his staff are top notch. They truly care about their patients and their wellbeing.  I love the fact that I can usually get in when I tweak my neck or back. During Covid-19, they are keeping their office sterilized and clean the treatment area after each patient to assure that everyone remains healthy.</Review>

I had neck pain for about a year and I have tried all, NSAIDS and muscle relaxants, frequent massages, physician recommended stretches and nothing helped, after a session with Dr.Levine, my neck pain is gone, my neck and overall joint mobility improved, my in-turned foot has looked straighter. highly recommended, in fact I am evangelical about not only Dr.Levine but the whole team!< /Text>

< review>
If you need your neck or back cracked, Dr Levine is your man! He literally will adjust your body and give it a good cracking from A-Z. He is really interested in seeing your body free of pain, evenly matched up, and stretched out. I really like how flexible they are with times and hours and how I am always able to get an appt same day. They even have some hours open on the weekends. Their physical therapist is amazing and they stretch you out good on a machine adding a vibrating massager to hit areas which are tense or have a lot of pain or knots. Then you choose a machine to add more therapy to a troubled area. The place is clean has a bathroom, and sometimes snacks on the counter. They send text messages to remind of you appts or will give you a phone call sometime. I really like the service and people here which is why I continue to return. I highly recommend Dr Levine!< /review>

<Review>Dr. Levine has a very professional and friendly staff.  I have been to several other chiropractors and they are good as well.

I was in pain from lower back side and neck muscle pull. Fortunately I found this place (I have named it as healing zone :-)) Dr. Jeff looks AND feels to be really experienced in the field of chiropractic Treatment. After second visit I did observe my pain go down from 10 to 3 - and I continue to heal with my followup visits. There are many machines to help the body. Doctors team (special thanks to Art) are very friendly and skilled at what they do. front desk is helpful in appointment reminders and followups. Office has friendly and positive vibes. would recommend this service to all who would like to get healed!<//Text>

Dr Levine is great, before he adjusts you, there are all these other machines that can relax your muscles first. Also he gives good nutrition suggestion with Standard Process products.</Text>

<review>I was suffering a lot of back pain when I went to Jeff Levine, DC.  He was one of the only chiropractors open on Saturday locally.  My pain level went immediately down compared to physical therapy and acupuncture that I normally did for my back pain.  Over the course of the year with weekly Saturday sessions (I work pretty far), I began standing up straight.

As part of the treatment, he suggests a number of effective stretches and exercises to help improve and strengthen your body.  If done regularly, it will reduce your pain and the need to come in.  Kind of contradictory for a business, but I'm sure you will come in for any additional problems you have since you will develop trust in Dr. Levine.

For my particular situation, I need to also do deep tissue massage to loosen things up.  Luckily, his onsite massage staff are very effective.

The staff also have a number of machines that will help loosen up, stretch, and/or warm up your body prior to treatment.

You should try Dr. Levine if you've tried other things ( and haven't improved.  Dr. Levine is an trustworthy, effective, knowledgeable and caring chiropractor</review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Dr. Levine provides a high degree of chiropractic  care with knolledge of various types of treatment techniques and uses special lumbar and spine rejuvenation machines assisted by highly skilled message therapists that apply a special hands on approach that will have you on your way to better, healthier spine that is rivaled by none , with a dose of humor for good measure.(Far exceeded my expectations).< /review>

I Love going to see Dr  Lavine.  My body always feels so good in the next few days after an adjustment.  He know just how to adjust my neck
and body.  He is masterful!  I wish I could go to see him every week or two.  I like going into his chiropractic  office.  Leslie is always so warm and she greets me when I walk thru the door.
Dr. L......  you're the greatest.  Your smile always sets me at ease.<//Text>

< review>
I bought a groupon for a massage and free chiropractic consult here. I hadn't been to a chiropractor in ages and Dr. Levine was great. He did a good job explaining and demonstrating things and was not pushy at all. The woman at the front desk (I think her name was Leslie) was excellent. She was so kind and friendly. Lastly, my massage with Maria was wonderful. It was probably one of the best "traditional" (as opposed to thai) massages I have ever received. Thank you for your great service Stevens Creek Chiropractic!< /review>

I have been to a lot of Chiropractors and unfortunately this has been the worse experience.

I was charged $80 for 35/40mins which consisted of

15mins laying on the floor with a heating pad (could have done that at home)
20 mins of his assistance throbbing my back which didn’t help AT ALL

Remainder of the time was cracking my neck...

This is absolutely not what chiropractors do- been so over a dozen

Don’t waste your time here, go to Dr Vanderhoof in Palo Alto-<//review>

< review>
Dr. Levine is excellent in chiropractic care. I've injured my lower back at the Gym and I was in a deep pain where I had hard time walking few steps. On top of that I was suppose to travel in few days when this incident happened. I immediately realized that I need to see someone and started looking for a chiropractor. In desperation and without much research I found Dr. Levine' contact information. I was lucky to find him because in 3 days not only my pain subsided significantly but also started walking normally as if nothing happened to me. After the 5th visit in a row I was perfectly normal and I was able to successfully travel internationally keeping my commitments. This is all due to Dr. Levine. Unlike other places where they show you a big startup cost and a pre-payment plan taking up your initial bill to give you a sticker shock, Dr. Levine immediately realized what is wrong and what to do to fix my back. I like that approach. His fees are very reasonable too. I would recommend him anyone in need of a Chiropractic care.</review>

After seeking help from multiple other chiropractors, I finally found Dr. Levine and couldn't be anymore satisfied.  His methodology and technique gave me instant relief to both my chronic upper back pain and migraines.  It's been almost two years with him and I have no desire to seeking anyone else.  I fully recommend Dr. Levine.< /review>

Jeff Jenkins is a wonderful chiropractor and an extraordinary man. I have been a client of his for over six years since moving up from Southern California to the Bay Area in 2009. During that time, he has provided me with chiropractic and message therapy care on a once per monthly basis (on average).

"Dr. J," as affectionately referred to by his patients, has always been immensely energetic, extremely caring, and devoted to my care. I have observed the same treatment from him on patients coming in before and after me, without fail. What I love about Dr. J is that he actually spends quality time with me; he listens to my condition, responds with preventive care recommendations, and best of all, provides a thorough hand and machine-assisted body massage prior to performing a series of expert adjustments at key areas on my neck, back, hips and shoulders.

He has a wealth of Chiropractic experience, bolstered by a specialty in message therapy, which he leverages generously in treating his patients. I have been to other DCs in the past, and they provide much less time and attention, focusing only on adjustments and never incorporating any massage therapy or table traction work.

Lastly and perhaps most importantly; Dr. J is a motivational force; he effectively lives a life of personal accountability and positivity, and encourages his patients to do the same. His personal anecdotes and empowering stories provide a steady source "rich mental protein" for those of us who ride the treadmill of corporate work-life existence. He dishes them out generously while graciously doing his work for you on the traction table.

"Your Life. Your Responsibility" is a mainstay of encouragement at the office, and it shows in the atmosphere there; you can literally feel it from his patients and their families. It's wonderful to have an example of such a nurturing and caring doctor in the face of a changing healthcare system that puts increasing pressure on healthcare providers like Dr. J by controlling and limiting service reimbursement.

I recommend Dr. J to anyone looking for chronic or recurring pain relief (due to repetitive stress or otherwise), and especially those who wish to stay physically active well into their 30s and 40s. I credit my ability to run and swim regularly and pain-free to his routine care. I also recommend Dr. J as a generous and compassionate healthcare provider.<//text>

This is my local Jack. I frequent frequently. I if usually get freshly made food from here. This time was not exception. The only time there is ever a hiccup is on the fries and curly fries at night. Its unusual if your get both and are both fresh. Other than that awesome. Thanks<//Review>

After an Extremely Bad experience on Sunday 02/14/2021, I was Never going back to this location even though it was about minutes away from my home! However, I submitted a complaint online through the company's website and to my surprise the following day I was contacted by a JITB representative by the name of Priscila.
I explained to Priscila the details of what happened that night. I explained to her that it was not my first time at this location and that Usually the staff is Very Helpful and Friendly. However, that night this was not the case. I told her that upon placing my order at the drive-thru I asked the person taking the order to Please Not place ice in the drink. I had been experiencing flu-like symptoms and I thought the ice Would worsen this. When I arrived to the window to pay, the young lady by the name of "Teresa" (I know this b/c that was the name on the receipt) handed the drink to me. I Immediately noticed it had ice and Politely told her that I had asked for the drink with No Ice. What she stated next not only shocked me but it Extremely upset me as well. She stated "Well you should have told me when you placed the order!" Her manner was like she was scolding Me and she actually seemed upset for those couple of seconds.
I then stated to her that I Did let her know that I asked for No Ice in the drink. At No point did this young lady even take the time to apologize for a simple mistake. THAT to me was Even More upsetting! So I asked her for her name, to which she RUDELY replied "It's On The Receipt!" I then asked if her manager was available, to which she replied "I Am the manager." I asked her if she could please give me the name and number of her district manager and she again, stated yet Even More upset, "You can look it up online!"
I was Extremely Shocked and UPSET so I decided to place the formal complaint on the company's website. The JITB representative (Priscila) listened to what I had to say and the details of my experience that night. She Formally Apologized and Genuinely Understood and Empathized with my concerns. She Definitely "made-up" for the Extremely bad experience I had gone through that night. I would Definitely recommend this location to friends and family however, if something doesn't seem right then let it be known. And if you do "formally" complain for any reason rest assured that your issue Will Be addressed by JITB!<//text>

< Review>
I have been here twice since the CV19 scam-demic, because places closer to home are only doing drive-thru. The employees are very polite & friendly. I appreciate being able to pick up my food on foot, as I currently do not have a car for the drive-thru. I will remember their kindness when the fearporn ends and we return to business-as-usual.< /Review>

What a bunch of scam artists!  "We can replace this for you for only $15 if you go anywhere else it will be hundreds of dollars."  Good thing I know how to work on cars...  I know that hose wouldn't cost more than a buck or two.< /review>

<review>I will never enter the DMV again. It will cost a bit more - but not having to go to the DMV is worth a lot of money.

Tried to register my car at the DMV three times, turned away each time (thanks COVID)

They did it in 15 minutes. Quick smog check, too.

Great, family run small business.< /review>< rate>

Awesome service and people.  They do VIN verification, brake and light inspection, registration and repairs and of course smog.  It's a husband and wife team, both very nice professional people.  I highly recommend Joe's Smog for all your DMV registration, repair and smog needs.  It's a one stop shop.</text>

< Review>
I recently bought a used vehicle, which failed the smog test on visual, functional, and emissions. The smog tech at Joe's took time to advise me on what to look out for, what to fix and return for the free retest. I followed his advice, and found additional malfunctioning parts that I replaced on my own with some online research. I returned with all repairs completed on my own and passed with extremely low emissions and it is now CA state legal! I recommend Joe's Smog if your vehicle requires Emissions testing.</Review>

I've had a similarly bad experience with the pricing of this business's service.  Their coupon said nothing about the price not being applicable if you fail the test.  I did fail and the owner said that I then needed to pay full price.  Good thing I wasn't in a confrontational mood that day!

UPDATE:  ...and it got worse.  Went back today for the re-test only to be told that since it had been three weeks since the original test it was no longer free.  It does, in fact, say so on the receipt... but I don't read receipts, as most people don't.

I left, went to Auto Check Centers in Hollywood, and will never be back to this place again.

Avoid them.  They're flat out crooks.</Text>

They knew I wouldn't pass smog because my check engine light was on. Instead of doing the right thing and informing me it wouldn't pass. They took my money anyways. They have some stupid coupon system in place. It's a rip off. They might have taken 60 dollars from me once but they lost my business forever. And everyone I know will now how shitty this place is. STAY AWAY.<//review>

He took my keys to start the check while I was still filling out the paperwork, then came back and told me what my mileage was without me even having to ask so I could put it on the form, which was great because I forgot to check beforehand. They accepted the coupon from the website, it didn't feel like they were trying to sell me anything I didn't need, and I didn't have to wait longer than 5-10 minutes so I was able to head right back over to the DMV down the street. I think they did a fine service and if you're looking for a convenient place while you're at the DMV, this place is more than adequate.< /Review>< Pics>

Great place to get your smog test owners are very nice and take the time to advise on any issues you may have with your vehicle. They also provide dmv servises without the hasel of a huge line. I will definitely be going there again.< /Review>

<text>This place is AWESOME!!!! They were so friendly and helpful. We were in an incredible hurry to get our SUV smog checked and registered so we could sell it to Carmax and then make it to LAX in 2 hours. It did not seem possible, but they got us in and out in 30 minutes flat and took care of everything from the smog check, to getting the vehicle registered with the DMV on the spot, and then also providing the stickers for the plates. It was total one stop shop, without the hassle of the DMV. Then we sold the SUV and made it to LAX with time to spare.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Joe's Smog Center!!!!!!!!
Thanks so much for helping us out.</text><GmapID>0x80c2c00f5fe37da3:0x25d791661e41eaa9< /GmapID><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

In addition to the smog test, they can accept your car registration payment and they then can put your new sticker on after taking off all the old ones.< /review>

My brother ordered a blended coffee drink for me and they didn’t blend it. I went back to the store and told them and they said he didn’t say “blended”. I asked them if they can just blend my current drink and they didn’t want to. Then they told me i had to pay for another drink if i wanted it blended. Starbucks just replaces drinks. Even if they didn’t hear my brother say “blended” what do they have to loose my blending the drink they already made for me? I rarely write bad reviews but this was just annoying and horrible customer service. Ive been going to this coffee bean for almost 10 years but not anymore.<//review>

It's a small shop in a shopping center but a very nice one. The staff was very nice and attentive to the customers coming in. The service was great and I didn't have to wait too long. Best of all, if you enjoy coffee bean & tea leaf, you'll be happy getting your guilty pleasure here.< /Review>

Good afternoon,

I am a frequent customer at That location Coffee beans, (13420 Maxella Avenue - marina del Rey).
Amazing quality of coffee ☕️ , extremely rude costumer service (blonde Young  lady/
with super attitude). (4pm) Lack of training and obviously not manners at all.
I think management should be more careful when they hire people like her !!!<//Text>

Quick and efficient Coffee Bean that always has a polite and professional staff working. This is a typical, nice and clean Coffee Bean location. Most Importantly: They keep serving coffee until closing - much appreciated!<//text>

I'm not a fan of the coffee Bean & tea just because they don't use real milk, I'm always seeing them use powders of various kinds. The coffee is not always delicious and I feel like sometimes it's not strong enough or maybe that's just because I'm used to Starbucks. Customer service it was very unfriendly. I don't know if they were just not in a good mood at morning or they didn't feel like selling coffee. this place is located in the shopping center with the AMC movie theater and some other local eateries. Overall, if you want coffee and you like the coffee Bean & tea this is the place for you.</text>< pictures>

Be careful not to piss off Barista Briana, she'll make sure to treat you badly, make your drink wrong after providing service to everyone else and then try to intimidate you. Trust the last part made me laugh, though she did look like she wanted to have some kind of fight out in the parking lot, all because I asked what her name was. Whatever this woman's problem, she really shouldn't be there. This is one of my favorite locations, and she had not been there as of late and it was all the better for it. Unfortunately, she was back in all her bad attitude glory today, which earned the one-star. Honestly, save yourself the headache and stay clear while she's there.

UPDATE: CBT contacted me immediately about the issues with the individual above, and the matter is being addressed. Please note that the GM of this store, Cassandra, is AWESOME and Jonah is always there with a smile and easygoing attitude. The other team members, save the one mentioned above, work hard, are respectful and make sure that your orders are made as you like them. They will even remake if it is not quite right! Definitely one of the better stores to visit.</Text>

Great service. Their coffee is addictive!! This is now a regular stop for me at least twice a week. Make sure you download their app, The Coffee Bean, to sign up for their "club" thing and earn points towards discounts plus unlock "members only" deals and discounts that change often. There's always a deal going on there! I 🖤 my CB ☕️🙂< /Text>

<Text>Well, all I can say is there is pros and cons between starbucks and coffee bean, Starbucks has a better rewards program, coffee is good but they charge a 1.00 for a refill, while at Starbucks its free if a rewards member or 50 cents, you have to use the same cup for a refill? To me thats unsanitary or pay... But starbucks gladly Gives You a another cup, no hassle</Text><GmapID>0x80c2ba87c1b7419d:0x95b61ab79eb4b986</GmapID><Response>None<//Response><user_id>114111802292994150540</user_id>< Pictures>

<review>Being corporate workers, we were really very much stressed up due to our day to day office routine. But after visiting CoffeeBean Villa we were able to chill and get refreshed!! Very peaceful place to take out all the stress and relax. We would love to visit back there for the heart warming hospitality shown towards us by the staff.  It was indeed a blissful experience with loads of memories to take back.< /review>< rating>

<Text>I'm giving it 4 stars only to maybe get the attention from upper management, that's absolutely no reflection on the staff or service at that location, both are great.
I use the Coffee Bean app to order and pay for my drinks. I rarely carry cash anymore, so I appreciate that I can tip in the app. For some odd reason, and at that Marina Marketplace location only, I'm unable to do it. The option never comes up. I use it at other locations around town, no problem. The tip option comes up within a minute or so of ordering...it never works at the Marina location. I feel like a jerk, so I try to remember to have a couple of bucks on me when I go there, or if I'm not rush I'll go get cash...I used to be a barista and we relied heavily on tips. I wonder if it happens to other people. I would hate for that team to miss out. I've also contacted customer service. Just fyi, if you're going to this location, that's all.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Coffee Bean- there should be no room for colorism or partiality towards customers.</Review>

<Text>Communication was challenging and the attitude of the server was that he was in a bit of a frenzy. I guess he was feeling overwhelmed and needed to work hard and fast so he was short with me.

<Review>Still waiting on better service and staff, management needs a lot of improvement. The food is good and the drinks are medium, they need improvement. The  drinks here don't follow the original recipe Reqiations of the rest. The formulas needs to be properly retraining at this location. The store is clean and the outside of the shop is good enough. Lots of parking. Close to all that is Maria Del Rey.  Book store and theatre.< /Review><Rate>3</Rate><resp>None< /resp><Date>1499575084283< /Date>< Gmap_id>

<review>Why is it legal to serve drinks and have no bathroom?
Here sometimes baristas are nice and sometimes not. Today after putting in my drink order with tip, cashier/barista just argued with whoever else was there, didn't even say anything or look up at me. Very rude! they were arguing for like 10 minutes about who's going to do what job.
The air conditioner gets really cold then really hot.
Coffee is nasty but location is prime.< /review><Rating>3< /Rating>< username>

<Text>I have been a regular patron of CB Tea Leaf for years and this is my least favorite store,the best server was G and he has moved on to another job. Actually the ones I go to on the West side have changed,it seems the commitment to the customer service experience has gone. I was in this store on Monday and purchased a seasonal tea, the Swedish Berries hot; for years I have purchased this seasonal tea with the choice to have it hot or cold.On Monday I had a pleasant experience; I return on Thursday for the same tea, with the same female server and she wants to charge me 60 cents more because she says" it doesn't come hot or cold you can only have it cold or we charge you more"! And the way she spoke to me was rude, like I had in some way offended her because she had to stop her personal conversation to wait on me! I politely asked her when had the change taken place since I was just in on Monday and purchased it? She didn't answer so I said" give me my coffee bean and tea leaf card back",and left the store without purchasing anything. Why should I have to pay 60 cents extra just to have hot water, it is not the money but a change  that doesn't even make sense.I had a couple of hours to just have tea and read a book and just wanted to take my tea to the park and have a relaxing time.There is always something with this place it can rarely be a relaxing customer service experience. I have purchased a lot of gift cards here for friends for special occasions since I have so many friends that like teas.I also purchase the teas in the canisters.I always tip as well. They have lost a good customer! I am done!!

update ! I went to the Sepulveda and Palms  Coffee Bean and tea location on Monday and ordered the Swedish bitters tea hot and there were no words spoken about it only being a cold tea, and the price was the same as I always paid no mention about a  60 cent fee for hot water! The lady server was impeccable even telling me to let it steep for 7 minutes before I started to drink it ( which I already knew).  This has always been the location where I have received the best service sometimes it is just a little hard to navigate there because of the drive thru and constant activity but the service has always proven to be the best and then the Motor location and the Overland location would be the next two. I have been to all of them including the new one on Venice that is pretty much a drive-thru. I am a tea connoisseur. I have tea a few times a day. I still have $18 on my card to use up.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

About half the clientele are loud and braggy, making awkward business calls at full volume, etc. To be fair, the other half are really nice, considerate.<//Review>< Date>

<Text>Went in for a nitro brew.. stood in line, there was 1 person paying for coffee so I stood in line behind her. As soon as the transaction was done, 1 of the 2 women who walked in after me cut in front of me, okay... as she was taking her sweet time paying, a particularly shorter barista asked the other lady, who also came in after me what she'd like, even before the customer got to the counter. So not only do I get ignored by 2 customers who came in after me, but also a barista for whom I was invisible. But then again, maybe she couldn't see over the counter. Seemed as if she doesn't like ppl who order  nitro brew, the way she 'slammed' the drink on the pickup counter. As for the coffee and the 2 cashiers,  excellent! Friendly and curteous.<//Text>< pics>

DISGUSTING, sorry I’m not drinking or eating off a table with a dogs ass print or a place that allows animals to sit on top of tables.

Some pet owners are very disrespectful and disgusting, does this moron let his dogs sit on his kitchen and dining room tables?

See pic, CB&TL I hope you have your staff address this issue?<//Text>

<Review>Pozo Saloon, chilled back place to come for lunch and couple drinks on a nice weekend.  Service is  good and you can’t beat the atmosphere.  Plenty of outdoor seating.  People are very friendly.  Will be a weekend trip through High mountain road from Arroyo Grande.<//Review>< resp>

A quaint beer bar. Interior is not what you would expect, very little remains that would be 100 years old. The folks are friendly, bartender attentive, and a respectable selection of beer. There is talk of beginning to host concerts again. A fun place.< /review>

<Text>This place has so many good memories for me, from the Highland Games they used to host to the many concerts we have attended. While it is now under new ownership,  the ambience is still Pozo. We stopped here for lunch before heading up High Mountain road. Lunch was good, the company was better. Good times</Text><Rate>5<//Rate>< gmap_id>

I'm so happy the Saloon is open again. I grew up there and it is nice to see the same great food on the menu and still good prices for everything. The atmosphere is so laid back and fun. This is a great place to have a fun get together. The live music is always great and the staff are marvelous.</Review>

For the event I attended,  there were no 'in and out' privilege, however, that was not posted/communicated until AFTER the fact. Kind of a bummer. Sound was good, stage was well seen even from the back grass seating area. Not a lot of shade, so plan accordingly!<//text><gmapID>0x80ec88e74f0d477f:0xbe887db808e428c0<//gmapID><rating>4< /rating></record></dataset><record>

Food is average,  very expensive ($87 for 3 burgers and 3 beers! no fries). Had to wait a long time for food. Probably will not be going back.< /Review>

<Text>I must say this is one of the smallest, non descript pot shops I have ever been too. The place looked crowded just with the two guys and a girl behind the counter, the three employees that were working.
On first entering the store and taking quick note of the sparse looking inventory in the small display counter second thoughts about buying anything from this place ran through my mind.
But then one of the guys almost immediately offered a sample joint for my friend and I to smoke and long story short my friend and I left with our purchases, both of us high as a kite and completely satisfied with the experience. The product we bought turned out to be of high quality, no pun intended, but it fits. And the counter dude who acted as the main salesman was full of personality, being helpful and suggestive selling without being obnoxious about it, and he was hot to boot. Not a large variety of product there, but top quality for sure. I  recommend it.<//Text>< Pictures>

The Bartender behind the counter was amazing. Very knowledgeable and friendly. Not to mention the manager was just as great. They were very informed about all the product and was willing to answer any questions needed. I am not only super excited to get home to try what I purchased but to be able to come back next Sunday for a refill. Really great job guys keep up the good work. And if you're looking for a good spot this is the place to be.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlXsR5Kgc4vUgWoGC6CKNv7wRKi6tgDdypoBW2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>Its listed as 24 hours, but when I called at 1230 am (not late for a 24 hour place on a Friday night in my opinion) I got no answer. It went to voice-mail both times, which was full. Its seems like this is a repeat problem for this place. I never received a call or text after. I would recommend skipping the attempt and finding a place that is more on top of things. (I.e. posting proper hours, answering your phone, checking voice-mail, ensuring that everything on your Google business page is correct.)</text></record>

Super friendly staff, Jenna helped me. I came in with a certain amount to spent, and a specific product that I wanted. He went over every option available to me in my preferred price range. She also knew what he was talking about which was a plus. I appreciate that he was respectful towards my needs, and from that alone I will recommend this place to anyone. I will definitely go again.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMh_L7DOddnij5Hcs7NXnHBdm_hU6MEJ7zfZ2_B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

This business is sketchy. We called to see if they were open and if they delivered. They said they have a minimum of $500 for delivery, so we said that we would go there instead. They wanted me to text them a photo of my ID for the address, I texted them that I had the address from Google (that’s how I found this business) and they texted me “No thanks” I didn’t understand what this meant so I ended up going to the address since it was on google and they had decent reviews. When I got to the address it was a sketchy area, there was no business at the address that is listed. We texted them that we were at the address that was listed and they texted “Good luck with that” super sketchy. I texted “good luck with what? Is this not the address to your business?” They responded with  “Not accepting you” I texted “okay” and they text “so good luck with that” I am a business owner myself and I would never respond to a potential buyer/client in this way. They are not a legit business. Why would  they need me to text them a photo of my ID to get their address to receive my business? Or why would they respond so unprofessionally? It was so creepy. I got really bad vibes from these people. I wish I could share screenshots of our text conversation.</Text>

This establishment is Amazing. All of the staff are very friendly and helpful. They Produce and Package most of the inventory they have available. The Quality is most definitely there. I personally would come here any time of the day, they aren't busy and you'll never wait for more than five minutes.</Text>

UNPROFESSIONAL!!!! I tried calling to see what time they close the store and get a text asking what I’m looking for I asked what time the store closes and then they wanted me to send a photo of my ID and they wound send the address? Not what I was asking and I told them I just wanted to know the hours I didn’t need the address and all I got back was “good luck finding it” didn’t answer my question and was very rude avoid this place.< /text>

Bad quality. Both master kush and supreme og were horrible. Spent $90 on two eighths that were sub par. At least they delivered the pathetic weed.<//review>

Doesn’t even exist???  Everything here is closed up, nothing says 4120, and they don’t answer their phone.  Very angry - second place in a row I’ve driven 10-20 minutes to just to not exist.  Are fake dispensaries just a “thing” in LA?</text>

There was nothing at that location, Google error possibly, never was able to find.

Update: they wrote and said they Owere there, so I will try again when I can to see if Google was wrong. I showed the address and ask a lady who was opening 4128 where it could be and she said, no not here.</Text>

<time>1619257957387</time><Rating>4< /Rating><Review>I called top value on the suggestion of a friend. I felt that the person I talked to was friendly yet professional. While he had fairly reasonable prices I didn't want to cheat on my regular tire company. I will say that the tires he offered me were of a better quality than what I was looking for and it's not fair comparing apples to oranges. I am totally happy with my decision to remain loyal to a company that I was happy with. If they ever go out  of business I'll give Super Value another try.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Butttt prices are pretty steep this last week bringing it in the work I needed done would cost half somewhere else so that's a little disappointing and the owner of the shop who I deal with is good friends with my uncle so I kind of hoped I'd get a bit of deal because of it but didn't get any deal at all. Really wanted a shop that takes care of their clients like that, Not here though...  but it's a very trustworthy and reputable shop. Not sure if I'd take my baby in here for all the work that needs to be done but for most of the work for sure.</Text>< Response>

Colin has been our mechanic for a decade now, and always helps set things straight when dealerships try to charge us hundreds of dollars for something cheap. He's very efficient and I've never had a problem with my car after leaving.< /Review>

I have trusted TVT with my vehicles for over 20 years and I continue to recommend the shop to my friends.
They provide high quality work and honest pricing.
They specialize in tires, brakes and shocks, but also provide engine and drive line repair and service.<//review>

These guys are some of the most honest mechanics I have ever experienced. Wife thought cv joints were going out. After they ran their diagnostic test drive and visual inspection. Don't need them. No charge. Awesome 👍.< /Text>

<review>If you're looking for a trustworthy mechanic, one who will be upfront regarding pricing, repairs, and what actually needs to done as opposed to what can wait - this is the mechanic for you! I have never been so impressed with a mechanic's integrity as I was with the staff at Top Value and would highly recommend them to anyoe looking for someone they can trust.</review>< gmapID>

Excellent service, very knowledgeable. They just want to fix your car, no heavy sales pitch. Great service and done on time. Colin is the best! Everyone I meet was polite and respectful.
It's hard to find a good mechanic shop, this is a great one. They changed the clutch on my '09 Honda SI.
Update
2 weeks in and 600+ miles, runs like new.

Recommended this shop to a friend. They said excellent service, great advice. Repair was cheap and easy. They called with good advice after the repair started. Stayed on quote.<//Text>

I'm a week away from taking my vacation. I was in need of getting my breaks done that were long over due for a change regardless.

I found Top Value Tire by all the amazing reviews on Google and Yelp and let me tell you how happy I am that I did.

Colin and his team are fast and efficient. The price was reasonable and the service was top notch!
If you are looking for any type of car repair this is the place to go.</text>

Top Value Tire is the best! As a college student at SDSU, this place is nearby and super convenient. The service is also amazing. The guys are honest and always my go to for car advice. I love how they go the extra step when I get my oil changed and do somewhat of a general look over of my car and give me a projection of how it is doing.< /review>

My go to shop for any repair on my vehicle. Colin and all of his staff were friendly, honest and very upfront about all the work they did on my car. They called me with frequent updates throughout the whole process and only replaced what I actually needed instead of trying to upsell me like most other shops do. I would recommend this shop to all my friends and family without hesitation. Thanks again for the great work you do!</review>

Collin & his mechanics are the best place ever to take your car. We've been using them for over 15 yrs--the most honest and efficient shop ever. I've recommended them to several friends, who have been just as pleased as we are. They've helped us so many times, and we are always indebted to them. Thanks for being the best shop around!!!<//Review>

I had a spare tire fixed here and it was a great experience. They said they were busy on account of holidays, but if I brought it in today they would have it by end of day.

I brought tire in around 10am and I received a call around 2pm that the tire was ready. They even offered to mount it on my car at no charge.  Price quoted on the phone was the same as quoted in the store was the same as what I paid when I picked up the tire.

During the entire process the staff were extremely professional and friendly.

I absolutely would do business here in the future. I even grabbed a business card for a neighbor who I saw repairing a flat and tried to send my neighbor their way as well.

Call them first and save yourself the hassle< /Text>

Top Value Tire has been the place for our whole family to get their cars serviced, not just for tires. Three generations use this shop. Colin and his employees are honest and hard working. If they can't do it or do it right they will refer you on to someone that can. I trust them without hesitation.<//Review>

Top notch service you can get. I was looking to have my tires installed and I find them through Google search. I was skeptical at first but I'm glad I made the decision to come in.
Not only ones but I came back for my second vehicle to be serviced, and again the service was exceptional. No doubt, I'll be back again for any car problems I will have. The price is very fair and reasonable too.< /text>

<Text>They were the best price, and best service. They were so busy, I had to wait. Not really their fault, but I guess this place is super popular. Be prepared to wait, unless you have an appointment. Recommend getting an appointment.< /Text><Rating>4</Rating><gmapID>0x80d956ef488a8cef:0xaf606480a7db7ffd</gmapID>< Time>

<review>Totally competent and honest. When the 'stealership' was trying to rip us off we brought our car to Collin and his guys. They figured out the problem and had it fixed in one day for under $300 dollars. Mossy Nissan couldn't figure out the problem in 5 days and wanted over $1200 to fix something completely unrelated. I'll never take my cars anywhere else.<//review>< pics>

Been coming to this location since 2018.

I'm so grateful that they made it through the the Covid-19 pandemic and continue to offer their fantastic service.

Make sure to call ahead and schedule an appointment before you arrive because they can get pretty busy.

Thanks for all the great haircuts and keeping me pretty Jessica!!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Text>I'm a simple man, and came in for a simple haircut, so my metrics are equally simple: the cut needs to be professional, consistent, and affordable. Jessica's salon hits all three for me, and so I've been coming here for years.

I'm sure that she'll be able to do more if i asked, but I come here knowing what i want, and get it every time.<//Text>< username>

This is the best spot I have found in San Diego. I basically wait an entire year for Jessica to do my hair. Last year Jessica brought my hair back to life from a very horrible experience in another salon. Check out pictures to know what I am talking about. Jessica is the best and I would definitely recommend.</text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>I came to Jessica's three or four times before to get a haircut and so far it was alright until today. I went around 5:50pm, waited till 6:30pm for my turn and when it came, asked for the short trim like always. The lady gave me a very quick haircut. The sides looked alright, but I was suggesting whether the top parts are still too long. She said it might look bad if she shortens it anymore. Looking back, I think she was in a hurry to close the store and go home and therefore did a hasty job on my hair. I noticed the porblem with the haircut within five to ten minutes after leaving the store. She did not trim the hair on the left side properly and it is very easily noticable that there are locks of longer hairs (see photos). I called the store back immediately. It was not closing tine yet, but the same lady picked up and said that she already left the store and cannot take care of it today. It was surprizing that they left so quickly. Anyway,  the store does not open till 10:30am while my office starts at 8:30. I had to go to another salon to get my hair fixed. I am never going back to Jessica's again.</review>< Pictures>

<review>Jessica’s Hair Salon has been my #1 place to go since moving from Santa Monica.  Wouldn’t change it.  She does an amazing job with color.  She takes her time and is very professional.  She’s sweet and friendly.  Every time I stop by I feel welcomed.  Jessica thank you for my recent color.  I’m in love with my new color.</review><Gmap_id>0x80dc0763a281c39b:0xf3320bc423a9974<//Gmap_id><Rate>5<//Rate><pictures>None<//pictures><name>Nancy Garcia</name>< Response>

<text>I have been going to Jessica for the last 5 years. She has always taken care of us. She is always friendly and will try to get you an appointment, even if it is last minute. She has very reasonable prices, is next to a little bakery shop, and has a very clean and updated place. I highly recommend!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Date>1564581165777</Date><userid>106725757455804886195<//userid>< Gmap_id>

Bring cash although I she she can also do a bank transfer but cash is king here. No credit cards.< /Review></record>

<review>I work right near Jessica's Salon and am pretty new to San Diego.  It's always hard trying to find a new person to do your hair, especially after 20 years!  My experience was AWESOME!  Jessica and staff are so friendly and knowledgeable.  I got my hair colored, trimmed, and styled.  I honestly have never been so happy walking out of a salon.  THANK YOU!!!<//review>< pics>

I was looking for a place that would be able to trim my hair in layers.

Jessica's Hair & Nail Salon was the closest in the area, and I made an appointment. They were able to squeeze me in on the same day that I called.  While I arrived on time, once I opened the door, I saw the "CASH ONLY" sign and panicked. I had no cash on me.  I asked if I could run to the bank and come back.  They were fine with it.  Unfortunately, my bank was 3 miles away and it was prime traffic time. I didn't come back with the cash until 40-50 minutes later. They still took me in for the haircut fortunately.

Once I sat on the chair, a female staff member prepped my hair. Mid-way through she for some reason couldn't continue, so one of the male staff ended up cutting my hair.  I appreciated his patience and precision. What I didn't appreciate was the remarks made in Vietnamese by the woman, not knowing that I'm Vietnamese too!  I felt like she was a distraction to the guy cutting my hair, and I really could not relax at all.

The haircut was priced around $35, and I left a nice tip for the person cutting my hair.  While the hair cut was decent, I didn't enjoy the overall experience.  This place is CASH ONLY so be prepared.

For now, I'll still continue to search for a hairdresser I can trust with my locks!<//Review>

<text>Been getting my hair cut by Jessica for several years now.  She does a great and consistent job and it’s affordable at $15 for a men’s cut.  I can even drop in without an appointment and not wait long if I dont have a preference on who cuts it.<//text><gmapID>0x80dc0763a281c39b:0xf3320bc423a9974<//gmapID><rating>5< /rating><Name>Jeff Martin</Name>< resp>

< review>
Not worth the haircut, new workers are a bit amateur for the new men’s haircut price ($20). I showed a lady a picture of what I wanted, but actually cut it shorter and it’s really a whole new look that I didn’t want at all. It didn’t resemble the picture at all with length, she really cut it short, so if I were you and I had long hair I wouldn’t go to this place.< /review>

I recommended her to my sister and she went in a couple days later after my first visit and left with a great cut as well. We've both agreed that she's now the only one who can touch our hair.<//Text><UserId.>104138211836870323044< /UserId.><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>I needed to get my hair done today 8/29 and was short on time.  I walked in right at 10 am with no appt. and they took me right away. I loved the service.  I didn't get the stylist name, but he did an awesome job with  my hair and I will be going back.  So glad I found a place close to home that I can walk to.  Oh and place is cash only.  Good note for next time.Thank you guys!</review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<rate>5</rate><Text>For the price, you can get a haircut comparable to the high-end salons. You just need to choose the right person:

Jenny specializes in color and long hair, while Minh is great with shorter/more stylized hair styles. Jessica, the owner,  is the most versatile hair stylist here; she shines the most on her coloring. I highly recommend the place for both men's (~$15) and women's (~$35) haircuts.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80dc0763a281c39b:0xf3320bc423a9974</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Will Pittman runs the best body shop in California. Aside from that he's a remarkable human being who knows how it feels to get in an accident and this is absolute best always to allay fears and provide extraordinary service. He and his entire department are to be applauded. And I must say everyone at the dealership are caring, trustworthy, and Sensational in every respect. I don't want I don't know what more to say other than thank you so much.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Date>1614622100032</Date><Text>I called the dealership as soon as they opened and asked about a particular vehicle, I was transferred to Sergio. Two hours later I was at the Dealership and Sergio met my family out front with what I could assume was a friendly smile (COVID Protocols were top notch). After a brief walk through of the vehicle he gave us the keys for a test drive. We were happy and wanted to purchase the car. Sergio was very easy to work with, friendly to my entire family (kids included) and did not pressure us into anything we did not want to do. The financing went very smooth and again we did not feel pressured to buy anything we did not want, we worked with Joel who was very thorough, worked with us and got us close to our "perfect" payment. I will highly recommend Wheeler Chevrolet for anyone looking at a new vehicle.</Text>< rating>

<Review>This was the best new car buying experience I have ever had. I have bought many cars of the past 30 years. Aaron Snider was awesome, funny, friendly, and personable. I really didn't feel the car salesman pressure when like buying a new car. I didn't get the pressure of buying an extended warranty, which shocked me. I will be back and send all my family and friends. Thanks Wheeler!</Review>< Pics>

We met with Jason today, so he could explain all the new things on the car that we never had never had before lol ,he's wonderful patient and kind especially helpful since we are seniors and not exactly used to all that is available on the cars today. We greatly appreciate his time and thank you Jason.</Text>

<Review>Services were added (rear axle fluid change) and services requested were not completed (transmission fluid and filter change). When calling and explaining what happened everything was blamed on me. Wheeler was not capable of taking any responsibility and in the end i was stuck with the bill and a truck not fully serviced. They have lost most trust and i will never spend another dollar there. I will be sure to tell all my friends and family about my horrid experience with the Wheeler dealership.</Review>< UserId.>

“AWESOME” Sterling Mitchell was polite, professional and knowledgeable about the truck we were looking at. He wasn’t pushy about making the sale but very patient and concerned on making sure he answered all our questions. Would like to also give a thumbs up to Joel Sondrol for his support through this process. We love our Silverado truck and so glad we bought at Wheeler Chevrolet!!! Thanks again!</text>

<review>went and looked at the vehicle 3 different days was told price was $18,999, sticker was placed on car second day.  When I made my purchase it was $1500 more because I did not have a lease, to me this should have been stated somewhere before filling out papers for the sale. The sale price should be the sale price.  Other than that Sterling and Aaron were very kind and helpful.  Thank you.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Why Wheeler held onto my warranty refund for 2 weeks without contacting me is beyond me. But I have it now.

<Review>very unprofessional experience I had at wheeler. I first dropped my vehicle off Thursday 09/03/2020 because my truck has been making a noise while driving after telling me that there was no issues until I persisted on a  drive with the tech and while driving with him he finally heard the noise they informed me I needed to drop it off again to for diagnostic test. I explained I needed to be at work in the morning and would there be someone there to drive me to work. I was reassured someone could take me immediately to work. Today 09/04/2020 I arrive to drop off my truck and waited 30mins for someone to be able to take me to work making me late. Later in the day around 2:00pm I called to check if they figured out what was wrong with my truck, if they where keeping it and if I needed a rental. He talked to the tech and they said they half way figured out what was wrong, but the tech would tell him more when he figured it out completely and that it might be the drive shaft. When I got off work I went over there  to check and my truck was parked on the street with the keys in it! And no one had time to tell me to tell me what was wrong or even come out and explain anything just said they needed parts. So my complaints are not being told what was wrong with my truck- maybe driveshaft ? I work in the automotive industry and know that would be an unsafe vehicle to drive, but no one explained whats exactly wrong and being the only vehicle to fit my family how do I know its safe and drivable. No one really had time to come talk to me? Is my business not important?
My second complaint is parking my vehicle on the street with keys in it? What if it was stolen! I hope thats how they leave there cars. They didn't know when i was coming.<//Review>< Pics>

We drove from Reno and our salesman had the vehicle ready to test drive. We felt no slimy salesman pressure or sales pitch. He let us make up our mind to buy. When discussing the warranty options it was the same , we weren’t pressured to buy more than we wanted.  Great overall experience!<//text>

<review>I am so thankful for my experience with Jason Darby and the team at Wheeler Auto Center. After being treated quite rudely and feeling pressured at another local car dealership, I was a bit apprehensive when I first visited Wheeler. Jason warmly greeted me and I instantly felt at ease about my car buying experience. I not once felt any pressure. Jason was helpful and knowledgeable and he and the staff at Wheeler did a wonderful job! I would recommend them to anyone!!< /review>< pictures>

Service department three weeks they would be passing on servicing our vehicles. The fact that they do not take fleet is a big deal; the big deal is three weeks to say no thank you. Frankly, service management being away on vacation is not a proper excuse, has more than a person who takes of business. Especially when someone told use there are getting everything set up—one star for Wheeler Chevrole. This was after three weeks of service failing call us back.<//review>

If you are looking for a great car at an affordable price then Wheeler Auto Center is the place to go! They have an incredible selection of cars both new and used! The staff is truly incredible! They will work with you to find a car which you both love and can afford! George and Audrey went above and beyond to help me find the perfect car! They are both very knowledgeable and easy to work with! From the moment I walked in they treated me like family and welcomed me in! If you are looking for a phenomenal auto center with a trustworthy staff then look no further!< /Text>

<review>I have worked with Wheeler for years and they were great in the past.  In recent years they have gone down hill in the service department.  The service reps appear to be lacking in knowledge and the customer service is heavily lacking.  After 10 years of working with Wheeler, I will definitely be taking my business elsewhere, which is sad but much needed. I will not be recommending them to anyone anymore.< /review>< gmap_id>

Our experience with Josh Evans in Sales was very pleasant, helpful, and handle our needs in purchasing our Trailblazer. He worked hard for us trying get us the best affordable price. Along with the gentleman (sorry didn't get your name) that directed us toward Josh, thank you for your help. Also not to forget Joel Sondrol  (Finance Manager),  as well is great at his job, no pressure. Thank you. P.S.  With professional like these, employees is what makes, WHEELERS, a good experience that you would what other to experience. Again, thank you. We are so enjoying our Trailblazer.< /Review>

Took my cruze in for an oil change today at wheeler Chevrolet. They broke my window visor that was less then a year old. the service rep came out to let me know what had happened and stated he was going to take care of it for me, then moments later the owners son came over and informed me they wont be responsible for an aftermarket part and he was sorry. He made no attempt at customer service or fixing the problem just a not our problem have a good day. If thats the kinda service your after then wheeler Chevrolet is perfect for you if not i would suggest somewhere else where they attempt to value customers or at least there vehicle's.<//text>

Great overall service. Employees are wonderful and always polite.  Wouldn't go anywhere else.  Wheeler Chevrolet is the place to go.  You can always expect to get the best service and be well taken care of while you wait for your vehicle to be serviced or washed.</Review>

<Review>Worst customer service ever!
Service makes the car worse each time, after 6 failed attempts!
Detail department cannot clean the car after 4 failed attempts.
Finance will not return calls?
Management will not respond to emails or calls.
Most Wheeler staff simply do not care.
During out last visit we tried to escalate an issue & were told that "management does not talk to customers" by the finance department....
FAKE Google review by Carlos Santana is from the Wheeler's own sales department!
Ask around & you will find out what kind of poor reputation Wheeler has overall.
There a couple of great employee's; Jason & Jennifer so kudos to them.<//Review>< Resp>

<text>I took in my company vehicle for a oil leak. They supposibly fixed the oil leak for a very hefty price. After driving the vehicle for 30 miles the oil leak came back with a vengeance. It was alot worse. I take it back. They call me and say its going to cost me $2000 dollars after already paying for a oil leak. We decide to take it to our auto shop guy in Sacramento that is a family friend. He Opened it up and told us the oil pan was left loose and that nothing was wrong with the pan itself he fixed it for $200. DO NOT TRUST THIS PEOPLE. IF THEY FEEL LIKE THEY CAN SUCK MONEY OUT OF YOU. THEY WILL. SOme of their reviews on google also match their employees names. DO not trust their positive reviews.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><user_name>Valeriy Shishkin< /user_name><GmapID>0x809b5344f95dc627:0x7a99856e66c3586b<//GmapID><Resp>None< /Resp>< userid>

Not sure what the bad reviews are about--this is *free parking* for two hours (you know, like on the Monopoly board). How could that not be worth five stars? Sadly, free parking doesn't apply if entering after 5pm--it'll cost you five bucks flat (still less than a beer or your popcorn at the theater). BTW, the large Whole Foods lot is free for customers, and the Ralph's, Target, and Glendon/Trader Joe's lots are free with validation.</text>

<username>Jorge H< /username>< review>
Today I had the horrible experience to lose my key at the office and when I try to ask to the parking responsable that I lost my  key and I have to comeback tomorrow and what is the schedule and the price he started to yelling me accusing me that I was drunk and that’s why I lost my key.

First of all how can he dare just to do a comment about me.

Secondly Even after explain go him that I lost me key he started t say well if it’s loss 18$ this is the cheapes place and if I have any problem next time I should park to other place.

Today is 08/21/19 11:30 pm, please manager check who was this person and talk to him because I hope that if this happen to him someone doesn’t treat him like he did with me.

Even if he doesn’t deserve my respect do something with him, because he was drinking  and mingiling with other man inside the cabin.

Thank you for save your image of those un respectful employees</review>

Cheap parking; best parking bargain near UCLA.  2-hr. FREE parking before 6pm.  After 6pm, $5 flat.  Enough said.  Reason why its cheap is because,the City of LA manages it.< /Text>

Do NOT park here after 5pm. Took me 46 minutes to get out of this garage at 10pm when I got into my car. Took the cars on upper levels over TWO HOURS TO EXIT on a Monday (today). RIDICULOUS! The reason? Because their credit card processing machine is slow.... Stay away!</review>

parking payment is manual, and at times it tales you to get out 20 mintues, cause it slow, so the free 2 hours are less, cause you pass the 2 hrs cause it takes 15 minutes jam inside the building. otherwise its a good public service, but managed poorly.<//text>

Great location for parking in Westwood, you get 2 free hours but then it's like 1.25 every 20mins after.<//review>

If you're going to park your car, this is the place to do it. Hands down top ten parking structures in the Los Angeles area.< /Review>

< Review>
I have been so impressed by the integrity and professionalism of this company.  We went with Solar Maintenance Pros because we had a great experience with them at a previous home.  When we moved out here we knew we wanted them to put solar on our barn.  We had the roof replaced with a standing seam metal roof so that the panels could be clamped in place.  There was a misunderstanding and the installers used a different kind of rail system that required them to drill holes.  We were pretty upset about it.  But Solar Maintenance Pros went above and beyond to make everything right.  They replaced the damaged roof panels and remounted the solar panels with the right kind of clamping rails and made sure that we were satisfied every step of the way.  Dawn was always available by email, text or phone and kept me informed of every step of the process.  When Ryan came out to do the electrical work he patiently explained everything he was doing and made sure to clean up any mess left behind when going in and out of the attic.  Sherene did a great job explaining everything about how to monitor the system.  Everyone I interacted with was friendly, honest and knowledgeable.  I am so thankful we went with Solar Maintenance Pros for this job, and we would recommend them again and again and again.</Review>

<review>Today your crew showed up for the first cleaning of our 38 panels.  They showed up on time, performed the work quickly, efficiently, and without excess noise or disturbance. Thanks for the great job. See the photos from their work. I included one photo to show what the panels looked like before. They did an excellent job. Enjoy the pictures below.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9TXwx9OgTTPkeqP8k0zpuLYWz2nbZkWgEyDnJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuJWwlXfEStQHMslGwWw3A6i2rc0lGo9x-o1OW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEyOf5AoBopqKbY_29lC7mPN5BWC756rkYrkVy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyhJK65PJe6W2tbAWDg5x8gbXfuI8iBpf-q53k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrp-H87FL1lMDHWkn8XSAj1AtDzsGAEu4w3ret=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNX6m1jmNSLkj_o7yCZMRBL1nY1h1nzKrBI6sPe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

<review>The whole process was very easy. Starting with our zoom meeting with our sales man . He was very clear and informative explains the costs, warranties and care of the system. The financing was easy and done quickly. The crew that came to install our solar system did an excellent job! They were polite and informative letting me know when they arrived and the process of installing along with the time frame. They cleaned up after themselves each day.<//review><response>None< /response>< Time>

From start to finish, Solar Maintenance Pros made the process of going solar easy.  They presented a well designed, extremely competitive proposal with zero sales pressure.  They thoroughly
answered all questions and set all expectations for our timeline.  They ended up installing 2 weeks ahead of schedule in the middle of July, which is unheard of.  Their whole team, from the project coordinator to the installers were a pleasure to work with. Couldn’t be happier and will happily recommend Solar Maintenance Pros to family, friends or anyone who will listen!</review>

Our process started in the fall of 2019.  Chuck came by and presented me with Solar Negotiators' proposal.
Chuck's presentation was easily understood, he was able to satisfactorily answer all my questions.  I had decided in favor of Solar Negotiators over the two other competitors I had met with.
Unfortunately I just wasn't quite ready to pull the trigger.  Fast forward to now, the fall of 2020.
My wife had scheduled three contractors to interview.  Chuck was first.  Near the end of his presentation I took my wife aside and asked her, "Do you think we need to see the other two contractors?"  She said, "Nope".
We signed Chuck and Solar Negotiators up and canceled the other two.
In very short order materials were scheduled to arrive, emails for permissions were received, the lead installer came by for a site visit and then the schedule was moved forward, next thing I new it was done.
Very professional, very clean and easy to talk to.
Shareen has just come by to present us with a fully functional system and demonstrate all the internet based and cell phone app based options to monitor all aspects of our system.
In short, Solar Negotiators have got their game down.  Honest, fair and without that "Used car salesmen" type of sales pressure.
I encourage invite you to join my wife and I to become a member of the Solar Negotiators' family!< /Text>

Solar Maintainance Pros did an AWESOME job with the cleaning they did this week. I loved the report they emailed that included before and after photos. The two techs that came to the house texted us to let us know when they would arrive. The communication was excellent on all fronts. We are very pleased.</Review>

Just had my first cleaning with them and I can literally see the difference on the panels and most importantly on my energy produced.

They’re very organized and up on technology. I get calls, text and email reminders prior to appointment. But my favorite is the report they send once cleaning is done with before and after pictures along with a condition report.</review>

I had originally set an appointment for 4/30. The day came and went and when I called them, they said they had 5/14 in their system. But they did show up on 5/14 and everything went without a hitch from there.

This was my first professional cleaning by any company and I would have expected some of the panels to clean up a little better, but that is probably my fault for rinsing them down with tap (hard water) and letting it air dry in the past. Probably what I see are some deposits left behind as a result of these old attempts at cleaning them and not because of the technician's work today.

All minor though, and not complaints. The phone reps have always been very friendly. The technician who showed up was also friendly and professional.

Finished in about an hour (39 panels) and was on his way.< /text>

Solar panels are cleaned but they showed up three days early. Didn’t have time to cancel service because of the local fires. They notified me 15 min in advance before cleaning when they said they they’d do it hours in advance. Wouldn’t use again.< /text>

< review>
The Solar man arrived at exactly 7 AM, the assigned time, and phoned me again at 7:50 with the report on what was done.  Unfortunately, that was still early in the morning for me and I'm not sure I understood what I was told.  I wish they had sent me a followup email to cover what was done and what still needed to be done.   But he was very efficient.< /review>

<Text>Purchased a cleaning/maintenance contract when I added new panels onto my existing system. That was about 3 months ago and unexpectedly SMP was at my home today to do a cleaning and inspection! Didn't think that panels could be all that dirty but I am more than happy to let them clean it right now.   Not expecting too much of a jump in efficiency this time but I will keep an eye on my readings.  I imagine the cleaning difference will be much greater next year when it has more time to get dirty.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Every single employee was dedicated to making our miracle of getting solar...they were with us every step of the way. They shared in our struggles, correction notices, emails, and the excitement of being connected. The entire staff and the special consultants we needed to complete our project have all had professionalism, dedication, and consideration for our special circumstances. Beginning with Jackie, Mike W, Collin, Brian, Mike,  the installation team, inspection team, clean up crew along with Josh B with Cutlass Consultants, and Taylor Designs every person at Solar Maintenance Pros and Solar Negotiators deserve an A + for going above and beyond our expectations!  Thank you.</text>

From my very first phone call the service has been professional and courteous. The day of my service was prompt and professionally completed. The crew was courteous and advised of their arrival and let me know when the job was complete. The price for the service was very competitive.  I would recommend Solar Maintainance to anyone with panels.
Please note my energy levels increase tremendously after my panels were cleaned.< /review>

My husband and I purchased Solar Panels one year ago from Solar Maintenance. Since then they have maintained them, and sent a report after their checks. I was very impressed with the fact that their report included exactly what they did along with photos. They not only cleaned the panels, they checked to make sure they were working properly, and also checked for any roof issues.  It's great to have the confidence that all is operating perfectly! I highly recommend Solar Maintenance Pros!</review>

< Review>
So I was somewhat disappointed with the service I received today.  When I decided to use Solar Maintenance Pros for my panel cleaning I was told the service technicians would take before and after photos of the roof and panels (I was concerned about tile breakage during the service) and would check connections, wiring, inverter, etc.  The service kinda went like this; two technicians arrived at the house, went on the roof, one sprayed the panels the other used a brush.  When they were done one of the technicians knocked on my door and handed me an invoice.  As he walked away I asked about my roof tiles , if any were broke during the service.  He responded there were several cracked tiles to which I responded was odd because about 40 tiles were changed during the solar installation less than a year ago.  I expected for him to offer to show me before and after photos but he never offered.  Also, while I did not expect any issues, I was never told the system looked okay which one would expect if an inspection was a part of the service.  The bottom line is they came out cleaned the panels and left.  If a company claims to do specific things then the client should be advised of the observations, and I would have liked to see the before and after photos of my roof and panels.  Now I have to climb on the roof to look myself.  On a positive note the technicians did showed up on time and gave me a heads up phone call and from what I can see from the ground the panels look much better than before the service.<//Review>

This company has been a Godsend for us.  The installers ( a lease) had left a whole in the roof.  Chloe Fradue held my hand while I hired a lawyer to wind my way around fixing my home and having a clean functioning solar system.  Solar Maintenance Pros cleaned the roof and helped me identify the needs.  Thanks Solar Maintenance Pros!<//text>

I finally decided to get solar and knew I wanted a local company to do the installation.  I spent months researching and finally decided to go with Solar Negotiators (Now Solar Maintenance Pros), as they were local, had great reviews, and the owner was a Veteran, being a Veteran myself this played a big role.  I'll leave names out just to keep things as objective as possible.

I met with my sales representative and planned out my system.  I was paying cash as I didn't want to hassle with yet another loan.  As everyone who goes solar knows, it's a big investment and something that isn't taken lightly.  From this point, I was thoroughly satisfied with the process.

My project got turned over to the service team and I was assigned a service representative to oversee my project and be my point of contact from here on out.  This was February 22, 2019.  From here I was given the checklist and approximate timelines.

The Site Survey went off without any problems.  The plans were submitted and I signed off on it.  A few days later I was told there were problems with my plans and they sent over a second draft for my approval.  I signed the second draft and awaited install day.

Install day came and when I got home I noticed the panels were in the wrong area.  Long story short, the original plans were given to the installers, not the newest approved plans.  After a little back and forth, I think they did a great job on resolving this issue.  Instead of moving the rack, they just added a new rack and gave me 2 free panels to offset the shade issue and as a way to make up for the confusion on their end.

My system went from 4.7kW to 5.2kW.  Therefore it had to go back to the city for approval, which delayed the process.  I'm 62 days into my project; I have panels on my roof, an inverter on my wall, a brand new electrical panel and I'm still getting all my electricity from PG&E.  I'm just waiting to find out what the next step is, I've reached out and haven't got any communication back.

So all this to say the following:  I wish Solar Maintenance Pros did a better job with communication.  Maybe not everyday, but send an email at least every other day with a status, even if it's just "still waiting on the city to approve your project".  I worked in the service industry and I called my customer's everyday to let them know what was going on with their computer, they appreciated the constant communication.  It reassured them and let them know that their computer/project was important.  People want to know what's going on, especially with a project that costs so much.  This is a huge investment, I am by no means wealthy, so this took me a long time to save up for.  I don't like being left out in the dark.</Review>

<text>Solar Maintenance Pros was very professional and did a great job cleaning everything up on our roof and applying critter guard around our panels to keep the pigeons out.  Chloe was extremely easy to work with and very responsive via email which was perfect for me.  Their price was better than 2 other quotes we had received. I am very happy with their work.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

From start to finish, it was smooth and friendly process.  System installation is clean and does not detract from the beauty of our home. The system delivers as promised and our electricity bill has been mitigated.  I recommend Solar Negotiators to anybody seeking to add this capability to their home or business.<//Text>

<Review>Solar Negotiators/Solar Pros is in my opinion the only company to go with for Solar.   They are honest and ethical, and their prices really are the lowest around.  I like that they don't pigeon hole you into a single product and yet you still get the quality hardware and service/installation you'd expect from the very best out there.   (I know, I shopped 9 different solar companies before I selected them).

The maintenance benefit has proven to be great for us too.  They recommend the best times of year to come out and it's nice to have that taken care of in our contract with them.    That's another great time and money saver and frankly is good for your TrueUp too.

I highly recommend them!</Review></record>

I've had multiple transactions with SMP. They're fantastic! I can see that the business is focused on continued improvement in every aspect of their service delivery. I don't know how they could get any better, but somehow they do with each encounter I've had. SNP represents great value - unmatched service coupled with great pricing is a winning formula.</text>

They are very professional and fast. When you buy solar panels you don't think about how you will clean them. For $25 a month you get 24/7 monitoring of your solar system as well as 3 cleanings a year and if there is a problem with your solar panels they come out and fix it for you.
I started on Friday. They came Monday morning and cleaned the panels. I love this company!!!!< /Review>

Great company to work with, mostly because they are super responsive. I had a company who used to come every three months but then they just stopped showing up. I called another company, had an appointment for cleaning, and they never showed and never called. When I emailed Solar Maintenance Pros, I got a call five minutes later. We agreed to cleaning and the paperwork was emailed a few hours later. Reminder email that they were coming, invoice emailed after they were done. All very professional and my panels look great. Happy customer!<//Text>

Daniel and Robyn are excellent customer service representatives. They answer all the questions and concerns I had. They followed up if there were any changes or just to check to see how things are going. And the installers were great too, fast and very efficient they also answer any questions that had during the install, poor guys even installed my panels in the rain that's dedication to make us customers very happy.  All in all I had a very good experience and would definitely recommend them.<//text>

Excellent installation team and great interactions.  Great meeting after installation with system/warranty person.  Original sales person came twice, once to give sales presentation, once to follow up with contract.  He called for payment checks from credit union  immediately after installation, but before I felt all was completed.  Appears to be working correctly, but will have to go by office to confirm if I am deciphering reports correctly.< /Text>

The entire Solar Negotiators and Solar Maintenance Pros team have been amazing. From initial conversations through the final inspection they have communicated so efficiently and graciously. The work crews were quick and truly problem solvers so they could get the job done in a manner that pleased us. We were a bit nervous about how this would look once installed, but the system profile looks amazing. Thank you Solar Maintenance Pros!<//review>

My solar panels are 12 years old installed by another company that unfortunately is no longer in business. I had an issue with one of my inverters and Solar Maintenance Pros came out and diagnosed my problem and I'm very pleased with them. The technician that came to my house was very pleasant to work with. I would recommend Solar Maintenance Pros to anybody who needs repairs or maintenance on their panels.< /review>

Could have been better.  The re-roof wasn't complete when they left. Had to have them come back to install the flashing. Haven't received my antenna that should have been installed during the install. Now I'm just waiting for my orientation appointment.</Review>

<Text>My experience was fanatic, not to mention very easy.  I sent my PG&E statements over to Mike, he looked at my annual usage and determined the system size I would need. After that we sat down to look at the options, I chose the system I wanted to go with and we did the paperwork. It was literally that easy.

Shortly after the installation while I was traveling for work we had an unrelated  electrical issue, but being out of town I had no way to diagnose the issue.  To try and get the power working for my wife and kids I called and asked if Solar Maintenance Pros could come check the panel, which was upgraded during install.  They came right out and even ended up changing a breaker to a higher amperage rating.

Fast forward a year and a half and I got a call that Solar Maintenance Pros were checking systems and I had 2 panel not producing.  I don't check my systems output often enough to catch things like that but again, they came out and fixed the problem immediately.

I couldn't be happier with my system or experience with both companies!< /Text><Name>Matt Cholakian<//Name>< Gmap_id>

My panels have been installed and they look great I am now currently waiting for the connection. Having said that my experience has been overall positive one with Solar Maintenance company. Connecting with them is simple and they will answer all your questions. I will look forward to having solar for a long time to come and I would do it all over again with no regrets.</text>

I had Solar negotiators install my solar system back in 2017. Back then Solar negotiators was separate company from Solar Maintanace Pro. But now that they are one company the review goes to both of them.

Back then when installing my solar system which included AC unit, we ran into some issues, but they resolved the issues and was still skeptical to leave a good review; instead I waited for their customer support on the first issue I had which is my inverter stopped working with the light on fault. Sure enough after calling them, Theresa. W was very professional she called me and emailed me and had informed all they way, they couldn’t solve it remotely so they sent the technician and solved the problem.

Now I can say thank you for standing behind your job and reward you with 5 stars review, and really recommend this company. As I said I don’t give 5 stars easily as I rely on reviews myself.< /Review>

I was ecstatic seeing the clean panels. They looked like they had JUST been installed! I had the service done on two houses and am extremely happy to say the panels look gtrat and the performance on both systems have better productivity. The technicians left a note for troubleshooting that didn't even involve the panels (gutters) which i greatly appreciated.</review>

Well its been a couple months but it was great. We called last week about getting a sooner cleaning than we scheduled. We had no idea how busy you are. On our end, we are trying to have your service to clean the panels, but trying to balance the number of cleanings (and which months) to make the service value balance any loss/gain of power and NEM charges. So far, ...great service by pros.</review>

< Review>
This was a long researched project for us. We spent over 2 years researching & interviewing multiple solar installers. The price ranges from Sunrun, Tesla, etc were huge. Some were twice the price of Solar Negotiators!!

Our project was unique but not impossible and we needed some special things done for optimal production of our ground mount solar panels.

Again and again when we found the panels we wanted, the installation was too expensive. Then when we found an affordable installer he wanted use cheap solar panels or had bad reviews or wasn't local.

So here is how we made our decision.
Ask these questions:

How are their reviews on google, yelp, etc?
Are they a local company?
Are they knowledgeable on solar?
Do they come out and inspect the install site or use google earth?
How many installations have they done?
How often do they clean the panels?
What kind of warranty do they provide for loss production on the panels?

Happy to say Solar Negotiators checked all the boxes. We could not be happier with our experience with the install and customer service. They love what they do and it shows in their work and attention to detail.

I would highly recommend them to any of my closest friends.

**Remember that 2019 is the last year of the full 30% Fed Rebate**.

<Review>Solar Maintenance  Pros cleans the solar panels at my church. Collin and Bart showed up on time. I went out to meet them. They were very friendly and explained the service and the need. I was not told about cleaning the panels when I bought my home as they were already installed so it had been over 3 years. They badly needed to be cleaned.
The workers
were efficient and wore safety equipment which impressed me. I don't think they were here more than 1/2 hour setting up, cleaning panels, and clean up.
I highly recommend this company.

Solar Maintenance provided exceptional service! They cleaned my solar panels and did an amazing job. They took their time and performed a  thorough cleaning of each panel. I have a aluminum panel roof so it's very difficult to walk on but they were very careful and did not damage any part of the roof. Thank you Solar Maintenance Pros!<//text>

Great Service!  Awesome work done.  The guys came in and did their job, cleaned up everything (we had a real pigeon mess).  Pigeons are gone and everything is clean. We couldn’t be happier. Will definitely use this company in the future for cleaning our panels.  Very reasonably priced.< /text>

Great experience! The young man that serviced our solar was very considerate of our vehicles and patio furniture,  asking and making sure it was all okay to get wet. He could have just done his job but I feel that he went above and beyond.  Thank you!< /Text>

<review>Had our solar panels cleaned. Our experience with Solar Maintenance Pros was excellent from the time we called to schedule an appointment to the tech who preformed the service cleaning. This was our first time having our panels cleaned and plan to use Solar Maintenance Pros for all my future service cleanings. Highly recommend.< /review>< pics>

<review>Always pleasant to work with Solar Maintenance Pros.  Panel cleanings to keep our system optimized and gutter cleaning to keep the leaves in check.  Everything is as it should be on our roof, and they regularly communicate with us before service visits.  Highly recommend.< /review><date>1549915065999< /date>< gmap_id>

Cameron came out and cleaned our solar panels. He did a great job. After they were clean we noticed a big improvement in the energy the panels produce.He even found that one of our panels was not functioning properly. It was repaired under warranty. I highly recommend getting your solar panels cleaned and inspected regularly!!!< /text>

I recently added more solar panels to my existing system and after getting quotes from several solar companies I went with Solar Maintenance Pros . They were very professional and detailed with their
quote and there were no suprises . The installation went without any problems and on time. They overall provided a great value for their service.I also signed up for their solar panel cleaning service after getting several quotes , again they provided a gteat values for this service. I would definitely recommend this company to anyone who is think about getting a solar panel system.< /Text>

I had a huge pigeon population gathering and nesting underneath my panels causing noise, feathers, and bird poop everywhere. When I contacted them about my problem, RJ was very professional and polite. He gave me a competitive quote and we set up a date. The crew came out and installed everything in about 2 hours and didn't bother me at all. I received an email invoice shortly after and paid online easily with a point by point evaluation of my entire system! I highly recommend Solar Maintenance Pros for all my solar needs. They also come out twice a year to clean my panels. I wish I had gone with their parent company 'Solar Negotiators' for when I first decided to purchase solar. It would have saved me tons of money and stress. They are on it!</Text><time>1534731142862<//time><pics>None</pics><rate>5< /rate><userid>115238956530349244180</userid><resp>None</resp>< username>

They are awesome! Very professional, clean and courteous!  We live in the country and it’s extremely dusty due to horses on the ranch,  so we just added the monthly service and they do a great job, we have a 12k system with 34 panels!</text>

These guys are terrific--- both in the field and in the office! We have a 48-panel ground-mount installation on our property east of Clovis, a very dusty location. The service from these folks has always been exceptional: available, responsive like a whiplash, professional, and super friendly. AND they even brought their own water for the cleanings during the worst of the drought so they wouldn't drain my well. Now that's service!<//text>

<review>So far I have had 2 free cleanings on my new panels and both times we've had scheduling problems meaning they give a time that they'll be here and they're HOURS late screwing up my whole day. I got a free cleaning because of the 1st scheduling problem that I will be using soon. I was told that when they're here they're supposed to inspect the solar unit which both times they never did.
UPDATE: Chloe called to resolve gave me 3 free scheduled cleaning. They were on-time and did a good job. Appreciate their effort to make things right!< /review>< pics>

We do not require the homeowner to be present while the cleanings are performed because they are scheduled in a time window, as we don't want to disrupt the client's day. We are so sorry that you were effected by this, and we'd like to offer you a free service when we speak with you. With professional panel cleanings, a visual inspection is performed of the whole system and a service report card is left behind with the customer upon completion detailing any issues if they are found. If you didn't receive one of these reports, please let us know. Thank you for your feedback, we look forward to speaking with you."}< /response><user_name>Maggie Magoo< /user_name>< Rate>

Solar Maintenance Pros have been very professional to work with. They were flexible when scheduling and did a great job with the panel cleaning. They did the cleaning while we were not at home and I couldn’t tell that they were there. Nothing was out of place and they cleaned up after themselves.<//review>

Solar Maintenance Pros came right in after my panels were put up and installed my critter guard before any pigeons could make a home and cleaned them as well making sure I was getting full useage right out of the gate.  So far I am extremely happy.<//Review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Text>Didn't show up for the scheduled 1-3pm cleaning appointment. Not even a courtesy call to save me the inconvenience of wasting an afternoon waiting. Understanding mishaps like this can occur I'd hoped to get the situation cleared up the next morning. It took two calls and waiting more than 4 hours to get the response that they had run out of time on my appointed day. Granted at that point I did get a weak almost apology. I was not impressed. In fact I was very disappointed with the lack of professionalism displayed overall . The only reason for the 2 stars was that when the rescheduled appointment was met the cleaning man was polite and efficient.<//Text>< user_id>

Couldn't be happier!  Our service tech was friendly, thorough, and quick at his job.  Easy and good experience all the way around, so we signed up for their 3-4 month service.< /Text>

Management does not care for their employees at all. Watched a guy worked without break until he had heat stroke (vomiting, cramps, disoriented). And I've never seen any of their employees using their safety gear. I will never call them cuz I don't want anyone falling to their death at my house.< /review>

They show up without having to call them.  Hassle free work.  only thing i would like to see is maybe a photo once the work is complete.  I know they are getting it done because I see them.  I would just like to see the completed work.</Text>

<review>Solar Maintenance Pro is awesome!!!! We had our panels cleaned and part of the cleaning service was an overall inspection of our system.  It was because of the inspection we found out our inverter was not working properly. If you are wanting a company who really cares for you and your solar investment, Solar Maintenance Pro is the ray of sunshine you need. 😊< /review>< Pictures>

The extra care Solar Maintennace Pros provides (solar panel cleaning for life and free system monitoring for two years) is another factor that makes using the company even more attractive.  Anyone new to solar and contemplating solar installation could not pick a better company than Solar Negotiators to get the job done!< /text>

Shopped many solar companies and Solar Negotiators stood out. Chuck explained everything without any pressure at all. Just went live and looking forward to avoiding the PG&E rate increases.<//Review>

I had braced myself for the worst because I've heard people's leaking roof horror stories, but I was dead wrong! The crew was fast and friendly - their attention to detail was a huge cherry on top. The solar system looks good on my roof and I couldn't be any happier!</review>

I just purchased a solar system through the sister company Solar Negotiators and they delivered as promised and the installed Kuykendall Solar manned our 30 panel job with 4 guys and knocked it out in a day. Very pleased with the way this all worked. Thanks Chris and Robyn!<//review>

Solar Maintenance Pros worked side by side with Energy Concepts to get my solar installed and operational. We had some challenges due to the cold and the frost on my roof but they kept us updated every step of the way. We love our system and everyone we worked with (Solar Negotiators, Energy Concepts, and Solar Maintenance Pro’s) was great!!!  We will be calling Solar Maintenance Pro’s in the future for panel cleaning and system checkup<//Review>
