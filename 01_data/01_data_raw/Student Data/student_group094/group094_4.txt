<review>Stopped by to have a battery replaced, which took less than 2 minutes. Very friendly service and the price of $7.99+ tax is a good deal.

His type of expertise is hard to find. He replaced the "crystal" on an old-style, wrist watch, the kind that is self-winding with no electronics. 17 Jewels. I've known Fred since his repair service was located at the Rite Aid 10 years ago. He told me he does the repairs for many of the jewelry stores all over the bay area. Very friendly and relaxed.</review>< Pics>

Fantastic, honest professional!  My 46 year old Seiko watch had stopped working, and I had Fred do a cleaning, at a very reasonable price, as other repair shops refused to merely clean it, insisting I needed an outrageously priced overhaul.  After getting the watch back from Fred, it was still not working properly, and Fred insisted on ordering a couple of parts that he felt were worn out and which were difficult to find considering the age of the watch, and no doubt expensive.  He repaired it properly, and refused to let me pay for the extra time and parts involved.  I can heartily recommend Fred, a very personable and honest individual who takes pride in his profession, and does excellent work.</Text>

He originally quoted around $500, which is inline with what other people quoted me. But by some magic, when he took it apart for cleaning, he found the piece that was broken and happened to have an exact match lying around! So for the price of cleaning I have a beautiful working watch.
This is absolutely the place to go for watch repair.</Review>< Response>

I came here because I needed to replace a broken crown and stem (i.e. the dial that adjusts the minute hand) on my watch. Fred, the owner, was helpful and friendly. He took a minute to examine the broken piece, we talked about our respective holiday travels, and he politely told me that he could have it fixed in less than 30 min for $29. I accepted, and will call on Fred in the future for any watch-related issues.< /review>

<review>Ok so I had to get my battery replaced and when I got there he was out to lunch.  I waited about 10 min but when he showed up he apologized and thanked me for waiting.  He guessed that I needed a quick fix, took the watch talked with me a bit and boom a few minutes (if that) later he gave me my watch.  Said it was like $7 and I was just amazed.  No upsell, no phony talk.  He's just a straight up hardworking, nice guy that knows how to treat his customers and what they want he delivers. What a nice, professional and genuine guy.

Thanks Fred..

Highly recommend him.< /review><user_id>102662895307627441812</user_id><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

<Review>Was very impressed with the chorizo burrito on the breakfast menu, served all day. For only $7.25 you get two eggs scrambled with chorizo, tomatoes, and onions. Wrapped in a flour tortilla with bacon. Servers came by the table several times to refill my ice tea. Can't wait to come back and try some other items on the menu 8)<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFhLtypCt867j66XAhrKkwy9auKPpgBq5-LoIP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

< Review>
Just about 3 weeks ago, I went there, like I’ve been for years, even before it was la piñata. I think it was named El Encantó. Now surprisingly, El Rey, sucks, from food taste to service and drinks. Novato has too many Mexican restaurants to be doing this, ADIÓS!!!
BTW, I missed Chevys!<//Review>

<Review>Have come here for years.  This time, the service was very bad.  Had to wait for silverware.   The combination fajita and shrimp platter's had little flavor and the waitress had very poor service.  Will think twice before coming back.  They weren't even busy.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Very tasty Mexican food with some unique dishes. I had the shrimp and spinach enchiladas tonight and they were delicious. The cozuelas are also a good choice...kind of a stew.

It's definitely worth visiting for the food because the location is kind of bleh...inside a parking lot next to the DMV and Goodwill. Not exactly picturesque views!< /Review>< date>

< Review>
So much better when the cousins owned this place.  Less grease and a delightful menu but now they rely on a diverse tequila offering as their brand distinction.  For me, "gracias, pero mi abuela cocinaba mejor".<//Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Why haven’t I come here sooner???  So happy with nail trim and gland expression.  And such a great price!!  Debbie and the other young lady (didn’t catch her name!) put my little guy at ease during these stressful procedures.  Nails look clean cut and uniform, and I’m taking her word that the glands are empty. 😆 Definitely coming back for a full spa treatment soon!< /review>< Pictures>

Hit or miss on operating hrs and phone #. Sometimes she’s open, sometimes she’s not. Appointments are kept, so try it that way. She’s the owner and operator of her salon. I’ve been coming here for 7 years and she seldom has assistance, always does a great job, works quick and swift, never freaks my dogs out or keeps them hanging around and her prices are best in town.
Yeah, the phone number changes & sometimes there’s no one inside.  She commutes from TJ & gets stuck in a line sometimes, but she does a great job for cheap, so it evens out. Make an appointment like everywhere else you would go to in San Diego.

My dogs have been med-large, long hair working dogs.<//Text>

< Review>
I Got an appointment last week for my dog for Monday at 3:00pm. I was very excited because I read good reviews, and my only day off is Monday and normally all groomers that I found in San Diego do not work on Mondays. I arrived with my dog on time and it was closed. No one called me to cancel the appointment, (and they took my phone number)  I am very dissapointed they didn't respect my time. I have lot of errands and things to do on Mondays, so I  have to take my dog back home and start over again searching for a groomer.<//Review>

Thank you Bebby For your kindness and understanding today. Thank you for the fantastic job you did on Rocky. Thank you for taking Rocky on short notice. Thank you for the discount and paying it forward. My Aunt was so happy with the job you did on Rocky. She said he looked like a "puppy" again. That he looked fabulous. Thank you again.< /review>

<review>I volunteered at this place, in the food pantry and the clinic. This organization and the staff who run it are passionate, dedicated and kind. This place supports a network within the homeless community and  works to support each and every person they work with, from.food to medical access. They are a credit to our community and an example of good leadership.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

It has been quite some time since I came here. But I have known people who've gone through it since. And it seems like it is still such a great place. Kind staff, good feeling atmosphere,  helpful and make you feel like a human being no matter what your circumstances are.<//text>

Showers, toiletries, food bank and referrals to other NFP Org. in and around San Rafael/Marin County.   But, they can only do so much with limited resources and case management.  Good stop for traveler's/backpackers just passing through on their way to somewhere else.<//Text>

This place has the worst of the absolute worst  case workers employed who do absolutely nothing to help myself and many other people who ask for help and never get it ..
I'm talking about Colin , and David
David was my case worker and he was so incompetent and useless and did nothing to help me ..wow!! The systemic bias here is rampant..who ever is on charge here needs to fire everyone and clean house< /Review>

The Ritter Center is a non profit organization that ostensibley serves the low income, and homeless population of Marin County and environs with a food pantry, day services; showers, needed clothing, and the  medical arts; physical and mental health. They also have a staff of advocates who are knowledgeable in community and other resources such as jobs and housing and particulars. Ritter has been a bedrock of the community for over 40 years, and continues to do, what can be described as, the daily nitty gritty of human services. They are a hearty group, and seemingly dedicated to their mission . Of course, my understanding of them is subjective, and by no means do I represent them. More can be learned by visiting their website, which readers must get for themselves.<//text>

<Text>I use to love this store. I like it however I don't love it anymore. If you don't know how much stuff cost they will over charge you. Also the lady will tell you one price however when you go pay the guy would charge you a different price. My daughter went to the store to get some stuff for me and they charged my bank card twice also they over charge her because I was in the store earlier and got the same thing and they charged her $10 more. Yes they did fix the issue so I didn't really think about it to much however my other daughter went in the yesterday to get two packs(4x) of hair that cost $8.99 and so edge control that cost $5.99 and they charged her $36 around $10 more smh. I had to call the store so they can fix This mistake too. This isn't the only time they have over charged my daughter's however it wasn't this much.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

{'time': 1614572638279, 'text': "Compared to which beauty supply? we have the cheapest price in Inland Empire. our price margin is lower than all the beauty supply around us. I don't think you  regularly shop at beauty supplies and know the prices to say we're pricy. you should goto Sally's, ulta or sephora and see their prices some of their stuff is twice what it cost at our store. If you're buying your supplies from Walmart which is the only place I can think of that's cheaper, they buy in bulk 10,000 pieces at a time. we buy 12 or 24 at a time so we can't compete with huge chains. why are you being so destructive to small business. If we didn't pride ourselves in our low price I wouldn't even reply but you're making false statement and hurting our business without knowing the facts. you can either prove that we're pricer than other beauty supplies with another beauty supply receipt or please don't come back to the store. you're really hurting our business with false information. you are not welcome to the store."}<//resp>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>This beauty supply is pretty much, a one stop shop for all your styling and beauty needs. I frequent this location because they carry a product that I live by and offer it in colors I have literally seen no place else. I travel 30 minutes or more because of the variety alone. The mom and pop type couple that operate the store are always so welcoming and helpful. I've never had a bad visit. Only issue I've faced as of yet was trying to decide upon what colors to put together!<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

We have the cheapest prices in Inland Empire, This is totally false statement, no one can beat our price because of the volume and the relationships we have with the wholesalers. We been in business for over 30 years. Please tell me which beauty supply is cheaper, its impossible.  Please don't make false claims.you can bring your receipt from that beauty supply and prove to us that you got your products cheaper. there's no way any of the beauty supplies around us is cheaper. 3 to 8 dollars that doesn't even make sense. you cant do the math. clearly you never had retail experience. Sorry to anyone that reads this if this comes off rude, but we run an honest family business for 30 years and we don't over charge our partrons in fact we have less of a profit margin than all the beauty supply stores in Inland Empire. its not like our prices are the same with other store we're so much cheaper.\n\nIf you think its cheaper somewhere else please go there, I guarantee you're paying more there."}< /Resp>

A big selection of everything, but I couldn't look around to decide what I wanted, I had to be told what everyone else likes instead of me making my own decisions, then the Chinese lady manager tells me to leave just because I went outside to the car and came back.  "Come back another time."  Don't worry.  I won't.  Insulted, controlled, manipulated, and kicked out.  I didn't need to waste my gas for this s***.< /review>

My daughter and I came into this store, looking to get hair extensions. The first thing we noticed was that there were no employees to assist us so we just started to walk around unknowingly where to start. We do not know anything about hair extensions, and would’ve appreciated some assistance. When we noticed some extensions that we liked, we started to place our hair next the packaged hair to compare and match our hair colors, and that’s when a lady loudly demanded not to open any packages (which is something we weren’t doing or planning on doing). Another few minutes later, in front of her other customers, she loudly shouted, “Don’t mess it up! Get me next time! You’re messing it up!” After that, we simply left the store, shocked from the completely unwelcoming, impolite atmosphere. Instead, we went to Bobo’s Beauty Supply in Rancho Cucamonga. In there, we were immediately greeted and assisted by kind, welcoming employees. If you’re looking for excellent service, skip this place and go to Bobo’s!<//Review>

Customer service here is abysmal. I’ve been a regular at this store for a couple years because of their huge selection but the couple who own the store are incredibly nasty, rude, and (dare I say) racist, so I will be taking my business elsewhere. During my most recent visit, the lady followed me and my mother around the store eyeing us as if we were stealing, and she was rude and dismissive when we asked for help. The man at checkout was also very dry and rude. Unbelievable considering we shop here quite frequently and have been nothing but polite and decent. I understand that shoplifting is an issue but regardless, this is absolutely no way to treat paying customers. The store itself is dismal, uncomfortably stuffy and hot, and way overcrowded with products, many of which (hair products, certain makeup, lotions/shea butters) seem expired, dried out, and/or old. Yes the selection is good, but not worth the prices or the blatantly disrespectful treatment.<//text>

This lady tells her man to follow the customers inside the store
She treats you like you've stolen from her before. Only been to this store a handful of times in all honesty i loved their wide selection of products and prices but the treatment received is enough for me to stop supporting this shop.<//review>

They're rude and over price, it seems as though prices increase monthly... owners follow you on every aisle. This store is cluttered if you're not careful can trip or easily knock products over, and not everything is labeled with organization or priced for ease of shopping.</Review>

They have so many products in my opionion you have to kind of know what you want. If you don't the lady joy I believe is her name she will help you. And she will tell you the truth. If that color hair doesn't look good on you she will tell you. I also like that there is a salon in back where you can get the hair put in. I've never used it but that's a great idea. I got hair,, earrings, a pair of leggings , and edge control plus a bra and panties for under $60! The only reason I gave them a 3 is because of all their products they have.</review>< Pictures>

Ms.Moore who braids hair in this salon did my braid literally 6 days ago and they started falling off, I called her to see what she can do as a business person, and in response I got yelling and a horrible customer experience. Never would suggest anyone to invest $80+ here.< /Text>

This place has everything you’ll need a little pricey but have Everything. Now that’s out of the way these people are VERY RUDE. They treat you like your stealing if you spend more than 5 min there. My first experience there was with my 7 yr old son who even caught the scandalous vibe towards us I came a hr before closing looking for weaving hair in the aisle the husband and wife kept screaming we are about to close what do you want, I said idk I’m still looking the husband rushed to the aisle started rushing through the hair throwing it at my face we have this this pick something we about to close or jus I said I know that he throws his hand up and said well just leave come back tomorrow. My son said mom why are they treating us like that I was so hurt when I left the store I just sat in the car for 5 min just to gather myself. VERY RACIST AND PUSHY PEOPLE.</review>

This place has many products, dyes and hair not to mention the whole NYX collection, but the owners need to work on their customer service and management. Their treatment and attitude towards their employees is saddening. I only go because their employee and staff is awesome they are helpful! This bussiness only remains by the grace of God lol< /text>

<Review>Okay so I have to say, mostly the comments in regards to  the staff being rude, and rushing and especially being followed around as if I were a thief.   But I have to say it's not about race, she follows EVERYONE.  She followed me around, and I'm a 40+  white lady. So it is true shes rude but equally rude to ALL!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Come here when I need something quick. Agree with a previous post this lady does have issues she just sees me often so doesn't give me much trouble. Once I was in here however, went to the back of the aisle to look at the braiding hair and she's yelling at me can I help you about 6 or 7 times. I said I'm fine a few times but she kept saying can i help you until another patron had to jump in and say, she said she is fine. Hate coming to places like this where Asians don't mind taking our money but want to act like we are going to steal from them. Rarely come into this place. Just go to crown on waterman and olive or tigis in rialto</Review>

The woman at this store is very rude and disrespectful! I felt like she should go to jail for hate crime, she followed me around the whole store while I was looking and never asked if I needed help when I got closer to the door she asked me if I needed help like I was going to steal a pony tail. She's racist and I was actually debating on buying an $80 wig from her and being a future loyal customer but forget that ! And when I was asking her if she thought I was gonna steal something and why she didn't ask me why I needed help earlier and she just said bye ! Bye! Byee! Like that's some way to treat someone who puts money in your pocket.</text>

<review>This is a difficult review to put to paper. I ordered a Blackbird, paid for it, and took delivery 9 months later. The delays were out of the control of Bolton Ebikes. I understand that. The bike quality is very (very) high, and the price is amazing for the quality received. However... customer service is unsatisfactory for a modern company. They have a policy of scheduled phone calls only. It was a week away to the first available call-slot when I had difficulty assembling my new bike. Their primary way to communicate is via email. This meant that when I ran into a problem putting my bike together, I had to stop, write an email and wait (until the next day). Their answer was helpful, but did NOT fix the problem.
When you prepay for a $2,500.00 bike and wait months for it to arrive, you should expect a more timely response to customer communications. I am sure Kyle has a host of reasons why they do not have phone based customer service, but from the customer point-of-view, his reasons do not matter. It is not just an irritant to the customer, but a deal killer to any further ebike orders from THIS customer.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x809b70df450411c7:0x6287dce72ac9e88d<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>I've bought a few things from Bolton Ebikes now. Brakes, Rad Rover upgrade kit, and better motor. Totally woke up my bike and made it 10x more fun. Great value (even with the exchange rate and shipping to Canada). Also, their support is fantastic. Needed a bit of help and they were right on it. Thanks guys.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
Received used/damaged item & poor Customer Service:
Ordered the RadRover upgrade controller from Bolton Ebikes on June 3rd with a given backorder July fulfillment time. I just received the controller on August 24th. First disappointment. Opened the box to discover I received what looks to be a used controller and LCD screen as the screens film had been reapplied and the mounting bracket for the controller was bent; looked to have been ripped off. I immediately proceeded to take pictures of this damage, then emailed Bolton regarding these concerns. It's been nearly a week now with no response. We have emailed all the contacts made available yet no response.

Follow-up to Bolton's response:
I can confirm Bolton received our email regarding our concerns. As an IT company, we utilize an appliance that intercepts, records,  and monitors ALL email communications sent and received. I just once again verified there is no email traffic incoming from Bolton since the Bolton auto responder email on Monday; confirming you had received ours.

Additionally, the shipping box was not damaged in the least so leaves the possibility of repackaging by the carrier. Please locate our emails and reply. I'm confident there is simply a communication problem but from our vantage point, it's not on our end. Thank you for any assistance you can provide and will update this review once we have a mutually fair outcome.

Lastly,  as a customer, I'm confident a phone number was included at time of order At this point, a call would be appreciated. The name for the order is the same. As a business owner myself, something I would have immediately pursued post a negative review of any kind. Thank you, Shawn

9/18/2020 Update. Nearly a month now and still no response.  Considering the lack of response, I proceeded to install the controller -- IT DOES NOT WORK! I was able to power on the unit and found all the default setting had been modified so it indeed had been used at least once before.  Guess I'm forced to contact the BBB next, then go from there.< /Review>

Kyle took time from his day to educate my wife and myself about e bikes. After his instruction we decided to purchase two of the Bolton Blackbirds even though they aren't scheduled for delivery until September. This after much research on my part, Kyle made things much clearer. So I know I've purchased the best e bike in my price range.  Thank you Bolton  E Bikes< /text>

I ordered the wrong size bike from Bolton , it was a Sunday when I sent a frantic email to Bolton customer service rep Jessica and to my amazement she responded that day saying she had changed the order to the correct size. This was my first purchase with Bolton and won’t be the last. Thank you Jessica.<//text>

Not impressed with this company. I ordered a RADPOWER UPGRADE KIT -
They delivered it 2 months late. And it does not fit my Rad Runner as promised.  So installing it will be very difficult!  Need to be an engineer! And no bike shops can help either. So I ended up with a $300 White Elephant.  Not happy with Bolton.<//Review>

<text>Kyle is knowledgeable. He knows a lot of stuff about ebikes. His prices are fair. I test drove Foxbat, 20inch folding, new blackbird. New blackbird is very powerful with a torque sensor. Foxbat is also good. Great quality ebikes from a very professional owner. Don’t forget to watch his YouTube videos. Fantastic experience overall.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I can't find a phone number anywhere or an email address.  This seems the only way to contact you.  Are you still in business?  My email is whitehead361@gmail.com.  Please contact me about your Foxbat bike.  I'm getting nervous about your customer service and viability. Thanks.</text>

Kyle's YouTube videos brought me to BOLTON EBIKES.  I'm 71 years old and wanted Transportation that I could hang on a rack behind my Jeep or motor home. I drove to their shop and test drove one of the FoxBat 1,000 watt models. Kyle and the guys were extremely helpful and informative. I bought the E-bike and several options to make the bike comfortable for me. The components used are much better than E-bikes costing much more. I'll post again once I know how the service is. Michael

Okay, I said I'd do a follow-up once I  knew more about Bolton Ebikes from a service perspective. I had the Foxbat for a couple of weeks and tried various changes in handlebar position and seat positions. Nothing worked for me to ride for more than a couple of miles. I'm a big guy and the rider position put all my upper body mass squarely on my wrists and that was painful!
Kyle at Bolton Ebikes invited me to try the Cheetah cruiser style ebike.  I rode it a little over 2 miles around their shop and was completely sold on the Cheetah! Kyle gave me a full refund towards the purchase of the Cheetah after I had offered $500 deduction because I had ridden the Foxbat for a couple of weeks (I believed that to be fair). So, Bolton Ebikes showed me that customer satisfaction is VERY IMPORTANT to them.
By the way, the very next day I took the Cheetah for a 10 mile enjoyable ride. I wouldn't recommend any place other than Bolton Ebikes for you ebike purchase.
Great products, great prices, and great service!

By the way, for other senior citizens, the Cheetah is the best ebike on the planet. Order one, ride one, and you'll be very pleased that you did!

Customer service is terrible at Bolton ebikes. I tried to cancel the bike order after I read I had to schedule an appointment to talk to someone on the phone. The  owner kyle assured me I wouldn't have to do that. Not true. Ive called, emailed, text messages ignored for 4 days to get warranty parts with no luck. I'm not scheduling an appointment 4 days out to talk on the phone. I have the 1000w fat tire less than 150 miles. its broke down 2 times. Just loved walking home. The  chain broke and did a lot of damage. I ended up having to buy my parts from another bike shop. Its easier  when you can talk to someone  on the phone.hope this helps someone not make the same mistake I did.  Good luck< /Text>

Kyle from Bolton Ebikes will bend over backwards to make sure you are satisfied with your purchase. Due to a post office issue, he replaced a lost part not just once, but twice.  You can't get much better than that!
He's also very helpful and knowledgeable, he will help out anyone ,even if they are not a customer. Bolton Ebikes, highly recommended!<//text>

I did a lot of research before my purchase and had decided on a set of criteria I was looking for in an ebike. The Dillenger Hunter fit my needs, especially with the price from Bolton Ebikes, Except I wasn’t thrilled with the 10 amp hour battery capacity but I checked with Jessica at Bolton and she told me that additional OEM batteries for the bike were available. That sealed the deal for me.

A big thank you to Bolton Ebikes for their awesome assistance and support. They are a terrific asset for anyone considering buying an ebike.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Astoundingly good customer service!  I purchased an eKit upgrade 9 months ago and it took me a while to put everything together.  It worked brilliantly for a day, but then I must have damaged something because it stopped the next.  They walked me through a simple diagnosis to make sure what to send then sent me an entire replacement kit so I could try swapping out pieces and see what wasn't working.  I found the defective part, got it replaced, and was able to make the ride that weekend I was getting the bike together for.  And they asked for nothing other than for me to return the parts I wasn't using.  Since then everything has worked great and I have a new commute option.  Thank you so much!< /Text>

Bought Two Sets of Hydraulic Brakes from Kyle and couldn't be happier. Quick Delivery and Extra Advice regarding install makes this my go to place for my Ebike Upgrades.  Oh, and if your not rockin Hydraulics your missing the best upgrade for Fast Ebikes.< /text>

I enjoy shopping at Marshalls because of their selection and prices. I have purchased lamps, luggage, travel accessories, housewares, beauty products, gourmet foods, stationary items, etc. I check the clearance aisle carefully. It may look messy, but I have found many treasures there. One of my favorite sections is the Gourmet Kitchen. It gives me the chance to try  items without having to pay brand name prices. I discovered a great selection of salt free / low salt spice blends. There is something for everyone here. My recommendation is take your time and enjoy the treasure hunt.<//text>

Love the store, love the selections, love the price....but you need patience and time to go through the items. It's not always organized, so expect to pick through the racks. I find great items on sales rack always.The staffs are friendly and helpful when they are not busy....and if you can find them. Lol<//review>

Have to admit, our hopes were not high when we went shopping for bathing suits, but boy were we surprised!  Score! I bought 2 and my husband bought three! Marshalls came through for us both after the major department stores had already failed us, and at a fraction of the price. 5 bathing suits for under $100! All name brands. Unbelievable!  Going to begin at Marshalls the next time I shop. Get exactly what you want and at an incredibly low price.< /text>

I always find something to take home. They have really great skin care products for women and especially some wonderful shoes both casual and dressy.</Review>

Good service. I was returning something. The multi-checker system works like a well oiled machine, that is , efficient. I love to get misc.. pretty bowls and mugs here. They are reduced because there isn't a full set I say, "So what." The kids break alot of  dishes anyway, stupid to buy a full nice set.<//Text>

<text>Staff was uneccessarily rude... Threatened to call the sherrifs department because my friend lost his keys in the store and they just wanted to shove him out so they could lock up and get the hell out there. Not a single employee (managers included) even offered to to help locate his keys. just plain atrocious "customer service".< /text>< user>

Worst Marshalls employees ever. I have shopped at this location for years and never had a problem until now. Paid 49.99 for a pet fountain. The fountain plug got really hot and smelled of burning plastic when I tried to use it. Went back to return it and they wanted to give me 18.99 for it. I refused because I would rather dispute it with my credit card. A partial refund for a broken fountain no thx. Beware of this Marshalls< /Review>

<Review>So happy with the employees here. Always so helpful and attentive to the customers. Lost my keys to my storage and Robert was kind enough to wait for me to get there right before closing so I could get a new lock and get into my storage. Maintainence guy also very helpful and patient with helping me out and waiting a few minutes for me to get there before closing. Thank you both<//Review>< pictures>

On a day when it was going bad for me everywhere I turned. You guys were exactly what you said you were on your advertisement. The gentleman was very courteous he explained everything step by step. And unlike other places I went to there was no hidden cost or find print as they say I would recommend you guys to all my friends and family keep up the good work</Review>

Jose is about the nicest person you will ever meet.  Knowledgeable, helpful, kind and trust worthy.  The place is super clean.  And knowing someone lives right there, is a good reason to not worry.  Thank you, Jose.  See you soon.</text>

VERY VERY pleased with. Gilroy self storage depot.... Jose ( the manager on duty) is ABSOLUTELY wonderful ! He made me feel very welcome upon arrival. I didn’t have any trouble with online reservation. BRAND NEW  storage units, very clean, Very safe,  free move in/ out truck  that really makes moving so much easier, very reasonable pricing , cheapest prices in all of gilroy, morgan hill, and hollister.(and I called every storage company in all three cities) overall the best experience !⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</Review>

Ordered Beef & Lamb Shawarma Wrap, Chicken Shawarma Platter, and Pita Hub Combo Platter via DoorDash.

The Beef & Lamb Shawarma Wrap is fantastic: tastes great and fulfilling.

The two platters are horrible: bland taste and burnt meat.<//Review>

<review>I only get the Kebab plate with hummus, rice, and salad. It’s one of my go-to meals in the area.

4 stars because it’s the only thing I’ve tried that I really like and the rest are so-so, including all salads and drinks.

Maybe it’s pricey just because they’re located right along El Camino? Anyway, hummus.<//review></record>

<name>Ivonne Gonzalez<//name><text>Not good at all!!! We order the gyro beef and lamb,  and when we got the order it wasn't a gyro it was a burrito! Meet was dry,  normally a gyro is open face with onions, tomatoes,  lettuce  and yogurt sauce.   What this place give us was dry meet rap in a grill tortilla, this junk wasn't even a burrito!! humus has no flavor,  the dolmas was bad. And is not cheap!! $70.00 Who show this guys to make something like this!! Mediterranean food is an art! And in this place ruined everything!! Destroyed Mediterranean food! This place should be ashamed of what they done to Mediterranean cuisine!< /text>< Resp>

Best shawarma I've ever had. This place actually fills it up with meat bot like others where they fill it up with lettuce. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family. 5 stars<//text>

I might have ordered the wrong thing. I got the combo, and the chicken wasn't very good, although the gyro meet was good, as was the falafel. The staff was friendly too. I am going to give it another shot! 😁</Review>

I got the lamb kabob plate and let me tell you, it satisfied my craving. It was much better than expected, so juicy and seasoned to perfection. There hummus was also delicious, different than I’ve had at other Mediterranean places, a good difference. The plate came with grilled veggies, a salad and rice. The sauces that came with it really set it off. I cleared my plate and it was a pretty hefty serving. I’ll be back soon, maybe today lol. This place is it!<//Text>< resp>

Vegetarian Platter is delicious.  The Falafel were crispy and yummy along with the typical Hummus, Babaganous, Dolma and Tabhoule all very flavorful, my girl got a Beef Shawrma we were both disappointed it had nothing but fatty beef in a Shwarma  Will definitely return for the veggie plater.<//Review>

I had to update my review because today I have received the worst customer service by the guy whose name is Samir if I am not mistaken. He was laughing and texting with someone while taking order from me. And plus he even didn't call out when my order was ready he just gestured like I am someone below him. I don't wear the nicest clothes but treating human beings like that (notice I am not saying customers) is just a shame. And food wasn't good. Meat wasn't grilled good enough. I am definitely not visiting this place for a while<//Review>

Google says they close at 8:30, but I get there at 6:10 and they’re already closed and the people inside didn’t even pay me no mind when I knocked and asked them why they’re closed so early. That’s not how you run a business</text>

<Time>1622141327503< /Time><Review>They do a good job but every time I've come (and I tried 3x) they have hidden fees. And I used to come here all the time. I bring my friends (extra business for them). So this is very disappointing. First it was tanning. Their board said $8 and she charged me $10, saying her board wasn't updated. Then she upcharged my friend for her nails,  again saying the price listed on her board was not correct. And today they had a hidden fee that they didn't tell me about to take off my gel polish. I asked 2x before getting my nails done how much it would be, and then at the end the total was more than they told me it would be. Its just gotten ridiculous. 1x is understandable, but I won't be coming back after this happening 3x< /Review><Rate>2</Rate>< Response>

< Review>
Today I came in to the nail spot that was recommended to me and let me just say NEVER AGAIN!!! One major thing I notice is cleanliness the tools and scrubs they use are not sanitized, Also their attitude uncalled for they are rude and will man handle you while doing your nails and after you tell them they start complaining in their language, last but not least they are taking breaks in between doing nails to eat and it stinks< /Review>

<Text>This was a great experience. Also possibly the only nail salon open until 8pm. My two sisters and I came in around 7 and they agreed to do all of our pedicures. My girl was amazing: she removed all the dead skin off my feet, massaged my legs for such a long time (best massage ever), and really spent her time taking care of all the details. My toes came out looking so beautiful. Thank you so much. My girl also was very knowleable and helpful with the products they had and the best part was she wasn’t forceful in selling me the merchandise. She simply explained and said let me know.  I wish I caught her name. Ladies who were working Wednesday, 12/5/18 around 7pm thank you all so much! We all love our nail art!! 🥰< /Text>< Pictures>

This place was absolutely wonderful. The ladies here where very nice about letting me and my two sisters get pedicures around 630 when they close at 8. I understand it’s difficult to fit three people in so close to closing time but they did a wonderful job. Massage with every single thing they did. It was very soothing and relaxing. The place was reasonably priced and the work they did was so good! Will definitely be coming back.< /Review>

Nice place, the prices are a little more than I imagined and the manager lady HATES when you pay in card. I went there so my mom and I can get mani pedis for her birthday, I don't just CARRY almost $200.00 in my wallet. 🙄🙄< /Review>

At first I was little apprehensive when I first came to this place...it looked dusty inside so it mad me question the sanitation and cleanliness. However the customer service is 5 starts and they even did my mani and pedi close to closing time on a Sunday when they were all going to a special event. They did a great job. This is one of my favorite places in the area. 5 STARS!!!!<//review>

<Review>Great prices and service. You got to see to believe! A place you must go at least once a 1 time. I PROMISE you will never regret it! Come and get your nails done. I take my girlfriend and her nails are absolutely stunning ever time. Get the gel nails and you will be impressed, the price is great and the styles are very good! Just like Hollywood at 1/10 the price. And they do it all from nails to tanning! It's amazing place is great can't write enough!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x809ada3495437745:0x7224cf3e4390c6de</GmapID></record>

owner in the first chair touch you.. she rushes like crazy and will have you leave with uneven nails because she dosen't check to see if they are even with the opposite hand. I also asked for a different color for my pedicure but did not get that due to her rushing to get done. she is even in a rush when the place is empty I have only had her so my nails a few times and each time she rushed through it every other nail tech will have you right and take time to give you quality work.<//review>< Pics>

Love this salon.  They always do a great job and their prices are very reasonable. I would say cheaper than most places and they do a really good job. I came in one time on a Friday looking to get my hair dyed and cut last minute and at first they said the stylist was just about to be on her way out, so I decided to get my eyebrows waxed and while i waited for the girl who does the waxing to become available, I was making a few calls to local salons to see if anyone was able to fit me in last minute for a cut and color and nobody had any spots available that day, and the ladies at this salon overheard me making the calls and hearing that i wasn't able to find anyone so they were able to accommodate me last minute anyways even though the hair stylist was already on her way out she ended up staying and doing the cut and color for me which took about 3-4hours and she did an amazing job. I definitely recommend this salon.</review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>I don’t want to leave even one star, but I need to let you know about this Horrible place. The employees in this location don’t write down the timing of the appointments for their customers, then what is the meaning of scheduling appointments MORONS😡😡 and their incompetency will make you really disappointed. The can’t speak English very well , so you get confused while talking to them , and need to demonstrate each and every word in order to describe what you want. They charge a lot , but the sad part is  you don’t receive a satisfactory service which makes you regret. They charged me twice because they told me my credit card kept coming declined, so I paid in cash , but thankfully I use my online banking , so I caught them . I called , but one of the employees told me no English , and hung up . I called again ,so this time I asked for Linda the manager, but she couldn’t explain it to me in English, and also mad that we didn’t charge you twice. But unfortunately, online banking doesn’t lie . I was in huge trouble with my bank because I trusted them and didn’t ask for a POP (proof of payment) which I should have asked it after paying with cash my mistake😢😢. Bad customer service, unprofessional employees, zero hygiene, so why waste your time and money. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE 😡😡 I won’t recommend it at all period.< /text>< Pictures>

It's only been 2 days and my nail Polish is coming off. they charge me $4 extra for a shape that I don't even have. I was watching them do my nails and it was such a cheap process. Now i know why they charge so cheap because they don't last that long. I  had to go somewhere else to get my nails fixed i hate this place such a disappointment.</Review>

I have tried different nail salons and always ended up being upset. But these girls at this salon do a excellent job. All the ladies in there do a awesome job. Trust me! The two girls that have done my nails and the names I can remember is Linda (owner) and Na are wonderful. I've had two other girls do my nails but can't remeber their names. But again they all can do nails well. Their prices are cheap I believe its $22 for a full and $15 for a fill. I trust this salon because I know they will always to a goo job.< /Text>

Love this salon. They are a full service salon and offer everything from hair and nails to waxing, and even tanning. And the ladies here a super nice and they do an amazing job. I got a gel manicure and pedicure and it's been over 3 weeks and the gel hasn't chipped off at all. If it wasn't for the nails being grown out, the mani & pedi both still look good.</review>

<Review>I would like to start with the appreciation for the late appointment. Although two women on anything cosmetic is unfortunate. Exspecialy when they don't discuss the details. Like sharp square shape or oval square  shape. I'm a sharp square type of girl. I have been getting my nails done for 15 years so I know what I like on my hands. PLEASE START LISTENING to requests, as well as instructions. Over charged for the full set gel polish or took her tip off top???? Idk? Pictures coming soon.< /Review></record>

<Review>After being a client for some time and a loyal supporter for Elegant Nails, the owner Linda, and her new venture with her two sons, Endulge Massage. Both my husband and I average 150 hours of work between the two of us, therefore treating ourselves to a pedicure or massage or both can be very relaxing and stress relieving. For far too long we dismissed impolite treatment and unprofessional behavior by Linda, the owner, and she has demonstrated her disregard, lack of social EQ, basic customer service and lack of respect, especially when it comes to frequent and repeat clients who have referred several other clients. She is rude, unprofessional and completely disrespectful. The last straw was being rudely brow beaten by her two sons because for being late to an appointment. My husband and I went back and checked the weeks prior and had realized not only had we spent hundreds of dollars but had averaged 25% gratuity each time. It seemed apparent that the inexperience, ego, and complete void of customer service basic have still yet to be learned. It made what is supposed to be a relaxing and rejuvenating experience the complete opposite. I would not recommend spending your money here when there are several other options in the greater area.<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>Took a client through the drive-thru who wanted to go there. I just got a soda. I've eaten at Popeye's before I like their chicken the breading is a little bit too thick imo but the meat is good and red beans and rice is a great dish. Also like the use of cayenne, my favorite spice and the most useful of medicinal herbs. I see they have a flounder sandwich now.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

This location is on point hiding from me... I never knew this one existed. It was yet another Popeyes that the "new" (now famous) chicken sandwich built. Congrats to my hometown Popeyes made big nationwide.</Text>

<Text>DO NOT go to this location. Never once do they ever get my order right. And this last and final time, they asked me to pull around to the front, where I waited. I watched the 8 cars behind me drive off with their food, and all I had gotten was a 5 piece tender. I went in after 20 minutes and turned out they had forgot about me. Quick to take my money but not quick to get my order. Manager said they were short on cooks as an excuse, but that's obviously not the case when everyone else is getting their orders. This location is a complete joke.<//Text>< Pics>

This one is tough to review because the food that we ordered that was in stock was delicious.  The problem was they were out of 3 of the items I attempted to order, spicy chicken strips, beignets, & ranch dipping sauce.  No silverware was provided for the side order either, we had to go back in to ask for that.</review>

Pretty good deals using their mobile app in store if you have the ability to use a card like I did. The app just lets you show the four digit code to the cashier the type it in and you get the same pricing. So download the app for deals to save some money</Text>

First time trying their chicken. It was DELICIOUS. Although the shrimps I did not like either they weren't seasoned well or cooked well. I got stomach ache after eating them. But the chicken is the best.< /Text>

<Review>Sorry the sandwich was not cooked thoroughly. The chicken was raw in middle. Sandwich did not taste good. I love popeyes and I always get my same combo At every location I visit. I'm giving 4 stars as I'm sure it's a honest mistake. But can not give five for that reason here.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I saw an employee walk behind the counter without a mask and proceed to serve him self with some lemonade with an already used cup, from which he was drinking from. (He was on break)
During this pandemic,  this is totally unsafe. People are asymptomatic. It is really irresponsible not having protocols at this restaurant chain. There was a manager present,  who probably saw this..   but said nothing. Plus the cashier was rude... she literally threw forks on the counter top,  while i had my hand extended to grab them... They were 2 other customers in the restaurant that saw this. we all looked at etchother.</Text>

<text>Food tasted and smelled funny, first they gave me the Cole slaw without a fork, then for some reason their fountain drink was not working so they only had lemonade and a nasty "sweet" tea that tasted horrible, like they just add a bunch or sugar to the hot tea, now I have some stomachache and I can know were I got it from, honestly I wanted to give it a tried to Popeyes again but now definitely is out of the list for sure.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Review>The new spicy chicken sandwich was soo frickin' amazingly delicious..down side was that no one could go inside because of the Wuhan shutdown and only the drive thru was available..not to mention it was also around lunch time so the wait was obnoxiously long..like 40-50 minutes.  No joke!  I was hungry too so maybe that played a factor but I want one or two more.  The fries weren't great..kinda soggy..they gotta do better on those..step it up Popeyes!</Review></record>

Not only did I have to wait 15 min for chicken that should already be prepared. They were completely out of soda and they had no syrups for them in the back. Your choices were Hawaiian Punch, Diet Coke, sweet tea. No sign up letting you know this before hand and the night before I came here and they were completely out of bone in chicken.< /text>

Worst customer service ever. I will never buy from popeyes again because of this store. They got my honey chiken order wrong and after i came back they just put honey sauces.  $3 difference in price just for sauce. Then the frozen lemonade tasted like rust. Its the taste you get when the frozen mix is not fresh. They must have saved it from the ni before or they never clean the machine daily like they suppse to do. They never answer the phone so i had to drive back to complain.</review>

Went to the Popeyes on magnolia and la Palma bought a family pack ghost pepper chicken wings and you know everything else that goes with it got it home it was terrible the breading was so thick I'm thinking they breaded it like three different times I don't know we've been into a ghost wing I literally bit the bone in half and the bone was black the bone had no chicken hardly at all on it just breading lots of breading I love Popeye's Chicken but man I don't know and then after that it was bathroom time we didn't eat much thank God</Review>

Deceitful employees substitute wings for legs and thighs. 5 out of 8 pieces of chicken were wings on my meal. That cost me $22! Plus we waited for over 15 minutes for our food.</Review>

<text>Waited in the drive-thru for 30 minutes (the line was to the street). Upon arriving to order, I was told they didn't have any chicken but spicy. My kid won't eat spicy so this wasn't going to work. I asked how long for regular chicken but was told they had none. When I got to the window, I explained that I had waited 30 minutes and when I finally made it to the speaker, the cars were still lined up to the street so they would be waiting 30 minutes too. I asked that the manager go outside and inform those in line of the chicken situation. These things happen, but the only way to deal with them appropriately is to keep your customers informed so they don't waste their time like I did. The cashier didn't care. I've been a manager at a chicken place. This isn't how you treat your customers when facing this kind of situation. I waited in front of the restaurant for 5 minutes to see if the manager would fo the right thing and inform their customers. They didn't. Terrible, horrible way to conduct business. Have the guts to give bad news up front. That I would have respected. Won't be going back.<//text><user>101861784991857447259<//user><user_name>J P<//user_name>< GmapID>

To be fair I'll say that I'm not a big fried chicken eater. I tried the chicken tenders and they weren't bad. In fact, I believe that with the right dipping sauce they could be very good. I tried the Bold BBQ and the Buffalo sauces. They weren't bad, but I tired of the  Buffalo sauce rather quickly and the BBQ, though tasty, wasn't satisfying enough to make the whole dish an inspired item for me. I also tried the side dishes, red beans and rice (good stuff), as well as the jambalaya (not bad for fast food).<//Text>

The place is clean. At about 2:45, not a lot of customers.  Walk right up to the order counter. Order taken. Wait about 5 minutes for takeout.  Got home and  found my order missing the tender strips and the popcorn shrimps are just  the crumbled of their leftovers. They have enough staffs to not make these kinds of mistakes. I am giving a one star because of the cleanliness.< /text>

I don't come here that often but every time I do its super slow, also they run out of chicken some how. Its the closest one near my pad so I pretty much have no choice but to come here when I'm wanting to, which is why I hardly come here.<//Review>

<Review>Just left this location and honestly the girl working the drive thru was EXTREMELY rude. She was probably mad that bun on her head was too tight and was causing a headache. Anyways she was very impatient and short while my father was trying to talk to her asking if we could make separate orders. After initially saying they'd make the exception for us, she backtracked (with her voice raised) and said they would not be able to do it (???). When my dad asked for a knife she handed him a bag and when he asked again for a knife she said "we don't have those here" and walked away. Rude for no reason smh.

Incase she forgot we're in the middle of a pandemic so we have to wear face masks. If you can't hear what a customer is saying then you still need to be professional when asking them to repeat themselves. I worked in fast food and I had never, no matter how frustrated, talked to a customer or dismissed them like she did. I will drive the extra 10 miles to a different location next time. They need to put their staff through better training and the managers also need to be held accountable because how are you going to have someone with a stank attitude work upfront?</Review><time>1593315536367< /time>< Name>

<text>They cashier, I think his name is Thomas, was very nice and polite, but the other girl not too much.  After waiting for my food, she forgot my 7 biscuits.  Not big deal to me, but it was for my wife. So I called and Jackie apologized and will give them to me today.

Really good food. I ordered for 5 and nobody got sick :)<//text>< date>

To start with, they have limited items on the menu compare to their other outlets. Whatever is on their menu, they will have something out of stock every time I go there, either chicken tenders or coleslaw or mashed potato or something. One day you won't get honey mustard the other day you won't get ranch. I keep heading there because it is close to where I live. I have no idea how this outlet is surviving.<//Text>

Well, the front entrance was slippery from the moisture outside their entrance doors so I almost slipped. A outdoors rug could have prevented the slippery issue. The service was great. The food was great.< /Text>

I found a hair in my chicken... A long black hair that definitely didn’t belong to me. I tried ordering the new sandwich that Popeye’s was raving about all over twitter since they said it was available nationally, but they said they apparently don’t have them at this location yet... that’s fine I’ll just order something else. The order was wrong since I ordered chicken tenders but got thighs and legs. I went home because I didn’t want to go back and correct them, and that’s when I found the hair. I once went there and they said they were out of chicken. How do you run out of chicken when it’s practically the number one thing you sell? I’ve given this place so many opportunities to get better and hoped that they were just having bad days, but this is consistently poor service. This place is poorly managed. It shouldn’t be that terrible considering it’s a relatively new location. I’m definitely going elsewhere for food.<//text>

I dare anyone to go and say that they actually have all items on the menu available.   It hasn't occurred since they opened.  I thought perhaps because I go after 8 pm.  So I went yesterday at 11:30 am.  Same thing.  Very frustrating.< /Text>

I have gone for the last 2 weeks on 3 different occasions around 9:00pm-9:15pm and they never have chicken tenders available they only have bone in chicken. I am done going to this location and will go elsewhere from now on. I asked the person in the drive thru when they stop selling chicken tenders and they said whenever they run out. I asked since they close at 10pm why would they not have chicken to sell other than bone in chicken?? Person was like yeah that's  just the way it is. Just ridiculous!<//Text>

This is our favorite location for Popeyes Kitchen.  The employees are always attentive and friendly.  The chicken/sides and biscuits are always hot and fresh.<//review>

<Text>Chicken sandwich is super overrated! Best part about it. It a big piece. Young man working register seemed very unhappy to be working. Felt like he was super annoyed when taking my order. Told him have a good day. He just looked at me like F U. Had to cleN my table because it was a mess. Trash was also overflowing.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

I placed my order and I requested my order be divided into 4 boxes. When I received my order it was in 1 box instead of 4 boxes I questioned it and they just handed me 3 empty boxes and said you can divide it up the way you want it. There's other Popeyes to get my chicken fix.< /Review>

Second,  horrible service.  They constantly run out of chicken, the staff is really rude and the eating area is dirty, trash cans are always full. The drink station has a dirty wet towel smell and no one has even considered cleaning the place. The Bathroom are so bad, You are better off using a gas station bathroom.

There is no manager to talk with and if you get anyone that can hold a conversation,  they could care less.

Very, very, very poor customer service</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<Text>I do love some spicy chicken. I love Popeyes extra spicy thighs. Not too thrilled with their french fries. Wish they had a regular french fry option. I do like their mac and cheese better because it's thicker version then KFC. I also love to get the chicken strip tenders and get their barbecue sauce which is also spicy and dunk away! So spicy and delicious I love it.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

I love Popeye's and have been craving it. So I picked it up on my way home tonight. I was sad when they were out of butter for my biscuit but even sadder when I got home opened my side and saw it only half full of slaw. Is that normal or am I remembering wrong? I thought it should be at least mostly full.<//text>

<Text>Popeyes just isn't the same, they're frequently running out of chickenI don't know if it's the franchise owners are the actual company but Popeye's shouldn't ever run out of chicken especially the sandwiches and or side orders.
The parking lot is pretty big very accessible and they have a drive thru. It's a very clean place inside and it's a good place to sit down and eat.</Text>< Pics>

<review>I'd  give it 0 if I could. They always run out of chicken. So you can't order literally anything. The sides seem to also run out fairly early, always double check your order 9/10 times your sides will be wrong,  they wont tell you, and just give you whatever they want. Most of the staff is unprofessional and unhelpful. I am thankful for one young lady who went out of her way to help me fix my order, while the rest were in the drive thru huddled, talking with their friends.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80dd297e6bb57c37:0x375e047c907062cc< /Gmap_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures><time>1582695584768</time>< userid>

Well it took forever to get through the drive thru line and when we got home with our meals the green beans were only half full in the container. One of the drinks was only partially filled and the pieces of chicken in both the meals were not correct. One had a breast, wing and 2 legs the other had a breast, thigh and 2 legs. This Popeyes location has a bad rap of being slow and screwing up orders. Wish there was a better one close.< /review>

Quick service, be mindful of the cars trying to leave in the parking lot if you are in the drive thru. It's a compact parking lot so be aware of the vehicles around you.</review>

Went into the restaurant, Ordered mild chicken nuggets and 2 thighs to go. Specifically asked for my order to be fresh. Told them I don't mind waiting. The employee told me they just made some fresh ones. Got my order, came home, they gave me a thigh and a leg instead of two thighs plus my nuggets were barely warm, not hot or fresh whatsoever. Later that day called the restaurant, explained the situation. Talked to Issac the manager who not only acted very professional and friendly, but also helped me resolve the situation. Very impressed. Awesome job, hope all restaurants have a manager like Issac who go above and beyond for their customers.< /review>

I love the new, black eyed peas. I had the popcorn shrimp, Cole slaw. I thought you
had, fried okra. Clean store, manager/employees, very courteous. I will eat at
this location/other Popeyes, more often

<Text>Worst service we ever had eating anywhere. We went in to order our food was never greeted had wait over ten minutes to even get someone to come care enough to take our order. Said there is a long wait with her bad attitude. We order to get home and one the meals didn’t even have its side so we paid for it to not get it. This is the worst Popeyes ever. FYI to the Popeyes works there is a thing called customer service you all should learn to give it a try or not work there.<//Text>< pictures>

I got there at 945 took my order and said their system went down, they wouldn't take cash either? Seems like they just wanted to go home because they literally helped the car in front of me. Really bothered me.</Text>

Really good... Nice people.  l always get dark meat but the legs are so small I just ask for 2 thighs now.  I think it's expensive so I don't go very often.  For $3 more you can get an entire meal including soup,  salad,  and dessert at Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant.<//Text>

I went through drive thru waited a little bit finally they took my  order. I ordered 12 piece family family pack. Got to window waited 5 minutes to receive order. Can someone tell me why they don't automatically put napkins in the bag. For Pete's sake that was really annoying. Greasy hands calls for napkins or something to wipe your hands on. I've ordered here plenty of times. Food is always good but they never give you napkins...geez Oh yeah don't try to call them ever because they never answer I guess they are too busy  forgetting to put napkins in the bag to answer the phone.</Text>

Service was crazy slow. The manager was taking orders with absolutly zero amount of a rush or urgency to take care of the long line (line out the door) of customers. 1st they forgot an important part of my order so I had to wait for them to get the second half ready and the chicken was in no way anything I would call "fresh", but i was already home so we choked it down. Will not return to this Popeys.< /review>

If the menu item saris 12 strips or chicken for the same price, you should be able to get 6 pieces of chicken and 6 strips, but the said is against policy. Stupid policy.. It's the same price! They also skimp on the sauces and put sweet relish in the coleslaw, yuck.<//text>

<text>Had a small issue with our food and wanted to come back and give them 5 stars. Specifically for the actions and problem solving of a manager named Isaac, give this guy a raise. When faced with an issue that his coworkers did not make the order to a type that I asked for. He reassured me that there will be some training going on in the future so that it doesn't happen again. Very professional, great manager, amazing problem solver and communicator.<//text>< Name>

Was my family's favorite place to eat fried chicken! Who knew asking for ketchup/sauces to go along with 12 piece family combo required dirty looks from the store manager and I'm sure the worker got yelled at for doing his job. Yeah no thanks we meant it we weren't coming back to eat. You didn't need to stare into my car and give my family dirty looks. You sir suck as a manager.</Review>

Popeye's foods have great flavor, but it lacks variety. I was visiting often went they had the smoked chicken, but it was for a limited time.

I'm giving Popeyes 3 stars because of all its meat is mostly chicken and they are breaded. My nutritionist recommends avoiding all breaded meats.

I hope Popeye’s introduce new items to its menu and upgrades the one available.< /review>

< Review>
Service was crazy slow. The manager was taking orders with absolutly zero amount of a rush or urgency to take care of the long line (line out the door) of customers. 1st they forgot an important part of my order so I had to wait for them to get the second half ready and the chicken was in no way anything I would call "fresh", but i was already home so we choked it down. Will not return to this Popeys.<//Review>

I went through drive thru waited a little bit finally they took my  order. I ordered 12 piece family family pack. Got to window waited 5 minutes to receive order. Can someone tell me why they don't automatically put napkins in the bag. For Pete's sake that was really annoying. Greasy hands calls for napkins or something to wipe your hands on. I've ordered here plenty of times. Food is always good but they never give you napkins...geez Oh yeah don't try to call them ever because they never answer I guess they are too busy  forgetting to put napkins in the bag to answer the phone.< /Review>

<Review>I will give 2 stars for the food. The service sucks everytime I go. I have been maybe 6 times for the food. The restaurant is always out of random things like ketchup and Coke. Today was my limit. 2 cars in front of me. 20 minute wait to get my food. I ordered very simple. 4 mild tenders. 1 large fry. 1 kids meal. My wait at the window after a 10 minute wait was another10 minutes. I was given the wrong total almost 2 times my meal cost. I questioned. The kid was confused. Then he gives me an amount less than what it was when I ordered. I questioned again and apparently now the kids meal was not on my order. Anyway.. the food is decent but this particular store really needs some change.< /Review>< Pics>

Had to drive back and go in the stire vecause we got apple instead of thw pumkin pie twice . It turns out they all look the same no difference in packaging or anything. Still did not get out pumkin cheese pie. Which was the only reason for ordering pie in the first place.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

We used the drive thru a few minutes ago. We requested no thighs in our eight piece order, we were told no. We explained that we had made substitutions many time before. We were than told "f you".  We will not go back.</review>

<text>This establishment is horrible. No customer service whatsoever. The place is ran by Teens, literally. Seen the guy walk into the restroom and back out with his phone on hand back into the kitchen. No attention to orders as they are usually wrong. Very slow service. Been there a few times and twice went about 40min before close and they will deny you service even tho their "business" hours are until 10pm. They start cleaning up an hour before closing at 10pm so do not show up wasting your time within the last hour.</text>< Pics>

<review>Here's the rundown: location, environment, service, and food.

The new Popeyes' on those street has been a haven for everyone that loves the chickens because the location has become convenient. The design is very modern, it looks fresh to the eyes with the popping colors. The service is quick and easy: the cashiers and the general staff are friendly and approachable; and they complete your business very well.

The food is plain lovable; there's always room to try the new things they serve, because there's hardly space for disappointment!<//review>< Pictures>

Some days, workers are slow with chicken. Rare times, they are immature... In the sense of having airpods on their ears while preparing food behind the counter, still technically working, 10mins before their break.< /Text>

Popeye's foods have great flavor, but it lacks variety. I was visiting often went they had the smoked chicken, but it was for a limited time.

I'm giving Popeyes 3 stars because of all its meat is mostly chicken and they are breaded. My nutritionist recommends avoiding all breaded meats.

I hope Popeye’s introduce new items to its menu and upgrades the one available.</Text>

Went today, very busy but they were on top of it! Went through the drive thru and employee taking the order and at the window were extremely nice. The gentleman (Isaac) was extremely helpful and nice. Thanks for the help with the Apple pie!  So glad to finally have a Popeyes close.< /Review>

I guess I went during the chicken sandwich craze. They didn't have anything left... Biscuits with no honey. Tenders with no dipping sauce. And didn't even find out that the tenders were mild (ordered spicey) until I got back to the hotel.<//Review>

The chicken was great I ordered a couple of the Tuesday specials and I can get four pieces of chicken and get out of there for under $5 yep well you can't do that if you go half mile up the road for a half mile down the road and eat at the kernelstheir chickens good but the pieces are not as big and the prices are astronomical compared to the two piece special on Tuesdays at Popeye's Chicken so I really enjoy going there at least once a week maybe three times a month</text>

<text>I went for the new chicken sandwich because my friend wanted to. And right when they opened and I asked for it they said it will be a 1 hour wait because they forgot to prepare them. Then laughed and said sorry in very sarcastic and demeaning way. Not only with me and my friend did they do this but with the other customers too.< /text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Secret to ordering.
Their spicy chicken and the creole gravy taste kinda sooty. Get the mild & order a breast ala carte, add on mashed potatoes - no gravy. That is a 4 star meal but I'm giving only 3 because the set menu is what most people order and that choice isnt very good.</Text>

Whether it's sauces or literally every side except fries and coleslaw, or a bunch of sodas are out of syrup. It's hard to actually go in and get what you want.

<Review>Can be hit or miss on freshness, prices are higher than other locations in the area, they don't accept most of their own coupons as this franchise location does not participate, and they don't keep advertised specials very long, ie, to major tv ads ran two weeks only here, and prices went back up fast. Go to the location on Beach or the one on Katella. 2nd visit the dining area is trashed and dirty.<//Review>< resp>

<Text>Ordered a 6 piece spicy chicken tenders and all tenders were so hard like they been sitting out for a while, I ordered through drive thru and live 10min drive away, so I noticed as I got home. Didn't bother to go back since I was hungry, but at least I tried the place and hopefully if I ever go back, I'm given Hot fresh tenders.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I normally love Popeyes and I know this facility has cheaper prices than another location nearby but the service was slow for a drive thru and that is because they sent the Drive Thru cashier out twice to the parking lot with orders. I think someone else in the store should run orders if they are behind rather than making more cust wait for her to return from outside< /Review>

If u ain't come to THIS Popeye's are you even looking for good chicken? My bro Tony always offers service with a smile and greasy fingers. Honestly I come here like twice a week, got me all broke but it's worth it.

<rating>1</rating><Text>I am very disappointed in the portion of food I received today. I paid $9.69 for a 2 piece platter that comes with a drink. I received the smallest drumstick it looks like it came off a pigeon! Then they put a wing in there. Uh typical two piece at KFC or Jolliebee is leg and thigh. The biscuit was way small as well as the sides which were not even half way full. If this is the serving size fine then charge 5$Bucks! But to pay $9.69 for hot wing size portion? No thanks. Guess I'll just have to give my business to company that values my hard earned dollar. I included my pics vs their advertisement.<//Text>< Pics>

Great chicken, ran out of thighs, but the person who took my order was kind enough to compensate me with a few extra nugs.</Review>

<Text>There spicy chicken is delicious! Their sweet tea is on point. I haven't tried all the sides but the Mac & cheese, mashed potatoes & gravy are tasty. The drive thru at this location is wacky. They should have wrapped it around the parking lot instead of running it through the middle. When it gets busy the drive thru blocks the parked cars from getting out. Customer service has been good so far.</Text>< Pics>

Brand new place!  So, it's really clean.  It's in a small shopping center, but, the parking lot is ok.   The spicy chicken is the best!< /text>

I'm giving 1 star because my visit this time was terrible because of Alexes .she is very mean and rude with customers. I ordered 4 PCS compo and I found a quill in one of them .I asked her to change it.she was nervous she took the food in bad way and through away this piece on the counter and picked up another one and through it in my plate .then I asked for a barbecue sauce. She was impatient and picked one and through it in the plate as she did before with the food .I will not go again to this branch. This girl spoiled my night .<//Text>

Wanted to get strips but they had only buffalo and cocktail, every single other sauce was out. So we decided to get just a 4pc so I wouldn't need sauce. Then I'm told they're out of fries which is the only side I normally get. They then said they were also out of green beans. The biscuits were super salty and tasted off. They also messed up our meal. I probably won't be going back there for a while.</Text>

< Review>
Today I went to the Popeye's on magnolia and la palma ,I love Popeye's I'd go almost everyday to the one by my job on hazard and beach this the first time I go to this one didn't even know there was one here,I ordered popcorn shrimp platter the shrimp had it's tail still on,there not suppose to have any shell or tails on them this the first place that I've gone too that has it like that the sprite tasted like alka seltzer and water ,the chicken strips I got my daughter from there had blood on them we dumped the food out waist of 22 dollars ,I rather take that 15 mile drive and go to my old Popeye's than to this one that's about 1 mile away< /Review>

It has been a while I tried KFC or Popeyes because since I tried Korean fried chicken I found American brands are too greesy, but Popeyes chicken were fresh and delicious.<//review>

Worst popeyes location i have ever been too. Before the New manager they were out of everything. No sauces at all no honey not even napkins. Went there yesterday and bought a decent amount of food I was given 2 ranchs i asked for 2 more sauces and they told me no. They would not even sell me 2 more sauces. Who the hell wants to eat dry chicken. Not me I'm about my sauces lol. I will never be going back here. I understand they want to cut back but if I'm willing to pay for 2 more sauces I should be able to purchase them. The wait time is ridiculous. Over 30 minutes in a drive thru line sometimes. Alot of times they dont have mild chicken tenders only hot. Customer service sucks there. I get attitudes from most the people at the drive thru including the manager. Also i thought popeyes comes out with a new 5 dollar box monthly. Not this place . Boneless wings 5 dollar box for over 5 months now.</text>

I asked them about the special that they advertised on TV and told me it was not available. Then to come to find out it was available. So instead of spending $8 for two meals I walked away spending $21 for two meals.</review>

That's far better than having something to complain about, in my book.</Text>< pics>

Terrible. My fish & shrimp only had shrimp. My 8 pc chx strips had 12 pc.
Terrible... Terrible.. Warning they do not check to see if orders are correct. Disheartening when you get home and what you ordeted is not there. Terrible.</Text>

45 min in the drive thru.  Previous reviews were most likely by family members and friends this place is a joke. Everyone in here is so lazy. They don't even care. It's almost like they think they're doing you a favor.<//text>

Popeyes has the Tuesday 2 pieces of leg & thigh for $2.00 that is a steal. And $5.00+ daily deals that fill you up.</Text>
