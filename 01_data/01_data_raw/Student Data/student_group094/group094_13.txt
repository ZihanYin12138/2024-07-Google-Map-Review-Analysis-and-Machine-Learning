<text>Service was very amiable and the help I received was really heart warming and helpful during these hard times. Rodrigo & John helped to make sure I didn’t lose my items to auction and went every step beyond to inform me and make sure I never fell behind.

<text>Fantastic Service. John was very professional and friendly. Took time to show me a few different options/sizes which helped me to decide on what unit best fit my needs. Both John and Edward are awesome.
Anytime you bump into them they will great you with a friendly smile and a 'Hi how are you doing'? Or 'How have you been'?
It never fails. Fantastic customer service and I Highly recommend renting at this location if convenient for you.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKpfMKY2xUChR3hQUwKil3pwvNZkQNncWXsjVx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuKHgw0FBbU8kMT3YaPgA7xvjSD1MxvqVDUwSA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJQG2-zf8a98RWG0OG3nRwL8zzEhXEdpK2Kwjo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4cjAm8zSfKVTYd1VVLsUvyUEiCf7vyCKauIVd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqo1cBJPEj0KRYP4uzoxJ6uYpfP70k96sbF22o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZbNEw3bhbuKE8GfH4e_b0S7zJEjV1NkadooDO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPftak8oacMVRxKyiuBOGM8D6jGN2nTwOFj1oi4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsr-MIxLhUwNuG1YtKTSdSV6P-aBAm1CrWQhzL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNh1GDpPBboWTuBUq75oGdKRMJZF-WsaV8H1iMz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNV54sDytuk7xpbRqDnwVNppRur1O_Oy-xOdI08=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNm2-F7yI_jRFsqZfHcJANvYvt5lhx0UPTQING7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9ykLNJeqq51gTvA7ZXVIZuL5rbvRJRYBO9ivp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2nfb0_WI4lPkFuSdcyULrNxhvuI-Ev-SPV_UV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNV5utQ9gZyRdhxZEQuJEd-fn_y9isEr_tPFC4-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-9IQOc3U5qch0iBPH2_rXiK8DQAneTKl0Nyd-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN07gErLXWS4cU2zF4KrlbkCO_0LnVXdnoU3gc3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_ZI1FEbsGtdaZ2ruDSxMK3guS92i5mUDy8Oov=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>Really great experience! I've been at several storage locations in LA, and this is by far the cleanest & freshest. I am not personally renting, but I helped my friend move onto the 2nd floor & we REALLY loved the loading lift & flatbeds - they saved time and probably our backs haha. John & Sarah were super friendly & helpful. They also have a clean restroom which I used to wash my hands :) We were there on a Saturday, and even with other movers, we never had to wait for an elevator or flatbed. We also noticed that the loading area remained shaded, and it was a noticable 15° degree difference from being in the sun! Would definitely recommend!</Text>< Time>

SEAMLESS! Between the pricing, transparency, and assistance from Imani- booking was a breeze. Imani was so personable which made me feel comfortable to pull the trigger on my units. She was more than happy to help me through all my questions. I never felt like a bother, and you could just tell she really cared about you as the customer. It's rare to find, but Extra Space runs so efficiently.<//text>

Sarah is amazing. Had to download a new app to access my storage unit and she walked my technologically incompetent self through all of it over the phone. Extremely helpful and informative, which is how everyone has been at this facility. Extra Space Storage Glendale was recommended to me by a friend when I first rented there and I will always recommend it to anyone in need of a safe place for their belongings. Thank you, Sarah!!< /review>

No nonsense secure facility but could be a little more friendly and accommodating. For example there is no public restrooms for paying clients and they hassled us about the amount of time (2 days)our storage pod was taking up 1 spot in the parking lot while we moved in. Not the best first impression...</text>

<review>First time checking into my unit at this location. They are a testing site for a keyless entry system. Had some frustrating trouble at first, but the manager was helpful and the company Noki (sp?) that I believe handles the keyless entry ended up being helpful as well.

<user_name>E S</user_name><review>Had an overall great experience. From the day I moved into the storage unit, and until the I completely moved out. The place is only a couple years old, but is kept very clean and in working order. Appreciate the help from all the staff on duty when I had questions. Sarah was the one that helped me from the beginning. Very friendly, helpful with questions and concerns, and she made the whole process comfortable. She was not just trying to make a sale. Thanks again! I will definitely consider this location again if I ever need to rent out another storage unit.< /review>< gmapID>

Fast and easy setup. Transparent and good deal overall. Not open on Sundays for weekend warriors to get things done. Limited open hours during the week. If you work 9-5 they close at 6 during the week and open 9:30.. with LA traffic it is just not ideal. With such a limited open window parking can be full at times (see picture)... I was blocked in by a customer and had to crawl through my passenger door. Large trash can is usually full and have to get a manger to unlock it and sometimes they are not up in the front desk area.. taking more time form your day to track them down or wait.

Some basic customer experience flaws are prevalent. They ask for your review before you’ve experience it, hence the amount of 5 star reviews and had to update mine after seeing it’s not a 5 star experience<//Text>

The security is top notch and the location is convenient.  Clearly ran by a manager that cares, this place is a premier choice for storage at a value price.  10/10</review>< Date>

So I’m pretty sure I love this extra Space Storage location, and it has nothing to do with my unit. Sarah is absolutely amazing. So nice and knowledgeable! Took the time to show me everything I needed to know about the unit, location, paperwork, everything. She also bested me at naming bikes... not an easy thing to do if I should say so myself. To top it off there was a new guy being trained. Jesus! You’re going to rock it man! Thanks for all your help too. as fo the location itself... very clean and orderly. Easy access. I get the feeling my stuff will be safe. Witch is the most important thing. 10 out of 10. Thanks again Sarah!< /Review>

This place was super nice, clean and the service was top notch! Beth one of the employees was super cool and talkative . Could have a full on conversation with her literally about nothing . Sarah another employee was super beautiful too and super nice! Smile from side to side , plus at the end of the day I had a lot of trash to throw and she was nice enough to let me throw my trash in her dumpster . I would go back to that storage even if I live 50 miles further< /Text>

<review>Worst storage place ever!  Sales people are sharks!  The property is poorly designed so that one person cannot efficiently load or unload in or out of your unit. You need to use the lift or LONG ramp to get to the elevator that takes you to your floor. If someone is parked at the lift, you’re screwed. Yes, the place is clean, but so is Public Storage ... and PS is easily accessible. Trust me!  There is NO COST savings here!<//review>< time>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Absolutely love this place! John and Ed are the best! Positive, kind, upbeat and friendly, they make everything such a pleasure even when moving can be so stressful! The facility is immaculately clean and very secure. There are two loading docks which is fantastic because they are right at the elevators, so that makes moving your belongings to your unit go very smooth, and there are plenty of carts! The 80's music will keep you singing and dancing the whole time which is a plus! Overall you will find it extremely worth every penny to store your things at Extra Space! Thank you John and Ed for your great customer service. We really appreciate you both.

<text>I was truly impressed with the service I received at Extra Space Storage. Edward was the one who assisted me. He was very friendly and pleasant while also being extremely professional.
He had a way of making you feel very comfortable and minimized any stress through the experience.
Additionally, the facility has a great set up, it's very clean and updated.
Excellent experience!<//text></record></dataset><record>

John and Edward are awesome! John had helped me set up my unit when I first rented from Extra Space Storage & was very thorough. Edward had helped me in a jam I was in with needing a bigger unit in such short notice. If anyone needs a storage unit, this is the place to rent at. Amazing customer service & pricing is great! I highly recommend!

UPDATE (Jan 2020): I wanted to reinforce how awesome this storage place is! John came to my rescue again and helped me set up my unit.  Setting back up here was just as easy as it was the first time and still received the amazing service I got the first time around.  If anyone is looking for a storage unit, you won't find a better one than this!</Text>

<Text>I'm very impressed with this storage facility. It's conveniently located, easy to use, organized, and very clean. The staff is very helpful, nice and caring. The store manager, Edward Rivas has been so wonderful to work with and has been very helpful and understanding. The assistant manager John Adams is also great.

I've already recommended this place to so many people.

If anyone needs storage space, I highly recommend this place!< /Text><response>None<//response>< rating>

Jason from the call center was awesome. He went over my sizing needs and then outlined the pricing and availability of different units in several nearby locations. He also found a unit with a promotional offer for the first month's rent free.

Edward followed up with me right away from the  Glendale location on San Fernando. Within a couple of hours, I went from a phone call to signing for my brand new unit. John greeted me and handled all the paperwork. He was genuinely courteous and provided professional, expedient service. He took me for a tour of the unit and went over the gate key and locking instructions. The facility is all new with climate controlled atmosphere.

Although, I was initially told I'd only be paying $24 for the first month's charge (promo), the minimum insurance and lock fee brought the total to $55. Still, it's a great deal with great people. I'm just being as honest as possible in my review. I might only need the unit for a short few months or less this time, but I will definitely use this company again in the future - and hopefully be near enough to use the same location.

Thank you all for making my sudden moving crisis into a stress-free and pleasant experience.<//text>

<Name>Patrick David<//Name><Review>Amazing great new modern and sleek facility! Edward went above and beyond to help me out. Although what I had couldn't fit in the unit, he took the time to call me and help me find another location that was large enough. He even called them to let them know I was coming, and to hold the space. I wish I was able to store here. It looks to be the safest around.< /Review><Resp>None</Resp>< user_id>

<Review>This is business done right. Special thanks to John and Cathy at this location!

Review when I first rented my space:
I just had a very positive experience here. Cathy assisted me and was friendly and helpful. Newer facility. Good price for the amount of storage space I got. Recommended!

Update, 7 months later:
I'm still confident about my 5-star rating. I just moved out of my storage unit today (woohoo!) and checkout was easy and painless. I received excellent customer service from start to finish at this location, particularly by John — he's a very nice and helpful man. I would be more than glad to rent with Extra Storage again if I required their services.

A deeper reflection on my experience here: people rent storage spaces for various reasons. In my case, I was in a time of transition, moving from one state to another — this can be a sensitive time for people, so to have a company that cares as much as Extra Space seems to, is really a great service to humanity. Their customer service (and even their emails) made my time of transition a little more easy to manage. I love these guys and can't recommend them enough.</Review></record>

I have been using this location for 3 months, and storage units around the US for close to 10 years for my film gear. Big perks of this facility:
-no sketchy clientele or homeless people living in sheds.
- we’ll lit parking lot and gate
-incredibly secure!!! But not a hindrance. code access.
- super clean new
- the John and Ed show were incredible. (Staff)
- bathroom
- a great deal

Heck yes!< /review>

The staff is absolutely the friendliest I have ever met. The facilities themselves are absolutely top-notch and the parking is very substantial. I would highly recommend this facility anyone looking for storage space to rent. Also being a relatively new rental facility they are giving great deals for storage spaces for rent. If you're in the market for storage facilities to rent space in I would highly recommend that you check this out you will not be disappointed!😊<//Text>

<review>The staff at this Extra Space storage are a class act. Edward and John are courteous, never grumpy, helpful and very patient.  I recall one occasion on the night of my trip to the east coast. I had stopped by the storage to get a few things but forgot my wallet in my unit. I remembered when I got back home but couldn't make it in time before the facility closed, thanks to LA traffic. I called & explained my situation to them that I'll be arriving just a few minutes after they closed. These gentlemen were kind enough to wait for me until I arrived to get my wallet. This kind of courtesy is very rare in Los Angeles. Edward and  John are great ambassadors of Extra Space storage and thanks to their demeanor, I would always strongly recommend this facility to everyone. They also have reasonable prices compared to other storage facilities.</review>< pics>

OMG Becky look at this storage, it is soooo clean. It looks like one of those rap stars houses or something.

Serious note: I am super please with the customer service I have received from the staff here. Edward was very helpful and informational. He explained everything in full detail. I also had the great pleasure of completing my reservation with the manager Sarah and she had the best customer service and was very polite with great knowledge.

Super pleased....

P.S. my storage is better than yours!!<//text>

< Review>
Ok so i’m a new customer at this facility as of yesterday, so this review is simply based off the first week. FIRST of all, this place is immaculate in the actual storage facility. I’ve never seen a storage facility this clean and well-kept. Secondly, the customer service is amazing. My first experience when I was just viewing the facility was with Beth (i believe that’s her name)...and she was so nice it’s ridiculous. She was new, and in training after only 6 days on the job, but she still did everything she could to help me out and make me feel welcome. Then when I came back to actually lease a space a couple days later, John helped me, and he made me literally feel like I was buying a new home and he wanted me to know everything about it. Amazing. If customer service was like this everywhere...I would go bankrupt from giving everyone my money. I honestly like the people working here so much, that I forget that they are simply helping me lease a storage space. I’ve had nothing but great experiences with Extra Space thus far. I’m switching facilities because the one I’m currently in doesn’t have any larger rooms available at the moment for the price I need (even though the manager there, Steven, is JUST as awesome as these people). SO bottom line...first impressions matter, and I’m telling everyone about this place as if i just found a great new restaurant. Crazy.< /Review>

—96% Increase On Rent After 5 Months!!!—

I rarely write negative reviews, but I am shocked by the corporate greed and predatory pricing practices of Extra Space Storage.

After an unexpected death in the family, we ended up needing to rent 2 units from Extra Space on short notice.  A few months later, Extra Space increased the monthly cost of both units, nearly DOUBLING the cost of one unit.  The process of figuring out what happened has revealed Extra Space's profit-at-all-costs business model, and a stunning lack of transparency.

Understandably surprised and shocked at a 96% increase, I spoke to the call center, district manager, and building manager to see if this was a mistake.  Each understood our frustration, but informed me that the "market rate" for that unit was now almost double.  The district manager explained that the rate changes all the time based on computer algorithms.

To verify this, we did quite a bit of research online and found that we could still get the exact size unit in the SAME FACILITY for $130—one dollar less than we initially rented it for.  Moreover similar units were available in the area from competitors in the same price range, so it seems Extra Space's algorithm and market rate excuse did not hold water.

When we called asked them to match THEIR OWN PRICE, they said that we were not eligible couldn’t get that deal because we were not “first time renters.”  Reviewing our original paperwork when we originally signed up, it is clear that we were never given any sort of promotion, and nowhere in the fine print did it mention that we were being offered a rate for being for first time renters.  In fact, our rate was simply described as the “web rate” or “flash sale" and listed no qualifications or exclusions.  Extra Space had created this loophole to benefit themselves after the fact.

The Extra Space corporate call center had a district team lead named Paul reach out to us regarding this.  Unfortunately, instead of de-escalating the situation, he could not properly explain the inconsistencies in my rent increase.   Furthermore, he could not provide me with any statement on their website that referenced the restrictions they were mentioning verbally.  Paul informed me that he would “allow" me to have that web rate, but—astoundingly—later retracted the rate even though I had a CONFIRMATION EMAIL that guaranteed the rate in writing.

This extraordinary runaround from Extra Space and their employees in a period of incredible grief for our family has been nothing short of astounding, compassionless, and time-wasting.

I spoke with a rep at A-1 Storage and they only raise the rent for tenants 10% a year.  If nothing else, we’d like other renters to be warned about Extra Space Storage and their secretive predatory rent increase practices.</text>

—96% Increase On Rent After 5 Months!!!—

I rarely write negative reviews, but I am shocked by the corporate greed and predatory pricing practices of Extra Space Storage.

After an unexpected death in the family, we ended up needing to rent 2 units from Extra Space on short notice.  A few months later, Extra Space increased the monthly cost of both units, nearly DOUBLING the cost of one unit.  The process of figuring out what happened has revealed Extra Space's profit-at-all-costs business model, and a stunning lack of transparency.

Understandably surprised and shocked at a 96% increase, I spoke to the call center, district manager, and building manager to see if this was a mistake.  Each understood our frustration, but informed me that the "market rate" for that unit was now almost double.  The district manager explained that the rate changes all the time based on computer algorithms.

To verify this, we did quite a bit of research online and found that we could still get the exact size unit in the SAME FACILITY for $130—one dollar less than we initially rented it for.  Moreover similar units were available in the area from competitors in the same price range, so it seems Extra Space's algorithm and market rate excuse did not hold water.

When we called asked them to match THEIR OWN PRICE, they said that we were not eligible couldn’t get that deal because we were not “first time renters.”  Reviewing our original paperwork when we originally signed up, it is clear that we were never given any sort of promotion, and nowhere in the fine print did it mention that we were being offered a rate for being for first time renters.  In fact, our rate was simply described as the “web rate” or “flash sale" and listed no qualifications or exclusions.  Extra Space had created this loophole to benefit themselves after the fact.

The Extra Space corporate call center had a district team lead named Paul reach out to us regarding this.  Unfortunately, instead of de-escalating the situation, he could not properly explain the inconsistencies in my rent increase.   Furthermore, he could not provide me with any statement on their website that referenced the restrictions they were mentioning verbally.  Paul informed me that he would “allow" me to have that web rate, but—astoundingly—later retracted the rate even though I had a CONFIRMATION EMAIL that guaranteed the rate in writing.

I have had my share of storage units over the years and this place definitely tops the charts. You'll be hard pressed to find a facility with longer gate access hours and friendlier, more helpful management and staff....including other ESS facilities!

<review>Extra Space Storage is awesome!! Don't waste your time with Public Storage which is way over-priced and they hike up their prices. The Extra Space guys are super friendly, helpful and accommodating. The spaces are indoors, fully temperature controlled with great lighting. An extra bonus is the piped in 70s and 80s music. So while you are going through your things, you can rock out to Bon Jovi. I highly recommend them!!<//review>< gmap_id>

<Review>Edward and John have been helpful and totally responsive to my questions and needs.  It was so easy to sign up and make the whole thing work.  We are moving across the country to L.A. - stressful.  So great, such a relief, to have this aspect of the move go so smoothly.  Thank you.</Review>< user>

John and his team at Extraspace make it a very easy and efficient process to secure storage at their facility. The place is uber clean and climate controlled for your belongings.  I submit that the price competition would be hard to beat for what they offer.

Thanks John<//review>

I am not much of a reviewer by any means however at this point I felt the need to say something. I have been doing business with extra space for over a year now and I just have to mention what exceptional service I've had during this time. Edward especially had been nothing short of extrodinary. He has always went above and beyond to accomdate and assist.

The facility is extremely clean and well secured. Location for me has always been convienent. Access throughout the building is with ease. I am extremely impressed with it all.

Well done Extra Space and Edward!!!<//Text>

I appreciated their smile and candidness with me while there. Edward spoke consistently with a smile and an openess to my concerns and questions.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

WOW! I was recently working at this location as a consultant when my car died onsite. Without any hesitation, the staff helped me jump my car and got me on my way. THIS is the kind of customer service you wish and hope for everywhere. They went above and beyond and I couldn't be more thankful.< /text>

Worst experience ever I called prior to going in and a lady answered telling me that there was no wait I went in with my friend at 3 p.m. the lady kept getting distracted and taking care of customers that were in coming instead of doing my nails. I waited two hours to walk out with just powder on my nails and she still had the gual to charge me $22 dollars for horribly shaped nails. Without polish. Don't come here save yourself the headache!!!!!!
P.s place looks run down.<//Text>

<Review>Friendly staff, understood exactly what I wanted. The $35 pedicure was nothing short of amazing. They actually time the massage a full 10 minutes, & she even gave me a mini face massage. My gel fill needed no corrections, and was is the perfect shape. Also, very clean and comfortable. I will be coming back.</Review>< Pics>

<review>I went into the nail shop to have two pedicures and three manicure rendered.  The lady said I had to have an appointment.  The other staff looked at her funny as if they had never heard her say this.  I called back to the establishment and asked if I had to make an appointment and they stated I did not.  It’s a shame the world is still like this.<//review>< Rating>

I stopped by twenty minutes before they usually open. I was desperate to get gel polish on a nail that was splitting vertically down the nail bed, as it was painful and I didn't want to keep snagging it on things all day at work. Ms. Nguyen had just arrived and was unlocking the door and she offered to help me right away. She even put an amazing mesh substance over the split area to reinforce it. She then meticulously painted them with gel polish. My nails ended up perfect, feel great, and the price was excellent. Thank you!<//Review>

They do a spectacular job on your nails. They take their time to satisfy the customers with great effort. I like how they greet you while offering you if you need any refreshments.  I would recommend this place to my family and friends.<//text>

Today was my first time and I enjoyed my mani/pedi services along with a facial and head massage. Nathalie did an excellent job. She was meticulous, very kind, and gentle. Although the shop could use some updating, it was very clean, organized, and the staff was great. I'll definitely return. THANKS LADIES!<//Text>

<text>New spot for me. I went in for a pedi but left with a foot/leg scrub, forehead massage, hot towel treatment and water/ hot tea offered. It is a nice spot and everyone was super friendly and clean instruments used. I was very pleased with the pedi and all the extra services that were included in the price. I will be a returning customer.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Not sure how this place got such high reviews and shining accolades... all I wanted was a full set of coffin nails they charged me 40 bucks which I thought was overpriced for medium  length... there was no posting of prices for anything, like they were just making things up as they go ...and trying to describe exactly what I wanted and the color in matte was very frustrating... I also got a pedicure which I agreed to and they started before I realized how crappy the services was. I just wanted a flower on my big toe, they told me they didn't do designs but the lady next to me walked away with a design on her big toe ...a flower!!!  When I bought it to the attention of the tech doing my nails she said "oh we don't do big big design, just simple..."  There's a language barrier because the majority of the workers in there aren't fluent in English and the one younger nail tech that was had an attitude problem  and I'm sure began to speak about me badly in their language because every other word was "problem"or "difficult"  as she's glancing in my direction ... in the end, I didn't even walk away with a job I was satisfied with...my toenails look like I painted them at home and my nails look like I got them done two weeks ago because she started the polish so far away from my cuticle it looks like I need a fill already... and every time I tried to bring these things to her attention, all I got was "don't worry, don't worry..." The worst 60 bucks ever spent!!! I will never go back...not to mention the place is a hole in the wall outdated, dusty equipment...literally layers of dust on the equipment and not from the acrylics or gel...  and the bathroom is just nasty...hoping I did not walk away with a MRSA infection or fungus...lesson learned...< /Text>

This place is the worst nail shop I've ever been to. Initially I called in to ask if they're busy & I was told I can come in. Got there quickly and they had me waiting 25 minutes while I watched the owner argue with a customer. Long story short the argument got really nasty, the customer was telling the owner to just let it go, but the owner refused and got really loud with the customer to the point where the customer's husband had to step in & intervene. They were arguing over nail polish. It was so unprofessional and stressful to not only me but other people there also. Other customers walked out! There were kids there while all this went down. This place is awful. Not only that but right afterwards the owner tried to tell me they charge $33 just for a fill! Because they use "the good stuff" after I just heard a woman complaining that their nail polish always chips off after a day. Crazy. 33 dollars for a fill?? It didn't even look like they carry 33 nail polish colors. You have to be desperate to waste your money here</text>

If I didn't live in Northern California 12 hours away, I would be a regular here. This is hands down the best salon iv ever been to in my life and I am a beaitician, I know good work. The staff is SO friendly, they will actually talk to you dispute the language barrier. They actually massage your legs and noy just lightly rub them. SUPER CLEAN. Opened all their utensils right in front of me so I knew the items were unused. I was very impressed and would highly recommend this salon to Anyone.<//text>

<user_name>Changhoon Oh</user_name>< Text>
I wanted to purchase protect film for my new iPhone 8. A clerk said that he will attach to my phone if I buy it. Therefore I just asked him "please take care of it while I am watching other stuff" - It was my stupid mistake. He did it for me. The problem was he chose very expensive $39.95 premium glass - without asking me a single word. In addition, he also add GoWireless membership, which cost $79.99, again without asking me. Because GoWireless membership includes premium protection film, which makes $39.95 film free of charge, but that does not change the fact that I became an idiot who spent more than $80 for just protect film. I don't know how good GoWireless membership is, but I really didn't want to spend that much money on my phone.

One more: this may not be a problem of the store, but the store has expensive accessories only . Cases for almost all phones starts from $39.99. - I haven't checked but I assume this would be the same for protection film; at least I want to believe that's why the clerk gave me almost $40 protection glass without a single question. It may be okay to purchase a phone / enroll Verizon at this store, but it might be much better not to buy accessories here, unless you are willing to spend a lot of money on your phone.< /Text>

It is probably a poorly managed franchise only.  The main thing is no customer service. They showed the attitude that if you dont like our service and products, please walk away.   Before I came, I looked up the online reviews, that is what brings me in.  Eventually, it disappointed me. So I went to T-mobile and Att that are better in customer service.< /Text>< Rate>

This location has always had pretty chatty employees but as it's closest to me so its convenient . I needed to make a purchase and I already know what I want. So I go in, there are 2 woman sitting at the counter one of which being helped by the gentleman behind the counter. I'm not acknowledged in the slightest but anyhow I grab what I need and patiently wait. The banter is friendly however it starts to veer really off topic of fixing of the phone. The other woman is an LG rep? That's what was said but either way the talk turns to karaoke and what plays the woman has seen all the while I'm standing patiently waiting 2 feet away from the counter. Another gentlemen walks in and without any acknowledgment to him either the store rep continues to talk to the woman he was helping. This goes on for a total of 15mins mind you I need to make one 40 dollar purchase. The woman finally says why don't i sit over here so you can help the gentleman in reference to me and the other customer. Now mind you I know the verizon rep saw me waiting but instead asked who he could help and turned to the gentleman who walked in AFTER ME to help him. Typically customer service would cater to first come first serve basis so I don't know why he thought that was ok. At this point I put the merchandise back on the shelf and left. This isn't first problem I've had with this location. I'm all about customer service but when the line piles up a little damage control goes along way. Last time I'll ever come to this location and I'll glad pay 60 for the same product somewhere else where I know the customer service tends to be a priority.< /text>

<Review>I found this to be very clean and the office personnel very helpful and friendly. The original price when we first rented was very low and over the course of a year rose to $70 per month for something like 10x10? Anyway overall easy to get to and clean.< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1614601024230, 'text': "Thanks, Barbara Silva !

I needed a large storage unit ASAP . When I walked in to Storage Pro,
The office was very clean.
The staff Manny and Alisha was working. And they were so helpful to all my needs and concerns on storing my belongings.
When Alisha took me out to see the storage unit I was going to rent, I could not believe how clean every thing was. The halls, the outside, the unit.
They run a very respectable business .
I give them five stars. I would give more if there was that option. I want to thank both of you for being so helpful and so caring.  Toni</Review>

Cassandra is such an amazing manager she is always there to help just today alone I saw her go from the 3rd floor to help someone with their door run downstairs put the customers code in for them come back up made sure they were good went back down stairs. By the time I was done and went back to my car I saw her cleaning the bathrooms and she still stopped to see if I was okay. She was doing the work of 3 all by herself. She genuinely seems like she cares. Thank you cassandra keep up the good work<//review>

<Review>I've been pretty happy with this place. Clean, well maintained. A minor problem is the hours, they close at 7:00pm, which can make access hard for people with a day job and commute.< /Review>< pictures>

Very poor experience across a variety of visits and on the website. However, it may be that all businesses in this industry have poor experiences for their customers.</Review>

<rate>3< /rate><text>The electricity was out in the section for the whole weekend that I moved into the storage unit. Now they sent out an email showing all of the tenants email addresses. 😡

UPDATE: I have had no problems since the first month. The location is always clean and no problems with the electricity. The only things I wish they would improve on; adding more carts and a slightly different design to their invoicing. They send the invoice two weeks before the due date, but the invoice is sent as an ambiguous form letter with an attached invoice with the actual billing details. I only go to the storage unit once a month, and in those visits I haven't had any further problems.< /text>< Pics>

Manager is a very friendly and helpful. They have awesome deals going on right now 50% off for the first 3 months or $1 first month. You have to buy your own lock if you dont have the correct lock used to fit the storage unit, theres a one time service fee as well. The place is very secured.< /review>

So I was there last week I believe it was Tuesday or Wednesday April 14th there was this white lady kept repeating over and over she was the site manager her name starts with an A or something, she was beyond rude dismissive and was just so unpleasant. I went in to ask about storage information and she just talked so fast and my brother is an addict I could tell she was on something. Storage Pro if this is your site manager you need to start drug testing. She said the site is only open from 7am to 7pm yet when I drove by there was a truck in the back area with the door wide open and I got off of work around 9pm. I will be calling corporate and making a full complaint cause this isn't how a company should be ran.<//Review>

< Review>
This place confuses me. It's like they ran out of money to do it right. First off, you have to get out of the car to push the code to get in. Then there are NO key pads on the upper floors. So when you lockers auto locks you have to go all the way down and reenter your  code. Also they have a new guy that kept leaving my leaver to the left. He made me have to go up and down to enter that code so many times because of of his mistake. Make sure your lever/lock is all the in to the right before going down to enter the code. And train your people better please cause damn!!<//Review>

< Review>
My husband got a jacket from our son for Christmas and the drawstring metal tip came off. He was quite disappointed with the quality of this new jacket. We finally had a chance go to south coast plaza and this lady was kind enough to tell us the procedure on fixing the item. However she said it was going to take 6-8 months for them to fix it. So my husband asked if he could exchange for something else since it was a damaged item and it was within 30 days period. They said the item was worn and had no tags, so exchanging wasn’t possible. I asked her if it was possible for the production team to send us the extra missing metal piece so that we didn’t have to wait that long. She went to ask the manager, it took awhile for them to figure out for us for something so small. Then this girl with a pair of white eyeglasses came over and was explaining the procedure all over again to us and my husband was upset and annoyed at this point. AS A CLIENT WHO WAS UPSET, you as a salesperson, should’ve listened and be more understanding to the client. This girl interrupted him SO RUDELY saying, “Can you let me finish? Can you let me talk?” Then calls over the manager and says “Can you come over here, cause this guy is not letting me talk”. RIGHT IN FRONT OF US.

I worked in the fashion industry for a very long time as a salesperson and as a manager. I had experiences with angry clients before but I have NEVER DEALT with clients like the way that she did! I would listen to them and try to handle the situation, NOT BEING RUDE TO THEM. Maybe she had a bad day, I gave her the benefit of the doubt, but I was absolutely baffled how she handled the situation.

The store manager was very understanding and she knew how to situate the matter. NOW THAT shows LEADERSHIP and how to run the store! I hope this store manager takes action by giving this girl a write up or some sort of action so that she will never act like this to other clients ever again! We hope to shop there again and never see this girl! If her attitude stays like that, then she is working in the wrong industry!</Review>

Came into the Burberry store since they had a really great sale online and the scarves I wanted were only sold in store. When we got here, however, we were disappointed that all of their sale items were gone. They said it was “due to their relocation” so all of the  sale items were sold first. I guess that’s understandable.

With their scarves, it’s so important to look at them in store. There’s only so much you can tell from online, such as the fit, the feel of the fabric, and how it looks on you. Because they didn’t have custom embroidery available in the store, I only came in just to browse which one would be better to purchase but I did end up buying the classic cashmere scarf online so I could get the tan embroidery for free.

If you have a shop runner account, you get free 2-day shipping. Since the delivery time was equivalent for home or in-store delivery, I opted for in-store so I could also pick up the shopping bag (they’ll only do gift wrapping if you ship to your home.) The personalization definitely takes more time to prepare but I kid you not, once the work was completed and the item had been marked as shipped, I received it 24 hours later. Talk about speed!

Picking it up at the store was a breeze. Just had to show them my email confirmation with my order number and despite the email requiring you to show your photo ID and the card you used to purchase it, I did not need to show it to them.

The only reason why I docked them a star was because I had ordered my mom’s scarf the day before I decided to order one for myself and for some reason I received mine two days before hers. I emailed customer service and they said that some orders take longer than others but it was literally the same scarf with the same colored embroidery and the letters “AZC” seem harder to have embroidered than “CRZ” so I’m not sure what happened there.

I also was a bit disappointed in the package display. Yes, they’ll wrap your product in gift wrapping if you opt for it, which in this case is wrapping the item with tissue paper and sealing with the Burberry signature sticker inside a sturdy cardboard box, which is then placed inside their bag. I didn’t like that the bags looked as if they had been through some work, as in there were some scuffs and dents that seemed like they traveled some ways to get to me.

I also thought it was odd how my own scarf did not have ribbon tied around the box and the bag but my mom’s did. It almost gives me the impression that it just depends on who’s working at that time that will determine to what level of presentation their team wants to put forward. To me, that’s not a good look but I guess I’m just nitpicking.

Overall, I did enjoy my shopping experience here and plan to purchase more products in the future. I do hope that they take my suggestions quite seriously regarding the packaging and presentation. They’re still a designer store in my books, so I would hope that they’d like to continue providing the same level of excellence that their competitors consistently provide.<//text>

<date>1619667320825</date><Rate>1</Rate><review>BEYOND RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE.
5 months ago I saw a nice handbag in the window of this store but it was closed.

I went back to the store a couple of weeks later and they were closing in 5 minutes and therefore did not want to let me in to see the bag.  The woman at the door told me to 'come back another day'.

Busy with other things, I finally had time to return to the store a third time today and was there 30 minutes before closing (plenty of time).  A young man named Andy who was very nice let me into the store and went searching all over for the bag.  He finally found it (about 20 minutes in) and let me try it on.  I had it on my shoulder when he was 'called away' by the 'manager' to do something in the back (really?  the manager interrupts the customer and the sale because whatever happens in back right before the store closes is so much more important than serving the person standing there who he was already helping????)

At this point, it was close to closing time and I was the only customer in the store.  A young man with blonde hair (who was maybe a security person or maybe a sales associate?) approached me within 3 feet and told me to raise the mask I was wearing over the top of my nose.  I told him he was closer than 6 feet, that I had to breathe, that he had approached me not vice versa, that I was the ONLY person on the selling floor of the store (besides him), and that he was welcome to back up.

He refused to back up, standing closer to me than 6 feet, demanded I raise my mask over the top of my nose, and told me that Andy had "gone in back" because "the manager called him".  Really?  I explained that I was waiting for Andy to return so that I could buy the bag.  He told me that If I did not raise the mask over the top of my nose then I had to leave the store.

I told him that he had just cost the store not only the sale of the $3,000 purse but also my future business.  He obviously was quite proud of himself and enjoyed his little power trip, and grinned as he wished me a nice day and I left the store.

Note to Burberrry:  You will not stay in business as a luxury store behaving the way you did with me.<//review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<Text>Worse sales experience.  We stopped before covid here before and everything was fine. My son bought me a gift and from day i opened it had a defect in the product.  Part was missing.   I tried to go back few times but to change this and was unable to get in due to line.
Finally last week made it in.  The girl helping us wouldn't wan to let me finish my explanation. She interrupted me and said LET ME FINISH FIRST !
Was not expecting this behavior from luxury store.  Then her mgr came and said they can fix it but it takes 8 months.  Really? 8 months !!!  I wanted to change it but they were treating us like we are trying to do something illegal.  State of california law is if product is defect it must be replaced or returned without a question.  But these people were not having any customer service in their mind.  They ganged against us and refused us having a exchange.
I put a review here 2 days ago and some how they removed it.
I asked for their first and last name to address this to company and the girl said again said rudely YOU DON'T NEED OUR LAST NAME.
this was not south coast plaza Burberry store i remember.  ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I would not recommend any one shop here.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Okay I love this place and their clothes, so this review really has nothing to do with the items themselves.  My frustration comes from the company’s return/exchange policy.  I bought my boyfriend a pair of cufflinks which he turned out to already have.  Due to some scheduling issues, I wasn’t able to bring them back to the store til after the 30 day mark.  The cufflinks are still in the box, hasn’t even been opened, and they refused to give me even store credit. Total BS – I will never buy Burberry ever again.</review>

This damaged bag shouldn’t even be shipped to the customer at the first place!!! I called customer service many times, they can’t help me much since this bag is out of stock!!! I will have to exchange in the store for something else!!!!!!!!!! I am disabled and handicapped! I told them I can’t go to the store! But they said it’s the only way!! Obviously, they don’t care about customers!  It was not my fault to receive a damaged product!! And now I am being punished! I will never buy from US Burberry again! All they care is money and business! And delivered damaged products to customer with super expensive price! Very bad people and very unethical company!!!< /text>< Pics>

< Review>
My wife and I were there during our vacation over the Christmas holiday when she spotted a $5,000 leather Burberry coat that was on sale that she wanted. They didn't have her small size until a girl named Erica found one in the back. We carefully inspected it right there and then, and it was flawless, so I decided that I was going to get it as a Christmas present for my wife. I wanted it shipped back to my home state, and I had asked for a Burberry box since it was a gift. When we came back from our vacation on Christmas day, the Burberry coat had arrived. Not only did it NOT come with a gift box, but it also had this quarter-size pen mark on the collar, and someone had tried to clean it off, but left a bigger mark there instead. The coat was placed backwards inside a garment bag, so that we couldn't see the pen mark and damage when we first unzipped the bag. I had never seen my wife so disappointed and shocked before when we took the coat out. This was deliberately done. We both grew up in Southern California, went to UCLA and then UCSF for medical school. We shopped at South Coast Plaza all of our lives. This is South Coast Plaza, and there is a standard here, a high one, that keeps us and many others coming back again and again. Whether this Erica girl deliberately sent us a marked and damaged $5,000 leather Burberry coat or not I can't be sure. But what I am certain of, is that she was in charge of the handling of that coat, and to get it to us (it was NOT damaged when we were there inspecting it).  And that is how it arrived to us damaged. Whether it is her or someone in shipping or anyone else there who handled this coat after we purchased it, this should have never happened, and the damaged coat should never have been sent out or sold to a customer. You would think the Burberry employees at South Coast Plaza were trained better than this. We thought we were going to have one of the best Christmas in a long time, but instead it became one of the worst ever. We will never shop at Burberry at South Coast Plaza again. I would rather take my business to the Rodeo Drive or the San Diego locations, since their customer service are head and shoulders above, and I know that my expensive purchases will be handled correctly, as they always have been before, and that we will never be disappointed.  I will post a picture of the damage that they did to the coat after we had purchased it as soon as I figure out how to on Yelp!< /Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) Generally speaking, it's good, but there are individual sales. I made it clear that I first looked at and then continued to sell products to me. At first the attitude was not very good, but the attitude changed 180 degrees when it was said to buy a few. In fact, I think that individual sales can do better in terms of service attitude. Of course, this is just my personal opinion.

(Original)
总体来说是不错的，但是有个别销售在我很明确的说我先看看之后不断的向我推销产品。最开始态度并不是很好，但当说要买几件时态度发生了180度的转变。其实我觉得个别销售在服务态度上可以做的更好，当然这也只是我个人观点。< /text>< pics>

HORRIBLE SERVICE!! I called for a Simple Quote and the guy is correcting me on what is wrong with my phone!! I just needed a simple glass replaced and he’s trying to tell me that i have touchscreen problems, without even looking at my phone. Then I’m trying to just ask my question about the price and he’s trying to argue and yell at me about whats wrong with my phone! Like dude please just tell me the price! I don’t know why he wanted to argue, its Sunday! We should be peaceful!</review>

<Text>Cheapest iPhone Repair is by far one of the best in the business when it comes to customer servicing, repair/maintenance, and professionalism. I chatted with Sean and he is one of the nicest and most respectful gentlemen in the phone repair game and I recommend anyone in need of the Cheapest iPhone Repair to visit him!

Great service! Everyone here was professional and friendly. The location is close to my office so I popped in to repair my screen (still not sure how I broke it...I didn't even drop it!) Quick, easy, and super reasonably priced. Highly recommended.<//review>

I have a 2015 Macbook Air that suddenly died on me. I sent it in for diagnosis with Apple and they said it would be the logic board and would cost over $600, almost $700.

I said no because for that price I put it towards a new macbook pro instead. I found Cheapest iPhone Repair and sent a message online and they said to bring it in for a free diagnosis. After a couple of days Carlos told me it was the motherboard and their price to replace it was almost less than half of Apple. They replaced and ordered a new battery for me and I've been a happy camper ever since. I definitely will be coming here for all my electronic needs. Great communication and great work!<//Text>

<name>Cole E<//name><time>1589602748604< /time><rating>5< /rating><text>I would like to start off by saying that this place can be a little tricky to find, but it is definitely worth the effort. When you pull into the parking lot, go to the far building and find the door that leads inside, go the second floor and find room 215, if you feel like you're walking into a surgical consulate, you're in the right place. This shop feels more like a doctor's office than a regular phone repair shop, and for me it was a wonderful change of pace, I knew right away that my phone was going to get the highest quality of attention. The room is arranged out with a long workstation running the width of the space, filled with a large array of carefully organised tools, you really get the sense that the man behind the desk was a true professional, with immense attention to detail, dedicated to his craft. I had an issue with my charging port, I explained the problem I was having and mere moments after handing over one of my most coveted of possessions, the work had begun, expert hands meticulously labored over my device and by the time I had sat down and cracked open the book I had brought to entertain myself during the repair, the job was done, complete, FIN. Of course the repair was flawless, my phone happily charging besides me as I write this review. Ultimately , the prices were beyond fair and the experience fantastic, I will without a doubt be returning for all my future phone repair needs, only next time I will be bringing lunch for the staff, they have more than earned it.</text>< Pics>

Took a MacBook in for repair, for 2-3 weeks I received no update until I called, they informed me that it was unrepairable, they asked if they could keep it for parts... I agreed, few days later they call me to inform me they fixed it and offered to sell it back to me for $300, very shady business practice</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Friendly, helpful and trustworthy!! While on vacation my husbands iPhone stopped working. We could not get a charge and the carrier told us to go to an Apple Store. The store could not get us in for 3 days so I looked up an iPhone repair shop. We ended up at Cheapest iPhone iPad in Los Cerritos and they were great. They cleaned out the charging port and didn’t charge us. I had them look at my sons phone and they cleaned out his charging port as well. The screen on my sons phone was cracked and unlike other places they didn’t need hours or days to fix it. In less than 30 minutes my husbands phone was working, he had a new case both his and our sons phone had new tempered glass and our other son had a new battery.  Carlos was friendly and helpful and I wanted to give him our business. This was such a better experience than we’ve had at other repair places.</Text>< pics>

All the previous reviews were very accurate. The guy is very nice and reasonable. He fixed our iPhone so quickly. I was about to take it to the Apple store in Cerritos mall but did not want to wait 2 hours for someone to check it out. Before handing it off to us he walked through all the steps to show that everything worked.  Highly recommend< /text>

<review>What began as my cheapest solution to my cracked screen problem became an expensive one.

On September 14, 2017, I spoke with Justin and entrusted merchant, Cheapest IPhone Repair (CIR) to have my cracked glass screen on my phone (Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge) to be repaired. They gave me an estimated finished date of 5 days, but they took almost 2 weeks. Their excuse was that the phone was shipped back "incomplete" aka, they cracked my screen while shipping it.
On September 28, 2017, I was notified via phone that my cell phone was repaired and ready to be picked up. I went the same day to pick up my phone and noticed that it was not in the condition that it was given. To elaborate, CIR was able to repair the screen, but damaged my center home button of the phone when returned to me. After noticing this damage, I spoke with Carlos from CIR that the home button was not how it was given and the button was very loose (think "see-saw" action). Carlos expressed that he noticed the difference and he would speak to his boss. I left that day without my phone for CIR to resolve this issue.
On September 30, 2017, I was contacted by Carlos about the issue. Carlos stated that he spoke with his boss and said that CIR can try to fix the home button, which they couldn’t guarantee. CIR also stated that I would have to pay for the screen if it was broken during the repair process, which was quoted at $220. When asked if there were any other options, Carlos from CIR said, “This is all we can do.” I came into CIR to have my cracked glass repaired. However, they wanted me to potentially pay for a cracked screen for their own mistake. As a consumer, it makes sense that CIR would pay and/or fix what was their error. As a result of not wanting to potentially pay for a broken screen, I picked up my phone.

The use of the home button is essential for security (fingerprint sensor) and maneuvering phone applications.  Without the proper use and mechanism, it would render the phone useless and not functional. Even though the button is functioning presently, the loose, “see-saw” action of the button does not give me confidence that it will last, nor did I give the phone to CIR in this condition.

What began as my cheapest solution to my cracked screen problem was becoming an expensive one.

In brief, I came in with a problem and went out with another one.</review>< Rate>

The service was very professional and it is done in front of you so you definitely know everything is going to work correctly. It was expensive as I'm on a budget but the quality is there. I also received a complementary screen protector. Overall great place, hands down!<//Text>

I try to trick the guy if I can leave the phone but he prefers for me to stay so I can see what he is doing and to assure the integrity of work. First time visit but I do recognize the honesty of Justin and his recommendations. I do really recommend that before you go to apple for technical repairs, come first to CIR for honest advice to save you more money!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<text>Fast service, competitive price, and great quality products! Got my iphone 6+ repaired under 10 minutes right in front of my eyes. These guys don't take your phone to the back like some other cheap repair shops do. I just found out that the other place I got my screen replaced previously had left out couple volts while repairing. But, professionals at CIR won't do tricks with you! Highly recommended :)<//text>< userid>

Took them 2 weeks and 6 visits to get an ipad fixed.  Service was very unprofessional and technicians just blame the other technicians.  Dude, its just one company, it doesnt matter which technician's fault it is just be responsible.  And through out all this havent heard single "sorry" from any of'em.  Take it somewhere else instead.
Update: after 3 months of use, the screen came apart and iPad became unusable.  Total waste of money and time.<//Review>

Good price and quick service. Do not go to those guys at the Cerritos mall. They will charge you way more ( quoted me almost double ). Park behind the building and they are on the second floor. Recommended !< /text>

I took my Galaxy S8 to get the screen fixed. It was fixed and works ok, but after 4 months i am not sure if they sealed the phone right because there is dust particles building up inside my camera lense and for that reason it looks blury.< /text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I visited this store to get screens replaced on an iPad 2 and an iPad mini ($190 total price, 30-day guarantee).

The Apple repair service (Out-of-warranty) costs for these items are as follows:
iPad mini: $199
iPad 2: $249
Plus a $6.95 shipping fee. Fees are in USD and exclude local tax.

The store itself can be accessed via the elevator in the corridor between Gen KBBQ and Northern Cafe. There are doors on both sides of the building to get to the elevator.

When arriving to the store I was greeted immediately by Justin, who provided a quick assessment of my devices' conditions and a reasonable pricing for the overall repair.  After dropping the iPads off, I was expecting the job to be completed late in the afternoon or the next day, but I received a phone call only an hour later that the task was completed - Carlos and Justin were able to get the work done quickly after finishing up another repair order.

I returned to the store soon afterward and found both devices in solid condition.  Justin went through the final steps of heat-drying the adhesive and demonstrated the functionality of the new screens and other device functions.

Overall, I am very satisfied with the job and would recommend this store to anyone looking for mobile device repair services.  I also purchased a new, grandma-proof, dual-layer, protective case for an add-on price of $15!  We shall see how well it holds over the next few weeks of intense solitaire...< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

< review>
When my IPhone 7S Plus had difficulty charging despite plugging it in with several cords, I went to them and, for FREE, they took out the lint from the phone’s out. Now, my phone is charging like a champ! I just SAVED a TON OF MONEY by going to them rather than buy a new one for hundreds or thousands of dollars.</review>

It's all about customer service! Call to check my online order, rang 10 times.  The girl stated system was down the they won't refund.  Husband went to pick up, came home with someone else order. Tried to call again!!! No answer.  Went back to return and the order we had belonged to the lady who was returning someone else order 😖<//text>

<text>So we went to the one in Weaverville. The service was slow. They were out of a lot of things. And two out of the four of us got a small case of food poisoning. Skip this location!< /text>< username>

I tried calling in my order three times from their parking lot. Each time someone picked up the phone without speaking and hung up. There were no other customers at the time and three employees.< /review>

Good work by the young lady that made our sandwiches. That being said, there is a strange taste to the sandwiches, perhaps at all Subways, but this was the first noticeably odd taste. The bathroom was not wrecked, not well maintained, but have seen worse.<//text>

Well showed up at 7:30pm and the place was closing down they were mopping and the girl informed me the dinning room was closed and would have to take our sandwiches to go, weird they close at 9pm, I felt very rushed and felt like an inconvenience for wanting a sandwich last time I spend my $ here< /review>

<Text>As far as Subways go, this one is perty good. Very clean. Good friendly staff. It's a good stop when traveling to the coast. Better than the last food that's close by. And quicker and less expensive than the supermarket.

This place has terrible customer service. The workers are strait out of some teenage bad fiction. I would rather eat gruel in a gulag, than set foot back in this place.< /Text>

Tasty, affordable, and fun ramen place in Westwood. The servers were friendly and caring. Red ramen was decent as recommended. The chicken was crunchy. Fried rice was good. Veggie ramen was refreshing. The salad was fresh. The prices were reasonable. I got a free macaroon ice cream sandwich for following #thekopanramen on Instagram.</Review>

I did the build your own ramen bowl. Overall it was good. But next time I will get the extra spicy and I wont get the chicken breast. Putting a bland piece of chicken in a flavorful broth doesnt make sense to me.< /Text>

It was so so. I have had better. I had a hand crafted ramen that left me wanting more salt and the pork tasted like it was made yesterday. Disappointing honestly.< /Text>

Happened to be working off site today in the neighborhood.   I previously past Kopan Ramen and caught my attention.  Today on my lunch break I made sure to stop in.  I've also been dealing with a horrible cough too so broth was something I definitely needed.

I ordered the red dragon ramen as part of my combo lunch special.  I selected the seafood gyoza as my side.  The red dragon is rated spicy and indeed it is, but in a manageable way, if you like it spicy.  The broth was delicious and very coating for my throat.  The noodles were good.  My ramen came with fatty pork and it was very tender, easily edible with chop sticks.  Definitely recommend stopping if you're in the area.< /Text>

Sooooooo many ramen places around, it's hard to recommend this one. Main plus here is that they have a tasty fatty pork option, which they do a much better job of than their char shu.<//text>

4.25 Stars and looking forward to round two.

The house spicy ramen is very good. 4.25 stars. The Panko Shrimp was surprisingly good. A 4 star side. The Black Miso ramen was ranked “good” and there is a Veggie Ramen house special option so my Honey will be coming next time.

Bring the family, it’s a no brainer. They will have something for you and your most picky eaters. Just be prepared for bad breath. The soup is very tasteful, but I’m going to say garlic is a staple.

So if you have class after... stay in the back.< /text>

I ordered the black ramen special bowl with combination of fried rice. The flavors were a little bland, and didn't have that deep broth taste I was looking for. The servers  messed up on a order. However, they made it really fast right after I told them.</text>

Been to this ucla location twice and they never disappoint me. I dont know whats in their broth, but its so creamy and their noodles are uncomparable to all the ramen place ive been. Their spicy edamame oh my goodness its also so good. I loved their spicy oil and put some on my ramen,.
I hope they open near lake forest, mission viejo area because we dont have much really good ramen place here. Paging owners of kopan ramen!!</review>

small sit down restaurant. normally no wait. the menu is the same as other kopan ramens as its a chain. i normally do the build your own bowl so you can customize what size, meat, toppings you want. i think you can get a free soda if you check in on yelp.</review>

The ramen here has a strange film that forms over the top of the broth - maybe some cheap thickening agent? The red miso broth is creamy but not the way miso usually is. Both the black ramen and red miso ramen textures were wrong. The chasu pork was very low quality and my egg was completely hard boiled, not soft. Overall, some of the worst ramen I've had not out of a packet.

The service here is deplorable. The waiter dropped half a tray of water glasses on my friend and did not apologize or comp any of his meal. We had to flag him down several times for more water refills, and the orders were all screwed up when they came out. Definitely go to any other ramen place in Westwood.< /Review>

Jasmine milk tea with boba and cheese cream!! This boba drink is fire as usual

Passion green tea with cheese cream: not the best combo. These two are great on their own but not together.< /review>

Sometimes they did not check online orders, so I had to wait for another 20 mins at the store.
But the drink is great. Love the salted cheese!< /Text>

<review>The lemon black tea is a best seller and I had it with 50% sugar and extra ice. I liked the two pieces of real lemon wedges in it. The mango green tea comes with bits of mango fruit in it.< /review><user_id>110712896522991860375< /user_id>< Gmap_id>

Happy Lemon is a very corporate place for bubble tea and a salted cream cheese mix that they mix into drinks. That doesn't appeal to me, but it's some I've never seen before, which is always cool to come across.

What really did make my mouth water was their fruit teas. I had their strawberry fruit tea with boba. The boba are sweet. There were mashed up bits of strawberry at the bottom, yum!

The drink was good except I asked fo 50% ice which was a mistake. The ice was totally melted by the time the drink was ready, so it was too warm.I think it would have been delicious otherwise.

I really want to try the lemon slushies and the mango boba. They have a wide variety of toppings. There were a couple  whole sections of the menu I was unfamiliar with, but I'm not super experienced with this sort of thing.

The store was loud, hectic, and busy. There was a long line, but it moved quickly. The people behind the counter were working hard; it was just really popular.

I'll definitely go back and try other things.< /Text>

The team at Window Tint LA were professional and friendly - they handled my privacy frosting as well as the graphic vinyls on the outside of my windows.

Peter P came to assess and measure my job and was great to deal with. He listened to my needs and helped co-ordinate my needs onward. The team were quick in communication and were willing to go through multiple revisions on the mock-up until we reached the right design. Oscar R did my installation today and I was extremely happy with his work. He arrived to the job site early and as well as doing an excellent job he was very friendly and great to work with. I highly recommend Window Tint LA.< /Text>< Pictures>

<time>1524587365325<//time><text>Used window tint LA to have a privacy stripe added on our conference room glass. The process was very smooth, from first visit: taking measurements, providing samples and mock-up, to second visit: installation.

Our building has this annoying thing where they require insurance for anyone doing work. I sent it over last minute and the installer was so kind to wait for everything to be processed which was nearly an hour. So extra points for that.

The process was interesting to watch. It only took a couple of hours. We chose to go with a semi decorative strip for aesthetic reasons and it turned out great! I would definitely recommend.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMK1plVgkNjVH6XT1HKPYpmRmN014Cx86IRWUqi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

I’m an attorney and a real estate professional.  I’ve used this company, known as solar art and window tint La for several of my homes.  I’ve always been satisfied Until now.  I had a problem with information about the product I chose not being accurately provided by the sales person, Bob.  This resulted in a product being installed that looked horrible to all the real estate agents and designers who have been working with me on the home.

The response by the company was horrible.  Michelle B would never discuss the matter by phone, Jesus , who answers phones, always had no information and was consistently unhelpful as I tried to resolve the matter and move on with a new/different installation for The home,

Ultimately, with a Michelle B and apparently not Michelle M totally not comprehending my emails and unwilling to make a phone call, the matter ended very badly.

I would not recommend this company in its current state.  Weak customer service, poor guidance and knowledge about products, and an indifference as to whether customers are satisfied.  Beware of this company.</Review>

<Text>I wanted to tint my living room windows and also apply "frosted" window film for one of my rooms to limit visibility from outside. I called Window Tint LA and they set me up with a consultant for a free estimate. (note: they do not do estimates during weekends but they can come super early if you have to go to work; they can do installation on weekends though) The consultant, Peter, was very patient and helpful, and knew exactly what I wanted. Once I approved the project and paid the invoice, they called me to ask what date I wanted the installation. The installers, Hugo and Oscar, were super friendly, communicative, considerate, and diligent. Overall, I had an amazing experience with Window Tint LA. Everyone was professional and communicating with them was a breeze. I really appreciate this because I've had some bad experiences with certain contractors/installers. Many of them are not punctual and unresponsive. At times, I felt like I was the seller, not the customer, because I was the only one trying to follow-up. I'm very glad Window Tint LA set the standards high for me again. I would highly recommend Window Tint LA to anyone. Shout out to Peter, Hugo, and Oscar, who were awesome people and made this process as smooth as it can be!<//Text>< pictures>

get your tint or stereo, alarm, etc installed. Simon will give you the best possible deal and high quality work. If you don't buy from him, you both lose money!< /Review>

<Review>Windows Tint LA won our business by responding quickly to our emails. It was easy requesting the quote, submitting the artwork, and even paying for the job. Oscar  G. did an amazing job installing our decorative film. He was super friendly, professional, and clean while working. Overall, we're very satisfied with the outcome. They knew what we needed and how to do the job with no hassle!</Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2b8e720651abb:0x9beff37addede928</Gmap_id>< user_id>

<Review>My highest recommendation!  Peter came out to discuss my needs with patience, professionalism and knowledge. He was great to work with. Oscar did the installation on 5 very large picture windows, and was exceptionally skilled, careful, patient, and tidy.  The job came out flawless, and far exceeded my highest expectations. I have another set of large windows to tint in the near future, and I will of course insist on Oscar and Peter to come out again!!!!<//Review>< Pictures>

From Start with Betsy K showing us the products and helping us decide what is best for us, to finish with Hugo and Oscar's awesome installation.  Betsy was superior in knowledge and did not push anything on us or bug us on purchasing after she gave us our quote. Hugo and Oscar were clean and triple checked everything before they left.

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Window Tint LA did an excellent job tinting the windows in my house. The estimator, Peter, was knowledgeable about their products and pricing.  The installer, Roger, did an excellent and professional job of installation.  Roger worked neatly and cleaned up nicely after the job was finished.  Their pricing was fair and competitive.  I would definitely use them again and I would recommend them to anyone needing their window tinted.< /review>< pictures>

They came early to our sales appointment, gave great advice (felt honest and we didn't end up doing most expensive option, but he (Rick?) helped us find what was best for us). They scheduled the install for two days later (per our request). Oscar G did the install. He was kind, professional, and talented. We love the product and highly recommend this company. We bought our house a year ago and have found really mixed results in trying to fix it up & we are very happy when a company works out. Price was right, customer service was an A+ and white out window tint looks great. Thanks guys.<//review>< Pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>We recently had  our living, dining , master bath-bedroom windows tinted. A total of 9 windows.  Our reason was to provide privacy and to protect our furniture & wall art from the harsh sun rays. We're completely impressed with the quality of work and professionalism displayed by the team (David, Marco, Oscar).   The turn around time from getting a quote to installation was about 2 days.  My installation was scheduled for 7 am as I've requested.  Two installers (Marco/Oscar) arrived as scheduled and called before ringing the bell. Once inside, they organized their equipment, drop cloths included and  the work was carried out neatly and in a timely manner. My family and I are very impressed with the end product.   We could feel the temperature difference immediately in each room.   We also noticed a change in ambiance giving the rooms  a more calming and relaxing feel.  Initially,   I thought the cost was a little high,  but after reading other reviews and having experienced the excellence in service /quality work,  I have no regrets and would use their service again.   Way to go team Windows Tint LA! Thank you.<//Text><response>{'time': 1437260264178, 'text': "It's our pleasure Marcia.

Window Tint LA is the best! They came to my house and gave a free estimate with no hard sell, answered all my questions and gave a great overview of tint options. I called several times with more questions and each time I was greeted with a courteous response. I researched other tints and the product Window Tint LA uses is definitely superior. Oscar, the installer was very professional and tidy. I absolutely recommend Window Tint LA!< /Review>

I give Oscar R.  a five star rating for his professionalism, competency, and great way of dealing and showing respect for customers. He shows up on time and did his job perfectly. I am very happy with the outcome of the way he had placed the tint on my business doors and window. He even gave me a free ammonia-free tint glass cleaner and instructed me thoroughly on how to clean them.  Kudos Oscar. Keep up the good work and thank you so very much for a job well done.<//text>

<text>Window Tint LA did a great job at our home. Oscar and Roger arrived on time and made sure that everything in our home was protected during the installation. They did a really professional job installing the window  film and we can already see, and feel, the difference with the heat and UV light reduced throughout our house. They got the job done quickly and made sure everything was clean when they were finished. We couldn't be more pleased with Window Tint LA and will definitely recommend them to our friends and family.<//text>< user_name>

I never even thought a home window tinting company could wow me...until now.  Within a few hours of making a request for a consultation via Yelp, it was booked, easy breezy, no drama and confirmed in a super professional and earnest way by Erik ( not sure if he is the owner but by the way he cared about me as a customer, I wouldn't be surprised). On the day the sales person was arriving for the consult, I received a call from Peter as agreed to within 30 min of arrival.  Peter asked great questions to understand (and not assume) why I wanted the windows in my home tinted.  Because I only wanted UV and some heat ( to prevent discoloration) he pulled out two sample options and we used tape to see it up on the window.  He took his time to make sure I really liked it and then he was diligent and detailed about the measurements for the windows we decided to tint ( he even said it would be overkill to put tint on some new windows that were low-e already- this was a customer oriented message and one that would cost him commission but I knew I could trust him after that.) once Oscar arrived on time as promised, he took his time all day to make sure all the films were cut to perfection, that the application was flawless and that I was happy with it.  The process doesn't look hard, but if you have ever seen bad tint jobs, you know that a lot of experience goes a long way and Oscar was not only technically good, but he along with every person you meet along the way was a genuinely good person you know you can trust.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this company to anyone.  High quality company, people, products, service at a fair and competitive price.  Thank you!</review>

There are no words to explain how incredible this company performed. They covered every aspect from A to Z. Management contacted us at a timely matter and sent out representatives to take correct measurements as well as provide a free consultation. They were very helpful in assisting us choose the correct type of tint for our office. Joe was the Senior Installer that installed our tinting. He was very prompt and efficient. He was a very kind gentleman that was very pleasant to work with. I could not rave about this company enough. I highly recommend them for any job. You won't be disappointed!< /text>

Window Tint LA didn't come in lowest but they we definitely the most comprehensive. Max came to quote and he took time to offer options and insights. The install went smoothly and very quickly.

We chose Window Tint LA after a pretty exhaustive search of companies.  We are very satisfied with the service and the result.  The cost was fair and management was receptive to our concerns about the ultimate bill.
Our installer, Roger, was very competent,  a gentleman, and kept our home clean.   The result is amazing--the glare of the sum is drastically reduced and our home is cooler.
We recommend that before the installation that you have a handyman seal the windows with glaziers putty.  This serves to add to the effect of the job by reducing noise.<//Review>

Window Tint came in to give us a good quote on two windows and was able to install the tint on the same day. They have quality film and their Senior Installer Oscar R. was super professional and his work was spot on. Great job Window Tint LA!<//review>

The installer who came out, Oscar R., measured and explained the advantages of this film.  He made me feel comfortable this film would work in preventing my lawn from burning once replaced for the second time.  He came back two days later, installed the film and did an excellent job.  He was quite knowledgeable, professional and efficient.<//text>< pics>

We've thought about having the windows tinted in our new home for the past 2 years. Finally we decided to go ahead and make the investment.

When I called to Window Tint LA, I was extremely pleased that they still had all of our information in their database from when the sales consultant first visited us. Scheduling was easy.

Oscar and Rudy arrived on time and answered all of our questions. We had originally decided to go with 60% on our single pane windows, however after talking it through and Oscar and Rudy understanding our goal we went with the 40%. They even put up a sample of both so we could compare on our windows.

Oscar and Rudy's work was done professionally, and everything was left very clean. I was very impressed!

We couldn't be happier with their work and we plan on having the rest of our windows done in the near future.

He was polite and extremely respectful of my house. He put on booties to cover his shoes as we walked through the house to the living room and kitchen windows I wanted tinted. He put up samples of the different films and I could actually feel the heat differences between them as they blocked the sun's rays. I decided to go with the Ceramic 30. Their turnaround time for installation was quick. The cherry on top is that the film is dye free and comes with a lifetime warranty. You can't ask for better than that. Thank you Neil and Window tint LA for your awesome customer service & top notch product!< /text><resp>{'time': 1438009220184, 'text': "Thank you for the positive feedback.

Window Tint LA did an amazing job on my front house windows! My experience from start to finish was A+.
Previously due to security concerns I kept my blinds closed at all times, but now they are open 24/7 thanks to the option of having the frost film installed as well as the heat reduction, excellent and fast installation, lifetime warranty and increased privacy!!!<//Text>

First impression was their web site, second was the customer service when I called for an estimate and then the installation. The web site was very professional easy to navigate, the customer service on the phone was very pleasant and courteous. Always called to update me on my order. Lastly Oscar R who came with his assistant for the installation was professional and answered some questions which I forgot to ask the Rep. Reading the positive reviews on their pamphlet and on Yelp made me realize I made the right choice .< /review>

He was on time, efficient,  explained thoroughly about the tint we chose, discussed maintenance and answered all of our questions.  He did a great job cleaning up afterwards, couldn't even tell he had been there.  What a hard worker, just kept at it room by room.

I also want to acknowledge Max who did our estimate a few days ago.  Again, professional, knowledgeable and really sold the product.

Our windows looks great and we are delighted with this product line. We'd recommend Window Tint LA,  Roger and Max to everyone.<//Review><rating>5</rating>< user>

The installer Oscar G. is excellent in his service.  Very detail and meticulous to make sure the glass is clean free of dirt before the application of the Hanita Tek 8 mil security film.  After the application you will ask whether there is really an application because it is just that clear.  Highly recommended for all your windows tinting needs.< /text>

<review>Window Tint LA is fantastic. I couldn’t be happier with how my windows turned out. Rick came out twice to do my bid because I was confused about which windows i should do, which was so kind of him. Roger the installer was super nice and worked hard all day to finish what was a pretty big job. I’ve used other tinting companies and no one has come close to the quality job Window Tint LA did. I highly recommend them!!! A+++</review>< Pictures>

Oscar R,  was here today at our facility to put on anti graffiti film cover. Our office opens at 9am and he was here at 8:00 am he was prompt to arrive and ready to work. He was very quick and professional . Our Windows look amazing and we will definitely be using them in the future and also we will recommend Oscar R, to our other facilities. Very affordable and it was a pleasure doing business with window tint LA ! 5 stars!</text>

The Huper Optik 50 was exactly what we needed - the next day on a southern exposure there was no heat near the windows however the outside deck was very hot.

Chose these guys for a residential window tint and film in the bathroom based solely off online reviews.  Initially was impressed with the response and follow up that led to the meeting for a price quote.   Estimate seemed a bit high at first but figured it was worth it with all the good reviews to get the job done right.

The installers arrived as scheduled and called before knocking on the door which I appreciated.  So the install begins for the tint on a bay window and some privacy film on a bathroom window.  I work on the laptop in another room while the installers do their thing and give them their space.  2 hours later I get the tap on the shoulder they're done, so I give it a look and from a distance everything looks good,  So I write the check and they're on their way.  I go to inspect closer and notice that the wood floors under the bay window they did was soaked with the over spray and droppings of the liquid they used to apply the window tint.  It's a mess my wife ends up having to take a half hour to clean with the Swifter.

I go up to the bathroom to inspect the film install and see that the toilet under the window they worked on has been displaced about an inch.  So I have to have the toilet re-seated with a new wax ring to make sure there's no leaks.  All in all, you may think, not a big deal but it was a huge disappointment to me.  Such a simple thing to clean up after yourself or lay a cover down at the get go so there's nothing to clean up in the first place.  And if you move a toilet like that, let the owner know and deal with it instead of acting like nothing happened and bailing on it.

7/9/15- Update
Today I received a call from David, one of the owners, inquiring about this issue. I was impressed with his concern over the problem and going to the length he did to make it right.  He was passionate about his service being great and assured me this was to be addressed with his installers.  I wasn't big on ever using them again but the fact they addressed the problem and in the manner they did I would definitely consider them again. If there's a problem and no solution, I'm done with them. I'm in the service industry and understand there will be issues but to me it's not so much the issue, rather how it's handled.  David stepped up and dealt with this head on and I not only respect that but admire it. These guys truly stand behind their work, no matter what that takes.  Originally a 2 star review changed to 4.< /text>

We used them on our house in Hermosa Beach.  They were very professional. Everyone showed up on time and worked quickly and efficiently within the time frames provided. Everyone answered all of our questions.  Oscar was very careful and detailed when it came to the installation. Definitley recommend them for your window tinting.</Review>

Oscar was prompt and started to work immediately after checking out the windows and explaining what he was going to do and how.  He worked very quickly and very neatly -- no messes left behind.  He was very patient  with me since I could not clear the house as much as I had wanted.  He said it was OK and went right to work.  After the lengthy installation, he gathered all his stuff and then came back for my tutorial and care instructions, which was greatly appreciated.  He was very friendly and businesslike.  He knew his product and it's installation.  I highly recommend this company and especially Oscar for window tinting<//Text>

Wish I would have called this company first! I originally had my two picture windows in my kitchen tinted by another company and it turns out they used cheap car window tint which started changing colors after only 3 years. What a waste of money. Did I mention the new tint has a lifetime warranty? Thanks David!</text>

<text>They don't actually sell kabobs, they just give you pieces of meat. They also tack on an additional "livable wage" charge to all orders since they're too cheap to pay their staff. I live directly above this place and will never go back. Learn how to price your food accordingly to pay your staff instead of peddling it off on customers, anyone that lazy is clearly cutting corners elsewhere.</text>< username>

The chicken seemed to not be cooked completely and was a bit bland. The rice used to have a lot more saffron (yellow grains) and flavour before but was still decent. I have been here before and had enjoyed this very same dish a lot but I guess this time it was more of a let down for me this time or maybe I came in with too high expectations. Had ordered the chicken kabab plate. Service was good and ordered fresh juice which was really nice.< /Text>

I have been to  this restaurant about 5 times, mostly a  popular place for company get togethers. The venue is excellent for large gatherings. Yes they have a bars with variety drink selections. So if you  want a nice place with  food that everyone can enjoy, Mediterranean style with a bit of Persian influence then this is a place to come. They also have pizza which is average when it comes to flavor.  No wow factor in the pizza. The ingredients are good and fresh.  The service is good.  The food in terms of flavoring and execution is average. I have had much better kebabs in many other Persian or Afghani restaurants  throughout the bay area. The marination is simpler and blander in flavor than other places I have been to. But, the quality of the ingredients is good. They have good starters and finger food for those who want to just have something light and drinks in a group.The menu is balanced and does have some good selections for everyone to try. Do I crave to go to this restaurant for the food ever?  Never but if  I had no where else to go ,  yes I would come here to eat as a viable option. My rating for this place is 3.5 but I will  round  it to 4 just for ambience and quality of ingredients plus I cannot give a 3.5 :) rating on google review.</text>

Great outdoor patio with ample of seating space.

I had spicy shrimp for the appetizer and it was great !!

I ordered the Rack of Lamb which was very  bland.

Their sampler for desert is great & I highly recommend it !!

Our server was awesome. I'd definitely come back and try another en·trée.</Text>

Bartender seemed a bit novice and was really slow at getting our drinks.  This is not indicative of all their servers as some seemed really prompt and senior.  Food was slightly above average but not necessarily outstanding.  An overall good experience.< /Review>< username>

Stopped here for lunch on our way to Carmel. What a great find. Staff was very welcoming and we were seated right away. They brought out pita bread and cucumber salad then an additional tray of hummus, baba  ganoush and tzatiki. Everything was delicious so far!

We ordered a chicken sandwich and a chicken kabob for lunch.

The chicken kabob came with saffron rice and broccoli. Yum. Everything cooked well and chicken was tender and juicy.

Sandwich had avocado, lettuce, tomato and onion with an aioli served on a toasted soft roll. Delicious.

We were glad we made the detour here to have lunch. Yum!</text>

<review>This place is wonderful. I come here often for lunch and always get great food and service. Tonight I had a meeting run late and missed my train. Decided to grab a glass of wine and order the very yummy spicy vegetarian pizza which is the best! The bartender was so friendly and kind. He made sure I always had a full glass whether it was water or wine. Simply put. Excellent service.

They have private rooms in the back so they are great for group/team events.  Casual/nice atmosphere.  The din of the dining room seemed overly loud.  In the private rooms it was fine.  The food was tasty and service solid.<//review>

<Text>Supposed to be a Mediterranean place but you can get pizza, kabob, pasta and everything. Great ambience but super super slow service. We waited for long long time for order, food and someone to collect the check (more than 20 min) even when it wasn't crowded at all. They were busy cleaning other tables. Food is okay.</Text>< user>

Service is good. The braised lamb shank was phenomenal, but some of the menu items fall short.

Chicken, lamb and ground beef skewers were bland and dry.

Hendrick's gin and tonic was $16, served in shot sized glass filled to the brim with ice.  One swallow and the drink was gone.

For the price I expect more.<//Text>

<review>Here's why I'm giving this wonderful bistro 4 stars.the evening began with being greeted by an attractive, friendly hostess, who took care of my needs, the moment I walked in the door. So, that set the tone, then the food that followed, delivered by a conscientious waitress, was just awesome. If you like Mediterranean food, like I do, you'll love this place, from the ambience, to the personalized attention. Yeah. I'll be back......< /review></record>

Faz is alright. I was here for lunch on a weekday and we were seated immediately. The service was decent and the food came out rather quickly. I had the rolled beef kebab. I have no idea why it was called rolled beef. The beef wasn't as... savory as I'm used to and the consistency was a little too soft and had me questioning what the composition was of the meat. $15 was a little too much for what you get in return, but it's close to work so it makes a convenient lunch spot. I wasn't a huge fan of this place and wouldn't go out of my way to come here again. The flavors, quality of food and portion size are absolutely none in comparison to a place like Dish Dash.<//text>

I and my wife have long wanted to go to this place, since we live in the apartment right above the restaurant! And finally one night we decided to turn up here. This is quite a unique restaurant in the sense that it caters multiple cuisines - Italian, Persian, American and others.

We decided to try out the chef's soup of the day - a seafood gumbo soup which turned out to be absolutely delicious. As appetizers, we tried out the combo kabab from the usual dinner menu and a kashk-e bademjan based dish from a special menu. The combo kabab had one beef kabab and a chicken kabab which were absolutely delectable, succulent and mouth-watering. One particular aspect that I noticed is that the portion sizes of the kabob plates are smaller than ones in other Persian restaurants in the vicinity (read DishDash, Chellokababi and similar ones). The special entree was a little off-key to our taste.

The service was really great, we enjoyed our time here and the interior is quite classy. I plan to be back here to try the pizzas.</Review>

The food and service here is really good.  The only minor complaint that I have is that the “Greek Salad” is the American version, which is lettuce based.  In my travels to Greece, most of the Greek Salads were mainly tomatoes, with very little or no lettuce at all.  I would love to find a place that serves an “authentic” Greek Salad.</Text>

< Review>
We came here because we had a gift card. And thank goodness we had a card...it was soooo overpriced!! It was really dead for a Friday night, but the service was good. We got the Mediterranean platter for the appetizer, which was pretty good. Then we each got a kabob. The kabob wasn't bad (not superb either though), but $24 for one small bit of meat, a few green beans, and a ridiculous amount of rice?? Waaayyyy too overpriced. For 1 appetizer, 2 main courses and 1 glass of wine, it cost $88!!! Are you kidding me? And kabobs are pretty much the only main courses available. Do yourself a favor and go a little down the road to Dish Dash if you want Mediterranean food that's worth the price.< /Review>
<Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1559175437892, 'text': "Rachael, we're sorry you expected lower prices, but we use fresh, high-quality ingredients that naturally cost a little bit more. We never want to sacrifice the taste and quality of our food.

First time here, I work down the street, was not impressed, rice was cold and dry, lamb was not seasoned, plate was cold. Service was ok, but I felt that it could have been better.< /text>

Good food but service was meh.  It's loud inside so having a conversation is a bit difficult. So loud that I pointed to the food I wanted off the menu.  Server forgot my soup.  Said he couldn't hear me since it was too loud.  Remember I pointed to my food.  I wasn't angry but I got attitude from the server.  It also took 40 minutes to get out main dish.</text>

<review>Great Persian Food. I love Persian food because it has lots of herbs and spices but No Chilies! And they have other things there as well. My son the pizza eater, loved his pizza. My husband who loves things hot enjoyed his shrimp appetizer, since he is a light dinner person, it was more than enough for him. We'll definitely be back.</review>< user>

Ordered the Paneer Kabob! Taste was really mild and Paneer was not well done not battered or blended with spices very well.

<Review>We usually end up going here as my office is close by. It's a good 10 min walk which is always needed on our way back. We usually get the hummus and pita for the table which is absolutely delicious . I always end up ordering the chicken kebob and they have the option of selecting the brown meat over white...which works out great for me.
Not sure about the parking scenario here as ive always just walked to this place.
I kinda wish they had more kebob and mixed platter options. Ambience is nice and the service is always great.< /Review>< pics>

Try the hummus and follow with a lamb steak. Just the right ammount of spices to hit the spot. We did not get dessert but had some very well made cappuccinos!<//text>< Pics>

The restaurant is located near a residential area so parking is located on the ground floor of the complex, and one should take a spot labeled 'employee retail' retail parking. The service was friendly, and the chicken entre I had was delicious. The portions may not be as big compared to other Persian restaurants but the quality of the food makes up for this. I would dine here again.< /Text>

<Review>The Cosmopolitan was salty and not chilled enough, we complained to the waitress, she came back with another glass and told very sorry the bartender added the salt he thought was sugar in the drink.
The flat bread was cold and hard, we asked the waitress to bring some warm bread, waited for more than 10 mins and came the same cold and hard plate.
The battered calamari was totally plain without any flavor and  salt added, and it came wrapped under a folded napkin on the plate!!
Lamb shank was stewed only and totally no flavor at all, the mixed rice under was cold and hard too.
Filet Mignon in the Chenjeh was so well done and with totally charcoal burned veggies on the skewer.
The waitress brought desert menu and told, they did not have tiramisu and cheese cake.
We, group of 5, came around 7:30 for Sat night dinner, just us and another table of guests.  So empty, maybe that's why the moonlighting cook and bartender were on duty!!<//Review>< pictures>

Came for a team dinner of over 50 people. Starter were over in 10 min, no one bother to replace them.

Entree was as bad as it can be. Dry veggies grilled with dry rice no lentils.

Run away, that is my recommendation.</text>
