Best Prices In The 805 Hands Down 🙌🏻... Called them up on a Thursday... He ordered my windshield in for my 2017 Chevy Trax & on the same day he installed my windshield in what felt like less then an hour. Will definitely be coming back if I ever need any windshield repairs. Highly recommend< /Review>

<Text>The name says it all. Right off the 126 at Briggs ez to get to. Owner operator, drop off or wait. Most windshields installed in 1 hour. Mobile service is also available. Open 7days a week till 5pm. Racks of glass on site. He has yours. This is the place. One stop.

<text>Sam is a great owner very nice! Had some hiccups but still got it done for a very reasonable price. Owner and worker with him got it done quick and even vacuumed out as much as they could. Would highly recommend this place to anyone!!!! There is no waiting area but he does have fold out chairs.</text><resp>None< /resp>< UserId.>

Sam is outstanding at his job! He is delegent about keeping his inventory stocked and he is great about fitting people in on emergency same day drop ins.  Not to mention be is efficient, professional, reliable, and offers the best prices out there.  I highly recommend Low Price Auto Glass Sam and his dedicated staff beat out all the rest out there.<//text>

Have used him before, I will recommend him to all needing this type of service. Hopefully I won't have to use him again but would not hesitate if the need arises.< /review>< pictures>

Sam, the owner, gave my husband and I excellent service.  After our first telephone conversation, he quickly ordered a windshield for my 1991 Dodge W250 pickup truck without even asking for a deposit.  I guess my husband sounded honest on the phone.  The installation went very smoothly and the price was right.  I recommend him strongly, and be fair to him and make an appointment as a significant portion of his business is mobile glass replacement.</review>

If I could give Sam 10 stars I would. He was amazing, he came all the they to Simi Valley at 7:15 in the morning to replace my rear window.
Would and will highly recommend his business to everyone ever needing a glass replacement

This has been the third windshield that they have replaced for me. They have great service and amazing prices. The owner was very helpful and didn't sugar coat anything. He warned me about the possibly of warn trim pieces that may break during the process before they even started. He was able to do the work on time and when was able to get me several different choices for my windshield. Fortunately no damage was done to the warm trim pieces. He was the only company that I talked to that warned me about the possibilities of damage. Hands down the best company around if you are in the need of replacement. I recommend anyone and everyone to use this company. From arrival to departure it only took an hour. 5 ⭐️ rating</text>

Absolutely the best! Great price, fast service and no frills. Keeps the costs down and Sam is a cool guy. If I could give 10 stars I would. Don't expect a fancy shop, free coffee or a restroom. But I got a rear window for my FX45 almost $200 lower than the next competitor. That's important to me.</review>

If you ever need a replacement window for your automobile, I definitely recommend this place. Installation is fairly quick, prices are affordable, and always great work done.<//text>

After getting quotes at two other businesses I went to Low Price Auto Glass, saved a substantial amount of money and the windshield they installed on my 2003 BMW was distortion free. You will not find a less expensive place. Plus, they got to me right away without having a appointment. If you want to save money, and who doesn't, call Low Price Auto Glass!!!!<//review>

<review>Someone smashed my side window in my Focus.  Needed replacement ASAP.  Called another company, gave a quote of $235 and a weeks wait!  Called car dealer, same thing, turns out they use the company I originally called to do their windows.  Friend reccommended Low Price Auto Glass, called, spoke to Sam, the owner, very nice on phone, quoted $100 for used window installed, or $140 new installed, I was almost in shock, too good to be true.
Said come on out, he'd do it right away!  WOW!  I had heard the shop wasn't fancy and its not, but didn't care, just wanted it done.  When I got there Sam apologized, said he should have ask for the model, as my car had 2 different window styles that year, but he had a temporary replacement, stuck it in in about 5 min., worked ok till the next day when he got me a new one.  Had to wait about 1 hr, install took about 30 min., same exact window as the original
ones, $140 cash, done, very curtious workers, smiling, answered my questions.  Will always use them in the future.  Highly reccommend them.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80e9b4dc7d167e6f:0x81b95c8b2be7cf32< /Gmap_id></record>

I would have given 5 stars but we we're kinda surprised after the install when we were told they only accept cash. I wish someone would have told us over the phone when we called to make our appointment.< /review>

Well i went there to fix my back window on my Mazda 6 and the guy there was really friendly, he fixed the window and i got a good conversation with him.  I am not one to care too much fancy places if they cant do it right, and believe me this place does it right without being fancy.</Review>

They fixed the back window (sliding) on my full size dodge for $100 with stock tint. Labor included and all. If I had gone to the dealer it would have costed me $400 installed. No thanks. In and out within thirty minutes. Definitely would recommend this place to anyone!! Best prices in Ventura county!</review>

I got there right when they were closing up, they were literally getting into their cars to go home.  They saw the condition my car was in and didn't want me driving with half of a windshield, they finished in 30 minutes and the price was great, that was the third time I've used their services and have never been disappointed. Excellent place.< /Review>

<Text>I had a leak in my windshield. I called them and we set up an appointment for them to come and install a new one at my home at 10:00 A.M...10:00 comes and goes, then 10:30 I call them close to 11:00 and they apologize and tell me that they will come at 4:00 p.m. instead...4:00 comes and goes then 4:30 still no one showed up and I didn't receive a call, they are also not answering when I try to call. No idea what happened, guess I have to find someone else to do the job.<//Text>< pictures>

I called the week after and the same thing happened again. I called a week after once again and they said they would come the day after and i called 2 hours after the time they gave me and they said the repair man would arrive 2-3 hour later and they once again did not come. i suggest you take your time and money else where, by far the worst customer service i have ever recieved.<//Review><date>1356737613217< /date><rate>2</rate><response>None</response><userid>110463942870815439381<//userid>< username>

Horrible. We had an appointment scheduled to replace our windshield and they never showed. Kept giving the round around. Never called us said they would call back never did and then blamed a worker for breaking the windshield hours later. Never will call them back.< /text>

<user>106391742420876163828</user><review>I have been working out here for 3 years and I still get excited to go in for my workouts! I’ve been to other 9Round locations (sadly bc I moved away for a year) and I can say there is something special about the Natomas location. The trainers here are friendly, but they also know what they’re doing and will challenge you. Keba is amazing, she takes the time to get to know her members and to make sure they’re happy. It’s so much easier for me to push myself to lift heavier or punch harder knowing I only have to do it for 3 minutes at a time 🤪. I get a much better workout in 30 minutes here than I would if I was left to my own devices in a regular gym. I can’t say enough good things about my favorite gym!<//review>< GmapID>

Such a great and encouraging environment. The trainers are very friendly and always available to help. I never knew I would love doing kickboxing but this place makes me feel like like family and helping me to reach my goal of being fit and healthy.  Definitely recommend trying it out even if you’re not into boxing. You might change your mind. :)<//Review>

I’ll never go back to a traditional gym setting. Since I joined 9round over 2 1/2 years ago this has been my go to and is the best workout I’ve ever experienced. Hard work + commitment = results🥊</text>

<Text>This team is incredible! I was visiting Sacramento for work and the team here was incredibly open to training me and kept me engaged the entire time. I was happy to be challenged and treated like another member even though I come from a different 9R location. If you want a great workout with upbeat, kind and funny trainers who will keep you on your toes, this is the location to be at. Thank you 9R Natomas!< /Text>< Resp>

Keba is the best!  She makes sure we are all taken care of! She has a presence in the he gym which makes me feel like care cares for her business, her members and her community! She makes sure there are plenty of trainers to keep us motivated and busy! Plus her trainers are all very good at what they do! Best place to workout!<//review>

I have been a member since they opened in Natomas 2 years ago and I still love it and look forward to going every time. The workout is hard, results are obvious and it is so much fun! Plus, you get to punch stuff. I would recommend everyone try it at least once! You will be hooked.<//review>

The trainers i have met are each amazing and it really does feel like they care.I can talk to them about the physical problems I have and they can easily suggest a modification to my work out. This to me goes a long way, it just feels like they really do care for my health and fitness.I enjoy the fact that I can go when I want, and the morning workout I do on Tuesdays-Thursday have helped me feel energized and ready for the day.I also enjoy that the website has a nutrition guide and even meal planners.This was the first gym I signed up for that has made me want to stay.Everyday I feel like I am getting to be, a stronger and healthier me.<//Review>

<Review>I can workout on my own schedule, don’t have to sign up or arrive early to make sure I get into a class. Emily and Tomas are super motivating they push me in my workouts.

Since I joined 9Round, I love working out and committed. 30 min goes by so fast and I have noticed improvements in my physical and emotional health. I am so much more confident now. The trainers are supportive and great. There are some trainers that I prefer because they push me to work harder. I also like the fact that I can track my results on the screeen during my workout in addition to the emails with workout summary. This is how I monitor my progress. I started with a 3 month membership and for sure will be renewing.</review>< Pictures>

I’ve been working out at 24 Hour Fitness for almost 8 years & never made a consistent commitment in losing weight. Since joining 9 Round - Natomas, I’ve lost 25 lbs & kept it off. I love the unique circuit training 9 Round offers & the staff is awesome! In addition, I made a new found appreciation with MMA, boxing & Muay Thai. Anyways, I would recommend this spot to anyone who love to have a new challenge in their fitness journey. Shout out to Keba, Tohua, Joaquin, Nick, Mickey, Sergio, Alex & the rest of the staff in making this spot super fun to workout!< /Text>< rate>

It turns out that a workout can be challenging AND fun.  Who knew?  I love that there are no set classes or class times.  This place will work for ANY fitness level and any age.  Keba and her trainers are supportive while also pushing members to work hard and grow.  It's a winning combination.  This is the first time in my 50+ years that I've actually enjoyed exercise and looked forward to going to the gym.  I love this place.</text>

All the trainers are amazing to work with they guide you and push you without over intimidating you. Their motivation and upbeat personalities help get you through a very challenging 30 minutes!

I love the fact that they know who you are and greet you as soon as you walk in the door and when you leave they make sure to let you know how you did and say goodbye no matter how busy it gets. There are no set workout times so you know as soon as you walk in the door and you are ready to go they will get you on the floor and working out the next available round!

Even on days that I don't feel like going I tell myself it's only 30 minutes and I force myself to go and not once have I ever regretted it. And Hey! If 30 minutes isn't enough for you you can go another 30!!!! Great stress reliever and it definitely boosts your confidence!</text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>I've been going here for one month now. I love the concept of 30-40 minute high intensity workouts that are not dull or boring. The staff is excellent they help push you to your limits every time. I have an injury and they customize the workouts around it. As a result I've seen great results in just a month and with no pains from my injury. I highly recommend 9round for any fitness level. I see everything from advanced to beginner and everyone seems to get a great workout in. I'm hooked and go 6 days a week now. Give 9round a try, your first workout is free.< /review>< pictures>

9Round is an Awesome full body workout with no set class times. I am notorious for running late, but, I can be on time for this fitness routine any day. The trainers are very professional and Keba is fabulous. I smile, sweat, burn calories, and have fun all at the same.< /Text>

Full body workout in 30 min. Im already sweating by round 2. Everyone knows my name, are very helpful, and are great when I need to do a modification because of my knee. I can do a regular jumping jack now. And I even got my 16 year old loving to go.<//review>

Love this place!  The trainers all know their stuff, and keep you motivated and giving your all while keeping it fun (except when it’s time for burpees. I hate burpees!). I’ve seen great results and go thru withdrawal when I can’t get there at least 4x a week. Highly recommend.< /review>

The owner is amazing, very communicative. We order tires, rims, and lugnuts, and knew when everything was received and he got us in in a very timely manner. The prices are incredible, the service is incredible, and my car looks amazing!
Thank you!<//Review>

< review>
With my previous dentist I felt I was not getting the quality care I needed. I told my wife we should find another dentist. My wife was seen by Pebble Beach because she was having problems with some work our previous dentist performed. She was impressed by Dr Atherly and his staff. She also mentioned the modern equipment. I feel that was the best decision we made. They developed a treatment plan for us that erased years of dental problems. My wife is over the top with how great her teeth look and we both are so happy to finally have perfect dental health. I highly recommend Pebble Beach due to their competence in addition to always making you feel welcome.< /review>

I found Pebble Beach Dental on line.  Looked through pics and saw Dr. Atherly's family and staff. Looked like a great place, so made a call.  Best decision I made.  Staff is so friendly and professional and my experience to date has been wonderful.<//review>

Very professional very nice very clean
I had extensive dental work done and did not feel one ounce of pain everything was explained to me a very calming wonderful experience. High quality of work.

That's saying a lot coming from me cuz I usually don't like the dentist but I like this Dental office and staff.<//review>

The one time I was actually excited to go to the dentist. Changed my view on my fears for sure, the numbing cream was a god send I didn’t even feel the needle go in.

The staff from the front desk to the back rooms are all a blessing and will make anyone feel comfortable. THESE GUYS ARE AWESOME 👏🙌🏻<//text>

<Text>They’re like family. Stephanie is more than accommodating with working with our insurance company and treatments my family may need. Dr. A is fantastic and had squeezed me in in an emergency manner with a broken venere. Melissa takes great care and detail in my 6 month cleanings. I wouldn’t dream of going anywhere else & have recommended friends, neighbors and coworkers.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1621012001602, 'text': 'Thanks so much for the kind words, Natalie!'}< /resp>< gmap_id>

I have been in search of a new dentist for a long time and I finally found a great dental office. I have major anxiety when I go to the dentist and I have been to several different offices and none of my experiences have been great.  I came to this office in September for a cleaning and all of the staff were kind and friendly. They walk you through everything step by step and make sure you stay comfortable the entire time. I had to come back in October to have a tooth removed and they honestly cared about me and my anxiety. They made sure I was relaxed and comfortable and that I would not feel a thing. Thank you so much Pebble Beach Dental, your staff is amazing!

I have been seeing Dr. Atherly since he moved to the area and he is amazing....very gentle. He has done several crowns for me and they look great. He even came into the office during a holiday week to extract a tooth. I wouldn’t think of going anywhere else.< /Text>

Dr. Atherly and the staff at PBD are awesome!! They are always friendly, and exceptionally respectful professionals! They use modern techniques and technologies including digital x-rays and e-mail and text reminders. They are always mindful of my insurance and timing for scheduling appointments. I have been to see them before and during COVID practices and they are a clean office with patient safety and care at heart.<//Text>

<Review>During the covid crisis my usual dentist was closed and I needed an emergency filling. I looked up local dentists and came across Pebble beach dentistry.  The staff was so helpful and sweet and the Dr took care of my issue right away, was very kind and did a great job!

After my visit I immediately signed up the rest of my family for a visit too. I highly recommend this office!<//Review>< Pics>

I’ve been going to Dr Atherley’s office since he took over Pebble Beach Dental.  All of his staff are excellent.  The hygienists are thorough and great at educating me, without making me feel bad!  The office is relaxing and hygienic and I’ve never felt in pain.  I would recommend this office to anyone looking for a quality dental experience.</review>

If you are looking for a great dentist and they have an opening for new patients be quick and join in.  I have never recommended a dentist until now.  The quality care my teeth have received drives the FIVE STAR rating.  The staff is friendly and professional and they do GREAT work.  I truly appreciate the administrative team and how they work with me and my schedule and how they research the financial charges and give you straight answers!  No surprise charges - at a dentist!!!! That is a WOW!!!  Thank you!< /text>

<review>Well, I've put off going to the dentist for nearly seven years until I was finally convinced to come in and try out Pebble Beach Dental.

From start to finish it was an enjoyable experience. Kimberly did  a my first cleaning and offered a combination of professionalism and constant education that resulted in a non traumatic morning in which I will actually utilize the information she shared to keep my teeth healthier.

I signed up for my follow up appointments, and while I may not be looking forward to them (still the dentist), I'm definitely not dreading them.</review><GmapID>0x809ade190deb7191:0x4dcfa62932b8cc2f<//GmapID><user_id>102314694382161565170</user_id>< response>

<review>I have been coming here for a few years now and have always had a wonderful experience. The staff do a great job of scheduling, sending out reminders, and being flexible if a change in appointment is needed. The dental exams, cleanings, and other services have been professional and thorough in my opinion. For not having dental insurance, I generally pay with my HSA card or credit card and the charges are reasonable. The waiting room is comfortable though I rarely need to wait. Five stars all around!<//review><Gmap_id>0x809ade190deb7191:0x4dcfa62932b8cc2f</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Absolutely love everyone in here! They're all so sweet and happy to see all the patients. You can really feel the genuine love here, they do great work, Dr. Atherly is wonderful with extractions and really knows what he's doing. The office is close by, recently expanded, and they don't mind if your shoes track in some unwelcome extras...ahem.

Really an office you just have to experience yourself, you'll leave with a smile (a clean one, at that!)<//Text>

< Review>
never would have neglected my teeth. The staff and Dr are truly kind, caring and professional. I came in without insurance, in pain only expecting to get relief from that but I felt welcomed from the very first call I made to them. I am now having much needed work taken care of. The Dr. has a gentle touch and even the drilling was as comfortable as possible. No nasty decay flying all over my mouth. The assistant doesn't let you drown before using the suction either. I'm truly very thankful to have found them.</Review>

Great response rate from administrative staff, they are attentive and friendly. My hygienist, Melissa, is a rockstar. Overall they provide good dental care. I like that they open early and can get me in without disrupting my work day too much.< /Text>

This is a dentist office like no other! They use the latest and greatest technology in their office. I am a person that always dreaded going to the dentist because I didn’t like the poking and scratching and all of the outdated dental techniques. Here at Pebble Beach Dental it is completely different, and it makes me look forward to coming in to get my teeth cleaned or clear correct checked! They provide excellent care to each and every one of their patients! Starting right when you walk in the door, you are greeted with a smile and a warm welcome. The hygienists are amazing and so friendly and truly care about you as a person! Dr.Atherly is so amazing at his job and he takes his time to make sure that every single procedure is done correctly. The entire Pebble Beach Dental staff cares about their patients and the care they receive. If you are looking for a new dentist, look no further, you will receive amazing care here!</Text>

I absolutely LOVE Pebble Beach Dental!!!! I suffer from extremely bad dental anxiety due to a past dentist visit at my previous dentist and Pebble Beach Dental has been  patient, understanding and helpful with me getting back in the rhythm of being in the dentist chair. I have been going here for about 1.5 years and I’ve received regular cleanings From their dental hygienist, which I love.  I also had a chipped tooth fixed along with a filling and that process couldn’t of gone better (witch I never thought I would say). The Dr. does beautiful work! The entire team is amazing and I highly recommend them!! Thank you Pebble Beach Dental!<//Review>

<resp>None< /resp><Review>I was referred to Pebble Beach Dental by a friend. I was long overdue for a dental cleaning and was a bit nervous to go. From my first experience of calling for an appointment to the end of the visit, I could not have been more pleased with their service. When I called, they happened to have had a cancellation and were able to fit me in the very same day! The receptionists were friendly and welcoming. There was virtually no wait time. My dental hygienist was very kind and excellent at her job. She handed me a mirror after her cleaning and I was amazed at the difference and at how clean and beautiful my teeth looked. All the stains I thought I had to just live with had disappeared completely. Dr. Atherly’s demeanor upon entering was warming and professional. He quickly and efficiently performed my exam. At the end of my visit, I met with the receptionist again to schedule a visit to fix some chips in a couple of my teeth that have been bothering me. Once again, I was met with warmness and caring. They have excellent new patient pricing options that were less expensive than any others I found while searching for a dentist. My next appointments for both the chip fixing and my next 6 month visit have been set. I’m so relieved to be on a regular schedule again for my dental health. I’m extremely happy to have found such a professional and friendly place to call my dental health home. I would highly recommend their services to anyone!<//Review></record>

My experiences at Pebble Beach Dental have all been very positive. Dr. Michael Atherly and his staff are always so friendly and make me feel welcome the minute I step inside the office. I have been going to them for years and my teeth always feel so clean after I walk out of the dental office.< /text>

This is seriously the most friendly dentistry office I've EVER been to! The people at the front desk are always pleasant and remember their clients and are extremely helpful, the dental hygienists are friendly and gentle on those gums, and the dentist is very good at his job! I was so impressed with this place that not only am I a lifelong client, but so is my husband and elderly father!

Their prices are a bit high but comparative to most other dentist offices, and if you have dental insurance they are very good about making sure things go through your insurance first before they do anything.

My father ended up getting a full extraction and a full set of dentures from here and while the price was high (it is anywhere!) they were VERY helpful and compassionate through the whole process. They even would give him phone calls to check up on him and see how he's adjusting!

The ONLY downside to this place is their office is a bit hard to find (which isn't their fault, its how the building is set up) and their waiting room is small. They do the best they can with the small space they have though. Seriously, if you are looking for a new dentist go here!!</text>

<Text>The Pebble Beach Dental team is excellent! You're greeted with a genuine smile into an office that's warm and welcoming. The dental areas have an open floor plan with just enough privacy, and is a big plus regarding everyones personal boundaries. The team is warm and friendly, yet professional. They all have regard for your comfort and a gentle manner. I have dental phobia from my childhood experiences. That said, Pebble Beach Dental is pain free! I'm so pleased to have found them!</Text>< date>

< Review>
I went to Pebble Beach Dental after having some trouble with my past dentist.  Dr. Atherly and his staff are all the epitome of professionalism and quality.  The front desk staff has the perfect combination of personality and efficiency, with a friendly touch in case you're nervous.  They explain what is going to happen, go over your benefits and costs, and make you feel welcome.  The assistants are all knowledgeable and gentle, and keep a light mood while doing great work.  Dr. Atherly is very detailed oriented, does an incredible job, and is very gentle with whatever procedure he is doing.  Everyone works together well and has created a culture where you can tell they are happy with their jobs, and it comes through in the quality of care they give.  Now all my problems from my past dentist are fixed and they have a very happy patient.  I brought my fiancee over to them and will recommend them to all my friends and family.</Review>

<text>I Love Love Pebble Beach Dental!

I started going there around 6 years ago and now 4 members of my family go there and love it too. Two of which hated going to dentists, but not anymore!

Dr. Atherly is such a wonderful person and has a gentle non threatening touch!  His staff are all so positive and personable which makes me feel right at home.

Also, they offer an in-house insurance plan that works great for me and they do not try to sell me something I don't need, which I really appreciate!

Sincerely,

I would definitely recommend to anyone who has Delta Dental PPO to go here. Technician and dentist were very thorough as well as front office staff in regards to billing everything was confirmed with my insurance before I went out the door.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>I highly recommend Pebble Beach Dental. Everyone there is friendly and good at what they do. Dr. Atherly is a great Dentist. They have modern technology and show you any problems on a monitor, so you know it needs to be done, so I never felt they performed unnecessary work.  If you are a bit nervous like me this is a nice, calm office. If you don't have insurance they have a nice plan that can save you money.<//Text>< Name>

<Review>I started going to Pebble Beach Dental this year. Dr. Atherly, DMD is the FIRST Dentist I have had in 50 years that actually does not cause pain. His technique for numbing is litterally painless. On top of this, the dental hiegenist I had for my cleaning also caused no pain. I didn't know this was even possible! They are very professional and when I went in for a crown the dental assistant explained everything she was going to do before she did it. This helped me to know what to expect. I would highly recommend Pebble Beach Dental!< /Review><Name>Patricia Gilsdorf< /Name>< user_id>

PB Dental is the best! All the folks at Pebble Beach Dental are wonderful. I went in this week to have my teeth cleaned by Melissa. She does great work. She's thorough, but gentle and never any pain. Dr. Atherly, who does spectacular work, followed with a quick exam. Then I enjoyed visiting with Stephanie, Shanna, and Tessa while I scheduled my next cleaning. I've been going to this office for a long time and will continue because of the excellent staff and the great work they do.<//review>

Have you been to a dental clinic with family feel and relax atmosphere?This is the one. The staff are awesome. My family and I are very please this dental clinic handle our teeth care. Dr. Atherly is no doubt an A+ dentist. He would call the day after a procedure done, and it was a very comforting feeling. I would recommend this clinic to anyone in a heartbeat.</text>

<Review>I have been using Dr. Atherly's services for the past five years.
I am very impressed with his capabilities and flawless work. So for, he has done four crowns for me which I am very pleased with.

The temporaries prior to crowns were fast, efficient, very comfortable and I had no problem with them.

Also, over the years I developed issues with four other teeth which I thought the only solution would be crowns because of difficulty accessing the problem area of the teeth to work on which were ether under the gum line or between two teeth or both.

To my amazement, Dr. Atherly managed to access the difficult areas of the teeth and restored them just by fillings. Thereby, saving me four crowns.

I really like Dr. Atherly's demeanor which is very calm and relaxed. He gives me his recommendations regarding any treatment that my teeth might need and lets me decide.

Staff, including the Hygienist are very friendly and professional.

I am 62 years of age and have been to at least ten different dentists in Sacramento area in the past twenty years. Based on all the past experiences I feel that I am going to stick with Dr. Atherly for good.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

My husband found this place after doing research because he didn't like the dental office I used to go to. I was so used to it that at first I was hesitant to try a new dental office. Well, my husband did a great job because this place is awesome. Because it is a small office with only one dentist (as far as I know) there is a much friendlier and close-knit feel. The front desk ladies know me and my husband by name and they are so accommodating to health issues or emergencies. They went above and beyond getting my old records from my previous dental office. I always feel comfortable and like I'm getting the best care they can provide.<//review>

Dr. Atherly and the whole team are so amazing. They are the best dental professionals I have ever been to - and I've had my fair share of work done!
They are beyond welcoming, friendly and get to know their patients on a personal level. They use the most state of the art equipment and are simply the best! You will not be disappointed.<//Review>

<Review>TOP NOTCH DENTAL OFFICE!!! My family and I recently moved to the area and were hoping to establish a relationship with a dentist/team we felt secure and comfortable with. Pebble Beach was recommended to us by a coworker who swore by their services and promised we’d be happy with the outcome. And because they were so right, this is my attempt to pay it forward and do the same for anyone in need of a new/better dentist. Between the three of us, we’ve now experienced cleanings (including my 4 year old sons first cleaning), a front chipped tooth repaired, two cavities filled and a full tooth extraction (lower back molar) and not a single bad thing to say! Seriously, how rare and cool is that?

From the front desk/staff to the assistants/hygienists and all the way up to Dr. Atherly, they ALL have consistently been super friendly (while maintaining their professionalism) and they take the time to ensure you are fully aware of your options and that you understand the procedures beforehand. Additionally, they offer the convenience of text confirmations and appointment setting for those who prefer.

Overall, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PBD and Dr. Atherly for any/all dental needs and trust that he has my family’s best interest in mind. Do yourself a favor and give them a try, you truly won’t regret it.

Thank you Dr. Atherly and team, you guys are awesome and we appreciate the great care and hospitality you’ve shown us.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

< review>
I changed dentists about a year ago to Pebble Beach dental, and they've been awesome. I will never go anywhere else. I've had great cleanings from knowledgeable nurses that really give you good advise on gums health and OTC teeth whitening products. I had a filling replaced that I was nervous about since the last dentist did the same procedure on the other side and did a terrible job resulting in a cracked tooth. They walked me through the types of novaccaine and the nurse that finalized the filling did an excellent job with the bite–I never had to go back and have it adjusted at all. Dr. Atherly is low keyed, down to earth and has comfortable style. The office staff is friendly and patient, I had to change my appointment a few times to accommodate my work schedule and they were very helpful and always pleasant to talk to.< /review>

I have been a patient of Pebble Beach Dental for over ten years. The practice has been excellent under both Dr. Newhouse (now retired) and  Dr. Atherly. The staff is professional and friendly. They use the latest technology and are very meticulous.  After following their advice about my daily tooth care, I have only needed routine cleaning for several years now. They offer an unbeatable dental plan that even reduced cleaning costs substantially. They earned my highest recommendation ever.</review>

The whole staff is very warm and very easy to deal with.   They are very personable and explain everything being done to help put you at ease. Dr. Atherly is very gentle as a dentist and is very good at what he does and is also very personable as well. This helps to make the whole experience pleasant to deal with, especially if you are someone like myself who doesn't particularly enjoy going to the dentist to begin with. I have been going to Dr. Atherly's for years and have only great things to say and would highly recommend their services. I look forward to continuing my relationship with this fine dental office and all the nice people involved.
sincerely,  Tim Spencer</text>

<review>I've been going here since I was a kid, so I guess I have nothing to compare it to, but I don't have any complaints. They do floss me which hurts if I don't floss myself, so shame on them!<//review><user>108604402024158815894<//user>< gmapID>

The Pebble Beach Dental team has been friendly, caring and proactive in helping me improve my teeth. They've gone out of their way to help. I appreciated that Dr. Atherly does not push any aggressive treatment that may not be necessary. He opted to save one of my teeth for much less money instead of doing the root canal that another dentist insisted was my only option. Their Care plan has also been great and affordable for keeping my teeth regularly maintenanced.</text>

<review>The best place for dental care! Dr Atherly and his stellar staff are all very good at what they do. My family and I love coming here to get our teeth cleaned and check up twice a year. It is a dental practice for the whole family and they really do care about you.<//review>< pics>

<text>My family and I have been seeing Dr. Atherly for a few years now. He takes great care of us and makes us feel comfortable even with yucky dental procedures needed. The office staff is always friendly and proffessional. My favorite hygenist is Melissa. She is friendly, kind and very thorough cleaning my teeth. They all put in extra effort to accommodate my daughter who needs extra patience and care. I truly appreciate each of them for all they do for my family and I. They are an amazing team!< /text><Gmap_id>0x809ade190deb7191:0x4dcfa62932b8cc2f</Gmap_id><rate>5< /rate><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

By far, the BEST Subway I have ever been to! The young, beautiful women working made my experience that much more. They have the freshest bread, veggies, meats... the sandwich I had, i won't waste my time, or money at any other Subway. Best sandwich ever. *plus the manager despite being tired, and still doing an amazing job at taking care of everyone; remembered my order and genuinely cared about my day. She is a warm hearted woman who makes the difference. Thank you for your hard work, smile, and the wonderful cold cut combo!

I will most definitely be back!
Happy holidays,

I usually don’t give a one star to any store but the other night going there I had a bad experience with the two new girls working there and the sandwich they made me didn’t taste good at all, I had stomach cramps after eating the sandwich. The two girls, that work that night was also rude to me.</Review>

<Review>I have never had someone get so angry at me for having to correct an error THEY made. Will not be coming here again.
As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a nasty look from the woman behind the counter, doing her job horribly.
Horrible people working at a mediocre place.<//Review>< Pictures>

Every time I come here they don't have broccoli cheddar soup and they say they had it yesterday and it didn't sell. If the place is open 24/7 they should have all the products available all the time.<//review>

It was my first time there. They have some amazing stylist. All the right precautions are taken, mask, social distancing, bring your own water, and no blow drying cause of Covid-19. I absolutely loved it. My stylist Gracie, did a balayage.<//Text>

<text>Found Shear Vanity on Yelp. Made an appointment on Sunday despite the salon being closed on sunday and monday I got a response when I emailed them. I got a call from Esther on the day I wanted to go in and told I'd be good to come in.
I went in for a cut. I went from mid back length hair to just above my shoulders and I love it!!!
Jessica shampooed and conditioned before doing most of the cut and Esther gave it some texture before Jessica finished with the style I had asked for. She knew what to do to get my curly hair to cooperate and it came out great!
The salon is a pretty big size and it's open, clean, and welcoming as was the receptionist at the front.
I felt pampered and I liked the vibe!!
I'm definitely going to go back as I would like to maintain this short length for a while and I'll definitely need to get it trimmed from time to time.
The price is also pretty good, I was expecting a lot more considering I have a lot of hair and I had asked to get it styled as I sat down on the chair instead of mentioning it when I first emailed them.</text>< Date>

Went here for the first time yesterday for a hair cut and it was hands down the best salon experience I’ve had. Jessica cut my hair EXACTLY how I wanted it, she was so sweet and easy to talk to. Everyone else was also so warm welcoming. Price was great too. So glad I found my new hair spot and hair lady!< /Review>

This is just based off the run around they gave me over the phone. I was asking about orices and who specializes in what services, ssked me to keave my ohone number and they would give me a call vack, never did, waited for 2 days, called back and was told the stylist i would need was not working that day, was given their number, then stylist, who was super nice, informs me she doesnt do that service, and was tokd to call the salin so they can give me the info on the stylist who does. Ummmmm, i thought they had already. Gave up, was really hoping to get my hair done by them, their client pictures look amazing :(</review>

First time here after years of searching for a salon that can manage my stubborn curly hair and I believe I've found the right spot! The salon is located right behind main street Firestone which is great for parking. As for the salon itself, it has a modern look with lovely big windows. Not too girly for the gentlemen. I got my haircut from Amber who is a charming girl and she did an AWESOME job. Might just give me the courage to explore new hairstyles. But nonetheless everyone should come here! Great people, and decent prices. Can't complain :)< /Text>

Unfortunately I had to stop coming here after repeated inconsistent appointment times with my stylist. Would have an appt at 8, would not get seen until 9:30/10. One time a
I had an appt at 11am, didn’t get seen until about 1pm. Too much of my time was wasted. I go somewhere else now because of this.<//Review>

< review>
My wedding was in March and I didn't know where to get my hair and makeup done so I was really stressed. A coworker recommended this establishment, I was a bit skeptical at first since I only saw one picture of my friend when she got her makeup done. I also saw some of their instagram pictures. I didn't have an idea of how I wanted my hair and as for my makeup I didn't want to look like someone totally different. The day of, I got to my appointment and they were very nice and welcoming offered refreshments i.e coffee or water. The staff was very attentive and it was a busy Saturday morning. I absolutely LOVED the updo and the makeup. Very elegant and vintage, just exactly what I imagined. I got many compliments from my guests and family. I would definitely refer my friends and family here. To top it all off I wasn't overcharged like other places. I was an extremely satisfied customer. Thank you Sheer Vanity staff for the time and dedication you take to enhance the beauty of women.< /review>

Nency is an artisan with hair. A couple weeks ago, she asked if I wanted to try something different, and away she went. I thought the hair looked dope, but later that night I was an extra in a music video. People kept on coming up to me the whole night, and were just talking about how cool my cut was. The cinematographer, a lot of extras, and the main lighting girl all went on and on... i'm not even exaggerating. At the end of the night, there was this girl that brought to my attention how much detail went into the cut, and pointed out that Nency had made these slight lines right before the comb part where the hair is styled and told me how impressed she was because it just made everything pop!

Seriously, if you want a sick cut. Check her out.</text>

< Review>
Best bike shop in SoCal. I’ve been to many others and have noticed that even when they are busy they take the time to help you and listen to your concerns. They also have great deals, and sell great bikes and parts. They often have to work past their hours to get bikes back to their users and shows good character.
I would 100% recommend this place to anyone and they have it all.
Not a single con. Only pros<//Review>

The best and only place you should use for all your bike needs! The guys at La Habra Cyclery always take good care of me and my bikes. Love this place!</review>

< Review>
These guys are great. I bought a pretty beat up bike from Craigslist, and they helped me fix it up for a very reasonable price. Then, when I went to pick the bike up, they had just closed the store, but they gave me the bike anyway, and asked me to come back at another time when they were open to pay for it. When I came back, they double checked to make sure everything that they'd fixed was working well, and made some adjustments to get me on my way.<//Review>

What an awesome bike shop. I think Dave is the mechanic super cool guy every time I walk in with a question or issue he is always willing to help and answer questions. Same with shop owner and staff (sorry I forget names) are awesome people. Greet you with a smile no matter how busy they are. Good quality and fair prices. Won’t go to any other bike shop.</Review>

Best bike shop in So Cal. Jim the owner is such an awesome guy! This shop will take care of you and treat you like family. He’s been in business for years! I been going to his shop since I was a kid and I’m nearly 40 years old. Great prices and great service!</Text>

I had an older Specialized Mountain Bike but "needed" a new bike. Jim got to work for me and found a top-of-the-line Giant Trance that is perfect and sold my old bike for me. Good People! Thank you Jim!< /Review>

Whoever assembled this bike was on drugs.  Rear derailleur won't stay on top ring, it doesn't stay in align with all the sprockets..  then I discover that the assembler weaved the rear brake cable around the front derailleur cable!  What's next?  You trust things are right at that dollar range..  apparently not at this bike store.  I'm taking it back and giving them a piece of my mind.  Be on guard here, always test ride first.</Review>< pics>

This is a great local bicycle shop and centrally located on Harbor Blvd. in the city of La Habra. Mountain and road bike heaven here. For the streets and terrain a mountain bike is comfortable.

Purchased  "Giant" here and it's versatile on tough terrain. Road bike also has you "clipped in" with cleats (both mountain & road bike offer unique experiences). COVID hours M-F 9:00 to 16:00.

All servicing of bikes is done on-site and  custom order bikes are offered. La Habra Cyclery has many options available to promote the sale. From road cycles to tri-cycles (you will find it here). Grateful for your help Jim & Dave. Bikes kept us healthy during COVID-19 and freed us from worry and sickness.< /text>

<Text>Do not do business with this shop. First they sold me tubes with the slime for puncture resistance, then the pump they sold me could not pump up the tubes and i had to discard them - no reimbursement from the shop.

Then my wife made the mistake of buying me a gift certificate for $50. I wanted to cash it out because I had just purchased about $200 from this shop within the last 60 days and wasn't planning on any purchases for many months. It is not their policy to do that. Once they have your money, they will make sure you spend every dime in their shop. After I burn this certificate with the remainder I will never shop here again and will advise everybody I come into contact with to not buy there as well.< /Text>< pics>

Unless u have a nice bike and want to talk shop, don't expect any respect in this place. Suppose to fix my dad's breaks. He ended up in the hospital because he fell due to brakes failing. Shop refused to take responsibility. His bike is old and he is a 20+ year customer.< /Review>

< Review>
This is very entertaining for kids. No shade anymore since they cut down the large tree in the middle of the playground. There no tables to have a picnic and no bathrooms to be found. Toddlers have small bladders. This was quite the oversight, despite SF's homeless problem. Overall, fun and functional.< /Review>

Mostly friendly offleashed dogs & dog walkers.  Be careful of construction vehicles in and out of park single pedestrian paved walkway. Some folks disobeying and accessing closed off park areas.  Crowded during mid n late afternoon.< /review>

(Translated by Google) It is a familiar place but it needs restrooms and rather the fencing is tied so that the game ball does not pass and break the windows of the neighbors' houses.

Es un lugar familiar pero le hace falta baños y que se amarre mas bien el alambrado para que no pase la pelota de juego y rompa los vidrios de las casas de los vecinos</Text>

We are so grateful to them. They helped us bring home our fair Lady Farrah.</text>

< Review>
These people at the Norco shelter are amazing! From officer Sandoval (the boss?) to Terry to Ann and Faith, they are all super helpful and friendly.  Last time I called because there was a opposum in middle of the street and I wasn't sure if it was still alive. Officer Sandoval went looking for it, called me to follow up and gave me an update. They truly LOVE animals and do anything to help!< /Review>

<UserId.>115097943460080666005< /UserId.><Text>Wonderful experience with the employee's at the shelter. Stopped by Thursday 3/16 just to look around, you know how that goes. Saw little "Sweetie" and fell in love like everyone else. Found out, everyone interested, had to come back for a lottery on Saturday, 3/18 at 10:45AM to pick a # chip and then 11AM, the drawing. Myself and one other family showed up for drawing, they were from Temecula and my family from Menifee. Some how my number 13 was picked first and Sweetie went home with us. It was fair and the other family was very cordial. I was directed to go to Starlight Vet Clinic a block away to get a special deal since she was an adopted dog, and got her a micro-chip and a rabies shot both at a reduced rate, both done as a walk in. We love Sweetie and she is learning very quickly. Thank you everyone, all the dogs were taken such good care of, and the runs were so nice and clean both times I came and walked up and down looking at all the dogs. Please adopt, don't buy from Pet Stores. Save dog's that need your family.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdb1eTxCljifnLW_epBHCJRrUqykbHr_43pLLM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Rating>

<text>Lady at the front was extremly rude to my wife. We had simply found a dog on the streets, spent three days during and after thankgiving to find this poor dogs owner. Finally had to just give it to Animal control. In which wanted to investigate my wife for doing this ladies job basicly, kept accusing my wife of being the owner... Tax dollars once again waisted on programs that allow criminals to continue to do wrong and upstanding citizens to pay for it.<//text>< Pictures>

Seemed nice. Way down at the end of the road in the hills. Only had three cats though and we were looking for kitties. But they also had dogs and geese and ducks and pigeons. And lots of squirrels running around the property.< /review>

I am so heartbroken that people working at a shelter could be so heartless and nasty toward people. I was in a bad situation and needed somewhere for a dog to go that I could not take back home. I can understand policies and technicalities.  I get that. But to be so blatantly rude to another person who is doing their best to keep an animal safe is just wrong. The woman went as far as to just assume by appearance alone that I was not from Norco.. If you say the words "I dont care.." in ANY context to someone who is trying to do the right thing. You are just a bad person and need to find a new career. NOT in customer service OR "helping" the community. I'm so disappointed with them...<//text>

My sweet 14 year old dog, who had been ill for a while, told me he was 'ready to go' this morning.  After calling around receiving quotes from $468 to $169 - I called Norco Animal Shelter where the fee was only $57.  Officer Sparks and all the staff were so kind and sympathetic to my loss.  Thank you for making a tough day a little less tough.<//review>

<text>The staff are helpful and resourceful.  They wait a week before adopting out the dogs for health check, they spay and neuter all adopted pets which takes about 1-2 days after adopting.  Dogs here are very loveable.  They give all the dogs names instead of numbers.  Most of the dogs here are strays.  Some of them were surrendered by owner.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I wouldn't count on getting your pet here. My girlfriend and I went looking for a dog and fell in love with an alaskan husky, his adoption date was on 12/15/18 so we went in every day to visit him but today, 12/11/18 we found that he wasnt there. Upon asking about why he wasnt there, apparently his adoption date was moved up. Mind you we were going in every day they were open and there was no mention of his date moving up. I even brought up the fact that his adoption date wasnt until this Saturday and the woman behind the desk apparently didnt know anything about it. The staff also rude every time we went, and the dog kennels were always dirty with poop.<//text>

<Review>I recently received the best service at Veronica’s Insurance. I’m a fairly new driver and feared having a high payment for my 2016 vehicle, after the assistance given to me by a rep named Michelle I was able to obtain an affordable payment and leave extremely satisfied. I definitely recommend Veronica’s Insurance and especially the service Michelle provides, she’s one of the companies best assets.<//Review>< Pictures>

For me and I'm sure for my boyfriend as well, we were a bit intimidated about the whole insurance thing but Martha made us feel so at ease and from moment we sat down she did her best to make something happen for us. She definitely hooked it up for us. I'm super grateful ! Thank you Martha for caring about your clients

I'm a returning customer. I purchased a new car. I called around for cheaper auto insurance and to my surprise prices wete steep. I called Martha at Veronica's and she got me an amazing low down and low monthly payment.

Don't waste your time calling around make Veronica's your first and last call. Call ask to speak with Martha..

Happy happy customer<//review>

(Translated by Google) I had the bad luck that arrives and there is nobody the people who work there are not the girls or Mrs. Martita Francisco and the girl Nobody Ukraine are now all new and there was a lady who is also called Marta and she treated me very bad grocera I am charged more in my payment for a day of delay and I told him I was never charged like that for a day and he answered me good now and I get paper that says I would pay that and very grocery should not be there because it has nothing of eduacaciion is very grocery scream the customer should bring her out there to bring their people who had before they were better workers to my mind that Marta Janeth should get out of there super grocer just this month I'm there the other month I'm looking for another insurance that aq Veronica is having this class of person is the one who is sitting forward when you ask for the previous people she says she is not gone, where she asked if she could talk to any of the people who worked there until last month I saw them and said but I am here is very rude, very upset with the customers, they have to take it out, cancel my insurance and my whole family will tell you to cancel besides charging 50 dollars more for a day of delay that's why they will lose a client of time just for that reason I'm going for her I do not want to know anything about you

(Original)
Tuve la mala suerte q llegue y no hay nadie los personas q trabajan ahí no están las muchachas ni la señora Martita  Francisco y la muchacha Ucrania nadie ahora son todas nuevas y había una señora q se llama también Marta y me trató muy mal grocera me cobro  más en mi pago por una dia de atraso y le dije nunca me cobraron así por un día y me respondió bueno ahora si y saco  papel q dice que yo pagaría eso y muy grocera no debería estar ahí porque no tiene nada de eduacaciion es muy grocera grita al cliente deben de sacarla  ahí traer a su gente q tenían antes que eran mejores trabajadores para mi parecer esa tal Marta Janeth debería salir de ahí súper grocera solo este mes quedo ahí el otro mes busco otro seguro que le a q Veronica esté teniendo esta clase de persona es la q está sentada adelante cuando preguntas por las personas anteriores ella dice no está se fueron  nose en donde lporque pregunté si podía hablar con alguna de las personas q trabajaron ahí hasta el mes pasado yo los vi a ellos y dijo pero yo estoy acá es muy grocera muy alterada con los clientes verónica ins tienen q sacarla cancelar mi seguro y toda mi familia le diré q cancelen aparte de cobrar 50 dólares mas por un día de atraso por eso perderán a una clienta de tiempo solo por eso me voy por ella no quiero saber nada de ustedes<//Review>

Super hefty portions. Fries are huge and perfect to share. Your classic charbroiled burger. Great customer service and super clean area.< /text>

Best food ever. It's location is the original hat. Prices are great for the food. I believe there are 9 locations & out of all the locations. I've been to 7 out of 9.

The ones I've been to we're the best. I've tried almost all of the choices. And have not been disappointed yet.

Be certain when ordering fries and onion rings. Order a small one.
Because a small one is for two and a large is for at least 4 to 5 people.

It's certain that you'll have to go back more than once to try out all the food. Because you're not going to be able to try them all out in one day.
Enjoy.<//Review>

The Hat (The Original) is a must if you're visiting Southern California...

The only item's you need to place are;

1. The World Famous Pastrami Dip $10.79.
2. LRG order of (feeds 4 easy) Chili-Cherse Fry $7.29
3. Beverage of your choice. $2.79-$3.29

Follow the above instructions and you will need to take a seat wherever that may be, and sleep for a few moments...👍

!!!EXCELLENT!!!< /review>

First time there. Amazing food. Minus one star cuz I had to ask for condiments instead of being offered when picked up order. Had I not asked, would not have known that they have ranch packets. Come to find out after they also have pickles and pepperoncini as condiments. That's half the experience! But the Cashier service: excellent!< /Text>

Pastrami is tasty, not salty, lots of meat/large portion.  One sandwich is good for 2 people.  Large portions of large fries and onion rings good for 4 people.  Price is reasonable.  Wait time is not that bad depending if it is peak time.  My wife had it for the first time and she loves it.</text>

<Text>This message is for Mr. Don Cook, manager of C & J Food Company/ The Hat.

I was unable to contact you directly and my hope is you will read this at some point.

I was a first time visitor to The Hat in Alhambra and had a terrible experience with the service there.

The host/ cashier was a Hispanic man who was extremely rude. A simple question about the sizes of the fries seemed to annoy him and he put forth an air of being terribly inconvenienced by having to even speak to me. This person has zero people skills or patience for basic interaction.

I felt rushed along and treated very poorly. Please pay closer attention to the attitude of the people you hire. If you have to deal with the general public you must possess more courtesy and patience. I was very polite and should not have been treated like an inconvenience. It wasn't even that busy when I was there. Literally one person ahead of me and no one else showed up until several minutes after my order.

This person needs to be taught some manners.< /Text>< Rate>

<Review>Pastrami-centric joint serving up some great pastrami fries. They're currently operating during coronavirus both through drive through and for takeout. I would suggest calling ahead to place your order as the drive through line was long. They had our food ready in ~15 min. There was a minor issue when we called in the order; the first time, the person on the other side didn't hear us and the second time the call didn't go through. Third times a charm though, so luckily we were able to indulge.

This isn't on the menu, but if you want to have a lunch that serves 3-4 people, you can order the wet fries (the gravy it comes with is so creamy and heavy) with pastrami and cheese on top (extra for both items). The pastrami is thinly sliced and they do not skimp. They did a good job of mixing the things so that even the fries on the bottom had a mix of gravy and pastrami in there. The fries are standard cut and we're piping hot. We went into a minor food coma afterwards

It's super clean inside. They do take credit cards. Service is quick and efficient. Overall it's a good spot to partake in pastrami and treat yourself should you ever find yourself around the Brea Mall.< /Review>< Pictures>

Always one of the BEST pastramis. Onion ring sweet, juice but crispy & crunchy

The Chili Cheese fries are a must.  Bring friends, servings are quite generous.< /review>

Ps. I personally go only for the Chilli pastrami fries 🍟.   (Wish half the fries amount were given, I don't like throwing food out) last but not least 2 of us eat from 1 order and have food left over.<//review>< user_name>

Simply delicious. Double dip with extra cheese is how I like it 😋 I do NOT recommend the chilli cheese fries tho 😝 They are disgusting. Go with plain fries!< /Review>

The Hat has lost its luster. My Pastrami dip was cold, and poorly dressed. Bread was soggy, and the added cheddar was more like crumble.  Fries also soggy. Overall not much better than a bad greasy spoon. There are plenty of other classic burger stand in the area that are better.<//Review>

Major price increase.  Pastrami fries and drink....$18.
Not friendly. As if I was doing them a favor. Try Fadphos at Garfield and Huntington Dr in S. Pasadena<//text>

<review>I am very disappointed, this was my first time here and LAST. We ordered 1 double cheeseburger, 1 cheeseburger, 1 Jr burger, 2 small fries, and 2 drinks. The quality of the burger and TASTE was honestly worst than dissatisfying (There was no flavor in the burger). My local burger shop is WAYYYY Better than The Hat. The burgers were not seasoned and the bun was stiffer than any other burger I’ve had. The FRIES....they were under seasoned which was a disappointment. If you’re known for pastrami you could at least make some decent burgers..This was a WASTE OF MONEY to be honest (you know that feeling that you wished you should have just gone to your regular burger spot-Well that’s how I feel) The drive was not worth it. We were craving burgers and this was not what we were expecting...</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

The food is really good and they give you a lot. Everything is delicious and fresh. Love to come here at night. Especially in the summer after it cools down in the evening.

The double dip pastrami here is off the hook. I watched the line cook pour a ladel of au jus sauce onto the bread before put the dipped pastrami into the sandwich. Wettest drippiest double dip I've ever eaten. Wow!</Text>

The food is delicious and you get WAY to much. And the price matches the amount of food. Spent $19.37 for a pastrami, fries and drink. At least with the amount of food, I'll have two meals which makes the price point s little more bearable.< /text>

<text>Had the Pastrami $11.00 but it's huge enough for two people. Would love some chill cheese fries but they only make one size. Way to much for one person and why they don't make a smaller order is unclear.<//text>< pictures>

< Review>
Well overall a good Pastrami it didn't live up to my anticipation from the memory of the place when I used to live in LA. The bun was just ok leaning towards a mass produced commercial item. The Pastrami was good but the meat seemed a little dry. Maybe I'm just getting a little too picky as I get older.</Review>

<user_name>Anthony Padilla<//user_name><Text>Still one of the best pastrami spots around. Double dipped with a bunch of pickle spears is the way to go!

I have been going to the hat since the late 60's.    Love all their food but the pastrami is my favorite.    Sliced thin for more flavor and lots of it. I also love their roast beef sandwich with gravy burgers are fantastic my favorite place ever</Text>

Fast service and I definitely underestimated the portions.  I would have been solid with a delicious pastrami burger, but felt obligated to get some chili cheese fries.  Only thing was that there was another two pounds of fries. They were delicious though.  Getting that all in Lyft to take have to hotel was difficult, but oh so worth it.  Definitely what I needed after not eating all day.< /Text>< pics>

<text>This is based on safety.  I watch what businesses are doing to keep everyone safe.
Not happy that they are careless. Seems like everyone was being safe but where they fail is the interaction with public and payment. The order taker is also the cashier. So far so good as long as he does not touch anything else. Once Payment transaction is done, no wash of hands nor change of gloves. He write the ticket  then slides it down. It is contaminated.  Then at one point, the handles pull the ticket and cross contaminate everything. Same cashier tries to help by refilling drinks. They use a different cup and pour it to the customer's cup. Is that still safe considering virus is airborne?  Also cashier never changed his gloves when doing this. I am aware many places are careless and I will not go back at this time. Can not take a chance on place that do not realize what they are doing. Cashiers should either have a no touch policy or do no do anything else.</text><Resp>None</Resp><username>C Wong<//username>< gmap_id>

Pastrami burger, definitely has pastrami on it and some of the best tasting I've ever had the pleasure of eating.

Outdoor seating is perfect for southern California weather. Enjoyed it on a Saturday in late January on our way to Disneyland.<//review>

Great pastrami! It was delicious and had this nice crust on the outside, loved the texture of it! Chili cheese fries are yummy! May not look it but they are lol. Great midnight munchy snack lol. Also huge servings! This is also the 1st hat location, makes sense why there isn't any indoor seating. Also, the security guy on duty was very nice and friendly!</text>

I'm sure the pastrami sandwich at this location is pretty delicious. I tried to order a pastrami sandwich, chili cheese fries, and a soda. It came out to like $25 and some change. I have no idea why an order of chili cheese fries is $10 and some change. The chili cheese fries are not that great and who the hell eats that much food in one sitting. Sorry to say but this price is absolutely ridiculous. If the chili cheese fries were actually that great it still wouldn't be worth $10 plus some change for an order of chili cheese fries.</review>

<review>Great consistent quality and service. I've never gotten a wrong order here nor have they ever forgotten anything.
Their chili is great. I love getting chili cheese fries with pastrami on top. Their steak sandwiches are good, meat is tender, and come with a pickle (excellent pickle!). The burgers are great and larger than average.
Their fries are always great.  Not too crispy and fluffy on the inside. A small fry order is about 1/3 of their paper bags full, it's a pretty generous amount. Enough for 2-4 people, depending on how hungry you are.</review>< pics>

Saw this on California throught my lense and decided to come and enjoy the original. This one closer to me. Came here and tried the roast beef with potato salad and it was delicious. So many great things to try I will definitely come back for the chili cheese fries and a pastrami sandwich. Can't say enough good the taste was amazing and great location as well. There was some seating outside which was great for me as I didn't want to drive back 25 min. They also sell grill cheese sandwiches.</Text>

Great place for a BIG pastrami burger. The portions of the food here is great but the price of some of the items are just too god damn high. The parking lot is big and you won't have trouble finding a spot even if it's super busy but the traffic of this place is horrible between the hours of 3-7:30 pm.</Text>

New review: after 20 years of living in alhambra I discovered I could add pastrami to my chili cheese fries. So happy. So happy.
Old review: Thank you for existing chili cheese fries. I just wish they had put a little more cheese and chilli so I could finish all of my fries.<//Text>

<review>One of the greatest places to eat for sandwiches & chili cheese fries. They have the best barbeque beef sandwich I have ever ate! They also make an amazing large chilli cheese fries!!! The food is really delicious & the service is fast! It can get a little busy around lunch and dinner times but it's still worth the short wait! Plenty of empty parking spots as well!!!</review>< rate>

I can't remember a time when The Hat wasn't a local favorite.

The food is excellent. All of it. Personally, the best is their chili-cheese fries.

I'm not exaggerating when I say I gained at LEAST 15 lbs in my mid 20's eating WAAAAAY too much chili-cheese fries with pastrami.

The Hat's Pastrami are the standard for all other Pastrami places.

Parking's just okay. Traffic in the area is terrible. But the food is worth it. It's been around for almost 70 years for a reason.<//Text>

This place is awsome! The chili is great. Chili cheese tamale, chili cheese fries w/ pastrami...anything with chili is great. The portions are pretty hefty so you get your money's worth. It's a small walk up to order kinda shack, so no drive thru. This is my 3rd visit and I still haven't tried everything but so far I've had the chili cheese fries, chili tamale and the chili cheese dog. I will be back for a 4th visit to try their burger.<//Review>

SERVICE:  I was the only customer and the person who took my order (an older man who appeared to be the manager) was not friendly at all.  However, the food was served fast and the young man who handed me my food was friendly.
PRICES:  I ordered a regular pastrami sandwich (their specialty), small fries and a medium drink.  I paid $18.36 - WOW.  I found this to be overpriced for a sandwich meal at an old walk-up fast food joint (with no indoor seating) in Alhambra.
FOOD:  The food was served hot and freshly prepared.  The sandwich was standard in size (on a standard roll), but overflowing in pastrami.  It was A LOT of pastrami. The pastrami itself was good and juicy, but nothing special.  The small/medium fries were actually extra large fries (I was given a paper lunch bag half full of fries).  The fries were thick and good, but also A LOT.  The drink (horchata) was too sugary.  I had to water down the horchata to drink it.
SUMMARY: This is an OKAY place for pastrami, but definitely not a place I would crave or make an effort to return to, especially not at those prices.</Review>

Absolutely love this place! It has an establish history of being around for more than 40 years and it is a very cute family establishment. The meals are large and cost of them is cheap! You are definitely getting more than what you pay for. It is also actually very delicious! Not healthy though but it is a guilty pleasure type of meal :). Serves burgers and hot dogs with fires. Chili can be added!< /text>

Always a great place to try the food just don't go late at night as your food gets cold. Still would like to go during the afternoon and enjoy the  cheeseburger hamburgers they have to offer only one request if they could grill and cook the tomato for me and season it a little that would be nice. You should try it... when I'm at home and I make homemade hamburgers I always grill and season my tomatoes with lettuces its delicious just thought</Review>

I have been here several times. The prices seem quite high given that you're essentially ordering a sandwich. I paid about $25 for two sandwiches and fries. But when you open the sandwiches, you'll find a GENEROUS portion. I ordered two pastrami dip sandwiches. And they did NOT skimp on the pastrami! So much pastrami!

The sandwich was pretty salty, however. And the fries portion was enormous! I ordered a small and it looked like they gave me enough for a party of 6. I really tried to eat as much as I could but only could eat about half of them. You definitely get what you pay for here. But I would recommend drinking tons of fluids (water, preferably) as the sodium content here is probably through the roof.<//review>

< Review>
The food here is decent tasting good but nothing extraordinary. What IS extraordinary are the portions. WOW! I've never eaten at The Hat so I walked up and ordered like I normally do at any burger joint. I ordered a pastrami dip for me, one for my husband, a cheeseburger for each of my two kids, an order of fries, an order of onion rings for my husband and chili cheese fries for me. They don't have meal "combos" so I figured I'd make up my own. BIG mistake lol. My hubby and I were hard pressed to finish HALF of one pastrami, much less a full one. We all picked from the chili cheese fries and still had at least half to bring home with us. We each had one or two onion rings just to taste them and sampled a fry or two as well. We ended up overstuffed and still had about 2/3 of our meal left over. Like I said, the food is typical L.A. fast food, tasty but nothing life changing but come hungry and bring someone to share with because ONE item off this menu is enough to fill you up plus have tasty leftover. FYI its is a bit pricey for fast food (all this plus four large drinks set us back $62) but keep in mind that you are paying for 3 or 4 times the normal burger joint servings. It's the perfect spot to come with a group, order a couple of items and share.</Review>

<review>I requested chicken with my chili cheese fries and manager at night refused my request and was very rude. Never again... I rather go to  Pepe's any request on your order they answer with a smile. Excellent staff committed to excellent customer service.

<Review>When I think West Coast pastrami, I think The Hat. The price is higher than a chain, but the portion sizes are much bigger and the food is delicious. I've only ever gotten the Pastrami Dip (pastrami on hero roll, nothing to dip in) and fries, but that's enough to keep coming back. Last I was there I saw them making chili-cheese fries and they looked so good that I may need to get some (though they look like they could feed 6 people)</Review>< pictures>

< review>
Their chili cheese fries are DELICIOUS (with a huge portion). You will definitely want to share these with a friend (or more then one friend if ordering other food as well). Personally, I wasn't in love with their potato salad (but I'm picky). Their french dip roast beef sandwich is amazing as well. Be prepared, it's an eat outdoor only type of place - but it's also a quick lunch if you are looking for a delicious option in the area.</review>

Best, fattest pastrami sandwich and real onion rings to die for, a huge order! Only outside seating here, roof covers seating area, would be okay in light rain and shaded from sun.< /Text>

<Text>Still the go to place in SGV for hot pastrami after all these decades. Still no public toilets after all these decades. Same ok walk up sidewalk window. Seating area. Hasn't changed much in the 30 years since I went to high school. Try to stop by when I'm in So.Cal. Merging into traffic when leaving is still an adventure.<//Text>< pics>

Pastrami sandwich is good and the fries are fresh. A little pricey and the order taker ignored me and waited on other people behind me. It took a long time to get my food because they work on phone orders before serving people at the counter. Worth giving a try but don't expect good service.<//review>

<review>The Hat is a San Gabriel Valley legend. I only really go there for the pastrami and chili fries, but the rest of the menu is good too. If you aren't watching your calories, order the pastrami fries (which are off menu). Outdoor seating only at this location.</review></record>

I enjoy the wet fries. That's a meal in itself. You can order the gravy on the side so that you can enjoy those fries later. Pastrami sandwich is awesome; better than any sandwich I have ever had.</Review>

10 dollars for a beef sandwhich? I'd understand if it was stuffed. But just some sliced beef and some old tasting bread. Even the pastrami sandwich isn't worth the $10. It had a little bit more meat but still not worth it.< /Text>

The Hat does it old school. The pastrami sandwich is great. Sometimes I get the bowl of chili, with shredded cheese and onions. Fries and onion rings are good and you get a lot.<//Text>

Has been good for me since 1971. They stay behind the curve when it comes to raising prices. Good Pastrami, best short-order.</review>

<Review>Great pastrami sandwich.  Try the pastrami chilli cheese fries.  Expensive but tasty.  Two down side to this place is, one, no indoor seating.  Not a great place to eat when the weather is bad.  Two, sides are too big for one person.  Hate to waste food  but a burger with out fries doesn't seem right.< /Review>< response>

Been to a lot of "the hat" and found that this one gave me a smaller portion when ordering my chili cheese fries.  Love the pastrami sandwiches and pastrami fries and easy to share a plate when you want to bring a friend.< /text>

This is the original The Hat. Known for their famous pastrami sandwich. The sandwich is to die for. Parking is great. I recommend coming with a friend and ordering a large chili cheese fries to share and having each a pastrami sandwich. That is heavan.</review>

Same great taste but smaller portions and higher prices. Two drinks, chili fries and two pastramies for over $30...ouch guys. I guess I can only visit after I get my tax return guys. 😭<//Text>

The Hat has the best pastrami and chili-cheese fries ever. Sure they're super greasy, but its exactly why I love it.

My suggestion is that on any day, hot or cold, a nice pastrami will hit the spot.< /Text>

<Text>The Hat has the best chili in town. Get the chili fries with pickles and tomatoes and you'll be in heaven. Or try the chili fries with pastrami. Their burgers are good and their pastrami dip is the best in town. I have been going here since I moved out to Los Angeles and some times you just crave The Hat. Also, if you are an onion ring aficionado you will appreciate their's, they are crunchy and perfectly browned. I really haven't gotten anything I dislike here.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<name>BRUCE HURT<//name><text>I have been eating at the Hat since 1988 and have always loved it. Recently one opened in Murrieta Ca. And I must say the pastrami was terrible. I was so disappointed that I vowed to never go there again. I will only go to the ones closer to LA. Still a fan but not in Murrieta which by the way is where I live.<//text><rating>1<//rating><Gmap_id>0x80c2c5378d99052d:0xd9cb1762718872c0< /Gmap_id>< Date>

This location is okay, apparently I need to try the others. My bbq beef was barely saucy and not well put together. The burger was good and gravy fries were tasty but mostly soggy.<//review>

I have been going to the Hat since 1958 and must say that they have the best pastrami sandwiches I have ever had. And I have tried many all over the US. Every time I'm in the San Gabriel valley I make it a,point to get off and head to the Hat. 👍❤❤❤</Review>

Yummy burgers and pastrami sandwiches.  Beware that the "pastrami dip" doesn't come with au jus to dip your sandwich,  it comes pre-dipped.  You gotta ask for it on the side. Small fries means massive bag full of fries, enjoy!< /review>

Even though the prices are raised once in a while(ingredient prices rise) they maintain quality and I really appreciate that!< /Review>

The pastrami is mediocre at best and not something that I would order again. Everything is pretty much mediocre to me, even the fries, which should at least be decent. But hey, everyone's tastes are different. I just have learned to go beyond reputation and care more about the quality of the food I am spending towards.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Garfield and Valley.  Alhambra has the original Hat.  Seating is limited to covered patio seating only and it's walk up ordering only as well.  You're exposed to the elements but it's Cali so...no worries.<//Text>

<Name>Brian Wu<//Name><rate>5</rate><date>1424472681846< /date><review>i thought the pastrami was average. but like nancy t says CHILI CHEESE FRIES are the bomb. huge portions, lots of chili. they make the fries just the way i like them, crispy and thick. (that almost sounds wrong). but it's so good. i actually am overdue for a return visit. i can't speak for anything else but now that i'm writing it i am craving fries like none other...<//review>< user>

I have been in the SGV for almost 10 years now and up until this year, had never tried The Hat. Boy that was a mistake. I LOVE IT. The pastrami sandwiches are HUGE and brimming with yummy pickles and mustard (the only way a sandwich should be in my opinion). The most recent time that I went, I got a pastrami sandwich and chili cheese fries to share with a friend. I should have known better than to assume that this was enough food to satisfy two people. It was more like a platter for 3-4. They put the chili cheese fries on top of a 4-compartment cup holder and it has a GENEROUS scoop of chili and cheese on top of the fries. I think I took 3 bites after finishing my half of the sandwich and called it quits. I need to go back and try to tame that beast one more time but this time, I'll bring more back up! >:]</text>

< Review>
Prices slowly going up. Used to be 5 plus a sandwich. Pastrami fries still a monstrosity but something to share with a bunch of people. I prefer the pastrami here over Phillippe's beef.<//Review>

The Hat, I tip my hat to thee!

If you need fries in caveman proportions, then look no further.  For The Hat, is where it's at!

The OG location that started it all, The Hat in Alhambra is an old school food stand, complete with walk-up windows for ordering & pick up, along with a covered patio dining area.  For my inaugural visit, I pondered whether to order their famous pastrami dip or go with their wet fries.  I've read how their servings of fries are quite generous, and being how I try not to eat bread, I thought an order of loaded wet fries was that particular day's calling.

Wet fries w/ added pastrami, tomatoes, pickles & mustard-
Holy crap!  It looks like a food challenge!  I thought the chatter about portions were simply hyperbole, like a tall tale being altered with exaggerations until the details became comical.  But, alas, I wasn't prepared for what lied before me.  I watched my order prepared right before my very eyes.  From thick fries fresh from the fryer, to the slathering of savory brown gravy, the addition of tender, juicy pastrami, to the addition of a pound of dill pickle slices & tomatoes, to the cherry on top being a delicious dollop of mustard, I saw the assemblage of this calorie-busting behemoth from birth to readiness graduation.  The customers after me marveled at the huge portions of my loaded wet fries being prepared, which, like a proud parent, I boasted "Yeah, that's mine."

After laying claim to a table, I dug into my gargantuan meal.  Each bite, wondrous & delightful.  The fries had the perfect thickness to handle the weight of all that smothered them.  The gravy salty & creamy.  The pastrami wonderfully fatty.  The amount of pickles seemed almost ridiculous.  After 5 minutes of going at it, the loaded wet fries seemed like I hardly put a dent in them.  They mocked me, saying "Is that the best you got, bub?"  I did my best to devour the most I could, knowing I'd have to take this monstrosity home to await it's final fate later on for dinner.

Besides the usual condiments, all you can grab whole chili peppers are a must if you're a heat lover.  They're a perfect compliment to the copious amounts of food at The Hat.

Service was good.  Ordering at the window was quick, and I didn't wait long for my fries to be ready.  Ample tables to dine at, with parking in a private lot.  The Hat is conveniently located minutes north of the 10 freeway at the intersection of Valley & Garfield.

Hunger need not show it's ugly head here.  The Hat serves ginormous amounts of food quickly for the famished masses.  I managed to finish my loaded wet fries after 2 meals.  This coming from a guy with a healthy appetite.  I'd imagine some might go a whole day to accomplish that.  Of course, sharing would be a good idea, but I'm not into that.  I want this baby all to myself.  My first visit here, and I see why The Hat is a beloved SGV institution.  If I'm in the area again, and I don't care about calories & BMI, then I'm definitely dropping by for another go at The Hat.

Highly recommend!

So I heard from people and friends I must try this place out so I did and decided to come to this location. It reminded me so much of Tommys Burgers because its at the corner of both busy mainstreets. So the menu of this place didnt surprise me as much as I thought it would but for its price its cheap. So I decided to order the BBQ Beef Pastrami here and a side of onion rings. The moment you bit the Pastrami Beef BBQ sandwich all I tasted was the BBQ. It felt like there was no meat here :/ and the sauce its self has overwhelmed the beef by 90%. But other than that the onion rings did not dissapoint me they were worth buying it cost $4 something and were given alot in the bag. Other than that this place was a good experience next time Ill just order the regular pastrami sandwich instead.< /text>

< Review>
My little Brother Steve (RIP Steve)  and I got a pastrami every time we went to the Theatre across the st, I think The Garfield. They were on a French roll , piled high, then drenched in gravy, cost 65 CENTS. The pool at Granada Park was 20 cents; we earned $ 2 to cut lawns. Best sandwhich in my 71 years. That was 1951 / 52, moved from Alhambra in 1961, boo hoo. My friend ( Butch Rozelle ) , pushed me off the wall around the Castle ( where Phil Spector killed Lana Clarkson years later ) I was semi-conscious for awhile; awoke 3 days later to find the Rozelle's had left town....

Seems more greasy than the others. Outside seating only.. it's covered, but in the heat of the late afternoon/ evening and with the angle of the sun it's unpleasant and only has a few seats in the shade then.. No restroom or highchairs.<//Text>

they're nice, friendly, they're not sloppy with your food, chili cheese fries are popular and one of the best I've ever had and for what they charge for it, you're getting alot for your money.<//Review>

I used to come here when they didn't have giant chili cheese fries with tomatoes, pickles, lettuce, onions and PASTRAMI on top. I used to have to ask them to make a special order like that and they used to pile the pastrami high. Now they use a baby cup to measure the amount of pastrami. This is still the item to order at THE HAT. Make sure you share this one, cause it's damn big!<//Review>
