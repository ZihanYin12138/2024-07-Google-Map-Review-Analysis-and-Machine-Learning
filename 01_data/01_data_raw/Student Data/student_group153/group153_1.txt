<text>Just wanted to say thank you 😊 Chelsea(took my order) super friendly and helpful, even brought our pizza out to us. Pizza is delicious hot and fresh. This is by far the best pizza and service I've had in a long time and I have to get this shout out to the crew at Pizza Hut on Fowler/Herndon, Clovis 9:00 pm. Thanks again!<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPz1gkxsm8ElQUHBD5OXnG9z_ft7iWMczdewaN8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><rating>5< /rating></record>

So to some people its not a big deal but i order the big box and it comes with the 2 rectangle pizzas well apparently they were out of the retangle pizzas but failed to even mention it while im on the phone placing a order. Or to even call me back and tell me. I like those pizzas for the 4 corner pieces which are my favorite thats why i get that deal. But i find it dissatisfying that i decided to come here to help the economy in the time of need right now and spent 35 dollars on something i wanted and which I didn't get. Def wont be getting anymore of my business i will go to small family pizzas places during this crisis and spend my money on a more reasonable price place. Thank you pizza hut for letting me down on something that would of been so simple to tell me in less than 10 seconds smh.</text>

Went in at 12:30 noon couldn't find anyone there.
Finally flagged down a worker in the freezer.
Ordered a pizone, use to get them before.
Just not that good anymore.
Not worth the trip.
Should have known,since I was the only person there at lunch time.< /text>

I got take-out and really enjoyed it. I got their premium veggie pizza and it was soo filling. The crust was like a buttery biscuit; soft on the inside but perfectly crisp on the outside. They also have the option for butter/garlic around the edge of the crust. As far as price goes I got it half off for $10 something and i would pay that price any day for such a good pizza. It's normally 18.95 off whatever. At that price for a large I'm not ordering every day, but it was delicious. The<//Text>

<Text>I HAD THE WORST EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PIZZA HUT AND THIS IS THE PIZZA HUT THAT I HAVE BEEN ORDERING FROM FOR YEARS.  I ORDERED A PIZZA  ABOUT 20 MIN AFTER ORDERING THE PIZZA I REALIZED I GAVE THEM MY OFFICE PHONE NUMBER.  I CALLED AND CORRECTED THE PHONE NUMBER SO THEY CAN CALL ME IF THEY HAD A PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY HAD THE ADDRESS REGARDLESS. AN HOUR AND A HALF WENT BY OF WAITING I CALLED TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON HE SAID THEY CALLED AND NO ONE ANSWERED. I WAS WAITING WITH MY FAMILY FOR THE PIZZA HOW ARE WE GOING TO JUST AVOID THE CALL....   SO ESSENTIALLY HE  SAID THEY CANCELLED MY ORDER. I ASKED FOR THE MANAGER HIS NAME WAS LEWIS AND HE JUST TOLD ME THEY CANCELLED MY ORDER...   WORST SERVICE EVER</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Review>This store will order what you're looking for if it's not in their store stock. Not only am I paying for a system I wanted for a smaller monthly payment than ANYWHERE else, but I got the pro system for this amazing price. I really APPRECIATE THE PEOPLE & SERVICE THIS STORE PROVIDES.  It's not a corporate chain, so they're able and willing to work with ANYONE. You just have to communicate with them and make your payments. Try this store....YOU'LL LOVE THEM! PERSONABLE STAFF NOT FAKE!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1573235735169, 'text': 'Shelia! Thanks for the amazing review! We certainly do appreciate you and it feels great to know our hard work shows!

I greatly appreciate ur business. especially in these hard times we are going thru ...a small business that still actually cares and ask if we are still employed b fore they ask u for the monthly payment...I'm blessed to still be working..but the people that are not they are also blessed. Rent to own is willing to work with you...<//text>

I have bought nearly everything in my house from here. They always work with us on making sure we find something within our budget. I love that we get the extra month to pay off items. The best part about going here is the family environment. There are always family friendly movies playing and my kids feel right at home. I always recommend them to family and friends.<//Review>

Loved renting from this place Grant is literally AMAZING! Only one issue is with joe so rude... I work in customer service and I never have ever would speak to my customers the way he does... I referred my friends over there and they told me he’s rude to them. Sad to say I’ll never rent from them again because of this rude employee..< /Review>

{'time': 1562018609548, 'text': "Hey David, really sorry you feel this way, you purchased the sofa as is. That being the case we still offered you a full refund if you brought the item back, we also offered to split (our cost) of replacement covers. As we discussed if you review your receipt you will see you were not charged any delivery fee only the cost of the product you purchased. We have gone above and beyond for you but that was not enough, I hope you have a better buying experience elsewhere. Sorry we couldn't meet your expectations, at least as you stated you got a great price on a sofa you love.\n\nAdditional info to address your added concerns. The sofa was cleaned before it was floored, not after the sale. It was floored and offered in a clean as is condition which is the condition you received and purchased it in. At the time of your purchase you were made fully aware that the sofa was previously owned and was being discounted for that reason. We are still happy to refund you the full purchase price to resolve this issue as we have offered from the beginning.\n\nRegarding delivery, you asked for a further discount, I stated sure I will sale it to you for that price, but I will have to charge to deliver the item. I told you that in order to deliver the item for free the price we agreed upon really was the lowest price I could offer."}</response>

Company sucks..bought a couch and it had ciggatte burns on it and now owner wants me to pay half to get it fix ..i bought couch as is ..so shame on me for not checking correctly.but who ever cleaned or vacumm couch before delivering it to me should of been said or opened .and it never was..dont go to them ..owner also lied and said he didnt charge me a deliver fee when he did.50 dollars now he isback tracking his words..beware of rent to own ..do not buy or rent from there..first of all dude.you did charge me deliver fee,cause when i first went in asking about couch u asked me if i had truck or for delivery and i said delivery and you said extra 50 for delivery and as far as recipt u can write or type what ever you want to make it seem like you didnt charge for delivery.And who ever cleaned couch before bringing it to my apartment should called me and said hey David i know u seen and dont know if you seen the ciggatte burns but thought we should mention it to u.that would of been the right thing to do.but u were so worried about making a quick buck thats it.And as far as going half with u on anything thats out of the question..because i was going to furnish my whole housenext month with your stuff but after this no way...u lost a customer that was going to spend thousands of dollars there .cause u were so chip on doing the right thing..and i will tell people about this experience and not to go there ...it may not hurt your feelings or pocket .but it will give second thoughts on going there...and remember i didn'tpay for couch until it was delivered ....so again someone should of said something about burns.cause i know i made a big mistake on my part by not checking couch all the way.it is a learning experience and i will be telling some of my friends to close there accounts there .and they also will pass the word on...<//Text>

My husband and I have been doing business with Rent To Own for several years. We have always been treated very well, unlike other places we used in the past. As a customer, it's our place to keep current with our promise to pay. When there was a problem with anything or we just needed to return an item, everything went well. If I could afford it, I would purchase more. Thanks to the owners and all the staff we very much appreciate them working with us.          Thank you, Clay & Barbara Cook< /Text>

This review is in response to the review by Jasen Anstess, a month ago. My name is Clinton and I'm the general manager of Rent to Own in Visalia. I have searched and haven't found your name in our system but I apologize for any service issues you had with us. We pride ourselves on serving our customers with respect and fairness. I would like to ask for a chance to make up for any short-comings you may have experienced in your previous business with us. Please call and ask for me when you have time and we can get you into anything you're in need of rent-free for a month. Thanks.<//review>

Our washer and dryers carry a 2 year warranty from Whirlpool so service is usually a breeze and painless."}<//Response>< Review>
Ok so I resently bought a dryer here and the belt broke on it in two days. its only me in my household so it wasnt that much clothes. "Half loads" I tried informing them that it happened. They acted like it was my fault. Scam artist.  I will never shop there again..</Review>

<Review>It was an amazing and beautiful playroom. The view as well as the activities in the playroom were enjoyed by my children. It is well worth the investment! I intended to bring my sister's daughter and son the next time I visited this location to enjoy what we did. I'm confident they'll enjoy themselves in this environment. It's a lovely, well-kept setting.<//Review>< Pics>

It’s clean and simple yet entertaining . They play children’s music too and is kept pretty clean. Perfect for a baby or toddler.  Its mostly motor skills like climbing jumping sliding activities< /text></record>

Once the kids get a little older, turn the playroom into a kid hangout and homework space. Dark walls create a relaxing, chill space to work in. That was the reason why I chose to visit this place again even if my son was getting older now. Thank you for finding ways to let other older kids play. It was really fun!< /text>

<text>It was a pleasant experience altogether. They loved all the different toys, slides, and a jumper. My kids had an amazing experience there today. All of the staff were all careful and always keep their eyes to all the kids inside. They really took care of everything. Highly recommended!< /text>< Pics>

My kids love this playroom. We've been here a couple of times. I love seeing the happy faces of my kids. In this playroom, they had the best quality of their time. The reason that they loved this playroom because it was so spacious. They could play as much as they want.  Also, they were learning as well.< /review>

Fantastic indoor playroom for children. A fantastic place to visit with the kids even on a rainy day. Well-supervised, clean and reasonably priced, the playroom has a number of different play areas including a giant ball pit with a pirate ship, a soft play area for toddlers, and rooms with dollhouses, train sets, building blocks, books, etc. Our children had a ball and were very reluctant to leave.<//text>

<text>We visited La La Land with our 23 month old twins and really enjoyed the experience. I'm giving it 5 stars for the price ($12 admission only for the children), friendliness and concern of the staff member, cleanliness, and relevance of activities for my children.

One of our twins was not having a good day (molars coming in, feeling hungry) and she was being cranky. The staff member checked on us a couple times to make sure everything was okay. We had only planned to stay for an hour or two, but I think she was worried we were unhappy about something. Everything was great and our other baby was having a blast and did not want to leave, but it was time to go. We will definitely be returning. Thank you, La La Land.</text>< pictures>

This was my first time at La La Land  for my son's 5th Birthday! I absolutely recommend this playground for your child's celebration not only my son was happy but the kids didn't stop playing for the entire 3 hours we were there. The price was great ,the employees were professional  helpful and great with the kids!!! And the owner is very kind!</Text>

I had a bad experience my only time visiting the place. My son was playing when he climbed a small fence about 3 ft high dividing the games from the play area in the middle of the facility when he landed on the ground he broke his arm. There was no follow up after the incident from the staff or ownership and on top of that when I called to file a incident report the women who answered the phone was rude and careless about what had happened to my son. I even called the owner and she showed no care and didn’t seem concern. There was only one person on staff. There should be more staff on site during business of operations. What a horrible experience with horrible customer service.< /text>

Not a bad place to let the kiddos run around and burn off that sugar! Nice simple layout for hosting a kids party and knowing you don't have to clean up or worry about the aftermath such as is the case of hosting a party at home!< /review>

<Review>I wish I could give zero stars. I used to bring my kids here a couple years ago when we lived in Glendale and loved it. Once we moved right around the corner recently, I thought we'd be coming in all the time. But the only two times I've been since we moved to the area have been absolutely disappointing.

We came on the weekday before Independence Day holiday and were told they were closing early, though it didn't say so anywhere online or at the location. The lady said we could only stay 20 minutes but had to pay full price. My kids (2 and 4) were already crying so I paid and figured we'd be back soon and stay a long time to make up for it. I work full time now, so we finally got a chance to go yesterday. It was crazy hot out, but we walked anyway, thinking it would be all the better once we got inside and played in the AC. We arrived sweating and were turned away because they had a private party. The girl there (never seen her before, but could have been the owner, not sure) turned us away and threatened to call the cops when I started asking about their hours and whether they'd changed policies or owners because I had no idea they were "always closed on weekends" as she said. I told her the brochure I had from the last time I was there didn't say that (though it did have lots of prices crossed out and replaced in sharpie with higher costs, hmmmm). She said we couldn't even wait inside for my husband to pick us up in the car!

My kids were crying, we were all sweaty and upset, but I was simply asking about what had changed about policies, and she was threatening to call the cops?!?? So unnecessary and unprofessional. We were going to do my daughter's birthday there next month and I would have booked it today; I decided right then and there we won't be back again. We'll probably do Giggles and Hugs in Glendale instead, like last time.

Don't waste your time here unless you're prepared to be turned away at the door or kicked out within 20 minutes.

To add to the ordeal, they are now publicly lying, saying they never threatened to call the police when in fact they did so right away -- and more than once. Rude, unprofessional, and outrageous threats = NOT the kind of business I want to take my children to.

EDIT to add: I now realize it was the owner all along, Ripsie, who was so rude and made the outrageous threats to call the police when I asked whether they had any recent changes in hours, policies, or ownership. Wow! Never have I been treated in such a manner, in front of my children no less. There are MANY other indoor playgrounds around here that are much better and treat customers with genuine courtesy and respect. Don't bother with La La Land.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1536609660031, 'text': 'When you walked in Sunday afternoon we nicely informed you that La La Land is closed o the weekends. You were not happy with that and started insisting it doesn’t say that on our brochure. One of our team members explained that we are always closed on Sat and Sun for private events and showed you a copy of the brochure clearly stating the hours of our business. Our website, the front door of the business, our brochures, Yelp and even this very platform, Google clearly states that we are closed on the weekends. You started raising your voice at our employee, used foul language which is not welcomed at a place of business that is for children, and this disturbed and made the event goers of the private party very uncomfortable. You were kindly asked to leave. I understand that you walked in the heat, but this is not a decision we made for you, nor do we condone or tolerate hostile behavior in our business.

<review>I just had my daughters 2nd birthday party here with her bff... so a joint birthday party and it worked out great. The staff were great at keeping the kids entertained with face/hand painting, music and parachute game-very age appropriate. There was also an air hockey game which occupied the older kids. Was a great party package that included utensils, tea&coffee, balloons, pizza, juice, favors and tablecloths, so all we brought in was the sheet cake, water and food.
I would however have liked to have seen a secured door/gate like other playareas to safely let the kids in and out of the area< /review></record></dataset><record>

Really cute. This play area is great for 1yr to 4yr olds. It has a little bit of everything, which is good. The prices are great too! Theres a starbucks near so thats a plus!<//Text>

Minn (the technician) was very professional and resourceful. He first came out for diagnosis and was able to identify the problem. Our refrigerator is an old model and the previous owner did not even have a manual. But Minn was able to find an electronic copy online. While he encountered further problems, he pooled the knowledge of his team to diagnose the issue. Finally, he ordered the replacement part for us and returned to install it. So far, the refrigerator is working great.</Text>

The technician was single minded in his assessment of the problem.  Black particles have been appearing routinely in our washing machine for the past 1-2 months. After spending an hour turning the machine on and off, and turning the water to the washer on and off, the technician insisted repeatedly that the problem was from "the water." He disregarded the fact that we have had our washer for more than 10-15 years, and never replaced the hoses!  He disregarded that the sink faucets right next to the washer ran totally clear water, but he repeatedly insisted the black particles "are from the water."
I don't think Sears makes it clear in the billing policy how customers are charged double. I thought the $139 for diagnosis included the time the technician was here to make a diagnosis.  The technician charged us $280.12 for the visit.  He was unable to come up with a plausible diagnosis, did not replace any parts, and provided no satisfactory solution. Both my wife and I surmised the black particles were from our old hoses, but for some reason the technician totally dismissed our theory. His explanation, "I have seen this before because of dirty water."
I would not recommend Sears home services repair to anyone based on this unsatisfactory encounter.  I am sorry to say that this technician is not good for your reputation.</review>

Sears Appliance Repair Service is NON-EXISTENT! Don't buy anything through Sears...ABSOLUTE WORST CUSTONMER SERVICE EVER!Kenmore water heater covered by 9-yr warranty, heating system failed. Called Sears to have it fixed, scheduled for 5/7. On the day of service, we get a call/notice that truck broke down, now rescheduled to Saturday, 5/9. Repair guy showed up in the morning, replaced part and flushed tank. When he left, it was working, but 2-hrs later water was gushing out of the drain valve, flooding our garage. Luckily the damage could have been much worse hadn't my wife gone into garage and called me. I had to shut off the water to the tank to stop the flow. We immediately called Sears back to get the repair guy back. All they could do was tell me that they sent him a message. After 5-6 calls back to Sears and no response from the repair guy, finally at 4:45PM they said he would be calling us to come back out and fix the valve. No call! Now after 5PM, Sears Repair Ctr is closed...without hot water thru the weekend. First thing Monday, we call Sears Service Ctr again, they state they have no repair person avail until Thursday, 5/14. They will ask to send someone sooner, but no guarantee. There is absolutely no priority given to current jobs that were not fixed properly. The Customer Service reps have absolutely no authority and are USELESS. Now it will be 10+ days without hot water...thanks to Sears!</text>

The A&E technician that provided the washing machine repair had excellent customer service.  He notified me when he was on his way so I did not waste valuable time waiting around all day.  He was thorough and knew his craft.< /Review>

<review>Technician was awesome.  Sears customer service and getting everything set up was horrible.  No confirmation email (3 requests).  Repair was very expensive for a generic catch all repair that they apparently do for all refrigerators (thermostat and timer).  Could not get smaller repair window unless I called late at night or on the day of my repair (sorry to my boss - couldn't give him proper notice of when I'd need time off).  Warranty was offered on hold, but rep refused to discuss it, give me a quote or sell it to me unless I cancelled my appointment that I had waited almost 3 weeks to get.  The terms clearly state the warranty can be used towards a current repair.  Chloe was clueless and rude.  She said I had to cancel my current repair because it had already been assigned to the technician.  This was the only way she'd sell me a warranty.  Wow.  I now know why all their stores are closing.  This is not the Sears of yesteryear.< /review>< pictures>

I rated the service with a deserved 5 stars, however, I would give the booking system 2 stars.  After I scheduled my appointment on line, I received a confirmation message which listed a charge associated with the appointment. I assumed this was a glitch that would be auto-corrected since I had a service contract. However, each successive reminder continued to list there would be a charge.

I called Sears and clarified that I had a contract. The scheduler told me we had to reschedule my original appointment, because I booked it on line, and supposedly if you have a contract you have to call for an appointment.  Even though when I booked on line my appointment WAS associated with my contract number and indicated no charge for the maintenance check appointment. Very frustrating to have to wait several more days for a new appointment, when one was already scheduled and the contract number confirmed.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1525279234348, 'text': 'We are so pleased to hear that you had such a positive experience with our tech.

< review>
January 14 annual maintenance was performed on my 33 yr old refrigerator - that was working PERFECTLY...a real work horse.  After the technician left I noticed it was making a noise different from normal, and constantly running.  I called Sears, and was told I would have to wait for a technician to come and look at it - on January 23.  The next morning I realized it was not the correct temperature in either the freezer or fridge section.  I again called saying I couldn't wait until January 23 - for a problem they had caused.  I was told they had to wait for Dispatch to classify it as an emergency, and I needed to call back at 5pm  to get the status - Really?  I called back, and was told the date was still Jan 23, unless a cancellation came up before then...which was confirmed by a manager.  In the mean time I am loosing all the food in the fridge.  I paid a LOT of money for the maintenance agreement, and this is the service I get for their mistake????< /review>

My Craftsman 3/4 HP garage Door Opener stopped working, so I scheduled a service appt for repair. Given a 8 to 12 noon window, the tech came at 10 a.m. Very professional. Not only explained clearly everything, but also demonstrated too.  I was very satisfied with the interaction.< /text>

Two trucks appeared. One of the drivers never entered the house. Both trucks arrived at 5:50, though the window was 1-5 PM. At about 4 pm one of the repair guys called to say that they'd be late.

The purpose of the call was maintenance. The repairman tried the rinse and spin cycle of the washing machine. and declared it in good working order.

On the dryer, he did an extensive cleanout of the lint trap, and removed an impressive amount of debris. He checked the heat in the dryer and declared it to be in good working order.

The dryer works much better now.< /text>

The problem was the amount of time it took to get the repair completed.   It takes 2 weeks to get an appointment.  They come out, determine the part, and order it.  You have to wait two weeks to get an appointment to install the part.  If that doesn't fix the problem (I don't blame them, lots of logic boards on these new ranges) you schedule another appointment to install the second part.  You're now at 6 weeks.

This might rate a review of maybe 2, possibly 3.  For the installation of the 2nd part the repairmen was scheduled at 5, but he got held up and had to work until 7 and told me that I would have to reschedule.  And even though it was their error I had to wait another 2 weeks!  Having a major appliance down for two months is not acceptable, thus my 1 start review.  But they were very good at telling me when they would be there, gave me lots of reminders that they would be coming so if it weren't for the time element I would give them a 4 or a 5.< /text>< rating>

< Review>
Sears gets NO stars. I've waited over 3 months and my machine still isn't fixed and it seems the warranty is false advertising. Each appointment is 2 weeks apart. The first 2 so called technicians made the washer worse, then the next 3 appointments were cancelled with less than 12 hours in advance and 2 cancelled the same day. Finally a guy came out and figured out the problem in 5 minutes, but had to order a part...that took 2 weeks. Last week it was scheduled to be installed, but the 'technician' called at 4 pm when he was supposed to be here between 8 am and noon to say he needed a second person, and said he'd be here tomorrow. Now Sears is telling me I have to wait until next week. This is a nightmare!!!

Well, the one really nice and efficient technician  (among the many that came and did nothing) came back and fixed the machine - finally after 3 months. He was really great and I appreciate his professionalism amid the chaos that is Sears Repair Service. yay!< /Review>

<review>We were fortunate to be able to use our 20% discount for this visit.
The repairman was fine, I guess. My husband was here to meet him.
There was nothing wrong with the dishwasher, which was our main concern.
The repairman indicated the problem was in the hose under the sink but he was told by his manager not to touch it as it was not his expertise. If he broke anything, they could not be responsible. I understand that. However, what did we pay $100 for? if the repairman really could not do anything. The following day, my husband crawled under the sink, took out his tools and cleaned out the hose himself.
I don't suppose a reimbursement is in order. This repairman has his job to do and a living to make. However, I think Sears should be able to compensate us for our time and wasted social security monies.

<review>The repair was done quickly and efficiently on our washing machine, about 20 minutes, Unfortunatly he arrived 3 hours late, after 5PM, Our scheduled time was between 10AM and 2PM. We called Sears to find out what had happened and they said they would call us back with information, They never did call back! We thought perhaps they were going to call us and reschedule for the following day, but then the repairman showed up and quickly repaired the washing machine. We were pleased to have it repaired, but you really should follow your scheduled hours or at least call us and let us know that you're going to be late!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Sears sent two service men. The first was for the washer and dryer. This guy just checked the ventilation which was clear, wiped off the sensors inside the dryer and was done. Did not do any preventive service, Like blow out the heating area or check the gear area at all.
The second guy was fabulous. He was to service the refrigerator. Mind you I had two service repair men out prior and was told that there was nothing they could do for me and it was just a defect. After this gentleman came out and assessed the problem, he informed me that what should have happened was to have my FRIG REPLACED!!!
Now they have kits to fix the problem. This guy ordered the parts and a week later the parts arrived. the guy came back a week after that to replace the parts. Frig is now fixed and working properly.

Bottom line here is that all servicemen do not know it all. I wish I knew this earlier, I would have had a new Frig.

Second guy was great!!! Great job second guy!!</text>

<time>1480533591564< /time><username>Charlene Dow</username><text>Our carbon monoxide monitor came on Friday, I called Sears repair services and an appointment was scheduled for Saturday morning. The repairmen arrived promptly at the time he quoted.  He cleaned and tested the furnace for carbon monoxide and changed the batteries for us in the monitor as well.  He explained that we had a good service agreement in place and that we should call every 6 months for routine maintenance.  He suggested that we replace the filter and gave me the model number. He waited in his truck while a drove to a nearby home improvement store for the filters.  He wrote the date and replaced it and left the extra one for future maintenance.  He was courteous and put on dust covers at the door to protect our floors from the rain.  Excellent service coupled with friendly and courteous repairment is a "Win Win" visit.</text><Rating>5< /Rating>< gmap_id>

I have a Kenmore Elite Dishwasher purchased in 2013. Thank goodness we have the Protection Agreement because the unit is a complete LEMON! I have had 5 service calls, all for leaking, with the most recent visit on April 8, 2016. The unit is leaking again after a week. I have been told by several service consultants that I am eligible for a new unit under my protection plan, but just talked to an unhelpful consultant with the Protection Agreement Benefits department who said that all 4 service calls need to be within the same year.

This unit has leaked every other week since we have had it. I have just dealt with it and not called in every single time because it takes a minimum of 2 weeks to get a service call scheduled, and then they give you a 4 hour window which always falls either on the time I drop my children off across town, or the time I am picking them up across town (we live in the city and there are no school buses, so I must be available to take them and pick them up).

Another issue that consistently occurs with this unit is that within 5-8 minutes of starting the unit, the unit will completely shut off before the Wash cycle starts. This has happened as long as I've had the unit.

I have been told by a service technician that this Kenmore Elite is one of the worst dishwashers and I will never completely fix the leak issue. It will continue to leak from different areas. He said he would never purchase another Kenmore again and recommended a Bosch brand.

I will continue to call in EVERY leak and issue with this LEMON until they uphold their agreement benefit.<//Review>

<Review>Very expensive service around SF. $90 diagnostic and only then you see the cost of the repair, which is very high. Technician replaced ice maker in about 15 minutes and charged $350 for labor, $90+tax for parts. $450 to have the ice maker repaired on a $1800 fridge is a bit much. Technician also imposed a lot on my personal time by repeatedly and insistently trying to see me more services: insurance plan, fridge coil cleaning, etc. even as I refused to purchase and politely let him understand I was busy. Some of the promises he was making about the insurance plan turned out to be incorrect after reading the fine print (claimed appliance plan would cover furnace cleaning when in fact one needs a maintenance plan, which is separate). Not going to call Sears again. The repair works though.</Review>< date>

It was fine.  But our repairman basically told us that our machine was starting to rust through and that it was going to last much longer and that we should just buy a new one.  He said there really wasn't anything he could do...so...our best option was to buy a new one as this one would probably give up the ghost in about 6 months.  At this we decided that we will just wait until the washer tells us it's done...than to go out an buy a new one right away.

We've had great service in the past...and when we do buy our new washer we'll get the maintenance program again...however, we chose not to renew this time around since what's the point if they can't fix it anyway...</review>

So they first sent me a 3rd party contractor the company was "Peninsula Appliance Repair" in redwood city. That company was the worst. They came out a total of 4 times to fix my dryer and could not fix it. I called sears and complained about them, so they finally sent me a Sears certified technician, and what a difference. They technician was able to fix my dryer in 1 visit.  I wanted to give him a $20 tip but would not accept it.  As for Peninsula Appliance Repair i will not ever allow them into my home. They do not know how to fix dryers. it was 4 visits spread out within 2 months...and still did not fix it. So Sears Service Tec gets 5 stars, and Peninsula Appliance Repair gets -5.....I do not know why sears hires these guys who are probably over charging sears for all these service calls. Sears should investigate Peninsula Appliance Repair</text>< Name>

It took one appointment to book a technician's time who could come in two weeks. The technician came in and after a few minutes of looking at it, he needs a thermistor to replace. I mentioned to him that should he have one in his vehicle. He doesn't have it. How could a common problem like a thermistor replacement be difficult? I'm sure that he can buy one very quickly and then come back; there are local stores and Sears that has the part, but he keeps insisting on ordering it and shipped to my house. It took three business days for the part to arrive and took another two-week appointment to get the washing machine fixed. After confirming that the washing machine is functional, I checked the assembly and there are springs sticking out when it was supposed to be tucked inside. If I could, I would just tuck the spring inside, but it seems that the washing machine would need to be disassembled again just to tuck the spring in. I called for a third appointment and this time, it would take a month for a technician to come in. So it would probably take about two months just to fix a common problem.

The one-year contract agreement indeed works so that I would not be charged extra for his time, but time is money, and having a nonworking washing machine for a month is frustrating.

Next time I need help with an appliance and if the one-year contract agreement expired, I'm not going through with Sears Home Services again. It's not worth the time.</review>

Great technician came out to my house this past Monday and resolved the water filter (defective) and changed the ice maker motor. (No more droning noise from the refrigerator.  Very pleased with how hard the technician worked!  I received a phone call early in the morning telling me what time he would arrive and later in the day advised he was enroute. That being said, the technician  who was supposed to come on Saturday, never called and even though I was home, I never saw him, though he claimed to be at my house at 2:30.  No call from him.  Appreciate Sears getting a repairman here a few days later.< /Review>

I received a Sears call the day before to let me know that between 1-5pm a representative of Sears would BE COMING BY. 15 minutes before arriving (3:00) the representative called to verify what the problem was with my freezer. I let him know every thing in the freezer was frozen, he asked me to remove all the food so he could defrost it. The freezer door was opening up every time I would open the refrigerator door. Would not close all the way.
He was able to fix the problem. I thought he should bring towels when dealing with freezers. He requested a towel for him to kneel own so he would not get wet.
After finishing the job, I asked if he needed my signature and he said no.  I also did not get a receipt, (first time I don't get one). He wanted to know if there were any other issues, I told him about the washer dripping water when doing a large load, he showed me how when there is hair built up I should remove it from the door glass. Also the noise from the dryer was a bad roller. All and all I was pretty pleased with having my fridge back in order. Thank you Sears.</text>

Three years after buying a Kenmore Elite refrigerator, the unit stopped working.  We came home from vacation to find a refrigerator/freezer full of rotting food.  An appliance should last more than 3 years!
We had purchased a Master Protection Plan and called on August 8th.  After 3 service calls and 4 weeks we finally have a working refrigerator.  In addition the tech would not take the broken compressor saying that it was our responsibility to dispose of it.  We were very disappointed with the quality of the refrigerator and the length of time it took to get it back in working order.<//text>

<review>For the third time, The repairman did not fix the problem. The dishwasher continues to leak. The kind of service I have  been getting is not acceptable and waiting weeks for a next appointment is even less acceptable.I am expecting another repair effort tomorrow and have no illusions that the problem will be resolved. I believe it is time for a replacement dish washer.

<review>both repairman were quite nice and very professional. My only complaint was this could have been wrapped up in one visit rather than two had the person who took the initial call passed on the info I gave him. I knew which part had to be replaced after consulting the manual and shared that info with the appointment setter. The first repairman, had he brought the suggested part with him, could have resolved the issue right than and there. Instead we had to wait an additional two weeks.</review>< UserId.>

<text>This visit was just for maintenance of my dryer and washer.  The repairman cleaned out the lint in the dryer and measured the temperature which I thought was good.  However for the washer, all he did was run a short cycle and told me that all he does is make sure the water fills up and drains.  That's not maintenance!< /text>< Pictures>

<review>We have had refrigerator protection for 10 years and this is the worst experience so far. When we called we had someone come out in 2 days. He supposedly fixed the machine but did not leave a card or anything in case it didn't work. We've had people come out for year and always give us their card so that we can follow up. Less than 8 hours later we noticed that the fridge and freezer not cooling at all. I phoned the next morning to see if we could get someone out again. They said 2 weeks from that day and that we were on some emergency list. It's now a week later and I phoned again because this email for comments arrived. They said any new date of service was February 8! Crazy! We've been living out of a cooler, the repair service said we could rent a fridge - but in San Francisco, there aren't any places that will rent out short term rentals. So we buy ice every other day and have had to eat out often. This is super inconvenient for a service we pay a lot of money toward. Then, to top that off we got a call a day after we set up the new appt to extend our service 2 more years, even if we buy a new refrigerator. We've always had good and prompt service and this is the first time we have experienced this. I'm truly disappointed.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Sears Technician arrived about an 1 1/2 hours into the 4 hour window they gave - so that was a plus, didn't have to wait long.

Highly efficient, he got to work right away and fixed my dryer right away. He was done  in about 30 min, very courteous and knowledgable about his craft. He was the same guy who fixed my washer about a year ago and have not had to call him back, even though I purchased the warranty. Only thing is I forgot to ask for his name.

I highly recommend Sears Appliance Repair!!!<//review>

1st appointment was 2 weeks out to repair our dishwasher. When the tech came out he diagnosed the problem right away, the pump, but didn't have the part on his truck. Why wasn't a common part like that issued to him prior to the call?  The part was ordered & arrived within a week, but I had to call to schedule the service call. Sears should have known & flagged the system to alert them the part was delivered & contact me to set up the appointment. The tech was quick to replace the pump & found a problem with the drain hose too. Both techs were very good & informative.</review>

The young man who serviced my washer and dryer was exceptional in every way - very professional, knowledgeable, explained everything he was doing, advised me on how I can best maintain both the washer and dryer.   You can be very proud of this young man and the service he provides and the professionalism with which he provides it.</review>

<Review>The technician Eric was very friendly and knowledgeable about the refrigerator and washer that he repaired. After the repairs both are working like new even though they are 10 years old. The only problem was the lack of communication between Sears, sub contractor and me. Nobody showed up for the first appointment, the second appointment I had a 8 hour window and he showed up 2 hours late. The third appointment Eric showed up on a Saturday which was unscheduled but I'm glad he did. They over work their Tech with too many service calls.<//Review>< pics>

excellent service repair from Sears again.   The technician fixed my problem without too much trouble.   he did huff and puff a bit while doing the work but evidently it was a difficult task.   But my water is now flowing out of the dispenser again and I'm happy.    My only complaint was the wait time for an appointment.  I guess these guys are pretty busy because I had to wait almost two weeks for my repair.< /review>

<Review>Anthony was the best.  His 1st visit he disgnosed the problem and ordered the parts.  When he came back the parts were he waiting for him..He went to work immediately.  Not mess, no fuss and the problems we have been having are gone for the 1st time in years.  He did not just put a bandaid on it, he has actually fixed the problems.</Review>< Pics>

Not ideal. The machine broke within 2 years of purchase, but luckily I had sprung for a 3 year warranty. The customer service system is dysfunctional and needs to be better organized so the customer doesn't have to wait so long. The first scheduled repairman was a no-show. When I called to reschedule they told me it would be another three weeks to reschedule another one. I had to beg them to do the repair in a timely manner because it was for my rental unit and the tenants have a baby. So they agreed to come earlier. At that point things got a bit better. The repairman was very nice and did a good job.<//review>

First repair man showed up, but we never heard him knock. He marked down that he'd been at our place for an hour and a half and couldn't diagnose the problem, even though he'd never been in our house.

Second serviceman arrived and diagnosed the problem (washing machine was making screeching noise), but after his repair, the washing machine now gushes water all over the floor with every wash.

We called to schedule yet another appointment, but the earliest they had was over a week out, so we are gonna have to go to a laundromat while we wait.<//review>

Had three service calls over three week period for a mother board issue on a Whirlpool front load washer. Replaced board didn't fix the problem. Ordered another board when they went to replace it they claimed board was faulty. While on site called there tech support and had the call on speaker, apparently they ordered the wrong board because they gave them the wrong serial number!!! So after three weeks of getting no where and not having a service plan, determined that the cost of the boards they were replacing was more than buying a new washer. Cancelled service so I didn't have to pay for boards that didn't fix the problem! Bought a new washer not from Sears! Would never use Sears repair service again there diagnostic skills are terrible.<//Review>

<text>The worst experience I have ever had with any service person that has come to my home.  I had been given a four hour window between 8-12, this man showed up exactly at 12 . Did " paperwork "  on his computer for 55 minutes. Took pictures of the refrigerator. He looked at the refrigerator, made me sign a disclosure that if he dropped anything on my floor or damaged anything while fixing my fridge he would not be responsible for the damage. He did more "paperwork", was on  his phone looking for a part. I asked him what was wrong with my refrigerator, and how much longer was it going to be, because I had to leave at 3:00, he stopped and reprimanded me for "wasting his time with my questions. This technician was at my house for 2 1/2 hours all he did was "" his paperwork", defrosted a little ice from inside my refrigerator, and reprimanded me several times for wanting to know what was wrong with my fridge. Needless to say my refrigerator is still not fixed after the 2 1/2 hours. The worst customer service ever!!!! The only reason I gave him one star is because he did place the order for the part needed so another technician can repair my 1 1/2 year old Kenmore fridge. After being at my house for 2 1/2 hours, he packed his computer gathered his things and walked out without saying a word. This is such a disgrace for SEARS!!!!!!!!! This man should not be in contact with customers!!!!!!!!!!!!< /text><user_id>108166406580114783784</user_id><name>Lynn S<//name><Time>1475012288962< /Time></record>

<Text>I doubt this will change anything but

I waited 6 weeks for first appointment due to busy schedule
The technician stated she would order the part after she arrived
Waited another 5 weeks for the part and to be put on her schedule
Part was not compatible and was used and did not work
Orderd a part from the factory waited another 6 weeks for the technician
She had a very busy schedule
New part arrived and installed
The TV works now
This process took over  three months with no TV
She apologized
I missed the inauguration,  golden globes, Oscar's and much much more
This was totally unacceptable service
The technician was lovely, efficient and competent with a delightful attitude
The problem was not hers she was clearly over booked
Please send me a letter of apology and a gift card for your very poor service so I know what you actually care about your customer service
I will not be shopping at Sears in the future and definitely not getting your warranty

Regards

Judy sullivan

1st repairman did not adequately investigate the problem and ordered a whole bunch of unnecessary parts. Microwave still functional (door/light issue) so the 2 week wait was not a big deal.
2nd repairwoman replaced said unnecessary parts which naturally did not resolve the problem. During further investigations, the repair woman inadvertently broke the already broken piece such that the microwave was no longer functional. The proper parts were ordered and we are now 2 weeks without a microwave.
3rd repairman comes to fix the microwave and discovered that the replacement part broke during shipping. At this point, my warranty kicks in for a new microwave.
New microwave purchased but it cannot be delivered for another couple of weeks. The holidays pass and we are scheduled for a delivery this past Tuesday. Delivery service calls and says driver is sick so we have to reschedule for the following week. That is a lot of days without a microwave.
On the other hand, the 2nd two repair people were pretty good. The first guy did not help AT ALL.<//Text>

My refrigerator broke and was covered by a protection plan I had purchased from Sears.  I called and had to wait 3-4 days for a service call.  When the technician came, he said the problem was a defrost control device which had to be ordered and delivered via UPS.  I would have to call Sears again after the part arrived to schedule another service visit to have it installed.  He warned me that I might have to wait many days.  I have 3 kids and it's pretty hard to live without a fridge/freezer!  The part arrived after a couple days and I called Sears - they said I'd have to wait 3 weeks for an appointment to get the part installed.  I called several more times to complain and they moved up my appointment by one week.  When the second technician came to install the part, he realized that the problem was NOT the defrost control device, it was the thermostat, and all technicians have extra thermostats in the truck.  So the first guy could have fixed it on the first visit had he made the right diagnosis.  Because of this I had to live for 3 weeks with no fridge/freezer.  This is NOT why we pay for extended warranties.  I am pretty sure that if my appliance was NOT under warranty, Sears would have sent someone to my house much more quickly for a cash visit.  This is not appropriate.  That being said, now my appliance is working, and I did not have to pay for the parts or labor (it was covered under my warranty.)  But 3 weeks is WAY too long to wait.< /text>

The repairman finally came out only to have to order a part then another appointment to install said part. The technician was great but my washing machine is still not working. Another appointment has been set but it will be over 2 months having a broken down washing machine that is under insurance. No guarantee he can fix it when he comes. Most likely will have to order another part and another 3 weeks. The laundromat is getting very expensive.< /review><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

The technician was great but the scheduling and communication to get the appointment and keep track of the repair information was terrible. At first we were given an appointment 2 weeks out, not acceptable as we need our washer daily. They asked for details and I let them know what part needed to be replaced. I was able to make an appointment online for a week out and called to make sure the details for our appointment were transferred. Unfortunately they did not transfer the details, that the washer was covered and that there was a specific part that needed replacement, so the technician showed up without the part and had to order it and come back a few days later. Very poor communication. It almost appears that the scheduling was done farther out because the washer was covered and there would be no additional payment.<//Text>

Repair person left, I started a load of laundry.  First load, no heat.  Good thing there is 90 day guarantee on parts and work.   I called Sears service, and they told me it would be over two weeks before someone could come out. (I had already waited two weeks for the first call).  I asked if there was any way to get faster service, as they did not correctly fix the problem.  They said they would put me on cancelation list.  So far I am still waiting, but a survey from Sears arrive.  Also, they told me that if they found anything else wrong with the drier, it would be another $79 diagnostic fee.  I told them I thought that was unfair, as it meant they mis-diagnosed the problem. originally.  "too bad" was the sense of the response.

Update:  An email from Sears said to call an 800 number immediately if I was not happy with my repair.  I called, gave a detailed explanation of my issue.  The Customer Service rep. told me he was the wrong person to help and transferred me to a another person.  That person collected my info, said they were sending it to the escalation department.  I asked when I could expect to hear from the department, and he told me that I would not hear from them.  It was an internal escalation, so there would be no response to me.   I there a way I can lower my rating from 1 star to 0.5 stars?<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<text>First off, it took us over a month to get a repair person out to our house to replace the seal on our freezer door. Our original repair person that came out several months ago to fix the icemaker told us the freezer door seal was bad and to schedule an appointment. Forgot to call but finally did schedule the repair. Sears kept calling us to "reschedule". Repair man finally shows up, took one look at the door and said nothing was wrong. Stayed at our house for all of 3 minutes. Had to call again to get another repair man to come back out again. Not happy at all. The lack of service is horrible with Sears. Our issue is STILL not resolved after numerous phone calls and wrong parts.< /text>< Pics>

The service was fine, but I had the 1-5PM window, and he showed up at 7:00! I took off from work so I could be available during the window time. Unacceptable to not keep to the schedule or communicate with the customer. I had to call to find out he was running late!</Review>

This is the worst service experience I have ever had.  6 hrs late for the appointment, service tech had an attitude, said he would order the parts  but we never received them. They show the service call as closed and repaired. For 30 days the refrigerator has not worked, now we have spoiling food and they tell me the next service date will be 8 days from my phone call this morning. When I asked to speak with a manager or supervisor, I was told there was no one else to talk to besides the 1-800 person. Again, I would NEVER recommend A&E service. I'm in the process of canceling my service contract now.<//review>

The guy show up on time. We paid $50.00 for the parts. The guy ask us to pay cash or check. He said for the check make it payable to cash. He left without giving us a receipt. We are surprise that we need to pay for the parts we thought its part of the warranty.</Text>

The service  was horrible. The repair man came 1st thing in the morning did not have the part and said he'd be back at 5pm. He did not return until 630pm. I was the charged $160 for repair fees when it too the repair guy literally 10 minutes to fix the over heat element. When I asked why the service fee was so high the service guy began to argue with me. NEVER AGAIN will I go through Sears.<//Review>

Regarding our Kenmore dishwasher -- We have had at least four repair visits to our house over the past year.... The first three were of no use in spite of new parts.  Finally we were told to request a senior service person - the only one who could declare the machine a lost cause and get us a replacement - perhaps.

Finally a senior service person came - fixed the machine in less that half an hour.  It works better than ever. ....  It appears that the first three visits were by people who were not adequately trained.  Sears wasted a lot of money sending out incompetent or not completely trained rep,,, this is a bad business model... You should spend more to train people - you will save money.< /review>

<Text>Technician was great...once he arrived.  Instead of wasting my Saturday morning, I ended up wasting my whole Saturday because he ran THAT late.  For crying out loud, our appt window was 8am to noon and around 9am, my husband was getting texts estimating the tech's arrival at around 2:30pm!  Phoned Customer Service number provided in the email I was sent to get a reason for the delay, but 3 times it bounced me back to the beginning of the menu after telling me I was "in queue" for the next available agent.  Gave up on the phone and tried online Chat.  All the Chat Agent could tell me was that the Tech was delayed at a previous appointment.  Sears needs better alternatives for when technicians get delayed on jobs so they don't end up with an entire day's worth of pissed off customers.< /Text>< username>

the part was not replaced per serviceman said new gasket was old and dirty, so nothing was changed on this visit.  Refrigerator door needs special attention to close after each opening.  this happened when right side gasket was changed.  Sears ordered the second gasket after discovering two right gasket was sent, the reordered, but in black instead of white.  Very disappointed with Sears service.

My refrigerator broke and was covered by a 5 years protection plan I had purchased from Sears..          I called them and had to wait 2 weeks for a service .and it's pretty hard to live without a fridge/freezer.   I called several more times to complain. They only send me a food loss claim. When I reschedule online for cash repair. They can come the next working day. This is the kind of service you get when you pay protection service agreement.I'm going to cancel my service agreement and have a local repairman come the next day. Hope I can get some money back for the years I did not ues< /text>

<Text>We've been dealing with Sears on repairs of our dishwasher since March 2016.  They have practically rebuilt it but it still doesn't work.  Now I have to wait an additional 1 month for the repair person to come out, again to try and fix and wait for another part.  Between them ordering parts, waiting for the parts, then scheduling the service man to come out, we are going past our 6th month of dealing with the repair.  They refuse to replace the dishwasher since they repair is under one repair number and they need four different repair numbers within 6 months.  I think this system is a scam.  Save your money and go to a more reputable service company that stand behind their work and repair quickly and count each visit as separate so if needed the warranty kicks in and you get a replacement appliance.</Text>< Pictures>

I cannot believe that since we got our Maytag fridge from Sears, that the delivery installer hooked up our water line to the Water heater and though we do have Ice Cubes, we cannot use our Water Dispenser.  We bought our Fridge from Sears in 2007, and we were never happy that the water dispenser only DRIPS water.

The last time we called Sears Repair, we again asked why the water cannot flow freely like other people's dispensers.  We were told that it is because whoever installed the water line probably didn't hook it up right and that we should call for a Plumber.  Since it has bothered us so long, we thought we'd follow  up again with Sears.  Seems why should we pay for a Plumber when Sears' Delivery Man didn't do the installation right -- also since we have an Extended Warranty why do we have to pay for our own Plumber when we did not cause this problem??   HELP?</review>

I had to bring in a  local repair guy to re do the dryer hook up Sears repair did.
Besides being a major fire hazard - the inside of the room was lining with moist hot air.
All the parts for the vent hose to be facing correct (original) direction remained on the counter after Sears left.
This was the third repair appointment for the washer this round. These guys, as I mentioned actually repaired the problem by rebuilding the entire machine in the middle of the business. Ok.
I guess leaving all the boxes/styrofoam in the middle of the room was MY problem.
Not impressed.< /Text>< pictures>

<user_name>Claudia Zervoulakos< /user_name><Review>We have been without a washer for almost 3 months. I've left numerous messages for supervisors, managers and have not been able to complete the repair on my washer. I even explained that we had a child with special needs and the washer was a necessity and we couldn't afford to keep washing at the laundermat. I've gotten no where. When they sell you products at Sears they tell you how great the service protection agreement is but what they don't tell you is parts take over a week and the next available appointments could be as far out as a month. I called and asked for the number of the coporate office and they said they couldn't give it to me. I'm considering calling channel 7 on your side or some other consumer support place.

Update!!!!!!!They sent someone out on Wednesday of this week. Those techs didn't stack the machines properly and now it's hard to open the soap compartment and surprise surprise it's still broken. I called their tech line four times today and was upset and each time the line mysteriously cut off. I never got to talk to a supervisor today. I have a new appt in two weeks. We are going on almost four months without a washer. Let me try emailing this email I was sent by the owner and I will keep you guys posted.<//Review>< Response>

The repair guy was good. My gripe is with the scheduling department. They schedule 3 weeks out, if a part is ordered is another 3 weeks out, and at the end it took 3 months to repair a dryer.</text>

I am sure the work is good, but three times in last year we have had repair people out. They each replaced parts, from shocks to hoses and parts relating to drum spinning.

The real irritating part is the continuous changing arrival times. Scheduled (almost a month in advance) for 10 AM till 2 PM.

An early phone call stated expect him around 11:45, then an email stating 11:30 to 1:30. A call, to dispatch said he was in Burlingame on a microwave call, at 11:AM and we were next call.
All service calls have been at the end of the time period. I understand scheduling, but not a new estimate every 20 minutes.

He arrived a bit after 1 PM.

I would think on 3rd service call Sears would make an effort to be earlier in the time period, particularly when I have bought so many appliances from Sears in last 3 years. Check your records!<//Text>

< Review>
The repairman showed up but demanded we indemnify him if he damaged our kitchen cabinets.  What?  That's crazy.  We called Sears who said, yes, that's crazy and rescheduled for a new repair person for 2 weeks later.  On that day, the repair person  never showed up , and when I called to find out where he or she was I was told a repairman had reported back to Sears that he did the job at 3:41 pm and the job was complete.  Wow.  Of course, Sears rescheduled me again - for 10 days later.  So now we will be waiting a third time for a repair person.  3 hour window each time.  So 9 hours of waiting for one repair person for a dishwasher.  And 4 four weeks with no repair.  Wow.  Colossally bad service.  And I paid extra for a 3 year repair insurance policy when I bought the dishwasher.  never again.  It should be 0 stars, but the review won't let me post 0.< /Review>

<Text>Repair was done well.  Technician was two hours later than the window assigned, but he did call and let me know.  The price was outrageous for what he did though.  Next time, I will go for a local, small company who won't charge crazy rates for an easy fix.  I watched what he did and I could have done it myself.  I just didn't know how to diagnose the  problem.  Felt a bit taken advantage of.<//Text>< Pictures>

First, I called to make a repair appt for a dishwasher. A technician called to say he would be coming by for a annual service. I told him I called for a repair. Another technician arrived the following day and told me the part was no longer available and advised me to follow up with the service department and he would notify his supervisor.
After a couple of days I called the service dept.to find out the repair ticket was closed out with no remarks about the unavailable part for my dishwasher. I asked to speak to the technicians supervisor and was told by the person assisting me that she would send an email to the techs supervisor and to wait for 2 days for a response. Well, since first called to make a repair appt, I have without the use of my dishwasher for 8 days. Thanksgiving is next week and I will be having a house full of people and tons of dishes! Had the service contract for 30 yrs and am NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER.< /text>

<Review>I called in to make an appointment to have my dryer repaired and was given  an appointment for over a week later. They cancelled that appointment and said they would be out  a week later. That appointment was cancelled and I was told it would be another week. I was very upset. I mentioned that it wasn't right to keep canceling my appointments as I was sure because we had a" service agreement" we kept being put to the bottom of the list and your service agent agreed that was true. I asked that she cancel someone else's appointment and she said they didn't do that, and I said you cancelled mine twice! Needless to say once the repair guy came out,he didnt have the part and said it would be 3-5 more days. The part actually came quick and the dryer was repaired at the end of the week. So..the actual repair was good but your customer service was the worst, EVER. I have bought all my appliances, washer and dryer at Sears but will look else ware from now on.< /Review>< pictures>

The worst company.  The technician who came to my house ordered the wrong part and as a result, I am still waiting over a month for my washer to be fixed.

The technician lied and closed my ticket even though he never fixed the problem.

I called his manager and he did not cared.  I called Sears and they too did not care.

Never trust Sears< /review>

<Text>The repair of my washer and dryer was the worst experience of my life. It required 3 different technician visits who all ordered different parts and it took close to 4 weeks to finally resolve. The only people i would give kudos to are Ruben and Bernard (3rd technicians) who finally got the washer working again. It's no surprise to me why Sears is going out of business. They have the worst customer service and the over experience is something i'll continue to tweet about given the cost and time it required to get a fully warrantied product operational again. #Sears#WakeUp#WorstCustomerService< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>Repair technician instructed us to wait an hour before use and we did. After waiting for a month for particular parts needed! Just to find out that NOTHING was repaired!! After reporting this to the repair co.,  we were put in a long line again, to wait for an appointment "to repair the previous repair", which we waited so long to get. So disgusted!!.

<user_name>Dan Ogawa<//user_name><Text>Washing machine door lock light stays on.  Tech came over - tech was very polite and very nice.  Did a few little things, then said the drum and tub need to be replaced.  It would be about $1000.  Told me about a warranty program that would save me 1/2 off my first visit plust would cover all other applicances - was only $49.00.  When I inquired more, he put me on the phone with a warranty salesperson:  real cost - $69.99...per MONTH....for 1 year PLUS, $100 for each visit...if they visit to diagnose, THEN come back when they have the parts - TWO visits, $200.  This is a scam.  Now I don't trust the tech's diagnosis.  Another tech from another company came by - said he thought it was the latch mechanism.  Didn't have the proper tools, said he'd come back - NO CHARGE since he didn't have the proper tools.  Sears:  their tech visits are leads for warranty sales (which are a scam), other company:  their techs come to fix your problem.</Text>< Date>

Parts for my electric range arrived two weeks after the order. Another 2 weeks passed after repair man showed up to make replacement. I lost 1 month of my warranty coverage! The repair person showed up 30 min late. It is unacceptable!!! 1/2 stars.</Text>

Water Heater repair service man was very knowlegeble.
How to fix water heater. He was very good. Water heater repair man was 5 star.

Sears  need to hire someone who can fix Mayteg Wash Machine.

We had schdule for repair man to come from 1-5 on 21st of March.
Repire man never came or call to say he is not going to come.
Sears again pushed repair appointment to another 2 weeks. April 6th.
Very bad service.<//review>

<Review>I ordered the replacement part from them and they shipped me a refurb and charged me the new part price.  Also they cancelled on one of my appointment because their guy was sick.  They never even gave me a courtesy call to let me know and I stayed at home waiting.  I had to call to find out that they had cancelled.  They refused to compensate me for my time and I had to take another day off to wait for their guy to show the next time.  Their action is so unprofessional.  Don't use them!!!</Review>< pics>

Will never buy or deal with Sear's again. They lost a customer for life and if anyone asked who I recommend it surely won't be Sear's. I bought ALL my appliance from them before and I bought it for 3 dwellings. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THIER CUSTOMERS AND THEIR TECHINCHIAN'S are liars. Didn't want to give them 1 star but if I didn't you wouldn't know what a crappy  service they provide.</Review><Rating>1</Rating>< Pictures>

We have had an awful experience with the warranty and repairs done on our refrigerator/freezer. We purchased the warranty, as everyone does at point of purchase. The item is less than 2 years old and we have had service come out a number of times. This last visit has got to be the best. Service came out and told me that there was a problem with the temp in the freezer and refrigerator, which was freezing the food in the fridge and over freezing the food in the freezer... he ordered parts and said someone will be out in 10 days. Yes, 10 days to fix it. 10 days rolls around another service man comes... and says "well whats wrong with it". Seriously? You have got to be kidding me... look at your computer that youre just carrying around for the numerous documentations noted. At the end, he said... "ok its fixed" meaning the freezer, and when asked, can you double check the fridge to make sure that the temp is ok on that side, his response "I dont work on fridges". Seriously, its one damn unit. OVER IT!!!! WILL NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM SEARS</Text>

We have Sears Maint. agreement on all our appliances. All appliances are working fine except our GE Refrig which has been giving us problem for many years. We have had 6 or 7 calls on this. The past two years, the problem has been ice maker and water dispenser not working. On two ocassions, the maint. guy just said to change the water filter. After a week or so, some problem. Many of the parts have been replaced, including the last one which was a faulty filter housing. Hopefully, I will not have to call them back in few months with another problem.<//Review>

So here is my story, we had a power outage in our house with a PG&E power spike. The  fridge then stopped working.  We had to move the fridge onto our veranda so that we could put the spare one inside.   The Sears Repair man turned up 3 days later to do his work and basically abused my wife over the fridge being outside, he then sat in his truck and sulked for the entire time, did nothing much and then declared the fridge not fixable.

I then took it upon myself to google the wiring diagram and with the aid of a multi meter worked out the faulty switch (the $10 master on off switch).  So I fixed that and saved myself $2800 in replacement costs.

The Sears tradesman was pathetic.</Text>

I would give no stars if I could.  We called Sears to repair our washing machine in May 2nd and they finally repaired it on Aug 28.  Through a series of blunders, broken parts showing up ,  the repair person not showing up on scheduled days and never once making any kind of accommodations for their issues, we had to wait 4 months to fix an appliance.  We were long time Sears customers but not any more</Text>

<text>I am complaining about the scam of the master protection agreement. Horrible.  I have had a beautiful kitchenaide range in mint condition (as noted by the technician) for 11 years and the knob that controls the burner broke and the flame would not go out,  had to call the fire department for help.  The range is and always has been covered under the sears protection agreement for the last 11 years. sears came out said that part was not covered but labor was. then had another guy come out and told me part was not available so we are out of luck even though we are covered under the master protection agreement. I now have no range, amd out the cost of the warranty.  Sears realized they cant get the part and did not want to pay for a replacement. they are scam artists and am emabarrased I ever spent any money with Sears. Also, side note I have never had to call sears for the range ever and I also called kitchenaide after 11 years the part is normal wear and tear and Sears should have fixed it. also did research that this has happened to other customers with this same range. Sahme on you Sears. After 11 years we supported and believed in you.< /text>< Pictures>

Sears contrast other company to do the repair. The lady asked for $79 after looking at my cook top which the Sears didn't tell me that I have to pay when I schedule my appointment. I paid extra to purchase the extended care plan so I can have protection when there is a problem. I was very dispointed when the lady asked me to pay.

<review>It was awful!  And the issue STILL isn't resolved after 2 visits.  Water just poured out of my dishwasher again and need to schedule another visit from a repair person, hopefully a different one than the one who already came twice.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>The technician that was assigned for the repair was terrible. He was supposed to call me to give me status as to about how soon he would arrive, but he never called.

When the technician showed up, he was supposed to repair a leaking problem but instead he made the leak WORSE!

I sent in three pages for him to call me about the terrible work he did and if he could come back, he NEVER returned any calls, never came back, never responded to any of the people paging him< /Review>< Date>

The repair person showed up on time, performed maintenance and helped us to troubleshoot what caused the malfunction of our fridge. I am not giving 5 stars because the first appointment we had made was canceled after we waited for 6 hours, totally wasting our time. I would have rather waited longer to get the fridge repaired then have an appointment that was not honored.</Text>

<review>Called Affordable Brake and Tire to schedule an appointment, I was told to bring it in the next day first thing in the morning. I took the car in and told Domingo that the car is making a rattling noise. The is very noticeable, can not miss it .  Around 2:30 he said did not hear any noise and does not have time to diagnose any further and to schedule an appointment in two weeks. I did that. Two weeks later I Deliver the car to Affordable Brake and Tire at 8:00 am. Around 3:00 pm Domingo calls and says cant’t hear any noise, but then in the same sentence he says the noise could be coming from the back end of the engine. Domingo tells me I should take it to the Toyota dealership to figure out the problem. If he would told me that the first time I took the car in I would not be writing this. The problem here isn’t that he can’t fix the car it is the time I have wasted. In total I have wasted 3 weeks not having my car repaired. My time is worth something too!!!<//review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

I fully recommend using Affordable Brake and Tire!! We had the check engine light come on our 2005 Nissan truck and the mechanics did an excellent job in fixing the problem - that another shop couldn't figure out. We got our truck back quickly and at the agreed upon cost. I have been to many other shops and this place goes above and beyond for their customers. Our truck is running great now and we would not hesitate to use them again. Thank you Affordable crew!!< /text>

Domingo and his staff really can't be beat. He's a great mechanic but more importantly you can trust him. If you don't need something, he won't recommend it. My family has been going to Domingo for well over 10 years and every time we refer someone to him they stick with him. There's a reason for that<//review>

They were dishonest about their pricing. An advertisement outside said, "Allignment Special- $49.99!" When I got up to the counter to sign papers, the price jumped to $59.99. When I asked why, they said that the special wasn't going on any longer.

Well then take that sign down! Unless you are just dishonest. You are suppose to honor the price advertised. I won't be back.<//text>

DO NOT GO HERE!!! THEY ARE CROOKS!!! I was sent to them by a different tire shop for a minor $30 lug bolt replacement. The guy who sent me told me it would be about $30 total for the repair. When I get to "AFFORDABLE" BRAKE & TIRE the girls in the office told me it would be $180 and take two and a half hours to repair. I immediately left "AFFORDABLE " BRAKE&TIRES and I went straight to DISCOUNT TIRES where they completed the job for $29 in about 20 minutes!<//text>

< review>
So ive always recomended this place to all my co workers and people i know, but when i took my car in to get it checked due to oil leak.the owner told me that it was too dirty you need to steam clean. Your under carage befor i work on it..i was like ok that why im bringing it to you so you can figure out the problem.seemed like he didnt want to work on the car and sent me on my way.what kind of mechanic shop does that after im a repeted costumer.so i took it to discount tire on mooney and they told me exactly what was wrong with it.A TIRE shop figured out my problem..and told me i need a new valve cover gasket. No need to steam clean my  under carage they knew exactly what my problem was in less then 30 min, i will no longer bring my bussines hear to affordable Horrible costumer experience..</review>

<Text>A great children's park with a baseball field and skatepark next to it. During quarantine, at least on this day, it wasn't busy so it was nice to let the kids out and enjoy some sun. Would highly recommend it, but let's not all descend on it at once and be good until things settle down 😉<//Text>< Pictures>

After the new turf on the kids playground HOA stated the amount of money spent.  It actually looks and feels the same, crappie old playground.  Waste of money and resources.  Guess HOA doesn't know how to spend the resident's money.</text>

<review>Meh. It's hit and miss. There are a lot of teenagers hanging around the skate park so you have to watch out because some of them are cocky little jerks. Aside from that there are usually lots of kids and parents on the baseball and soccer fields. They have basket ball courts and one tennis court so you usually have to wait which can get awkward because they don't have wait time rules like they do at Salt Creek.<//review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><rate>3< /rate>< Name>

<time>1621113413234< /time><Review>I taught yoga here for two spring sessions and they were lovely experiences. The facilities are excellent, clean and airy with great light. Especially the common kitchen area off the swimming pool!
The residents were also lovely and friendly and worked very well together. Even the kids who took my classes with their parents were focused and dedicated- and well behaved!
The front desk person was always friendly, welcoming and helpful.
And I look forward to teaching here again.< /Review>< pics>

DO NOT TAKE AN APARTMENT HERE, The quality is poor, windows leak water and management tries to blame you for these kind of problems.

They even told that water might get collected as we might be breathing more (funny but true). I dont know how humans can produce water now!</Text>

<text>My partner and I have absolutely loved living at the Uptown. In particular, I want to highlight our recent maintenance request experience that prompted me to leave this review.

I reported my plumbing issues (clogged sink drain, and leaking pipe) on Friday evening, and Alex Whitaker picked up the request and fixed it Saturday morning! Alex gave us clear explanations for the issues, and told us how we could avoid them in future. He fixed the issues and also verified that the leak did not cause any water damage. I am thoroughly impressed by Alex's professionalism and work, and hope he picks up my future maintenance requests as well.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I spent 3,5 years in this community. In this time period the best thing was maintenance! Zachary Green was always helpful tracked every problem, followed up, our issues solved in max 12h. Great location, easy access for all Bay Area locations (bart station, highway connection, bus stop). Thank you all< /text>

<review>This review is primarily directed at Zachary Green, who in many ways brings out the best in this place. Prior to Zach's arrival i along with many others had many issues with management, they were either completely unresponsive or overly and unnecessarily aggressive.  It was a consistent disappointment dealing with the staff. When Zach arrived it was a much needed influx of professionalism, decency and frankly a breath of much needed fresh air. Zach's highly infectious positive and kind mannerisms have helped to smooth out many management issues. We had considered leaving Uptown due to the continued dissatisfaction we ran into amongst previous staff and yet we are still here because of Zach. He is a manager who ensure residents needs are consistently met, ensures staff is responsive and bestows upon the properties a warmth that is unmistakable. The Uptowns single greatest amenity is by far Zach.<//review><rate>4<//rate><time>1618436344867< /time>< Pics>

I lived here for 3 years, and they were great. Yeah, it's Oakland. You can't stop Oakland from being Oakland. But Zachary and the crew really do their best to make sure you're treated like a person. And you get your 1-3 packages a day ++ parking garage<//Text>

Excellent location, safe and clean, fair pricing (at least on my unit, relative to what I was paying for for way less space in SF). Would recommend.

This place is a hit and miss. The price is reasonable if you want to save on rent and it's fairly comfortable as well. Package pick up is safe and secure. The staff really do try to help out when they can. Now the cons: if your call does not get to the person you're calling for, nobody will ever return your call so there is 0 point leaving a message. They are helpful but also probably stretched very thin and not very organized. If you're patient or don't mind asking a few times you will have it sorted out. If you're impatient and expect fast resolution you will be disappointed. Otherwise our stay has been pleasant! Just don't expect the Ritz< /Review>

Very rude when speaking to customers. Was trying to become a resident and they were very blunt and not helpful at all. I was very willing to have a conversation and they clearly were not. This new management company is by far the worst that I've dealt with.Would rather be on the street than live in their establishment.</Review>

<text>Outdated appliances, hotheaded maintenance man, mediocre amenities (when they’re actually open). Do yourself a favor and find a different place to live. There are plenty of other apartments in this price range with rooftops that are also modern and at least pretend to care about their tenants.

There’s also a police outpost here (for “tenant safety”), no air conditioning, and terrible soundproofing.

Try Town29, Bell Uptown, ZO, 17th & Broadway, Essex, or literally any other apartment building.< /text>< Date>

< Review>
The amenities are quite nice- the pool and gym are open late and accessible. Management is typically pretty unresponsive to issues. Any amenity that’s included in your lease may go out of service for an extended period of time- from pool and gym access to elevators. We lost gym access while living here for over a month. This wouldn’t have been a serious issue but we saw no rent reduction.

Rooms are nice and either carpeted or tiled. Kitchen ventilation is terrible- a sautéed onion will smoke up the entire apartment. In unit washer dryer though!

I would warn that the neighborhood is not nearly as “up and coming” as we were sold on. There were two shootings at kaiser park during our residency, one fatal.

For the price, I would not recommend moving here.<//Review>

<text>The management is very slow at resolving issues. Elevators often doesn't work and maintenance is slow, doesn't anything usually gets resolved.

The bathroom vents doesn't have fans, so if you have smoking neighbors, be ready to live in smoke filled rooms and all your clothes smelling like weed!

Though the apartments are good and leasing process was much easier compared to going through a landlord. In general the management is quick to respond, but it is just talk, they don't do anything to get issues resolved, blaming contractors and upper management.<//text></record></dataset><record>

The management is good but this place is really getting weird. Every weekday at night (11 PM, sometimes 1 AM) some random people hang out in front of the building with loud speakers from their car. Weekends are even more unbearable. Sometimes people are fighting outside after midnight. Also, there was a murder in the park in front of the building a couple month ago! Sleeping is becoming a big issue here. We are considering moving out to a place which we can have a good night sleep. I do not recommend this place at all.<//text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>My apartment is nice and the pool, hot tub, and gym are great amenities to have, but some residents treat the place like a trash can. Good news is maintenance cleans up fairly quickly. Very secure and lots of good food and night life in the area. Perfect location if you have an active social life. Very close to BART and the highway. I don’t care for the management or leasing staff. Not sure if they hate their jobs or don’t like dealing with residents but I don’t find them genuinely welcoming.  They are also not great at keeping appointments, at least not with me. Last thing to know, we get lots of car break ins on the surrounding streets so don’t leave things in your car.< /review>< Gmap_id>

<review>I really can't say anything bad about this apartment complex. Convenient, close to BART, Lake Merritt, bars, restaurants, etc, etc. From the reviews I've read, people complain about high rent, management, security and maintenance. Well, rent anywhere in Downtown Oakland is high, it's a reality. Management is fairly new and doing a fantastic job upgrading the building and fixing the issues with prior staff and building. It's night and day compared to the management they had prior!!!! Management is friendly and very accommodating as well. Instead of shying away until you have a bigger issue, say hi and chat with them, get to know them alittle better before forming an opinion. Security just changed over, so give it time and a chance. As for maintenance, I've never had to wait more than 24-48 hours. The only time I had to wait longer was due to supply, they had to order materials which is nothing out of the ordinary. All in all, I've loved living here the last 3 years and hope to stay a year or so longer until I move out of state.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>The fire alarms go off constantly, good luck if you work from home. Problems take forever to get fixed, like when dirty water leaking into the garage. They've lost my packages for weeks at a time. The management is often unhelpful in resolving issues. When I moved in, they forgot to do an inspection. They removed garbage cans from the property, which has led to litter becoming a problem. Residents hot box the stairwells. The elevators sometimes just don't read your key fob and you have to take the stairs. Amenities are unavailable for months at a time. Packages can take 12 hours or more after they've been delivered to be sorted so you can pick them up. You can't copy your keys. Items have been stolen from my car in the garage.

The list goes on. Just don't live here. It's not worth it. I won't be renewing my lease.<//Text>< username>

<Text>The Uptown has 3 pet-free buildings, but there are many apartments in each of them with multiple pets (let alone one), and management does nothing to enforce their pet-free policy.

There is also enough dog poop and urine in the building common areas (garage, corridors and stairs) to make you think you are in San Francisco, and not Oakland. Even after multiple calls, no clean up is done.< /Text><UserId.>106477333239855278100< /UserId.>< user_name>

We are really disappointed at this place now. We have done graduation parties at this place before with the old management, with absolutely no problems. But this time after we reserved and paid for the patio space for my friend's graduation, we were told that they double booked so the only space available for us was the kitchen space. We agreed to take the kitchen area, which we were told we could have upto 20 people. We got there on the afternoon of the party to decorate the place and have it ready before our guests got there only to find out, there were literally four chairs available for us to work with. When we asked for more, we were told "we didn't say we have twenty chairs, we just told you that you could have twenty people." No apologies or anything like that. The lady (didn't get her name but she could be of an Indian descent (we were told she is a new manager)), with a very condescending and bad attitude told us "there is a difference between 20 people and 20 chairs." Are you kidding me?! Where did you expect us to sit 20 people then. Common sense? We did not want to make a scene as we didn't want to mess up our party but after they gave away the place we reserved, they don't even tell us they did not have enough chairs at the day of our party?!
We were forced to transport extra chairs from our church...More than anything, it's the attitude of that lady that really bothered us. We paid for the place you gave away and this is how you treat your guests?! How shameful of you! I have worked in a similar position before, customer service is one of the most important things to keep people coming. The new management clearly lack it big time.
Otherwise we managed to have a great time there. The night staff were nicer and more courageous, esp.after I told them what happened.< /text>

The management refused to fix the issue for 11 months. The issue is that air vents are all connected to apartments below and above your floors and if anybody is smoking weed inside their apartments my unit was getting filled with smoke.

I have called the managers and emailed them several times, they rarely reply to the email and never picked up their phone or returned back the voicemails.

One day the smoke inside our unit was so bad my wife was feeling very nauseous and had to taken to hospital and ended up calling the cops. The very next day the issue was resolved and the manager Patty returned the calls for very first time!

The same happened on moving out, they never returned my email and voicemail notice left that I'm not extending the lease if they are not ready to give any compensation for the 11 months in the smoke filled apartment. On moving out as if it is a revenge they slapped a $500+ fee for not giving them notice for moving out, on top of already deducting the $500 deposit.

The management didn't even had the courtesy to ask me to pay the remaining dues (or the revenge fee) and they send it to a debt collector, who is threatening me if I don't pay that amount they are going to report to my credit!< /review>< pics>

COVID Update: Fire alarm problems mostly seem to be resolved now, yay! Now onto the other stuff. We’ve been paying hefty rent with no access to facilities and what not, due to COVID. That’s to be expected, but the apartment is definitely NOT worth what we’re paying now. Good news is that prices are lower for new people coming in. Bad news is it’s still expensive for people already living here. Their measly attempts to “help” each other out during COVID have included passing around a single roll of toilet paper a couple weeks ago, well after the toilet paper crisis was over. They did give us microwave popcorn and some Twizzlers. I guess that was all they could afford with the extra $400-600 they’re making every month off current tenants. Long story short, they’re just another investment company looking out for themselves, which is exactly what I’d expect in the current economic/political climate. *high five Uptown team*

Previous Review:
This apartment complex's fire alarms go off ever other week, usually at night. No meaningful effort has been put into security around the building. The cost of rent simply does not justify the headaches I've encountered living here.

Update 12/21: Yet another fire alarm. I've never lived in a place that has this many issues.

Update 12/26: Fire alarm goes off again.

Update 1/16: Another fire alarm

Update 4/5: We almost made it 3 months without an alarm, that's got to be a record! But alas, fire alarm went off again.</Text>

Not the experience they sell you on. The people in the stores are not dental professionals and you never actually talk with the orthodontist.< /Review>

<text>Candid had a promotional period where they were giving out free whitening pens, so of course I had to come in! My impressions weren't coming out correctly, so I made an appointment online and scheduled to get my pictures taken in the SF office.

Michael and Maria were extremely helpful and made me feel welcome for my short visit there. Michael directly helped me out with my 3D teeth scans (extremely cool!) and answered all my questions I had about the Candid experience and what to expect. We talked about a lot of the benefits that come with teeth alignment, so I got to learn a lot as well. I appreciate that he decided to go the extra mile to educate about Candid, I think that is very cool.

The payment process with Affirm makes the whole idea of getting teeth aligners very easy. I didn't have anything set up in terms of a payment schedule/financing beforehand, and I got set up within 5 minutes and will be receiving my treatment plan in a couple weeks :)

Thanks for the tote bag to Michael also, he was so helpful! Appreciate it. The SF office will take care of you if you are thinking of stopping by in person/the impressions are too difficult.

I scheduled my appointment no problem, went in and saw Jay- he was amazing and super informative. We took some pictures of my teeth, went over payment options and I was in and out within an hour. The process was easy and I was satisfied with the customer service from beginning to end. I would definitely recommend Candid!< /Review>

<Review>Loved my experience at Candid Clear Aligners with the best Care Specialist Jay! Highly recommend coming in to get your fitting, they are so helpful,  informative and fun! Not sure how people do it at home by themselves because they go in so much depth to ensure a perfect analysis of your whole mouth which is clearly extremely important in this process!  I’m so excited to start this journey with Candid, I’ll keep ya posted!<//Review><Rate>5< /Rate><response>None< /response>< Pics>

<text>Location is fairly easy to find. Paul was really friendly and comforting as I’m pretty nervous about putting on my aligners. They are so snug that when I tried to take them off it feels like I’m taking my teeth off with it. Paul reassured me that it’s ok to proceed and guided me through the entire process. I’m glad that Candid had me go back into their office so they can show me how to use their product instead of me having to guess based on a series of videos like I had imagined. Thanks!<//text></record>

I visited the studio to start the process of getting my bite adjusted, I already went through the candid treatment and my dentist felt my bite needed review.

I booked the appointment on line in just a few steps. The office was easy to find and the staff was very friendly and welcoming. My session and experience with the new image - based modeling was smooth and painless. I enjoyed talking with the technician taking the images. She explained everything clearly and answered all my questions.

I've been very happy with my candid co results and experience. The studio experience makes it even better.</Text>

Great experience!  Tania was patient, professional, thoroughly knowledgeable, and very candid (pun intended).  I never felt pressured or that there was something hidden from me, I was comfortable throughout the whole process.  I definitely recommend this location as well as the company itself!< /Review>

Great experience! Kaliva was very helpful, patient, and professional. She clearly answered my questions and completed the procedure smoothly and quickly. The studio is very nice and I appreciated the bamboo toothbrush and other simple sustainability measures. The technology is fascinating.</text>

I had a great experience here at the candid studio on front street, SF. They made me feel really comfortable. The studio is beautiful, and they talk about all of the details very clearly and confidently. I’m so happy I came here! Tiana was so great to me I can’t wait for my new smile!
Ps! It’s Incredibly affordable!<//review>

<Review>I came to the studio, here, as I had tried to do the impressions on my own last summer. I wasn't able to complete them perfectly even after the second batch of impressions. The studio experience was EASY! Not only are the staff organized and welcoming, but the scan and expert photography skills makes this a smooth experience. I was having trouble with the photographs, too.

I needed this to complete the liners which are coming very soon. I will be finished with my course of liners within 6 months. I am so delighted to be on my way to straight teeth (again) as an adult. I had braces as a teen and my teeth shifted.

Thanks to the smart and competent SF Candid Studio!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Scheduling the appointment was very easy and I even rescheduled the first time at no cost. When I finaly did the appointment, Kaliva was awesome with the whole process. She did great to explain the process as we did the scans and the photos. In addition it was easy to use my HSA to pay for the entire treatment upfront with a studio discount. Can't wait to see how the treatment goes.< /text>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>Customer service has been very poor so far, and I'm starting to wonder if this is a scam. Buyer beware. I paid in full in the beginning of December after a consultation at this branch. Thereafter, I received no email communication or any other communication and no liners. I checked with the headquarters in the end of December, and they indicated that the customer service rep inputted my email address incorrectly (off by a letter) and that they would fix it and start my process. After that, I received a phone call from another representative who wanted to show me my treatment via an app that they use, Gruveo. Although I downloaded it, the system was down on their end. She said our conversation was good enough and my liners would be shipped. Fast forward three weeks, and I call the branch to see what is going on. The representative who answered the phone took my name and said he'd call me back after he finds out. No call. Remember, I've paid $2000.00 in full at this point and have received nothing -- not even an email. Today, I message with their Facebook representative. They put out so many ads that you'd think they'd invest in customer service as well. The representative told me that liners were shipped and that I haven't received any emails because they had the wrong email address for me -- and that they'd "work on that issue." How hard is it to correct an email address in your system? And for this error to take over a month to correct is unacceptable. I then told her I didn't receive the liners and asked for a tracking number. The response: "The tracking number was provided in the previous message - again - the number is..." and then proceeded to provide me a link. Yes, a tracking number was included in the last message but there was no indication if was UPS or USPS or what? The snarkiness and overall incompetency is appalling. I responded that I don't even have an address within the zip code where the liners were shipped. Since then, they have gone radio silent. I'm not sure if I will need to spend time bringing a small claims suit now. If you want to avoid this headache, avoid this company. I reported them to the BBB and will take further action if I don't get a full refund.<//Review>< Pics>

The staff at Candid are super kind, informative, and helpful! Went in for my first scan appointment, which took about an hour total, and they explained everything I needed to know.<//Text>

<text>Lexy took care of all my dental needs. Her customer service was impeccable and perfect. I have never been so well taken care of dentally. I’d bring my mother in just to meet her if I could. The way she explained everything to me before she performed her service made me feel so safe and at home. This location was so clean and well establish. The “Starbucks-like” music Playlist was on fleek. I have nothing but good things to say. Again lexy was great. Someone should give her a raise!< /text>< GmapID>

I had seen so many ads via Instagram that I decided to give candid a try. The price point for $1900 wasn’t bad since getting regular braces had been about 3-5k not including the cost of retainers. When I went into the office it was super clean, and I was welcomed immediately after arriving. Kiana helped me out today and she was very knowledgeable about my teeth as well as making sure I was comfortable and that all of my questions were answered. She didn’t try to push a sale on me instead she wanted to help me explore options as far as my payment plan since 2k upfront is quite a lot. She was patient with me and gave me a really nice discount to start my plan.

I would definitely recommend anyone to go give candid a try if they are looking to get braces and want to cut the cost. The technology they use is extremely advance as far as getting impressions of my teeth and the 3D imaging that they use. I felt very comfortable throughout the whole process and I was able to find a payment plan that I could afford monthly with Kiana’s help.

Will be returning to pick up my swag bag!! Thanks again to the entire staff at candid!! You guys are great.< /Text>

<response>None<//response><Text>Great service!

Made an appointment, filled out the forms on the iPad, brushed my teeth, then they scanned my mouth to create the 3D model of my teeth. I got to ask questions and the rep answered all of them (didn't catch his name; cool black dude).

Impressively seamless process! Looking forward to getting started with the actual alignment. I don't think I'll need any, but -- wish me luck!

Constructive feedback for Candid: my rep was a little hard to hear in the booth relative to the music, so I'd turn the music down a bit. For your web devs/designers: on the consent form, when a section is filled out completely/correctly, change the color of its section name (listed in the upper left) from red to green rather than green to red (red == bad, green == good); this was slightly confusing.

Good stuff!<//Text><UserId.>115900427380440360095</UserId.><Rate>5< /Rate><user_name>Steve Phillips< /user_name>< gmap_id>

< Review>
I booked my appointment at the front street location since BART drops you off mere blocks away. (very limited street parking). the office itself is tiny, however, the area is nicely lit, clean and decorated. Each area is sectioned off by fancy paper walls, so there is visual privacy while you have your appointment, but not audio. everyone working there was very nice, approachable, and professional. My appointment was with Kaliva, who exemplified all of those qualities. The appointment is very painless and easy and everything is explained to you while its occurring. There was one part where i had gum sensitivity, and Kaliva was very accommodating for me.
I have two negatives for this review, Kaliva used gloves (yay) for the duration of my appointment, while her hands were in/near my mouth. But she did not remove said gloves when touching things she should not have, like the sign-in ipad.
Second, i signed up for this appointment on cyber Monday and knew i would be getting a certain amount off the total cost, and i was told i would get a free gift. had i not mentioned this during my appointment, i would NOT have been given those things!</Review>

I honestly had no idea what to expect coming in for my first Candid appointment. Kaliva at the studio was informative about the whole process and made sure I had all my questions answered about payment options. Not to mention she was great at capturing photos of my teeth and face (to send for later diagnosis and treatment by orthodontist ). I even learned a thing or two from her that night about teeth conditions :) At any rate, I am feeling pretty good so far about my decision to try this treatment out thanks to a smooth onboarding by this studio's team. You're in good hands if you book your first appointment here!</Text>

<review>Just came from your office on 225 Front Street and am very disappointed with my experience. After taking time off from work, I arrive and after filling out a questionnaire am turned away because I have upcoming dental work. I asked to still be seen because I wanted to see if the proposed offer would give me the results I hoped for. To my surprise, they still refused and offered to reschedule after I’ve had my work done. No thanks. What a waste of time. Perhaps have potential clients fill out the questionnaire before wasting their time. This will be my first and last visit. @smiledirectclub has much better customer service!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<UserId.>108497091621682455109< /UserId.><review>I’m very impressed by this place. I’ve been impressed with Candid’s customer service quite a bit so far (been using them 8+ months because my teeth were f’d up and now look almost perfect) and this was my first time at a Popup/office.

The folks I dealt with (Tiana, Lexie & another guy whose name escapes me- sorry man) were really friendly and well-trained. They made the process (needed a re-scan and some refinements) really fun and easy. You can tell they enjoy their jobs and the company hires properly. They understood the process and were pretty expert at taking the scans as well.

As I’ve said I recommend candid and if you want to get your scans done I definitely recommend this office/location as well.< /review>< gmap_id>

<text>I visited the SF location back in November. I was given a great bamboo toothbrush and some toothpaste before we started. Angee was very informative, took her time with me, explained everything very thoroughly and answered all my questions. Angee was thorough with the 3D imaging and let me watch the whole thing. The technology process blew my mind!! All the staff was also very nice and the office looks amazing - clean and modern. After my appointment, I got to leave with a bag of swag ;). I'm already on my 3rd tray and doing well so far. =) Angee has followed up with me as my treatment has come along and it's been going pretty well.< /text><GmapID>0x80858166aa595879:0x9f5148cec4687bdd< /GmapID>< Rating>

I came here last night and everything went perfectly! I called ahead of time to ask a few questions and they helped me out. Then when I got there the girls were very helpful and explained the whole process. Domenique did my scan and answered allll my questions and Kaliva was also there, she also gave me all kinds of information. I am waiting for my treatment plan now, so far I am glad I chose this company!!< /review>

My gf is writing this review lol

I've aten here for about 20yrs and the food has always been delicious!!! Its like a mixture of Chris's Burgers and In n Out. I always get their cheeseburger special and the milkshakes are delicious too! This place needs more publicity, it definitely deserves more love than it gets by having such good food 😩😋< /Text>

Nice property. Very different the way some of the buildings are located throughout the property. Hot tub was outside and definitely used. Water was good and looked clean in both hot tub and pool. Towels were brought out poolside. I enjoyed this hotel.<//review>

Really nice stay here during a conference. Staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were spacious and the grounds were really nice. I was surprised that I was charged extra for parking, was not told that in advance.</Text>

<Review>Very nice resort-style hotel. Room was large, clean and well appointed. Grounds were beautiful with a small pond and waterfall and plenty of room to stroll.

Restaurant and bar are housed separately from the main building and are very nicely done.</Review>< resp>

<name>Todd Bower< /name><time>1519085798741<//time><rate>5</rate><text>This was a great hotel. I had planned to stay here for a couple of nights and then try out another hotel, but decided that once I got to the room that I needed to stay. The room was huge, the bathroom was spacious and very adequate. A nice little balcony to enjoy the great San Diego weather. The only small complaint I had was that the grounds crew was up using their gas powered blowers around 7:30 am in the morning as I was trying to sleep in. The restaurant served a great breakfast and the hotel bar was pretty good. I’d recommend this hotel for a nice getaway.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQ8syMUC4jl3v0p5VmV3LoZzM0gzOJs7gnNluQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

<review>Sorry folks, I was so busy having fun. I didn't get to take many pictures. Ideal location 22 minutes away from any beach and good cheap food. Definitely in the cut for someone  looking for privacy. Parking is 13.95 per night charged after check out. The food isn't good. It tastes like cafeteria food for the elderly. Ed Everything else here is winning.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsnYDprqzgbu4ZThidXccpvNtz6D59cnNrrJXl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Response>

A little more difficult to find your room, but we liked it much better than the typical hotel.  Have to pay extra for parking, but maybe able to ask for a discount or maybe a couple of free breakfast vouchers.  Buffet breakfast is awesome and everything was fresh with great variety, but way too expensive at around $20. Overall we highly recommend this place, one of our favorites in the area, rooms are on the higher end of the price scale</Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Great place to stay.  Service is top notch.  Decore is modern and beautiful.  Located 1 min from the highway. Breakfast is great,  and so is happy hour.</Text>

I liked pretty much everything about it except the view. The room they gave us had glass sliding doors in the bedroom, like all the other rooms, except ours looked onto the lot and Boulevard. The shower's hot water function was a challenge. The grounds are beautiful.< /text>

First, I must say,  is that we drove at least 7hrs last night and stopped for MUST SLEEP an away from here.. (so needless to say, but I'm going to anyway for the safe of this review) Once we finally got here we were overjoyed to finally arrive from our 500 mile trip.. But Somehow there was a misunderstanding about the room type.. and at first I wasn't happy at all! So when I talked to the man at the front desk, he was so Kind and considerate, to see how exhausted we were and some how worked his magic, and got our room, and turned us from a grumpy tired family,  to Relaxed, relieved, and 100% grateful we stayed with Hotel Karlan!🤩😁😎😀<//Text>

I love the area but staying wasn't all that  great. The location is what you're paying. We had issues with services and other amenities. The first night we had issues with the refrigerator, we called the front and someone came to fixed it. It didn't seemed he fixed anything but when he left my partner just broke the ice that made the refrigerator not work. The next day the refrigerator finally worked. So when you see your refrigerator have a block of ice in the back just break it. Also I really wanted to have a hot tub to enjoy. There's a hot tub and pool. However, the pool area was not clean. Debris all over the pool furniture and there was no towels. If you do go take your towel. We called for them to deliver towels it took them aprox. 30 mins to give us towels. We weren't the only people to call for towels. Lastly there is no Wi-Fi. The only great thing is the location. There are so many plazas to go and shop.
Other cons to consider are:
Pay $15 parking a day.
There's no sky view in any direction.
Gift shop is bogus
No bath tub in the room
Pros:
Location
Quiet area
Cookies
Decent hot tub<//Review>

My favorite hotel in SD, but mainly for the Blackhorse pub. The people working at Blackhorse pub are some of the most friendly, down to earth people I have ever met. I always look forward to coming here and meeting these guys. The food is fantastic.< /review>

<username>Bernard Haarmans</username><Date>1565899209060<//Date><rating>2< /rating><text>The photos are a bit misleading at this hotel. Reality is that this hotel today is in need of a refurbishment. Shower is dirty, stuff like iron board is falling apart.

But what strikes the most is the layout of this hotel: a system of dirty back alleys with several stairs lead to the rooms. Not exactly what you would expect at a hotel. Very inaccessible with luggage.

They also charge $13 per day for parking!< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzyn7hySpGcFZXj8BCwVuQ8SiHIClvDY7R3HNQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_DlwZI7g2QXkniohLLtwwNzHlZdiI-HaMcFvG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRr5VzYL4gc41aI3nq-5ptc5z0V0aHTvSfW6sE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPiFA-pJXpZKAFo9DDESh9WkzCBwP6Y1aG0AXK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

At the check-in counter, we experienced terrible customer service. Hotel staff did not welcome guests as Hilton Honors members, even to its elite members. The front desk staff, who told us that she was the manager, acted unprofessionally with no smile and rude attitude. As a Hilton gold/diamond members, we always get complimentary breakfast for our little kid, but not at this hotel. When we questioned about the breakfast charge for the kid, the front desk staff told us to call the Hilton diamond desk ourselves to resolve this... I totally agree with some of the reviews that this is not a Hilton experience. By far, this is definitely the worst customer service and room quality we have experienced... We paid about $200 a night. The room was very dirty and toilet didn't flush when we initially arrived. The water in the toilet would actually back up and splash out after flushing. Extremely disgusting!!! :-( The technician came over but didn't fix the problem correctly and it actually became worse after fixing so my family ended up using the restrooms in the lobby, very inconvenient!! In fact, there were lots of gross mold around the toilet. Mold in the shower as well. Spiders on the bathroom floor. The spare toilet paper was ripped/deformed with hole (by the way the toilet tissues are very bad quality), scratches on wall, dirty carpet, etc... In conclusion, the management and staff at this hotel are very unprofessional and dishonest by avoiding responsibilities. This hotel doesn't live up to the Hilton standard!!!! ☹️< /Review>

<review>Just left the hotel and wow! The front desk service was excellent- very kind, friendly, accommodating, and generous. Water and Hilton cookies were offered and gladly accepted. The room was spacious, clean, and private- a welcomed sight compared to so many generic rooms. I will never stay at another hotel while in San Diego. This was simply the most incredible stay and the price was beyond fair.< /review>< Pics>

Staff (Madison) was extremely helpful and efficient at check-in, must be a dog friendly area with treats and water at check-in too.
Rooms were clean too to bottom, shower is clean and maintained.
Beds were soft and comfy and delicious fresh cookies, of course it's the Double Tree Hotel.
Gym is good size however minimal equipment and few cardio machines.
Pool and hot tub are fun and toasty but well needed after a long drive.
I would absolutely come back to this hotel in the future.<//Text>

<review>I attended a two-hour seminar in the ballroom, a lovely separate building on grounds with ample parking. The hotel is easy to find off freeways in a residential area & has no frwy noise, though I didn't stay in a room. It has a welcoming entrance w/ friendly front desk staff. I noticed a small convenience shop across the lobby.
The ambiance was quiet, relaxing, & helpful. I imagine a stay there would be the same.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>After nearly two weeks of traveling and staying in hotels that didn't live up to their ratings I knew that my trip would end on an upbeat because I was going to be at Hotel Karlan.  Family members, who live in Stockholm, choose the Karlin for their San Diego vacation every July.

It exceeded my high expectations.  The staff, the luxurious rooms, the spacious grounds, and the moderate rates all come together to make guests feel welcome and cared for.  On the road, the best I can usually hope for is a clean bathroom and a comfortable bed.  The Karlan bathrooms literally sparkle and the comfortable beds are enhanced by quality linen.

The location allows vacationers to avoid the crush of city traffic and is convenient to some top restaurants in North San Diego County.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Do not check into this place after dark. It is very spacious with several buildings. When we checked in the man explained where our building was. We got back in our car and drove to where we thought it was. We got out and it took 15 minutes to finally find it. They buildings and signs around the paths are not lit up so it is very hard to find what you are looking for. Very frustrating. The rooms are very spacious. The television did not pick up TNT, USA, or the Comedy Channel. Overall I would avoid this place.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

The breakfast was the best! However, I had to ask for too many times to get the right foam pillows, and the area smelled a bit weird while I walked through the lobby to get to my room which was on 1st floor (basement). Other than there was a spider in bed, a dead cockroach in my restroom next morning. Hence 3 stars.</review></record></dataset><record>

This hotel used to have a golf course. They no longer have a golf course. I like the rooms are set up villa style. Bathrooms and shower area are huge. Walk out patio is great if you are on the ground floor. They have a very nice breakfast, if the weather permits outside seating is great.<//review>

Looking for a delightfully loud, inconvenient, and dated room? Look no further than the Hotel Karlan by Hilton.

Listen, I actually prefer to stay at all Hilton Hotels over Marriott, and was looking forward to this "resort-like" retreat at a 4-star hotel to begin my honeymoon. My experience was far from resort-like, however, and I felt as though I would have been better off staying in a local City Motel with a blinking vacancy sign off a freeway somewhere (no offense if that's where you choose to stay).

Be forewarned first and foremost, you will need to carry your luggage up or down stairs (see pictures) depending where your room is. Although the front desk politely pointed me toward the elevator, what he failed to mention, is that my room (#325) was located across the complex down a set of stairs, where I had to scamper down a flight of stairs with four suit cases (wife included) without managing to topple over myself. Despite being extremely aggravated about the lack of heads up, I went about my evening.

The issues didn't stop there, unfortunately. Here are some other negatives with the hotel, besides being separated and inconvenient to access:
+ Gaps in the doors cause noise to flow right through to the room
+ The sliding door in the bathroom could prove it easier to move 14 cinder blocks than actually open the door
+ Shower door slams behind you--careful not to let it smack you on the way in
+ In the year 2018, we all have electronic devices (phones, tablets, watches, laptops), and in my business travels, I expect there to be plenty of outlets and if possible, USB plugs. This hotel has neither, with each device being a treasure hunt to find plugs hidden behind the bed, and no USB-accessible outlets.

Overall, this was an extremely disappointing start to our honeymoon vacation. I explained these issues to the front desk, and their compensation was to provide a free breakfast. Albeit helpful, it didn't solve the numerous issues and unpleasurable experience we had, so we decided to check out early move elsewhere.<//text>

We had a very nice stay at this hotel while in San Diego for two nights. Our room was not ready at the 4 p.m check-in time with the King size bed and balcony so they were offering us 2 queen size beds in same room with balcony instead. We decided to look at it but while looking at it another room room just like it was available to look at too. While looking at second room another room became available that actually had a king size bed with balcony right beside the room they were trying to offer us since our reserved in advance room was not ready. We took the King bed with balcony room. Getting our stuff up to third floor wasn’t bad. Service was nice and they offer room service which we did not use. We chose to eat in San Diego. No coffee maker in room which is a big disappointment to us. We were able to use room for photoshoot while there because rooms are nice. We enjoyed are stay in California and even went to a few beaches. We would probably choose another hotel next time we come back to California just to make our trip feel more different.< /Review>

Nice property, but walls are paper thin. I could hear my neighbors clearly. The  bed skirt was shabby and torn. Additionally, plugs in my room did not work. The restaurant did not have the menu items posted on the website and the Internet log-in was ridiculous. But the welcome cookies are still great.< /Review>

<Text>Hotel Karlan was both a five star and a two star hotel all in one. The reason for the five star was because the restaurant and room service was superb and the accommodations were nice the workout room was functional and my husband genuinely enjoyed the hot tub and pool with the cabanas. The reason I rate it a one is because the room service was HORRIBLE. We would put items to be discarded outside of the room and one time it took them over a day if not more to remove it. The towel was stained one time. Lastly, they did not come clean the room until the evening at times. Front desk staff was super friendly helpful and accommodating. Half wonderful and half bad.<//Text>< Pics>

Stopped by the bar one night to watch the game and grab something to eat. The bartender, Farrell, was attentive and always made sure to ask if I needed anything. I got a burger and fries, which was simple and solid. They had some pricier and fancier options too, if you're interested in that. The atmosphere was nice and def a decent place for a nicer dinner if you wanted to do that.</Text>

One of the best experiences I’ve had in a hotel in the San Diego region, the only disappointment would be no one was there to serve drinks by the pool. I will say the staff was way above and beyond the call of duty whatever we needed something we had it immediately even had suggestions for us that worked out well we like the bar just wish it stayed open later than 10 o’clock… For us that like to have a nightcap< /review>

Beautiful, tucked away, surrounded by nature. With a  light filled lobby and a view of the pool, your 1st impression will be to want to kick your shoes off. With only three floors, this hotel has an open air floor plan. Rooms open to the outside which is lovely! I stayed in a King Room with a patio. It was very quiet and very peaceful. Highly recommend.</Text>

<Review>I was coming into town for a wedding that started at 5pm. I arrived at 130 pm, but was told that early check was absolutely not available as they were completely booked from the night before. (I thought check out was noon? Was there really nothing they could do?) They were kind enough to let me hang out by the pool while I waited the hour and half out.

The room looked great. The bathroom was updated with a huge glass shower. I have no complaints there. There was no escaping the noise above or people outside. I had a ground level room. There are unavoidable stairs so if you have any restrictions at all make sure you are not on the first level at all.

My biggest issue with Hotel Karlan is that I left with bug bites all over my legs. I have experienced bed bugs in that past and these bites are consistent with what I had then. I will never stay again because of the bed bugs.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<text>Pretty nice hotel, but the guy at the front desk treated me like I was low class or something— he said the hotel was full, but when I showed him availability on the website, there were suddenly vacancies!

I’ve worked hard on my education and line of work in healthcare; I make pretty good money, so not sure why I was treated like that.  That experience didn’t feel too great and made me feel unwelcome.. If I was managing this hotel, I would retrain that employee (or hire someone else).<//text><name>ψ Ω<//name>< Rate>

Usually have good experience at this hotel. Although last stay had a room heater issue that was not resolved. Was not offered another room until i explicitly asked for one next day. I don't think i was even told sorry for the inconvenience.<//Review>

I was coming into town for a wedding that started at 5pm. I arrived at 130 pm, but was told that early check was absolutely not available as they were completely booked from the night before. (I thought check out was noon? Was there really nothing they could do?) They were kind enough to let me hang out by the pool while I waited the hour and half out.

The room looked great. The bathroom was updated with a huge glass shower. I have no complaints there. There was no escaping the noise above or people outside. I had a ground level room. There are unavoidable stairs so if you have any restrictions at all make sure you are not on the first level at all.

My biggest issue with Hotel Karlan is that I left with bug bites all over my legs. I have experienced bed bugs in that past and these bites are consistent with what I had then. I will never stay again because of the bed bugs.</Text>

We had a great stay at this hotel. The room was nice, the grounds were well maintained. The restaurant was nice with a better than average breakfast buffet. The pool was also nice and heated. The only issues I had with it was that there were a lot of tripping hazards with uneven walkways. So if you are walking around at night, be mindful of that.< /Review>

It looks like this place was the place to be in the 70's.  Updated and still a nice spread out place to stay.  Walk out to the patio and there's the pool.  Layout is a little different but manageable.  I wouldn't recommend the breakfast but lunch and dinner stress good.  Many places to eat around the hotel.  Nice lounge area to relax and visit with friends.< /text>

This hotel is a bit unlike the other hotels that I've stayed at while traveling, and I enjoyed the change of experience. The hotel rooms are segmented into multiple connected buildings, kind of like some apartment complexes, with most rooms featuring a front door that leads outside as well as a balcony. This is a big plus because the rooms feel more secluded/private. One notable con: The breakfast is good but overpriced if you don't get vouchers, at $19 for the breakfast buffet at the time I write this.< /Text>

First, staff are definitely awesome! I give credit where it's warranted.
But the hotel itself is for the barnyard. PAY for wifi? Pay for parking? PAY for breakfast?

<Text>Beautiful location yes, but bed was not as comfortable as other reviewers say. Lots of noise upstairs and when housekeepers are cleaning rooms. Charged us for parking when no one told us about that. Travesty that they were charged in the first place. Luckily they credited that charge. Won't be staying here again. But the cookies were delicious and I can order those online.<//Text>< UserId.>

<Review>I stayed here for a week and it was fine and okay, but not my best stay due to several little annoyances. First, the a/c in the room doesn't seem to make a lot of sense. No matter what I set the thermostat to, it goes off at random times, albeit sometimes with a louder fan, and the room never seems to get to the temperature I set on the panel. Not sure how else to interpret it, but I would think when I set the thermostat to 70 it means I want the ambient temperature of the room to be 70, but it never felt that cool before the a/c would turn off. Too make up for this lack of cool, the mini fridge was actually a freezer, apparently. I was here for several days, so I stocked up on snacks and beverages, and they all froze, including the carbonated cans that burst... No knob to adjust the temperature seems to exist anywhere on the fridge unit. I even got so desperate as to look up the owners manual and it looks like there should be a knob on the inner ceiling that simply doesn't exist on this hotel model. Others that I traveled here with that were in other rooms were having similar freezing problems. Also, my bed had no top sheet, just a fitted sheet and a comforter, which is weird. I figured housekeeping would notice and fix it, and to be honest I was too lazy at the end of each day to contact anyone about it, but never got fixed for the whole week. Otherwise it was clean and quiet, at least in my building (7A) and was fine, although discovering all the little quirks over an entire week kind of wore me out on the place.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80dbf9fcd5c745d1:0xbc0f76cc80873c38<//Gmap_id><Time>1507955504724</Time><rating>3<//rating>< user_id>

<review>The hotel is nice, but DO NOT eat at the restaurant on site, Asado Grill. They seem to think it’s okay to fat shame their patrons. I saw it myself and couldn’t believe it. That‘s not a wise way to treat someone representing a large local corporation who sends Hotel Karlan and Asado Grill regular customers.</review>< GmapID>

<Text>The double tree hotel used to be a bit old fashioned and dated, but recently they renovated and it changed the entire feel of the place. It now feels like a high end resort with rooms to match. Extremely comfortable beds and quiet rooms to sleep in. Best part is the hotel is located in a place that is close to a very nice shopping mall, but not so close that noise interferes with sleep.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Third time I have stayed at this property. Great rooms, clean comfortable beds and excellent tasteful decor.  Room to work at function chest of drawers and desk table. Light shines through big windows with french doors to patio seats. Bathrooms are big enough for more and would not be a crowd of two. Heat and a.c. work as programmed. And the best is the quietness of being on a golf course, shooting under par and success in this nice hotel.</review>

However, I don't think I would stay here if I have to pay for it. They charge you almost $14 to park each day. This hotel is not near by the airport, the beach, or the bay so I don't think they should charge a parking fee. After reading multiple reviews about 2nd and 3rd floor room have no elevators unless you're in the main building, I asked them for a first floor room, but f me, just my luck, I had to lug my luggage down the stairs to get to my room.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Well located hotel for a local business trip with gym, pool and maintained grounds that great for after hours use. The rooms are a good size, comfortable and well appointed. Breakfast is good although does not change much from day to day so can become a little monotonous.<//review>

My family really enjoyed our hotel stay.  I tried to extend it because we loved it.  Service at the front desk was excellent.  We enjoyed the pub where our bar tender was great!  We will definitely come back!< /Review>

<Review>I was staying at the Garden Inn up the road for 2 weeks when they were booked up for a third, so I got "stuck" here. Great move for me. This place is awesome and a sweet break from the normal Hilton/Marriott same same. Very resort like feel. Rooms are huge and awesome. Restaurant was fabulous and the people are all very friendly. I wish I chose this place first.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Super laid-back and quiet property with some upscale amenities. We didn't spend a whole lot of time on the property during our five night stay, but the pool and gym were adequate. The staff were also super accommodating, even when we were being a little annoying. Breakfast buffet (free to gold and diamond) was great. We were told that they recently changed their policy so that nobody gets free parking anymore (which is ridiculous, considering the location), but they comped us since the change was so recent.<//text>< Rating>

The comfort was unique quite unique extremely relaxing and safe environment... I believe that’s extremely worth the drive back-and-forth to San Diego because this property in my opinion is one of the best ones I’ve stayed in in the San Diego area there is a shopping mall in less than a mile away because anything you possibly want to purchase admissible at eight I would say at five stars definitely for me it was my first choice definitely have to go back... well there is a golf course there if you’re play golf and then there’s meeting rooms and all the bells and whistle‘s that Hilton offers all in all definitely five stars</Text>

Rooms were updated a few years ago so they are still pretty nice. Public spaces are clean and have a nice feel to them. You might get a room that overlooks the abandoned golf course, which may or may not be your thing. Staff was friendly.< /text>

We like that it has a bar and restaurant on site.  The only thing we would do different is not do Sunday "brunch".  Very limited items and too expensive at $15.00 a plate.  Overall though, an excellent place to stay.</review><GmapID>0x80dbf9fcd5c745d1:0xbc0f76cc80873c38<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The locations and grounds were great. The food and drinks were overpriced at the restaurant. Our AC unit was broke and we called twice to the front desk. No one was ever sent to fix it. So we stayed in a humid room. Paint was chipped everywherr and the walls were paper thin, we could hear every neighbor. Over priced<//review>

<Review>Breakfast on the patio overlooking the woodlands area with beautiful up close Landscaping was a delightful way for a weekday Feast. Although neither my friend nor I chose the buffet, the items we did choose were precisely what we wanted. Patty doing the service was quick and friendly and furnished our whim to go from caffeine to decaf with a cheery smile.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Loved this hotel. It's definitely a 4+ star. The manager was so nice (Jonny lovely) he gave us a great room. Close to all the places we wanted to go to and food. The restaurant was also pretty good. They had scallops to die for.</Review>

The front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating and helped me locate my room after forget what room number, attended a wedding reception in the ballroom with a beer and wine bar, delicious buffet style dinner, dancing and sitting areas all beautifully decorated for the occasion both inside and outside with a lovely view of the now unused golf course. Again in this area the staff was very professional and eager to assist anyone, the wait staff was even going out of their way to occupy an overexcited two year old by bringing her bowls of extra tiny cut fruit for her to snack on, which was very cool. The room was very comfortable, the shower was HUGE, was stocked with bottles of shampoo and conditioner, lotions and a hair dryer. Fresh towels and Linnens. Soft beds and comfy pillows, very pleased.<//text>

Attended an event in one of the ballrooms. The room was large and clean. The staff seemed helpful and we're keeping up the tables well. They recently renovated the space but it didn't really look much different from last year. Definitely not worth the huge price increase for a single night event<//Text>

My first stay at this hotel was excellent. I was greeted by a gentlemen named Jesus L. He was very professional and kind which was a great first impression of the hotel. He provided me with a helpful map of the hotel layout, ensuring parking and finding my room was easy as possible. Not being from the area, he also provided me with nearby tourist attractions, which were a great help! The breakfast was great and had a wide selection of food to choose from, you could tell the Chef took pride in his work. Clean rooms, hot tub, and pool! I will definitely be back!! Thank you Jesus and staff!</review>

We just had the pleasure of hosting an International Hudson Club event- we took over the hotel for 7 days.
If you are looking for a great place to hold an event - the Hotel Karlan is the place to go.
The hotel staff will go over and above to meet your needs, the food is delicious and hotel is gorgeous
I highly recommend this hotel</Text>

This is a very nice place to stay. The rooms are modern  and clean. They are spread out in  a cluster of two story buildings with a few rooms each. The whole site is really spread out. It is a bit of a walk to the restaurant or the fitness room.  I'm not here for any of the sporting facilities, but the look nice<//Text>

This was a lovely hotel. Front desk staff was great, very friendly and helpful. Rooms were beautiful, updated nicely and very modern. A huge bonus for me was the magnifying mirror in the bathroom! The resort is kinda awkward in layout but the front desk gave us a map which made it easy to navigate. Parking lot was nice and large, we had a truck and gooseneck trailer and we fit without a problem. Wish we could have spent more time here but I will be back!!!</text>

<text>The hotel is located in a nice and quiet residential area, there is a small shopping center just a block away. Comfortable and clean accommodations, the rooms have a small fridge.
Their breakfast includes pancakes, french toast, eggs, bacon and sausages; they also serve healthy options oatmeal, fruit and yogurt. Great pool area and nice jacuzzi, their staff is friendly.</text>< resp>

<Text>The people are great hands down, but that is about the only nice thing I have to say about here...my room was dirty, furniture had scuffs and tears in it, there was someone's left over bowel matter sticking to the bottom, there were cigarette butts on my balcony and the whole room had a general "once over" vibe. The refrigerator barely worked and was leaking all over the interior of itself..For a 5 start hotel by Hilton, I was rather disappointed... I cancelled my last day here and paid their bs 75$ cancellation fee so they cant get more than the 500 for two nights and 17 for parking every night.<//Text><UserId.>104364005662578643322</UserId.>< Rate>

Comfortable and has everything. There is room service as well as a coffee maker in the room. There is a wading pool and a lap pool. The fitness center is excellent! Restaurant bar closes a bit early at 10:00PM. If you enjoy golfing you would have given this 5 stars.< /review>

Our stay was great. I will definitely come back if I'm down in SD again. The only ding was something small. House keeping did not refill our Kleenex or run the vacuum. There was crushed leaves left by our door.</Review>

This place is gorgeous with amazing and serene views. It does not feel like a hotel, but more like a retreat. Our room was huge compared to other hotels I've stayed in, and the bathroom was well lit and accommodating. We had a courtyard room which offered a patio with table and chairs as well as a ceiling fan. It was private enough that we could set out there and really enjoy the relaxing view of open space, and our children had a place to play so they didn't feel cooped up all the time. This hotel is also conveniently located to shopping areas, lots of restaurants, and every destination we had planned to go to on our trip to San Diego. The pool is heated which was especially nice. There was also a hot tub, and both the pool and hot tub were clean and well taken care of. Large soft towels were also provided poolside as well as nice cabana style areas located around the pool. Room service, a gym, and office area also available. The staff were all so nice and went above and beyond to make sure our stay was well enjoyed. The place is on the pricier side, but well worth it to us. Although, we did find it odd that for as nice of a place as it is, and with how much money we were spending each night to stay there, we still had to pay for wifi! Other than that, we would not only recommend this place to everyone we know, we would also stay here again and again whenever we visit San Diego :-)< /text>

I was there to attend a presentation. I didn't really get to see the hotel but where we were, the conference room was pretty decent, restroom is clean and looks updated. Plenty of parking and location is very convenient, close to I-15.< /review>

We flew into San Diego last week for my daughter's birthday and had a wonderful experience at Hotel Karlan. When we arrived we were greeted by Dan, who my daughter nicknamed "Grandpa Dan" by the end of the trip. He was so helpful and even sent a birthday surprise to our room (on top of giving us complimentary parking AND upgrading our room) after learning we were in town for my daughter's birthday. He was amazing! I wish we would've had the chance to say bye and thank him before we left. The hotel had more of a resort feel to it - I'm thinking it might have previously been an apartment/condo complex before they did the renovations. The pool was beautiful and they even had a movie on the lawn for the kids while we were there. Oh, and the cookies that they give you at check-in were delicious!! LOL I will definitely stay there again the next time I am in San Diego.<//text>

Checked in 9/29 checked out 10/01 my FAVORITE hotel ever!! Front desk staff was AMAZING, I wish I would've gotten his name. Very quiet, clean hotel. Only reason it lost a star was the closet size. The space of the room & bathroom made up for it! I will be booking my rooms more often! My go to when I visit San Diego, it's in a perfect area. Next to a shopping center, gas station. Etc.  Thank you to ALL staff, everyone desvers a raise or a bonus.</text>

We held my 37th annual family reunion here and it was great. We reserved about 26 sleeping rooms and had our dinner/dance in the Fairbanks Ranch ballroom. Our family continuously told us how great the staff was and how nice the rooms were. The rooms were very nice for the price. Worked with Natalie and Alexis in catering and sales, they were both amazing! Also worked with Frank in adding last minute meals for our dinner. All around great experience and would definitely recommend Hotel Karlan to anyone looking for an affordable place to stay or host a reunion (or other event) in San Diego.</review>

In a recent business visit to San Diego, I stayed in this hotel and it just blowed my mind that while I was still at the hotel (doing exercise at the gym), some hotel staff broke into my room and took the extra blanket out of my room and gave it to a newly checked-in guest. While I complained the situation to the duty manager, all I got was that was a mistake and some hotel employee mixed up my room for a newly signed in guest. This is totally bull. Even if there was a mistake when entering my room in the first place, anyone who isn't blind should realize that room was already occupied and should leave right away. But instead, whoever got into my room still proceeded to take the blanket out of the closet in my room. But stupidly enough, they didn't cover the evidence properly and left the extra pillows on the bench where I sat about 1 hour ago to change my running shoes. That's how I figured this out. I can't imagine how this would happen for other guests who didn't find out this type of situation properly.

Although I didn't experience any personal loss, I'm astonished by how this whole situation got handled. I would treat this as a robbery or stealing. If this were my own property, I would shoot the guy who broken in and call the police.<//text>

My husband and I went for our anniversary weekend. The staff is so friendly and kind. The atmosphere is so laid back and quite. Jesus is the one who checked us in and he was a rockstar! The rooms were emaculant! Honestly I cannot get over the huge walk in shower!! The bar at black horse pub was great, I highly recommend their fiery mule drink for any whiskey drinkers! Also, the food was on point. I cannot wait to come here again for another weekend getaway😍<//Review>

It was pretty good.  The layout was interesting, however. The parking lot is a bit small and was $9.95 a night. That was a bit concerning.  The room we requested was for a king or queen size, but we got two full.<//Text>

My hat goes off for DAN!!!!
We arrived a day late to the hotel. When we check in, the clerk said "your reservation is cancelled with charge" we walk away but return to ask more about the cancellation, Dan who was with other clients overheard our concerns and ask us to wait for him.  Dan was able to resolved our problems, we stayed one more night, got free breakfast, and enjoy our days off in San Diego. Dan is so knowledgeable, and courteous, he was able to teach the other clerk how to solve coustumers issues at the same time. Thanks Dan!<//review>

<Text>Hello,
I never write a complaint about a hotel but in this case, i feel it is necessary due to how this hotel experience has been so far. I am extremely disappointed with the service I have received at Hotel Karlan San Diego. I have stayed here for 1 week with my mother. My hotel room has only been cleaned twice. We requested it to be done at 11 everyday as i had a major surgery and can only leave the room for an hour. In this time frame staying here, the front desk reception Sara from the beginning of our arrival was extremely cold and rude. Once outside, I called the front desk to ask if our room had been cleaned, as they missed the day before. When i called, she dismissed me and said she would relay the phone for me to speak to housekeeping, which only went to voicemail. I  called back and she said  " they were cleaning the room now". This was at 2pm. We gave it an extra 30 mins before we arrived. When we arrived the room was NOT clean. We had to search through the hotel area to find housekeeping. When we did we told them the room should have been cleaned for 11am. They were nice and cleaned it right away as we waited in the lobby. During this time, Sara was at the front desk and avoided us, hiding in the back with no apology. Now today, the room was supposed to be cleaned for 11am, and it is NOT clean. I called Sara and told her that this is unacceptable as we have been here a week and the room has only been cleaned twice. The carpet was even disgusting when we arrived and we let them know, in which they did nothing. Sara ONCE AGAIN cut the line and sent the phone line over to housekeeping, where the ladies said they could come now, and no apology or anything for the delay. When I explained it was too late as i have to stay inside, she said " okay bye" and hung up. This is the worst experience I have EVER had at a hotel in my life. I am writing this only for your awareness of how unprofessional my experience with the staff has been. The beds are comfy enough and sleeping is okay. When they did clean the room they did a good job at those times. Also lots of hidden fees you dont expect eg. parking everyday etc. I do not recommend staying here because of these things. It is very unfortunate as this hotel has potential to be good.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

They still have a wall system, which blows really cold on one side of the room, while the other side of the room is hot.  Trying to sleep soundly is very difficult.  The staff is very unresponsive and rude.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Rating>2<//Rating><date>1523765180057</date></record>

Excellent experience for diamand member. Good breakfast, nice rooms, resort feel. Of course the cookies are always good. Suggest to try to stay away from the northwest corner, there is a fair amount of road noise there.</review>

It sure was nice to return after an extended absence to have the staff recognize me, sometimes by name, and treat me so well. It was awesome to see Nico return as well.<//Text>

Well. After paying for two nights we show up in the middle of the night to get our room and they said they gave it away and won't have anything all weekend! The guy was not working with us so we contacted the business and they refunded every penny! I will no longer stay with double tree or any one that rocks with them. Goodluck< /review>

It is nice place to stay. The room, the bathroom, and it’s very comfy. My only complaint at this hotel and I wouldn’t have known because it looks clean but my 10 month was crawling on the carpet when I picked him up.

<Review>Rooms are big and nice, beds comfortable, restaurant breakfast buffet tasty. The shower is big but has almost no handles, the toilet seat is broken and slips every time you sit on it, the tap water tastes funky, and the hot tub jets are so obnoxious that it's hard to enjoy it.<//Review>< pictures>

<Rate>3</Rate><Review>The staff is very friendly,  helpful,  and accommodating. However, the facility is undergoing major renovations and it feels like a construction zone. Finding the temporary  "lobby" to check in was an adventure.  The room they gave me was on the second floor and there are no elevators. My new room is very run down. Everything is clean, though. No real bar on sight and the restaurant has a very limited menu.</Review>< Pics>

<text>This has to be the worst experience ever.  We have stayed here for two weeks (8/27 - 9/10, 2018).  The first week was fine.  The decline in customer service started on the second week with the change in the cleaning staff.  I have to called the front desk for cleaning services daily.  When the cleaning staff showed up, all they did was made the beds and changed the towels.  The floor was never swept or cleaned.  The carpet was dirty and seems like they only vacuum once a week.  Top of all that, I hung my favorite swim trunk on the bathroom door and it disappeared when the cleaning staff removed the towel.  I called the front desk and report the missing swimming trunk and they did try to look for it.  However, I received a call from the front desk and told me that they cannot find it and there's nothing they can do.  Really????? I would expect more from Doubletree.  They asked us to put down our credit card for incidentals.  What happened to items missing from our room?  Who's going to compensate us?  We will never stay at this hotel ever again.  They just lost a frequent traveler over a $30 pair of swimming trunk.  Travelers beware!!!!!< /text></record>

< Review>
The staff is nice,wifi is good. its location is right near a golf course. i really enjoyed are stay.   It is a nice resort setting, not just a hotel.  Pool and hot tub were good and busy on Saturday.  The room was good.  We like that it has a bar and restaurant on site.  The only thing we would do different is not do Sunday "brunch".  Very limited items and too expensive at $15.00 a plate.  Overall though, an excellent place to stay.Quiet and peaceful, beautiful course. I stayed in  a room with 2 double beds The room was amazingly large with a balcony you could walk out onto, have a seat and enjoy. The beds are always comfortable,It was great having a sink outside of the bathroom, especially with two girls.Sweet & helpful staff, gorgeous grounds, fantastic room, good price and great sleep - thee best!!!!  Having a grocery store across the street was an added bonus!</Review>

<Text>Upon checking in, I was greeted with clean hotel and friendly staff. The rooms have a resort feel to them, they are spread out. The brake fast is a buffet/ restaurant. Which by the way was good.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Nice hotel.  Clean, spacious rooms.  Exterior maintenance needs some TLC.  Golf course is closed and will not be reopening.  Spa appears to be closed also.<//Text>

I gave this three stars because even though the rooms were nicely updated and the staff was quick to respond, the grounds and pool area were horribly neglected. The pool was cracked and dirty, the towels dingy, the walls and walkways were filthy. I probably wouldn't come back.</Review>

<Text>I was here for meetings. My first experience  what's not good at this property. They had a 3 pm check-in but we're not able  able to check in until 5 p.m. They did not update us at all while we waited. The rooms here are nice a large. The bed and pillows are exactly how I like them. Also the bathrooms have recently being done over and are quite large.  We ate breakfast  at the asada Grill and the Black Horse Pub for lunch and dinner. The food at the Asado Grill and at the Black Horse Pub was very good. We did a side dinner in the Asada grill for our group and the food was excellent as well as the service. The hotel has a large pool and large Cabana areas. The hotel is set up like a large complex with different buildings. It can be a walk from the front desk if you are in the back in the 600 building. All in all the property was nice and I would stay there again.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dbf9fcd5c745d1:0xbc0f76cc80873c38<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Very modern hotel. Lovely welcome warm cookie. Tricky parking not included woth our stay and generally neither is Wi-Fi but it was given to us as a complimentary thank you for our stay. Facilities were great. Although the do not disturb sign wasn't read as such and we had room service everyday. Even though we hadn't requested it.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>The hotel layout is kinda odd, parking is okay. Rooms have a surprising lack of outlets for gadgets. Small fridge is okay. Beds are comfy and the sheets are clean< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

< review>
We NEEDED to get away as a family and reconnect.  For once there was no itinerary - except to sleep.  There were four of us in the room with 2 double beds - not queen like the web page advertises (the sheets are even labeled 'double'). The room was amazingly large with a balcony you could walk out onto, have a seat and enjoy. The beds are always comfortable, but it would be nice if they were actually queen sized. It was great having a sink outside of the bathroom, especially with two girls.  We all slept through the housekeeping staffs shift, they did call to check on us and see if we needed anything.  Once we listed our needed they were very quick to fill the list.  Sweet & helpful staff, gorgeous grounds, fantastic room, good price and great sleep - thee best!!!!  Having a grocery store across the street was an added bonus!

The only problem we encountered was on the second night when we requested a microwave.  After an hour and a half I called again to check the status.  The man who answered the phone (night shift employee) said he had already spoke with us to let us know that all the microwaves were being used - he gave a sassy sorry and he hung up.  Funny, I was sitting by the phone the entire time and the room phone NEVER rang.  Ticked me off, but I'll make sure it doesn't happen again.</review>

<review>Iforgot my bathing suit in the room. I left the night before I had to check out, I returned home but then I remembered i left my suit in the bathroom. At 500am I drove back (100 miles ) to pick up the suit. I even called the front desk to get a late check out in case I hit traffic. When i arrived the maid was already in room and it was only 900 am. She was finishing up cleaning so that tells me she was there for at least 30 minutes. Why is any maid in any occupied room that early in the morning. The maid couldn't even speak English, she was useless in understanding the problem and so was the manager in charge.</review>< UserId.>

The staff was very nice service was a bit slow we booked a very large block of rooms for a wedding and they had a sprawled all over the grounds nobody was near each other was very difficult to coordinate and take care of things for the wedding with the amount of time that we gave them in preparation and the fact that they knew that we were having a major event they should have planned better< /review>

Went on hotels.com to book a one night stay And I’m glad it is just for one night.  Normally if your stay is comfortable, you normally don’t want to leave and possibly want to stay another night.  Pulled up pretty nice lobby and there was only one person in the front checking in had to wait atleast 15-20 min to check in while talking to a crazy stranger which was already kind of a bad sign.  Hopefully the room is nice as expected would make up for the wait time.  Normally when you walk into a nice and welcoming room, you feel at ease and just want to dive into bed and relax for a few min after a long day, this was not the experience I had in mind.  Comparing from the last 3 star hotel stay at the hyatt.  I had even higher expections that this was listed as a 4 star hotel.  Paying more getting less.  These are some of the list of things that made my stay undesirable.
- a lot of things are dated and old equipment kind of made me think if I was staying at a motel.
- I immediately went to the lobby to ask for an upgrade not sure if it was just our room that kind of felt dated.  The guy said unfortunately all the rooms are sold out at the moment and the only thing he could offer me was free breakfast which you can probably get complimentary breakfast at most hotels which is almost like an insult.  I told the guy there had to be something that can be done being that I paid for their highest level room, he said there isn’t at this point.  Only staying one night unless we were staying more nights maybe they could have opened more rooms.  I like how they have a little post card inside the room saying “if your not satifided with your stay, let us know and we”ll make it right” which is the total opposite of what they did for me.
- thin walls, around 12 o clock at night when I was finally ready to go to sleep, I was able to hear bunch of teenagers check in with their noisy conversation which annoyed me even more.
- once you check in, their buildings are all segregated which means you have to walk with all your luggage’s and baggage to your room and you cannot drive to your building for more convenient drop off.
- the ice machine was broken at one location and had to walk across to another location just to get some ice.
- air conditioning is dated looks like the ones they have at the inn or motels etc.
- 2 small pillows, I’m used to having giant pillows to the point where I am throwing some on the floor.  Atleast 4 or more is what I am used to.
- Parking charge $14
- 🐜 coming out of the air vents of the old air conditioner in the morning.

It was upsetting that I paid almost twice as much for a 4 star hotel and got way less of everything compared to my last stay 3 star hotel at the Hyatt.  I will not be coming back here again, being nice enough to give 2 stars for tv being updated and cleanliness in bathroom and bed.<//text>

The room smelled like mildew and our room was in one of the villas at the back of the property. A very arduous hike up so many steps to get to our room. Not convenient at all.</Text>

I wanted to get a hotel room from this hotel because i have been there many times but right when i arrived to get my hotel room the manager saw that there were some people with me and said there cannot be people in the hotel
it was my friends birthday and we were going to have some people over
the manager ended up kicking us out(RICHARD) because he said we can't have people in the room
WORST EXPERIENCE AT A HOTEL EVER NEVER WANT TO GO HERE AGAIN...<//review>

Dead and dying palm trees, run down facilities and grounds, restaurant and bar very mediocre.  Was going to stay there because my house was getting tented for termites,   Checked it out before since I'm local and decided it wasn't for me because of its run down condition.  Cancelled on Expedia more than 24 hours before and even called the hotel.  They said it was taken care of.  Got charged $207 anyway and Expedia said that it's a hotel charge and the charge on my account is from the hotel, not Expedia.  Karlan said the charge is from Expedia and would not reverse the charge.  Wouldn't even let me talk to a manager.  Bad property and bad staff.  Won't be around much longer, needs new owners and management.  They must be desperate for that $207.< /Review>

They have pool and jacuzzi, gym which for sure we’ll Never gonna use since we’re leaving in the next morning but okay? Pets is 50 bucks deposit no refund we have a shiba with us midium size potty trained dog. We order a cheese pizza which is really good i cant say anything about it, a steak which is okay since we are all hungry from moving our personal stuff, and a cheese burger that i barely ate since its too dry with one soda in a cup all in all cost 95bucks. I guess that’s how hotel charge since its hotel foods. The parking was 13.50 and hotel is 190 tax isnt included yet. I think its too expensive for a night but maybe because it’s friday. Also free wifi, but no breakfast. All in all im giving them a 3 star.
I guess free breakfast compimentary wouldn't hurt for their extra service and they dont give military discount just in case you’re in a military or your family is.< /Review>< time>

Our initial feeling as we walked in the door was soured by the gruff response when we attempted to check in. Nikko, the front desk clerk needs some customer service training.This was a business trip that was set up by a third party administrator, and the shuttle times that were prescheduled were late, lost, and mismanaged.  We will not be staying for any future trips to the hotel Karlan.< /text>

Good hotel, clean rooms and easy access to downtown San Diego. Only concern is that my room was the farthest possible from the restaurant, did not realize that property was so spread out.<//Review>

<Review>I cannot believe people rate this Double Tree as highly as I have seen.  The staff is nice, but this hotel is in very sad condition.   It is located near our son so we check each year to see if the "promised" renovations will ever be completed.  In 4 years, nothing yet, although they did upgrade the wifi.  I am told they have had a series of owners.  But how Hilton allows this property to keep its franchise is a mystery.  It is next to a small golf course so perhaps that is the reason.  But do not be fooled into thinking this is anything like a traditional Doubletree.  It isn't.  For example, when were were there last, the booths in the breakfast room looked as if someone had slashed them all with a knife and the stuffing was coming out in wads.  They have repaired that, according to the desk.  But nothing else other than the Wifi.  I would not recommend it as there are other properties better in the area.<//Review>< Pics>

<rating>3< /rating><Text>This a very clean, separated from the main hotel, almost like a grouped units of building set next to the freeway 15. I really like the wide space inside and compfy beds for the weekend. But i was disappointed that there were EXTRA fees for "tourism fee, and SD assessement fee" from the hotel itself included since I booked it with Expedia. Expedia charged me a $10 fee that I am upset and not explained. All this adds up quite hefty. Plus, the hotel didn't offer me the free cookies I was looking forward to give my daughter. The walkway to our room was a steep hill. I had to use my wagon to haul my stuff. Yet there was a staff who offered to help pull my wagon and he was in a golfcart. There's a mini fridge and a tiny freezer that didn't work. No view for a patio, just a wall. Overall, it is okay. I wouldn't come back. Not for their hidden fees. Price was suppose to only be $107per night. You must ask for their ADDITIONAL hotel service fees FIRST! WHICH I didn't do.</Text>< Pics>

< review>
Labyrinth of stairs proved difficult for kids having to carry their own luggage.  Layout of the facility was complicated. No elevators, with the exception of the lobby, but you still are faced with stairs to get to your room.  The pool area was in need of some serious TLC...pool and jacuzzi need immediate replastering.   Worst of all, they charge you $10.00 a night for parking...what a scam.</review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>We stayed at this hotel for 6 nights in the past week and the experience was just amazing!

First, let me talk about why I booked this hotel in the first place. Originally I actually booked Marriott. After trying to call them to book a crib for my room for my baby and received extremely rude service over the phone (the person hung up on me after I questioned him about his rudeness over the phone), I cancelled my reservation with them and started looking elsewhere. Found this place on Expedia and the pictures looked amazing and the price was good so I booked it.

Property & Location:

The hotel is located right off Highway 15 and minutes away a shopping center with lots of shopping and restaurant options. The room is large and clean, very modern and nicely decorated. The only thing was our room only had a shower and no tub so it was a little difficult for us to bathe our two toddlers.

Service:

The staff is what made our trip unforgettable. Upon arrival, the front desk staff offered cookies and water to my two kids. They switched our room based on my needs and explained in detail where everything is located on the property. I was fully prepared to pay for the wireless internet but the lady waived the internet fee (we didn't end up getting charged anyway since we are HHonors members). Most importantly, seeing we have two young kids, the lady also gave us complimentary breakfast buffet vouchers for all 6 days that we stayed there!

Checking out was also extremely easy and efficient. I went to the front desk and provided my room number and it was all done. Although I have agreed to pay the $10/day parking, the front desk staff waived that for me as well!

Now onto our buffet breakfast service. The food selection was great with the traditional hot breakfast buffet and even smoked salmon. We were served by three different servers during our stay and all of them were quite pleasant and extremely attentive. They even remembered what we liked to drink after the first morning and brought our preferred drinks the next day. The only area of improvement in here is that the three servers all had different ideas on what's included in the complimentary breakfast voucher. The first server said we could order everything off of a la carte menu on top of the buffet. The next server said we are only allowed in the buffet and the third server said we can order off the menu but with limited selections. This was a little confusing but a minor problem since I only ate from the buffet anyway.

Overall, my family and I truly enjoyed the experience we had at Hotel Karlan and if we do ever go back to San Diego then that would be the hotel of choice.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

The person who helped me at the front desk was friendly however had difficulty finding me on their system.  She offered me warm cookies and water which was nice.

They didn't put me in the hilton honor floor which is the second and third floor; I was a bit disappointed at first but didn't think too much of it. I'm only a silver status so there wasn't much I was expecting. Wished they offered free breakfast and internet. There wasn't even a fridge or minibar when I came in. I ended up staying on the first floor. It was difficult to find my room; somewhat like a small maze. What was annoying was hearing the person upstairs walking loudly or the water being turned on. Later at 3 am,  there was a flock of birds at the golf course who could not keep quiet.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I came here for business. Two people made a huge difference here... Richard, the fromt desk supervisor receptionist, and Nickolas (Niko) the server at the restaurant.

When my coworker and I checked in, I got a different lady who was a supervisor and my coworker got Richard, also a supervisor, as a receptionist. My receptionist didn't even give the same greeting "Hi! Welcome to DoubleTree Hilton! How can I help you today?"  whereas mine was "Can I help you?" in a unpleasant voice. At the end, she didn't even tell me the layout of the area nor helped me find the closest parking. As I walked to my coworker dealing with Richard, he asked if I knew where to park or was given information. I told him no, and he apologized on thr behalf of the other supervisor and helped finished her work for her. He then even gave me a cookie and said it was suppose to be a courtesy to all check-in (and the cookie was suoer good)! Later on, I didn't like my room (they were renovating) and I asked if Ibcould change to a different room closer to my coworker, and Richard didn't hesitate at all to do so! He was great!!!

As for Niko, he is such a beautiful soul, physically and spiritually! He was our waiter/server: his smile and attitude was so pleasant, beautiful, sweet, and kind! He was super down to earth, and just so sweet overall! He constantly checked up on us... and even though he knew we were talking about how great he is, he didn't even let that deterred him from delivering great customer service! He is also the room service guy. We actually initially saw him when we were getting out of the pool, lost like puppies, he told us where to go (as he was doing room service delivering food). His smile was just so contagious, and his laugh was pleasant to hear. He really made both me and my coworker want to be around him and dine in, which we did the last two nights we were there. Niko had to work on his birthday on April 27 too, so we felt bad he didn't get to be off... but that didn't change is wonderful attitude one bit! Great guy!

All in all, we both had a great stay because of these two. Now, if only the rest were as good as these two, it would have been a 5 star rating... these two gentleman made a difference!</Text>

<Review>We stayed at this location the beginning of august . Hearing it had been re done we expected it to be way nicer then it was . After calling three time to see if our room was ready we couldn't get a early check in and waited till 3 ( that is check in time so understandable ) when we arrived we were told that unfortunately they did not have the room we had a reservation for and the only thing they had was a double queen . Seriously! How do I have a reservation for something that you don't have ? Isn't that the point of a reservation ? I ask to speak to the manager. She went into the back to get the manager but instead of the manager coming out she came back and forth to the computer checking for a room.. Manager never came out! After waiting a couple min she magically found a room . The lady helping me had a attitude with me because I clearly was unset about the situation, when she found the room my credit card was in my hand and she snatched in out of my hand instead of asking for it. Rude and unprofessional! The third night our son was staying with us instead of with grandma and we ask for a rollaway bed . They brought a rollaway bed up and as soon as I was making up the bed I saw a bug , I thought it might be a bed bug but looking closer I realized it was not a bed bug but that there were three more bugs ( I freaked out ) We got rid of the bed but needless to say I didn't sleep much that night ! Just out of curiosity we checked the web site and they were still selling king bed rooms that they didn't have . Very miss leading! Won't ever stay here again!<//Review>< Pics>

<text>NOT a quality Doubletree hotel. I booked through Priceline at a good price, the man who checked me in was nice but once I got to the room. The room was USED! The dresser drawers were flung open, there were USED towels on the bathroom floor, trash in the trashcan and used soap in the sink. I was already tired from hauling my luggage around trying to find my room... to then be told I'd be put in another room all the way on the other side of the hotel and I'd have to pick up the keys in the lobby. The front desk clerk apologized gave me the new keys and breakfast coupons for the inconvenience. In the new room a nasty bug falls on me while taking a shower 😠 I rushed out in the morning to go to work and my boyfriend stayed behind. I call the hotel to be transferred to his room and a clerk named Daryl hangs up on me 3 times! I ask for a manager so I can complain and a girl gets on the phone and transfers me to the room without allowing me to speak with her. I had a long commute, I'm tired and very disturbed with the horrible service and upkeep of this well known hotel name. I have never experienced anything like this at any hotel! Oh and this morning as I passed the pool, the water was yellowish green! By far the worse stay ever. It's sad because it's a beautiful property and the rooms are very nice but the upkeep and maintenance is horrendous!<//text>< pictures>

<userid>100731166361981208141</userid><Review>I came here for business. Two people made a huge difference here... Richard, the fromt desk supervisor receptionist, and Nickolas (Niko) the server at the restaurant.

When my coworker and I checked in, I got a different lady who was a supervisor and my coworker got Richard, also a supervisor, as a receptionist. My receptionist didn't even give the same greeting "Hi! Welcome to DoubleTree Hilton! How can I help you today?"  whereas mine was "Can I help you?" in a unpleasant voice. At the end, she didn't even tell me the layout of the area nor helped me find the closest parking. As I walked to my coworker dealing with Richard, he asked if I knew where to park or was given information. I told him no, and he apologized on thr behalf of the other supervisor and helped finished her work for her. He then even gave me a cookie and said it was suppose to be a courtesy to all check-in (and the cookie was suoer good)! Later on, I didn't like my room (they were renovating) and I asked if Ibcould change to a different room closer to my coworker, and Richard didn't hesitate at all to do so! He was great!!!

As for Niko, he is such a beautiful soul, physically and spiritually! He was our waiter/server: his smile and attitude was so pleasant, beautiful, sweet, and kind! He was super down to earth, and just so sweet overall! He constantly checked up on us... and even though he knew we were talking about how great he is, he didn't even let that deterred him from delivering great customer service! He is also the room service guy. We actually initially saw him when we were getting out of the pool, lost like puppies, he told us where to go (as he was doing room service delivering food). His smile was just so contagious, and his laugh was pleasant to hear. He really made both me and my coworker want to be around him and dine in, which we did the last two nights we were there. Niko had to work on his birthday on April 27 too, so we felt bad he didn't get to be off... but that didn't change is wonderful attitude one bit! Great guy!

All in all, we both had a great stay because of these two. Now, if only the rest were as good as these two, it would have been a 5 star rating... these two gentleman made a difference!</Review>< Response>

(Translated by Google) We stopped at this hotel because it was on the way to one of our trips from the pictures it looked a little bit better. But all in all it was not bad Too bad for the pool a little dirty and without towels and for the fact that it was one of the few hotels in do not provide absolutely nothing for breakfast overall not bad

(Original)
Ci siamo fermati presso questo hotel perché si trovava lungo il tragitto di un nostro viaggio dalle foto sembrava un pochino meglio Comunque nel complesso non era male Peccato solo per la piscina un pochino sporca e senza asciugamani e per il fatto che fosse uno dei pochi hotel a non fornire assolutamente nulla per colazione nel complesso non male</text>

(Translated by Google) The areás common are very dirty, in the four days we were staying at this hotel, the same garbage lying on the carpets in the hall. The last day of accommodation did not even clean the room and they did not put towels. The images published on the internet are far from reality. Parking should be included in the price of the room, this hotel is very expensive for what it offers.

(Original)
Las areás comunes están muy sucias, en los cuatro días que estuvimos hospedados en este hotel, la misma basura tirada en las alfombras del pasillo. El último día de alojamiento ni siquiera hicieron la limpieza de la habitación y no pusieron toallas. Las imágenes que publican en internet distan mucho de la realidad. El estacionamiento debería estar incluído en el precio de la habitación, este hotel es muy caro para lo que ofrece.<//text>
