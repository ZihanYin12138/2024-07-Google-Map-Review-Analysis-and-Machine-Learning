If you are looking to enjoy yourself with a great atmosphere and delicious food, The Cove is the place to visit! First let's talk about the food: the portions are on the larger size and the taste, WOW. We got the lamb tenderloins appetizer and it immediately became a favorite! The rosemary sauce that came with the dish was so good I had to save it to eat it with my main dish. All the staff is incredibly nice an attentive too. No complaints at all. The bathroom and the entire place over all is super clean. We watched a live band known as "Those Guys," I seriously think they will blow up and become really famous soon. If you are in Murrieta, California you have to stop by The Cove!<//text>

< Review>
As the world is re-emerging, many companies will struggle a bit with having their institutions conform to transitioning rules. The Cove is a great place for entertainment and food, however they are slightly behind the curve with hiring enough staff to keep maintain a 5 star rating in customer service. Staff is great, there's simply not enough of them.</Review>

Soroush at the cove so he took over for our waitresses, who I guess was overwhelmed and or end of her shift. He was great explained how they are separating the oj from the champagne.  He was much more attentive and talked to us about the specials. We will be back especially if he is there. This is continued from previous experience. We went in for mimosas and brunch on a Sunday. *****5 stars for Soroush! The eggs Benedict had a bit too much lettuce maybe put spinach or fresh basil. The lamb chops amazing again. My lil guy had the icecream Sunday.  We all had a delicious meal!!< /text>

Came w my best friend Berta and come to find out the Cove has new staff who are amazing friendly and the service is outstanding.  Dan the new manager came to greet us and even gave us a new fresh order of chicken tacos cause mine had gotten cold.  I recommend this place to all my friends and none friends. They have authentic tacos. Come check it out.  Its worth it.</Review>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Stopped in today for the first time in a couple years (we have moved out of the area).  Awesome!!!!  Food was great (Asian salad, and The Cove burger), both cooked perfectly and tasted awesome.  The drinks were poured well (strong enough to enjoy, but not so strong we were unsafe leaving).  Our bartender, Kelsey (I think?!?  Horrible with names- thin, fit, long dark hair, cute, tattoos,  knew all the regulars) was on point!  Excellent balance of knowing all the regulars, communicating with the other staff, greeting folks as they entered, and making the non-regulars feel welcome and at home. The regulars were friendly and chatty, but none were obnoxious (several were attending a funeral for a local well known coach, considering the emotions involved that speaks well to the type of crowd the place draws).  Overall, we absolutely will be back!  I just wish we still lived in the area to make it by more often.<//Text><GmapID>0x80dc83ebe7de70b1:0xe1a7774c5f58f1a3</GmapID>< Pics>

Came to The Cove after church so we could watch the Packers play,  eat and have a drink.  I love this place.  They had the game on the giant screen there were tons of Packer fans.  The brunch until 2pm was amazing.  My wife loved the $20 bottomless mimosas. This is definitely a repeat.  In fact we'll be back this Sunday after church for the Packers vs Bears game.</Text>

Came here with a friend a couple of weeks back for Karaoke night on Thurs. The chairs were really uncomfortable and service from our waiter was not good. We saw him sweeping the floors and then immediately handle our drinks.... he didn’t wash his hands. I didn’t touch my drink and didn’t stay long.</review>

Best pizza!! My family's favorite pizza place to order from. The crust and sauce is on point. Favorites to order combination, pepporoni, mushroom and olives and of course hawaiian. The pastrami sandwiches are a must try as well.< /Review>

Ok so I dont ever leave reviews but this pizza was well worth the money. Their extra cheese is EXTRA CHEESE and I could taste the freshness of all the ingredients. Superb!! I was reading other reviews and about their phone line. They have the old school setup and have to be off the phone line to run card transactions. Pretty sure that's what's up with that situation.</review>

The pizza deserves 5 stars but there has been multiple times I have called and didn't get an answer. There should be no reason why that happens unless you're calling outside of business hours. Pretty upsetting being that I have enjoyed this pizza ever since I can remember. Appreciate the business you guys get!< /review>

The pizza is so good! I wish I knew about this place a long time ago.

4/5 stars because I wouldn’t eat there(like eat inside) really hot inside there’s icecream but I’m afraid it’s been melted because it’s so hot in there and not appealing, only metal tables and chairs.That’s it.

All in all that won’t stop me from coming back! I recommend trying this pizza! It’s so delicious! Defiantly gonna try a lot more things on the menu<//text>

The Licoln location is my favorite dispensary.  They are reliable, knowledgeable and almost always have exactly what I'm looking for.  Delivery option is fantastic when you're working from home or too busy to pick up. 😊< /review>

Refused entrances because CA ID was expired, not due to age. This does not make sense as this entire point of this is to verify age and identity, not legal driving licensing. Very poor policy. Will not be returning again. Do not recommend.<//text>

Came in about one week ago, awesome dude named Corey really helped me out. I had many questions and needed guidance for product selection and he went above and beyond to answer and help me out. Excellent experience and most definitely will be returning. His recommendations were on point and I am happy with my selections.  Thanks a lot Corey & MedMen. 👊🏻👍🏻</Text>

One of those places that has left a lasting, good memory in my heart. Everyone in store was super friendly and helpful! Loads of choices at different prices. I'm so happy I came here, one of the girls, London, just bought my car and helped me out in so many ways. If I'm ever in America again i am coming back here!!</Review>

Even the door guards are alert and friendly! I already have a favorite saleslady. She helps me find the best product for my inflammation issues. She explains what the difference between the variety of products. Excellent customer service from saleslady London and other trained and informed staff.</text>

<Review>Really great selection which is this places best quality. The Apple store feel can be a bit much, I prefer the shops that feel more local and slower paced. Prices are comparable, though I have encountered more deals and brand promotions at other dispensaries. Staff is knowledgeable and provides good recommendations, but know your budget because nothing is cheap.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

My fiancé and I are new to California and recently moved to Venice. We have been to MedMen about four times and each time Bart has helped us. We would not go anywhere else. He is so knowledgeable, helpful and takes his time explaining the products. We are closer to the store on Abbot Kinney, but only go to this location because of Bart. He takes great pride in what he does and is truly helping people. Angie<//Text>

This location is always a pleasure to visit. The staff is always very helpful and enthusiastic regardless of what I'm shopping for and the products are top notch. My only complaint is that they don't get enough super silver haze flower as it regularly sells out- but that's ok, plenty of other options to choose from.</review>

<Review>If you must go to MedMen try the Abbot Kinney location (although there is no parking) ,NOT this one.
There are only a couple floor people here that are knowledgeable, but for the most part they are winging it. Besides pushing the product they want to dump (for good reason) , the main reason is the attitude from the front door. Couldnt beleive it. I wont go into all the details, but I'll just say, that people who smoke pot are normally passive chilled folks, maybe they should 1st be met at your store by the same, not someone in a foul mood.
Bottom line is you have slacked to the point that you have lost me as a customer,  if you care. I passed at least 10 pot shops on the way to yours, wont be doing that again.
Find yourself a Mom and Pop weed shop, there are a few around and patronize them folks, the service, attitude, and vibes here sucked.< /Review>< Pics>

<text>I went into this location last night and Austin was the best! Not only was Austin super professional & friendly.. He recommended a product to me after I told him I was having trouble, it was EXACTLY what I’ve been looking for. I’ve tried many of different dispensary shops as well as different Med Men locations, this shop is hands down my favorite.<//text>< user_id>

Bought an ounce here yesterday terrible herbs had stuff with seeds more potent.

10/17/19:
Came back again, we’re too close in proximity for this not to work out. This time I got an ounce of classic indica for a legit price, have had it before, this is probably the nicest batch I’ve seen of it yet. Oh and David helped me, real cool dude, hip to the game. Still leaving review at 4 stars due to that terrible ounce of ghost daddy by valley Cali. I don’t even think that was real weed. I tried googling the grower, can’t find anything. I’d love to pull a Kramer on Seinfeld and send a sample to a lab with a sample of actual chronic and see if it’s even actually weed.

10/24/19:
Store reached out and made right from previous, first purchase. Definitely went above and beyond to make things right.
Thank you.< /Text>

We stumbled upon this location fairly early on a Saturday just after indulging in some Intelligensia coffee which is just across the street.  We were greeted by a gentleman who invited us in to take a look inside so we saw no reason not to.  The inside of the store is very sleek, designed almost like an Apple store with different products and strains showcased in the display aisles accompanied by descriptive details about the product.  The sign-up process was painless, the place just opened and it was already getting busy, but it went by very quickly nonetheless.  The entire staff was very cordial and professional.  We winded up settling on an more upbeat, energetic product that was relaxing, but not at all heavy.  Definitely a place to check out if you're in the area, their edible selection was also noteworthy!< /text>

This place is very flashy looking, but does not have a nice customer experience. There are no prices marked on any of the wall items. Any time we wanted to know the price of something, we had to wave over an employee to scan it. The employees were not very knowledgeable. My little brother knew more about the science behind the items than the employee we talked to. I also did not appreciate that MedMen requires you to create a profile with them to purchase something. They scan your id and record all of your personal information along with your purchase history. Weed is still federally illegal, so I do not want to be on a list!<//review>

<Review>Called ahead for live resin cartridge and they said they have many to choose from. Get there and they have NONE. Evidently inventory person doesn’t know diff btwn distillate and live resin. Bc we were traveling, we decided to settle on a distillate pen. Trying to pick one of those out with the condescending staff yelling inaccurate things across the room is not my idea of a good experience. I finally just asked for the top shelf cart. Bought the most expensive one they have and it makes us cough like we are dying every time. We threw half of it away when we got home to CO where there is quality and clean product. Cali could learn some things from CO but their condescending tones make it clear they aren’t willing to learn. PLEASE get some good product and knowledgeable employees.
Also, required us to give WAY too much personal information to shop - this is disrespectful to customers - it should be optional.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1550608070014, 'text': 'Hi JJ.

bad costumer service. it was my first time ( i know nothing about all this ) and i was bothering him with my questions. did not even tell me about the flavors so discovered home that i had a berry flavor. when i asked the differences between the different brands he said : well nothing you know when you smoke you smoke ... ohh ok thank you for the info. i wanted my first time to be special. i got it .... but in a bad way.</Review>

First time there! It was very clean and had alot of choices.  Got in and out very fast,everyone was friendly...I gave it a 3 star because I was not aware of the 15% Excise tax AND state tax. Also most clinics give you a goodie bag and something free for first time customers.</Review>

< Review>
Be prepared to pay 23% sales tax for whatever you get! 8% state, 15% "excise". My order was $200 and I paid $250. Apart from the price (of which they graciously let me know about beforehand), my experience was pretty solid. The sales staff were all super friendly and helpful. The way the place is organized was confusing at first but once the sales staff explained to me how everything worked, it was pretty easy to navigate and discover the different kinds of bud I was looking for. 50+ strains to choose from. Vegan edibles. Great quality hash. Everyone was so nice and patient. Pricing is fair... but that tax is going to kill ya. Blue dream and CoD time. Kill confirmed. Collect dog tags to win. Let's goooooooooooooooooo.<//Review>

<review>I felt rushed. I also felt intimidated being in such a small place surrounded by so many men. Not a fan of this business.  I also specifically said i didnt want anything that tasted fruity and they recommended Malibu OG,  and low and behold there i am nauseous af and having to smoke fruity medicine because in no way is Malibu OG the opposite of fruity.

Seemed like they were not trying to help me, but to help themselves by selling product they needed to move, why else would a medmen tell you this will work for you knowing it is the exact opposite of what you wanted???  Shady af.

I gave you two stars because of the guy out front taking new patient info.  He is the only one that treated me like a new patient.  If you guys didnt have that guy i would of definitely went to another place!!!  Too bad the service inside was not the same.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1550608125789, 'text': 'Hi Karri. Thank you for the feedback!

<text>This is by far the worst dispensary experience I have ever had and I’ve had a medical card for 10 years. Medmen is hyped up overpriced cannabis plain and simple. I excitedly went to check them out seeing that they had a 70% off deal for the week prior to compliance taking effect. I brought about $2,000 to go shopping with since I wanted to stock up but absurdly they only have 10mg Edibles which won’t even affect a normal human, nevermind a medical patient. 15 employees for a 500 sq ft store and all of them completely useless and don’t understand the products. Staff was extremely rude and unhelpful. I was told you are not allowed to even look at or inspect the cannabis you’re buying, just a pretty example they put in a little case for you. Ounces of flower are around $400-$500 (double current market price) and concentrates are over $100 per gram. This was hands down the worst dispensary experience I have every had and I left without even spending $1. Go to a delivery service or any small dispensary instead of these greedy corporate people, they have no place being in the cannabis industry.<//text><time>1530197644922</time>< Rate>

Due to popular demand, we have recently lowered the cost of our flower. Unfortunately, California taxes are incredibly high (upwards of 35%), but we must charge them to remain compliant with state law.\n\nCalifornia law also states that all recreational edibles must be 10mg servings with no more than 100mg within the package.

They were great my first visit, and have really had poor customer service and selection the past few months.

I called looking for Breez mints before driving out, my first call, was immediately hung up. I called back the person who answered said “yeah we have those in stock, and the spray” I specified I was looking for the Red mints, and he twice confirmed they were in stock and they “have plenty of them” I tell him I’m on my way. Get there, the door is blocked by an employee chatting with security, and two more employees leaning on a table, backs to the door, chatting, there were several other customers in Store, being ignored by employees, because I guess on Fridays, customer service is an option. One woman came in, grabbed what she wanted and was waiting for over 5 minutes at the register for someone to tend to her. I had asked one of the table leaners, about the Breez mints, he said “yeah, they’ve got a spray now” I explained I was looking for the mints and had been told over the phone they were in stock - he went to the back and spoke with the woman behind the glass, then a third employee joined their conversation, and the three of them were just chatting, for several minutes, the employee then Returned to me stating they had the mints, but they were not processed yet, and they can’t sell them, I asked when they’d be processed, and pressed that the phone answered claimed they were in stock. He shrugged his shoulders and said he didn’t know, and asked who I spoke with, they didn’t identify themselves, but whomever answered 10 minutes or so ago- and he then offered me a discount, next time I go in. I said I wouldn’t be returning since their selection was poor and their service was worse, drawing attention to the woman at the counter, still waiting for someone to ring her up, and how MedMen is supposed to be the Gold standard for weed shops.<//text>

If this is the future of weed this is scary. Top price for not even conneseur quality. I’ve noticed a trend of bud quality decreasing in the past years. They have deals on their in-house strains BUT not one has a potent terpene profile. If your looking for loud flower look else where. This is for novice smokers and novice tourist.

They do have a cool apple like environment. Very impersonal.< /text>

<text>WARNING: As someone who has worked in the marijuana industry and researched extensively, I must give them two stars. Twice I’ve been here and have received incorrect info about cbd, thc, and additional things that are essential to assisting patients with medical needs. The first visit I asked to be shown products I didn’t have to smoke, and they took me to the vape cartridges. This last visit I considered a second chance, and was look for something without thc for a highly sensitive MS patient, and was led to a tincture containing THC. When I pointed it out, she said “It doesn’t matter. It won’t get you high.” I almost laughed out loud. It was as if she didn’t hear me ask for 100% cbd at all. Both visits, the sales person assisting me rattled on and on about benefits of every product I asked about. I got the impression that they’ve been told to sell first, and consider the patient’s actual needs second. I give the two stars because they have good inventory and it’s perfectly fine for a savvy cannabis connoisseur. I advise anyone whose at all uninformed or requiring medical marijuana advice to steer clear and go to a better spot.</text>< userid>

I only vape and I only purchase from MenMen Venice. They carry extreme top top shelf concentrates with THC potency at or above 90%. My favorite is Candy Jack (sativa) current batch weighing in at 92.3%.
THCA isolate is 99.99. This is even better cause it has a nice Candy Jack terpene content. You can Macro or Micro Dose as you desire....it’s all good . 😎<//review>

Seriously I've never smoked their product and said wow thats was some fire!! I only go to MedMen because they take AMEX! No apology for my inconvenience from mgmt, he just shrugged and kept it moving.</review></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) Super professional marijuana shop with a wide variety of products, from general cannabis flowers, cigarette paper, concentrated electronic cigarettes ..., to beverages, chocolates ..., to clothes, candles ... and other peripherals, there are many more cannabis-related products !!

Generally, marijuana shops don't sell lighters. You can also run a cigarette hotel after buying marijuana, but MedMen sells lighters, so you don't have to.

Friends who like marijuana must not miss this store, it's great!

(Original)
超級專業的大麻店，商品種類非常多元，從一般大麻花、捲煙紙狀、濃縮電子煙...，到飲料、巧克力...，到衣服、蠟燭...等周邊，超級多大麻相關製品！

一般大麻店還沒賣打火機這小東西，買完大麻還要跑一趟煙酒店，但MedMen有賣打火機，省得跑一趟。

喜歡大麻的朋友不能錯過這家店，非常棒！</review>

The reason I gave this location 5 stars is because they do have great customer service. The area that it's in is not the best you see some coo-coo people but every where you go now in days you see more and more people like that.
Anyways everyone always smiles and tries there best even when it gets crazy busy.
If you ever been a waitress, waiter or barista you know what its like to try and please everyone and stay calm even at the most of craziest of times,some people that have never been that don't understand and just expect you to hurry up with there coffee plate of food or whatever. I've seen people be inpatient not at this place in particular yet but sometimes we are all so in rush with our day we just need to take a step back relax and enjoy our coffee time stay cool peeps!< /Text>

It was great coffee...but, I tipped her $1.00 for a $8.50 drive-thru order.....I told her to keep the $1:00 and she asked me, "Do you want the $.50? Was a $1:00 tip for a drive- thru , too little....I am a generous tipper at restaurants, especially take outs during Covid..but this just seemed strange and made me feel cheap!<//Text>

I just moved on this side of town and I live in between this store and the one on Clinton & 99. So far I like this little Starbucks better because they are fast & super friendly. My drinks are more taste consistent when made at this location.</Text>

< Review>
The barista that was there  at the window, on the day I went kept giving me the wrong coffee !! She ended up giving me three different coffees. And besides that she cheated me out of $65 that I had left on my Starbucks card, and my mistake was not asking for a receipt after all her mistakes!!!!! I will never go to that Starbucks again. It's the Starbucks on Ashlan and West.</Review>

For the last 2 Starbucks app orders, they failed to put in my 2 add ons and I rarely go here so a treat with starbucks was disappointing. My passionfruit drink didn't have the coconut milk and my Mango Draginfruit lemonade didn't have the extra scoop of strawberries I ordered even when I asked the girl if there was the scoop I ordered. Wasted my money. Other times when I get the classic caramel frappes it is good but other than that, special directions aren't followed.</review>

Very rude barista. Her name is destiny. She messed up our  order and then overcharged us. She should not be a Starbucks barista . I go there I expect my Starbucks to be served by a happy upbeat person and all I got was bad attitude. The one on Manchester is great and friendly. For how much I pay for coffee, I expect  a good attitude  and better customer  service.< /Review>

I like how people of varying ethnicities and backgrounds merge for discussion outside when the weather permits.

< review>
I asked what sweetener options they had and Barista didn't offer all the sweetener options available. Instead I specifically had to ask for honey for my tea and then she said "oh yeah we have that too". Mediocre service... could have been a better experience. It wasn't busy either so she wasn't rushed... this Starbucks is inside Target on Shaw/Marks.< /review>

<Review>Went today about 2:45p, starbucks on West & Ashlan.  Placed an order for caramel macchiato, it tasted watery to me so I came back & asked to have it remade.  The young blonde millennial making the drinks obviously had an attitude about it.  When she finished  my drink I told her thank you, her response was, "yep"😐.  Anyone working in a public establishment or anywhere in that type of environment, you would think she would know to say, "you are welcome" with a smile.  I will never return.  There are so many other Starbucks i can give my money to with a more professional attitude like "Feland & W Shaw".  It is out of my way but it's worth it to me.< /Review>< pics>

My husband and I were visiting family here...On our way back home I googled the nearest Starbucks this one came up,We went through drive-thru and ordered 2 Vente carmel frappuchino,when we started to drink them one had only crushed up ice beige color with Carmel is was awful and the second one had everything with hardly no ice...I wanted to go back but we had to get back to sacramento...I was very upset!!<//text>

It looks small from the outside and it may be a little small inside but they get my drinks right and the sitting area at times can be a little packed but its kept clean inside</Text>

Amazing facility! The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Our puppy is pretty skittish but they handled her like a champ. Love that there’s an app as well, makes reviewing her records/invoices easy and the chat functionality has come in handy post-spay when we had follow up questions about her recovery. Even weekend and evening responses via chat were speedy.</Review>

The Modern Animal app has especially been so useful during COVID - it was so easy to make an appointment and chat with vet techs who patiently answered all my questions. During the appointment, we were greeted safely and immediately in the designated parking lot and I was able to video chat the vet during the whole appointment via the app. We humans even got cold brew and root beer while we waited! Thank you Dr Storm and everyone for genuinely caring for my dog!< /review>< UserId.>

Modern Animal offers such a seamless virtual and in person experience. They’re app offers 24/7 support at no additional cost, and their veterinarians have been wonderful with our two pups. Doctor Parks & Doctor Storm in particular have been a joy to work with, and have built lasting relationships with us and the boys. Thank you to the entire team at Modern Animal.<//text>

What an amazing vetrinarian! After moving down from San Francisco, this place helped make our little guy at home! He was completely comfortable and the fact that everything can be done through their app was so convenient and nice!

Thank you Modern Animal for having us within your family 🙂<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>This was the best vet experience I've had in 11 years. The app is flawless, communication seamless, and the quality of care was amazing. Dr. Parks and Christina were stellar. Out last vet would muzzle my dog immediately, but Modern Animal gave him a chance to acclimate to them and he didn't need one! Even though I couldn't go into the office due to COVID, I knew what was going on at all times and was able to see my dog in the exam room with the doctor via video through the app. My dog also left with a toy he picked out and is now obsessed with. We paid for our membership fee on our first visit, and even with the fee (which includes all visits, 24/7 chat, and virtual visits) it still cost less than our last vet. I cannot recommend Modern Animal enough!<//review>< pics>

The doctor and technician were so informative and helpful. Love that they review all costs with you before doing anything and that you have record of your approval in the app. No surprises or hidden fees. I had one of the earlier appointments in the day on a Saturday and during my time I saw quite a few more people arrive so probably best to get in as early as you can. Seems very popular place.</Text>< Name>

<text>There is only one word to describe Modern Animal: STELLAR. My appointment was with Dr. Storm, and she is kind, professional, and thorough; talking to her after her assessment demonstrates her above and beyond care. Every technician and/or nurse I spoke to was just as incredible, and they really demonstrate what high quality staff they are. The pricing is transparent, they create a plan with you, and the app is seamless. This will be my only vet clinic from here on out!</text><rate>5<//rate>< Name>

The least stressful experience at a vet! They communicate throughout the entire visit even though owners aren’t allowed in for COVID safety. Estimates are given on the average and high scales for transparency which is very helpful. My cat has never responded so well to a vet or techs!<//review>

Modern vet medicine for the modern animal. No waiting in a lobby with a bunch of animals while you wait for your pet to be seen. Takes every bit of stress out of the visit! 100% stress free. Beau loved it too! Watched him give his nurse tons of puppy kisses 🐶 Thank you from me & Beau!!<//Review>

Just the best veterinarian clinic I ever did find! I can’t recommend enough. They are friendly, patient with my million and one questions, professional and warm. Customer service is top notch. It’s also no more expensive than past vets, yet the service is leap years better. Thank you!</review>

<Review>Man, what a fantastic vet office. We LOVE the messaging option because who wants to wait on hold to speak with someone? Everyone is so sweet. I can’t recommend Modern Animal enough. I’ve never seen my pets this comfortable for an appointment before.
And with COVID Modern Animal is doing a video chat with the doctor which means so much to us. I can’t stand the idea of my pet with a vet I’ve never met in an environment I’ve never been in. They’re our babies. I want to know they’re comfy and having this relationship with our doctor is priceless.
Also, shoutout to Adriana (I believe she was the “host”/tech super lovely! And Dr. Parks is a gem. We’re bringing all of our cats too see Dr. Parks in the future. :) she really took the time to speak with us. We’re customers forever.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<text>Our first experience and we luv Modern Animal.
1. Park your call in the designated numbered stall in the back parking lot.
2. Call them to let them know you have arrived for your pet’s appointment.
3. Alyssa, Ambassador member will come out and check you in, ask you questions even offer something to drink. (non-alcoholic):)
4. Alina, Nurse comes out and asks more detailed questions and takes your pet inside.
5. Dr. McNeil examined our pet.
6. Video chat with doctor with her exam results.
All in the safety of our car. I’m a fan. LUV THEM!< /text>< pics>

The care teams are great (shout out to Dr. McNeil), they offer you beverages while you're waiting in the car instead of going in thanks to current events, they're responsive in the app, and you don't have to worry about exam fees when you get in the door because your membership is all taking care of that.

Highly recommended!</Text>< user_id>

<text>Beyond thrilled to have found Modern Animal!
We moved from NY a month ago and were nervous we wouldn’t find a vet we loved as much as our last but as soon as I jumped on a call to book a last minute appt for our dog I just immediately knew we wouldn’t regret it. The woman on the phone was beyond helpful and kind- something you don’t find everywhere.

Our appointment was today and it went SO smoothly, they treated our dog as if he was their own and although we were in the car while our pup was inside- the process was seamless thanks to their incredible app!

Highly recommend 💕< /text>< pics>

I usually don't write google reviews, but these people are super legit! I love their virtual services where you can write in any concerns or set up a video call and they respond within minutes. They also give excellent advice and have the best bedside manner. Highly recommend this business and so glad they are here in LA!<//Review>

Just moved to LA and was looking for a vet. Saw all the 5 star reviews so I brought my Australian Shepherd here. They were extremely responsive, thorough, and thoughtful. Overall great experience and my dog left a happy pup.<//Review>

The scarier things about being a pet owner usually happen outside of business hours and texting them when something happens has been a stress reliever.  Everyone is always kind and thoughtful.

After a bad experience with a different vet, I was hesitant when picking a new one for my dog. However, Modern Animal has superseded all of my expectations! The membership structure alleviates the stress of paying for appointments, they are upfront about all costs, thorough, accurate, professional and super responsive. I love their app, it makes it so easy! Virtual visits or in-person, I feel that my dog is being very well cared for especially as we are dealing with some health issues. I was so blown away when they remembered he was having a bone scan elsewhere and sent me a message that day to ask how it went. My experience thus far has been excellent!< /text>

The staff at Modern Animal responds within minutes of chatting them on the app. We brought our dog in for his first appointment and they were very thorough, and explained everything we were paying for individually. I am very happy to have my dog be a part of the modern animal family.  It is very comforting to have quick answers and easy access when needed without breaking the bank!< /review>

Besides the excellent customer service by every member of the staff and doctors I’ve spoken to, the very convenient ease of doing every single thing through a very user-friendly app and how safe I feel leaving my pet in their hands,  I was positively surprised when I learned that something that was already on my estimate turned out to not be necessary so it was taken off the bill. The most common frustration I find with vets is not knowing what is or isn’t necessary and if they’re doing both what’s best for your pet and what will save the owner unnecessary expenses (specially in the situation we are living, we always want whats best for our animals but its tough for everyone right now) so its very trust-inspiring to see that we can rely on the professional to use and do only what’s really needed! Thank you guys, stay awesome!< /text>

<text>Kind staff, and during COVID their app makes the experience a million times better. 24/7 support. Nothing will ever be 100% perfect when you can’t join your pet in the actual exam rooms, but their app and support staff are next best thing. Just started bringing our cat here and have been very satisfied with his treatment.</text></record></dataset><record>

I found Modern Animal through word of mouth and have been so impressed. They are the One Medical of vet experiences.
The staff are responsiv, kind, and loooove animals. They treat my pup so well that he comes back all tuckered out from the attention.
I've only seen Dr. McNeil so far but she's fantastic. Informative, clear, and so friendly.
The visit experience is incredibly covid conscious and I'm super grateful to have good and safe pet care during the Covid pandemic.<//Review>

<Text>We took our rescue pup to Modern Animal the other day for the first time to see his vet, Dr. Parks. We had been clients of Dr. Parks at her previous clinic, and she provides an incredible quality of care so we followed her when she moved to Modern Animal and were not disappointed. She is knowledgeable, professional, and patient with all of our questions. Everything is contact free for covid, but the staff were friendly and helpful, even offering coffee and LaCroix. Dr. Parks did a thorough exam and diagnosed our dog’s ear infection. Even though our dog is a rescue and is rather scared of new places and experiences, Dr. Parks‘ calming demeanor put him at ease. The vet techs and administrative staff were all very helpful as well, and the chat/video call features of the app worked very well. They sent us home with medicine and a new toy for our good boy (pictured below!) If you need a vet, look no further than Dr. Parks and Modern Animal!!</Text>< pictures>

This place is incredible! I can’t say enough good things about my experience and the staff here.

A bit of background: a few months ago I adopted my cat, King Rumble, who is FIV positive and has a heart murmur, and when I initially took him to get looked at, the vet had a horrible bedside manner and I felt uncomfortable asking questions about what was going on. She suggested I bring him back to the shelter which was really insensitive especially because I was already attached!

Our experience Modern Animal couldn’t have been better. Their app is super easy to use, and the video chat feature was awesome. They kept me updated every step of the way in terms how how my sweetie was doing, what costs would be, etc. Because my cat has health problems, the $100 yearly membership fee which includes unlimited visits and 24/7 text support is an incredible value. Not to mention everyone I interacted with was helpful and friendly. One of the ladies even took some cute pics of him chilling in the exam room and sent them to me!  I highly recommend,  you will not be disappointed!< /Text>

Such a wonderful experience with Dr. Storm, John and Sara this morning at Modern Animal. They took wonderful care of our new kitten Goldie, we're so knowledgeable as they thoroughly answered all of our care questions, and had such warm bedside manner with her while a we video chatted them during her check-up. Very pleased with the entire experience and they're taking great precaution in our current state of socially distancing. Looking forward to bringing our cat Ollie to visit them later this week. A+ all!</Text>

I usually hate bringing my cat to the vet, but the staff at Modern Animal really eased my nerves. My cat was picked up at my car by a friendly tech wearing full protective gear and the appointment was done via video conference. The tech sent me pics and updates as the exam went along, which made me feel better. Dr. Storm did the most thorough check-up my cat has ever had. Because of her work, I can take care of my cats health so she'll be around for years to come.< /text>

The doctor Video chatted with us during the visit, have us our options, didn’t try and up sell the visit and was very nice. We’ve tried several vets and this was by far the best.

I brought my dog to Modern Animal for his yearly wellness check and used the curbside drop off. The team called me the day before to get a his full history, and more importantly to inquire about any fear / anxiety issues he may have had in the past. The clinic was easy to find, and I used the in app chat to let them know we arrived. We were greeted by a friendly vet tech Sara, and then were guided through the appointment by Annette. Though we could be present by video conference for the exam, I chose to just use the chat. Dr. Storm gave a thorough report and I had opportunity to ask questions and review the invoice before I was charged. I then pulled back around and my little guy was returned to me at the car.

Overall it was a seamless experience, and I felt very safe considering the current environment with all the precautions they were taking. We love Dr. Storm and encourage all to try this new pet friendly (and human friendly!) group< /Review>

Best veterinary experience we’ve ever had! We usually have a concierge at home vet come do visits for our babies. The modern animal team was even better than that! They kept us updated every step of the way and were so patient and kind answering all of our many questions. Thank you for taking such good care of my Jellybean 😊</Review>

<Review>My dog had her first visit today as a home visit, and Modern Animal is incredible. They took the time to fully assess her and she wasn't scared at all, which is a first for her. In fact, she was actually very excited the entire time. After her assessment, she received a care plan that covered way more than any vet ever has. We've seen multiple vets in her lifetime because none have been a good fit for her, but I've definitely found the vet I'm sticking with.< /Review><name>Kai Valerius<//name><Pics>None< /Pics><UserId.>104213473349201598217</UserId.><GmapID>0x80c2b975eeefa2bf:0x4f60ed68bdb50310< /GmapID></record>

I love Modern Animal. I have a high strung, nervous little pup who normally cries and shakes and screams at every vet appointment - not at Modeen Animal! The vets, techs and all staff are so loving, kind and peaceful in their approach that my little one comes out happy and relaxed.

Their subscription based service model means there's always someone for me to talk to if I have a concern. Their direct and honest pricing lets me know exactly what is happening and the exact costs. Cost comparison shopping has shown that their prices are actually lower than most other clinics in the area.

I highly recommend Modern Animal and hope to see locations all over soon!</Text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>I have switched to this vet after feeling that the service I received at my past vet was extremely subpar. Not only is the customer service 100% better, but the doctors have taken the time over and over to help me find solutions for my cat's issue and don't try to send me big expensive unnecessary tests. The doctors here are great. If you're on the fence give them a try, chatting at them through the app is a lot easier than what I was dealing with before.< /Text></record>

Such an amazing experience from start to finish. When I first called to get information on the process, Nikki (I think that was her name) was so helpful on the phone. From there I downloaded the app and scheduled an appointment. They  called me the day before to ask what my dogs favorite treats were! They are are all about making the animals feel as comfortable and stress free as possible. They even went out of their way to contact our old vet and obtain all his records. When it came time for the appointment, things were a little different given the restrictions  from COVID-19 as I could go inside. But they video chatted with me the whole time throughout the exam, and Dr. Bonnell was very thorough in explaining everything to me. They sent me my estimate via the app, and it was broken down so clearly. Not to mention the prices are super reasonable! And they even gave my dog a little treat bag with a toy (that he loves) when we left. So happy we found Modern Animal!<//Review>

<resp>None< /resp><review>In my 34 years of having animal companions, modern animal was hands down the best vet I have ever experienced. Not only do they have an incredible business model with a tremendous value ($99 for the year and no exam fees!! What?!) but the people at modern animal were wonderful! Dr. Storm and the entire staff were helpful, professional, and communicative, and Mackerel and I cannot thank them enough!

What happened: Mackerel slipped off the bathroom sink and busted his chin. Within two minutes I did a virtual vet visit ( incredible I had a professional opinion almost instantly at home), and was advised that it's best to check out the split in person, just to be safe. They got me in same day within two hours, took care of Mack, who didn't need stitches, cleaned his little wound, and we didn't have to pay anything!! Oh, and all this happened during this quarantine, in which they took extra precautions to make sure everyone was safe and everything was sanitized. I wasn't allowed in for covid concerns, but they video conferenced me through the entire appointment. Talk about leveraging technology!

Again, thank you Modern Animal and everyone there!! I'll be recommending you folks to everyone i know!

(FYI: copied and pasted this from my yelp review cause I’m lazy! They are still just as awesome!)</review><Rate>5</Rate>< name>

Truly fantastic experience - even with all of the safety measures for COVID, we were given wonderful customer service. Our pup, Paul, has terrible anxiety at the vet. The team at MA took their time with him petting him and giving him treats. I was video conferenced in for the entire examination. When we returned for another visit, the vet tech even helped administer his shot in the parking lot to calm his nerves. The staff and vet went above and beyond, thank you!< /Review>

The best vet I’ve ever been to. Everyone is responsive, friendly, and knowledgeable. Ayla and Colie even responded to me outside of normal business hours late at night when we had an emergency and we’re extremely helpful. I highly recommend Modern Animal.< /Review>

< Review>
Came in looking for a mattress. I liked something firm. Not too firm but not too cushion firm either. After explaining the kinds of issues I have with my back, Trina knew exactly what I was looking for. Shes very professional and friendly. Great customer service. She suggest mattresses that are worth the bargain but will also find something in your price range.< /Review>

Came here looking for a mattress and Dan showed us the best option for the type of mattress for me and Wife. I didn’t realize how much information one needed in order to pick a mattress. Luckily for us he was there to educate us and help us find the best mattress for us so we could finally have a good nights sleep. He was able to help us with the finance the mattress that we wanted and just made our mattress buying experience awesome.< /Review>

<review>Just came from Sit’n Sleep and wanted to compare more mattresses and take the opportunity to get a great deal with the holiday sale. I was actually looking at mattress on Amazon a few months ago but you obviously can not compare mattress online by just reading reviews; unless you buy it first then test it at home. I came in with my boyfriend  today and we were educated by Trina with the brands they sold here. We compared about 10 mattress, some of the higher end brands with some of their own store brands before we made our final decision on a great deal she helped us out with. She was very thorough with the finance and the technology the mattress included. She even included more tips on how to save more money since we weren’t looking for a box spring. I must say I was very pleased with her exceptional, professional and friendly service. I would definitely recommend Ortho Mattress in Whittier. You NEED to test the mattress in person. Don’t by shy—just go on in!
Thank you Trina!</review><Response>{'time': 1565655858619, 'text': 'Machi ,\n\nThank you for your kind words! We’re happy to hear you had a great experience with our great team here. Sleep well!'}</Response>< gmap_id>

Just wanted to say what a great experience I had making this purchase, Trina was a true professional in every way. Tina is a very good listener when it came to fulfilling the special needs for my 91 year old Mother. Knowing the circumstances I was dealing, Trina found the perfect bed, it's been 2 months now and my mother is a happy camper. I  was so impressed with my experience, a month later I purchases another bed for myself.<//Text>

Amazing customer service. Trina was an excellent sales rep. We didn't like our initial purchase, we were not happy with our first mattress and Trina made swapping to a different mattress a breeze. She was very thorough and knowledgeable about mattress quality and materials. She also through in some additional perks. While Trina was busy with another customer, the other sales rep Will was also very knowledgeable and helpful. We are very happy with our purchase and the excellent service that was provided.<//text>

I knew that we would need to shop with someone who was knowledgeable and concerned for our needs. Trina helped us find the best fit for us and walked us through every step of the way. Our customer service experience here was incomparable to any other store we’d visited! Thank you Trina for everything, we’ll be recommending all friends and family to Ortho Mattress Whittier!<//Review>< time>

I was extremely satisfied  and impressed  with the customer service I received from Trina she was very helpful and extremely knowledgeable  I previously went to sit ‘n sleep and the customer service representative there was no help he didn’t really explain anything to me but Trina was amazing . I also really liked that she didn’t push me to buy the most expensive mattress she suggested whatever fit in my price range.  She really informed me which mattress would suit best for me I have lower back pain so she explained and showed me the mattresses that would best suit for me.  I highly highly recommend this location ask for Trina!<//Text>

<review>Excellent Customer Service!!! TRINA called the warehouse and was able to schedule next-day deliver of a special order mattress! Most places I called didn't have them, or would have to order it and delivery would take up to 2 weeks. I needed it ASAP. TRINA found what I needed, applied discounts without me asking and arranged for removal of old mattress upon delivery of new.  Thank you so much TRINA for being so polite and professional! Give this girl a raise!< /review>< date>

been in several times looking at a aireloom mattress  got a price found a better price up the street for the same mattress. felt obligated to return because i had used so much of their time offered them to price match($2500) the mattress the salesman called the manager to match the price and the management at this place told her they they could sell that mattress at $3700 so i went to orange county mattress and purchased my mattress. there unwillingness to price match only cost them more sorry ortho you were less than a block from my house.< /Review>

Being a younger couple, we were looking for something affordable. Trina helped us out and was so helpful with showing us different options and giving us time to test out the beds. We found one that we fell in love with and it is scheduled for delivery tomorrow. Not bad at all, seeing as it was a Sunday purchase and we went in to just look. No pressure at all, very please with everything. Great service and prices. She went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of! 10 stars ⭐️ all day if I could.<//Review>

Walking into any store these days, especially in California! can often be a discouraging experience. I've noticed anywhere you go...there is a complete lack of customer care, and appretiation. Often you find yourself searching for things you need for hours because typically, you are never offered help anymore...and if you are employees don't even seem to know anything about the products they sell or their way around the store they work in.
My husband and I were searching for our first actual mattress together, we had been sleeping on the worst mattress for many years and at this point ANYTHING would have been better. We planned the day around going from outlet to outlet, and finding the best deal possible. The very first outlet we walked into, we were not greeted, and we had to search for someone to ask a question, the employee then stood there akwardly, and silently (only giving us pricing information) and once we said we'd come back, he was gone.
The second, and FINAL stop was Ortho Inc. in Fountain Valley. We were actually in search of a different store nearby and couldn't find it and so happy we didn't! We walked into, the cleanest, nicest location...and greeted instantly by a bubbly, smiling face...we felt like she was excited to see us...like long lost friends!
The very first thing she did was ask our names and introduce herself (Sunny!!) and engaged in conversation like she had known us forever. She took her time, she mentioned she did not work at this store but you wouldn't know AT ALL, she knew where everything was, and exactly what she wanted to show us. You could tell this women loved her job, and was excited to help us find our first mattress. She did everything she could to help us choose the perfect one. She took her time checking on our financing options, she gave us time to discuss our concerns and offered us a deal we COULD NOT refuse.
We had a bit of concerns and thought we might have to come back, she gave us all of her information and even offered her cell phone number if we had any questions. We made it to the parking lot and within 3 minutes came back in to purchase the bed.
Sunny is amazing, courteous, friendly, and she mde us feel so important. This is truly what world class service is all about and we couldn't imagine going anywhere else, or to anyone else. Thanks, Sunny! You changed our lives in one day! No more back aches, and restless nights.</Review>

We purchased a Serta mattress and a Motion Perfect base a few months ago from Zuman. Zuman took his time, explained all of our options. We felt no pressure whatsoever. Our son is in heaven with his new bed!

My husband and I decided today, we too wanted to have that little slice of heaven. We returned to purchase the same bed and base only in a larger size. We were hoping Zuman would be working so we could have that same experience, however, he was not, Trina, however, was quick to welcome us to the store with her big beautiful smile. She too was efficient, knowledgeable, as well as personable!

While Trina was writing us up, our disabled son found a friend in William! What an awesome young man he is.

Great store, great employees, great products!

Thank you!<//text>

<Review>HORRIBLE customer service AND salesman, NICK! When first arriving salesman was asleep, snoring in his chair at his desk. First sign I should have just went elsewhere! Ortho mattress are a total rip off!! I paid nearly 2700.00 that is with a comfort exchange for a bed that is very uncomfortable! First off within one month they charge you over 300.00 to exchange a bed. They make you wait 30 days to make sure you are miserable! After the second bed I was told to rotate my bed to git rid of air holes! Really?!! After continuously complaining and offering to pay more for a comfortable bed, salesman Nick offers to send a mattress inspector out to get an exchange from their "phenomenal customer service". 3rd party mattress inspector comes out a week later sends a report in and I get a report in the mail 10 days after inspected saying since the mattress does not visibly go in 1 1/2 inches it does not meet standards. The mattress sags on all edges! You slide right off and only when laying in it you feel yourself sink in separate spots. I told customer service this and they say "well the mattress inspector isn't going to lay in your bed"..... with a rude attitude! Nothing but rude customer service! I go back to the salesman, Nick telling him he sold me their warranty. Because their guarantee I spent so much money for what I expected to be a good quality bed. He tells me "I am just the salesman and I can't do anything for you". How rude is that?! He can't even offer to make any calls for me! Instead he sends me to a mattress inspector who tells me to take it up with Ortho customer service, who blames the mattress inspector for his report. I took my horrible experience to corporate and I get the same attitude! My husband and I had major back problems and had miserable days due to lack of sleep. $2,645.00 DOWN THE DRAIN! ORTHO IS UNLOYAL AND A TOTAL RIP OFF!</Review>< pics>

We just bought the perfect mattress at Ortho in Whittier, thanks to Zaman. He explained all the details we needed to know, even though we had no clue what to look for. He had us try several mattresses at different pricepoints. We fell in love with the Club Signature PT by Ortho as soon as we laid down together. We also bought the premium matress encasement, which ended up being complimentary with our Yelp check in offer. We are getting free delivery to our new apartment in the area in a week from now. Thank you Zaman!</text>

<Review>This winery was amazing and had a great selection of wine to taste.  We were able to get there late and the lady who helped us made sure we were comfortable and enjoying our wines. She let us sample a wine that we ended up purchasing, my husband is not a wine drinker but she was able to find something he fell in love with!

Nice location, friendly staff and pleasant wines. The seating outside is enjoyable. I have visited a couple of times since it is always such a nice place to visit and not far from home. Just wish they offered more affordable options for wine memberships. $1,100 a year as the cheapest option is a bit steep for a wine novice.</Text>

As far as food goes, they chips and roasted almonds for purchase if you want a Scooby snack.<//text>< pictures>

We started off at Starmont and we couldn't think of a better place to start! The ambiance was excellent, the decor extremely chic and modern. The wines simply amazing cannot even pick a favorite! I'm typically not into medium bodied red wines but these were simply awesome. James was super great in taking care of our needs. Would highly recommend stopping by on your Napa Valley trip.<//review>

<Review>While I am not a big drinker to begin with, my husband and I do from time-to-time enjoy taking a nice day trip to Napa Valley. We decided to stop by Starmont Winery as we are familiar with some of their wines. What a great decision this turned out to be. We enjoyed sipping on their Cabernet while taking in the wonderful views from their vineyard. The hosts treated us well and we brought home a couple of wonderful wines to enjoy the next time we have some guests over.<//Review>< rating>

<Text>Walked in for a tasting and was not greeted.  Instead, I was asked if I was there for a tasting?  Yes. A clipboard was put down in front of me and the bearded man informed me, "We're starting an event in an hour, so if you want a tasting..." In other words, hurry up...we've got more important things to get to.  I left immediately.  This is hardly the only vineyard in the neighborhood, one expects to be treated with a modicum of graciousness!  You have an event?  Good for you, you'll never make a sale with me or my friends, family and associates.  Go elsewhere where your business is welcome. There's plenty more to choose from.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Starmont was the final winery we visited at the end of a weekend in Napa. It was by far our favorite!! Although we didn’t have a reservation they were able to accommodate our party of two because we stopped by earlier in the day. I think next time we’ll make a reservation just to be sure to get a spot :)

The outdoor area is comfy and accessible by anyone (not just club members like some places). We enjoyed a fantastic wine tasting outside (only $25) and bought two bottles to take home. The wine was simply amazing and reasonably priced. Our host Dan was friendly and knowledgeable—you could tell he knows a lot about wine and loves sharing about it! Dan made our experience educational and enjoyable. Next time we come to Napa this winery is top on my list!<//review>

Absolutely excellent wine. Out of four wineries we went to in the area, this was our favorite. Spencer was incredibly helpful & knowledgeable. I wish there was an option for leaving him a tip - but this will suffice. It was a great experience overall!<//Review>

<review>This winery, just south of Napa, opened in July. That's why there are so few reviews. The staff was amazing, and the outdoor seating area was very pleasant (and dog friendly). Every wine we tasted was delicious and had a neat story. They also have free popcorn with gourmet salts on the side (the white truffle oil salt was yummy). I'd recommend a stop here to anyone.<//review>< resp>

Visited some wineries this weekend while on vacation and Starmont was hands down the best winery I went to all weekend. The staff were very knowledgeable and friendly, the location was convenient, the tasting room and seating area was beautiful, and the wines were fantastic. They have a really lovely fire pit area with comfortable couches and chairs and even blankets you can use if you get a bit chilly. What really made the difference in my mind was the staff. They were really accommodating and just good people all around. Some of the other places we went to, people were a bit snobbish and it felt like they could care less whether you were there or not. I highly recommend the GSM blend and their Chardonnay. Both were pretty fantastic in my opinion.<//text>

<username>Maria< /username><text>My friends and I planned a fun filled time in Napa with a day of wine tasting. Starmont was our last winery of the day, but decided to pop in and try some wines. Granted, we were there 35 minutes before they closed, and boy did the woman that helped us let us know it. We weren't looking for some elaborate wine tasting, as we had done that all day, but how about making your guests feel welcome which would ultimately encourage us to purchase wine from you in the future?!? This women was rude, kurt, and clearly unhappy with her job. I'm actually surprised that we stayed and ordered a glass anyways. This winery is still a topic every time we return to Napa to enjoy wine and spend money, but guess what Starmont? you'll never see us again, and how unfortunate because we actually enjoyed the wine...<//text><Rate>1<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

<text>Made reservations for my husband and myself when we arrived we were given a table. Within 15 minutes we were told that the table was reserved for party of 4 that was to be arriving soon so we would have to move. I asked where was the table that I reserved? The man walked off and then came back and said oh never mind you can keep this table. We were there for about an hour and there was never an arrival of a party of four....strange experience overall</text>< pictures>

Perhaps I went on a bad day... we arrived around 2pm on a Saturday. We often frequent Napa and Sonoma to pick up our wine club selections and have always noticed starmont when coming in and figured we would try it this time around.We walked in and noticed it was fairly crowded. There is a lot of seating inside of the tasting room and every seat was taken, there was plenty of room at the wine bar though. We walked up and waited patiently. There were 3 workers behind the counter and we waited around 10 minutes and was not acknowledged once. There were 2 other couples there, so I feel that there was at least some time to say we will be with you in a bit or at least a hello... but we sat there and waited. This gave us the opportunity to look around at the crowd. It was a pretty young crowd. Everyone seemed to be 21, which is fine, but it was rather loud and you could hear the random "OMG" once in awhile, similar to a bar. This environment reminded me of my college days and although it was only 6 years ago, it is something that I want nothing to do with. There was even a girl taking multiple selfies, sipping wine and posting it on snapchat. I am a former wine buyer and was disappointed that I was not able to try their wines, but the environment was very off setting. If this place wants to cater to this crowd, that is fine. This review is more aimed at those who want a relaxing environment and, frankly, want semi-decent customer service. If you just turned 21 or are new to wine, then this is the place for you.<//review>

Great food and service. The lamb was amazing and tasty. The angel hair pasta is simple and very flavorful. The desserts are phenomenal. Staff is very helpful and caring. Make a reservation especially if weekends. Good outdoor seating available too.<//Review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Amazing experience at this adorable, cozy and delicious restaurant just up the road from the main strip in Montecito! Pane e Vino is tucked away in the corner of a cute little shopping center on E Valley Road, just a quick minute off the 101 Fwy. It has outdoor, patio and inside dining, beautiful setting. We went for lunch on a Saturday and it was quiet and peaceful, honestly far better than waiting for one of the crowded, expensive spots on the main drag. Food was off the charts good! Italian owned and operated for 32 years, they use locally sourced fresh produce and high quality ingredients. The olive oil was rich and delicious, it was quality. The chef custom made chicken piccatta off menu for my dad and it was the best I’ve ever tasted. I had the spinach salad and added grilled shrimp. Their pancetta and grilled shrimp were amazingly good.. this was the BEST salad I have ever had. Service was amazing.. loved our serving staff. This is a local’s favorite that we stumbled upon and it was an absolute gem! Bravo Pane e Vino for providing a first class experience across the board! Worth every penny!< /text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

The staff is fantastic and the food is amazing. It's tiny and crowded so you may have to wait for a seat but it's worth it. Besides, sometimes you can get into interesting conversation with your neighbors.

If you like Italian this is the best place in town. From the bruschetta to the tiramisu everything is fresh and perfectly done. We've had fish, pasta, and chicken and are never disappointed.

The staff has always made us feel like family, and that's something you just can't fake. They work together as a team to make sure you have a great meal.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Traditional Italian fare, consistantly pretty good but not great. Comfortable place that hasn't changed in many years. Bathrooms r still upstairs in an old office bldg with carpet and facilities that are decades old. I actually love that this place hasn't changed a bit over the years, and that I can still get my favorite dishes. They have specials, but the basic menu never changes. Easy enough place to bring kids, esp if you are willing to sit on patio.</Review>

Not a good sign when the first thing out of the waiters mouth is I forgot about you. Had the mussels they were excellent. Had the whole wheat pasta for dinner tonight pretty average my husband had the Veal chop it was tasty. The whole experience would have been much better with a more experienced server that wasn't grumpy and seemed overwhelmed at his job.<//Review>

We go to Italy at least twice a year sometimes more, the food at pane e vino is as good and many times better than what we experience in Italy. We know for a fact the owner searches and imports regulary products from Italia that just are not available here. From the cooks to the serving staff....none better!<//Review>

<text>The service was deplorable. Waiter was unfriendly, disinterested, and inattentive. Food was good but nothing out of the ordinary. Trattorria Vittoria in Santa Barbara is a much better choice than this restaurant. I seriously doubt I will ever go back. I would not (will not) recommend this restaurant to either family or friends! Very disappointing.</text>< Pics>

<Text>I went to this place probably 15 years ago when they were at their previous location.  It was amazing back then. I can happily say this place is amazing as it was back then. Just a new location.  Same amazing service.  The food is just as I remember it aka everything being great.  Chicharrones here are life changing.  Just go.  Stop reading this. Go here!< /Text>< user>

< Review>
WOO-HOO!!!

This place has *THE BEST* Mexican food around here.
& I'm not lying.

If you're looking for great customer service and amazingly fresh and authentic Mexican Cuisine you have to come here!! When have I steered you wrong?

Miguel, one of the owners is always so cheery and helpful--always willing to suggest you the best platter for your needs. I've tried almost their entire menu:

*Pozole
*Menudo
*Tortas de Asada
*Tacos de Al Pastor
*Tacos de Chicharron
*Tacos de Carnitas
*Torta de Jamon
*Tacos de Asada
*Quesadillas
*Asada Fries
*Tamales
*Champurrado
*Aguas Frescas; Guava, Sandia & Horchata!

Looking back at all I've had at this awesome place, EVERY SINGLE MEAL has blown me out of the water. You just have to try this place, already!!

*-Bonus-* Taco Tuesdays= 99 cents!!

You can order for pick-up, or dine-in. There are a couple of tables inside where you can enjoy your hot meal. Can't wait for you to go. I just know you're going to love it.
Let me know how you liked it! ;o)<//Review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) I love to buy the meat here, even if you pay a little more than the superior, the meat here does not turn black the next day. Those who work here are friendly. Apparently you can also send money here and change checks (I have not used those services myself but I have seen them do it) I totally recommend you buy your meats here.

Me encanta comprar la carne aquí, aún que se paga poquito mas que la superior la carne de aqui no se pone negra al día siguiente. Los que trabajan aquí son amables. Al parecer también puedes mandar dinero aquí y cambiar cheques (no e usado esos servicios yo pero e visto lo hacen) totalmente te recomiendo comprar tus carnes aquí.</Review>

<review>NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY. I got my ears pierced here and they made me pay 40 dollars for a simple lobe piercing that's usually less elsewhere! Do your research and ask them before you get anything done. They are EXTREMELY VAGUE and will overcharge you!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< UserId.>

The guy who did the piercing was super friendly, communicated what he was doing as it was happening which was reassuring, had a relaxing way of talking, and the piercing came out great!

I went to get a belly ring done and it was done uneven and crooked. I had to take it out and get it redone once the first one closed. The piercing guy was nice and it was clean but my piercing wasnt good.< /review>

Got my tongue web pierced at a different shop and the ball fell off. Went to the closest place to me which was primos. Turns out I had a defective piece of Jewelry and my prior piercer had completely pierced me wrong. Anyways he helped me change it out and I’m really thankful and will now be going there for all my piercing needs.<//text>

We had an appointment to get a piercing at 1pm and we finally just gave up and left at 1:45 because the piercing guy never even bothered to show up. We were told when we walked in that he was on his way and would be there in 5 minutes.</review>

Excellent customer service, friendly, courteous, and professional.  The estimated time was accurate, and they notified me when my car was almost ready, just a car wash to finish.  The work order was clear and concise and I was not charged more than the estimate.  Nice comfortable waiting room.  I was very pleased with my experience and will get all my Nissan maintenance there.  Highly recommended.   : )</text>

I would like to thank Thomas, Tommy & Chris for working with me to replace my 2010 F150. At first I looked at a 2020 Jeep Gladiator, I wasn’t sure if it was big enough for us compared to the F150, so Thomas suggested we take it home overnight and see if it fits our lifestyle. He said you should see if it will work out for you and your wife.
After the overnight test drive we realized it was a bit too small for our needs so I took the Gladiator back and asked him to look for a RAM Crew Cab (similar to F150). He was able to locate one at another of their dealerships in Vacaville. Chris went to Vacaville and grabbed it the same day. Tommy, Thomas and I quickly came to a screaming deal and I had my new RAM REBEL Crew Cab.
This is my third time working with Thomas and NB Nissan in the last 5 years and they have always made it painless.
Thanks guys!< /text>

This is what happened to me: So my nissan car broke down and i took it to this dealership for diagnosis (i've been told that it had timing chain issue when i took it for oil change before) but i took my car (towed) to make sure that if it was timing issue or something else and fix. Initially the service people told me there would be $150 charge for diagnosis and i agreed but after a day after a mechanic worked and on my car and they told me LABOR was $900 for diagnose and charged me with no authorization (see attached pics) and to release my car. and also never put those parts they took out, they wanted charge more if they wanna install back (which is against law tho) and my ac freon was empty, i had to pay again to get it worked. Such a bad dealership i've ever visited in my life, i owned 3 cars but never had bad experience like this, btw this is my 1st review in my life (finally decided to write review and help people to stay away from these ripping company).</Text>

I’ve been meaning to write this review for almost two weeks now. ERIC in the service department was so good! He took care of me and went above and beyond. I can’t say enough good things about this gentleman. This is the true definition of customer satisfaction. When I had called Santa Rosa they were rude and hung up in my face or didn’t answer half of the time. I came in because I was having a problem with my windows automatically rolling down and my break light being out. Eric is one of the guys who plays a vital role in the office. He’s a pro! Thanks Eric for going above and beyond for my vehicle and it’s needs.</review>

I dealt with a pushy online salesman that wouldn't follow through and do what he said he was going to do, which was to send me a price quote, but then kept sending me follow up emails asking me when I wanted to come in. I asked again for a quote, he said he had thought he sent me one, but then he looked and verified that no he hadn't and 'oh yeah the monthly payment was somewhere in the high 700s.' I asked again for an actual quote before I drove all the way in from San Jose, and so he calls me. He asked me if I was going to come in to buy the truck that day if he got me a price, I said I don't know I live far away and would like to know the price before I commit to anything. He again said he would get me a quote, but even still didn't send me one. I followed-up a day and a half later and he ignored my text message. So, I made another online request through the website several days later hoping to get a different salesperson to respond, as I am actually really looking to buy a truck, and my second request through their website has now gone unanswered for several days. How is this dealership so highly rated? High pressure to commit without any real details and without giving any customer service or having integrity to follow-through on one's word.</text>

I have a 2007 Nissan Maxima that I just recently bought. I figured I would take it in to find out if there were any pressing issues since I plan to drive the car for about 6 months or so and then buy a new car. I explained all of this to the person in the service department. I clearly stated that the check engine light had come on and I simply wanted to only address what was causing that issue and find out if there was anything else that absolutely needed to be done right away. Long story short, it was clear that the Service Department wanted to get every dollar from me that they could. They presented me with over 11,000 worth of work and most of it was labeled as "critical". I found this very deceptive and decided to simply pay for my diagnostic and move on. I will get the work done eventually but not at Nissan.</Text>

Everyone was very helpful, I had lots of trucks to choose from, Marco spent a great deal of time making sure I got a truck I was looking for at a price I could afford. Because they have several dealerships I can't imagine they don't have the vehicle that you're looking for. Ozzie and the rest of the team make your buying experience a pleasant one.</text>

I was delighted with my car buying experience at Northbay Nissan. Jose & Ryan were both professional and informative. I really appreciated all of the effort they put in to making sure that the paperwork process was thorough and efficient. In the months leading up to purchasing my 2020 Nissan Kicks, every staff member at NBN took the time to answer every question under the sun to put my mind at ease. These employees include Jason, Nick, Eric, Kevin, & Juan. Each of these kind people did not bat an eye when I came to them with a question (or fifty) on multiple occasions. I cannot express how much I appreciate everyone involved who went out of their way to guide me along the path to new car ownership. Thank You!!!</review>

I utilized the service department to have my Altima diagnosed when I was having electical/battery issues. Even though I live in Santa Rosa, after a poor experience at the Santa Rosa dealership, and a great experience at North Bay Nissan, I chose to have work done at the Petaluma location. My technician was Hyram, and he was very communicative with the issue and gave great time and cost estimate during the process. They also sanitized my car after working on it and washed it as well. Thank you for the positive experience.<//Text>

< Review>
Juan Padilla is so wonderful. I have been a loyal customer to Northbay Nissan for over 25 years. I have bought 2 cars there and sent customers in there to do the same. Randy Tong was my first contact there and he took care of me for years. Juan and I have the same relationship. He makes sure my car is safe and well cared for. I depend on honest, dependable, fair priced advice. He is a real asset to your company. When he recently departed from your company, I started looking for an alternative solution to my automobile service options. I am so glad he is back. Relationship with customers is key to your success.< /Review>

Sold me a "lifetime"  anti theft Karr Track system for $1,250. Turns out it was only good for 3 years. Then continued to drain my car battery for many years trying to constantly connect to a service that was discontinued without notification. Both North Bay Nissan and Karr tracking have changed owner ship and can't validate their contracts. buyer beware

Already called and I was informed you no longer have access to my contract as you are now under new ownership.</Text>

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!

Jason Ramirez has been the worst staff member I have ever worked with. I had purchase a car back in early May of 2020 and I requested a cancellation on my warranty on October 2020 and have followed up many times and he has absolutely ignored ALL my calls and ALL my emails. I talked to Jose in the same department after Jason has fully ignored me and he was going to help but it is now February 2021 and I have heard nothing from either of them. Very disappointed. It seems like it is hard to get to higher management to file a complaint. Worst dealership to work with.</Text>

It started off rough with them.  The original car I wanted was sold even though I was told it was in hold for me.  I was very disappointed, but Marco called and asked if he could try and find me something close to the car I wanted.  He did find me something which I was thankful for.< /Review>

we had a bad experience with the finance department. It would be awesome if we could atleast get in touch with the people in the finance about our car trade in and registration. We call them thousands of time, never get to speak with, or even we leave our message, we won't get call back from them. I am thankful that we got our car from them but very disappointed with the ratings i see about the dealership because we never got a good customer service as expected.<//review>

I called and schedule to have a recall completed on my 2017 Nissan Versa. Showed up at appointment and service advisor stated it should take no more than 1 hour. I elected to stay until service advisor stated that a leak was found from the Engine main seal at 25k miles. They offered a rental car while my car was being repaired. Next Day my versa was ready for pickup. Picked up car next day, found a mechanics tool on the passenger floorboard and drove back and gave tool to service advisor. Next day found a misc. screw in the cup holder, couldn't find where the screw came from. Fast forward 3,000 miles after replacement of engine main seal and oil change. Drained oil and found that only 2.5 Qts. of oil was in the engine while capacity per owners manual is 3.75 Qts. Disappointed in service department. Will take car elsewhere.</Text>

<text>HORRIBLE experience here with the service manager. I will never purchase any other vehicle from Northbay Nissan after they cost me over $700 in rental fees and left me without a car for 3 weeks! I dropped my car off on Monday November 9th for maintenance or repair that required the car to stay overnight. Due to the fact it was still under manufactures warranty, Juan the service manager had let me know that my car would be repaired at the Chevy dealership down the road and that they would be contacting me the next day, also adding the Chevy dealership would be taking care of the rental reimbursement. As he is the professional who does this for a living and im just a customer, I took him for his word. That was a mistake. It took me calling Juan a few days later to receive an update on my vehicle that I had left in his possession and he naturally blamed the guy at Chevy and gave me a phone number to call for info instead of doing it himself. After a week passed I still had no real updates or any idea as to what was going on with my car. The 2nd week came and i finally received news that my car was being looked at and would possibly be repaired within the week and was told I'd have a definite answer the next day which didn't happen. Going on week 3 i was finally told my car was ready for me to pick up after I called times this morning... This is NOT how you treat people especially paying customers!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<UserId.>115389458104309828963</UserId.><text>Had an appointment schedule several days in advance. Was told the operation would last 3 1/2 hours so spent money on a Lyft. After only 45 minutes received a call saying there was no part so they ordered one, and I would have to come pick my car up and bring it back the next day. After my car was fixed the next day, I got home only to realize there was a deep scratch on my hood. Had to come back a third time to show the scratch only to be lied to that it didn’t happen there and that there was nothing they would do. Extremely unhappy with the experience. If I had the time I would be seeing you guys in court.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Nick in Service was amazing. After my service visit he followed up with both Nissan central and me to find a much better solution to my problem. My glowing review has less to do with the successful outcome and more to do with the time and attention that Nick put into it. I appreciate the extra effort and attention. Thanks Nick!< /review>

<Text>Have had such a horrible experience here. I purchased a truck and it turned out it was missing the mats. After over a month of calling and contacting 4 different people I was able to get them. Had a terrible time with Jose who provided us with false information and had to go multiple times to resolve the issue. I tried contacting Andrew to get help and all he did was forward me to other people to solve the issue which to date has not been solved. I have never had such a disappointing service at any dealership or place. I had previously purchased a car there back in 2014 and everyone was kind and attentive and made sure that no false information was provided. Please be careful when purchasing from them and when going through the financing  portion if you get Jose please be extra careful. As for Guy he was nice and courteous while doing business and once contract was signed and we tried to contact him for help he was rude and not willing to help. Jason was nice, however has a really bad follow through. I ask everyone who is going situation like this to not give up and continue to advocate for your-self. It’s people like this that think that they can take advantage of our underserved communities who are in need of a car to work and need financing.< /Text><UserId.>108433098200777921227< /UserId.><resp>None</resp>< Pics>

< Review>
We had a ESP added to our contract after we said we didn't want it.  They had to get the Car from another lot so the paperwork couldnt be finalized until the next day.  We came in and signed the paperwork and it is our fault we didnt read it more closely.  We noticed when we got home and went back the next day to get it removed.  Also, what is the Security Fee?  Our Truck has no Security system.  We were told it pertains to the Dealer and the cost just comes with the Truck?  Be Careful.  Read the fine print and be aware that the Car you want may not be on the Lot.<//Review>

Your service department with Juan Padilla, is by far the best I've experienced in the 50+ years I've been driving. Juan is the main reason I'll always be a customer. If Juan leaves, I'll follow him. North Bay Nissan always has a wonderful inventory selection, and their prices are as fair as you'll find anywhere in the state.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>I had to replace the driver side sun visor.  I pulled in last Wednesday afternoon and was helped quickly.
Only negative was the cost, $300...seems a bit high.

I was very happy with the service provided by Nissan Petaluma. The agent that help me made me feel at ease because my check engine was on and it was unnerving. The agent told me they fixed the computer problem and I felt so relieved and very happy with the agent and technician work to fix my Nissan Rouge Sport.<//text>

<time>1574532084952< /time><Rating>4</Rating><Text>- Took 3 hours to let me know that the rear camera needed to be changed, they did nothing. I believe that fiddling with the camera wiring "fixed" the problem, probably a bad connection.
- They reinstalled the back door handle upside down, I had to change it myself.
- The shuttle was convenient, the driver [Christa?] was most pleasant and accommodating BUT impossible to get a ride back, had to take a Lyft.</Text><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1582215055502, 'text': 'Emmanuel Gps,  Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your experience at North Bay Nissan.

I was treated to snacks and drinks, catered to, every single one of my questions was a "great question!" and Isaac (my sales person) was incredibly knowledgeable about the vehicles I was looking at. He saved me from making the mistake of passing up on the higher trim package and not getting the seat warmers, remote start - the things I ACTUALLY USE every day... all from my barely mentioning that I have a severe medical reaction to the cold! Everyone from the receptionist to the Finance guy (Jose) were incredibly helpful. Jose and Hasan were even able to find me financing at 13% lower than what I had! I went from 19.94% to 6.97%!!! This dealership is literally saving me more than $10k at the end of paying off my car - opposed to the car I traded in!</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Nick was great. They came and picked up my car for an oil change. I called and told them that the car had been making a noise when turning. They checked it out and found the front Transfer case seal was leaking. I have an extended warranty. So Nick made the call, then after everything was arraigned for repairs, had a rental car delivered to me.
I originally had a coupon for the oil change, Nick actually found one $20 less expensive!
They washed and vacuumed my car before bringing it back to me.
The only thing that could have made this better is if they had actually shampooed the carpet in the car. Lol
I’m very satisfied with the service I received.

February 2021
Nick comes through again. I can’t say enough about Northbay Nissan. The fact that they come and pick up my car, and after finding out that they were going to have it for more time than expected, Nick made the arrangements with Enterprise for a rental that I said I wanted. Northbay then came and picked me up and took me to Enterprise. They also dealt with the rental agreement and payment through my extended warranty. All I had to do was sign and drive. When my car was done, I picked up my car, (washed and vacuumed), and they called Enterprise to get the rental.
My mom has been thinking, (and kinda looking) for a new car for the past couple years. But can’t really decide what she wants.
But she said that she is thinking about looking into getting a car from Northbay Nissan because of the great customer service that I have been getting since I bought my (used car, not from them), and started having it serviced there.
The only negative thing I have to say about this last visit is with the girl in the service Dept. who helps with taking payments. Not friendly at all. She was last person to deal with, didn’t respond to me and didn’t even say goodbye. Don’t know her name, first time I’ve seen her. Short dark hair and glasses. Sorry to say something. But everyone else there is so nice. It’s a shame to have that one person...<//Review>

There was a part that failed the test and no one checked to see if wanted it replaced.  It’s a $10 fix.  When I emailed in about it it took a week or kore for a ‘real’ follow up and then a month has gone by now and still no one actually contacted me about the problem.  This is way below the service level I have had in the past and is the worst customer service I have ever had there.  The last two vehicles I had purchased were from you and now I am rethinking that and looking for a new place to service my vehicle.< /text>

My brother and I bought a vehicle from Manny Flores in the sales department. He took his time and showed us all his cars. My brother didn't like any. Manny said he had more dealerships in Vacaville so he drove us over there to look at their vehicles. We found a great priced 2018 TOYOTA CAMRY SE LOADED!!! We drove it back to Petaluma and bought the car. Jose Chavez in finance was super friendly and professional. He got me the best APR and got me financed with A GREAT BANK !! Highly recommend buying cars here. Excellent customer service! Will send my friends and family!< /review>

<Text>Purchased my F150 from North Bay Nissan in early November 2019.... Still have yet to receive my registration or title that I had the car paid off for. The finance department is impossible to get ahold of, I have left multiple messages over many issues throughout the process of making multiple payments to pay off my truck...
Now I'm sitting here almost 90 days later with no title or registration.
I've been sent to the DMV for myself to check on where the title and registration is instead of the dealership taking care of this issue that they themselves created....
I also sent certified letter to cancel my warranty and get reimbursed... left a voicemail with finance to get this to no avail.< /Text>< pics>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>These folks did one round service, all handled pretty well and even give me a car to use while the car was being worked on.
This time, brought in a coupon to buy a deal of 5 oil changes for 199.99. Expires today. They wouldn't honor it, had to use the first time doing an actual oil  change. Waited for the service manager, who never came out of her hole. Told a minion, that the car had to be in for service.
Silly restrictions, silly rules, they lost 200 sale, opportunity to wow us for 5 more visits.... Instead: they've lost a customer.

<Review>I went to Nissan looking for a used car. They helped me find a great car and they answered all of my questions. They were patient yet thorough. I bought the car and it has been great. I am so grateful for this experience. I don't understand the bad reviews, this place is great and the process was very smooth. Everyone here is very nice. I will recommend this place to anyone looking for a car.<//Review>< Pics>

Guy Crosbie is, by far, the best car salesman we have had the experience in working with. We always recommend people we know to Guy for cars. Guy stands apart from others because he listens to the needs of his customers, respects the budget available, and communicates clearly and honestly what he can and cannot deliver. His goal is to keep his customers satisfied with their car purchase and build a relationship. Guy has an incredible network of car experts from body work, to mechanics, etc. He is our go to guy with anything we need regarding our cars. You cannot go wrong with working with Guy Crosbie - that is for sure.< /text>

North bay Nissan gave me the best experience  I’ve ever had when buying a car. Not only are they genuine people but they actually listen to what you want and try to get you the best deal possible. I personally was helped by Jose who did an excellent job in getting us what we wanted. My family and I ended up purchasing 3 cars within the same month because we just loved how fast, easy, and great these deals were. I would definitely recommend anyone looking for a new car to visit North bay Nissan and if you’re a Spanish speaker definitely ask for Jose!!!< /text>

Great customer service. Bruce was a great help. I told him the car I wanted to get and he helped me get that exact car. And made sure I didn’t pay more then what I wanted to. I still needed to make sure I could afford the monthly payments. Financing worked with me in doing just that. I now am a proud owner of a Nissan Rouge. Could not be happier with my buy. North Bay Nissan has yet to disappoint.<//text>

<review>My husband and I went into Nissan and found a car we liked. Told the salesman we wanted to look at a few other places first. A couple of days later we decided to get the car at Nissan. We called the salesman and he said the car is still there he would get it ready. When we got there he showed us the car....right away I felt something was different but he reassured me it was the car we drove. Went inside to sign the papers and noticed this car had 18000 more miles than the one we drove. They assured us it was the right car and we were wrong about the miles. After a while the salesman decided to tell us they had sold the car we drove  and he was trying to pass off a different car than the one we wanted. We were very disappointed and will never shop there again.< /review>< pics>

From the moment I walked onto the North Bay Nissan lot, I knew it was different from any lot I'd been on before. I was greeted warmly, treated fairly, and left happy as the proud owner of a Nissan Leaf.  I wanted an S model, and I was told about $11,500 in incentives still available on the 2018 Leaf. I had a question and both the finance manager and general manager came out to make sure I had every question answered. The atmosphere was friendly and unhurried, I never felt pressured or hurried. The staff was uniformly kind and helpful, and they explained everything clearly.  The entire process was a pleasure, and everything I hoped buying a car could be, but didn't think possible. My sales person Devon, was a gem.  Special shout out to Christie for her help as well.  I can't speak highly enough of North Bay Nissan, and I am thrilled they got me into the car of my dreams.< /review>

<Review>The sales man was a really nice and friendly  with us. He was really helpful at the time to pick up the right car and with all the credit stuff. The only bad experience was the cleaning part. The guy left some dirty spots in the car.<//Review>< Rating>

Bought the truck I've been wanting for years. Took it to North Bay Nissan for routine maintenance. Fast and friendly from start to finish. They found a few minor issues and we're quick to let me know that it's all under warranty. Didn't pressure me for the most expensive service. Told me the things that should be done and said the others could wait. Shuttle service available which comes in handy. Until they do me wrong, trusting this truck to North Bay Nissan.</text>

I have had always a good experience at Nissan when I take my car for service. That is the reason I continue to take my car there.

I bought a car here in May and had to turn around and drive back because they messed up paperwork. It's been 90 days since we purchased our vehicle and I registration is up and we have yet to receive our paperwork. The DMV has informed me that they have yet to do their part. Do not buy from this company they are scammers. We have yet to receive any help from this Corporation of Nissan with this problem. So we are paying for a vehicle we cannot drive.</review>

<text>For inspecting the car, changing brake fluid and the fluid for the windshield wipers, over 300 is a bit steep. If as a business you are going to wash a car as a perk, at least do a decent job. I bought my Leaf there and have been taking it for service there as well from the beginning, but I am going to sgoo around for the next time the car needs service. I had a paper with 20%off, but it did.not help me since I tend to forget to be carrying papers with me. It should have been a discount that it is on your system, having to show a piece of paper is not practical.<//text></record></dataset><record>

1. Their staff did not take me seriously as a buyer and would not budge on the listed price of 2017 Chrystler. I felt that they did not respect me as a potential buyer.

2. After running a credit check they would not tell me what my credit was. I estimated that it was ~680 but after another check from my credit union I found that I was at about 730. "You're not any lower than 680" was their exact words.

3.They attempted to screw me on an auto loan since I wasn't pre-approved at the time. Attempted to lock me into a 7 year payment plan with a high interest rate. Would have cost me nearly twice the cost of the actual car by the end of 7 years.

4. They would not explain what was in their service package and tried to push it at every turn regardless of the fact that the car was still under the factory warranty.

5. Very, very pushy.

For these reasons and many more, I cannot recommend this place to anyone. Shop around, you can find a better deal almost anywhere else.

Do. Not. Shop. Here.< /text>< pics>

I cane in research of my first new car. I didn’t know if I was going to qualify for it, and I honestly didn’t know what was going to happen. Thankfully the Nissan Representatives were very polite, helpful and their main focus was to meet MY needs on what I wanted for a car, instead of trying to oversell me a vehicle, just for a commission. I feel well taken cared of and I was guided on the entire process the ENTIRE TIME!! I left with a vehicle 2018 Nissan Rogue within the same day!!

Thank you guys for all your support!!<//Text>

Don't go near this car dealer. I traded in a car that was financed and they never paid off the other loan. Now two loans show up on my credit report and I cant get the refi loan on my house that I need. After calling the finance dept many times my sales rep suggested I call the person who processes the paperwork. I called and she is no longer there. Receptionist said they were bought out. She gave me a name to call, that number told me to call nissan, the ones who just gave me the other number!<//text>

Went in wanting to trade a "lemon" for a same model year or newer and as the sales associate was pleasant his higher up so called manager continued to try to bully us women into buying a brand new car with higher payments and spending more which was the complete opposite of my asking... Then when I said I needed to call my husband he then asked me that if he was able to lower the monthly payments if I would just agree and sign without speaking to my husband. Never again!!!! Manly will have all my future business!!< /Text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I’m very happy with my experience at North Bay Nissan.  I showed up to see a car late on Sunday. The first guy I saw inside was Ron.  He greeted me and offered my kids some hot chocolate.  I told Ron, I was gonna be a nightmare because my credit was bad, I need financing and I wanted to trade in my car that still had a large loan balance.  Ron said, no problem we can find a way to make it happen and we went to look at the car.  The first offer they gave me was the high KKB trade in value.  Financing was gonna be a little harder because my credit has gone down hill over the past years.  A dark skin gentleman from the finance department messed around with the numbers and every bank one said, yes.  In the meantime I took the car for a test drive and everything went smooth.  They ended up dropping the price for my new car and raising the trade in value twice to get me financed.  These guys worked hard crunching numbers and negotiating with the banks until one accepted to finance me.  I got more for my trade and they came down on the price for my new car.  These guys worked hard to get me into my car.  My situation truly was a nightmare but these guys made me feel comfortable.  Kevin helped me through papers signing process quickly and I took the car that night with a promise to bring them a paystub the next day.  Overall it was a great experience and they got it done.<//review>< Pics>

Guy, who was my sales assistant, was Awesome!!! Along with the guys behind the black windows...😁
They worked tirelessly to get the monthly I needed, it took some work but they did it. They went above and beyond all they did.
I have, and will continue to refer people to North Bay Nissan.
Thanks North Bay</review>

<text>I went to get my airbags replaced at this location because there was a recall on the airbags of my Sentra. Service was fast and they found out I needed a new battery which they replaced as well for a good price in the same visit. They even washed my car at the end of the service and signed me up for email offers, which I didn’t even know they did so that was great. Only thing I didn’t like about the place is when we walked into the service center there wasn’t really anyone around so we were standing around for a while wondering who to talk to. I was getting another car serviced earlier that week at another dealership and there was plenty of people around so maybe I’m just basing it off that experience. But overall I’d say, I would return to this location for any of my Nissan services in the future and recommend others do the same.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x8085b4f8fa8d03f7:0xa89c0539be083912< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>These folks are wonderful to deal with! They had the Pathfinder my wife wanted; we traded our 2013 for a new 2018. They made the experience painless and fast. I new what we wanted; on a busy Friday afternoon they put everything together and I was out of there in less than two hours ! Devyn Nunez, the salesperson was thoughtful and knowledgeable. Thomas the Sales manager and Kenny in F&I were pleasant and efficient. The important thing is the new Pathfinder is a much improved car; we love it. Thanks Northbay Nissan!</text>< Rate>

<review>The North Bay Nissan team is very professional, supportive, and they care about the customers. The general manager Mr. Andy Kubichek was very helpful and supportive during the fire disaster time and allowed our animal rescue organization borrow their van in case of emergency evacuation for our special needs cats. I greatly appreciate the North Bay Nissan team and their caring and professional attitude.<//review>< Pictures>

We visited this dealer after in contact with Christy Cook. Our intention on that day is just to have a look at the Chevy Impala. Christy had arranged everything for us. We were surpised and impressed of the way we were served on that day. We love the car that we took for a test drive and within an hour we struck a deal with the dealer and we signed everything right there and then. If you ever visit this dealer, make sure to check out Christy and their manager by the name of Kenny. They're of great help in choosing the right car and the financing of your vehicle.

Thank you Kenny & Christy.< /Text>

This last visit was not good...I brought my car in for tire pressure light on and having to add air to one tire, and an oil change. When I picked it up I was told nothing wrong with tire (said checked for nails but not sure if that meant it was fully tested for leak in valve and tire or just physically looked at for nails) or sensors ...but if light came in again in a week take it to a tire specialist. The light was on when I drove away. And when I pulled into gas station a few miles away the tire was low.

I didn't take it back as I had an urgent appointment to go to. It felt like the oil change was done but whatever was or was not done around tire pressure and light was not good work.

Also, I used to not be charged for a rental when my car was in shop. Now I am. Whether I am charged seems to be up to the rep I am working with and since the guy that used to help me was promoted the new reps I get always charge me.

Been a fan a long time but very disappointed. I'm fighting a flu bug now but I  will take my car elsewhere to get tire replaced when I'm better ecause obviously it is leaking ...I have had to add air every day. ..Light on every day.  Not sure how they let me drive off saying it was ok when it clearly isn't. Did not give me confidence in my safety.<//Text>

Joel Wandner is a great sales person. Best sales experience I've had. Dealership is good and management seems solid and works like a  team. Not high pressure sales, but thorough and very good service! I love my new car.

Randy was my guy. I needed a car right away, got the clearence model at a steal. No haggling, straight forward. The experience was actually very positive. I wasn't looking forward to it and came away with a new perspective. They made me a loyal customer. Can't say the same for their neighbour....complete opposite experience.

I also upaet that i had to call 3 times this week to get a call from service man to see when part was coming in amd when to schedule appointment.  The lack of service is getting worse.  I spend lots of money at this location and now i will be looking for new mechanics and new place to buy a car for the future. The service manager Matt is not helpful at all!<//review>< pictures>

<text>I was thrilled with the level of service provided by your sales person, Jose Chavez. He found the vehicle I wanted at a price I could afford in under 48 hours. I looked at dealerships in my hometown of Napa, and did not receive anywhere near the professionalism, courtesy, or willingness to assist, as I did with Jose.

I love my xTerra! Thank you, Jose!<//text>< rating>

Wonderful place, wonderful  people. I bought my car from them a few years ago. Would rather go to them for an oil change than some private owned shop. Wonderful customer service by many a few I would like to mention by name, "Missy Oden, Monica Padilla, Loni Green, Ryan Burton, (Ron in the front), (Steve in service department)" .</text>

I just want to thank everyone at North Bay Nissan that worked so hard to get me the 2018 Rogue that I wanted. I would definitely buy from them again and I highly recommend North Bay Nissan to anyone that is looking to purchase a new or used vehicle. Especially first time buyer's like myself!!</text>

<review>I have a bumper to bumper warranty on my vehicle including electrical. There was an issue with some of the control buttons on the steering wheel. I took it in and after two and a half hours was given back my vehicle.

When I went to drive it off the lot it felt like the emergency brake was on even though it wasn't. Somehow the mechanics messed up the drivetrain. They had to keep it overnight. However I was going out of town for 4 days. I had been given a rental car until repairs were completed.

I actually purchased this car from North Bay Nissan Less Than 3 months ago I have yet to receive tag renewal stickers and I'm driving on expired tags. I was told that the registration paperwork given me attached to the windshield would be good for 90 days.
I'm on day 83.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Out of about 5 Nissan dealerships that we went to, this is the only one that wasn't scummy and gross. In fact, this dealership is on par with high end dealerships, clean, friendly, courteous, and all around a good experience. My wife and I bought a car from here, more specifically, Ron, and he was an absolute pleasure to work with.<//review>

Disappointed. I normally rate this business highly but my most recent experience made me reconsider. I was told I needed over $800 in repairs to replace the radiator hoses & thermostat due to a leak. I looked very carefully around the hoses and thermostat cover assembly and there is no evidence of a leak. Maybe a mix up with another customer’s car?<//Review>

Had a great experience working with Marco Arango at North Bay Nissian in Petaluma.  No pressure, helped me negotiate a reasonable price, and got the deal done!  I highly recommend giving Marco a call if you’re in the market for a new or used vehicle.  They have more than Nissians available, great staff and comfortable environment.</Text>

I have nothing but great things to say about my experience at North Bay Nissan.  I purchased a Murano from Mark Brill and the experience was smooth from beginning to end.  Mark was very helpful and gave me options and things to consider before I jumped in and made my purchase!  I never felt pressured and truly felt like Mark and North bay Nissan in general put my best interest at the top of the priority list.  I would, without a doubt, recommend seeing Mark Brill at North Bay Nissan, even if you are only considering a car purchase!</review>

<gmapID>0x8085b4f8fa8d03f7:0xa89c0539be083912<//gmapID><review>I was extremely impressed with my experience at North Bay Nissan. I purchased a used Sentra from them.  I was treated professionally the moment I walked into the dealership and was helped right away. They listened to me and to my needs and found a vehicle within my budget, did not try to upsell me on something out of my budget. On top of that, they knew that I was in a rental car, needed to get out of that conract quickly so they expedited the prep of the Sentra to get it to me as soon as possible. Greatly appreciated that. In terms of customer and dealership experience, it was top notch.  Bill Martin who sold us the car constantly communicated with me, returned my phone call right away when I had a question. Comfortable environment at dealership, they took care of my family and I while we are attended to, even complimentary tea and coffee while we were waiting in the lobby! They just get it.  Found out from one of my employees that he has purchased two cars from North Bay Nissan and was extremely satisfied as well...now I know why.  I will be back to purchase my next vehicle from this dealership.</review>< userid>

WARNING!!!! Worst experience I’ve ever had purchasing anything. Cutthroat sales tactics!!  I would avoid this place at all cost. If they have a vehicle you absolutely must have stay away from the salesman Ron. He was extremely shady and I am in shock that a dealership of this caliber allows the methods he uses.< /text>

If it wasn't for their DMV clerk who placed a lien holder on a car I paid cash for, refused to talk to me and then lied about correcting the problem and 6 months later it only got corrected because of their amazing office manager I would have rated them higher. Also, numerous messages left for the general manager regarding this problem and he never called me back. The service center does a great job, but because of the DMV clerk and no return calls from their general manager I will never buy a car from them again and would not recommend doing business with them.</review>

<Text>Would not recommend using Northbay Nissan. Horrible experience from start to finish.  I feel bait and switch techniques were used during the sale, and I should have just walked away. Aside from that, they have terrible  communication. I purchased a vehicle on September 21, and it is now November 5th and my trade in loan has still not been paid off by Northbay Nissan. I have called multiple times and am basically told they will look into it and call me back. I have yet to receive a call back from them. Buy a vehicle somewhere else!!!!! Save yourself the headache<//Text>< pictures>

Deceptive. Tires thinner than specified and not actually checked.Finance officer informed me Nissan had no service contracts available. Incorrect. Nissan specifically excludes electric and hybrid vehicles from their certified pre-owned warranty. This indicates Nissan itself knows major problems within 7 years or 100,000 miles for these vehicles. This information is hidden and not easily found.< /review>

< Review>
Pre sales service has been great at Northbay Nissan., they jump through hoops and reply quickly to customer inquiries.  Post sales however sucks..  I Am trying to get them. I feel like I’m begging, asking for favors..when I’m simply asking to follow through and accomplish what’s  promised..the response is slow and deliberate..the attitude is “ok we’ve got your money and we’re done with you, will get back to you whenever”

Very typical and annoying< /Review>

<text>The phones and service dept. Are very slow to respond to phone calls.  On hold three times to find out if our daughter's car was ready for pick up.  The 3rd. Call we were hung up on.  Drove to dealership without any info to pick up the car.  One person. Working in the service dept. Was very backed up with other customers.  While inside the dealership there were plenty of other employees standing around talking with each other.  They deffently need help in the service area.  Finally after saying something Matt a service person was very helpful and curious.<//text>< Pictures>

The only time I've been happy to spend $1500... These guys did a great job repacking my hubs, fixing my cv axle, and changing my brakes and rotors. When I had questions about the wear on my brakes and the torn cv boot, Randy (service manager) brought me into the shop with my car on the lift and showed me what they had found. Very friendly, very honest, very efficient. My car even got a complimentary bath.<//Text>

<Review>I went in to Nissan with my fiance Jeremiah Otten on Veterans Day weekend. Had a horrible salesman and a really bad experience. Left unhappy with a mediocre car and a very high payment. My fiance called Devin whom he just bought a car from the weekend before. Not only was Devin able to help me but he got me out of my contract and put me in a car that I absolutely love. Devin is amazing he goes above and beyond to make sure that you are happy. I couldn't be happier and I had a much better buying experience. Thank you Devin for all that you did for me.</Review><time>1510940535996<//time><gmap_id>0x8085b4f8fa8d03f7:0xa89c0539be083912<//gmap_id>< user_name>

After purchasing a (new) car (hybrid Altima) from North Bay Nissan a few years ago, they will definitely be the place that I also purchase my next car. Not only do I still love the car, but the staff was very friendly, didn't go in for the hard-sell, and will try and work with you to get a fair deal on a trade-in. The manager even helped me customize the look of my car a bit (grill and rims), and I still have random people complementing me on it to this day! I bring my car in to get serviced there, too, and have always been very satisfied by their attention to detail, thoroughness, and fair prices. Even though the infrastructure is in its infancy, their all electric car (the Leaf) is really tempting, and is on my short list of new cars I'd like to drive home from their lot!</review>

<text>Guy was one of the worst sales men. Super rude. Talked down to me because of my age despite the fact that i was getting a car in my own. Told us on multiple occasions to wait “five minutes” And then proceeded to take over 20 minutes each time. He also did not communicate anything with us. We came to the lot with questions, and instead of saying yes or no, he sort of left them open in hopes of getting a better sale. He also said something along the lines of the people who come in trying to buy a car usually lie about what they’re looking for or want in a car, insinuating that that is what I was doing, insinuating that I was lying. That is not something you should do to your customers. I will probably never be buying another car from this dealership.< /text>< user_name>

I never thought I would be so thankful for someone to treat me poorly as they did at Jim Bone Nissan which lead me to North Bay Nissan. Not only did I walk away with a much better car the Nissan Sentra with better options at almost the same as I was quoted on for the Nissan Versa from Jim Bone. Then to be treated with such kindness and like I mattered that's what I call enjoying it while I spend my money because I was treated ever so kindly from the whole staff.< /Review>

I walked in and nobody was at the reception desk I stood there for 5 min waiting to be greeted and nothing. I had to ask someone sitting at his desk on his break for help. He got me Bruce and he basically told me because you are not buying a car today I cant help you I work on commissions plus my manager is not going to like to waste his time getting estimates. So he went back to his office and let me looked at closed cars in the lot!! I was there to do research on the best option /deal for me and wanted to see a few cars from the inside. Also to find out about a lease on the Rogue Sport but he didn't even have it. So they don't appreciate my business just because I wanted to do research first buying or leasing a car needs to be an informed decision. Therefore I will not come back!!  Terrible customer service !!!</text>

Outstanding customer service and very knowledgeable staff.  After living without a car for over three years I finally decided that it was time to upgrade.  I went to North Bay Nissan with an idea of the type of car I wanted and Joel helped me with the rest.  I cannot thank him enough.  Would definitely recommend!<//Text>

I tried buying a car from North Bay Nissan, it's been difficult. I started the process on Sunday, today is Tuesday and nothing. I called, knew exactly what I wanted, and we agreed to a price. Hours later, the numbers change, what was agreed is no longer valid. Still, I want the car. I tell them I will get a ride there, I just need to know for certain what we are agreeing to. I haven't heard back from them. I asked if they could provide shuttle service from SFO, no response. I don't know how they do business with others, but my experience has been difficult to and non-responsive. They advertise the lowest prices in the area, but good luck nailing them down.<//Text>

I am so disappointed today because of what I heard from north bay Nissan i bought suburban suv from them 2 month a go included bumper to bumper coverage for Business and they told me my commercial plat will be ready in 2 month but never show up until today so I went there today early but  they DMV department said I have to wait one more month. it's ok I can wait but I was worry if I don't receive in one month I am not able to drive this car also I will keep losing mony because I can't work with car also  I canceled my bumper to bumper coverage today because I tray two time to fixed my car with this coverage they are so complicated they didn't even fixed long history but they are not good.</Text>

Before coming here I was nervous about buying a car and getting screwed over. As soon as I walked in I was greeted and helped by Gabby! Whom I highly recommend to go if you need help!! She is very nice and patient and made sure I was going to leave with a great car and with a great deal at that. After browsing and analyzing , I decided to buy the Nissan Altima and I left feeling happy because I got a great deal and a good car. So If you need a car go check out North bay Nissan and go see Gabby! You won't regret it.< /review>< pics>

Devyn was super helpful in all respects from vehicle selection to after-the-sale amenities and service.  This is my third Altima from North Bay Nissan and that’s why I keep coming back.< /text>

<text>Worst Experience I Have Gotten At A Dealership(North Bay Nissan @ 1250 Auto Center Dr, Petaluma,). I Went To Go See A Car(Aprx 7/20/18) And After Driving The Car, We Went Inside To Talk Numbers. Once We Were Inside We Couldn't Agree On The Price So The Manager And Sales Associate Ended Up Showing Me Another Car (Same Year and Model Both Were Certified Similar Mileage). This Car Had Spider Webs and Scratches So I Decided I Didn't Want This Car. After Talking Some More Between The Manager, Sales Associate And I Regarding The Price Of The Original Car I Wanted, The Sales Associate Became Angry And Grumpy. I Asked Him If He Can Tell Me When The Car Was Originally Purchased To Know How Much Of The Warranty It Still Had. I Basically Had To Beg Him To Do It Because He Didn't Want To Check. Soon After He Got Up And Told Me To Leave In A Rude Tone And Walked Away.

The Car I Wanted Has Not Been Sold As Of Today And It's Price Has Dropped To The Price I Asked When I Went In. I Will Not Be Returning To A Place That Doesn't Know How To Treat Customers

My Advice, Go Elsewhere!<//text>< user>

BTW...I had done a lot of internet research prior to going to the lot, so I knew it was a great deal whan they presented it.
David, my sales guy was awesome and the rest of sales team was equally professional.

I had some apprehension towards going to a dealership and purchasing a new car because I've heard (as I'm sure you have) of the horror stories of how sleazy the experience can be. I was fully expecting to "shop" and not purchase a car before I saw all the options out there, but found myself driving away with my new car. I honestly didn't feel the need to go elsewhere, I was very comfortable with how I was treated and was not pressured to make my decision. I did not have to haggle over the price or payment and got exactly what I wanted.
I want to thank Ben and his team for making my first experience a great one.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Looking for a new car, and keep getting drawn back to the Juke.  Called in and spoke with Tony, who was great.  I didn't want to keep him on the phone too long, but he took the time to answer all my questions and a few more.  When I'm ready to buy, I know who I'll be working with!<//review>

I had the best car purchase experience. My dad is so happy that we chose NBN, specially having dealt with Gaby Sayavedra as our sales person. Anyone who needs a car--- don't think twice, go and ask for Gaby.<//Review>

<date>1405701431974</date><Rating>5</Rating><text>I've just started a lease for a Nissan Leaf one week ago. This is the first time I've ever leased a car and this is my first electric car. So far it has been a great experience.

North Bay Nissan was the first stop on my search for an electric car. Guy Crosbie worked with me and my wife explaining the nuances of being an electric car owner and showing what the Nissan Leaf had to offer and it's limitations. We never felt pressured and left feeling very good about the experience. I think Guy knew we were coming back.

We visited a few more dealerships and decided the Leaf was the car for our needs. I called Guy late on a Saturday and he told me to come down. Abel was available to answer some questions to make sure the Leaf would meet my needs, he also owns a Leaf and was very helpful. I got the model and color that I wanted and continued with the sales process. Originally I had intended to buy the car but one of the incentives available for the 2014 model was not available for the 2015 and they were out of 2014's. Guy was very professional with this situation and let me work out the decision with my wife. We worked with Andy in the finance department and he was very helpful. After going through our options and asking a bunch of questions we figured leasing was the better choice. At no point did Andy pressure us in one direction or another and we're very happy with our choice.

Ron's been helping me with figuring out home charging options. He's very knowledgeable and responsive through email. Consistent with the level of service we've experienced at North Bay Nissan.

Depending on a fully electric car for my transportation is a new experience for me. Going through North Bay Nissan has made me more comfortable with my choice.</text>< pics>

Went in looked at an Xtera , went on test drive, was told that it was on special. When the salesman
went to get the price he returned and informed me that it was not on sale. In fact their are only two
of these in the whole United States. And because of that his boss says it s the sticker price .
Walked out bought a nice 4 runner in under two hours at the Toyota store down the street. Paid cash
and was treated well. Go Toyota</text>

Two years ago we bought a used car at this dealership. Today we are selling it and just discovered that the car had an accident. We were not told that while buying the car. The carFax report presented to us at the time did not include that information.< /text>

Salesman left for vaca with 1 day notice, pushed me off to another (who was brought up to speed on my info) but did not honor our appt because he had just taken a walk-in and left me with yet another who knew absolutely nothing about what had been done to date. It was all so ridiculous, I went to another dealer and walked out 3hrs later with my new car. It's really ashame because it's doubtful i will even have my car serviced there in the future.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Gmap_id>

I already knew exactly which car I was getting so it wasn't going to be hard for the sales person to sell me a car. I was coming to buy. The process of buying a car takes way longer then it should considering I had picked out the car before I came. I had to come back the next day and pick it up and my sales person was not there, which I knew but who cares. Another sales person was assigned to run through the features and hand over the keys. I came around the corner to get into the car and it was clean but not dry! Who wants water spots on there brand new car! I said no, dry it off. Upon going over the features testing everything the sun roof broke. So here is where things got out of hand. It took 3 hours to pick up my car that was already paid for. They were not communicating with me about what they were going to go to remedy the situation. I had to hunt someone down and tell me what was happening. Needless to say that was not how I wanted to pick up my new car. To not fault of the sales people they had no idea and especially the sales person the second day.< /Text>

And then when I went into the finance office I was expecting to get pounded like a piece of veal with the undercoat etc  hard sale, but Bill was totally awesome and was sensitive to my vibe that I was really interested in any add ons and just got on with it in a very professional manner , really the best , thanks guys I love my car.And would do business here anytime cheers !< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1523290596432, 'text': 'Thank you!'}< /response><GmapID>0x8085b4f8fa8d03f7:0xa89c0539be083912</GmapID></record>

<review>Bruce Higbie at North Bay Nissan surprised me with his candor and forthright approach.  He had the Pearl White 2014 Altima S that I wanted at an advertised price better than any other dealer would match by two thousand dollars.  The deal was almost done but I changed my mind and moved up a notch and decided to get the SV model with the convenience package, which they did not have.

I absolutely would have purchased my new car from Bruce without question.  After their competitor in Marin found out that they were going to lost my business, they dropped their Internet prices to match North Bay's offer, making North Bay the leader in aggressive pricing and the other dealer a follower who initially said they could not sell me the S Model for less than twenty-one five.

Bruce has  integrity and I highly recommend taking a look at their site.  No pressure or gimmicks here.  Just honest straightforward pricing and negotiating unlike their nearest competitor.

Good luck with your car purchasing endeavors!

I'm going threw a process right now with Nissan with what I think is going to be considered a lemon car. I have an Nissan Altima Hybrid that keeps breaking down about every 5 - 10 some times if your lucky you will make it 20 miles before the care just decides its done driving and shuts off. Leaving you to coast to a safe place.
I brought the car into to the Nissan Dealer ship in Santa Rosa it took them 5 days to get the car back to me, 5 days with no vehicle (they have accommodations but refuse to give them out to customers).
So I get my car back the put 60 miles on my car give it back to me dirty and with a bill of course, which was expected minus the dirty car.
The car lasted about 5 drives around 70 miles and the car decides that what ever Nissan did to it.(nothing but reprogram the computer and bill me) the car didn't like and no refuses to run. I call Nissan back the tell me the can see me in 3 days and refuses to give accommodate me with a vehicle even though I'm stranded with a car load of kids on the way camping and the kids parents were already at the camp site hours away. I tried to call management with no success, first off the will not return calls and if you try to keep calling them they will avoid you until about 445 and then tell you there is nothing the can do for you today its almost 5. You can try to tell them you have been trying to get a hold of them all day, will not make a difference. Now they want to charge me to diagnose and fix a problem that I just paid them to diagnose and fix again. They will try to take your money at Nissan, treat you like garbage, and then when you come back unsatisfied (of course) they will try and send you to one of there competitors.  I will keep every one updated with reviews of my progress with them and the treatment they give there customers.
Please don't reward these crooks with your hard earned cash I spent the time writing this review so you do not also have to learn the hard way as I did.

The manager I spoke with manager Randy in services, don't expect any ethical business from this guy. And the General Manager Ben Hannah doesn't answer his phone or return calls I'm not sure if this guy really exist but if you have a problem he is the guy you need try to get ahold of. its to bad they don't put there home addresses up some were id just go wait on his door step.< /Review>

I have purchased many vehicles, both new and used.  I usually know exactly what I want to buy and pay, and research inventories before I contact dealers.  That was the case with the xTerra Pro that I purchased from North Bay Nissan two weeks ago.  Early on a Monday I called requesting Sales and Bruce took my call.  Told him exactly the vehicle I wanted and requested that we agree on a price quickly over the phone.  We were able to do that with a minimum of calls which I really appreciated.  We then covered a few details, including financing options and other essentials. Bruce also arranged for me to get picked up in San Francisco after I finished work, and in enough time to make the trip to Petaluma before the dealership closed.  These arrangements went perfectly and I arrived about 715p.

Bruce informed  earlier that he would not be working that evening and arranged for Ron to complete the sale and delivery.  The car was cleaned and ready when I arrived.  Ron suggested a quick test drive and then very patiently did a walk-through of all the relevant features and controls.  Ron collected all final details to complete the delivery and financing, and then turned me over to the Finance Manager.    Once I was with the Finance Manager, completing the transaction was quick and painless.

The only downside to the entire transaction was that I had to wait almost an hour and 20 minutes for the Finance Manager to see me.  The date was 9/30 - the end of the month and quarter - and there was only one Finance Manager on duty.  This was really poor planning, especially for a busy sales day.  It was after 10p when i finally left, three hours after arriving.  I had a long drive ahead of me back to San Francisco and work early the next morning.

Bruce and Ron have both called to see how I am enjoying the xTerra and to offer their help if anything needs to be addressed.  The day after the sale I also received a call from the dealership asking for my feedback on the purchase transaction.  This was good follow-up on the sale and very much appreciated.

Bruce and Ron were excellent to work with and I recommend them without reservation .  Even though North Bay Nissan is not at all convenient to San Francisco, I would contact them first if I decide to buy another Nissan.</Review>

This place is a rip off. Be ware we bought a car that was 17000 and they borrowed 25000 from the bank for no reason. When we asked them about it the next day they practically threw us out. The worst service in the auto industry. I've owned 5 nissan and this is the last one. I wanted a maxima next but I'll take a Kia before I take anything from them. Beware of the paperwork. Go with a lawyer if you want to buy a car there.</text>

This dealership is amazing! I was looking for a new Altima 2.5S. When I knew they have the car with exact model/trim/package and color in stock, I began to negotiate the price with the salesman Bruce Higbie and he helped me to get an amazing deal! The deal was too good to be true, so I asked Bruce to make sure I'm qualified for Nissan finance to get this deal before I went there. He was very nice to help me run the credit check and told me I was qualified. Then I told him if they keep this deal for me, I will buy from them. I told him "now you have my words, can I have yours?" He called and told me he will keep his promise, that's a very critical personal quality. So I trusted him and ask my friend to drive two hours to get there.

When I saw Bruce, he was very nice and helpful to make the whole process very smooth. He truly did what he promised for me!!! This "my-word-you-word" thing is so beautiful! Bruce did an excellent example for the other dealers and built my confidence for this dealership system. Then the financial man Andrew Kubichek helped me to set up everything quickly and answered all my questions in great patience and details.

After all things are settled down, Bruce still came with me in the car and showed me how to everything in great detail. This dealership experience totally changed my impression for salesman. I really appreciated Bruce's and Andrew's help! I'm extremely happy with my new car!

Thanks a lot!< /Review>

<review>I never take the time to write reviews but the level of satisfaction with Northbay Nissan is more than I expected it to be, Everyone is friendly making you feel welcome, I purchased my Nissan Sentra from them and they're the only ones that handle the oil changes and any other services I need to get done, The staff are always professional and fast, The day I got my car they kept checking on us making sure we were taken care of, The financial part of it was fast and efficient, I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a professional team and fast, friendly, secure staff that will take care of you ! Good Luck Northbay Nissan and I hope you keep doing a great job !< /review></record></dataset><record>

This is the first time I have not felt pressured at a dealership and the first time I was looking forward to writing a review! I was nervous/skeptical about purchasing/leasing an electric car and both Guy Crosbie and Ron Coury were a great team; they not only answered all my questions, but made me feel comfortable, making my concerns go away. They provided me with a pressure free purchase and took the time to explain the wonders of this crazy electric car. They provided me with awesome service and directed me to all the special incentives as well as electric car websites that I can use from my phone while I am commuting (on the side of the road). Guy spent a great deal explaining all the gadgets and extras in the car while Ron explained all the neat features of the "carwings" as well as the online community when it comes to electric cars. Even when I was signing all the paperwork, Sam (Finance Manager) was awesome! We actually had a real conversation and he didn't try and sell me the normal and famous "old school dealership triple undercoat package."  Needless to say, I am very happy with my experience and would not hesitate to recommend Guy, Ron, Sam, and North Bay Nissan; they do it the right way.</review>

ABOVE AND BEYOND CUSTOMER SERVICE!
Family drove down fron Reno Nevada because we were quoted an out the door price of 1200 dollars less than local delears for the same vehicle. Was met by Joel Wandner (manager) in Internet sales. Joel had us written up for our previously agreed  upon price and out the door in about an hour.  When i was getting the vehicle registered in nevada the DMV said i was missing a piece of paper from the sale.  I called Joel and he overnighted  the documents directly to the DMV so i was able to register the truck.  Outstanding customer service even after the sale.  This is what will keep me coming back to a dealer.</Text>

Terrible company, with terrible service. Our Nissan Xterra's transmission failed at 160,000 miles (bummer but it happens), we purchased a brand new transmission through this dealership with a warrantee. The transmission we received was installed and turned out to be faulty. The check engine light kept coming on and this dealership would clear the code and try and blame the mechanic who installed the transmission. We had to bring our car to our mechanic over ten different times leaving it for multiple days on multiple occasions. For a total of over 10 nights. The mechanic brought the car to the dealership multiple times and also had to we bring the car to the dealership. Throughout this process the dealership did absolutely nothing to compensate for the inconvenience, they did not supply a rental car, rarely returned out phone calls, and never gave anything near an apology. After months of phone calls and bringing our car in they finally did a thorough inspection of the transmission which revealed it was in fact faulty and therefore covered by the warrantee. After which they refused to supply the labor to remove the faulty transmission they supplied, refused to supply labor to install the replacement, and refused to supply a rental car while this took place. They had the nerve to tell us they wasted three hours dealing with warrantee process, while we had months of headaches, hundreds in rental car fees and seemingly never ending frustrations in dealing with this dealership.</text>

After searching for the perfect car for weeks I finally purchased a 2013 Sentra from Randy Trujillo. Not only was Randy extremely kind, friendly but he gave me an amazing deal. No other nissan dealers were able to match the price offered to me at petaluma nissan. If you are planning to purchase a Nissan make sure you go to Petaluma and ask for Randy Trujillo!< /review>

Like the cars... Don't like the salesforce not working with the service team. Bought car with problems. Had to bring back multiple times for corrections.... My problems could have been avoided if salesforce checked cars before selling them.<//text>
