This gym exceeded expectations. As a downtown local I was looking for a new gym and stumbled upon Fit. The facility had all the equipment I was looking for, friendly staff, super clean and was huge! They even had outdoor decks to workout on and a heated pool and jacuzzi. Not to mention prime view of Petco Park in time for this season. I highly recommend checking this place out, you won't be disappointed!</text>

Great gym in awesome location overlooking Petco park. Many free weights, squat racks, treadmills, and the usual machines. Separate rooms for aerobics, yoga, cycling, boxing. Nice amenities with towels and lockers included. Rooftop lounge pool and spa.< /review>

This gym was very clean with all the equipment you’d expect in a high quality gym. The staff was super friendly and welcoming. I interacted mainly with Kennedy in sales. She had accurate answers to all my questions. Kennedy was also very helpful after I became a member. I contacted her directly with any questions I had while getting adjusted to the gym. She was not pushy at all to make the sale, but checked in with me from time to time to let me know she was there to help. This is exactly what I needed because I recently relocated to the area and was a bit overwhelmed with everything involved with that process. I would highly recommend this gym to anyone in the downtown area.</Text>

I never feel  cramped or claustrophobic when working out like some other open SD gyms (cough* 24 Hour Fitness in Hillcrest *cough). Tons of machines, free weights, cardio equipment, stretching area.

<Text>Stopped going after the pandemic, obviously. Account was on hold. Checked the bank today and saw a charge from these guys for $115.00. Who in the hell authorized you to steal $115.00 from me? It's been a year. Who is to say I even live in San Diego any more? I suggest you stop charging people until they authorize it. I will be calling you guys tomorrow for a refund. Or just deal with my bank. Thieves.

Edit. At least they refunded the $$<//Text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I am very disappointed with Fit Mission Beach Customer Service since the first time I've been there.
I was wearing shorts and flip-flops - ready to go to the beach on a Saturday morning.

When I arrived there, the sales rep started to show me the membership prices and discussing it right away. I asked "you're not going to show me the gym first?" Then he said "I just want to make sure you're aware of our pricing". What does it mean? Did I look like I didn't have financial conditions to pay for the membership?
Then I asked him about a discount of course. I am a business woman. I work with purchasing for years and also have sales and customer service experience. Of course I'll try to negotiate everything. Then he said there was no discount available, and in sum, that they don't need to offer any discount since they have enough customers already.

I was impressed with the location, but very disappointed with this very poor customer service. Even though, I really wanted to work out with that view. So I went to downtown location just to sign up with a different person. I had a very nice experience with Rachel, so I closed the deal.
Today, 3 weeks later, I had a very bad experience with the manager AARON BAZZ.

The gym was closing. I was so focused and exhausted that I didn't realize by the time. So this manager came to me to say the gym was closed that I had to leave. I was like "ok, I didn't realized the time". So I left the training room and went outside to sit for 1 minute. This manager came to me again saying "I told you the gym is closed and you have to leave". I said "I am just breathing. Can I just stay to breath for 1 minute?" He said "No!! You have to leave right now!!"

I didn't even waste my time arguing. He treated me with total disrespect, was not kind, polite at all! He was super rude and I will not tolerate this kind of treatment from no one.
That's an expensive gym compared to the others, and the "cheaper" ones never treated me like that, with such disrespect and very bad customer service.

The gym looks nice, the location is nice, but totally not worth it for this very bad customer service. I live in San Diego for over 5 years and never been treated like that!< /Review>

This is a late entry to my short experience here before covid happened. Great facility and equipments but the customer service is so unpleasant. This includes misleading advertisement when signing up (my fault for relying on the words of the rep and not reading the agreement line by line), delayed response from their membership team, and such a hassle to cancel my membership. If you care about the equipment and the ambience only, then certainly a great gym. If you care at all about whether this place truly values their members.... I recommend somewhere else.</Review>

Super nice location, luxurious style/design, pool, wellness area, the view, overall very clean and especially the training area and the equipment are superb. This gym is for serious athletes, looking to train heavy and not just do cardio enjoying a view, like many other 'high level' gyms.
The staff was very friendly. We got a tour by Kennedy who was very lovable and caring and did a great job introducing us to the gym so that we felt welcome right away.

Loving this FIT as much as the others! Great location for downtown, awesome parking garage with 2 hours free, beautiful venue, clean bathrooms, and another rooftop pool and hot tub right next to Petco Park! I have a taken a couple yoga classes now and the teachers are very knowledgable, great music, challenging and relaxing sequences and interesting philosophical themes.</Text>

<review>A bit disappointed with this gyms staff and the lack of inclusivity and just general awareness. A coworker and I toured the gym and the representative was informed we were coworkers/friends. He directed all his attention to my male coworker. After the tour he only grabbed information for him.
A bit of a disappointment considering that he was trying to sell a membership and I was actually highly motivated before going on the tour.
I’d encourage some active listening and rapport building training considering how expensive the membership is alone.<//review>< Rating>

BEWARE. It’s been 2 days already how I am trying to get in touch with someone to cancel the membership. I was told that the only way to cancel is to send an email. I reviewed an email back suggesting to freeze the membership for an additional $15 monthly fee. I emailed back asking to cancel the membership and freezing the membership does not work for me. And it’s been 2 days without any response. Great place if you want to subscribe until the end of your life 🤣😂.<//review>

I've been in over 600 gyms worldwide. This is the best.  Might be lacking for serious power lifters, but for everyone else it's fantastic.  Great free weights.  Never seen a gym with a fire pit by the pool!  Just wish the young people would put their phones down and lift</review>

Just wanted to start out by saying this place is so much more than a local gym. You're treated like family day in and day out by the men at the front desk. Most of them remember your name when you come in regularly and start your training days off which a huge smile! Love that this gym has old school machines instead of the new hoist commercial gym standards! If you're interested in a serious gym and a fit family that will help you reach your health goals I highly recommend you walk in and give this gym a try! (Very affordable and zero BS contracts and fees) Started bodybuilding here a little over 2 years ago and just going to add that the owner and his sons are absolute gentlemen! Mad respect to this gym for changing names, keeping true to their core beliefs and continuing to run the gym the way WE want :)<//Review>

<Review>In short, every time I tried to freeze my membership, I was charged anyway. When I cancelled my membership, I was charged anyway. Can you get a refund? Of course not.

If you ever plan to cancel, do it in person and get paper documentation.

I wouldnt recommend this gym to anyone, especially active duty service members who leave for long periods of time. Go to a regular gym where the process is easy and the managers care.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

If I could give this gym 6 stars I would. I recently relocated from Dallas, Texas and looked around for a gym to join using yelp and google reviews. I have to say I am completely satisfied with every aspect of this club. I have not had a bad experience, and the gym is always kept in tip top shape. Since joining this gym I have been training with Bill Dayton 3 times a week,  Bill has not only helped me reach personal goals but helped guide me into a healthier path.  I highly recommend this gym, and for personal training purposes to reach out to Bill. The gym and training is worth every dollar.< /text>

Blew my mind! I fell in love with this place after just a moment of entering the establishment. Excellent staff and love the different sequestered workout areas! Not private, but there were various small areas you could work out in peace. Barkley Davies was HANDS DOWN, my favorite part of my first visit to Fit! He was very knowledgeable of the establishments' rules, regulations, and staff. He knew exactly what he was talking about and voluntarily offered his professional fitness advice when I inquired about my fat body. I told him I was sad and needed help getting out of the beanbag I called a body. Love it.</Review>

This is the Coolest gym I have ever been to! I have been a member at Equinox and some of the so called "Super" gyms of 24 hour fitness and this place has something uniquely different. The energy is high, the crowd is awesome, and most of all it is CLEAN! They have outside social events and you feel more like you are belonging to a hip country club rather than just a gym.  Please build more of them. : )<//Text>

I love Fit!  Been a member since they opened 10+ years ago.  The classes are really what keep me here.  A free gym opened at my work, in my building and I just can't leave my Fit classes.  The teachers, Connie, Tina, Dominic, to name a few are awesome.</review>

FIT really has it all! From amazing facilities to tanning beds and saunas to awesome healthy food you can buy and a fun social environment, FIT has it. The environment is what you want from a gym and the group classes are great. They have a really great mixed martial arts room with equipment you don't even see in strictly martial art gyms. At FIT you can meet fun people and enjoy all of the social perks as well. I've paid more at gyms that don't offer anything that FIT has to offer, so I would say that it is well worth it. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!<//Text>

FIT is the best gym in San Diego hands down. They have a great staff, and it's the cleanest gym I've ever been inside. They carry all the state of the art machinery. They throw Vegas style rooftop pool parties during the summer with food and beer for everyone. The members all seem to carry themselves with class (No meatheads). The women are beautiful. What else do you need?? Come on in and join the fun.<//text>

I've been going to Fit for the better part of a year now and it is by far the best gym I have ever belonged to. The moment you walk inside you can tell that this won't be like your typical gym experience. From the towel service they provide, the the spa-like conditions of the locker room, to the view directly into Petco Park...it really doesn't get any better.

The staff have always been friendly and helpful to me. The machines have always been in awesome condition and working properly give or take the inevitable breakdown that is usually fixed quickly. I go at what I would consider the beginning of peak hours for a gym and I rarely have to wait for equipment. Honestly, one of my favorite things about the gym is the clientele. When you are paying a premium for your gym, you better believe you are taking your fitness seriously. I love being surrounded by like-minded individuals that clearly have a passion for fitness, but aren't there to judge the people around them.

The price might be higher than most gyms in the area, but you get what you pay for. I personally could not be happier.</review>

<review>One of the best gyms I have ever been too. At first I was a bit put back with the price, but compared to other gyms in there area, this one has it all. Make sure to mention you are Active Duty for different pricing. Inside the facility you'll find amazing yoga classes (esp Viktoria!), all the equipment you'd ever need, and pool/sauna/steam room/Jacuzzi.

Not to mention, the view from the balcony is amazing.<//review><userid>108438241272940311416< /userid>< pics>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Best gym downtown San Diego!! Great crowd, staff is very friendly and helpful. There was no hard close or anything, the staff let me work out for a few days, try it out and make sure it was the right feel for me which I really appreciated. They were awesome. The cleanest and most well maintained gym I have ever been a member of(or worked out ever) All the equipment is up to date and seems like they are always upgrading. They also add a great social aspect to the fitness lifestyle from pool parties at the FIT pool to hosted bars at different restaurants downtown! And the best part, everything is included with the membership which is a very good price for all they offer at FIT!</text>< Pictures>

I tried out all of the gyms with steam rooms in the area and am so happy with this one. The parking at AquaVie was only valet, 24 hr steam room wasco-ed/no towel service and I can't recall why I didn't love Broadway athletic club, but I do love Fit! The parking is easy and convenient, it's never crowded when I come (11amish) the yoga classes are great, its clean...< /Text>

<Text>This place is a joke. Way too crowded.  Unfriendly staff and members.  Classes (except yoga) are terrible and not challenging.  No idea what their pool is about, certainly not laps or exercise.  A 'high-end' gym shouldn't run out of towels hourly or have a line for the shower.  Anyone who thinks this is a premier athletic club has never actually been to one.< /Text>< Pics>

Fit is unlike any other gym out there. Everything is top notch, from the friendly and helpful staff to the trainers and state of the art equipment. When joining Fit, you don't only become a member but a part of a community. You will never get sick of going to Fit since there is always something going on. Throughout the summer Fit throws pool parties on their rooftop pool that overlooks Petco Park and other events like member appreciation days. I highly recommend going in to check Fit out!< /Review>

FIT is an excellent place to work out.  They have great machines and top notch equipment.  Also, I LIKE to work out to loud music...no headphones is a plus.  I LIKE added perks to my memberships and I LIKE fitness staff who can walk the walk and talk the talk.  Come to one of their Sat events and get to know their staff to find out for yourself.</text>

The equipment is dated, the organization is bad, the flooring throughout is designed for small lifting platforms, not a gym floor because it's not designed for walking, just impact lifting. The floor is the wild west, with a number of people that simply don't know gym etiquette, or fundamental lifting, and did I mention the equipment is 'dated'. There is no speciality of the gym, yoga, functional classes, fusion training room, cardio and stretching, it's all like a bad buffet where there's a lot of it, but nothing good. The lockers couldn't make code if they opened today, and maintenance is non existent.

Customer service? Good luck w finding that too...if u want consistent parking, you'll need to buy that from ACE parking downtown... $100 month, again, if they opened today, their parking would not be sufficient to get a permit to operate...

All this, and a cool 80-100 month to go...if u must try it, do it for 30 days, no matter 'what' cool program they're offering 'that day only'... trust me, if you like this type of training, go to 24 hour fitness downtown at Horton... $25 month, $25 annual to renew, plenty of parking. And even though it's not great, it's better than this FIT facility, at a fraction of the cost, which is what it'd be worth.</Text>

<Review>Highly unprofessional and rude staff; even their club manager does not exhibit any professionalism. Also, terrible hygiene as nobody wipes the equipments after their use, and their yoga room is filthy. There are much better, cleaner and  truly high-end gyms. Do not waste your time and money at this high-end wanna be, pretentious club! Do not be fooled by their 4.1 star rating, as I highly doubt the genuineness of the reviewers and their being actual club members.< /Review>< Response>

<Text>Gym has nice amenities though the weights are outdated, and customer service is horrible! The front desk ladies aren’t friendly or courteous. When I purchased my one-week membership there the guy spelled my name incorrectly in their system, even when I gave him my ID card. Also, he seemed pretentious and unwelcoming. Treating clients well is everything to a business. I wouldn’t recommend this place.< /Text></record>

Beware! This gym is hella scammy. I moved to a different state so I called to cancel my membership and they wanted to charge me for another month of membership. I don’t even live in San Diego anymore. I told them they don’t have permission to charge me for another month and I just checked my bank account and they just did. Was waiting to write this review if they did so great job fit management. Like what is the reason for this? Just beware that if you plan on canceling they will charge you for another month even if you don’t plan on coming in at all. F U FIT MANAGMENT

Forgot to add in that this gym gets so busy it’s ridiculous. So if you like crowded gyms to the point where u have to wait on people to use the equipment then this gym is for you.</text>

< review>
I like the club downtown ! I like the staff! I like the fact all machines are clean and get repaired very fast.
The members are respectful and well mannered .
The parking situation can be difficult as u may be stuck sometimes for 10 or 15 minutes when someone is not able to pay on way out.
Putting ur membership on hold is an ordeal .
Every year I take few months off .
Last year they kept charging me as I notified the administration I was leaving for few months .
I decided to let go and forget a refund.
This year they did the same thing! They charged me 2 months as they were properly notified !
First they could not find my email notifying them I was leaving for few
Minth.
They then decided to refund one month. Then after resenting all documentation then they accepted to refund me 2 months . I am not sure if they are disorganized or what! But I wasted a lot of time to get
Back my money!< /review>

I sincerely hope that Chad the General Manger has time to reflect on the situation. I have belonged to Fit for close to a year. The club is beautiful and the majority of the staff are fantastic. Alas, one bad apple can spoil the bunch. I have complaiend about this young woman more than once to management, about the absolute horrific treatment and customer service of this front desk attendant. She never smiles, is curt, rude and lacks any basic customer service skills.

This past weekend I had my wallet stolen including all my credit cards. Despite my explanation to the young woman at the front desk - and fact that I am in here almost daily - this attendant refused me admittance until I had a new card on file. I had to literally return to my car in the basement and retrieve my temporary wallet and another temp. atm card, and then had to deal with her nasty demeanor as I asked why she was rude and forced me to leave the gym and provide a card I did not want have yet. I am certain she is aware of my complaints about her attitude in the past but felt on this weekend, whithout managment on site, she could exact her revenge.

In addition to Fit, I hold memberships at Chuze fitness and YMCA. While their gyms are not as nice or flashy, they are the most friendly, smiling and courteous staff in the business. While Fit is visibly nice, it is extremely expensive. The attitude and lack of customer service adds up and this was the final straw. As a CEO, I know how crucial friendly customer service is in any business. This continued staffing of people who are rude, wil not earn or retain my business. I hope this message rings true and that changes are made, as the gym itself is a wonderful venue for fitness.

UPDATE: it has been one year since discussing the matter with Chad the GM. He chose to do nothing, stating that this employee had been there for several years and was having a bad day. He stated he would “talk” with her, offered no recourse or way to make up for the event. Funny as it was, I ended up getting flagged for not having my new card on file, despite having him put it In himself. The place was simply not well run in the staffing department, which is critical for gyms. In the end, it was time for me to go. I have missed aspects of the gym, as it was beautiful and the patrons were serious about fitness, but the continued lack of customer service, unfriendly demeanor and treatment of clientele as “lucky” to belong, is something I see far to often with local businesses these days and I just won’t  spend a premium monthly fee to be treated like dollar bill instead of a human being.

have been a member of FIT for almost 2 years and am so pleased with my experience there.   I have never been one for fancy gyms that intimidate you with all of the intense people walking around and taking up classes.  So I was a bit apprehensive when I joined but decided to give it a try.   I had tried everything from 24-hour fitness, to Frogs, to La Jolla Sporting Club, to the YMCA,  and more.  All delivered either a subpar customer service experience (where I felt like just a number), were too "posh" that I felt self conscious, classes were always full or instructors were routinely late.

I have been pleased to find that FIT is the best of all worlds - beautiful, clean, modern gym with all the amenities you could ask for PLUS amazing classes, fantastic/motivating instructions (no matter your fitness level), a small cafe/food area with fresh ideas on nutrition, and the list goes on!

I have finally found my gym for life!  Thank you FIT!</review>

Pros: Great equipment variety
Lot of room to workout
Rarely gets crowded
You get towel service
Tons of ameneties; pool, sauna, steam room, heated yoga, crossfit

Cons: The Hours are horrible, they close at 10pm and weekends open at 7am
When something breaks it will stay broken for at least a month
The AC does not work during summer or maybe they just dont want to turn it on but it feels really stuffy

Do good research before you commit yourself to something it might be worth it for some might not be for others,

PS also be sure to google some of the other people who have commented/rated here notice they are mostly employees/ affiliates so dont go by all the ratings / comments DO YOUR RESEARCH</text>

< Review>
I belong to this gym.  I like that it is downtown and that the facilities accomadate a large flow.  The classes however are all close together for after work hours and the classes are jammed. Though there are several styles of fitness classes, most of them all feel like the same thing different name or instructor.

This gym charges a lot for additional classes and I believe it has over valued itself as a luxury fitness center.  Platnum membership is about 500.00 per month and I just do not feel the gym meets its price.  Regular membership is 100.00 plus per month.

The sales guys all seem to hang out at the top of the railing on the second floor giving an uneasy feeling to newcomers.  It feels a lot like the "IN" club, both with sales and staff.  Not so sure I am as impressed with the gym and it's atmosphere as when I signed up.

Good things:  Great locker rooms always kept clean.  Though the seats are showing rips in the seams already. Lockers are coded, so no need for bringing a lock.  Towels are good and kept stocked for both the shower and the fitness room.

Steam room and Saunas in both mens and womens locker rooms.  I like the privacy of this.

Unbearable things:  MUSIC Ultra LOUD.  Pool not a lap pool.  Jacuzzi is broke most of the time.  No lotions or cotton balls or mouth wash supplied in locker rooms.(look at the price and you will agree that these things should be provided including razors for shaving.)  Equipment is often not kept up with, lots of machines broken for months.

I have belonged to private resort set style gyms in the past and all amenities were included in pricing.

A bit of a big let down.  Was not impressed with my personal training either.  Just has a glossy look and some of the sparkle of extras but not fully making the cut.  Will not renew my membership<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Excellent gym. Very well equipped.

For weights and cardio IT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED.

I would have liked some bars to do pull ups or parallel ones, although there were, somewhat limited.

The cardio area (although I don't do much) is more than equipped, with a direct view of the Petco Stadium.

Also excellent staff, all very friendly.

Clean bathrooms and spacious lockers.

We had a problem setting up our cricket account for a data plan we originally purchased at another location.

Apparently the first store hadn't known what they were doing but the young ladies in this store helped us to quickly figure out the problem and get it fixed.</text>

Although I live in Auburn, which is 30 miles away in the foothills, I always visit this Sacramento branch to service all my Cricket needs. The reason is simple: fast , efficient , courteous service from all associates. In particular, LizBeth always expedites my orders quickly while Malik ( Manager) provides super tech support. His knowledge  +  desire to go beyond 100% for any question is truly astounding. Malik has saved me time, money and headaches with all my cell phone concerns. Highly recommend this Cricket Wireless location!<//Review>

<text>My boyfriend and I went into cricket to buy a phone case right here on El Camino there was a woman sitting at the counter helping someone else,   We patiently waited for 25 minutes the lady working was named CHEY  she did not say one word to us not can I help you one second please what can I do for you nothing as we were waiting she also answered a phone call and help the people on the phone as she was on the phone to more customers walked in behind us at that point after waiting 25 minutes we walked out as we were leaving we look back and see her helping the people that came in after us the customer service there is terrible!!!!!! Are we were trying to do is buy a phone case I am a customer there for at least a year now and bought my iPhone there so as you know I’ve spent a lot of money with cricket they treat their customers bad and they don’t have a problem doing it< /text>< Date>

< review>
I walked in and waited 15 minutes for the dealer here to tell me I couldn't buy a phone on display because it was too overpriced (on sale for 1/3 of the retail price, and under $100). He then tried to tell me  what phone he thought I needed and upsell me at three times the price of the phone I came in to buy. I may be a woman, but I am a professional software developer, I know what I want, and I walked out and bought my phone elsewhere. I must say, it's exactly the phone I wanted, and performs exactly as I thought it would.</review>

HORRIBLE service with a VERY BAD attitude. We ordered take out food dinner on Mother’s Day. Took over 45 minutes to get food after they called and said it’s almost ready. The lady at the front (name Lugveg or ludbeg) had a very bad attitude as if we were annoying her to be there. One of the owners or family members threw our food on the counter because we asked if our food was ready. The only nice one was the young kid working the register. Everyone else had a very bad attitude. Do not go here, they have the worst attitudes and their food is mediocre at best.</Review>

<text>When it comes to service, It’s not the best restaurant experience.
Waited 10 minutes before anyone came to take out order. No one asked or served water at any point.
Even the beer ordered never came through for the first 20 minutes.
Then the plate served still had soap on them.

Even the Volunteers at a Gurudwara have an excellent service than these paid professionals.

I noticed other seated tables as well waiting in desperation for their orders.

Our main entree came before our appetizer and no one comes to follow up. You literally have to stand from your seat and shout to ask something.

I hope the owner better serve the next customer and learn from their past blunders.<//text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>First off let me say that if you’re going to want to open your restaurant in United States of America then you need to learn the laws of the land and that includes that service dogs are allowed into every store and restaurant in the public arena. When I walked in the owner lady kept trying to tell me I needed to sit outside and I kept telling her service dogs are allowed inside and I finally said look the federal government allows service dogs to accompany their owner because of a medical reason if you don’t understand that then you should not be owning a business here.  So she finally let me inside with my service dog. I was told that these people have had a business for 10 years and that’s more than enough time that they should know things like this.

Also usually with Indian food there are at least a couple dishes that are mild and not spicy. Such as the samosas or the lentil soup‘s or the tiki masala‘s. My husband ordered a couple of these items because other other Indian restaurants they are mild enough that there is no heat and only flavor to the seasoning. The lentil soup is not mildly spice as it says in a samosas had quite a bit of what I’m guessing is cardamom and made it way too spicy for him to be able to eat it so we basically wasted some of our money.

The owner also took forever to get our food out as well as over 10 minutes to bring us our ticket when we asked to pay when there was only one other group in the restaurant. The waitress was very nice but I do not believe I will be coming here again I will be going to tandoori nights from now on like I used to< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x8094681dd7877987:0x69433d29f1a2329c< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I forgot to take pics of my dish, but let me say that I had the pleasure to visit the Curry House establishment and the traditional Lamb w/Rice, Naan and Chicken Curry dishes.  Greeted by a pleasant wait staff, respectful and conversational.

They have beer for sale and trying to tempt me with  beer w/ lunch during the workweek.  Deciding to go for a soda drink on tap, watch out in asking for Iced Tea, be sure you specify non-sweetened but found out their Iced Tea is sweetened.

I give the Curry House and recommend the amazing flavor and presentation on the dish's served and that they deserve a sold 5 stars for honoring Military and Veterans with a discount.< /text>

OVERPRICED. I ordered 2 of the chef specials chicken tikka masala and 2 garlic naan, each $15 and the naan $3 each for a total of $40 After picking up my order i realized they had only given me 1 bowl of masala and one wrap of garlic naan. I called to ask for a refund at which the told me they combined the two orders and gave me a 32oz of masala and 4 naan breads in one wrap. I did not ask them to do this &...for $30 INSANE. I’m paying a dollar per ounce ? Or they lied. Either way I’m not coming here again. And bad customer service! When I went in there was a table with nearly 15 people NONE OF THEM HAD MASKS ON, not even the employees.<//Review>

We had a party there and they gave us very bad service, never going again and I don’t recommend anyone going either. Old food and soda was served to us. No one was serving anything, nothing was clean. The owner was very rude.</text>

They had me thinking I was invisible, one employee nearly walked through me if I didn't step aside. Zero manners, zero customer services skills. To top it off, thier food was hot garbage. I ended up throwing 75% away. Might as well have mixed oil with melted butter and chili at home. Don't waste your time or money.</Review>

I am still wondering how we ended up at this place. The quatities of all the food were so huge we ended up with more than 50% leftovers. The biryani’s were definitely not one would expect. They mix curry of the respective meat in rice and call it a biryani(saw chunks of white rice unmixed). The starters were not fresh for a sunday lunch. I could smell the meat while having chicken tandoori. Definitely needs upgrade to service and the food!!< /Review>

We eat Indian cuisine every weekend... so I’m familiar with fine Indian Cuisine... I loved that the food was delicious and they are currently offering out door dining. The Tika masala was great 👍🏽 also the lassi smoothie! I was blown away with the chick peas. Ive never liked chick peas untill now because they make theirs so good!< /text>

I went to this place on a recommendation from a coworker and boy I was not disappointed! The staff was so friendly and the food was delicious. The chicken Tikka Masala was out of this world and I highly recommend it. The food is pricey but in the end it is well worth the price.</review>

Worst experience ever. Ordered chicken curry and rice, waited about 45 minutes when I was the only customer in the restaurant. They forgot the rice and the chicken was mostly fat and gristle and grey meat. The lady who took my order was rude and I just ended up throwing the $20 meal in the trash because it was not edible.</text>

Horrible service unless you're the right kind of people.   The last two times I've been there i watched a table of people get the royal treatment while i waited way too long for service.  I'll never go back.   It used to be much better.   Now it seems like they would prefer an empty restaurant save one table of important people.<//review>

<text>Okay the food was really good. They have a good amount of vegetarian options. Everything else was kind of weird. We went in for the $12 lunch buffet, got a side of garlic naan bread, and two glasses of water yet our tab came to $35??? The man ringing us up spoke broken English and was not our waiter and just seemed really confused as to what we ordered. No receipt was given so I am still really confused about that extra $11? Also the music selection was interesting, to each their own, but that was the first time eating I have heard"N****r make that p***y drip" amongst other lyrical prose, really interesting music over all.</text><rate>2<//rate><Date>1564452319937</Date>< pics>

On the weekend what more would you ask other than all you can eat Indian food. And I loved the variety available for the lunch buffet and it tastes really good. the ambiance was also to the mark. I would really go there again and again.</Text>

My favorite Indian restaurant in town. I'd recommend coming here for their lunch buffet, which is currently at 11:00 A.M - 2:00 P.M.

They have a good amount of different items available. It's a fairly small venue, so you might miss it if you don't keep an eye out for it.< /review>

This restaurant used to have better food under previous management.
The staff is good, but cook needs to make drastic changes in cooking.
The cook needs to know that customers know fresh food from stale.  The good reviews are likely submitted by family or friends of the owners.</review></record>

< Review>
I usually have the delicious curry or some form of curry. Really good flavor. Mop up the gravy with a bread tortilla thing, forgot the name but they have a garlic form and a normal non-garlic form which I like better. Cold beer, sodas or ice tea or ice water. If I go earlier I can get the all-you-can-eat smorgasbord. And that’s really tastey . Don’t know the names but the waitresses are willing to assist you. Went about 5 times and enjoyed each time very much.</Review>

<Text>Who is cooking this food? They have all varieties but nothing taste good, strong flavour, too heavy (adding cream) and salty. The flavours are overpowering and too strong.. Pakodas are not cooked from inside. Staff are attending and helpful but wish they could improve their food quality .In veggie items most of the time it's mix veg .They need to cook more differential vegetables like eggplant, okra etc . (Nice looking hotel though)< /Text><time>1520802856631< /time><Resp>None</Resp>< name>

I came here with my family on a Saturday evening, there were 9 of us and we all had a great time. The food was delicious, we all liked the food that we had. Some of us got the chicken pakoras, the tandoori chicken, and the curry chicken and it was great, some of the best I've ever had. Everyone else in my family is vegetarian and so they got vegetarian dishes and they said they were good too. Then we got dessert which was also good. The service is great too. They quickly seated us and they brought our food to us fairly quickly. We will definitely come here again, this is the best Indian restaurant in Fresno for sure.<//Review>

<review>LUNCH BUFFET 11 AM - 3PM
While visiting Fresno,  I happened to see this on google maps.  I'm so very happy I tried this place.  The buffet has many options.  The flavor is GREAT.  I'd highly recommend this place to anyone.  I even tried some dishes I'd never had before. The new dishes did not disappoint. They have tastey vegetarian options, as well as great meat options.  The garlic naan was so yummy,  buttery, delicious.  Beyond the food,  the place looks beautiful and well kept.  This could be a good spot for a dinner date as well.  The staff are very attentive and super friendly.< /review><gmapID>0x8094681dd7877987:0x69433d29f1a2329c</gmapID>< name>

My wife and I really love this place!  We were looking for a good place to eat about 6 months ago and found it then.  As soon as we left we were trying to figure out when the next time we would be able to come back.  Oh, when Courtney (our daughter) is here she will really like it!  Well that was today, we took her there for her birthday lunch and we all loved it again!  The buffet is really good, I think that I am in India again eating locally.  Awesome atmosphere and great food!  I can't wait to go back again.<//review>

<Review>It used to be good here. Today was no so much 😒. All of the protein on the buffet was pretty old. Everything I had from fish to chicken and sausage had been out for hours. I could have looked past this because there were plenty of vegetable choices.

What made it unacceptable today was that we always order nann with no butter because my wife has issues with it. When it came out it clearly, and I mean clearly had butter all over it. When I asked if we could get a second one that actually had no butter I was told to "dig through the basket because some of them didn't have that much butter and it would be fine". I don't need someone telling me what will be fine for me when I clearly ordered a product a certain way.

I'm not very particular for myself but if you can't leave butter off of bread that you are supposedly making fresh with every order then I will just go to Royal Taj or India's Oven. Those are two alternatives where you can be confident you will get what you order, and with a smile 😀. This will most likely be the last time I visit Curry House, and that sucks because we have eaten here more times than I can count.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

I've had good meals and enjoyed the entire experience in the past. Recently I had a fish curry which had dry or freezer burned fish. I complained to the waitress and after she spoke to the cook, she said there was nothing they could do about it. I paid the bill , but I won't return as there must be better curry and service in Fresno</review>

<text>The food here is good and the staff is really friendly.  We ordered the tandoori chicken and the chicken biriyani, plus naan, and it was a lot of food for 2 people. We had leftovers for the next day. The food tasted authentic and it was delicious. I asked for medium spice and it was quite spicy for medium but we liked it. My husband and I both agree that we will go back.</text><userid>101749664498625630176</userid>< Response>

Last night, we ordered the butter chicken and lamb vindaloo. Got home and my husband discovered he got chicken vindaloo instead. This was unfortunate because it triggered his poultry allergy. It was too late to call them to fix the order. Today I called and the guy was super rude. He insisted that I bring back the already tasted chicken vindaloo. I incredulously told him my husband already ate out of the container hence his allergic reaction. I suspect they may have wanted it back to see if I was being forthcoming or to possibly re-sell our portion. Either way, that is completely idiotic since it was their error and I will never eat there ever again.< /Review>

Great food.  The staff is very helpful.  The lunch special buffet is well worth it.  Try the Lamb Vindaloo< /Text>

The Curry House had great flavors and large portion dishes. The food is good and the service is friendly. It is a tad expensive, but pretty normal for Indian  food.</text>

Good quick Indian Food.  The lunch buffet was at a good price and value.  Great for those who haven't eaten Indian food before... as it gives you a chance to try several items.</Review>

I have been coming in for about 3 years or so. Probably my favorite Indian restaurant in the valley since North India has been gone. I really enjoy the Chicken Briyanaye and Shrimp Maslala. I would defiantly recommend Curry House! :)<//Review>

We've been giving this place so many chances. It is over beyond salty. Chicken tikka masala and chicken pakora asi so salty where I had to drink water every bite.  The only one dish that I think its decent was chicken tikka. I hope the owner read this review and hope they stop being so heavy on salt.<//text>

<Text>Curry house, Indian Bistro and Bar is one of the best Indian restaurant we have ever tried in the USA. Every time we are in Fresno area, we go to Curry House because it’s the best.
My kids love going here for their variety of favorite dishes.  We love everything they have on the menu. Food is delicious, clean and very friendly staff.
We always enjoy their yummy  appetizers such as samosas, fish pakoras, tandoori chicken , chole bhature, etc.
We like the main courses such as butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, mutton curry, vegetarian curry with garlic naan.
Can’t wait to go back here again.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Our admiration and regular visits to Curry House is no secret....we love their elaborate and delicious lunch buffet and also the food ordered ala carte.... we have been there on different days and have noticed changed dishes for the buffet....they have great chefs, courteous staff and clean restaurant.... their prices are very reasonable and portions very sufficient.....they also gave us complimentary chai when we ordered the best in town cholley-bhature.... we did catering from them and all our guests kept praising for the food and the presentation....they gave complimentary lunch buffet prizes for my 10 guests as the lotto winners at our party..... we are so thankful for their services and consider them the best Indian restaurant of Fresno .....the new management and owners have done great job in taking Curry House to the newer heights..... congrats Harman and Preity .....💐</text>

Worst food ever!!!! Used to be good, but today's food didn't taste any good at all. Naan were burnt, shahi paneer tasted like it was full of ilaichi and the color was not fresh. It looked like they heated it up several times before. My friends didn't like the buffet either. When we told the employee, all we got was a sorry!  Never going back and don't recommend at all. I usually don't write reviews, but it was disappointing today.< /Text>

I visited Curry House Indian Restaurant  last night with my family. we started with there famous fish appetizer & Paneer tikka it reminds me Amritsari fish then For main course we ordered Yellow Dal Tarka, Karahi Panner & Malai kofta with there Best Chilly & Garlic Naan's. The presentation of food impress my family and the Taste was just like i ate in india.The best thing about this place is its ambiance and The owner Mr.Harman. he personally came to our table and check reviews about there food. I would like to suggest everyone just go there for good Indian food. 5/5 from my side.< /Text>

<review>Don't dare to go any where else other than this place in Fresno. Outstanding test and service. Small in size but one of the best test I had in USA.

Keep it up guys.

05.02.15

Today I tried Lunch buffet but it's not as great as the menu. So try to go with the menu.

07.17.15

Tried there Paneer Bhurji. It's out the world believe me. Also try there curry house special bread. Now malai kofta and Panner Bhurji are my two fav here.

03.22.2017

Yet another fantastic experience. Keep it up.

11.29.2018

I think there chef is changed. There premium dish Malai Kofta was uncooked and not with the same sauce like before. I am not filling good to see this gem place of flavor fade away.

Bring your chef back.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

My wife and I visited this restaurant on Saturday, 06.06.2015 at 4 PM. The service was terrible and I left all but 2 bites of the chicken curry on the table. The 5 stars and 2 good reviews are shams and likely submitted by family or friends of the owners.<//Text>

this place is racist on Asians.  if u r white white or mexican then u will be fine.  their buffet is not so great anyways.

Very unpleasant welcome.    Tandoori chicken was cold.   Upon notifying,  the server goes "well the heat is on high".  Ordered food to go not realizing the quality, was double priced for the quality of none.

I wish I can give 0 star to this restaurant. Horrible customer service and worst food ever. We were there this evening and I can’t believe they have fly 🪰 in their food. I was really mad but we decided to leave without saying anything. I will try to upload their food picture.< /review>

The 2 young gentlemen at this FedEx location were amazing. They were both SO helpful, patient and kind. Best FedEx service I've ever received, hands down. So much better than the other FedEx options in Downtown Los Angeles. I'm going to make sure to ship all of our important packages through this location in the future.<//Text>

Just terrible, the worker told me that he could fill out the international form so it would go
Smoothly.  He didn’t ask me required info like my friends email and phone, misspelled things and left things off the address of recipient.  Didn’t ask me the value and wrote so unclearly that customs has held the package as they can’t read it and it’s wrongly filled out!  I would
Have gladly filled it out!  I’ve been on the 800 line multiple times and on the phone to my friend trying to save this situation from the moment fed ex took it.  Horrible just horrible.  I still don’t know when it will arrive if it arrives!  120$ for headaches and sloppiness!</text>

<Text>Juan was so amiable and helpful. Super courteous and generous. An overall pleasant demeanor. You know that feeling you get when someone hates their job or doesn’t want to be there? Well, Juan is NOT that. We even chatted about our holidays and it felt like I’ve known him my whole life. This is how I want every customer experience to happen, when we treat each other with respect and courtesy. Keep up the great work Juan!!< /Text><rate>5< /rate><userid>113306987431410749827< /userid>< Time>

<Review>So I guess the guy just can't do his job? I was just in there, printed up a resume and cover letter, then asked if he could copy it on some nice resume paper. He told me AN HOUR WAIT! I've been to FedEx, Kinko's all these places so many times. It takes 30 seconds to print my resume and cover letter on nice resume paper. He said he has "other things to do".  I mean I guess I understand if the guy can't do his job, then my God why is he working for you? Or why can't you hire another employee to work with him since he's not capable of handling a workload by himself?  UPDATE: I went in there a few weeks later and same behavior, same guy.  He says he's closing early, dude just DOES NOT want to do his job no matter what but they don't hire nobody else to help?<//Review></record>

They also sell candy at this location, good for people that are impatient and have to wait longer than they want for their resume to print, so they can have a snack.< /review><UserId.>106990791945063731744<//UserId.><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

<Review>As a Graphic Designer, I'm very picky about quality. FedEx Office Print & Ship Center not only has excellent quality, but the shipping is super fast, the customer service is excellent (they go above and beyond), and they are the most reasonably priced company I have found yet. Could not be happier with them, and I will absolutely continue to do business with them.<//Review>< Pictures>

From E-mail I sent a shipper, after receiving a damaged package:

The Shock Watch Indicator WAS triggered red, and the box was torn and crushed in [on the same side as the Shock Watch indicator]. A photo is attached ...

They told me it was impossible to print a delivery receipt for me to make any notation, and that they refused to sign any written statement whatsoever about the condition of the box when I signed for it.

I had to sign an electronic pad, of the same sort used for credit card signatures. There was low resolution and very little space but I squeezed in "Shock Watch Triggered RED" above my signature.

I talked to three employees at the FedEx center, culminating in the "Center Manager" [Wayne Purkey], simply trying to do what your instructions specified. Each was more unpleasant than the last.<//Text>

I live off 6th and Spring and due to the lack of customer service and inefficiency of the one on 8th i am almost always forced to turn here and they have never once disappointed! I see a lot of 1 star reviews which is shocking to me. This is the best one in downtown LA and while its smaller the staff is courteous, their turn over is fast and efficient and they're honest! My to go to location!<//Text>

During the week and a non holiday the staff is amazing. Been here plenty of times to get my work printed, I would even say I relied on this FedEx for printing.

Unfortunately today, I zipped in to get my work printed. Less then three items and had the most dismissive experience with the staff on hand. Majority of the time I email my items to the store and they print them. It’s less than 15 mins. This guy, young guy with I think braces.. treated me like total waste of time. Told me to go outside the store bc my phone would work better and therefore.. do the job I need done. Did that pointing over there thing where you can get your items printed.

He was so rude and I was put off by his attitude as he was watching I think Netflix? I just walked out and on my way to another location.< /Text>

Impolite and not service-oriented. But, the guy who was working seemed like he was there alone and stressed out. Still, the job I brought in would have taken him a minute and without knowing what I was asking, he preemptively told me that he wouldn't be able to help me until tomorrow :/< /Text>

Rubish customer service as per said and yeah no parking. I unfortunately frequent fedex quite a bit and except for rare occasion their employees are always unhappy. They need to give everyone a raise, a week off, some decent training and generally treat their employees how they want them to treat their customers, with respect.< /review>

<Text>Pretty sure the bad reviews are either from people who never actually went here and are rating FedEx itself, or who went in before Grayson worked here.  I'm writing this review specifically because Grayson went above and beyond to find out where my package was, and despite it being 30 mins before his Friday ended, he was nice and helpful.  Glad to see everyone else has positive things to say about the man as well.</Text><Rate>5< /Rate><resp>None<//resp><user_id>106834827942898654904<//user_id><Name>Truce Cannon<//Name>< date>

<review>Are you kidding me ? It is going from L.A. to near San Diego, which is maybe 120 miles and 3 days for only sending it arround L.A. ??? I feel like driving up there and picking it up. My other encounter with Fedex was, package sent back to sender, because the adress did not exist, but UPS did find it the day before...

<Review>Sign stating "we'll be back in 45 mins" is frequently posted during normal business hours.  Absolutely ridiculous for an express delivery company and highly inconvenient when you've already found parking in this area, where others have noted parking is extremely difficult!<//Review><Rate>1<//Rate>< pics>

People constantly come in and out of here without face masks although the sign says "No Entry Without Mask", indicating this policy is not effectively regulated or implemented by the employees or owner(s) there. Unfortunately, this place is notorious for not cashing out scratchers and lotto tickets depending on who's cashier and what time you go. I take this gamble each time I go there. Nothing much else to say. This place isn't good sometimes, and it isn't bad sometimes. I mean, it's a store, so if your looking to buy something (and not looking to cash out lotto tickets or scratchers), then this place is open.<//Text><Rating>2<//Rating><Date>1615338372434</Date>< userid>

Heavens help me, in the last three months I've had to have four vehicles smog-checked, including a 32' RV.  Brought them all here to Aztec Smog, cause I wanted a local shop and not a part of a big chain.  The tech (Joe?  a courteous, good-looking fella with a nicely trimmed full beard) was knowledgeable, polite and quick.  Better to make an appointment, but I brought two cars in without an appointment and there was no waiting.  He went the extra mile on the RV, too, as it was too big to get into the bay.  Really appreciate the service here and quick response time.  No charge for re-check on a failure.  Highly recommend!<//Text>

<Text>I dropped in to get my car smogged.  I only had to wait for one customer ahead of me.  Joe Dumas the owner tested my car ultimately transmitting the results to the DMV.  He was more than friendly and professional and answered my questions thoroughly.   I will definitely return when my smog requirements come up again..

This is one of the most professional smog check places I’ve ever been to. I got in and out in 10 minutes. The tech on duty (Joe) was professional, courteous, and seemed very knowledgeable about all aspects of his job. I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the San Diego area.< /review>

Maria Lewis went way out of her way to be helpful, which was greatly appreciated. She also sent David of the maintenance crew over the same day to fix a longstanding problem with the fridge, which turned out to be a simple fix. I thank them both again for making this a pleasant place to stay. Also, it's sure nice to see people again after a long lockdown : )< /text>

My family and I have lived at the Villas for 6 years. It is such a wonderful community to live in!
Maria has been the most accommodating and dedicated staff we’ve ever had. It truly saddened me when I learned that she was transferred to another property. But now that she’s back, our work orders, and concerns are sure to be resolved. Thank you so much, Maria!<//text>

We have been living here for about 6 months now. This complex is lovely and beautiful. It's gated and makes it very secure for children, as we have a 3 year old. We had an issue with our fridge and Anthony was our maintenance technician. He was really nice and walked us through how to make sure our fridge doesn't ice up. Thank you Anthony for you work and we appreciate all the staff here for being very friendly! It's a great place to live.</Text>

We lived at the villas at Towngate for a little over a year and it was a nice experience. The newly renovated apartments are extremely nice and the maintenance staff is super legit, especially Frank, he helped us whenever we needed it and went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and taken care of! Thanks Frank! The front office was also very helpful and nice, all of them were super helpful but Crystal in particular made sure we did not want or need for anything while we were there. Thanks to the front office, especially Crystal! We appreciated you guys!<//review>

The Villas at Towngate is a really nice place to live; it's clean, quiet, safe, and well maintained. We just recently moved in and had a great experience with the process. Maria in the office was super helpful and friendly through the whole process and helped us through all the ins and outs of the application process. Right now with the difficulty of finding an available apartment on short notice in Moreno Valley made Maria's help was invaluable. The units are nice and a good value for the price.

I recently moved to The Villas at Towngate in Moreno Valley because I was not happy with the community I had been living in. Management was rude anytime an issue with my unit would come up.

The Villas at Towngate have an amazing staff that are always ready to help whenever an issue may arise. Lynn is the property manager and she has always ensured that any work order I have requested is promptly addressed and fixed. This would not be possible without the help of great team members like Frank and Anthony from maintenance. They are highly skilled and are well prepared to fix, replace, and install anything.

Thank you to the staff for providing a exceptional service.< /text>

He really goes above and beyond and makes you feel that professional hospitality from the apartment complex. He has got all the things that make customer service stand out: smile, friendly, understanding, quick and professional and knows what he is doing since he is an experienced general contractor. I hope you guys dont listen to the bad reviews about maintenance or this apartment complex, this is a great place.

I originally had my heart set on another property and just happened to stop by the Villas at Towngate. This decision changed my life! I immediately fell in love w/ the hardwood floors, Quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances, and spacious layout of this community. I was equally impressed with Maria’s warm personality, and willingness to answer all my questions, and ability to accommodate my specific needs.

Very happy and pleased with the maintenance team! My requests for services are always responded to promptly. I did a walk though with Anthony to explain the issues I was having in the unit, and he was very patient and determined to make it right. I was very impressed! Anthony reassured me that everything was going to get taken care of. He did an outstanding job! Thank you Anthony!<//Text>

I originally had my heart set on another property and just happened to stop by the Villas at Towngate. This decision changed my life! I immediately fell in love w/ the hardwood floors, Quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances, and spacious layout of this community. I was equally impressed with Maria’s warm personality, and willingness to answer all my questions, and ability to accommodate my specific needs. I am super excited to be moving to this community and highly recommend you consider this property if you are looking to move in the near future! Ask for Maria, she will take awesome care of you!< /Text>

<review>Crystal and Maria have helped me with information I needed as well as other resources when I’m unaware of something or need answers to questions during this time and the Covid awareness and rules as far as the office availability and other things. Maria continues to go above and beyond when she can do the bare minimum. I love these apartments and the people that work here, they actually trade the time to get you what you need instead of blowing you off.<//review><user_id>113362781705705309647<//user_id>< GmapID>

My family and I moved in about a month ago and we absolutely love it!!! The apartment is absolutely beautiful completely renovated, the location of my apartment is in a great spot! It’s very quiet, all the girls in the front office were all very kind, helpful and welcoming!! My water heater went out last week and maintenance was quick at fixing it! Over all my experience here has been great and the staff is very friendly!! My only complaint would be the parking, I see lots on cars with expired tags utilizing parking spots, that is a big issue here cars that are using up guest parking with broken down, non registered cars.
Some you can tell have not moved in a while because they are covered in cobwebs, which is an inconvenience for some families that have two cars because then we are forced to park on the street.</review>

I am going on my 1yr mark at the  Villas, and for the most part it has been a good experience. I've had minor issues, and due to COVID-19, I wasn't able to enjoy the amenities.  However, I can say that the staff here is good. I am huge on customer service, and 9/10 times the staff has been really good. The office/property manager Lynn has always been great, and her staff has always been wonderful anytime i needed to speak with them. Thank you to the maintenance team for everything they do. I do recommend this property.< /Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Hello I’ve enjoyed the special relationship I’ve had with Maria at the front office since I moved here in 2019.  Maria has always treated me with special care and attention and she has a sincere down to earth personality that helps ease any stress you may have and works hard to make sure your needs get met as fast as possible. If she can’t meet them she advocates to get things done as fast as possible :)). Crystal has been very sweet and responsive with requests as well as Kiml with pool reservations . The manager has also been kind.  We feel like part of a community now which is especially helpful during this pandemic .  Management has been kind and flexible during the pandemic with regards to rent or any other concerns. Thank you !! Cassandra</Text>< name>

<Review>I cannot say enough great things about the maintenance staff here! Since moving in October of last year (from out of state), they have been pleasant and courteous with every request. I have two dogs (one is a new and very vocal rescue), so I have begun noting that I need to be home for my work orders.

During this time of COVID, they called to schedule an appointment to fix a sticking gas burner. On the day of the appointment, they knocked, but I asked that they reschedule as I needed to take one of the dogs to an emergency vet appointment. Both guys were very understanding and told me that they could be back later on in the day, to which I agreed. Unfortunately, the vet appointment took longer than anticipated, so I missed the time a second time!

I resubmitted the work order a week later with a note for a Tuesday or Wednesday date. On Monday afternoon, the maintenance techs gave me a call to set a time on Tuesday afternoon. They arrived promptly, and quickly fixed the issue, and then had me test it to make sure that everything was working well. While they were in the apartment, I asked about a few minor things (replacing blinds and the air filter), and they offered to get the replacements for me right then and there.

Anthony (who is the newest maintenance technician) made me feel at ease with his amazing customer service. Instead of silently doing the task in the kitchen while I was in the living room, he introduced himself and was very friendly while being trained by Frank.

Frank was quick and efficient, and did everything with a smile. He explained everything to me that he was doing as he did it, and was the one to offer to check the vents after I asked. He has great insight and was so polite with my thousands of questions.

If you have any concerns about any small issues in the apartments here (it happens everywhere), then you should feel comfortable knowing these guys have got you covered!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

< Review>
Very nice community, I spoke with Cristal looking for a two bedroom to move my family into. She was very helpful. They are currently only doing self guided tutoring however, she provided us with a map and guided us towards the show apartment. Once we were done with our tutor we headed back to the office and meet up with Cristal she explained to me the pricing and found what was the best fit for my family.
Over all experience I would have to say was great,
very sweet girl< /Review>

I would not recommend leasing here or even going through the trouble of trying to contact them. I spoke with a leasing agent, Destiny, who gave me a quote of $1,475 per month and said there would be a unit available for my desired move in date. I went online and applied for $45 to the property and after being accepted a different agent called me back and told me the rent would actually be $1,875 and that I would not be able to move in until several weeks after my requested move in date. I explained this is not the quote I was given and then made to feel like I was making the whole thing up. For two straight days I attempted to contact the original agent I spoke to that gave me the false information and was sent to voicemail every time or transferred to their central leasing agency who didnt want to help me. Then the very next day they lowered their rates again on the website, but said I would be stuck with the $1875 since that was the rate on my application. Awful service, dont recommend.<//Text>

I will be moving in December 9th and I am very excited. Kimberly Blancas has been amazing with the whole process from start to finish (signing my lease), it’s easy and comforting communicating with her and she works around my very tight schedule to make sure everything is running smoothly for my move-in. Keep up the amazing work Kim, I can’t wait to move in and enjoy my new unit.< /text>

< Review>
I had a plumbing emergency with my kitchen sink. In the morning about 9:15am I submitted a work order request to have maintenance come to fix the problem. And to be perfectly honest, I thought I would not get a response for several hours or a day or two.  But about 45 minutes or less, Anthony showed up with all that he needed to fix the problem. While he was here, Anthony also fixed my ice maker in the refrigerator while he was here. He was great and very professional.  I am pleased as to how quickly he came because I found that there are only a couple maintenance personnel to take care of over 300 apartments.  Great job.< /Review>

The Management here implemented a rent moratorium to give rent relief to tenants who are impacted by loss of income due to Covid-19. I personally needed this assistance for the the month of April and the staff was extremely understanding and very prompt and courteous in setting me up with an affordable repayment plan. I have never been through anything like this before, as I'm sure many others haven't been as well, and I assured through the whole process that I was in good hands and there was nothing to worry about. Hats off to the entire staff for their support!!< /text>

When we brought this up with the manager they told us all they can do if file a report for their records. My mom got all her work equipment stolen! I have an insurance claim and police report filed so this isn't a lie. I was not the only one that has experienced a break in other residents I've talked too have also. It's not a secure place the gates are left open all the time and if you don't believe me take a look around the apartment and you'll see that anyone can just drive and walk in there. The gate on Dracea has never worked and they claim to fix it! To top that off parking is horrible! For over 1500 in rent this should be a better community to live in! Stop any resident and ask them they will tell you and these reviews that are on here are not true. Look at Yelp and you will see. These people do not care about the residents here<//text>< Name>

<Text>Living at Villas at Towngate is wonderful, it is quiet,clean,and friendly. What made my move in and my and my second lease easy was the leasing agent Cristal Medel she made everything fast easy and fun. She is always a phone call away when issues arise with my apartment with the upmost courtesy and promptness. I left a 5 star review because I feel Cristal deserves 4 all by herself 👏👏< /Text>< time>

< Review>
The villas at towngate staff and management is very unprofessional, I was dealing with a major plumbing issue in which was sewer coming through my bathtub feeling the whole tub up with black sewer and water  which kept occurring after being told
It wouldn’t come back  it had a strong smell that gave me and my kids head ache and also I told it is a disadvantage of living on the first floor. Manager never contacted me to see how everything was going and they sent out 4 different plumbers to try to resolve the issue and it didn’t work until the 5th time which was the week of thanksgiving. From November 5th to November 21 I dealt with the issue. The only reason I gave 1 star is because they wouldn’t let me not select any stars. If it was up to me it would be a 0.< /Review>

Maria Lewis is exemplary of a professional leasing agent. She’s compassionate, knowledgeable, and personable who goes above and beyond!
She’s truly a blessing and I’m thankful fate led me to her. Without her patience and thinking outside of the box, I’d still be searching for a place to call home.

It’s been many years now that I’ve been living at the Villas at Towngate.  What has kept me here all this time is the excellent management.  Once in a while, I will have something break down or not work. But in every instance, the management, especially the current management with the likes of Lynn, Crystal, Maria, Frank, Anthony, David, Delsey, Anthony, and not least of all Kimberly have all co-ordinated to resolve any problem that I’ve ever had.  I know them by name because of the relationships I have fostered with them.  Why bother? They treat us like its more than a job.</Review>

<Review>Had another wonderful experience here with the team here at Villas at towngate! Shout out to Delsy. Delsy showed me a prime example of what it’s like to go above and beyond for someone. I was going through and intensely stressed situation and she was there with me every step of the way making sure everything went as smoothly as possible. She made herself available and ready during times when I needed her assistance. She was extremely patient and sympathetic during these trying times and although I don’t want to say much about the situation just know that because of her we were successful! Me and my family will be forever grateful for the greatness and compassion she has shown throughout this process. THANK YOU DELSY!!!!!

-with love from Dahlia & kids☺️< /Review>< Resp>

Ms. Maria and all the young Ladies are very sweet, nice and very helpful inside the office.

I can't leave out the maintenance guys they're great as well....last but not least Mr. Ernie and Juan the janitor and yard man are all very helpful and thorough.

If I had a business I would steal them from the Villas.....😀<//text>

I really enjoyed the tour of the apartments. Popcorn and drinks were provided at the front office. The office was a nice welcoming environment. My sales associate Kimberly was very welcoming and knew each apartment we saw. She took the time to show me each layout and answer any questions I had about moving in and the lease.< /text>

Great place to live and wonderful staff. They’re always willing to help and answer questions. I gave 4 stars because we unfortunately, had our bike stolen from our 3rd floor balcony.

ZERO STARS. STAY AWAY. Absolute sleazebags. I signed a lease with them about two weeks ago for a one bedroom at approx. $1360 and was excited to move in at the end of the month. Got a call from them this weekend two weeks before we were supposed to move in saying the apartment has extensive water damage and won't be ready until the end of October. I said that's fine, we will wait, no problem. They said no they can't offer the place to us anymore because they're now going to remodel it and rent it out at a substantially higher rate. They then said they could offer us nothing at the signed upon rate and could only offer apartments that were $200-$500 more expensive per month than the rate that I had signed the lease for and the only thing they could do if we would not agree to sign a more expensive lease was to refund our deposit. I called back asking them to let me see the water damage for myself, but the phones were either disconnected, or they were intentionally ignoring my calls. I haven't been able to get in touch with them since. Sketchy, probably illegal slumlord stuff going on here. DO NOT RENT FROM THIS PLACE.<//review>

<review>I lived here mid 2018-2019 and the apartments itself are really really nice and very spacious!! The walls and floor were pretty thick, which is a huge plus because a lot of apartments do not have that! There is a nice view of the M especially at the pool. Would love to live here again but the downsides to this place are lack of security, the amount of crime that would happen, seeing a bunch of homeless digging through trash, at least one of the gates was broken most of the time, and the parking was ridiculous. Idk if parking has changed since mid 2019, but residents would ALWAYS park in guest spots, there was never any parking and residents would even have to park on the streets! It would be terrible when it came to street cleaning days. Was on a wait list for a garage for several months. The wait list seemed to never move up. Some parents would always let their kids run wild all over the place which was annoying at times. There were lots of downs but there were also quite a few ups that are hard to find at other apartments!<//review><UserId.>108839375139859993787<//UserId.><Rate>3<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

AMAZING EXPERIENCE! I have to say that today I toured 5 properties including villas ! I am in town from out of state looking for housing due to a job opportunity that I will be taking in July and I was told that California was a total stuck up state(coming from Montana)  And I did get the feeling of rudeness at other properties but when I toured at villas I have to say that my perspective was changed! I had a million questions and of them were answered by Delsy and never did I get the feeling of her being annoyed she was so friendly and such and comfortable person to talk to! She even helped me picture furniture layouts inside the apartment tour ! WONDERFUL!  Loved my tour and experience! Thank you Delsy! I will be renting here in July without a doubt!< /text>

<Time>1579635956686< /Time><rating>3< /rating><text>------------- I'VE CHANGED MY REVIEW, SEE UPDATE AT THE END -----------------
I lived at Villas from 2017 until mid 2019 and my complaints are all about the new administration (2019). Our lease expired ~4 months after the transition between administrations happened. I understand it was a chaotic time for the new management and so I wont give too much heat about their lack of knowledge, the numerous amount of mistakes they made (overcharging us for rent, not maintaining the website) and how slow they were to get anything done. That and their lack of good service to their tenants made us decide not to renew the lease. We were told by a member of the management team that as long as we cleaned the apartment as clean or better than how we got it, we would get all of our deposit back –which is in accordance to California Law. So we did that, spent two whole days cleaning every corner of the apartment. To summarize, we did not get our deposit back, but instead we had to pay them for their cleaning fees, painting fees, etc. After arguing that this was not in accordance to California Law, they sent us pictures of a dirty apartment with holes and other damages claiming that that was our apartment, AN APARTMENT WITH A DIFFERENT LAYOUT THAN OURS! I had to go several times to their leasing office to try to get this issue fixed. In conclusion, they did every possible trick in the book to make us pay for unnecessary fees. Absolutely horrible management. Don't trust them.
-----------------------------------------UPDATE---------------------------------------------------------
After paying for those fees, they sent us to a debt collector. Bad move.
-----------------------------------------UPDATE---------------------------------------------------------
The Manager of Alliance Residential Company reached out and apologized on behalf of management. They also sent us our money back which we really appreciated. I hope this was just a hiccup in their system and hopefully they are doing much better. Other than that, the apartment was great and spacious, we really liked it. The pool and gym were great and always clean.</text>< Pics>

I've only been living here for 2 months and they have already cut the water off 3 times but not when they say they are such an inconvenience for my family and I, then when you call the office to ask about it they say "oh they ended up not doing it today we're going to send out another notice later." Not to mention there's always dog feces on the sidewalk so gross!!! Oh and did I mention the assigned parking is so far away from where you live, imagine trying to carry your newborn and groceries. And when you call to ask them to fix things they say oh let me check on that work order for you and never get back to you and they barely ever answer their phone or emails. Save yourself the time and money and move elsewhere because I can not wait for my lease to be up!!! Oh they include the water in the rent so your rent isnt the same every month and the water bill is based off of your building and how many people live in the apartment building.<//review>< Response>

They’re pretty good. Basic apartment living. My neighbor downstairs is old and won’t let you have guests over. She bangs on the floors (her ceiling) if she doesn’t like the way you walk. Management has done nothing about her and she doesn’t care at all. She keeps making up stories too. Be careful. Can’t wait till our lease is up in June.<//text>

My company put myself and my girlfriend up at these apartments for 3 months while working at a hospital close by. We haven’t had any issues. They’ve come for maintenance when we asked. They put new lights in the parking lot when I told them the lights were out. Our apartment has been great. We were told it has new carpet and paint. We haven’t had any problems with noise or pests. It’s been a great stay! I would definitely recommend.< /text>

<review>Been living here about 5 months and overall I enjoy it. The staff is nice and professional, the units actually look like what you see online, they make efforts to keep the complex up. For the most part the neighbors are pleasant.  My only gripe is loud music from balconies sometimes and cars in the lot constantly.  This is a nice place, we don't need anyone acting ghetto. There should be signs at the gates telling anyone who enters to keep their music at a respectful volume. Residents should be able to report anyone in violation by license plate or unit number.  I really hope management looks into getting a handle on that.  Otherwise it's great.< /review>< Pictures>

<Name>Sean Edwards< /Name><Time>1571700681570< /Time><Rate>1<//Rate><text>Absolutely horrendous. Moved in 3 years ago in 2016 and since day 1, have been lied to starting small now big. We moved out September 18th, before then I spoke with Chris, maintenance manager, and him and a Hispanic younger gentlemen who I was told was not there anymore told me and my fiancé that due to us being there for 3 years, the carpet did NOT need to be cleaned as it was going to be replaced and that we didn’t have to worry about anything.

Fast forward, we get our refund and they charged us for the carpet. I called in and gotten the run around. Left physical messages for call backs by the office people and have gotten NO call back from Chris. Call their corporate number, the first number they gave me was to a different company, apparently the lady didn’t want me calling their corporate. Called back and got a second number for corporate, Alliance Residential, and they said they don’t have a contract with Villas and that I had to take it up with them.

After calling and talking to 4-5 different people, finally got a hold of what I assume is the “head” or property manager. They’ve all said that the carpet had soil stains and needed to be replaced and that Chris never put in the notes that we were not going to be charged. When they talk to him, won’t let me, he continually tells whoever that he tells everyone “It depends on the life of the carpet whether or not you will be charged.” He specifically told US that we would NOT be charged. Now…..I will be finding out who this Tracy Madis from AllResco is, cause apparently the Villas Manager says that Alliance Residential still handles the inquiries, and file a formal complaint, possibly pending small claims litigation. Horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE management that has been swapped around NUMEROUS times in the three years we were there…< /text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1581534512469, 'text': 'Sean Edwards, we regret to hear that you had a negative experience with us, but would appreciate the chance to turn your experience around.

Lived in a super sweet 3 bedroom here. Rent was great, people are great, maintenance is great and very fast at responding. Everything in the apartment is sweet. Kitchen is big, even has a bar. All the amenities here are awesome too. Nice gym, coldest pool I've personally ever been in which is awesome considering how hot damn southern california is. People around here don't even bother you which is pretty cool and overall, its the nicest, cleanest apartment complex I have lived in.</review>

We lived on the 3rd floor and had a horrible ant problem every summer. Maintenance people would come and insist entry without notice. 50% of the time I try to call the front office no one answered the phone. After I moved out, they took my deposit and sent me a bill for $1000. I definitely would not recommend these apartments.<//Text>

Past tenant that just moved out effective 6/29. I have reached out to them several times on receiving my security deposit back and have been ignored I contacted the property manager Lynn Lopez she has not returned one call or responded to my email I contacted the corporate office residentcare they only provided me an email stating corporate does not have a contact number I have been ignored and received no response they took my security deposit and haven't received no response... community be aware where you choose to live I ran out of there so quick when my lease was up now I have one more thing I have to deal with is probably going court to get my security deposit back cause they have not responded.... extremely unprofessional: last email sent to the property manager and Alliance :

Hello
I have reached out to the property manager Lynn Lopez at Villa at town gate and have left several messages for Lynn I have not received a return call or response to my email. I ask the leasing agent Crystal who has been so kind if there was a corporate number or a manger I can speak with if Lynn is busy. She stated the residentcare email is the only information she had. I as well reach out to this email and have not received a response. This corporation has been extremely unprofessional and the residentcare email does not ring true it's clear you don't care about your residents no one from your corporation has contacted me on why I have not received my security deposit after 2 months. I returned all my keys on 6/29 and left the apartment in great condition, if this is how your corporation treat your tenants after they have lived there for a year and paid rent on time this is not acceptable you can't just take someone's money and never respond and ignore them with hopes they will go away well I won't go away you can't treat people this way and I will not let you steal my 450$ there is absolutely no way your corporation can justify not sending my deposit back within 21 days or even providing an itemized list and the community should know how your company treats their tenants after they move out. this is the 4th follow-up even left a message for a lady at the corporate office named Elena. If Alliance does not truly care about their residents shame on you but I will seek further action because I have not heard anything from you within the last 2 weeks of me reaching out

<rate>5</rate><review>I've lived here for 4 years and never once read any reviews but after being approached by someone I never met asking me to post a negative review for villas I was curious. I'm a little irritated by what I read. Yes ownership changed over a year ago and yes there's rules just like anywhere else I've ever lived. I have had nothing but positive experiences with the new people in the office and maintenance. Yes it took them a bit to get up to speed but we all do when we work somewhere new. Basically after reading the reviews I came to conclude that most of these people posting bad stuff were clearly in the wrong for something (educated guess). I saw one that was actually an old neighbor which I know got kicked out cause she didn't pay. Plus someone is soliciting negative comments cause the pool is closed. They shut down the pool and office to make it better for us tenants. I went into pay my rent and the office people were working in a construction zone doing their best to make sure all was being done right. They told me it's for a new office and they're gonna have games and a clubhouse where we can have parties for our family's and a new computer room and a pretty rad pool area. I don't agree with all the negative stuff posted here at all. I'm happy living here and I hope that other people disregard other people's drama.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1497635593952, 'text': "Stuart Gimpelson, we are very happy we could provide you with a positive experience!

<text>I absolutely loved living here. Staff is super accommodating and sweet, and they have the cleanest, biggest pool I've ever seen. They provide tons of perks for the residents as well. I highly recommend the Villas.

Office never answers their phone or returns calls.  Kids have taken over the pool area all times of the day unsupervised.  More ans more trash around the grounds. More times than not lately when I come home at night the carport lights are not working or perhaps they turn them off now not sure!  Our rent has gone up every year $100. But for what they aren't improving the living or maintaining the upkeep  like before!  We definitely won't be staying here after our lease is up!</Review>< Response>

<text>Not recommended. I can't wait for my lease to be over. Honestly for a company to take $75 for 37 min delayed on rent for paying online just shows how desperate these apartments are. They didn't even offer a 1 time waive for being late for rent for 37minutes pst . Today was the first time the apartments showed that we are not part of the villas family, today I felt like we were taking advantage of for 37 minute delayed on rent because of the system needed to add a second bank account. This will be 1 out many reviews to post regarding these apartments how 37 minutes for $75 .

< review>
Every other day there are homeless people digging around in the dumpster’s and at least once a week in broad daylight! In the last two months I’ve kicked out drug addicts underneath the stairs in the J buildings! And now too too it all off there are people breaking into cars to steal whatever they can. I lived in the J building for almost one whole year now and have never even seen security. You should expect ants and roaches to crawl out of the walls</review>

Villas at Towngate is an awesome apartment building! The apartments are very well taken care of and management does a great job keeping the building in excellent conditions. I highly recommend!</text>

Me and my wife used to love living here but since they recently changed ownership from Greystar to Alliance it has become horrible. We have lived here for 3 years and we wont be renewing our lease. I'm really disappointed with this new company. I hate to say this but it seems like it's getting ghetto. I would not recommend this place to anyone. John3:16</text>

The Apartments are cool, Management and Maintenance are nice. The only problem is that housein cost are going back up and that means apprtment prices are going up. My wife and I started at $950 now its $1200, we have 2 bed 2 bath and been there 4 years.If you have the money get a house way better investment.< /review>

Tonight was my final straw. I've been a resident at The Villas Apartments for 5 months now and I have had too many incidences happen that make me want to end my lease for good. My first experience was the horrible parking. There are residents here with family members that use the same visitor parking spaces as their OWN parking space on a daily which i find ridiculous. And NO ONE in management has done anything! Secondly, my boyfriend has to park on one of the main streets "Dracea" since that's the only parking in this complex. His car was broken into while parked on Dracea. Thirdly, I live on the 1st floor and it my apartment was broken into TONIGHT AS WE SPEAK. My boyfriend and I came back around 9:45am to notice my clothes tossed everywhere in my room. My reimbursement Ilroom was completely thrashed. Mattress completely thrashed. Pillows from my couch thrown all over the floor in my living room. You can tell they were looking for cash. They robbed me and thank God they didn't take my dog. But they stole a lot of my belongings. I called the police and they still haven't came, mind you it's 3am now, we called at 9:50pm the night before. Moral of the story, these apartments ARE NOT SAFE!!!! Do not take my review lightly. Strongly consider my experiences and avoid being a victim while you can.< /Text>

Be prepared to have a terrible relationship with management. They lack communication and updating tenants, it is almost impossible to get a hold of anyone during lunch hours (seems like they all have to go at the same time). Most of the people at the desk lack experience and will provide poor information about leasing apartments and what it is offered. Parking is terrible after 8, be prepared to wait  in the parking lot for some time waiting for someone to pull out.</Text>

The Villas At Towngate is my home and I'm happy I chose here for my first apartment. I love the layout of my apartment and I always get compliments on the pool area and kind staff.
My only complaints are NO pets, so I had to leave my cat at home with my mother; parking can be difficult, and parking can be hard to find sometimes. Keep in mind you get 3 passes for guests. Make sure they place them on their cars or they will be towed. There is also parking on the street and you could park at Winco and walk over to the Villas.
For a single woman stepping out on her own I have to say THANK YOU to the maintenance crew. They are always on top of it to help me. My air condition was acting up and they came early the next day to fix it. On another occasion a guest messed with my alarm system and it went off like crazy and wouldn't turn off. Maintenance and security came to make sure everything was okay and handled the minor emergency quickly. Maintenance are always polite and you can request they call before entering or allow them to enter while you're away. Security walks about sometimes but anytime I called they came quickly to either quiet a loud nuisance, etc. And the front desk is always helpful during their hours to handle minor concerns like neighbor disputes. This is a friendly location for all kinds of people from families to single occupants.
I might pay a bit more than the rest of the MoVal area for my one bedroom but I'm guaranteed safe. I left my door open accidentally one night and nothing bad happened. I've also never seen a vehicle broken into like other apartment complexes.<//text>

I talked to a couple residents in the building where you said my kids are being disrespectful .. oh bummer guess what.. they say it is not my kids they have problems with.. unfortunately my kids happen to have been there when you went down to see what the problem was. Unfortunate that you view my kids as disruptive and unruly because of the nearly 6 years that we've been residents here I've never had a complaint against us including my kids.. my son did say he was playing with a flat ball and that a resident asked him nicely to please be careful not to hit a car he said ok and stopped.. my kids were in the wrong place at the right time to take the fall for others disturbances.. my mother was watching them and can tell you how things played out.. so I guess just because you saw my kids downstairs playing you infact did not see them being disruptive and felt you could blame them for it. Of all the years I've lived here first time I'm super pissed off.< /review>< Pictures>

I miss Natasha.... im.glad we are moving out soon this place is getting gettho we've living here for almost 3 years quiet neighborhood and nice apartments but now I see policeman around 3-4 times as week....my car has broken into once.... gates are broken most of.the time so what's the point of being a gated community... there's ALWAYS anytime everyday a line of cars parked outside the gate waiting for someone to open the gate so they can come in..... again what's the point of being a gated community? ??? Pets not allowed???? I've seen everyday at least 4 -5 diferentes breeds of dogs.... peeing pooping in front of my patio and owners who doesn't clean after their dogs so I always see dog pop on the grass.... parking is a nightmare no enough open parking so if you have 2 cars either rent a garage port or park most of the time on the streets. New management hardly answer their phones.... they never sent an introductory letter .....nothing. Things are going bad here. We liked this place since the beginning but again is going bad..... good luck !</Review>

terrible officer!!!
I got a parking ticket 4 days ago and said I needed to clean my car and get a CA driver license plate cuz I just moved form WA. I cleaned my car and went to ask their officer (I do not know his name but he is a black guy) to get help. I made an appointment with DMV for changing the license plate, but it has to take two weeks to finish. I told him my situation and he said I could just park my car under the roof then everything would be fine! after 4 days, I found out my car got towed and I have to pay $411 to get it back!! I went to ask this officer why he lied to me!! He said he did not promise the car would not be towed, and then our vioce got high and he sarted yelling to me with extremly horrible attitude. He was poingting and yelling to me!!!! He even blamed on me and said it’s my fault!!! He kept saying he did not guarantee anything!!! He is a liar!!!!!!
I cannot believe it was really happening to me!! I am his resident but he treated me like his enemy and asked me to stand outside of his office!!
I am going to move out ASAP, I just cant stay in this apartment anymore! feel so sad after I walked out from the office and I was discriminated by him for sure.
DO NOT be a resident with this company!!!<//Review>

The management here is pretty terrible. I have called numerous times about my car being hit an scratched while being parked in my car port and never got a call back from the management in the front. We currently pay 1295 for rent and when we moved in our carpet was stained from the previous tenants and the doors had holes in them. We were told they would get replaced and it's been 7 months into or lease. Parking here is also terrible. There are very little open spots since they only offer one dedicated parking spot. The gates are also always broken letting random people come in and out all hours of the day. Security here is also very rude. Instead of patrolling the properity, they sit parked indront of the mail boxes sometimes asleep or not paying attention to what is going on around thwm. I would recommend to all to spend the money renting out a house than moving into this place.<//Text>

< review>
The one star is for what the property use to be! My family and I have been here since 2012, we use to enjoy living here. A few months ago Greystar sold the property to Alliance. This has been a horrible transition (if that's what you call it!) They took over about 3 months ago and still no update of information such as who we call for maintenance, security, tow company, or even a introduction letter.The office staff is extremely rude, never greet you when you walk in and never smile! It took 3 months to get rent statements, in fact this past month I didnt even recieve one and when I called to get my balance due the lady told me "maybe you should check your mail more" (I check it everyday).  The maintenance is a bunch of lazy, rude people too. The property use to have a landscaper that kept this place beautiful! The old maintenance was friendly and efficient. I really miss everyone from the old staff! Oh then there is the pets!!! We use to be a pet free community, apparently this changed but there has been no notification on this except this past week everyone got a notice on there door saying if pet poop is not picked up and disposed of properly there would be fines, funny thing is the onsite property managers dog poops in front of our building (E) and leaves it there!!! Its so gross and a pain in the butt with a toddler running around outside. I could go on and on but you get the point...This place once felt like an actual community and was a nice place to live. Unfortunately its turning into a garbage ghetto place to live and the staff is assisting in that process. We are looking forward to our lease being  up so we can leave!<//review>

<Text>The employees at the office are friendly, but don't let that fool you because their promises doesn't amount to anything. During my lease I became sick making it difficult for me to walk up to my third floor unit. So I went to the front office to speak to the office manager and her assistant Jessica. At first they seemed sympathetic in regards to my situation. They informed me that I can end the remainder of my lease due to illness. I was also told that I can only be charged for one month, if I can't find someone to rent my apartment or if my apartment remains vacant.  Fortunately, I found a person that has already been approved by them and had left a deposit for another unit. The person, known to me as Stephanie made appointment with the assistant manager Jessica to view a similar apartment since they cannot show  my apartment with me still living there. The prospective tenant, Stephanie, drove over thirty miles from Rancho Cucamonga to Moreno Valley for the appointment. Upon arrival she found the office doors locked with a notice saying that they will be right back. After waiting for nearly 45 minutes, she left. All phone call messages she left following, after the failed appointment, went unreturned. The Villas At Towngate action fraustrated her until she gave up on them. Later, I was told that they forgot that she had appointment with them. After I moved out, from my apartment, their accounts receivable clerk sent me a demand letter stating that I own them $4,637.36 because they have not being able to rent out my apartment and in addition, refused to refund my one month deposit. I later discovered that their real name of the parent company is Riverstone Residential Group doing business as "The Villas At Towngate." Please use prudent judgment in deciding if this is the type of landlord that you want to do business with.<//Text>< Pics>

I notice a lot of ants when I moved in. You cannot get rid of it whatever how many times you try. When you find you food and furniture are all ants, do not say nobody remind you. When you move out, the place will charge your half deposit.< /review>

Great Apartments! Maria, Cristal really try to help you out.
"The leasing office offers great service especially Maria."
Maria is very professional and always goes out of her way to help you in any way she can. She's been a great help since I first moved in here, and continues to help out anytime I have any issue.</Review>

We had Patrick perform our home inspection for a new purchase. He was on time, efficient, and went above and beyond what he was hired to do. He gave us tips on how to maintain our home, inspected extra items than what was on the standard list, and spoke to us over the phone to go through the report when he was done.

Very friendly, but professional at the same time! I would definitely recommend him to my family in the near future when they purchase their homes as well. We could not be happier with the service!</Text>

<Review>I called this company out to inspect and give ideas for how to treat wood boring beetles in my home. The tech came and inspected and said he would be getting back to me soon with treatment options, including tenting if necessary. A month later, no follow up at  all. I emailed the tech directly 9 days ago, and no reply. Guess I dodged a bullet after reading BBB complaints.</Review><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

<text>We had a home inspected by Greg Byrne this week. The experience beyond exceptional. He presented himself professionally and was very thorough with his inspection. He took his time to lay out all the facts and then was happy to review the details with us and answer any questions. We have two very young children and were concerned about purchasing a home with potential health risks, as it is an older home. He treated the home as if he was inspecting for his family to live there safely! I can not recommend this company and our inspector Greg enough!!<//text>< Pictures>

< review>
Used Twin Termite & Pest Control for over a year on a monthly basis.
Had a issue with the technician on the last two treatments so called the office and expressed my concerns and canceled my service,
At that time was told someone would be calling to find out what happened.... That call never came!
The following month receive a text that the technician would be coming the next day.
My experience with this company is this!
The technician was rude and disrespectful and when the office was informed of the issue they blew it off.< /review>

Home Inspector missed the fact that 700 sqft of the house was heated/cooled by a separate non-functioning HVAC unit.  Since there was a newer unit installed elsewhere he assumed this giant, rusted out unit was was just trash.  It was a hot Sacramento summer day somehow he missed the fact that a wing of the house was not cooling - no air out of the ducts.  He ignored the separate thermostat that controlled this unit and reported the whole house to have good air conditioning.  I now have an $8000 - $10000 issue for which I will be seeking a legal resolution.  The only offer from Twin was to say "sorry" and to refund the inspection fee.  It was straight up negligence on their behalf.< /review>

<Resp>{'time': 1532983368472, 'text': "Hi Troy,\n\nI'm sorry for the negative experience with us. I know the inspector as well as the home inspection manager have met with you since the initial inspection. The branch manager had also addressed the conditions via email which lead to the inspector possibly misidentifying the situation, as well as our liability.\n\nAs per the report, only 10% or less of the crawlspace was accessible. If the space were accessible, it is possible the inspector could had seen there were two sets of ducting, indicating the other unit was in service.\n\nOur liability policy is indicated on page 3 of the report:\n\n“An earnest effort was made on your behalf to discover all visible defects, however, in the event of an oversight, maximum liability must be limited to the fee paid. The following is an opinion report, reflecting the visual conditions of the property at the time of the inspection only. Hidden or concealed defects cannot be included in this report. No warranty is either expressed or implied. This report is not an insurance policy, nor a warranty service.”\n\nWe try to do the best visual inspection we can with the evidence given. That said, we don’t always get it right, and for that I apologize. As previously stated in the email, we’re more than willing to issue a full refund to you."}</Resp><gmapID>0x809ad8e0d8016bcb:0x3ebf206c064b00f0<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

He is attentive to my requests and responds quickly to messages, always answers my questions, and will come out if needed between my every other month service. (Like when micro ants invaded my home!)
The company also was flexible when I moved from Sacramento to Roseville.
Thank you, Soto!<//Text>< Resp>

<review>Frank and his team have been very professional and attentive to my needs as a Realtor. They have gone above and beyond  on numerous occasions giving my clients much more time in reviewing their home inspection and pest inspection findings than most companies would spend with a client.  I appreciate that very much.  You can feel very confident in getting nothing but A+ service every time.

Our inspector indicated some items completed and some not completed. Our inspector reported that he was offered some cash to overlook the items not completed which he did not accept and wrote up his re-inspection report correctly.\n\nWe received a call on 8/10 requesting another re-inspection.

<user_id>101196435517105273614</user_id><review>We strongly do NOT recommend Twin Home Services.

Brian Peak of Twin Home Services inspected our home in 2014. Had he properly inspected the windows, he would have seen that eleven of the retrofit windows were installed without the required framing, making water leakage inevitable. The absence of window framework can be visually determined, and should have been identified by Twin Home by sight.

Since this inspection, we have had major leaking of several of our windows, which caused substantial damage to our home, including cracking and warping of our walls.

We have had to hire a lawyer to recover costs (tens of thousands of $$) for window/house repair. After receiving a letter from our lawyer, we opened our home to Tim Hogge of Twin Home Services so he could do a visual inspection of the damage. Since that time, he has not responded to our lawyer's emails or phone calls, despite the obvious missing window frames and damage.

Our lawyer requested Twin Home Services' liability policy so we could pursue this matter with their insurance, and Twin Homes has refused to respond to this request.

Twin Homes is doing home inspections that are NOT thorough. They do not properly train their staff to pay attention to obvious structural problems. By their refusal to respond to our lawyer, they also are neglectful and lacking integrity.<//review><GmapID>0x809ad8e0d8016bcb:0x3ebf206c064b00f0</GmapID><Time>1530495835538< /Time>< Response>

Love this company! As a former employee i can say this was one of the toughest places to leave, they are like family. The owner Kyle Finley has worked very hard to make this great company what it is today, he know his success comes from the hard working and professional people that work for Twin. I know I can always count on Twin Home Services if I refer my clients, friends or family members to them. I highly recommend their services weather it's Pest Control, Termite or Home Inspections.</text>

We had our Home Inspection and Pest Inspection done last week and were very impressed by the level of services we received by the office staff and inspectors. They answered all our questions, were in no way alarmist, the pricing was very fair, communication was quick and clear. I would highly recommend them to anyone and will absolutely use them again in the future!< /Text>

The guy that came and dis work for us was very friendly and nice. My problem was with the billing. We had agreed verbally and in written about making 3 payment for the total price of 1,200 for one service. They removed the total price without authorization. I contacted the lead management and she wasn't able to help me because they didn't receive the correct paper and they couldn't do no corrections for whatever reason. Thankfully for Wells Fargo always coming through I love my bank they were able to help me and return the rest of the payment that I didn't agreed to and make it into 3 affordable payments. I don't recommend and would never get service here<//review>

Twin is a great company for your home inspection needs and also termite inspections. I have used twin for years and they don't miss any detail. My clients are also happy with their reports. If you are thinking about purchasing a home I would call Twin for your inspection needs. Frank Siino is always there to help you through each step of the way. Thanks Twin<//review>

<Review>As the owner of a real estate brokerage, our reputation is heavily affected by the performance of the other industry professionals we recommend.  For the last 6 years, I have recommended Kevin Hoepermans to my buyers for all home inspections because of his extensive industry knowledge and consistent stellar performance.  Not only does he provide thorough reports, but he treats my buyers with respect and makes himself available for questions any time after the inspection.  On more than one occasion, the clients on the other side of the transaction have also asked for his information because they wanted to use him on their own purchase after seeing what he found on their home.  Probably the only negative thing I can say is I hate it when I represent the seller and the buyer asks for a recommendation because I know he will find everything!<//Review><Response>None<//Response>< user_id>

After finally getting an offer accepted on a home my wife and I set out to find a company that could do our home inspection and pest inspection. After a doing a google search I came across several companies and I contacted several of the companies via email.  Kayla Reginato from Twin Home Services was the first to reply to my email. I advised Kayla that I was still looking around, so she scheduled me for a tentative appointment. I decided to go with this company because they had good reviews and a good price.

On the day of my inspection I was unable to leave work to be there for the entire inspection, but I did get there for the last 30 minutes, where I met my inspector James Davenport. James was great, he reviewed all of his major findings with me and he answered all of my questions.  I received my completed home inspection report with pictures via email within 5 hours after the inspection was complete.

I would definitely recommend Twin Home Services to anyone I know who is buying a home.</Review>

<review>The introduction inspection and spraying was great, but when it came to dealing with a rodent in the attic, we have had trouble getting ahold of the person responsible for pest control, including failed promises that we would be called back. The issue has dragged on for over six weeks, including a missed inspection date.

It's turned out that poison was placed for the rodent and the technician identified possible points of entry for us to close, but this information was never relayed back to us. We were getting ready to cancel our service when we just found this out. Frankly, there seems to be a significant issue with their inter-office communication (and given the industry and anticipated pay grade, I'm not blaming the technician here.)<//review><Rating>3</Rating>< username>

. Came to fix a leak over 6 months ago and its still leaking.  I got a wood distorying organism test and they just found some wood rot and a leak. Didnt even see the mold in plain sight. Sighting 8n our contract we dont do MOLD. They had to fix leak so they said they did and 2 month later still a leak and trying to get them back was hell. Hold he no answer there. Its a pain and dont use this company. Now i called Friday morning and told them and they told me they would call me right back after they talked. No call what so ever. So i calles them back and was toldd ill get a call tomorrow and they are not open on Saturdays. This company will lie and cheat ypu put of money so dont use them or your have to pay extra on things they miss because they just dont look. If i can add pictures everyone can see they just didnt look. Ill add pics on facebook. Forgot to say also they missed where  last owner work on drain for kitchen and old pipe white new back but leak like crszy if you hsve water on and they missed that and one hell of mess right now thanks to them.  Also if they see rat dropping or rodent in attic or crawl space they wont tell you unless you pay more so be warned!!!!!!< /text>

In January of this year, I hired Twin on behalf of the homebuyer I was representing to inspect the home she was in process of purchasing. The home was vacant at the time of inspection and Twin was hired to do a full home inspection. Not long after the completion of the purchase, we discovered what appeared to be mold growing on the ceiling of the living room. When we discovered this, we sent a contractor into the attic to check the area. The contractor was able to access the affected area of the attic without issue, in less than five minutes. He was able to clearly see that the plywood roof sheathing directly above the area of the moldy ceiling was wet and moldy as well. It seemed that this should have been noted by the home inspector as the attic was easily accessible and empty at the time of inspection. So, I contacted the home inspector and he said I would hear from his manager. Well, that didn’t happen. So I followed-up and finally received an email from the manager basically stating that Twin isn’t responsible as the issue was in the attic and the full attic was not inspected. I respond to this email with…Huh? You say that the accessible areas of the attic were inspected in your report. How was this area inaccessible to you? The contractor that discovered the issue had no problem getting to it… And I get no response whatsoever. In the meantime, the homebuyer has sent several emails as well, with no response. She even sent a certified letter with NO RESPONSE. You get the idea. Well, we finally get a response just a couple days AFTER the homebuyer writes a review on YELP! I guess that got their attention. So in JULY, they finally agree verbally to refund the cost of the home inspection to my homebuyer. But wait, then they tell me that they won’t give my homebuyer a refund unless she removes the YELP review! Here’s what the email said… “The reasons that we would be willing to refund the inspection fee are: 1) I'm not happy with our initial communication and response to your issue. 2) We have a win-win resolution. Your clients get money towards their expenses and we can turn an angry situation into a good one. IN THE PROCESS WE DO NOT SUFFER A POOR REVIEW. At no point during our discussions back and forth did anyone from Twin say that the homebuyers refund was contingent upon her removing her review from Yelp. Twin is clearly using refunds as a means to control their online reviews which shows just how unprofessional they truly are.< /text>

<review>These guys are great. If ever we have a problem eg ants etc they are very responsive and professional. Never leave a mess and always polite. We are lucky to have Anival Soto as our representative. He always calls a day ahead of our normal monthly maintenance to let us know he will be here. This give us time to make sure our pets are kept in the house while he sprays outside. They also clean away cobwebs outside our house. I highly recommend then to anyone who is seeking a pest control company. And if you are in Roseville area of California where we are be sure to ask for Anival. You'll be glad you did. Super friendly and has a very good work ethic. BTW I truly am a customer and have been for about two years now.</review>< Pics>

< Review>
Such a nice place for breakfast. Place and decor doesn't look like much but the key is the great food. My wife had the waffles with berries, I had the chicken and waffles. Both were on point. Our server was pleasant. We got a kick out of the 70's music playing in the background. We will come back for the food.<//Review>

Worst service ever. Very dirty n filthy establishment. Staff did not explain that you need a code to pick up my pizza and  they ignored me for an additional 10 minutes. Then said that they need to confirm that it’s my pizza as if I’m going to steal some random persons pizza. Very disappointed. Definitely NOT going back to this place. I left angry and frustrated. East 18th Street has way better service and food.< /Text>

It was when I took my pizza home.  Iv reheated a little Caesars pizza before and know for a fact my stale pizza was old and reheated. It did not even look appealing. Took a couple of bites and was too disappointed to eat and now my stomach is acting up. Took pictures of this abomination of a pizza and its clearly old. The cheese is discolored and rubbery. If I get sick I'm gonna sue this establishment</Text>< pics>

Who doesn't love a good deal on pizza at that. They only messed up on our soda we wanted that we purchased as we were leaving. Pizza was hot and fresh and right now if you order online they got a coupon for free breadsticks. Its okay sometimes to just order the bread sticks and sauce, I do it all the time there addictive. Staff was great and made sure my oder was correct before leaving. If you order online super quick and ready when you get there.</Text>

<text>The worst service I have ever encountered!!!! The girl at the register asked me can I help you, so I say two bags of garlic sticks, so instead of getting my order she turns around goes to the back where you can see everything and starts getting pizzas ready for the box and starts cutting the pizzas, tthen she starts filling other orders, I eat this for about 3 minutes when I ask what about my order, she says there were others ahead of me, I asked why then did you ask me what I want, and the garlic bread was ready and only 4 feet away from us, she didn't care and she didn't speak English very well either, I just turned and left. Another food establishment where the counter person doesn't say hello may I please help you with a smile. Unacceptable!!!</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

I bought a 5$ lunch combo today and I usually buy them at Brentwood but I was in Antioch and decided to buy a combo I was unfortunate to have went there and bought this combo the pizza was disgusting and tasted like if it was made 2 days ago my friend took one bite of it because I thought I was the only one with this taste and my friend immediately threw up and I ate one slice and threw the rest away because It tasted badly I hope you guys actually do your pizzas right and fresh because I’m always buying lunch combos at the same time and place which is in Brentwood and they taste amazingly fresh and good first time buying the 5$ combo at this place never will again 😕< /review>

Pizza was cold, and dry. So I guess they just had it made and happy I ordered the same one. And no, it was not a Hot and Ready. It was a Legit pizza. So I expect it to be made to order. But whatever. Jalapeño Cheese Sticks were bomb that's why it gets 3 stars. Hahaha< /review>< username>

It was about a minute later that they came over to take my order. After talking to the greeter , she told me 7 minutes and went to the back to presumably make my order. After a few people came in to pick up their order 7 minutes had elapsed. it would be another 10 minutes before I would get my order. And when they handed it to me, they just threw it on the table and the lady walked off.  I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK TO THIS LOCATION EVER.</review>< Time>

Not enough meat on pizzas,  for some reason there is no portion control in this store.  Customers needed to ask for receipts because they don't give you one.</review>

This place is definitely worth the wait. Right off the main strip with more outside seating than inside. Omelettes are huge, fruit is fresh and he kept my coffee full the entire time. Can be on the pricier side for brunch but it’s Huntington so naturally you know what to expect. Thanks for the great service! All the best< /text>

It looked good, the hamburger was covered with mushrooms onions and green peppers. It just needed more flavor and the gravy needed something also. My wife had the Kepplers special, she liked it but it was cold.< /Review><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<text>This place was great! Out waiter was nice and we got our orders fairly fast. Our meals were big for a good price. I had the peanut butter shake and was surprised at how big it was. As someone that is concerned about the virus we were glad they had a small table inside that was away from all the people eating outside. They did a nice job at accommodating us in that aspect. If they would not have been able to accommodate us we would just gotten the food to go, no big deal. We'll definitely come back.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< gmapID>

Great food and drinks along Main Street, Huntington Beach. Don't forget your swimsuit and towel if you just want to feel the sand between your toes. Fun for bikes and roller skates if you got some. PCH tends to get heavy traffic on weekends, there's coin parking, and parking structures. A wonderful Beach community that holds surfing competitions that's always fun to watch.< /Text>

This restaurant is my preferable place.  Of all restaurants I know I prefere it most. I always suggests to my friends to go to visit this restaurant. when  I I need a proper dinner, this is the place that comes right away to my head.  Great and many types of  food and a rich cuisine.trained staff members, and pleasant ambience. Not less important, the charge is modest. I tell about this spot with no hesitation.< /review>

<Review>Hello there!

On day three of our trip to California, we decided to head to Huntington Beach for the day. We really enjoy Huntington Beach and it was only a 30 minute drive from our hotel in Anaheim.  The beach is great and the local shops are fun to browse and the even the neighborhoods are nice to take a stroll through.

Of course, we wanted to eat, something my husband and I do well, and often, especially on trips.

As we walked Main Street to make our decision of where we would eat, we decided on Sugar Shack Cafe at 213 Main Street, Huntington Beach, CA.

Since it was breakfast, not that it matters, my husband opted for the Spanish Omelet and I had the Kepper's Benedict.

We both agreed that the Keeper's was better than the Spanish Omelet. The sauce that was on the omelet was not that great. It tasted and looked like a watery tomato juice. Even the flavor of the omelet was not that great.

We sat outside and enjoyed watching people pass by as we ate.

The service was there, the hostess and waitress were nice and the atmosphere was great. Being from Tucson, we are not fans of sitting outside to eat - the heat is a little much but in Huntington Bach sitting outside was enjoyable with the breeze and the temperature.

All in all it was good. Just a little disappointing in the omelet. Little flavor and some watery sauce.< /Review><userid>101860354992201750199</userid>< GmapID>

Altho a "regular" breakfast spot near the beach on Main St with eggs and the basics, Sugar Shack is far from regular with basics.

From some of the far better menu items to almost everyone working there being far from average, this place gets my 6 star rating!

When I say far from average people, from some of the best surfers in HB & beyond to people who care, going beyond the typical call of server duty to ensure your time there is pleasant, your food is served quickly, comfortably and your coffee is full!< /text>

Sugar Shack Cafe is a great place to have breakfast in Huntington Beach.  The servers are friendly, the food always comes out quick and hot, and they don't skimp on the food they serve you.

There are three dining areas on the premises.  The first and most notable is their front patio.  This is a great place to people watch.  You may have to sign in and wait, to sit in this area, as it's the most popular.  Inside is always cramped, but they have some great old surfing photos of Huntington Beach on the walls to gander at.  There is a fairly large patio in the back, where you usually won't have to wait to be seated.

My favorite here is a ham, mushroom & Swiss cheese omelette.  This beauty comes out oozing with cheese, packed with smoky ham steak chunks and sliced sauteed mushrooms.  Very buttery tasting, as well.  YUM.  Hash browns are perfectly golden brown & crispy.

My wife and I would come here early on the weekend, whenever we were headed to Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve, to do some birding.  If you can get here around 8am on weekends, then you'll beat the rush.  Parking can be difficult to find on Main St., but they do have several parking garages close by on Main St., just north of the Sugar Shack, one on each side of the street.

They are also famous for their French toast here.  So yummy!</Review>

<text>Excellent breakfast in the heart of Huntington Beach. But minus 1 star because they switched their homemade cinnamon roll to store bought instead! I highly recommend Keppler's special. Also their omelettes are amazing. They're French style, folded over omelettes with the ingredients in the middle, rather than having the ingredients baked into the eggs like most places do. Their shredded hash browns are nicely seared with butter. The coffee is average. By the way they have a back patio, in case the front patio is full.< /text><UserId.>101098721493984306069<//UserId.>< Time>

Hello there!

On day three of our trip to California, we decided to head to Huntington Beach for the day. We really enjoy Huntington Beach and it was only a 30 minute drive from our hotel in Anaheim.  The beach is great and the local shops are fun to browse and the even the neighborhoods are nice to take a stroll through.

Of course, we wanted to eat, something my husband and I do well, and often, especially on trips.

As we walked Main Street to make our decision of where we would eat, we decided on Sugar Shack Cafe at 213 Main Street, Huntington Beach, CA.

Since it was breakfast, not that it matters, my husband opted for the Spanish Omelet and I had the Kepper's Benedict.

We both agreed that the Keeper's was better than the Spanish Omelet. The sauce that was on the omelet was not that great. It tasted and looked like a watery tomato juice. Even the flavor of the omelet was not that great.

We sat outside and enjoyed watching people pass by as we ate.

The service was there, the hostess and waitress were nice and the atmosphere was great. Being from Tucson, we are not fans of sitting outside to eat - the heat is a little much but in Huntington Bach sitting outside was enjoyable with the breeze and the temperature.

All in all it was good. Just a little disappointing in the omelet. Little flavor and some watery sauce.< /text>

<Text>This is a popular place and we had to wait a bit, not unexpected. Once we placed our orders, the service was pretty fast and friendly. The food is good, but I wouldn't say it was exceptional. My friend said her food was cold. Prices are fairly high, but this is a beach venue so not surprising. I might come back, not sure at this point.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

The Steak & Eggs with Hush Puppies & Gravy were a great deal.

<Text>Hash browns lacked flavor. My pregnant wife was worried about how they cooked her hard boiled eggs  (pictured) and the chicken was very under whelming (zero seasoning).  Our guest said the eggs Benedict was good but that was about all. Had very high hopes but sadly this place missed the mark.</Text><Date>1535744175910<//Date>< Resp>

Excellent breakfast choice!

We went with a large group and ordered a ton of stuff and everyone was super happy with their food.

There’s usually a line so best to get there early.< /text>

It was busy at 8:30am and they got us in right away. We had drinks & menus almost instantly and food was to us in a few minutes. Breakfast was delicious! The staff was polite & friendly even while hustling. Will go back again during this vacation!</Text>

< Review>
Good location for enjoying the beach area. There are tables outdoors, and some are right on the street during Covid pandemic. The Main st is blocked to through traffic so indoor tables can move outside. Food is hit and miss. Good Eggs Benedict, bad stakes. This is a very popular restaurant in the morning and afternoon, with line and waitlist most of the time.< /Review>

So worth the money, friendly, and at 8am it was peaceful on the street, so enjoying a solid cup of coffee was the best! Go next time you are there, but get there before 9 for a calming experience ♡ Food was stellar and so was their hit sauce selection!<//text>

Always the best, always consistent, always treating everyone so great, and the menu is fantastic!!!  I lost 12 pounds pounds during the pandemic because they were closed!! I made up for it today!! Try spuds with breakfast or lunch, all Michelle's food is top quality from breakfast to lunch. Primo.</review>

Great portions, good food. Nothing spectacular, but it was good. The inside is pretty tight and small! Our server also kept forgetting things we asked for, but it was REALLY busy. I am surprised they actually have a bathroom. I would visit again. It had great ambiance and is apparentlya local institution!< /Text>

<text>Great breakfast and pretty good prices. I ordered the eggs Benedict and a coffee and my daughter ordered pancakes. Both items came out quickly and were hot with good flavors. Server was very lovely and attentive as well.This was my first time visiting the Sugar Shack Café. I came to this restaurant because I read a magazine article (I can't remember which one) stated it was the best breakfast spot in Huntington Beach.< /text>< Pictures>

Food was cooked as it should be, we ordered fairly simple breakfast items and it came out great.  Servers were very nice, but food items didn’t come out together.  So my toast came after I had finished my eggs and hash browns.</Review>

The food is always good and sitting outside on a nice day is the best. There is always a line to get in, so be prepared to wait to get a table. Well worth the wait. Since we live in Huntington Beach, we go there with guests. Large portions, prompt service, outdoor patios in front and back. Reasonable prices for the area. Popular for breakfast any time during the day.</Review>

This was my first time visiting the Sugar Shack Café. I came to this restaurant because I read a magazine article (I can't remember which one) stated it was the best breakfast spot in Huntington Beach. After trying it, I think they have a solid argument here. The environment is definitely geared towards a younger crowd with a fast-paced feel to it, but the staff is very friendly. My meal was a pretty large portion, which I appreciate, and was delicious.</text>

Great breakfast and pretty good prices. I ordered the eggs Benedict and a coffee and my daughter ordered pancakes. Both items came out quickly and were hot with good flavors. Server was very lovely and attentive as well.<//review>

<Text>Cool vibe and excellent service. Sometimes food is so good you just keep eating after you are full, this is not that kind of food. It looks good and is served hot and while the hash browns were crispy, they were a bit too greasy. The omalett was just OK and even my 10 year old son that ears anything did not eat even half of his food. I would skip Sugar Shack for breakfast.<//Text><response>None<//response><username>Aristides Ioannides</username><time>1569517596961<//time></record>

<Text>This is a fun place to enjoy breakfast or lunch when visiting Surf City.  You should go at least once, it is a local institution, ;c)   Tables on the sidewalk out front are great for people watching.  The back patio is my favorite though, nice and shady. There is usually a waiting list but it goes fast and is worth it. The comfort food breakfasts are really very good and substantial.  A good value for the price as well.  Friendly, fast service is consistent.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd214162ec8ced:0x7ffe8c595904074f<//Gmap_id></record>

Absolute best place for breakfast in the area.  Great food, very efficient and friendly staff, a very pleasant place for a leisurely breakfast with family and friends.  We've been multiple times and always make a point of visiting whenever we are in Huntington Beach.  Can't wait to go back.<//text>

<review>Pros: Friendly and attentive service (our coffee was never empty), shockingly clean/modern bathroom, hearty portions of good-quality breakfast!

Cons: Do not sit in the back patio of the restaurant around 8-9am on Mondays unless you like the sound/ambiance of dump trucks. Frankly, I'm shocked they let us sit out there during that time without any warning.</review></record>

<text>Kepler's special is my favorite here. Great place for breakfast or brunch. Pretty busy on weekends, for fastest seating have your party split up and put your name down in the front and the back (usually back is faster), but if you want to people watch then sit out front.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

It is a very good spot. I think highly of the breakfast. the staff is always very friendly and helpful.

It is a great location just 2 blocks from the pier.  I recommend sitting outside. Enjoy.< /Review>

<Rate>3< /Rate><text>I’ve been coming to Sugar Shack for years now. Always a great breakfast and has always been very reasonably priced until my recent visit. I’ve always been a fan of their tuna. I ordered a tuna sandwich with alfalfa sprouts in lieu of lettuce, pickles, a side of fruit in lieu of French fries that come with the meal and a cup of coffee.  My total was $18.48!  I told the waiter the bill couldn’t be mine because I just had a tuna sandwich and it was $10.50 on the menu. I was aware the fruit was an extra of $1.50 instead of the fries. Not sure why they would charge for the fruit instead of just having a choice between fries and fruit.  I was charged another $1.25 for the alfalfa sprouts instead of lettuce and .65 cents for the pickles. I didn’t order it with avocado because that would have been another $1.75 extra. While questioning the breakdown of my bill because I was in awe of the amount for a tuna sandwich our waiter comments to my friends daughter he found it “Amusing” that we were questioning both our bills! I found that extremely rude and insulting to make that comment!  I can’t speak for everyone but I work hard for my money and have the right to question every penny if I choose to do so for clarity! I’d like to see the shack keep reasonable prices because that is a major reason they’ve been so successful and a staple in our great city! Shame on you rude waiter!<//text>< date>

<Review>Great little breakfast joint in the heart of downtown Huntington Beach.  The food was good...a little pricey for what you get.  Expect to wait a bit for a table.   Service was friendly and the atmosphere was relaxed.  I've been eating here for 45+yrs...I'm glad they're doing so well and always try to go wherever I'm back in town.<//Review></record>

My husband and I were in the Sugar Shack yesterday 9.13.19 for an enjoyable breakfast, when our order came it was very concerning. There was obvious mold on the two slices of bread, the eggs were under cooked and it continues from there. As my husband was eating he realized the food seemed very off and he first sent the toast back, the waiter noticed the mold and was nice about accepting it back. Another server brought back more toast however, it was evident it came from the same loaf just at the tail end.
My dish did not taste fresh and I left all of it behind. My husband had eaten one of the two eggs and left his meal aside. We payed our bill and left very disappointed as we have been residents in HB for 3 decades.
Shortly after, my husband became violently ill, unable to function. He was taken to the ER after a half day of torture and the doctor confirmed it was a food borne illness. I called the restaurant today hoping to notify the owner and I was told he is never around.
I am urgently writing this message because I do not want any person or child to go through what my husband just experienced. Food poisoning can be extremely dangerous.
If you are the owner reading this please FIX IT,  you are putting our community in danger. Thank you! MM</text></record>

Used to love going here for weekend breakfasts before departing for home. Yesterday, 06/16/2019, we waited an hour in the stinky alley in the back to be seated. I was stunned by the prices which have literally doubled! $10 for two pancakes, two very small strips of bacon, and one egg is hardly worth the wait or the popularity of this once iconic place. Final tab? Over $100 for six adults and a baby. It’s IHOP or Denny’s from now on—if I really have a pancake craving at the beach again. Totally unimpressed.<//Review>

<text>If you are local or from out of town this is the place to go for breakfast.  The ice tea has the fun chewable ice from my childhood. They have yummy ham and cheese omelets with American  cheese. They also have amazing french toast. Great service, great food, great atmosphere.  This is the place the locals go.  Make this a stop on your vacation.</text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<text>Sugar Shack is the true staple of breakfast places in downtown Huntington Beach. You get tasty food for a decent value, huge portions, and you're by the sea.

Their food is pretty much diner food. Nothing fancy but it satisfies hungry people happily. Their hash-browns cannot be beat. Their "surf" (half hot chocolate half coffee drink) is my guilty pleasure.

Whether you want a simple two egg breakfast with toast or something for a bigger appetite they have it all. I've had every kind of breakfast imaginable there and have not been disappointed.

They have outdoor seating both front (on Main St.) and back (in alleyway), as well as indoor seating. The indoor seating is first come first serve even on busy days.<//text><gmap_id>0x80dd214162ec8ced:0x7ffe8c595904074f</gmap_id><Pictures>None</Pictures><username>Deanna Fountain</username><rate>4<//rate></record>

<review>URGENT/ BE AWARE!
My husband and I were in the Sugar Shack yesterday 9.13.19 for an enjoyable breakfast, when our order came it was very concerning. There was obvious mold on the two slices of bread, the eggs were under cooked and it continues from there. As my husband was eating he realized the food seemed very off and he first sent the toast back, the waiter noticed the mold and was nice about accepting it back. Another server brought back more toast however, it was evident it came from the same loaf just at the tail end.
My dish did not taste fresh and I left all of it behind. My husband had eaten one of the two eggs and left his meal aside. We payed our bill and left very disappointed as we have been residents in HB for 3 decades.
Shortly after, my husband became violently ill, unable to function. He was taken to the ER after a half day of torture and the doctor confirmed it was a food borne illness. I called the restaurant today hoping to notify the owner and I was told he is never around.
I am urgently writing this message because I do not want any person or child to go through what my husband just experienced. Food poisoning can be extremely dangerous.
If you are the owner reading this please FIX IT,  you are putting our community in danger. Thank you! MM</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Sunday morning are fun! I went in with my daughter and the service was great! Our table was sticky and gross!  I order the bacon  avocado omelette with American cheese! Sounded so good! The omelette was so oily!!! The top of it had a little piece of cheese and bacon the bacon was under cooked on top the little ripped off cheese looked like it totally didn't belong there! I cut the omelette open and it had the most burnt bacon all in one corner and the cheese inside wasn't melted it all. The toast came out under cooked and the  butter  wasn't melted of course because the toast wasn't toasted!  The hash browns came out like 5 minutes late.  Long story sure wish I would've just made food at home!  The cook is to blame!!!</Text>< Pics>

Really big pancakes, great burrito, and great french toast. Great prices too. Couldn't believe this was in Cali... 🌴<//review>< pictures>

<Text>love the sugar shack - I always grab the main street breakfast burrito. The great thing about this place is they pump out breakfast food pretty quick. there is usually a wait on the weekends, sometimes very long wait, but the staff is pretty cool and the food is decent. If you want a place you can get your food like 5 minutes after you order it, come to this place.</Text>< user_name>

Great breakfast burritos and more, but you won’t need more because the burritos are huge. Great service, cool patio in front and back ( we chose back because of shade and less wait).< /Text>

There was a line out front, but noticed a sign that said more seating in back. Went back there and there was a smaller line. We were seated in a few minutes and enjoyed the weather. Really big pancakes, great burrito, and great french toast. Great prices too. Couldn't believe this was in Cali... 🌴<//Text>< Pics>

The food is a favorite for breakfast in HB. For some reason though I smelled garbage when I was sitting in the back eating area. We moved tables but I could still smell it. The new awning in the back is nice. The Kepler and the french toast are my top picks.</review>

Great breakfast burritos and more, but you won’t need more because the burritos are huge. Great service, cool patio in front and back ( we chose back because of shade and less wait).<//Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>This is a great place. It's been around since 1967. They only serve breakfast and lunch but somehow have managed to stay in business when so many others have gone out or business. It's a local spot that has the support of the community. The food is really good and I've tasted most things on the menu over the years. It's always packed so get here early. It's worth the wait. They have a back seating area that usually is less packed than the front that has a view of main Street.</Review>< Pics>

<review>Read great reviews so I was excited to eat breakfast there. Staff was wonderful and very helpful with letting us know what was good on the menu. Food arrived and it looked great...but once the eating began, huge let down. Very underseasoned for both the breakfast burrito and their version of the eggs benedict. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is the pancake and french toast. Those were INCREDIBLY GOOD!<//review>< date>

<text>I would have given this place 3 stars instead of 1 if the manager had not come out to argue with me about the temperature of the food.

My order came out wrong and I let that slide. Mistakes happen.

It was corrected right away but when the food came out, it was cold. I sent it back and just asked for the check for my drink.

Manager came out and insisted the food had been hot when he checked it. I proceeded to inform him it was not and it did not taste very well.

He kept grumbling as if I was at fault...

Horrible customer service on his part.

Will not return.</text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd214162ec8ced:0x7ffe8c595904074f<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

One suggestion make biscuits and gravy everyday not just Saturday and Sundays, almost was a deal-killer.</Text>< pics>

OMG! Ah! Yum! Yummy! So. Much. Fun. So many completely fun and "exotic" flavor combinations. What quality too - honestly - you can taste it. Service was excellent - so patient in answering any questions and giving a few samples. They have a flight though! That's awesome. It's great. Even if you're full from a meal, you've got to try this if your there.< /review>

<Text>Loved this place!!! I had biscuits and gravy with hash browns, and everything was delicious. The staff was super friendly on a chill Sunday morning, and the decor was fun. But I'm from a landlocked state, so pictures of sharks and surfers tend to hold a certain allure for me.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Atmosphere was casual, awesome outdoor seating in the midst of the hustle and bustle of main street - perfect for socializing/people watching. The service was fast and friendly.

We went for lunch and couldn't resist trying "The Charger" - a yummy combination of grilled chicken breast, avocado slices, bacon, lettuce, tomato, cheddar and Monterrey cheeses, accompanied by hearty sides of buffalo and ranch sauces with crispy, thick,crinkle-cut fries on the side.

The sandwich was good but with the combination of sauces it was GREAT... and they serve breakfast all day....I'll have to go back ..</Review>

<rate>2<//rate><review>This will be an unfair review since we didn't eat here. Of course this was supposed to be a great breakfast spot.  When I got to the door and peaked in it looked cozy and the food smelled good.  Unlike their neighbors on this main street, they took a hard line of no pets. They did not take the time to even entertain the notion of tying up our 4 month old golden retriever outside to a post  adjacent to the sidewalk. They were more impressed by pointing out all the signage that stated their pet policy.

It's ironic that a beach town that supports a dog off leash beach policy just north of main street would make it nearly impossible to enjoy the town eating with your four legged friend.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80dd214162ec8ced:0x7ffe8c595904074f< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Amazing breakfast burritos that we still try to make at home! This place opens early for all the surfers. Fast moving line/wait, but we didn't feel rushed once seated. Good service, handled special requests well. Would love to return!!<//Review>

Meal was excellent. Service was very good. We never waited for anything and never rushed. Waitress Katie was very attentive and helpful. We will be back thanks to Chef Jason and his staff. Thanks Jason for a very nice experience.</Review>

One of my favorite breakfast places!  Wish they were more dog friendly though with outside seating since it's common for people to have dogs there.< /Text>

<text>Beachy breakfast, home style. Early birds can enjoy the morning quiet of Huntington Beach while gnoshing on American fare breakfast. Cramped interior adds to the atmosphere. Outdoor tables available. If you rise in HB, you might take a shine to this place.

<Text>I had the Keppler's breakfast special and it was fantastic. The hash browns were perfectly cooked and the bacon was nice and crispy. Excellent service and excellent food.
I have since gone back and tried and omlette that was very tasty.
Get here early if you want to grab a close parking spot, but you will not be disappointed.</Text>< Rating>

Love this place! Layed-back, surfer and locals hang out. Yummy, simple American food. Especially good breakfast food. I stop in after my morning runs on the weekend. Well worth the wait. Ah, and there are 4-5 Brazilians working there, a Spaniard too, so it's a cultural treat as well.<//Review>

<review>Popped in for an impromptu brunch date on a Monday morning. The weather was finally sunny and we had opted to sit on the patio. Note: They do offer 2 patio areas. While the main (front) patio area is the most popular choice, they also have a back area covered patio as well.

I found our table to be pretty dirty for a restaurant. There was definitely a lot of food on the floor under our table which was a little gross to me. Looking past that, we placed our food orders...

We ordered the main street burrito and the keppler's. Both items came out pretty fast after we ordered. The food was okay, but nothing great and nothing that left me thinking wow - I have to have more of this.

The service was friendly, but we felt like we lost our waiter a few times.

Overall, the food was okay, but nothing that was amazing for me to come back again and gloat about.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dd214162ec8ced:0x7ffe8c595904074f</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Huge portions and good food. There was a wait on Sunday, but it wasn't too long and there were lists for the front patio as well as the rear eating area, both of which were outside. Inside was first come, first served.</review>

A one of a kind breakfast spot. Definitely not a place that tastes like the average small diner. They have a big back patio, small inside seating, and a front patio on main Street HB. I always recommend my customers from out of town who are searching for a good breakfast or lunch.<//Review>

Sugar shack was a great place for breakfast. It was the right place at the right time during our vacation.  The food was tasty and the staff was very friendly.  We did have to wait for a table outside but with nowhere else to for the day, the wait was not a problem.<//review>

There was limited seating, even though they had some in the back, the food was pretty good, but the service was a little slow. We had to wait a while to even get served. Other than that it's worth giving it a try, but we probably won't be back here<//review>

So if you're hungry for breakfast and want to eat eggs, bacon, etc this may be good enough. The quality of the food is very similar to something one can cook at home.  They have terrible customer service. I saw one of the waitresses stealing condiments from occupied tables to give to her tables?! Very, very tacky.  If you go on a weekend prepare to wait standing up to be seated.</Review>

Sugar Shack offers a good selection of breakfast items with very generous portions.

Plus, there's something on the menu for everyone, from the straightforward "eggs and bacon" types to those looking for healthier and lighter breakfast options.

The food was prepared well and the wait for both seating and food was minimal, despite mornings being fairly busy here due to the joint's increasing popularity.  The service was adequate and coffee was refilled when needed.

During busier times, this place is best suited for couples and smaller groups of 6 or less.

All in all, it's not the fanciest place to eat on the strip, nor is it the next taste sensation, but Sugar Shack is definitely good at what they do and that's delivering above-average breakfasts at a fairly reasonable price (considering the area)!<//text><Rating>4<//Rating>< user_name>

best after surf breakfast in hb! after getting some waves you can always count on there being other surfers here talking about their surf sessions as well. they have the best hash browns ive ever had. food always comes out super quick. I'm a huge fan of the "main street breakfast burrito"< /Review>

Fun little place to sit outside on the sidewalk and people watch. The back patio has it's charm but the overwhelming odor of refuse can be jolting as it occasionally wafts in the direction of patrons. The food is average tasting and there are plenty of choices. Don't try to communicate a food allergy, however. The message of needing to have NO dairy,  communited more than one time, didn't get  through and my vacation was cut short by three days as I recovered from the unfortunate effects. I won't be returning but give this place a try at least once and decide for yourself.<//review>

<Review>I dont know if it still is, but about a year ago it was on a couple different lists for being one of the top breakfast places in the OC. While I dont exactly agree with that, I will say their food is decent. Also, it's hard to know which server is yours. I've come here 3 different times, and each time I've gone, I've been waited on by 3-4 servers, which just means they are disorganized< /Review>< Pictures>

Everytime I'm near huntington beach I feel obligated to go to the sugar shack. I love the breakfast. Most recently I had the chili omlette. It's delicious. Service was pretty quick and responsive on my recent visit. The only time I couldn't find my server was when I was ready to pay. But who can complain about sitting outside on a beautiful day in Huntington waiting to pay the bill. Always great food and a fantastic location.< /Review>

They got rid of their homemade cinnamon rolls. After coming here for 20+ years, I’m officially disappointed. The new ones are inedible.</Text>

< Review>
Love going to the Sugar Shack! Went this past weekend and disappointed to experience they have gone cheap on something like Ketchup! May not be a big deal to some else but when you like it on scrambled eggs, omlettes, hash browns or fries it makes a difference. It was like soup and ruined the meal experience. I don't mind refillable bottles like they have on the table for the ketchup. Just don't refill them and try to pass it off as no one will notice or care. If they cut corners there where else are they cutting corners? Charge me a few cents more but don't go cheap! I work in the restaurant industry and know the difference between condiment qualities. This was the cheapest you can buy. Sorry to have to write this post!<//Review>

Everytime we go here the food is fantastic, served quickly, and reasonably priced. Service is also always quick and friendly. Outside patio seating makes this a great "beach" cafe environment. Definitely a must visit if you are in HB and want that classic beach town breakfast stop!<//Text>

Quaint & cozy cafe with surf vibes serving comfort American breakfast. There's plenty of outdoor seating in the front & rear.  I recommend the Keppler esp if you're a fan of english muffins-super delish. The servers were sweet & welcoming. They're good about re-filling your coffee too.  Bonus: a hop & a skip away from the beach.</review>

<Review>I was in HBCA for meeting and since I am from the Central Time Zone--I was up Very early. I stumbled upon this place, and could not have been happier. Typical breakfast fare--but the food was outstanding. Service was great. Around 830am it got real packed. I would eat there today if I was in HBCA.</Review><rate>5< /rate><resp>None<//resp><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Love going to the Sugar Shack! Went this past weekend and disappointed to experience they have gone cheap on something like Ketchup! May not be a big deal to some else but when you like it on scrambled eggs, omlettes, hash browns or fries it makes a difference. It was like soup and ruined the meal experience. I don't mind refillable bottles like they have on the table for the ketchup. Just don't refill them and try to pass it off as no one will notice or care. If they cut corners there where else are they cutting corners? Charge me a few cents more but don't go cheap! I work in the restaurant industry and know the difference between condiment qualities. This was the cheapest you can buy. Sorry to have to write this post!< /Review>

Nice place but the cook needs some additional training. Very greasy and eggs were first way under cooked, then after I sent them back, he overcooked them. It wasn't very busy so I'm sure he was just inexperienced or just didnt care. Either way, I'll not be returning. For the price and lack of quality, youd be better served going to IHOP across the street.< /review>

Typical breakfast fare--but the food was outstanding. Service was great. Around 830am it got real packed. I would eat there today if I was in HBCA.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dd214162ec8ced:0x7ffe8c595904074f<//gmap_id></record>

<Time>1499190106370< /Time><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>This place is SWEET! One of the things I was most upset about when we moved from Massachusetts was losing the breakfast joint that we often frequented (ya know, right after moving away from my family! Lol). If there is any meal that my little family likes to go out for, it's definitely breakfast and it has to be bomb!

Well, you can imagine how quickly I entered the realm of morning glory when we found Sugar Shack. The food here is amazing. I love the HSS special. It's a super delicious grilled ham, scrambled egg, and cheddar cheese breakfast sandwich that I like to add a little avocado too. Sooooo good. I still haven't had a chance to try their breakfast burrito, but I totally want to.

The people that work there are laid back and efficient. There's a nice outdoor patio on Main St and another covered patio in the back. Quick service. Great food. What else could you ask for? Oh... would you also like one of the nicest beaches in America?? Well it's really close to the beach, so if you are looking for delicious morning time food before heading there, this is the place!

The Sugar Shack is where it's at!</Text>< Pics>

Great breakfast. Great service.
My favorites are the Kepplers Special, with a poached egg, and the HSS Special, with fried eggs over medium.</Review><Response>None<//Response>< date>

Best breakfast in town and the prices seem too cheap for such a great family place. Don't bring a dog for outdoor seating, though unless it is a legit service dog.</text>

Centrally located breakfast joint in HB. It's usually so busy here that it's hard to get a table. I finally got to eat here last year and wasn't blown away by the food, it was just ok. I'll probably give it another shot at some point.</text>

-Wait time was to be expected it's a popular spot.
-Staff was excellent, seating is tight, not a great place for groups larger than 4 or 5 (7 of us all together, jammed into a 4 person table on the patio). It was really sunny so definitely bring some sunscreen if you're sitting outside.
-Park further up Main Street or on a side street and walk in, parking always bad the closer to PCH you get.
-Food came out pretty fast for a busy restaurant.
Got the eggs Benedict. Everyghing tasted very fresh, ham was exceptional. English muffin wasn't overcooked. What just made it alright was the hollandaise sauce. It was just  bland to my taste buds. I really love a tangy hollandaise sauce. Everyone else seemed to really love their food so next time I go I'll try the a breakfast burrito or omelette I think.
3-stars for just okay food. If you're a big water the eggs Benedict will leave you hungry, only comes with hash browns.<//text>

<text>Pretty boring food for a place with the name "Sugar Shack", most of the stuff on the breakfast menu is eggs, hashbrowns, same stuff you'd find at IHOP. Wanted to try something different, but the Peggi's French Toast was the most blandless thing I've ever eaten. Not sure about the lunch menu, but for breakfast, steer clear.</text>< date>

<Text>I was asked to leave this dive because I had my little 15 lbs dog with me, on a leash and on my lap sitting at a table closest to main st. Maybe if their food was better they could be more discriminating with their customers,  but they don't do anything special, so I see no need to ever return.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

This casual place may be in "Surf City" with alleged hipsters, but this piece of Americana is disappearing so fast, that anyone, sub 30 something, should make this their "diner" destination before death or before the "suits/bean counters" ruin all.<//review>

Really don't understand why this place is so popular. The food is not good at all. We ordered toast and it was just cheapie grocery store bread toasted. Coffee was also low quality.< /Text>
