The Brisket is good. The chicken was to dry. The potato salad tasted like STORE BOUGHT DOCTORED (I DIDN'T LIKE) not worth $8. I like homemade. The sides was good but small for price. The cashier asked how we liked the meal. I told her the salad was not homemade and she said "I made it" WOW SMH it taste store bought. I patronized once that's enough. Again the Brisket was really good.< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I've never dined in at this place but I've Grubhubbed it a couple of times. Every time, man....EVERY TIME...this place hits the spot. Woody's and Philip's are great but this is better, especially because they deliver.

My meals have always arrived within 25 minutes. The meat is like butter, mac n' cheese is delicious, etc. Say you're seeing those long lines at Woody's, and they aren't taking orders over the phone (really?), try The Wood and enjoy.

The sauce ain't lacking and the food is smacking. If ever I need BBQ, I know who to call.</text>< pictures>

Disappointed in all the fat with the brisket, overpriced food with small portions. Sauce was a good taste, but they are seriously OVERPRICED. Our 2 item combos were 23 bucks and all it comes with is little meat portions and microscopic sides.. I think they have potential to be a great place, but they need to up them food portions or lower them prices.. I'm rooting for them to re-strategize and reach their success..</review>

<Text>I ordered via text as instructed. I received a text back asking for my name. I sent my name and added a dessert. I went to the restaurant my original order was ready. She had to prepare the dessert. The food was okay. The meat has too much sauce and the macaroni and cheese doesn't have enough cheese. I sent the owner a text letting him know I never received a text saying my order was ready. He apologized but the text messaging that followed was unnecessary. I was telling him that the menus on the website and in the restaurant aren't the same. He didn't agree and continued unfavorable texting with me. I more than likely won't return to the Wood.< /Text>< pictures>

The only thing good was the sauce. You're over priced. The potatoes salad had large pieces of onions and peppers. The greens were tasteless. I didnt trust the radio reviews but husband went anyway. I think you guys should  fine some more cooks and do better. Also season your meat before cooking it. Don't just count on your sauce.<//Review>

I didn’t expect for it to taste so so sweet!  They don’t offer hot, spicy or medium sauce only SWEET! Ugh who does that??  I asked for hot sauce or hot peppers and they didn’t have that, instead they offered me Sriracha! Really??
I should’ve known better when It didn’t have that bbq smell when I walked inside.  I won’t be eating here again.
They get a grade: C-<//Text>

Gave them a try yesterday. So the brisket was good and it was a nice portion. Me and my daughter were kinda side eyeing the mac and cheese but it was good.  She liked her ribs. I liked the potato salad but it just had too many bell peppers in it for me. Baked beans were ok. I also like that everything was seasoned properly. We'll definitely stop by again and try something else on the menu soon.< /Review>

REAL TALK!!! I've been hearing about this place on the radio so last night I stopped by. I got the brisket and ribs, w/Mac, beans and potato salad and cornbread. I love tender meat. This meat was delicious...tender, seasoned and cooked. The mac,beans are potato salad were excellent. They need to work on that cornbread...too much cornmeal and don't be scared to let the muffins brown a little. I loved the sauce-a perfect blend of what you want BBQ sauce to be with a lil kick that perfectly compliments the tender, perfectly seasoned meat.  A little pricey for take out (nearly$40, w/no drink). However, if this place survives the pandemic it is going to be something special in a little sit down dining spot. Overall the food was magnificent.  I'll definitely be back.<//text>

Deserves Zero stars! Disgusting! This is not BBQ. It tasted like they literally gave us cold chicken and opened up a jar of some kind of BBQ sauce and poured it on top and served it cold! Also burgers were extremely salty and greasy. Never again!< /Text>

<Text>I came here based on the aroma of a discarded rib bone!!! My nephew had a combo plate delivered to the house. I let my grandpup lick the bone on the car ride home you would've thought we had the actual rib with the meat it smelled so good. Anywho I visited today and it was everything I thought it would be. The meat just fell off the bone. The brisket just fell apart just delicious. Will I drive all the way back here?? Yeap<//Text>< pictures>

My best customer experience in a long time. I wish I knew his name, then his mom appeared. The 5 others waiting let her know that her son was wonderful. I will return just because of that young man</text>

<review>This was my FIRST time there. The  atmosphere is nice. The ladies that work there ( on the day I was there) were Beautiful. I really enjoyed the food. I ordered the Rib-Tips. With Mac and cheese 🧀, potato salad 🥗. My only reason for not giving a 5 🌟. Is because I don't eat salt and I could really taste it. I promise, that is totally a ME THING. The Food is good 😊. Will be going back soon.</review>< Pics>

I’ve heard KJLH talk about how great their food is so my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try. The establishment was clean and the lady that took my order was friendly and professional. But the food was horrible, not bad but horrible. I ordered rib tips, brisket sandwich with beans and Mac and cheese. I couldn’t even eat it. Unfortunately it was a waste of money.</Review>

Couldn’t tell the difference between the brisket and bbq chicken bc they looked the same but were not labeled. Tiny sides. Bland macaroni n cheese (hardly any cheese) and the girl flirted with my husband. But at least she didn’t pursue after he said he was married so I guess that matters. Still, unprofessional. I did not base this review on that though. I wouldn’t recommend the food nor would I go back bc of the reasons above.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2b7dfd140dcc7:0x4a1d1ddebb41123<//Gmap_id>< username>

I don't know which size portions you are asking aside from asking for a whole cow.
1. These are the right size portions!  we had 2 different 2 meat combos and everything was delicious.
2.  Tubs for the side look small but the content is the right size, and more I would be overstuffed.
3. This is the most delicious BBQ with in 20 miles of Playa Vista.  We have tried many before and it only got from bad to worse.  But not so THE WOOD.
4. For this quality of food it is the right price.

Thank you, keep up the good work!!!</text>

This is a very clean and spacious restuarant. and for barbecue very expensive I had the Brisket with mac n cheese, and baked beans.the mac was delicious, beans hot and flavorful both taste freshly made the Brisket taste as if it was boiled terrible flavor. I will not be going back< /Review>

<Text>Well I have to be honest I have been to this spot about three times the bbq is tender,they are skimpy on the portions but I still wanted to support my people. However the last time I visited i spent close to $100. And my ribs were over seasoned  with black pepper , street corn was too they dizzle sauce on ribs and brisket. I contracted the person I believe  was the owner and gave him the feed back before I shared it with this plantform, they promised to make good on my order but didn't,  so I don't think I will be going back I work hard for my money and if I  am not value as a customer  wheather  its black owned or not I just don't  spend  my money  where I'm  not appreciated..</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Ordered  through GrubHub, instructions was sauce on the side well you could guess they didn’t do that call the restaurant, so he would call me back so what am I supposed to do with food only. Also ordered $45 worth of food the combo came with two ribs, I don’t know how long this place is going stay in business but this is not how you bill your customer base, Only reason we try to places because they got good reviews on the radio. I will never order there again.<//text>

I ordered the 2 meats with 2 sides the brisket had more fat and sauce ( 1 piece) than meat   the chicken link (1 link) was rubbery the mac n cheese and cold slaw was good just not enough food for the price and the sauce taste store bought won’t be going back....</text>

Food was dry hince the large amount of sauce just poured on it, and they literally give you a tablespoon of a side. Food wasnt worth the wait or the money. I'd love to share my pictures I took of how bad this place is. Worst meal I've ever had and I'm a veteran.</review>

The first time we went the baked beans were burnt, the next time they weren't, the mac&cheese was just ok, the brisket was a little dry both times, the street style corn 🌽 was the best thing that we had, both times we went to they were out of I can't remember what they were promoting<//text>

<Review>I order thru the website and I push pickup
Then after I paid I notice postmate was going to deliver i text to inquire about my situation i get a reply we turned off the
App. So I thought about and ending up driving over there, they didn't have the order.  Disappointed 😞.  The young lady took my order and waited about 40 minute's</Review>< rating>

It's nice to experience a landscape supplier with friendly staff. Rather than fulfilling order as requested,  staff will confirm measurements and product. Driver called before arrival and arrived a little late due to traffic but assisted in opening gate. Recyle mulch looks as pictured on website. Prices are reasonable in comparison to new mulch from other vendor which is twice as much.</review>

<Text>My "go to" place currently. Good prices and selection. Loading and delivery crew is top notch.
Typically, good service. They need a counter for the weekend warriors so they don't slow down contractors or (DIYers) people that know what they need and want to get in and out.<//Text>< pics>

<rating>1<//rating><review>After seeing quite a few employees at Bee Green working around customers inside without masks, it’s clear that this business is not trustworthy.  If they can’t be trusted to keep people safe from the virus… a matter of life and death… then how can we trust them to be honest in their business dealings?  I tried to contact Bee Green about the Covid problem and received no response at all.<//review>< Pics>

Bee Green Recycling and Supply is a great resource. We were able to order from their online catalog and picked up our purchases - we saved time because we knew what we wanted, and we knew they had it. The people who helped us were very nice, both the cashier and the person who bagged our compost and bark out in the yard. It was a busy Saturday, and everyone we encountered was following this pandemic's protocols for social distancing and masks. Last but not least, the value was excellent. Check them out.</review>

Good spot to get rid of your s***. A few tips:

The location given here (725 Independent) is for the C&D Yard, where you'll probably bring most of your stuff. But if you're bringing concrete, bricks, rock, dirt, shingles, or green waste, go to the second location a few blocks north on Coliseum, the Inert and Green Waste Yard (5900 Coliseum).

I sat in line for 30mins on a Saturday at the C&D Yard and when I pulled up they sent me to the other location because I was dumping concrete. I brought a load of bricks later. The good part: the rates are cheaper and there was no line.

I paid ~$110 today to dump two loads of concrete and brick, about 2600 pounds.

Map and rates in photos.</Text>

This location at Bee Green has the best rates in town. The line is never extreme, the service seems fast. Every ocasión I have need to use this dump yard I am never there more that 30 minutes.

I can’t say enough great things about Beegreen. They’re the most helpful in the business I have ever dealt with. I am not a professional landscaper, but I am what you might call a professional DIY’r. I shopped with suppliers all around the Bay Area to feel them out. Nobody at Clark’s wouldn’t even acknowledge I was there, Lyngso didn’t seem that interested in answering questions and those I asked were met with a bit of a condescending attitude. On the other hand Beegreen is great with their customer service. I emailed questions about my patio project and was promptly answered by Nick Smith. He would answer all the emails I sent him and advise so as a DIY warrior I could achieve professional results. Everyone at the yard is so kind and helpful. I simply put my order in online and selected “I will pick up at the yard”. The customer service reps were kind and even the loader operator who dumped my orders into my truck confirmed my order and always said “great, have a nice day!”. In a time we’re customer service has really taken a dive it’s good to see a company that still cares about it’s customers and gives great service, treating small DIY orders with equal importance to professionals with large orders. Keep it up Beegreen, you’re killing it!!!!</Text>

Great for big landscaping and yard work jobs. Stick to home depot if you only need 1 or 2 bags of soil or gravel. This place is great if you want to feel the bed of your truck with bark or sand or rock.< /text>

I am a landscape designer. This is my first time using Bee Green and we decided to use them for our own home project prior to using on client jobs. I needed 4 yards of base rock and from the ordering over the phone to my having to shift the delivery a week since our crews were delayed, to day of delivery, everything was 5 stars. Then Sergio the delivery guy was amazing with the fork lift and was able to get the sacks to a spot that made everything easier for us later in offloading the gravel. I like that I can also return the supersacks for my deposit so they can be reused and not end up in the trash. Bee Green has tons of landscape materials and I will recommend to all the contractors I work with.< /review>

There's never any waiting time to get service at the store, pick ups are easy and uncomplicated,  and  deliveries of mulch, firewood, etc. are prompt and punctual. And the long-sleeved bee keeping gloves make excellent and affordable rose pruning gloves.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

First of all,its a small place,and the wait time is very long when it gets busy.it took me long time to get into the dump site.when you start dupming your stuff,they want you to sort your dump like metal goes into one place,wood in one place,and if you have tile or concrete,they want you to move your truck to a different dump location.i had to wait for them to clear the site for the concrete and move my truck.its so waste of time,i paid to dump not helping them to sort out the garbage,thats their job.and at the end,the bill is high too,i got a full pickup truck load for $90+,never paid so high before.in conclusion,if you have a lot of time to waste,and if your don't mind paying more money,this is the place to go.</review>

When I call it says "the number you have called is not in service".  On their website it says "Your connection is not private. Attackers might be trying to steal your information from mobilecomputerwizard.com".  I hope this business is alright and did not go under with this quarantine.  They were great.</review>

<Review>I own a small business and Mobile Computer Wizard has helped me out of several technological jams! They can always fit me in and are super helpful when they arrive. Most recently, Gregg hooked me up with an amazing new camera system. He was efficient and addressed all my questions.< /Review>< pics>

Very knowledgeable and honest. I was quoted how much it would cost to fix my laptop and advised it would be more cost effective to buy a new one instead of paying the cost of the repair. I appreciated the feedback and decided to take his advice.<//Text>

<Review>I can't say enough good things about Mobile Computer Wizard.  Very responsive, can do attitude, very knowledgeable, and very fair with what they charge.  I have used them for years.  If you searching for IT/computer help, give Mobile Computer Wizard a try.  They are super.</Review>< pictures>

< Review>
I've used Mobile Computer Wizard many times and have always received excellent service. Even though, this last time, my hard drive had crashed, Brett quickly got a new drive in and set up a restore from the cloud. I was back in business the same day. I have used the company for years because of the great support.<//Review>

They picked up my desktop the same day and had it on the bench that afternoon.  Gave me a fair quote on repairing what I THOUGHT was the problem.  After conducting their own diagnosis they advised me that what I thought was the problem was in fact not the real issue. They advised me they'd button it up and return it to me no charge if the actual repairs were more than the value of my PC.  I ended up asking them to custom bench build a new machine.  They did so for about 1/2 what it would have cost from a major global computer company.  They delivered my new machine and set it up in record time.  I give them my strongest unconditional highest recommendation for ethical business practices, top level professional interpersonal skills and timelyness.<//review>< rate>

I have been using Mobile Computer Wizard for the past 10+ years.  The customer Service is outstanding.  I always call frantic needing help ASAP and they find away to accommodate me.  Their rates are fair and the get the job done right the first time!!  I trust them to work on my computer. I love that they can remote in and show me the issue and then get it fixed.  I highly recommend Mobile Computer Wizard.< /Text>

After a miserable and useless experience with a dying desktop at San Diego Computer Repair on Clairemont Mesa Blvd, Greg, Randy and the team at Mobile Computer Wizard were a total blessing!  Professional and very personable, they did all they could to save me money while providing the fixes I so desperately needed.  Recommend them very highly!  Kat O.< /review>

<Review>My first experience with Mobile Computer Wizard was a few years ago when our server crashed.  Kyle was out to our office that very day, he diligently worked going through the methods of recovery but our drive was damage beyond repair, so he suggested we use a data recovery service. We were unsure of the state of our hard drive, and reluctant to sending it out, as all of our company history and 8 years with of data accounts were on that drive (our back up was not running properly and we had no back up data either).  This was a critical and stressful for us as we were dead in the water.  Kyle was honest; he let us know the possible outcomes of not being able to recover everything if anything.  I respected his expertise and trusted him and his advice.  Thankfully, we eventually we got back up in running with new drive and all our data recovered!  Kyle was patient, knowledgeable and now we wouldn’t trust anyone but Mobile Computer Wizards for all our networking and computer needs.  We have been using them since for all hardware upgrades and software recommendations.  Kyle even helped set our back up properly now so a disaster like that will never happen again.  I cannot thank Kyle enough for all he has helped us with.  Kyle goes above and beyond the call of duty; he is incredibly friendly, intelligent, and reliable. He has wonderful service skills and is an outstanding representation of this great company.  He is willing to help not just make things run, but to make things run more sufficient.  My infinite gratitude to all the wonderful Wizards of Mobile Computer!< /Review>< Date>

<Text>As the owner of a small business, I rely on other small businesses and services to help me stay successful and function.  Since opening in 2008, I can count on one hand (with fingers left over) those who I truly trust.  Mobile Computer Wizards is definitely one of those businesses that I could not live without.  They have been invaluable to me both personally (with my personal laptop) and professionally (with all of our networked computers in my business).  Kyle (specifically) has made my life so much easier by finding solutions to all of my PC problems.  He has spent numerous hours working on my computers and is always there for me by phone or email should I have a question—or if something is just not working like I think it should.  He is professional, knowledgeable, personable, easy- to-understand, NOT intimidating or condescending, and a delight to work with.  I am happy to refer him and MCW to anyone and everyone who will listen.  I know the power of a good referral.  This is a wonderful group of professionals that you can trust and who will do an excellent job with anything computer-related.  I am very happy to have them in my life.<//Text>< Pictures>

When you are in real trouble, GET GREG! I had my business and personal domains hacked. I am talking Russian email in my Outlook and Chinese pages on my websites. Greg got me secured and back in business before the next day. None of my credit or financial accounts were breached due to the expert service I received. The Mobile Computer Wizard team are the best you can get. It is worth every penny to let them manage everything for you.

If it weren't for Mobile Computer Wizard, I would have bought a new computer when I didn't need to!  That alone saved me over a grand!  They are reliable, price is reasonable and customer service is outstanding.  I highly recommend using this company.  Support our local businesses.  It's well worth it.</text>

Did I mention he had the flu? Because yeah, that's how dedicated Randy is to his customers.

Mobile Computer Wizard Inc. has to be the most professional company in San Diego. Their staff member, Doug, is prompt and personable and most importantly he patiently answers all questions and dispenses with problems very quickly.

Whenever anything goes awry with my computers, Kyle of Mobile Computer Wizard  is my go-to guy. Extremely knowledgeable, absolutely professional and always a pleasure to do business with. He bailed me out when my previous computer died, quickly setting me up with a locally built computer that met my rather specific needs and that blows the mass-produced ones out of the water. He's equally adept with Macs and PCs and is an excellent troubleshooter, refusing to give up until an issue is resolved and always trying the least expensive solution first. I've recommended him many times to friends and am pleased to recommend him here as well. I couldn't be happier with his service.</text>

I was the victim of a phishing scam and the experience nearly destroyed my entire PC. I was in a panic and found great reviews on this company so i took a chance and I'm amazed at the work done to restore my computer. They not only found a way to restore all my pictures and documents but was able to restore windows 10 and now my computers good as new. Highly recommend! Thank you guys for the amazing work</review>

Responsive with scheduling, reliable with appointment times, Kyle, for one, has been a great listener and explainer, and has proven nimble with delivering success with set-ups, troubleshooting, and with solving some complicated problems.

I had a dead computer and they did everything they could to resuscitate it, then applied their diagnostic charge to the information download.  I really appreciated their positive attitudes and economical pricing.  I will return if I ever have computer problems again.< /review>

My home computer had been losing power and I knew it was old and in need of replacement.  Kyle came in and switched it over to a computer I had formerly used at my office.  Before, I was not fully capable of communicating well with my office, but now I can work from home if needed and this computer can allow me do this now.  Kyle is efficient and pleasant to deal with.  He has always been the key computer guy for any problem we have in the office as well as at my home.  If you need any help with your computer system, you can be confident in Kyle's abilities.< /text>

<name>Scott Davis<//name><Text>I first contacted Mobile Computer Wizard several years ago to convert my files to my new computer. I chose them because of a discount offer they had for first time customers. As the saying goes....people come for the price but stay for the service.

I've used Mobile Computer Wizard probably 6 times since. Always very professional, always mindful of my budget and each and every time completed the tasks requested (and often more) to my complete satisfaction. I appreciate that for more simplistic issues, they can do the work remotely....and for more complex concerns, come right to your door, ON TIME.

I recommend Mobile computer Wizard to any small business that does not have an IT savvy employee on the team (who has the time to work in this capacity), or to any individual that needs help.

<review>Mobile Computer Wizard and all of the personnel working there have been nothing short of amazing since the moment we began using their services in early 2013.

We operate a small law firm here in San Diego. More often then not we need someone with high technical capabilities to keep our office functional. Each time we have a security breach, virus, system  malfunction, need set up and install on software/printers/scanners, etc. MCW comes to our rescue quickly and efficiently.

We have experienced nothing but professionalism and service with a smile and would never think of using anyone else given the amount of time and effort MCW has put forth to make sure we are happy with their services. I highly recommend MCW for all computer needs.< /review>< Rating>

Most excellent service by a pigtailed waitress who chatted us up while serving us some pretty tasty micro-brews.

We didn't have any food this trip, but have had it in the past and wasn't disappointed.

Good job by this local Round Table!</text>

Continue to be disappointed here. Moved across the street a year ago and ordered a lot. Lately I keep telling myself I'm not coming here anymore.  Tired of spending lots of money to be disappointed.  Today's order was delivery.  Pizza was 25 minutes late and arrived cold.  Sauces  I wanted were not included. And the website would not accept my 15% off coupon.  Coupon from there website.  I spent $55 and I'm disappointed.😣<//review>

<Date>1466270414095</Date><rating>4<//rating><Text>The remodel is pretty good- I like the modern decor and the huge TVs for sports watching; we feel like we have  viable place to eat out on a Friday night on the ridge with the family instead of having to go to always go to Chico.  The burgers and new sides are actually really good, and their pizza has always been good.  I agree with some of the other reviewers with my complaints -- the prices are getting pretty crazy ($30+ for a large pizza?  Really?) and that the restaurant does feel cramped - I don't think it is quite big enough to pull off the "clubhouse" model as well as some other Round tables.  Prior to the remodel, RT felt really spacious inside, but now it feels claustrophobic.  Still, it's great to have something a little more current in town.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Always great pizza, busy hopping place on a Friday night! Good salad bar. Not much beer variety if you're not in to IPAs!!</Text>

Wanted to try this place for the first time. It was impossible to order anything. I called and asked for a delivery to magalia, he said they dont deliver here.  Ok fine right? Then i called back and asked if i could pay over the phone and come and pick it up, that way i could send my roommate there on his way home from work. The dumb teenager on the phone told me that i cant pay over the phone for a pickup order, and that over the phone payment is only for delivery orders. I even asked if he could ring it up as a delivery, and i would pay the delivery charge but pick it up instead, still NO. What kind of place are you running...? you seriously wont let a customer pay UP FRONT? Especially a first time customer. Youd rather people place an order for pickup and pray that they acutally show up to pay for it? Thats the stupidest thing ive ever heard of. I will definately never order from this place. Its a small town around here,  and not many places are open as late as you. You just lost alot of business.< /review>

<Review>Ordered online for delivery.  Waited over 45 minutes for a cold pizza.  Live 10 mins from restaurant. No delivery sleeve  for the pie, and $2.50 for a 20 oz Pepsi?Living in paradise, no delivery pizza should be cold. C'mon RTP... I had higher hopes.< /Review><time>1509835066600< /time><gmap_id>0x809cd4985c2a83d3:0x65d27ae6d2f355bf<//gmap_id>< Pics>

<review>Well- I'll start out saying the environment was awesome! Nice bar huge tvs and great place for kids to play. We ordered a salad a wombo combo and a pitcher of beer. Salad and beer just great...however sadly pizza was not good at all. The crust was under done and wet. We will stick with our local pizza spot here in Magalia.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Im pregnate and at home with no vehicle. Roundtable waited until the delivery driver was leaving the store to call to tell me that they dont accept $100.00 bills. I wish this was mentioned on their website or that someone wouldve called sooner. You dont know hunger until your pregnant, without a vehicle and have  waited for an hour for food thats allready on its way. I will order from somewhere else will accept my american dollars.< /Review>

I have mixed feelings about this place.  The remodel attempted to make it "Applebees meets Chuck E Cheese", but the restaurant is simply not big enough to make it really work as it just feels cramped.  The arcade room is a nice idea, but is too small to be more than a one time novelty for the kids....and they ended up losing the back room (you can no longer reserve a space for birthday parties unless you have 20 people!).  The food is pricey for what you get, the wait times are horrendous on Friday and Saturday nights, and the mostly teenage staff is apathetic and generally useless (the remodel didn't help at all with that!)

Having said all of that, the pizza is still good and it is nice to watch a game at the bar.  It's also nice to have a restaurant in Paradise that does not have that God-awful 1950s theme.  The microbrew selection is pretty good, too.  Overall, it's an OK place to go every once in awhile, but I certainly wouldn't put it in the regular eating-out rotation list.<//text>

<Text>Wow... I just called to make a pizza order had full bars on my phone and still she says can't hear you. Then, I asked about if you can switch toppings to make it the same price she says yes then I ask her how much it is and she says 19.. I asked why so much she says no way to swap topping for another you have to pay.  Other companies do it why not them... lost bussness from me and I'll share it with the world.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>My roommate and I moved in to 1181 E. Baywood September. We still don't have a screen for one of our living room windows. Our dishwasher has been leaking since we've moved in and it is still leaking to this day. Our water has been off since yesterday morning Nov28 and it is still off, with no warning or notice. My roommate has called emergency maintenance twice and me once. Our neighbors have called as well and still nothing! Our gate has been stuck open for over a week as well! We haven't even lived here long and I'm worried for the rest of our stay. It's so annoying and frustrating that nothing is being done. Maintenance request mean nothing at all to this complex. Emergency maintenance means nothing as well apparently. Had high hopes moving in here and now very very disappointed.< /review>< Date>

Have been living here for years never had a problem till Hensley took over. They never really answered the phone,  since before covid.  My laundry washer has not been fixed for over a month now.  This is essential! They don't even let me know when they will come fix it.  Don't like how we have to sign our lease online.  They used to provide everything in paper.  I never check my email or forget my password. Just print out everything in paper. I always like to have a physical copy.  The gym is small.  Supposedly they renewed it. I thought they were gonna make it bigger.  Only like 5 tenants can be comfortably there.  Also the gate always breaks and is open all the time so anyone can drive in.  I had my car stolen from here.  I like the set up though and my area is generally quiet that's why I haven't moved.< /review>

Butch, the supervisor of maintenance, an unbelievably awesome guy. He totally restored my faith in the Hensley at Corona Pointe Apartments. Very professional and a great personality. Hensley at Corona Pointe is very lucky to have such an employee that takes pride in his work. Thanks a lot Butch!< /review>

Stated in their lease contract it's suppose to be "smoke free". Various of times we come home or even when we are home our place smells like a cheap motel. We have called management, emailed and nothing has really been taking care of. It has now been months and problem continues. So disappointed with Hensley.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Can never get a hold of leasing office. When able to get a hold they are very unprofessional. Maintenance has entered my apartment without my permission, stated twice on a work order that they had no permission to enter and they did. Placed two emergency work orders when i was getting locked in and out of my apartment due to an issue with the front door both days no one came, called the on site leasing office on day three and was told that the person i spoke with at the emergency line BOTH DAYS who’s name was Sebastian neglected to mark my call as an emergency! No communication with leasing office regarding moving out process they do not respond to emails sent 5-6 times before getting a response if any response<//text>

Worst place to stay, Management is full of Lazy ladies... Never answer the phone, No maintenance to assist you in need...Parking issue is there.... DO NOT RISK yourself to come and stay in here.... They LIE to you about the facilities while showing the apartments. This place is a HOT SPOT for WEED SMOKERS...

PLS PLS PLS DO NOT MOVE to this HELL.....</Text>

Our washer hasn't been working and they haven't fixed it in pretty much 2 months already. They keep saying someone will come fix it and we made an appointment, and they keep saying the next day and the next day cause they're short staffed supposedly. They need to hire more maintenance guys. They rarely answer the phone. They don't care about nothing about the residents just the rent money.</Text>

We understand that this is an inconvenience so we are giving a sufficient 60 days plus for residents search for their new home. As for car break ins, we do have courtesy patrol on property from 7pm to 5am. They work diligently on keeping our property safe , however we cannot fight crime. We were unaware of your pest concerns as we do not have any record of you scheduling any treatments. Pest control is on property every Tuesday and Friday , this service is free to you . If you would like to schedule an appointment you may do so in the leasing office,  Again we apologize for any inconvenience , Hensley Management'}<//response><Review>Response: They charge a monthly bug fee! It’s not free and when I requested it in previous years it didn’t do much so I’ve been incurring the expense of liquid traps that help.

Been here almost 5 years and they are refusing to renew my lease so they can upgrade my apartment like the others apartments and make a fortune more! It’s in the paperwork sent to me! I am a single mom struggling and in school full time and given less than 2 months to find a place and a deposit and move out! I’m disgusted with this place. We are good tenants who always pay our rent on time! They didn’t even offer us to move to another apt. Lots of car break ins, windows shattered, and bugs. It’s typical apartment living but the prices are already high but they are redoing everything to raise it even higher. They have no loyalty to their residents. We may end up homeless because I don’t have the means to move and wasn’t  even offered a one bedroom instead of two or any other option but told they need my apartment to upgrade and I have the paper they stuck on my door.

<resp>None< /resp><username>Eric Radtke</username><Text>I will never live here again, the worst apartments I’ve ever had to deal with. My lease was coming to an end and I knew that so I was looking at new apartments.The leasing office never informed me or my roommate about the procedures for moving out. They only sent us letters to renew our lease nothing other than that. So it felt like if you weren’t renewing you’re on your own and they didn’t care. I went into the office September 3rd To talk to one of the management staff about what do I do for moving out. The staff said “come on the day you were finished moving out and we will check you out of your apartment and and your utilities.” I said “OK thank you and I will be back on the day that we are officially moved out to turn in all my stuff.”So I went on the 29th to finish checking out of the month and I already moved earlier in the month and they said everything was fine and you’ll receive a notice of your statement in the email. So I get the statement and they say because I didn’t turn in a written notice because I asked on September 3 and not 30 days out that I am not liable to pay one months worth of rent the for the following month as a fee which came out to $1955 that more then the previous rent I had. Also the original bill without the fee is only $100. They took my whole deposit and are demanding more or it will go to collections.  Such a terrible company. I warn you NEVER MOVE HERE SCHOOLS AND AREA SUCKS FOR TRAFFIC AND MANAGEMENT DOSNT CARE ABOUT YOU. I ALSO GOT SCAMMED IN THE BEGINNING BY THEM ALSO FOR CHARGING ME EXTRA ON MY APPLICATION FEES. CHARGED ME 4 times and never got my refund. Came out to couple hundreds lost.</Text></record>

The Hensley team has been extremely helpful through out the whole decision on the apartment and getting everything done that was needed. Day of move in took no more than 30 mins and we were moved in by the end of day<//review>

<pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><text>When I first got here, the grounds were well kept up. Now the grounds look like hell. The Gardner only seems to come once a month- there are leaves and sharp tree seeds covering everything and the grass has yellowed. There’s a gross spill like food on the walkway that has been there for two months. I asked four times that the hole in the “dog park” (there’s NEVER any dogs in there) fence be fixed and it hasn’t- which is dangerous and let’s dogs escape- mine did. Security patrol guys are creepy and unfriendly. The rent is too high and got raised for new applicants. There are loud people in the parking lots a lot. The only good feature about living here is the location- close to everything I need. But I’m moving when my lease is up.
Oh yeah, there’s also cockroaches and bad attitudes from staff. I’ve had a few run-ins with them too.< /text><Time>1533191967624<//Time><GmapID>0x80dcb80ecd35110f:0xae088fe57c6b2c9e< /GmapID><user>110260037214498759801< /user><Rate>2< /Rate><user_name>Tara Lookadoo<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

Moved in july2010 never had an issue until the NEW MANAGEMENT.(Hensley). The unit that we got was upgraded and supposably every appliance was new... The FIRST NIGHT was when it started the little roaches came out to greet us.. Honestly that was the worst!! Called the office and they were SURPRISED there was pests... And just sent pest control like 4 times which we had to pay. Every day I would get home there was never parking mind you it was barely 6pm?. They charge you monthly for the carports and garage. They charge you for everything. Glad we are out The staff has very poor Communication skills with each other. The only person you can go to and will do something is Laura. Other than that.

Vehicles break ins were an issue but seems like the new management have taken care of it.
The complex looks much better after redoing parking spaces and other improvements.
The new management have also added Amazon hub which is also very convenient.

I was expecting one of those two persons to take the other interested people while the other available person could show my mom & me around. Instead, the employees took us together. I didn’t mind it until my mom and i were left in the back and had figure out the amenities through the website since the two employees were too busy helping/flirting with the other person that just tagged along in OUR tour. One of the employees kept on saying “ay ay ay” and making Spanish slurs/jokes as if my mom and I spoke Spanish. My mom is Lebanese and I am half Brazilian. I don't understand Spanish so the fact that she assumed we did, really offended us. I tried my best to see things on the bright side, but being ignored and disrespected after I had already requested a tour via email was so humiliating that i just left. I didn’t request for any more information & they didn’t ask me to take a seat since clearly, the other person who just tagged along was their favorite. I expected to be given the time, energy & respect for that tour, since I live over an hour away. I expected a bit of professionalism but instead I got the opposite. So if you’re working in a leasing office, don’t assume people’s race just by the color they dyed their hair, it’s rude & completely ignorant.< /text><user_id>111764505596946098838<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

Do not move here. Both of my cars got broken into and got everything stolen from. Leasing office did not seem to care and just asked if I filled a police report and called my renters insurance. Yes this can happen anywhere, but from when my cars got broken into the gates were being left open 24/7. They closed them for a week after my stuff got stolen and again they've been open for the past 2-3 weeks. (-: To make things worse they gave me a garage for $100 and the first day I try and open it to go to work at 7:00 AM, the garage is not working. I had to wait until 3 PM to get it open. Two days later I park my car inside and tried to close it, but nope it did not want to close. Yesterday I get a note for the first time ever after 4 months to put my parking pass on my car and yes this was my mistake that I never put it on my glass, but I tried to ask for a new one literally 10 minutes ago and they said it is $50 to replace it or my car will get towed.(Which I do not remeber them saying it was $50 to replace nor did I see it on the contract that I just reread right now). Btw I can not even keep my working truck here because they stole everything from there so now I have to drive an extra 30 minutes away and 30 minutes back just to keep my truck safe. These apartments are a joke. So please just move somewhere else and not here, and listen to the reviews because they are true. (-:

LOL update: They closed the gates a few days after this review or because a motorcycle got stolen in these apartment .

Update: This is four months later and my car got broken into and it was hit from the driver rear side. I am also surprised management did not comment anything here? Maybe because they know they suck? I'd recommended maybe better security. 😃< /Review>

Do not live in these apartments. I had a horrible experience and the managers could care less. They recently painted the surrounding apartment and my daughter and I had to sleep with the horrible smell all night. They gave no notices of the turpentine use and didn’t show any compassion. The smell caused red eyes and migraines. I called to discuss. They said all they could do was open the windows and put an air freshener in the vent. The smell was extremely strong and unsafe. They did not care. They refused to discount one night. I spoke with the manager Rochelle and she said there was nothing she could do about it. She was extremely unpleasant and I would not recommend to live in a place where the managers didn’t care about their residents health.</Text>

This is a review from a tenant, Sylvia. Today, May 10, 2019, three cars were stolen from the Hensley Apartment. My brand new Michelin tires that I bought on May 8, 2019 were also stolen from my car and the wheels badly damaged, I reported to the police but they could not do anything because there are no cameras but most importantly the " security patrol" were not aware of the theft.

I went to the leasing office and asked for the number to the Corporate Office , they  refused to give it to me. I was told the Manager will call me, but I am yet to receive the call.  I have lived in this apartment for about 5 years and experienced both Waterstone and Hensley. I am not looking for any excuse or blame game, all I want to see is an improvement in the Sexurity protocols. I also want the number for your Corporate Office.

TENANTS NEED SECURITY MUCH MOTE THAN PAINTED BUILDINGS. THE HOME IMPROVEMENT SHOULD INCLUDE SECURITY.<//Text>

<text>I believe the problem with the loud noises, screaming, shouting, partying, and rude neighbors are the college students that attends The Young Americans College of the Performing Arts that lives in most of the apartments here. Because most of us or all needs peace and quiet in this neighborhood especially at night. It's a huge bother to go their school or call them or talk to those students. I do not want to hear them arguing with one of my neighbors telling them a lie that they were not being loud at all. If you want people to stay in this apartment, then please ask the staffs in the school to discipline their students so there would not be a problem.</text>< pictures>

The apartment community was excellent before it was taken over by the new management company.  The new management company is not willing to listen to the residents and taking privacy.<//Review>

< Review>
I have not been satified and I've stood quiet for a long time this place towed my car a few months ago saying it was because it was a stored vehicle which it wasn't! When I called the office the woman who anwsered the phone was rude and hostile and when I asked to speak to someone higher she said she would transfer my call and instead hung up.. This had me go in and ask to speak to a manager in person I was then told the woman had provides the wrong information and it was because my tags were expired and if I didnt take my car off the premises it will be towed or I could pay an additional 50$ on top of the rent i'm already paying mind theirs never any parking as it is already. on March 18 I put in a service request bc all my outlets in my kichen go out ALL THE TIME since I first moved in I havent been able to cook for my family because of it and I have a one year old to feed I'm writing this review now because checking the status of my matience request they claim to have completed it today on March 19th no one has fixed it so its being ignored. I'm unhappy with my stay here its always something and its always so loud from early in the morning with no consideration of people who work late nights.<//Review>

<Review>Impossible to keep your car clean, every week your car will fill up with dust and dirt from top to bottom because  of the workers and their noisy air blowers. And I lived here for almost 3 years they never bother to fix outside barbecue grills and its impossible to  complain  to anyone here no one will listen to you, but they  will tell you what to do whenever  they want you to do what ever they want you to do. Hate this place.<//Review>< pictures>

TERRIBLE PLACE TO LIVE
I had to deal with cockroaches, ants, rats and the air conditioning never worked properly on 07/10/2018 my newborn daughter almost pastout because it was a hot day and the air conditioning finally gave out, early morning i called the office to report the problem and they didn't show up until around 2 pm even when they knew  it was an EMERGENCY matter

They didn't even bring a portable unit until i had to call again and the workers at the office where VERY rude Nicole the bookkeeper. By this time was already so hot i had to spend the night at a hotel.
All these inconveniences cots me money

Do not move to (Hensley appartment)  their rent is ridiculously high for the quality of living you will get.<//review>

<Review>I seriously hate my upstairs neighbors but that shouldn't be a reflection on the apartment complex itself. It's awesome to hear all the kids playing and see all the high schoolers going to get their education on. Besides the people upstairs everybody that I've met so far has been really nice. Not everybody everywhere and not every apartment you ever live in is going to be perfect or without things happening. It's called life, and the ladies in the office... from what I can tell... are doing their best to keep everybody happy and  in good  quality of life. The dog runs are great plus there's a bunch of Pools and jacuzzis. Sometimes I think people want to live in a brand new luxury monastery.

I had a meeting with the apartment staff this morning and the girls were absolute dolls and very sweet to me about the issues I'm having with my neighbors. They're very festive for Halloween, dressing up and decorating the office, which I think shows the fun and family culture that this company perpetuates. And the girls look super cute too!

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Customer service in the office is horrible. I called in about our deposit which we got less than half back because of a few nail holes in the wall. I am not as angry about the money as I am with the way that I was treated. I first spoke with Cynthia who put me on a hold while I was talking to her without asking in mid sentence. Then I spoke with Lisa who was absolutely disrespectful with a tone that I did not appreciate. I don't care if I was upset. In customer service the customer is ALWAYS right and it is your job as the ladies in the office to cooperate with the customer and make them happy. Not only were they rude but gave out wrong information multiple times. I would not recommend living here as you have to deal with the disrespectful and unprofessional ladies in the office. There is not one time that I walked into the office while living there and felt welcomed.</Text><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80dcb80ecd35110f:0xae088fe57c6b2c9e< /gmapID>< user>

Lived here for 15 months. What I can say about this community that it's an okay place to live maybe for your first place ever. But people are loud, I live near the pool people tend to love to go in after hours and start screaming. Doesn't seem as much as a problem as it used to but it really pissed me off. The gate to get in always had a problem you could sit there with your clicker for minutes trying to get in. People with no parking passes take up parking when they technically are suppose to have a pass of some sort. If you're not home early enough to park your car you're screwed. Most places give you a space but you pay extra here. I gave it a 3 because it's a good location and convenient. Scenery is nice as well.<//review>

If you’re looking for a good place to live and raise kids, keep on looking!! This place is the opposite of what you’re looking for. I moved in January of 2018 and regret even stepping foot on property. Before signing lease, they showed me a unit that was updated and looked really nice and was told my unit would be the same. I paid my deposit to move in 4 weeks later. Between the 4 weeks I have turned in all paperwork needed in order to move in, including my ESA (Emotional Support Animal) paperwork. It was 2 weeks before move in and I messaged and called in to make sure I was all good for move in day. I left messages and emails and no one ever got back to me. I was about to look for another place till finally 1 day before move in someone answers my call and tells me everything is good. On move in day, none of my paperwork was ready and the unit wasn’t even ready. And they charged me an additional $450 to move in with out explaining what for. It took 2 hours to get the paperwork ready and even then, the paperwork was all messed up. When I got to my unit, the place was disgusting. There were cobwebs all across the ceiling, layers and layers of dust, the place smelt like an ashtray and it looked absolutely nothing like the unit I was shown. To add on top of that, I was given a mail key that opened other peoples mailboxes and didn’t receive mine till 3 months later and trying to contact the office in those three months and never receiving a phone call back or even returned emails. Finally after almost 4 months of trying to get ahold of the office, someone returns my call. After explaining my stressful and horrific experience since being a resident, all they could say is “We have new management and there’s nothing we can do about it.” They received a new management when we first moved in, I would think after 4 months things should be running smoothly but no, they just blammed it on new management. I decided to take a look at my lease to see if there is anything I can do, and come to find out the lease they have on my file is no where near the lease I signed on move in. On the lease they have on my file, they charged me an extra $450 for my ESA, which is illegal and charged me per month. So I decided to contact the property management, even they don’t return calls nor answer emails. After about my fifth time trying to contact property management, they call me back. She understood my frustration and set me up a meeting with the management at the apartment. In that meeting she listened and agreed that I was put through the worst since I moved in and decided to let me go out of my lease with no punishment. At that moment I was happy and was willing to just let everything go and walk away from it. Come to find out they are actually charging me for my early leave from the unit and on top of that trying to sue me. Imagine my stress and anxiety while living somewhere you are suppose to feel like home. I have an ESA for a reason and since making the mistake of moving here, it’s been a nightmare. Please save your money and your well being and look for another place to live.< /Review>

<Text>My 15 month Waterstone lease contained a “Lease Contract Buyout Agreement.”  On June 15th, 2016 I provided legal, written notice that I would be vacating the premises with the full understanding that I’d be exercising my early buyout and paying the 1-month rent penalty fee.

When the new community sent a letter of reference to Waterstone, Waterstone did the unthinkable:  they smeared my name and effectively said that I was “not keeping the terms of the agreement.”  The new community denied my application!!!

I personally approached the Waterstone community manager, who stated that she gave me a negative reference because I was “leaving early.”

My mouth was speechless for about 30 seconds, my mind was $#%@$ for about 30 minutes.  Huh!?

I reached out to the Regional Manager in Dallas, TX, whom I shall refer to as “the good ole boys club.”  They offered me dog poop as compensation.

Good ole boys club (GOBC):  “Sami, we’re sorry for the mistake.  I have talked to - and this won’t happen again.  Please let us know what we can do to make up for the error.”

Me: Can you cancel the ‘notice to vacate,’ since I don’t have a place to move into?”

GOBC:  No, the apartment is rented

Me:  Already?  Okay, can give me a 2 bed, 2 bath for the same price as the community I would have moved into had you not committed your “error?”

GOBC: No, we will not match anyone’s rent

Me: “Can you waive the early buyout fee since you smeared my name and effectively violated the Fair Credit Act by stating I was breaking a financial contract?”

GOBC: No, you must still pay the fee

Me:  I don’t understand.  What CAN you do?

GOBC:  “We’ll waive the $200 transfer fee to get one of our really nice, 2 bed, 2 bath apartments.  But you better get it quick, because they’re going’ like hotcakes!

Me:  how is that supposed to make up for the other community’s unit where I would have paid $500 less had you not violated your own lease agreement?

GOBC:  We don’t know, but do you want our unit or not?

Me:  You’re effectively forcing me to stay.  You say I can “buyout,” yet you illegally prevent me from being approved elsewhere?!?  I don’t understand.

GOBC:  We’re sorry for the inconvenience, and we thank you for choosing Westdale.  Would you like the unit or not?

All of my email and communications were polite and professional, yet admittedly became increasingly assertive as the deadline approached.  They ignored email after email, phone call after phone call; until just 5 days before my scheduled vacate date…

They sic their corporate attorney on me who ordered me to cease my communications.  After hearing my story, the attorney went from super-rude to notably polite and in some instances she was left speechless as I explained the facts.  She became so empathetic, that she actually made an attempt to get Waterstone to work with me so that I could stay.  They refused.

I could not afford anything else; the exceptional unit I found in Corona was $500 less than anything else in the city.  I would rather have stayed with my 1 bedroom!

As a result of Westdale’s lease violation,

-I had to move back in with family
-Due to limited community parking where my family lives, I had to return my vehicle lease early and pay penalties, or risk an impound
-Without a vehicle, I lost a job opportunity on account of moving out of Corona.
-My baby was born in the middle of all this

Yes, I know - ‘cry me a river’ - but THIS IS THE TRUTH.  THIS ALL HAPPENED.

In summary:  these people are agents of Satan…they own 1000 sheep but they take the only sheep you own…they build barns to store up riches for themselves…they control billions in market capitalization (literally), but they don’t want to waive a $1,063.00 penalty on account of their own error.<//Text>< pictures>

The staff is lazy,  the accountant who processes the rent payments is CONSTANTLY messing up. We've been charged late fees for rent when we have NEVER been late on paying. Maintenance enters your unit even when you have told them not to. Things have been stolen out of my unit, and mine and my husband's cars have both been broken into and vandalized.  We have also had issues with our upstairs neighbors for 2 years and management and security refuse to do anything about it.

Unfortunately, we cannot speak specifically to promises made to you by the previous management company or experiences you had with that team.  However, when we acquired the property, you also made us aware of the concerns you had with the previous company and our team was more than happy to inspect the apartment home and make any necessary repairs.  We take reports of apparent mold growth very seriously.  Although it is not something we are accustomed to experiencing at our community, our team members are fully trained to respond, identify and remediate any incidents that may occur.  We do not have record that you have ever reported this type of issue to our team.  It has also been made clear to us that you would prefer to have items replaced versus repaired but unfortunately, we are unable to replace something that is still in working condition or that can be repaired to a working condition.  We sincerely apologize that you find our repairs not to be to your satisfaction but hope you can understand that our buildings are not brand new, therefore, we are unable to provide you with a brand new apartment home.  Our records indicate that the carpet stretch request is still pending.  Since you have not provided us with permission to enter the premises without your being present, our team has tried multiple times to schedule an appointment with you to make this final repair.  It has also been reported that you wedged a screwdriver into the door to ensure our team was unable to enter the apartment to make the requested repair.  To date, we still have not heard back from you regarding our many requests to schedule an appointment for this final repair.  We thank you again for providing us with your feedback and we hope that the remainder of your stay with us is a much more pleasant experience.'}< /resp>

<review>This is an excellent pet hospital. It is the cleanest that I have been to in the area and has no odors, as a hospital should be. They are also caring and professional from my experience.

I took my 17 year old cat Max here after reading all the positive reviews. She was unable to eat or drink anything and acting very confused, I knew something was very wrong. I left her overnight to receive IV fluids and medication. When I went back I was told her unfortunate diagnosis. Unfortunately she was suffering from kidney failure and an intestinal blockage. It was delicately brought up that putting her to sleep was probably for the best because she was suffering and was too weak for an operation. They could have recommended more treatments and it would have cost more money, but Dr. Troxel knew my Max was suffering and told me the truth. Her honesty was very much appreciated.

It was the hardest decision of my life. I grew up with my Max cat from my teens, 20's and into my 30's. She was always there for me. They gave me so much time before having to decide and when I did, they gave me even more time to say goodbye and call family to say their goodbyes to Max. Never once did I feel rushed during this difficult time. Looking into her emerald green eyes as she went to sleep broke my heart and still does. I was a complete mess and never have grieved like that before. I'm just so grateful that the staff and Dr. Troxel were professional and understanding.

I took the loss of my Max extremely hard, I'm still struggling but getting through it day by day. The staff even sent a sympathy card and they signed it all with comforting messages. That was very much appreciated and touched my heart during my mourning. It is not every pet hospital that takes extra time and cares about their patients. Picking up the ashes of my Max made me emotional and speechless but they offer such a beautiful cremation package. I was honestly in shock by how nice the wooden box, name tag and everything was. Holding my Max's paw print again made me smile. It just felt like it was done with honor and respect and gave me comfort.

This was my first experience at the East Valley Pet Hospital and when my heart is ready for another pet I will most certainly be back. I highly recommend you bring your beloved pet here. They are professional, caring, and respectful. Thank you to the staff and Dr. Troxel from myself and my family.<//review><rate>5<//rate><name>David Ramos</name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Our three dogs have each been patients at East Valley... They range from small to large, young to quite elderly, and skittish to sassy. Each has been lovingly cared for and respected. Dr. Graham is patient, gentle, and knowledgeable. We very much appreciate the time she takes to answer questions and the fact that she always follows up. All office staff and technicians are equally wonderful! I would without hesitation recommend East Valley!</Review>< Pictures>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>We brought our cat Carl in for some dental work . We got a estimate almost a year ago, and on that estimate it had a discount. We finally proceeded with the procedure and the discount expired. And the manager was so kind to honor the expired discount. The staff are trustworthy, helpful, Informative and always friendly. We brought in other cats in the past. That sadly past away. And they were so kind to send us a card signed by the staff. Signed so personal to my cat, they even mentioned the funny nickname they gave my cat. I had those cards framed. From a staff that truly cares.

The East Valley Pet Hospital took me and Tommy (a stray I have been feeding) in as a walk in. They fit us in and did all the testing, vaccinating, and even neutered Tommy needed on the day we came in.  I was able to pick Tommy up at the end of the day and move him into my house.  The Doctor, Tech, and other staff were really helpful and explained everything they were doing.  They also followed up to see how Tommy is doing.  Tommy isn't a stray anymore.</text>

Unfortunately, we are not always able to provide a private room to do discharges, especially during times of a high volume of sick or injured pets.  In the event some of our patients are routine discharges, such as a neuter or spay, we would rather not keep the owner waiting for a room to be available.  We always provide our clients with written discharge instructions about guidelines to follow and medications too, besides verbal instruction, I hope you found that helpful.

I was very disappointed in East Valley Pet Hospital when I took my dog in to be neutered.  We had an appointment, however the intake & pick-up were all done in the Extremely busy reception desk.  While the receptionist explained the procedure & cost, there was no sense of privacy & it was distracting with others checking in and out.
While it appears that the procedure went well, the lack of privacy & personal attention were very poor.  I may be changing vets soon.< /Review>

I've been taking my sweet Lola to East Valley Pet Hospital since she was a puppy. My Lola now is 5 years old. The girls at the front desk are amazing! I've never had a bad experience with any of them. Always polite, smiles on their faces and consistently making sure that you and your pet are ok. Lola can be a bit rowdy with the other fur babies. I love their quick thinking and having my Lola and I go inside through the side door for less problematic situations. Thank you girl's!!! There's 2 female doctors at the facility that are absolutely gems! Lola wags her tail when she sees them both! Thank you so much at the staff for taking good care of our 4 legged baby!

<Text>Wish I could give zero. I understand appointments have priority over walk-ins trust me. However when someone has been waiting in the waiting room for two hours with their daughter and a huge very apparent injury on their dog and we have been the only ones in the waiting room the past almost hour and an appointment comes in 2 hours ahead of her appointment hoping to get in early gets taken back before us you have a serious problem. Just tell people you can’t take walk ins and I would have not wasted my time but instead I was told the waiting room was pretty much empty you might wait an hour max come on in...< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80db55b87a41f5bd:0xb08f40ee2910de95< /Gmap_id>< rate>

Our dog injured her knee and needed surgery.  They were so helpful and spent the time answering our questions and helping us along the way. They reviewed all options and made us feel good with our decision. If we were still there, our dog would be in their new physical therapy program.  They are on top of technology and cutting edge treatment options.  If you live in Redlands or surrounding area, this is the nicest, friendliest and cleanest facility around.<//text>< pics>

<Review>I had a great experience here. We have three kittens that we are fostering. At 7 weeks, one of the kittens was having trouble walking. I suspected maybe a broken leg. My vet is located in another town, so I took the little guy to East Valley Pet Hospital, which is right down the street. They got me and Jasper in right after I filled out the paperwork. The Dr was nice and very thorough in examining Jasper. Thank goodness it was just a sprain. The price for my visit was reasonable, also. I plan on using this vet for the care of the three little fosters.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80db55b87a41f5bd:0xb08f40ee2910de95</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

They saved my dog and are so personally professionally. I ran in with my dog, blood on my arms, and without skipping a beat they took her in and confirmed she was stabilized. I was nearly sobbing from fear of what injuries happened from the dog bite, but the staff stayed calm and let me have space to calm down. They kept me updated and took immediate and amazing care. My dog has been back to her normal self before the two week mandate of the cone collar. I would've never expected such quality and personal care from any other facility. The doctor recognized me and my dog each check up, so I definitely feel a huge trust in the staff. I just can't thank them enough, my heart is glowing with warmth now that my baby is back to her regular life. :)< /review>

Wonderful staff and the doctor was excellent.  He took time with us and explained every procedure to us that was needed for our dog.  His staff had a detailed quote completed and went over it with us before care was given.  I really appreciated that.  The office and hospital is very clean.  I felt secure leaving my dog there for his procedure.  The staff kept in touch with us about how he was fairing throughout the afternoon.  Just amazing customer service.< /Review>

We took our dog in for some shots and also a bump she has on her back. In the process of that she had to have some dental work done along with the removal of her lump on her. It was hard to leave her although now that it is done we are so happy. She is like a puppy. They have treated us with such love and also compassion. We received calls each day after surgery to check on her for 4 days. They are so caring and will not hesitate to continue to get all our needs for our precious baby done. They are really busy and that tells me that they are the BEST. thank you so much to the wonderful doctor and his amazing staff.</text>

This has to be the best veterinary spot in the IE. they always take amazing care of my pets and they work with you if you need extra assistance.

Update: I took an older dog in and the vet was not very clear as to why I was giving my dog the medicine. It also seemed like she were really uncomfortable with me for whatever reason, and when I asked the vet spoke VERY quickly and used a lot of medical jargon. I still don’t understand why I gave her two types of pain medicine. She only gave me a weeks worth and said to come back in two weeks. How does that help my dog when she is going a whole week without medicine?

Also, being closed on a Sunday is ridiculous. Most people work Monday through Friday, so this is forcing people to go elsewhere.<//Text>

<Text>Had dog misdiagnosed and seen by all three vets!  One of them told me she would not see the dog again and that I had to take it to a specialist. She had a piss pore attitude.  Took my dog to Loma Linda Animal Hospital where she was diagnosed with a failing liver, not a spinal problem which East Valley vet suggested. My poor dog was in so much pain and every time I brought her in, they treated us like such a bother. Overheard one of the ladies state that eventually owners will just put their painful dogs down.  Well honey, I'm here to tell you that's not true and my dog survived because of a second opinion and treatment.  Because you didn't know how to treat my dog, you placed her on so many meds and nearly killed her!!!  Will never recommend your place to anyone who loves their pet.< /Text><gmapID>0x80db55b87a41f5bd:0xb08f40ee2910de95<//gmapID><Rating>2< /Rating>< resp>

East Valley really cares about my dog and are concerned about making him comfortable. The staff is always nice and helpful no matter how many questions I ask. I am having the K Lazer done on my dog and what a huge difference it's making on his mobility, I highly recommend it.  I would recommend East Valley Pet Hospital to anyone whom needs/wants a one time vet or an on-going vet. I am glad that I found them.

<Text>I loved the doctors there as well as the staff, they were very caring with my dog. He loved the vet also, he gave him a big kiss after his exam. they followed thru after the visit with a call as too his progress. They are available 7 days a week and have the equipment to do most diagnosis tests there in their office. The cost was also very reasonable.
I highly recommend East Valley Pet Hospital.

East Valley Pet Hospital is very loving and caring to its patients and owners.  I have taken multiple pets there and they have always been treated with love and affection.  A couple of months ago I found a baby bird that had fallen out of its nest.  I did not know what to do for it so I took it to them and they kindly took care of it for me.

The staff is great!! The vets are great!! Over the past two years, prices have gone up. But at the end of the day, my dogs are worth the best care I know they provide. Thank East Valley Pet Hospital for being so honest, so caring and so respectful.<//review>

I moved to the area and had no established vet for my dog. She ate a 7oz Hershey kiss... the whole thing! I took her here with very little expectations. The staff was very professional, explaining the payment process at each step of the visit which I like because I felt I knew beforehand what they wanted to do before they did it and how much it would cost. I ended up having to put her to sleep that day due to kidney failure. Again the staff was very professional and knew how to handle this stressful situation with dignity  and respect for myself and my dog. The Dr was very compassionate  but not overly sappy which I liked. He gave me all my options and was very thorough in reading all the results.  He was supportive of my decision and when he came in to put her to sleep he even asked God to please forgive him and was very sensitive to my dog even though I am sure he has to do this all the time. A week later they sent me a personalized card with their sympthy. When I got my dog's remains they came in a beautiful cedar  box with her paw print, a bit of her hair, and seeds to grow to remember her by. This far exceeded  my expectations and was very sweet closure for my two boys. Overall I would definitely  recommend  this vet hospital and will certainly take my next pet there.< /text>

<Text>We have used East Valley Pet Hospital for all our animals for more than five years. Our animals are all rescues and very much a part of our family. They have had surgeries, check ups and sadly end of life care for a couple of our senior pets. Every dealing has been met with professionalism and compassion. I would recommend for all animal needs.</Text><response>None< /response><UserId.>106755373674210528875</UserId.>< GmapID>

This has been the best vet experience I have ever had. All of the staff and doctors take care of my little dog, and really care about the well-being of all animals. I even recommended my mom to take her dog to East Valley Pet Hospital and she loves it as well. Thank you for such a loving place to take my baby too.</text>

<Text>For the shot clinic on Wednesday 07/20/16 it was great. I was greeted and I said I was there for the shot clinic she pulled up my account.  I paid for the services and within minutes I was called back.  I was in and out in about 10 minutes tops.  A so much better set up to get clients in and out in a much faster time.< /Text>< Rating>

East Valley Pet Hospital was awesome! Raider our one year old Beagle got bit by something and swelled his face up to where his eyes where only slits. When we arrived there was a tech in the parking lot she saw him and took him in and right into the back for the vet to attend to him. We where informed every step of the way and are pleased to say that Raider is doing great :) Thank you to everyone at East Valley Pet<//review>

I have been seeing Dr. Chauhan since the beginning of EVPH in Mentone. Periodically I have had to see other vets but feel most at home with Dr. C. The staff is always professional and friendly, giving me time and compassion. I've tried another vet closer to me but came back to EVPH!<//Review>

I've been taking my dogs here since East Valley Pet Hospital opened it's doors. There has been a lot of changes and improvements over the years. There is now a whole section for pet physical therapy. One of the best additions is Dr. Dana Graham. My dogs and I are always treated well.</text>

<Review>My dog was recently diagnosed with a heart condition. Dr. Graham and the staff at East Valley Pet Hospital were kind and caring. In addition, Dr. Graham followed up with me making sure I understood my dog's condition and how to medicate and monitor her. I'm very pleased with the quality of care I received.</Review>< user>

<text>This place is very clean and has friendly staff. I went to the clinic hours for less expensive vaccinations for my two cats. If you are a cat owner be strategic about the time of day go.  They do get a lot of business during their clinic hours and dog owners come in with their pups on long leashes. Going to the vet is extremely stressful for a cat and it doesn't help when the dogs come over and start licking my cats crate. It would be nice if they had a separate waiting room for cat owners.< /text><Name>Brianna Kurtz</Name>< date>

They are amazing.  Great service and wait times are minimal...I couldn't be happier they saved my dogs life and help to keep the costs down because they really wanted to help.  And they did...I will always take my animals here because I know they are in a safe and clean environment with a staff that truly cares.

Thank you so much!!!</Text>

The best vet hospital in the area by far!  This is the only place I will take my pets.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and I've found that the doctors stay current on the latest procedures, and medications.  The doctors are also easy to work with, and actually spend time with you and your pet, rather than rushing you out of the exam room after an allotted 10 minutes like most places I've tried.  Convenient hours, some meds are compounded in house, and some lab testing is also in house.</review>

I take my 3 dogs to East Valley Pet Hospital after trying many different vets over the years. The biggest concern for me is getting good quality care but at an affordable price. They try to keep my costs as low as possible while still being kind and friendly and giving my dogs all they need.< /Text>

Me and my family put our German Shepard of 10 years down a few weeks ago and this place went above and beyond with the care for her. First they  were the only pet hospital near us that were open on a Sunday, they treated us and our dog with so much care and respect during this time. And also we got the ashes of our dog, which you don't have to but we did because she was such a huge part of our family, but they included an outlining of her paw, a piece of her hair, and a note along with the ashes. Personally this was the best place that we could have chosen to lay our dog to rest at. I completely recommend this place for anyone's pets needs.<//Review>

East valley had me come in they did a physical and blood work. They had me pay near $200 for that with the blood work they only could do so much and said things look okay. But to be sure had to pay an extra $150 to send it out. But they said to them he looks like he only had high thyroid. So took their word. Cat kept getting worse took him there again same routine. So luckily my sister took him to her vet at LOMA LINDA PET HOSPITAL. He knew something else was wrong check him physically felt a bump did an x Ray. Took his blood work. Cost about $200 all together and he assured me my cat had cancer and high thyroid and had days to weeks to live. Recommend options but since my cat was 16yrs old it would be hard on him to go through chemo. So I had to put my cat down and wasn’t mentally or emotionally prepared. East valley had me spend a good penny over few months and diagnosed my cat wrong. And gave me hope . Worst place BIG 0 STARS. Thanks east valley for not giving me time to prepare for a family pet to pass.< /review><Resp>None<//Resp>< username>

<Review>Have had several Vets and have to say that this hospital is up there as one of the better ones. The doctor took her time to explain my pets condition and answered lots of questions. The girls called the next day, Sunday, to check on my pets status and the doctor called the following Monday to confirm tests results and follow-up treatment. Looks like I've found my vet!</Review>< Pictures>

Friendly, courteous, and professional staff and vets.  Have been taking our dogs there for several years and have received excellent care.  Have always been provided with estimate before services, and it is great that they are open 7 days a week.</Review>

The staff is super friendly and the vet is great. They sat down with me and showed me how to clean my dog's ears since he had an infection. The vet examined my entire dog including his teeth even though we were just there for his ears. A little pricey but definitely worth the care that is received.<//review>

We couldn't be more appreciative with the staff and doctors at this hospital. They helped and explained everything for us. Unfortunately we couldn't help our old dog. She was cared for and they helped us make the right decision. We would love to thank the staff and provider who helped our little one. We would definitely recommend this place.</review>

I want to thank the entire staff at East Valley for the outstanding care my German Shepherd received when she was bit by a rattlesnake. My gratitude is endless. Miss Clyde has made a full recovery and I know that would not be possible without the kind hearts and skilled hands of the physicians and nurses here. I appreciate all that you do.
Many thanks</text>

<Review>Truly appreciate all of you at EVPH and how you have taken such great care of Upton (English Bulldog 5-yrs old) since he was a puppy.  A few surgeries, chipping and some illnesses... we have always been treated great and very well looked after.

I was pleased that although I did not have an appointment, because I was worried about my cat's medical condition, I was encouraged to come in and wait for an opening in the schedule, an opportunity I greatly appreciated!!! I waited about an hour, which was very reasonable for a non-appointment.
Dr. Graham treated my cat Wonder very professionally, examining her thoroughly for the extreme constipation we suspected. She spoke very specifically and knowledgeably to me, suggesting different scenarios for  what Wonder's  exact problem could be, and offering some solutions.
When I agreed to go ahead with an xray, Dr. Graham was very thorough in explaining what would be done, and the cost involved. Afterward, Dr Graham went over the xray with me.Very impressive. I returned several hours later to pick Wonder up after her enema . The office staff was lovely and gave me specific directions on how to administer the medicine orally. The next day Dr Graham left a message asking how Wonder was doing, and advising what to expect/look for in the following few days. Again, very impressive!<//Text>

I had my dogs Lucy's ears cleaned out, and everyone treated us so nicely. We I also by prescription dog food from my shitzu who has urinary problems from them. It's nice to know we have a vet hospital so close that is there 24-7 to take care of our furry family members.<//text>

I have two dogs that have been seen by vets at East Valley Pet Hospital. The staff is great, always friendly and helpful. The vets really care about the animals they treat. Dr. Chauhan provides helpful information and listens to what I have to say about my pets. He even called me the next day to check on my dog after a serious health scare. Dr. Jammu took time to explain in detail the test results for my dog, which was very appreciated and provided peace of mind. I will continue to take my pets here where I know they will be well cared for. Their hours of operation are fantastic (Saturday and Sunday!!) and prices are reasonable.< /text>

I brought my 13 year old dog there for the first time.  She does not like to walk on tile floors. The minute I opened the door the staff greeted us and went and got a blanket for her. One gal even came outside and helped with the paperwork, noticing that I was visibly upset with the symptoms going on with my dog. We did not have an appointment and the wait was understandably a little long, but they were all so kind and helpful.  The follow-up calls to check on her and share lab results were much appreciated.</Text>

Our boy was seen by the vet and we were advised how to take care of an injury.  Just charged for a visit.  On his followup the doctor released him and  didn't charge us.  I thought they were very professional and gave us easily understood advice.  We would certainly return when needed.<//text>

This is the best veterinarian hospital. Everyone is kind and compassionate. Dr. Chauhan and the rest of the staff are all amazing. They listen and explain things. We have taken all of our dogs here through the years and have had nothing but good experiences. Sadly, my 11 year old German shepherd dog died shortly after surgery to remove the huge tumor. The staff and Dr. Chauhan were very compassionate through it all. That dog was my baby, my shadow, my best friend and it was and still is very hard for me to think about losing her. I wouldn't have changed how the staff treated myself and my family through this hard time. They were all kind and compassionate and supportive. I highly recommend this office.<//review>

< review>
I took my sick kitten to East Valley Pet Hospital after Green Valley Clinic in Yucaipa was not getting her well. I loved that the vet checked everything on her (eyes, nose, ears, throat, bones, heartbeat and lungs), unlike her previous vet and spent a good amount of time with my pet every time, showing care and concern. Dr. Troxell also went over her paperwork from the shelter that I brought, letting me know which vaccinations and treatments she had received. After two weeks under their instruction and care, my kitten fully recovered and was able to receive her vaccinations. The prices are adequate and staff is always efficient.</review>

<Time>1468942801104</Time><pics>None<//pics><text>Everyone was very friendly, the place was clean and very nice looking. The vet seemed to really care about my pet. The only issue I had was when I was called back, the tech took my cat to the back to "check vitals" as she said, but then left her back there for nearly a half an hour while I waited alone in the room for the vet to come in. That puts added stress on the animal and its owner. I've never had a veterinary clinic take my pet away from me to the back, they've always just done what the need to right there in the room. I've gotta say I was not a fan of this practice... I want to be able to see and know what's going on with my pet. If it wasn't for that, this would have been a 5-star review.<//text><Resp>None</Resp>< user>

<text>my dog got ran over and we rushed him there and when we got there, the whole staff was rude, you could tell they were saying things to just get our money, the lady at the front desk had an attitude and another lady that talked to us did aslo, the only person that didn't have an Attitude was a fill In vet because the actual vet wasn't there that day. He talked to us and made us feel comfortable about what was going on with our dog. Even throughout the whole visit he kept us updated on everything asap. Very nice gentleman. Didn't give us dirty looks like the staff did, and shook our hands and made us feel a bit better about our dog, a true animal lover unlike the staff</text>< pictures>

< Review>
After spending nearly $250 at another vet and being told to go to a specialist in Ontario, I scheduled an appointment with East Valley Pet Hospital, and I am so glad I did! Dr. Jammu was wonderful with my cat, reviewed her paperwork and urinalysis report, performed and ultrasound and got to the bottom of the problem. I had worried it would be very expensive, but was happily surprised at the cost of the visit. I don't think I'll go anywhere else in the future. Highly recommend!</Review>

We were refused service right when we got there. We got there an hour before closing, and we were told that our dogs can not be seen. Thats ridiculous, they didn't even try to make an attempt. They don't know the situation because they did not ask. Its heart-breaking to know that your dog is suffering, and the people that are suppose to help did not bother to try. Do not go there, you are better off going anywhere else.<//Text>< pictures>

<Name>Courtney Dillard< /Name><date>1470145547754</date><Rating>4<//Rating><text>Our 6 year old dachshund/terrier mix needed to be seen (yesterday,) for trouble with his hind legs. Every person who treated our fur baby was very gentle and sweet. The Dr. performed some tests to narrow down the issue and explained clearly why she chose the way she did to treat our dog.

I'm not too familiar with trips to the vet, so I can't tell you if they overcharge or not but FYI:

They do charge a $55 fee for Walk In exams.
After blood work, hydration and a prescription for prednisone our trip costs us $282.

Overall, I'm very satisfied with our visit, we were walk in so we knew we'd have to wait but for only being there 3 hours, I can't complain. I'm staying positive our fur baby is on the road to recovery.< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80db55b87a41f5bd:0xb08f40ee2910de95</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Our precious chihuahua had a spider bite that turned toxic.  It resulted in a huge abscess that required that our doggy to have surgery with an incision covering one half of his torso.  The staff at East Valley Pet Hospital were very professional, kind and caring.  After he went home, they even called that evening to see how he was doing.  He had to go back every other day in order to have his wound tended, so we really got to know these people.  They are all amazing and this is the only place I would ever take one of my pets to.  They didn't treat our dog as an animal, they treated him as one of the family!!  5 stars can't say enough.< /review>

<Review>They didn't pay attention to how many shots they were going to give my dog. They were going to give my dog the same shot twice. There is not enough communication between the employees. One employe gave me attitude on the phone! I wouldn't recommend this place. I brought my dog here to get fixed not over dose!

<review>I can't say enough good things about East Valley Pet Hospital.  The folks there from the receptionist, to the Doctor, treat you with kindness, courtesy, and true concern for your fur kid.  They will tell you the best course of action, exactly what will be done, and exactly how much it will cost, No Surprises.  We had the procedure done, and they actually called me, well before they said our furbaby should be ready, just so we didn't worry any longer than necessary. Who does that?  East Valley Pet Hospital, that's who!  Needless to say, I will never take our furbaby anywhere else, ever!  If you want kind, courteous, and professional care for your fur kid, you need to go to East Valley Pet Hospital.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<text>I relocated to Redlands in 2015 from northern CA, and as soon as I moved, my cat began showing signs that concerned me.  I brought her in to EVPH because I could get her seen that day.  She was diagnosed with kidney disease.  The care she has received has been top notch.  The staff know her by name (and me too) and they are a caring group of people (and Mama Cat is always a joy to see too!).  They can get pretty busy some days, but they are kind and patient and do a great job of letting you know what to expect.  I also appreciate that they give you an estimate of what the cost of treatment wil be BEFOREHAND. I've never had a vet do that before!< /text><user_name>Dawn Strough< /user_name><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmap_id>

<text>I was highly impressed with the staff and dr. Graham I had gone here on a second opinion my pet had been seen by three different vets at another local pet hospital each of those doctors diagnosed my pet with first hot spots on her body she had three patches about the size of a nickel where all the fur was gone the 2nd doctor said allergies we went on a three-week treatment which consisted of twice-a-week baths with a special shampoo and steroids when she became worse they said she going to need every other day baths that there must be something in my backyard that she's truly allergic to the third visit I saw a different doctor he said and mind you 50% of my pet's hair is gone by now I'm $600 + into her treatment he said that perhaps it's something wrong with her inside that we would have to do skin biopsy additional testing blood urine there may be something actually wrong with her and that she has 11 years old that you know she's had a good life fast forward  a week because I didn't have the extra funding to get my  pet complete workup of everything  I found out  that a fellow bowler was a vet  I briefly spoke with dr. Graham on a Wednesday evening  explained  to her what my pet had described the situation and what we have done over the last 8 weeks with my pet she said bring her in and we'll do a skin scrape very an evasive scraping some cells off of her skin and I'll look to see what could cause the problem I called the next morning got a 10 appointment by 11 we are walking out the door with a correct diagnosis my pet had a yeast infection on her body</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><gmap_id>0x80db55b87a41f5bd:0xb08f40ee2910de95< /gmap_id><username>Penny Adams</username>< Date>

<Text>These doctors really care about you and your pet. There is nothing they wouldn't do to help out a sick animal or to tell you the truth when everything has been tried and it is just time to let go. They are compassionate in all aspects of your pet's care. I would not take my pets anywhere else. I totally trust them and their recommandations in my pet's wellbeing and health.<//Text>< Pictures>

I would recommend everyone who is looking for a compassionate, caring and knowledgeable to see Dr Jammu.  He was able to diagnose my Cocker Spaniels heart condition very early which allowed me to enjoy him for another 4 years.  He does not request you do unnecessary test just the ones you need.  Once I am ready to bring another dog into my home Dr Jammu will be our Doctor once again.</review>

I managed to bring two dogs in but only one needed his vaccination. Not much of a wait. The staff had priorly advised me to bring in my pets closer to 5PM for vaccination . This works well.</Text>

< Review>
Very helpful, kind, caring, and very experienced place.  They are very honest, and i can say money is irrelevant to them.  My dog was very sick from eating change. They would have done surgery, then id have to take her to ER to stay overnight. It would have cost about 4,000.00 total.  She recommended me to get it done there, so i didn't have to pay twice.  It saved me thousands.  Unfortunatly They couldnt save her.  East valley knew what she meant to me.  She was my world.  I was broken, then 2 days later they sent me a card,  and everyone signed it.  Just lil things like that, show how thoughtful, kind, and comitted they are to their clients. They actually called the ER vet, to ask about her.  Who does that, and cares soo much.  Just a great place!!

Last year, when our Rottie mix crossed the rainbow bridge, it was a very horrible day, but they were SO kind and compassionate during such a difficult time. Later that year, my Yorkie became very ill and they saw us on a very regular basis. The care we got during another very emotional time was just as though we were family. They saved her life. Recently we got a Rottie puppy and went through all the shots, neutering, etc with him there. Our German Shepherd has been fairly healthy, so has only been there for her shots. All of our furbabies have always been loved by the staff here. They truly care.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

First time here and everything was really awesome the girls are very sweet you can tell they generally do care about the animals that they care for they do have an timeframe for you to get shots for your pets and you was going to be a little busy because they have that time frame but yet it went really fast and really smooth I definitely recommend this place<//review>

<GmapID>0x80db55b87a41f5bd:0xb08f40ee2910de95</GmapID><Review>One thing I urge people to remember is doctors of any sort can have good and bad reviews based on the patient preference. I feel the same way with Vets. I absolutely love my dog and heard great things about East Valley Pet Hospital but almost didn't bring him in because of the yelp reviews.

I had just gotten off work and pretty much every vet in the area was closing, including the vet I had originally set up in town when I moved to Redlands not too long ago. I was hesitant but I really wanted to take my poor doggie in to get him checked out for a mystery lump that had caused him to not want to use his hind leg.

I AM SO GLAD I DID! The office has a very pleasant receptionist who just started a week ago at this facility. She was very nice and very attentive. I did not have an appointment and they were doing their shot clinic so I was very worried when I walked up that I would be there FORVER, but I was attended to immediately, got all the forms filled out and sat down. I only waited about 20 minutes, which if you are a pet owner who has made appointments at the vet before you know 20 is absolutely fantastic. Especially after not even having an appointment.

The Nurse(Vet assistant) and the Dr. were very nice! they were gentle and calming and talked to my dog just like the rest of us crazy animal lovers.

The fact that they are open later than other vets in the area AND 7 days a week gives them a little more justification if their prices are a few dollars higher than some of the local vets. The Office Visit cost was $45 dollars, I am not sure if they have separate pricelists for non-appointment and appointment but $45 was not out of the ordinary for a vet visit in my opinion but a lot of people say they are a bit more expensive than Redlands is used to. I will gladly pay that again in a non-life threatening emergency visit for my dog, I didn't need to make an appointment, they saw me within a half hour of getting there, they were pleasant and gentle and they knew what was wrong without convincing me to do some sort of outlandish testing that costs in the thousands ( I had a vet in yorba linda do that 2 years ago, an x ray for gas! he wanted to make sure there wasn't any underlying causes...)<//Review><user>103806293024260312959<//user><name>Melissa Salazar</name>< pics>

<Review>The doctors and staff at 'East Valley Pet Hospital' provided quality care to our best friend, "FiFi" over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend while visiting family in Forest Falls. In addition, since we are from out of town and referred to their office, we did not have an appointment. They offered for us to bring FiFi in as soon as possible before their business day got busy. Dr. Troxel examined her, suggested x-rays to confirm her diagnosis. BTW, FiFi did great at the office. Normally, it is not one of her favorite places. She is doing much better. Thanks to everyone at East Valley Pet Hospital for helping us during a stressful time. Larry & Nancy Macri, Murrieta, CA<//Review>< gmap_id>

<time>1492808175051< /time><review>If I could give 10 stars I would!! In all seriouslness this is the best place to take your furry family members. I recently had to say goodbye to my 15 year old cat Bubba and they helped to make it the best experience considering the circumstances. Dr. Troxel was incredibly patient while we asked questions, and very kind and comforting during the entire process. The receptionist was kind and talked to us while we checked in. The assistant that came in to walk through the paperwork was kind and patient and even offered to have the receptionist come to the room for the payment and signatures instead of us having to go to the front desk all teary eyed and emotional. Literally everyone was kind, patient, caring, and offered their condolences. You can guarantee that I am going to recommend this place to anyone and everyone. I had previously taken my pets (emergent visits) to the hospital in Grand Terrace, and regular visits to the Redlands Animal Hospital, and they are great, but East Valley Pet Hospital is outstanding in the truest sense of the word. I was surprised to see that the fee for aftercare includes a company that scatters the ashes of your furry loved one in the ocean. I was touched that less than a week later I also received a card from the staff offering their kind words, along with a footprint of my little guy on the card. The facility is clean and welcoming. They have a rehab center as well. I can really feel that the staff cares for the animals and their owners. Thank you, sincerely, EVPH!!</review>< rating>

My husband and I took my brother and his wife out for dinner here and it was such a bad experience. If I can give them no star I would. The worst customer service EVER!!!!!!! No water refill, we had to ask them and when the server came, our cups were only half way filled no ice the water so warm we didn't even want to drink it. The first two rounds of meat came fairly quick, but they lagged sooooooo much on the third round for our next order. We ended up leaving. If you say its all you can eat. I'm sorry we were the ONLY CUSTOMER they said. They were DEAD, NO OTHER CUSTOMERS. The meat they gave us were so little it barely fed 4 people. It was all of our first time being there, they didn't even make us feel welcomed. I paid $157 for 4 people for what! ALL I CAN SAY IS WE'RE NEVER GOING BACK THERE AGAIN!!!!</Review>

The inside of the restaurant looks great. The staff were all super nice and friendly. The food tasted great! I would suggest coming here for dinner because an hour lunch won’t be enough time to enjoy the food :)<//text>

<review>Whenever I'm in the Roseville area, Blue House is my go-to spot. We ended up stumbling upon Jiu Jiu after being told there is going to be a long wait at Blue House.

We called Jiu Jiu and asked how long wait was and they told us there was no wait right now. We got there we were seated right away. The menu is pretty extensive and it all one price. There are alucard items that are not included in the all you can eat menu, but the AYCE menu is really awesome. This place is authentically Korean and there are definitely a ton of families that come here.

Service can be a little bit slow at times just because I don't think they have enough staff, but overall it's decent! I've been here twice and have not been disappointed at all. They also have a ton of side options like ramen, or cold noodles. I highly suggest getting the boiled dumplings because they're so good! The plaza it's in is kind of sketch at night time because they are the only thing open besides the liquor store on the corner. This place is definitely a hidden gem!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x809add610073d241:0x4d060cd44f7fc6e7</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Went on a Sunday right when they opened (noon). We were a party of 3 and opted for the all you can eat bbq.

Staff are very friendly and nice. The service was good but not amazing. My water cup was never refilled and at the end of the meal, we had to go up to the counter to get their attention that we wanted to pay for our bill. Nothing major but for some folks that matters a lot. There were maybe three or four other parties in the restaurant during the time we spent there.

The interior seems new and is really nice. At the current moment (April 2021) they don’t seem fully open so there’s some bussing carts around that make the place look a little clunky. The area where we were seated was nice though.

The food is pretty good and they serve it to you in smaller to medium sized portions. They let us order 3 appetizers and 3 meats and when we finished they would let us order more, again 3 apps and 3 meats. They switch out the grill in between orders. All the meats we ordered were good - beef belly, brisket, bulgogi, and pork belly (marinated, sliced, normal). All the banchan (side dishes) were good.

For the appetizers I’d recommend the tteokbokki (spicy rice cake), green onion pancake, and japchae. We didn’t love the seafood tofu soup, dumplings (neither the boiled nor the deep fried were amazing), steamed egg, or the cheesy corn.

Overall a pretty pleasant experience. Would I come here again? Sure! But I’ll have to be pretty adamant about asking for water refills.< /Review>

<Text>Came here one time so far and we did the all you can eat bbq. Food was really good. The staff are very nice and check on you frequently. Only thing that could be different is being able to choose what veggies to order for the barbeque. They give you a variety of veggies but the server did not know what veggies we would be given either. Would rather not be given some veggies that I would preferably not eat.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x809add610073d241:0x4d060cd44f7fc6e7< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Best Korean restaurant Sac has to offer. The all you can eat at 36 bucks a head has more options thsn blue korea house, blue house, gangnam or daikon. It includes chinese bbq. I liked the gantajang pork bone stew, the brisket is fresh and the banchan is nice. Family owned mom and pop who care about their clients.< /text>

I have been coming here for 40 years. It has been my go-to when craving Korean food. Today I notice it's changed ownership. The place has been remodeled and looks great new tables/ booths. The new owner talked with me for a good ten minutes. Service was great, every employee that walked by my table, made I contact and asked if I needed anything and how I was doing. I am not Korean not do I speak it short of the dishes I like. So to be treated this way as a solo diner who orders water.
Thank you for a great lunch. The food was spot on.</Text>

I brought my brother and sister to this place to eat again tonight and had a blast.
We ordered Lamb, Beef, and Chicken Kebabs.  In addition, we also ordered the Lamb with Cumin and Chinese Broccoli and everything was very delicious.  It was also fun to see how the Kebabs are cooked since there is a grill in front of you with coals.
Will be back!<//Text>

I took my girlfriend to this Korean BBQ restaurant for a late Sunday dinner, and we liked their service and food, especially their lamb kabob.<//Text>

This place is nicely designed, clean and fresh looking. The seating in the back is a little awkward as the benches are pretty far from the table (about 2 1/2 feet?) so if you are a regular sized person you have to bend over at the table. The food is actually pretty good. We ordered the LA Galbi and it was around $16 about half the price of other similar places. Our biggest issues were two main areas. 1. The food took a long time to come out. We ordered the following LA Calbi (30 mins to come out), pancakes (25 mins to come out), cold noodles (20 mins to come out, wife said it was good), warm noodles and ramen (1+ hour to come out) and they messed up on the order and brought out the spicy warm noodles when we ordered the non-spicy one (for our kids). We reminded them 3-4 times and asked for updates during that time and was told each time it was coming. It got to a point where we we done eating and the kids still didn't eat yet. Also, don't order the ramen there, for $7.99 it was instant package ramen with one egg and nothing else (literally, no garnish, meats, anything). I was also interested in ordering the kebab stuff too and filled out a second menu (you have to fill it out and turn it in) and gave to the waitress and apparently she didn't put in my order. 2. The service, while they were nice, the wait staff's english wasn't passable. They struggled to communicate with us throughout the dinner. Especially when we were waiting so long for our food. The owner, the korean lady came out and figured out they messed up and gave us (and other tables) 2 free sodas and a few bag of chips for the kids and said sorry. That's why it's a 3 star review instead of a 1. Not sure if I would come back here with my family and wouldn't recommend it at this point until they correct their issues.<//text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I have a taste of the grilled skewers, and the snacks are good. Although the location is a bit biased, the wine is not afraid of the alley

So I know why I don’t come to this one .Every-time I give them a try I always get let down. I ordered online with specifics and I got the total opposite of what I ordered. Called to ask what happened with my order no answer called 8 times no answer nothing more annoying is when you order something and sit down to eat your food  wrong complete order.  Also ask for light Mayo, I got all the mayo that was left in the store on this sandwich . I ask for stick ball I got turkey maybe I’m wrong no I don’t think that stickball is turkey now.  Understand you guys get busy but take the time and look at the orders these sandwiches are not $ 3.00 each. Do expect a call .<//text>

Great sandwich, good/fast service. Friendly staff and attentive to customer service. There always seems to be a line, which is a good sign of quality, fast food joint. Plenty of parking, easy accessbfeom nearby streets. Will definitely be returning.< /text>

Our experience tonight was quite a bummer. Placed an order online (giant cheesesteak with extra cheese) and paid with a gift card. Pickup time was 6:13 and my husband arrived at 6:15, at which point he was informed that they were out of bread. They said it would be another five minutes, but he didn't get out of there until 6:35. Now, we get it - things happen and they were obviously busy. But this was particularly irritating because my husband had called just a few minutes before the pickup time to confirm that he ordered extra cheese. They confirmed that he did, but didn't think to mention that they were running 20 minutes behind on their online orders? That would have been a nice detail to share, especially because you'd think they would want to avoid making customers wait in their shop for so long during a pandemic if they could avoid it. The cherry on top? When we unwrapped the sandwich at home, there was a black hair tucked in with it. It was on the shorter side, so we assume it belonged to a dark haired man. Perhaps hairnets are in order? Overall, the experience was a major bummer - a waste of twenty bucks, and twenty minutes of my husband's time since we couldn't even stomach the thought of eating the sandwich after finding the hair.<//text>

My mom and I ordered two portobello sandwiches with no special requests. The young lady who helped us seemed annoyed that we were there. She was restocking the beverage refrigerator when we walked in. Restocking beverages was apparently her top priority. I'd rather make sandwiches at home than be faced with a disgruntled employee.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1618872468172, 'text': "David, thank you for notifying us of your recent experience.

<Review>I visited your store on September 22, 2019 at approximately 5:30pm.  I specifically requested "gluten free" bread as I have a sever allergy to gluten and have had positive experiences eating at Jersey Mike's in the past.  The representative seemed less than thrilled so I made sure to request "gluten free" again and he replied "yeah".  I paid for my sandwich, got home, took a bite to realize it was NOT gluten free.  I immediately returned to your store only to have to wait, and receive nothing more than a "sorry sir...my bad", and a refund.  Jersey Mike's had better be counting their lucking stars that I don't end up in the hospital tonight.  I now sit at home feeling sick and unable to eat.

I seriously want a call explaining to me why my allergy and health are so easily dismissed.  I will not be returning to Jersey Mike's and you can bet I will be finding every means I can to share my experience via every public and social media review that I can.</Review>< pictures>

I went in today to order , as soon as I walked in saw an employee named Logan , at the counter he didn’t even greet me , not even paying attention who was walking in the store.
After a few minutes ha ask if I need to order , then he took my order with bad attitude.
First the music was extremely loud and had to scream, and he wasn’t able to listen either , finally he finished my order with Bad attitude.
I ask to talk to the manager Valerie ( she was very nice ) she did my order again.</text>

I always enjoy Jersey Mike's. Amazing sandwiches, friendly and helpful staff. Everything done the way you like, nothing bad to say about this place. One thing I recently learned after coming here for years is they have a bit of a secret menu for some items, which is done by taking a couple select items on the menu and combining them, by adding there numbers, so for example you like the Big Kahuna #56, but you also like the Chipotle Cheese Steak #43, and wish the Big Kahuna had that chipotle on it. No worries order the #99, it's  ot on the menu, but it is a blend of the 2.< /Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I cannot describe the service that was offered to me today, we arrived, we were trained and apparently the “very busy” Manager only commented for a moment and left us standing for a long time, which I approached with the cashier and asked him why They were taking so long because my mother is an elderly person and she just wanted to know how much longer she would have to wait and she answered me very rudely, alluding to yes. Or I was seeing that they are busy but of course he was so stopped doing nothing and I asked for him and he asked me what he was asking for it or what he wanted it for ????? To which the manager apparently did and I commented that I work in customer service and that never in any jersey Mikes had treated me in this way VERY BAD EXPERIENCE to tell the truth if I had the option of NOT giving any stars I would do it and I am not upset that I do not buy food if not because of the NO SERVICE that was offered I will not recommend Jersey Mike again to my relatives here in this branch that there are many who live here in Eastlake because of the service that was provided to me today 23 of May at approximately 1:00 pm was terrible !!!!

(Original)
No puedo describir el servicio que se me ofreció el día de hoy llegamos nos formamos y al parecer el Gerente “muy ocupado “ solo comentó un momento y nos dejó parados por un largo tiempo a lo cual me acerqué con el cajero y le pregunté por que se estaban tardando tanto tiempo pues mi mamá es una persona de edad avanzando y sólo quería saber cuánto tiempo más tendría que esperar y me contestó muy groseramente aludiendo que si. O estaba viendo que están ocupados pero el por supuesto estaba so parado no haciendo nada y pedí el y me pregunto que para que se lo pedía o para que lo quería ????? A lo cual se hacer al parecer el gerente y le comenté que yo trabajo al servicio al cliente y que jamas en ningún jersey Mikes me habían tratado de esta manera MUY  MALA EXPERIENCIA  a decir verdad si tuviera la opción de NO dar ninguna estrella lo haría y no estoy molesta por que no compre comida si no por el NO SERVICIO que se ofreció no vuelvo a recomendar Jersey Mike a mis familiares aquí en esta sucursal que son muchos los que viven aquí en Eastlake por que el servicio que se me brindó hoy 23 de Mayo aproximadamente a la 1:00 pm fue terrible!!!!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Not only do they have the absolute best customer service of any auto parts store in the valley but they may have the best customer service of any retail establishment in Lake Elsinore.
If you value local, family owned small businesses than Longtins is  the place to support.< /review><Name>Nathan owens</Name><GmapID>0x80dc975dfe40b923:0x860fbc342e4ff8fd<//GmapID>< Rate>

I will never go to O'Relleys or Chiefs again.   I bought a part from Longtins and saved 50% from these brick and motor stores. In the future I will only shop at Longtin's and will tell all my friends about their prices and quality.</text>

Lontins auto supply is awesome. If you e er need any kind if part they are the ones to go too. Especially if the other auto parts store dont carry it they ate the ones to go too. I would highly recommend this place to any one. Me and .y mom go to this place all the time for parts. They are family owned and wonderful people. There workers are awesome too.< /review>

Best parts store in miles. These people have years of experience, some with 20 or more. They can find you anything. They care about the customer and are always in a good mood.

I stopped going to other auto parts stores because this one is the best one. Heck these guys can help you. From re threading a screw to finding you a carburetor for your uncommon brand truck thats fifty years old. Simple, this store is good.<//text>

Great, friendly staff that actually KNOW what they're talking about. Unlike most chain stores that have counter people that have little to no experience in automotive. Very competitive pricing and quality parts. One of the last "hometown" parts stores around.</review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Longtin's always gotten me the part, sometimes going out of their way. Once the part was a little late so they put a rush on the part and had it delivered to my driveway. Don't expect that. But it shows they strive for top notch service. Good parts at lowest prices around.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80dc975dfe40b923:0x860fbc342e4ff8fd< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Always great food. Haven't been in a long time thanks to covid but food still tasted great. Such a small restaurant and we always feel so squished together, wait staff tripping over whomever sits in outside chair. Made a reservation and it didn't seem like there was any special consideration for birthday celebration, wouldn't seat us until 4th person of party showed up. 3 of 4 of us would've ordered drinks and appetizers while waiting the 7 min it took for other person to show up<//text>

Passing through we came across this place with very delicious food! My kids really enjoyed their meal...I didn't make reservations but waited first in line and they kindly found us a table.</Text>

<Review>This is the best Italian food I have found in Petaluma. You will love it. It is not large and if you are planning to come for dinner you will need a reservation. Lunch time is less busy and I have not been turned away. The daily specials are fantastic.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Food is absolutely delicious. Had the pork chop, and as much as I loved it I have to branch out and try the rest of the menu. Olive's and bread 'n oil couldn't have been a better palate preparer for what I was about to experience.< /text>< Pics>

We eat there EVERY TIME we are in town. We have a vacation home in Petaluma there otherwise we’d eat there more!!! Best place to eat in Petaluma & in Sonoma County!!  BEST gnocchi in the world (better than any we’ve had in Italy), wonderful appetizers, Petrale Sole, Bruschetta, Pork Milanese & the BEST limoncello dessert! Their Alaskan Customers Dennis & Linda!!</Review>

Although quite busy, our little outdoor table garnered as much attention from the staff as the 8 top with children next to us! The food was very good and the wine list was limited but quite varied. We had a lovely Italian red with our authentic antipasto, panne rustica,   and the wonderful entrees.</Text>

Wonderful restaurant. Ate dinner here back in February of 2020. (Before "Shelter In Place" went into effect). Am watching my calories, so only had Bruschetta and a Caesar salad. Both were perfectly prepared and presented. I'll be on this weight loss kick for a while longer, but pretty soon I'll be able to indulge myself in some of the many fine looking entrees and main courses that I saw being enjoyed all around me. Can't wait!<//Text>

<Response>None<//Response><review>Food was good. Seating outside was open but there were so many flies we couldn't eat in peace. The pasta was good, the cedar salad was ok, and the bruschetta was good. Honestly not the best or worse place I've eaten. Prices are decent but the charge you extra for any changes made to your order and if you split the pasta its and extra $2. It was Meh.< /review><user_name>Ruth Nunez< /user_name><gmapID>0x8085b4e37eb86be5:0x74fa4423bcca4768<//gmapID>< pics>

This Italian establishment serves up delicious entrees and provides great service. It's always better to have a reservation, and request a window seat for a date. Friendly owners and staff. Be ready to open your wallet as the bill is usually more than expected.< /review>

Very good restaurant! I had the gnocchi which was amazing and just melted away while eating, my dad had the salmon which was a fairly large portion and also very good, and my mom had the lasagna which was as equally as good. The place was a little cramped, but it helped to make it feel like an authentic Italian restaurant. Service was quick and kind fun people to be around. Will be happy to go back!</review>

<Review>Everything was wonderful - creamy veggie soup ( want that recipe), caprese freshest basil - lovely tomatoes and yum balsamic.  Entree was a shrimp scampi - lemon sauce ummmm, veggies perfecto!!  Only thing i wasn't keen on was the bread with  onion and cheese?? Too wet for taste. But no points taken off for that. Friendly staff, busy place, fast service.  We had carry out - 20 minutes for fresh delicious food!!<//Review>< Pictures>

Excellent food! We have visited twice now and each time the food and the service have been wonderful. The prosciutto and melone..to die for.  Their pasta dishes are wonderful, but their grilled chicken was something special. A wonderful place to get some down home Italian food!< /Review>

Everything was okay. The red wine I had was good , the pasta was okay. Italian sausage didn't do it for me. If it doesn't have fennel in it it's not Italian. Everything's pretty pricey for what you get. There's just something I don't like about restaurants being and shopping centers. I don't feel like I'm walking into anything special.< /Review>

The family clearly loves what they do.
Some of the best fresh gnocchi you can find.

The food was incredibly good. I grew up on the east coast where Italian restaurants are prevalent like Mexican food restaurantsis here on the west coast. It is difficult to find an Italian restaurant with the feeling of being family while you are there & a menu offering authentic Italian food but we managed to find both of those elements at Caffe Giostra.
At the last minute, on Christmas Eve, my friend & I wanted to try a restaurant, just up the road from where he lives, technically in Penngrove but some would say Petaluma. I called to see if they happened to have a table available but they were packed & for good reason, as we soon found out. I then made a reservation for about an hour & a half later but unfortunately the couple at the table we reserved decided to stay & chat long after they were finished with their meal. It seemed to me like they were on a first date. So instead, we were warmly invited to order our dinner to go, which wasnt a big deal, neither of us minded in the least. We were happy that they were open on Christmas Eve & that we were going to eat a meal from somewhere other then a fast food restaurant. They had a wonderful selection of items on a special Christmas menu. We were both happy with our entrees, as well as with the Caesar salad & dessert that we shared. We will definately be eating there again.
Absolutely 5 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</Text>

For a relatively inconspicuous restaurant tucked into the corned of a strip mall this place is quite amazing. Firstly we had a question about the mozzarella in the caprese salad, not only was the question answered but the container was shown to us to validate. The food was amazing as well, Petrale Sole Dore and Pollo Rustico, both had hearty portions of proteins, veggies and starch. The caprese salad was presented beautifully and quite delicious as well. A overall great referral!<//text>

Doesn't look like much from the outside but this place is always busy- for a good reason, they have amazing delicious Italian food!!! I only go here for my Italian food and I'm never disappointed. The portions are large and I can never finish my plate. I would say this a great lunch or dinner spot for couples or small parties, but I wouldn't take a large group here as it is not a large space. Small, intimate and delicious! Bonus is most of the people who work here are from Italy.< /review>

This is the one place if we’re traveling from Phoenix to Petaluma we go to. Gnocchi like my grandma and great aunt made. Carpaccio that rivals anywhere in Italy I ordered it. Only wish they’d consider branching out to Arizona. This my friends is what Italian food should taste like, and the experience, amazing!!< /Text>

<review>The best risotto I have had. Great Caesar salads and a daily menu with all kinds of choices. There also is a permanent menu if you didn't find something on the daily menu. It feels like old Italy, and the waiters are very accommodating. I would suggest a reservation for the weekends and they do have food that you can call to take out. They give you a lot of food so be sure to be hungry.<//review>< pics>

Do not let the outside fool you. It is like being in a little local neighborhood restaurant in Italy. The food is perfectly cooked and fresh and the service is outstanding!  They have so many dishes on the menu it is hard to decide what to choose. If you go, you will come back again so you can try something else on the menu.<//text>

Tucked away from the road. Cute little restaurant. Very friendly staff. Food is good, but not the best we've had especially for the price. Dessert, the tiramisu and chocolate torte were absolutely worth the money. Not somewhere we'll frequent but glad to have tried it.</text>

<text>Despite being very busy the service was perfect. Our meal was better than we could have imagined. Not being conversant in Italian cuisine I had to ask for recommendations. They took this very seriously and asked questions before making a recommendation. We could have sat outside all evening drinking port and relaxing!</text>< rate>

<text>We are here from Missouri and looking for a good place to eat. We walked in not thinking it was a Friday night and no reservation. They  more than welcomed us. Made room for my wife and me and the waitress was great! The food was over the top and outstanding. I had the seafood over angle hair and my wife had eggplant parmesian. It was one of the best dishes we have ever had. We highly recommend it to anyone that likes great  Italian food.</text></record>

< Review>
The service last night was terrible. I couldn’t even get WATER the first 30 minutes.  I asked for it a half dozen times. Where is our waiter? Who IS our waiter? HELP!  I asked the owner (the short Latina) for the wine list 3 times - no luck. Understaffed and the staff they did have didn’t know what they were doing. We’ve gone there a lot in the last 10 years, really gone downhill.<//Review>

I've enjoyed several fine Italian meals there.  I love the carpaccio (best in the area). Priced fairly for fine dining. A bit on the cramped side,  but that adds to the charm.</review>

<review>I had such high hopes for this meal base on recommendations. First, 6 families  were seated after us and were served before us. We waited 45 minutes after being seated for flavorless risotto and cold rubbery scampi. So disappointing!</review>< time>

Wow, everything I come here I feel rushed! They have 22 tables and two servers! I couldn’t ask questions about the wine list without being rushed.  The server actually told me to hurry up because he had a lot of tables and food up! Really?? And I ordered a risotto made with pesto sauce and shrimp instead of the risotto made with cream, scallops and calamari! They charged me 30.95 for my dish that had only three shrimp! Wow I will never go back! My server did not inform me of any major charge and I feel like they Robb the customer!! In the past when I have been there the owner had always been rude and tonight it was busy but really have more help so that your customers can have better service! What a disappointment and soooo over priced!!! Even the dessert that was described as a chocolate cake covered in ganache was just a chocolate cake!! I give them barely one star!!!<//text>

Food is amazing. I have been here maybe 8-10 times. If my only criteria was food, then it's a 5. But the service here is probably the worst I have experienced. And it's consistently disappointing. They always overbook the place. Probably why you have to wait so long every time. After going today, I will never be returning which is a shame. Like I said, the food is wonderful. But after making reservations for 6:30 and being seated at 7:05 (which happens almost every time, 15 minutes late was the best they have ever done) I was already off to a bad start. Then they waited to within 5 minutes of our food arriving to finally remember to bring our drinks and bread. They didn't tell us about the specials and never came back to fill my water once. The chefs in this place are amazing. The lady cleaning up the tables and bringing bread (black hair in her 20s) was the most hospitable person there. She was very nice. But the short lady waiter is consistently rude and forgets things I ask for. I think she may be part owner or something but she awful.<//Review>

Tiny place that's always crowded because the food is so darn good. Don't be fooled by the out of the way location, this is one of Petaluma's most consistently best restaurants.<//text>

They have an above-average wine list. The food is well prepared and tasty. We found it a little on the pricey side, but we would go back.< /Text>

<text>Generous three stars only because I've had better experiences there previously. Seemed unprepared for Monday lunch crowd. Kitchen, servers both obviously in the weeds. Food sub-par, service spotty, i.e. menu items forgotten, bread delivered not just after salad course, but we were almost finished with entrées when it came. We'll give them another chance, but it might be a while given the great local alternatives.</text><GmapID>0x8085b4e37eb86be5:0x74fa4423bcca4768</GmapID></record>

Excellent food as always...Very small gripe..They have a buy one, get one free coupon. In semi small print, max value is $15..I believe very few dinners on the menu are as low as $15..not enough of a gripe to be less than 5 stars...<//text>

VERY AUTHENTIC!
Great setting and terrific food. Only tried a cpl dishes so far and two deserts but was great food. Bruschetta app is a MUST! The tomatoes they use are excellent. I dont like tomatoes usually unless they r fresh and picked when ripe.
I would of went back tonight but did not want to walk in 15 min till close but i walked by and there was only one table open... I must not be the only one who likes it.
I dont eat at fine u restaurants due to high prices but this felt classy and did not break the bank< /text>

<text>Excellent quality of various dishes.  The freshness of the clams in the Linguini Vongole and the lightness of the sauce is outstanding.  Couple this with supurb service and fair prices makes this spot a winner< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Name>Stephen Harper< /Name><Rate>5</Rate>< resp>

This place is horrible and way over priced. They are very slow unless you want to waste your time don't bother. the waiter was nice but the old lady up front short with brown hair is very rude. As I was waiting to be sat I watched a number of people leave because of her and saw how she treated the guests. I talked with other customers and was glad to see I am not the only person that felt that way.< /text>

Although it is very small, the staff is always accommodating and caring.  I feel like I am at home!  The staff, cooks, waiters, cashier...always wonderful.  I would say there should be two seatings, one at 5:30 pm and the second seating at 7 p.m.  That would accommodate two types of diners.  I always make a reservation and it is best to arrive a lil early and have a glass of wine...The tiny lil place isn't the type of dinning where you stay all night and chat!  I would luv to see Giostra have a place on the riverfront!  They deserve a larger place.<//text></record>

< Review>
Phenomenal service! I am new to the mortgage business and needed a website set up quickly. I chose the Local Pro package with which my background in corporate advertising truly believe is a fantastic package! Very impressed by how quickly they built my website and the teams constant communication with me. I can be picky so sent them two pages of small revisions I wanted which they got done in two days! Look no further! If you're in mortgages you should definitely chose them for your website needs! I don't plan on ever using any other service or company!< /Review>

<Review>I am just blown away on what LeadPops has to offer.  I initially signed up with them to have my 1st business website created as I was referred to them by a co-worker.  I have already met with Ky, Cleve, and Chad, all who are masters of getting me on the track to success as a brand new Loan Officer.  These guys don't just sell a website.  There is so much more technological and psychological tools behind what they have to offer. I truly feel that the LeadPops team I have been given are totally vested in my success.< /Review>< pictures>

Lexi Smiley, my account executive was extremely personable, professional and did a great job explaining the benefits of the LeadPop platform! I have looked at other firms and none have offered such a  complete integrated platform for the price. I would have to spend much more with competitors, to equal the value that LeadPops offers.
I was amazed that I sent an email late at night and Lexi replied within minutes. The service so far has been unparalleled! I'm looking forward to a long and profitable relationship.< /Review>

< Review>
I am blown away by the value so far with Lead Pops. I initially signed up rather quickly just to get a website going. The set up of the website was quick, simple, and they have attended to all of my feedback no problem. Having them take care of that set up alone has been so great, as I am able to focus on other aspects of my business. But the real kicker was when I met with Nick and Matthew. Nick and Matthew took the time to go over my marketing plan and goals. They gave me personalized, actionable advice with easy next steps. They have truly gone above and beyond by aligning themselves with my success. I learned so much in the first meeting. I am looking forward to many more, and in fact, I want to actually upgrade my membership and buy additional services from them. I will certainly update this review as I do.< /Review>

I've dealt with a lot of fly-by-night marketing firms that didn't know what they were doing. BUT Working with the team at LeadPops (Nick, Gabe, Chad et al) I get a professional, friendly group of people dedicated to my success who KNOW what they're doing and have great tools to help me succeed. I highly recommend giving them the opportunity to prove their worth.<//Review>

There are many, many lead generation/marketing companies for Realtors and Loan Officers to spend their marketing budget on.... and I have tried a lot of them (both big and small) with varying levels of success. LeadPops has so far been my best experience. The on-boarding process is smooth, the platform is intuitive, the service is exceptional and the cost is reasonable. Highly recommend.< /Text>

I had heard a lot about Lead Pops, and I was intrigued by their offering. I reached out to them and received one of the fastest responses ever. Their customer service is best-in-class, and their white-glove approach to onboarding is phenomenal. I had the opportunity of discussing Lead Pops offerings with Chris, Tayor, and Nick, who are all highly knowledgeable and very experienced. Thanks, Team, looking forward to a great year!< /Review>

Both Remi and Dara have been nothing short of exceptional! Both have an amazing attitude, they clearly love what they do and equally as important, they know what they’re doing. At first I thought leadPops was an overpriced funnel (like so many out there), but I was WRONG! Now I feel like I got the deal of a life time. I’ve worked at companies were we had our own dedicated team that did similar work (and not as effective as leadpops) and we were spending 1500% more with mediocre results at best. If you’re on the fence about trying them out... JUST DO IT!!!  No! It won’t work overnight, but if you stick to the plan and trust the process you won’t regret it.<//text>

My experience so far with leadPops has been nothing but positive! Remi Newman was my Digital Account Executive for my walkthrough call and you can really tell that she knows what she's doing and has a great feel for the marketing space inside of the Mortgage Industry. I would highly recommend leadPops to any LO looking to expand and organize your marketing efforts at any time of the year.
Just also met Dara at leadPops as my new business coach and she is fantastic as well. This company has an all-star team put together and I look forward to working with him.<//Text>

They went above and beyond what I was expecting on that call. If you have any questions on whether or not to work with leadpops -- STOP hesitating.

<Text>The support team at Leadpops is phenomenal. We are constantly testing things on our end and they are always willing to change up the way our funnels work with our CRM. They are so helpful whenever I have questions and they keep me up to date as they are resolving any issues we have.< /Text>< pictures>

Suzanne has been amazing at helping me customize my advertising. I love marketing but as a slammed mortgage pro, I barely take time to eat breakfast or lunch. Thus when it comes to figuring out systems the team at LeadPops goes above and beyond and Suzanne is my go to girl. Always helpful, pleasant and has great ideas. Mahalo!< /Review>

After 5 years with my previous website, I revamped through Leadpops for a more modern and user friendly format. Josh schedules regular check-in calls to see how everything is going and if there are any changes I'd like to see as well as discuss marketing strategies. I appreciate the responsiveness and attention to detail. Thank you!<//Review>

Leadpops is great at what the do. Easy to use funnels, great looking website delivered ahead of schedule. I honestly don't want to give a review because I want to keep this a secret, it's just that I promised Gabe I'd give one and so here we are. Can't go wrong with this team.</Review>

<review>The entire team at LeadPops, beginning with my onboarding specialist (Shannon Bayrak) was a synergistic symphony of ingenuity and talent!
Admittedly, I was a difficult and demanding client with very specific needs for a real-estate site I was having built and Shannon along with her team members ( Mathew Mohler, Josh Nevelson and I"m certain a dozen other technicians ) managed me with kindness and professionalism which resulted in perfect execution for every issue I presented.  To say we are pleased is an understatement.  For Shannon especially, our company is deeply appreciative of your willingness to help us through this phase of the business development. For any individual or company who may be reading my review; If you are relentless in putting your best foot forward and are seeking a website that will generate results for your real-estate or mortgage business, LEAD POPS IS THE FERRARI OF WEBSITE providers for this industry.

He and his team are super responsive to any updates, changes, requests, etc.  Love the monthly meetings where he holds me accountable for all my procrastination.  For instance, this review should be have done a long time ago.  Leadpops has handled my site and marketing for several months, and there are absolutely no complaints.

I have been working with Kylan Aburto-Pratt on marketing and he has been extremely helpful and professional.  He understands the market and also how to grow your business even in the most difficult of times.  I would recommend both lead pops and Kylan to anyone looking for help growing their business.< /Review>

Josh is very patient and great to answer and explain answers to my questions.  Our last call turned into a complete Q&A and I walked away with homework to improve my social media presence and an understanding on why it's important to structure the way he advises.  We are also setting up a separate meeting to go over google and facebook advertising for my team as well.  LeadPops will give you as much as you can handle and they are meeting my desires on growing my business.  Thanks guys.<//Review>< Response>

Dara Freudenthal is phenomenal!  I've only been using Leadpops a little over a month now but just had my first Marketing Coaching call with Dara on Friday last week.  Not only did she know her stuff, but she got me so motivated and inspired to do great things!  She even did her homework on me and knew I was a huge Tar Heels fan and wore a hoodie!  THAT'S legendary service right there.  All of the agents I have spoken to thus far have really listened to my needs and helped me greatly.  I can't wait to see how far I go with Leadpops. Keep up the good work!!!</text>

After some initial personnel turnover and miscommunications, the LP team turned around some hackers and corrected that damage to social media integrations. Once back on track, the LP team quickly got the social media ads running. We're back on track thanks to Suzanne and Sammie!< /text>

< Review>
Lead Pops is a fantastic site for Mortgage Services, I highly recommend them. It is user friendly for potential clients and the final product looks quite sharp.
I want to give a special thanks to our second representative, Suzanne LaFlamme. She came in after our first sales rep left us wanting more, and without any hesitation helped my boss and I produce the website exactly the way we had envisioned it. She patiently worked through all of our requests and made multiple sets of revisions until we were 100% satisfied. I can not thank her enough for her efforts. If it is possible to request someone to work with at Lead Pops, without a doubt I would recommend Suzanne.< /Review>

I was new to the real estate business and wanted to get some business in the door and get some marketing ideas.  I found a valuable partner in leadpops!   They talk me through what I should be doing, what I shouldn't be doing, and how to market myself better.   I was trying to spend my own money on ads and wasn't having a lot of luck.   Leadpops knows how to market on Facebook and I had leads right away.

The 30 min Zoom calls with Gabe I have are very informative since this was my first business I was trying to market.  They really care about your success and it feels like you are part of a big team when you sign up.  Highly recommend!</Text>

< Review>
I have been working with Kylan Aburto-Pratt of Leadpops since August. The experience has been exceptional. He has listened to my every need(and I have lots of them since I am not that computer savvy), and guided me in the right direction every time. Leadpops is an excellent way to self generate leads. I have been able to start from scratch as a mortgage loan officer by using Leadpops and Facebook funnels.
I would highly recommend both Kylan and Leadpops. The professionalism and guidance is worth every penny spent!< /Review>

Andrew and his team are exceptional. He takes marketing and conversions to an entirely new level. I have used Lead Pops for several years now and can’t imagine what I would do without their lead generating funnels.

Oftentimes these reviews are from clients. Well leadPops is OUR client and they are excellent to work with. You can judge a lot about a company based on how they treat those they hire for service.

Authenticity, professionalism, appreciation are all things we have felt while working with many of the management team. I can only assume they operate at this level with their clients too, and their MANY 5 star reviews seem to also confirm this.</Review>

Suzanne was great to work with.  She clearly is interested in making sure things are done correctly.  There was some lag initially, but as soon as Suzanne get involved, things got done.<//Review>

I've just hired LeadPops & am quite excited to see what's to come. My first experience was with Monica who was so professional, on top of it, patient with my many questions & SO thorough! I can't wait to see the finished website & eager to see how the leads turn out. I'll re-review 2months in....<//text>

< Review>
I have been working with Lead Pops for about 2 full months and so far I have been impressed. They set up my website and run a couple ads for me, so far I have funded 2 loans from their ads and 2 more are in process. The Monthly call is extremely helpful when it comes to managing my online reputation. I would highly recommend to any mortgage pro, real estate agent and insurance agent interested in generating exclusive leads!< /Review>

Signing up with leadPops has been incredibly fruitful already! I had ads turned on with them about 2 weeks ago and the quantity and quality of the leads are FAR better than any other lead source I've experienced. The leads actually remember filling out the ad and are open to speaking about mortgages. Thank you!!!!</Text>

I've had a wonderful experience with Suzanne at LeadPops!  She is prompt, professional, caring, and knowledgeable.  Suzanne went above and beyond to answer all of my questions and provided in depth explanations of all of the features of the LeadPops tools.  She also made herself available following my training session.  Can't say enough about the wonderful support she provides!<//review>

I want to give a positive shout out to the LeadPops! support staff.  They have continued to be responsive, professional, and extremely helpful in helping the First Commerce Financial team get the technical side of our CRM system working with the funnels.  At times, technology doesn't always cooperate, but their team continued to work through the issues until they were resolved, and our team is extremely appreciative for their assistance.  LeadPops! and their team truly is dedicated to ensuring that their clients are taken care of.  A+ experience.</Review>

I have been working with Leadpops for many years. They are an amazing company and I really can't think of a better options for lead funnels. I've tried making my own landing pages with companies like Clickfunnels and although they are good for one off things like single property listings, they are still a bit clunky when it comes to building a long form mortgage funnel. Leadpops knocked it out of the park. Their funnels are very similar to what you get when you go to Zillow but better. Furthermore, they have an excellent website solution and their customer service is top notch! I highly recommend Leadpops.<//text>

LeadPops provided us an excellent website, and now we trust them with our market presence management.  Tim Mikolajczyk and team don't try to over sell.  Instead, they carefully listen to our goals and tailor solutions within our budget.  Refreshing, as so many other companies just care about their own revenue.</Review>

This company is amazing. I have worked with this team for over 10 years. They are great at developing new ingenious and unique lead generation programs that help the mortgage industry.  They excel at customer satisfaction and speedy responses.  They really care for their clients and the outcome of their work. Lindsay, Andrew, Charles, Josh, Peter, just to name a few, are indispensable to our business. My team has increased mortgage origination volume by 24%+, thanks to their efforts.<//Text>

leadPops is by far the best mortgage website / funnel provider in the industry. Andrew, Suzanne, and the entire team are amazing and great to work with.

<text>Hands down, best mortgage-centric company I've ever had the experience of working with. From sales to on-boarding to going live was a seamless transition from my old website, not to mention everything that the site does or can do for you. They can customize to incorporate specific things on your website that you'd like to have highlighted. They find resolutions to your request rather than say they can't do it. I can't speak highly enough about this company. I only wish nobody else was able to use them. :)</text>< Pictures>

If you're buying leads, stop! As the old adage says "Give a man a fish, and you'll feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you've fed him for a lifetime." Leadpops will teach you how to fish. They are great to work with, extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and I'm very impressed how responsive they are. If you don't call and take advantage of their services, you're missing out.</Review>

These guys are really amazing at not only generating and converting customers but serving the customers they have really well. As a VP of a mortgage bank and a leader of a large branch I work with vendors all the time for various spaces in the real estate / mortgage space. Charles and the guys at LeadPops are world class. Wish I could keep them a secret but I am sure the world will know them soon.< /Text>

I've procrastinated in setting up my LeadPops webpage, and Kylan on the LeadPops team guided me through the process over a zoom meeting.  The guy has a fantastic presence on the phone, is patient and thorough, and was able to quickly translate what was needed so I could quickly provide it.  Can't say enough about Kylan, if the rest of the experience with the actual product from LeadPops is half as great, I'm in good shape.< /Review>

Andrew and his team at LeadPops are AMAZING.  The software is the most critical piece of software in my entire company. Yes even more important than our LOS.  Without LeadPops we would be at a huge disadvantage trying to compete for market share.  In fact I hesitated to even write this review because I don't want my competitors to see it. If you are here looking to decide if you should purchase this software stop reading and go buy it now. Don't just stop at the software either. The websites, marketing services and other add on's should be in the tool box of any mortgage broker or loan originator.<//Text>

I definitely recommend  LeadPops for mortgage and real estate professionals!  This business requires that you are visible everywhere that your customers are looking, and the Funnels & Sticky Bars do just that for you.  They offer an exceptionally efficient way to track the leads, and I love the fact that their system integrates so well with our CRM.  Suzanne & the entire LeadPops team are great to work with, and very helpful.  If you're ready to take your business to the next level, this is a great way to do it  without breaking the bank!

<Review>leadPops is absolutely amazing!!! I am so excited to get everything up and running, so far the process has been so easy and seamless. I am super detail oriented and a perfectionist, so when I make requests about the size of the logos, or what a picture looks like they get on it no problem! They go out of their way to make sure everything is as you want it! I appreciate you guys!< /Review>< Pictures>

Andrew Pawlak has recorded EXCELLENT tutorial  videos for this service and occasionally replies to questions in the Facebook groups!

Support has been amazing! When I ask questions, I'm answered FAST. Email replies to their answers are even FASTER (thanks Charles Dean, Peter and the rest of the team).

I'm a website designer and Internet marketing veteran of 20 years. This service SMOKES the other platform I was using. More expensive? Sure. But you know what? My other system didn't instantly get me in the doors of real estate agent offices. SIX MEETINGS in TWO DAYS effort showing this thing off.

Best money you'll ever spend. Promise.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Rating>

<Text>LeadPops and the support crew there is second to none.  I've worked in the social media marketing industry for more than 20 years, been in the real estate industry for 16 years and internet marketing space for over 15 years - and I have found there are good companies and GREAT companies.  This is a great company.  The customer support gets back to you immediately.  The phone calls actually goes to a live, real supportive customer representative who takes care of  your needs in one call, not 3 or 4.  Charles is awesome as my point of contact.  He answered all my questions and addressed all my concerns in ONE call.  Thank you.  Not to mention, the product itself if exactly what I wanted and no there is no need to recreate the wheel and spend hours and hours making my own funnels.  Love it love it love it.  Thanks.</Text>< pictures>

Charles was STELLAR...
Honestly I haven't had a bad call to LP yet, and I'm pretty confident I never will.  Charles thank you for spoiling me, taking my hand and walking me through my questions, not just telling me what to do. I leave this calls smarter, with new possibilities, and capable of doing what needs to be done.
The experience is so good, I just wish I could clone you and this LeadPops service... In fact, I wish you would purchase the support for my cellular company... If you can serve this well, why cannot everyone else LOL</text>

The company I work for started using leadPops last year, as our own funnels were lackluster. From day one, their support team has been so supportive and responsive. The turnaround times are great, and they really take the time to walk you through a problem when you're confused.

Even when things go wrong, they keep at it till the problem is resolved. Great service, great support. Shout out to Charles for being patient with us while setting up some subdomains!< /Text>

I am very impressed with my experience using leadpops. It took me over a year to find an all encompassing system and service that would be an asset for my company’s growth. Needless to say, I lost a lot of money with others before I found the team at leadpops. I wish it had been sooner, but better late then never!

Big shout out to, John, Cathlin, and Andrew! You guys rock! 😎</Text>

The best delivery of customer service excellence in my recent experience is with Sr. Client Marketing Advisor, Josh Nevelson.

It is the time between Christmas and New Year's and leadPops, Inc employees are enjoying time off. I had a number of questions regarding areas not of Josh's expertise but happened to get  him on the customer service line when he answered it.

Josh listened to my concerns and was thorough in explaining answers to my questions. His knowledge of leadPops does extend past his area of expertise and though not his wheelhouse, Josh was able to provide me with the best information he had.

Josh was most pleasant and explained techie things to me in layman's terms so that I walked away with the knowledge I needed and felt most positive about it!

If everyone is of such stellar client service at leapPops, then I am truly impressed. Josh really made my day!</Text>

It takes more than just a good product to impress me. I want to know that the people behind the product share my values, vision and passion for delivering a best in class consumer experience!  LeadPops checks all of these boxes.

I have been blogging about Real Estate and Mortgages since 2007.  When I started, I didn't really understand lead capture or conversion.  For many of the early years I used form builders like Gravity Forms or Woo Forms to convert readers into customers.

What initially attracted me to LeadPops was the book that founder and CEO, Andrew Pawlak wrote called The Mortgage Marketing Manifesto: Unlocking the Holy Grail of Mortgage Lead Generation.

At this point, I had been creating consumer direct content for years.  I was having some degree of success converting that traffic.  LeadPops for me was definitely "the next level".  It was clear by reading Andrew's book that he truly understood conversion and was a master at his craft.  I had no idea.

The last major update I made to my web properties was in 2017.  Looking at it now, there are a bunch of things I could have done better, but by following LeadPops best practices my traffic to lead conversion went from approximately 1% to 2.5% to 3%.  10k unique visitors is not unusual for my website.  What used to result in around 100 leads a month off that traffic was catapualted to 200+ leads a month on average.  That's huge.

After collecting over 5,300 leads using LeadPops, I am still amazed at the pullthrough rates once someone click on the lead form.  My best performing funnels have converted almost 2,000 leads at over a 10% click to complete rate!  Again, this is unheard of.

Online marketing has a lot of moving parts.  Being able to tap into the expertise and vision at LeadPops has been an invaluable ingredient in our recipe for success.

I cannot recommend LeadPops highly enough. Thank you caring enough to create amazing products!< /review>

These guys are on POINT everytime, their service levels set the bar in the client satisfaction arena. This os of course not a silver bullet to but if you follow their techniques and strategies. Charles dean, Andrew Pawlak, Chris Dotinga, and many more...just have the budget set aside specifically for this and you will see the gratification follow...</review>

<Review>As a new Loan Officer, I was referred to LeadPops by a co-worker of mine. I've only been on board for about 60 days, but a partnership with LeadPops has proven to be invaluable!  Suzanne LaFlamme handles my account, and she's always providing me with expert coaching on ways to gain market share. Between the coaching from Suzanne, and the LeadPop leads obtained through ad spend, I've been able to bring on 3 new Referral Partners who assist me in calling my leads, refer me their business because I'm trying to help them grow, and this month alone I have 3 closings from October and November leads for north of $720,000 in loan volume. I will continue to be a fan of LeadPops and will encourage any of my colleagues to jump on the wagon as well.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1575331792614, 'text': "Thanks so much, Trey! We love following your success. Bringing on Referral Partners and closing deals while you're at it is exactly what we coach. Nice work! Can't wait to see you continue to crush it!"}<//resp>< gmap_id>

I am new to LeadPops and have been pleasantly surprised every step of the way. As a real estate professional, I am inundated with tech services and advertising platforms on a daily basis, but LeadPops has delivered on every promise they've made and continue to follow up to ensure I am fully benefiting from all of their amazing content. I enjoy their platforms and find them easy to navigate and customize. 100% satisfied with LeadPops and their dedicated staff. Thank you LeadPops!!<//Review>

<Text>I've been using leadPops' mortgage funnels for nearly 3 years now, and recently started using their Conversion Pro website for my business Philadelphia Mortgage Brokers when we launched in February 2018. To say that leadPops has exceeded my expectations is an understatement. After a couple months of our site being live, we started ranking several times on the first page of Google results with certain competitive keywords in our market. Due to leadPops' superior long form lead funnels and CTAs littered throughout the website, we started receiving organic leads without paying for any advertising! Some of the funnels have a conversion rate of over 6%. We've paid for our leadPops subscription for the next 10 years already based on the loans we've closed and funded. There is simply no company out there today who provides the kind of ROI in the mortgage website/funnel space. Trust me, I've scoured every conceivable service out there. I would highly recommend anyone in the mortgage industry to use leadPops for their website and/or lead funnels. You won't regret it!< /Text><resp>{'time': 1568413468350, 'text': 'Thank you for the kind words, Evan! We appreciate you!'}<//resp>< GmapID>

<review>Lindsay has the energy, tact, and enthusiasm to be a very valuable member of your team. I would feel comfortable approaching her with any problem, and she would be able to point me in the right direction, if she could not solve the problem herself. Her follow-up is never-ending and she is a nice person to talk to.

I feel very fortunate to have Lindsay as my customer contact person.

Thank you,

To say I'm satisfied with LeadPops is an understatement.  The product alone is amazing, a website that helps you sell and creates a great customer experience.  Its very user friendly for someone that is not very tech at all.  I'm most impressed by the level of service that I've received from Charles and his staff.  They are very responsive to emails and I'm amazed at the consistency they have achieved.  A lot of companies preach customer service but LeadPops delivers it every single day.  I highly, highly, highly recommend LeadPops.<//review>

<Text>I LOVE LEADPOPS!

They have really allowed me to stand out in my market. I now come to the table when i meet realtors with leads in hand! WHAT LENDER DOES THAT FOR THEIR REALTOR PARTNERS?!?!?! NO ONE HAHA.

Highly recommend the DO IT FOR ME ADS. Facebook always changes the rules and Leadpops is always on top of it.</Text>< Pictures>

I have been using the LeadPops platform for about 10 months now. Before working with them I might have gotten one or two random social media leads. I had no idea where to start. Since beginning with Leadpops I have gotten well over 1,000 leads. The service is great, they are always quick to respond. They are always developing new tools to help you and even giving ideas on how to better use the platform. I have been able to establish new relationships with realtors specifically by using LeadPops. I am in the process of training realtors in different areas on how to use it. At this point it's paid for itself several times over. I am almost to the point where I am closing 1-2 deals each month with one realtor partner. It's an easy way to grow your business. I would highly recommend this to any loan officer.</Review>

<review>Passion, leads, and results are three words to describe leadPops. I highly recommend them to anybody in Mortgage, Real Estate and Insurance sales that needs more leads. Our new Mortgage website, and sales funnels work great to deliver real time exclusive leads. Andrew and Charles are just brilliant and the huge results speak for themselves. Every once in a while, a company comes around that is a disruptor to change things for the better and leadPops is definitely one. I highly recommend reading the book "The Mortgage Marketing Manifesto" by Andrew Pawlak. Thank you leadPops!< /review><Name>AL MARKUSSEN</Name><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

Unfortunately, we are not offering our services in Australia at this time. It is unsettling to hear you had such a challenge connecting with us. We do not have contracts and believe in a hassle free refund policy. Our Client Success team works tirelessly to keep the fastest response times to requests within our business hours from Mon-Fri 7am-4pm PST. Unfortunately, we received your requests after hours and we apologize for the timezone delays. We are very sorry and have expedited your refund. We will also use this as a learning opportunity to potentially expand our hours of operation. We look forward to earning back your trust when we expand into that part of the world later this year!'}< /response>
