I refer Dr. Pak to all of my friends and co workers. She’s the sweetest. Her staff is just the same. If you’re looking for a new Dentist that listens to you, fixes your problems and makes you feel like family… this is the place.< /text>

<review>Our family has been coming to this dental office since we were kids. The dentist might retire but we just move on with the new one that takes over the practice. Dr. Pak is wonderful! My favorite hygienist, Sue, has cleaned my teeth for the last 12 years and I know they'll replace her with another good hygienist when it's time for her to retire. I highly recommend this place to anybody</review>< response>

<text>Amazing, amazing dental office! The staff is so caring and accommodating. I have mega anxiety about dental work, and they are so good about that! Dr. Pak is professional and amazingly efficient with her work. I’ve literally never had a cavity handled so well. Both her and her assistant were super friendly and helped talk me through everything which was a major relief. The office staff, Jody, I believe, is so nice and friendly.
Also, they have the office very much COVID-19 ready and follow strict guidelines to keep everyone safe. So bonus points for that. And lastly, each little operating room has a great view of the patch of forest behind the office.
I lucked out finding this dentist, I am actually not nervous to go back!<//text>< pics>

<review>Dr. Pak and her staff are super nice, professional, and relatable including the office manager,  dental assistant, hygienist and the doctor. They were gentle with my teeth and didn’t try to push for unnecessary dental work. I feel like they really want the beast for me and my teeth not what’s best for their pocket book. A+ service and care in my opinion. Thank you team Pak!< /review><gmap_id>0x809b1f6897d9eba3:0xdb599cd8d6d654fa<//gmap_id><Resp>{'time': 1598971662377, 'text': 'Thank you for the kind review Shawn.

<Text>Our experience with Dr Paks office has been great.  We had seen Dr. Meaglia in the past and were very happy with him but now that he has Dr Paks and new staff we were hesitant to switch.  The staff and Dr Paks have made us feel very comfortable and welcome.  They accommodated our schedule and worked us in for teeth cleaning.  The updates they have made to the office makes it more painless for the teeth xrays and I am able to see what they are discussing with me on the big screens.<//Text></record>

I have gone to this office for several years now. They are proactive in caring for my health. I love how they put things on “wait and see” instead of immediately doing a procedure that might not be necessary for a few years. This visit brought a new hygienist, and she was excellent. Great to see this office hire excellent employees when needed. I recommend this dental office without reservation.
Satisfied patient,

< Review>
I had found Dr. Pak in a last minute emergency situation. I had just chipped a large piece off my front tooth. In my panic I searched for a dentist that took my insurance plan. She was 1 of a couple of dentist near by but for what ever reason I was compelled to call her office. My panic grew as I had realized it was after 4pm and most offices close around 5. I called and told them what had happened I was put on hold for a minute. They told me I could come right in. Dr. Pak  squeezed me right before closing time, fixed my tooth and did an AMAZING job! It looks way better then it did before it broke. Now 6 months later you still can’t even tell that it was broken! All the staff are so friendly and welcoming.  They just make you feel so welcome and treat you as they have known you forever. I promise you won’t be disappointed!</Review>

<Review>Dr.Pak is such a great dentist. I absolutely loved Dr. Meglia, and was nervous about having him replaced and getting someone else. Dr.Pak is very kind and patient.  I see Dr. Meglia on occasion while (when he comes for some paperwork) which is an added bonus as well.</Review>< pictures>

Everyone involved is professional and affable.

Dr. Pak was such a refreshing change to my normal experience with the dentist. If you are looking for a new dentist or a change I can’t say enough good things. She was thorough, kind, gentle and I didn’t at any time feel like I was being pressured to do anything unnecessary (past experiences at the dentist made me apprehensive to go regularly) Dr. Pak is great at what she does.</Text>

<Text>Dr. Pak and her professional experts are providing my dental care efficiently, smoothly and painlessly.  I had been going to this practice since 2003 when Rob Meglia, DDS was the main man.  In his selection of Dr Pak to take over on his retirement, he chose wisely.  I'm in good hands with Dr Pak and her dental hygenist, Suzanne,  as well as the front receptionist.< /Text>< Name>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>VERY UPSET.  Dr. Pak took over for our beloved Dr. Meaglia, who we've been seeing for the past 8 years.  Their office called me 2 hours before my 4 children were due for their cleaning and told me that they would not see them unless they were all x-rayed.  I do not give in to medical bullying and told them that I would not submit my perfectly healthy children to un-necessary x-rays.  They hadn't even SEEN them.  I tried to tell them that I would have their orthodontist forward their x-rays and that only giving me 2 hours was extremely inconsiderate.  IN THE END, THESE PEOPLE WILL NEVER TOUCH MY CHILDREN.  Medicine is suppose to be consented and worked on as a team - not forced into potentially un-necessary procedures.  SHAME ON YOU, DR. PAK.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>
{'time': 1538435741339, 'text': "Hi Janine. Thank you for your feedback. Unfortunately, our front desk/office manager has had a family emergency last week and we have been working without her for several days. Our usual chart review was delayed, so we weren't able to give you more notice about your scheduled appointments. Apologies for that. Regarding dental x-rays, we are very cautious about patient exposure to radiation. We know about the negative effects of too much radiation; we are also well aware of what happens when dental disease goes undiagnosed - pain, infection, premature tooth loss. We understand that everyone has a right to choose what medical/dental procedures that they want to undergo. As dental professionals, we are governed by the Dental Board of California. Continuing to monitor patients without diagnostic x-rays for many years (as this is what has been happening) might be construed as neglect. As a side note, the radiographs that the orthodontist orders is great at showing the position of teeth and jaw structure, but these aren't diagnostic for determining cavities.\nWe are sure you will find a dentist that suits your needs better. Best of luck!"}</Resp>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>So happy with the service Sunblockers provided me!! Suzanne was always amazing to talk to and I'm grateful she gave me the best advice for the windows to keep them lasting a lifetime. So grateful for the lifetime warranty as long as I own the car. Inside is comfortable and nice to wait in. They also have $100 off right now! And their price is the out the door price. I highly suggest!</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqZXwe9qhiSAmgEBiXuBRzaF3g5tREiEJwBeys=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhOBbJJl8vOg0wsr0W0qabh2jDc_KhpwutX91O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><UserId.>114028988645926833174</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I had my windows tinted using Sunblockers. This was the second vehicle of mine they’ve done, and I’ve sent many coworkers/friends there. I love their work. I love the professionalism!  They get the job done in a very timely manner. The ONLY minor issue I had (and it may be more related to my OCD) was the leftover dried drips of whatever was used, during the installation process. I had to wipe off the sides of my car under all windows. They do great work otherwise!<//Review>

Plus the dogs are adorable too! They got me in sooner than originally scheduled, and had my vehicle ready to go on time as promised. Most of all, there have been no issues with the film application and they left the inside CLEAN! The price was fair and was the same as what I was quoted over the phone. I would highly recommend for the quality and warranty.</review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

They are very good about making an appointment time that fits your needs. They even  called and tried to get me in sooner when an opening came up but I wasn't able too.  They communicate very well about everything and make sure you get what your wanting.  Very knowledgeable about the products.  Good quality work..... takes time.  They do everything they can to be quick and I don't mind waiting for good quality work.  I've been back three times my side window were don't on my vehicle a couple years back and still there.... no issues no bubbles everything is great.  I broke out my rear window and had it replaced twice and had them tint it both times.  always good quality and matched the tint I already had on the sides.  I would recommend sun blockers to everyone that wants tinting done.  From what they say they warranty the labor, but the work is done right the first time and haven't had a need for it.<//Review>< Pictures>

My husband and I have been getting our car and truck windows tinted here for over 10 years. 8+ vehicles and always the same quality! Great customer service and great price! I have never had an issue,  has never bubbled or pealed. Always nice and dark and no streaks. Would never go anywhere else to get our Windows done!</review>

{'time': 1619035644428, 'text': "Hi Michelle, we searched our online quoting database for what was quoted to you, and we don't have anyone by the name of Michelle Youngness that we quoted. However, we are running a special, it is $100 off the full auto tint. Depending on the year, make & model, ie: most sedans would be $289, SUV's and Trucks are a little more. Please give us a call at 530-244-1995, so we can give you an accurate quote based on the year, make and model of your vehicle. Thank you!"}< /Response>

<Review>Not only have I had a few cars done but a few months back I had my office windows tinted. It is amazing how much cooler my office is. They did a great job! The owners were fantastic to work with and it helps that they are large breed dog owners!

Awesome job, they even gave us a ride to downtown.
Customer service skills at their best.
Everything scheduled was on time, even ahead of time, which was a benefit to us since we travel from out of town.

We have used sunblockers for three vehicles now. Wouldn’t dare go elsewhere. Excellent customer service, always a friendly voice on the other end of the phone. We actually waited for our vehicle this last time. My girls made themselves comfortable around the waiting area and enjoyed the dogs. As always beautiful work!</Text>

It was a farely quick process! Go in pick your tint and leave your vehicle for a few hours. They call when its finished! My car looks beautiful and Im so glad I chose Sunblockers! Will recommend for anyone in the future!</review>

They told me 30% or less was legal for your front windows. So I pay $250 for them to tint my windows. Within a week, I'm pulled over and have a ticket for not only my 2 front windows being too dark because IT'S ILLEGAL TO HAVE THEM TINTED,  but the front eyebrow they couldn't even do right. It's way to low and impedes on my vision. NOT TO MENTION the tinting is peeling off on the back window and flaps in the wind. The gentlemen i spoke to couldnt even say sorry. Instead he darts back with " you signed the paper". Yeah i was given false information! Save your time and money, shop elsewhere!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Very friendly, & professional. Had some tint put on my house windows. Had estimater come out first & he explained options in great detail. Along with that he gave some substantial discounts for the work to be done. They even gave another huge discount to come a day earlier than we agreed for install. Install went well. They were in & out in no time. Very clean job & courteous installers. Love the outcome that now we can watch tv on a sunny afternoon without the extreme blinding glare.< /Text>

<review>Not Professional at all.  Scam Artists for sure!  Their entire deal is all about talking bad about other shops in town.  And say how great they are, but from my experience with my car is that its all the same.  They say their product is far better than others so they try and charge more but it turns out Eclipse Tints has the same stuff at a far better deal.  I felt talked down to the whole time talking to them and them feeding me a giant pile of cow doo doo.<//review><Time>1397517582800<//Time><gmapID>0x54d2ec8a61973b91:0x352452f5d79d44d8</gmapID><Name>Jason Hill</Name></record>

We love it here. All of my family calls on this donut shop. My mother loves the old fashioneds and I love any of their croissant sweets. Sadly, someone wrote that the doughnuts tasted funny. This shop is known for the freshness of their baked goods. I’ve yet to buy something that is anything but delicious. This place also serves great drip coffee!</text>

<review>Last oil change I went to the place down the street. They charged for everything they possibly could!

So I tried here, and was thrilled with the exceptional customer service. They explained everything, added nothing, and were just wonderful to a one!

I’d like to highlight Michael, who performed my services. I’ll be referring everyone, and only going to Jiffy Lube from now on.

I’m an old woman. Everyone tries to rip me off. Not here!< /review>< Pics>

< Review>
I only use Jiffy Lube. The Lodi store people are always pleasant and they complete my oil change in a timely manor. They do not try and push me to buy extras or pressure me to get other services done. They only ask me if I want an extra service if the computer alerts them which I appreciate.
My only complaint would be there has been times that I’ve been there and the check point list on the receipt has things checked off that clearly they didn’t do or they didn’t check, but it doesn’t happen too often. I recommend jiffy lube and I will continue to use them.< /Review>

The service was quick and efficient. Came to this particular Jiffy Lube because of the other good reviews, and thought I’d add my own review to say that they are as good as the other reviewers say. Will recommend this location to others and will continue to come here myself. Thank you Michael, and thank you Jiffy Lube.< /text>< Pictures>

The attention to detail has really gone down. They no longer vacuum. My windows had streaks. They no longer show you the oil level. The prices have gone up for lack luster service and slow techs. The tech adding oil kept sticking the dipstick under his arm pit to clean it off vs using a rag. Very very very unprofessional.<//Text>

I needed to have my radiator flushed after the wrong product was used to top up my coolant. I visited this location to have it flushed and to get my usual oil change. The staff there is always prompt and welcoming and I was all done within 25 mins. Great service and the cost was better than I anticipated. I will be back for my next oil change.</Text>

<text>Fantastic Service! I stopped by yesterday in need of getting an  oil change for my car. Before I could even get out of my car Mike was there to greet me and welcome me to the business. It was a super easy process, as a brand new customer and Mike explained every part of the process as well honest with me for an expected time frame. I am fairly certain it took no more than 30 minutes for it to be completed. Every employee I spoke to were pleasant and greeted me as well as wished me a great day. Highly recommended!< /text>< pictures>

I was helped by Vantha this morning and not only was he professional but he was able to answer all of my questions and give great advice back. I was able to get back on the road to work in excellent time and customer service. The crew that was on this morning with him seemed to have a great working chemistry and efficiency. I'm pretty sure he is a manager but if not I sure hope the company knows what a great leader they have among their workforce.<//text>

They had great people working here, but something happened. They transferred a lot of people. I’ve had 3 terrible experiences in a row. The final straw was a tire rotation but they forgot to tighten my lug nuts on rear passenger side. I was driving with a horribly loose tire. Pulled over, jacked up my car and tightened it myself. The past year quality just terrible. Will be looking elsewhere.< /review>

<text>I cannot say enough good things about the wonderful people that work at Jiffy Lube. The reasons for my past few visits is because my tires have been low. So I visit Jiffy Lube and fill my tires (including the spare) so the sensor light will go off....FREE OF CHARGE!!
And I don't have to wait in line. The longest I have waited for them to air my tires has been maybe 5 minutes. Thank you Jiffy Lube!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<text>Great place for oil change and tire rotation. Yes they are a little pricey. But friendly staff that keeps you informed if something happens or your not aware of. I would say its about 45-60 min wait for tire rotation and oil change together. But for a Oil change it's most likely about 30-45 mins.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1573079660749, 'text': 'Thanks for the nice review Rebz, we appreciate your business and value the feedback on your oil change and tire rotation services.

Greated me instantly when they scanned my license plate.
States my name and informed me that they were practicing social distancing and respected my space and me coming ro visit.
They noticed my left headlight was out and offered to replace it which was really nice.
Overall, excellent service great team and you shod be proud to have thise employees.
See you next time.

Very courteous staff. I usually just change my own oil, but was busy and took it here instead. When I walked in, the customer rep yelled out (something like) "New Customer" and all employees cheered. That was pretty cool.
All these type of "lube shops" always have suggestions beyond the standard oil change but the couple of times I've gone to a lube shop previously, they almost make you feel bad for not buying their recommendations. Not here. The staff was very honest about their suggestions. I decided to follow up with my mechanic just to be safe and he agreed with most of their recommendations.

I was in and out in like 25-30 minutes. They had a nice waiting area for a mechanic-type shop. I'll probably continue to change my oil most of the time, but for that once every couple years that I don't, this Jiffy Lube ddid an awesome job!</Review>

I have mixed feelings about Jiffy Lube in general, but this branch is really quite great. They were efficient, polite, professional, and clean. If I lived in the area this would be the place for me to change my oil. I am sometimes put off by the pushiness of the folks trying to sell you extras at Jiffy Lube, but the young man at this branch was very courteous in his approach and advise. My brother in law lives near by and I will go back when I come to visit.</text>

<Review>We just had our oil and filters changed here. The customer service was OUTSTANDING. Had a little growl in the car when we pulled away and came back. The young lady who helped us was so pleasant and efficient!!  The cabin ac filter had not seated correctly. She replaced and that's all it took!!  Hard to find people who care anymore, what a refreshing experience< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

My mother has been going to this location for awhile and doesnt pay much attention to take care of cae things.  We took her car in to have the oil changed because she thought it was time and they were so honest and nice letting her know she has plenty in time before shw needs to change it.  They still checked and topped it off at no charge.  I love the honesty and feel great sending her here.  Great job!!< /Text>

Lodi is the best, I tried Yuba City on a Saturday and was told I had a "speciality vehicle" and would have to come back during the week. It's a Dodge ram truck, I suspect because it was an hour before closing they didn't want to deal with it.</Review>

<Review>Love,love,love this place. I’ve come here multiple times because she does a fabulous job threading my brows, it’s hard to find somewhere that does it perfect, she does a really good job. The customer service is really great, she is really friendly. The timing is quick, I’m in and out. I definitely recommend coming here for bomb brows🤩 This is my go to place✨< /Review>< time>

<Review>I was having a horrible day and I wandered into Fabulous Threading to get some "self care" and I am so glad I did. Not only was I greeted with a smile but the atmosphere given off by the technician was pleasant and peaceful. I feel as if Ive made a new friend. The technician that did my eyebrows, lip and chin was so completely sweet and professional all at the same time! I learned upon leaving that her name is Raj. I want to say thank you to Raj for making my day better. You certainly have a beautiful soul!<//Review>< pictures>

<review>My partner, Edna Straub, has been wearing hearing aids provided by Connect Hearing for six years. She wears them daily, and she loves them. Her hearing is terrific.  Edna has worn them everywhere, even for her bowling league, in the house, watching TV, and when I take her to the beach.

They fit perfectly, and she takes them out when she goes to bed, puts them in the charger until morning, and they are ready to keep her hearing well all through the day and evening. I'm writing this for her, because she has a problem with dementia. Edna is grateful for Eric and Rosie, who are caring and thoughtful. I recommend Connect Hearing.  They have been a vital part of her life.< /review>< Pics>

< Review>
Rosie and Eric at Connect Hearing Garden Grove have been the perfect combination of professional and personal. They have helped my brother Robert during this horrendously challenging year of his life. My brother hears better now than he has his entire adult life. I highly recommend this office.</Review>

Great place, plenty of parking, efficient and friendly office Eric knows his stuff and answered all my questions. He even set up my phone to link with my hearing aids. What more can you ask for? Thanks< /review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Review>I took my Mom who is 94 yrs to have her hearing aids checked. Rosie and Eric treated her as if she was family. My mom needed assistance to the restroom before her appointment Rosie took care of her and helped her. My mom is handicap and Rosie was very helpful. Eric took the time to make sure my mom was provided with a new pair of hearing aids. He found a new set that would be best in cost and a good fit for her ears. My mom loved the care she received. She is very happy. My mom was so happy she left a painting she made for this office.</Review>< Response>

<Review>Connect Hearing in Garden Grove is wonderful! ERIC has been so very kind, patient, and thoughtful with my mom every time we visit. She had actually purchased hearing aids at a big box store first, and was disappointed with the advice and service she received there . Finding Eric & Connect Hearing was a really lucky thing! He provided a very thorough exam, explained the results with kindness and care, and then offered a few options for my mom to choose from. His staff helped process the Insurance paperwork, and the follow up and maintenance has been a breeze. If you or someone you know is having a tough time coming to terms with hearing loss, go see Eric - you will be glad you did!<//Review>< date>

<Text>Thank you again to Rosie and Eric!
I’m so impressed with the amazing customer service my mother and I received.
With my mother being older she requires so much attention and patience. These days it’s hard to find hard working people who actually care!
I recommend this place 10/10!!<//Text>< gmap_id>

Both Dr Eric and Rosie were very helpful and friendly it made our experience delightful. The hearing aids they provided have changed our lives for the better. The Bluetooth capability has been a miracle for us. My wife now can hear our TV at a low setting and now she has gotten back her ability to heat all the background talk. She hears accents and music with great clarity and a lost accuracy. Thanks guys.< /review>

<Review>Our experience with Eric and Rosie at Connect Hearing Garden Grove was exceptional! We came in to get replacement hearing aids for my grandma and I couldn’t be happier with the service. Eric treated my 92 year old grandmother with the utmost respect and came up with a great pair of hearing aids that were perfect for her. He explained every step of the process with her and even spent over an hour with her  calibrating the hearing aids to her, showing her how to use them and helping her with the best way to put them on given her arthritis, something that her previous hearing aid providers did not do! I would recommend Eric and Rosie at Connect to anyone and so will my grandma!< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>Exceptional experience.  Eric is really good at explaining things in terms that a layman can understand.  He and Rosie clearly have the well being of the client first.  I came out with a terrific set of hearing aids at a price I could easily manage.  I did not know how excellent and affordable these digital hearing aids had become.  I was by no means deaf, just mid range hearing loss.  But the correction to my hearing has been a game changer.  Only wished I had gone in years earlier.  Can you even notice I have them on?<//Text>< UserId.>

My experience from my walk-in discussion with Rosie to my follow up meeting and exam with Eric was outstanding.  Both are caring and very helpful.  All questions were answered and the hearing aids I got are fantastic.  A whole world of hearing, conversing, and participating in life has been restored.  Great follow up service as well.</Text>

I brought my mother in law into Connect Hearing, Eric is so knowledgeable about the hearing aides and he explained and answered all of the questions that my mother in law asked him. Eric and Rosie make the Patient feel very comfortable, They provide excellent customer service, if I could  give them a higher rating, I would.
I will definitely refer Connect Hearing, Garden Grove  To anyone that has a need for hearing aides.< /Review>

My partner, Edna Straub, has been wearing hearing aids provided by Connect Hearing for six years. She wears them daily, and she loves them. Her hearing is terrific.  Edna has worn them everywhere, even for her bowling league, in the house, watching TV, and when I take her to the beach.

They fit perfectly, and she takes them out when she goes to bed, puts them in the charger until morning, and they are ready to keep her hearing well all through the day and evening. I'm writing this for her, because she has a problem with dementia. Edna is grateful for Eric and Rosie, who are caring and thoughtful. I recommend Connect Hearing.  They have been a vital part of her life.< /Review>

<Text>Rosie and Eric at Connect Hearing Garden Grove have been the perfect combination of professional and personal. They have helped my brother Robert during this horrendously challenging year of his life. My brother hears better now than he has his entire adult life. I highly recommend this office.</Text>< Date>

Eric did a very thorough exam with my mother as well as he was patient with her and Rosie did amazing when she explained the insurance part made it easy to understand. I have never had to go through a process like this and Rosie couldnt have made it any more enjoyable. Thank you so much for all your time, patience, and exceptional guest service!

<Text>I took my Mom who is 94 yrs to have her hearing aids checked. Rosie and Eric treated her as if she was family. My mom needed assistance to the restroom before her appointment Rosie took care of her and helped her. My mom is handicap and Rosie was very helpful. Eric took the time to make sure my mom was provided with a new pair of hearing aids. He found a new set that would be best in cost and a good fit for her ears. My mom loved the care she received. She is very happy. My mom was so happy she left a painting she made for this office.< /Text><user_id>102676744252553786957<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

Connect Hearing in Garden Grove is wonderful! ERIC has been so very kind, patient, and thoughtful with my mom every time we visit. She had actually purchased hearing aids at a big box store first, and was disappointed with the advice and service she received there . Finding Eric & Connect Hearing was a really lucky thing! He provided a very thorough exam, explained the results with kindness and care, and then offered a few options for my mom to choose from. His staff helped process the Insurance paperwork, and the follow up and maintenance has been a breeze. If you or someone you know is having a tough time coming to terms with hearing loss, go see Eric - you will be glad you did!< /text>

Both Dr Eric and Rosie were very helpful and friendly it made our experience delightful. The hearing aids they provided have changed our lives for the better. The Bluetooth capability has been a miracle for us. My wife now can hear our TV at a low setting and now she has gotten back her ability to heat all the background talk. She hears accents and music with great clarity and a lost accuracy. Thanks guys.</review>

Our experience with Eric and Rosie at Connect Hearing Garden Grove was exceptional! We came in to get replacement hearing aids for my grandma and I couldn’t be happier with the service. Eric treated my 92 year old grandmother with the utmost respect and came up with a great pair of hearing aids that were perfect for her. He explained every step of the process with her and even spent over an hour with her  calibrating the hearing aids to her, showing her how to use them and helping her with the best way to put them on given her arthritis, something that her previous hearing aid providers did not do! I would recommend Eric and Rosie at Connect to anyone and so will my grandma!< /text>

Exceptional experience.  Eric is really good at explaining things in terms that a layman can understand.  He and Rosie clearly have the well being of the client first.  I came out with a terrific set of hearing aids at a price I could easily manage.  I did not know how excellent and affordable these digital hearing aids had become.  I was by no means deaf, just mid range hearing loss.  But the correction to my hearing has been a game changer.  Only wished I had gone in years earlier.  Can you even notice I have them on?<//Review>

<text>My experience from my walk-in discussion with Rosie to my follow up meeting and exam with Eric was outstanding.  Both are caring and very helpful.  All questions were answered and the hearing aids I got are fantastic.  A whole world of hearing, conversing, and participating in life has been restored.  Great follow up service as well.< /text>< gmapID>

Came here to get my hearing evaluation and I could not been more happier to come to Connect Hearing. Rosie and Eric are very friendly and made me feel welcomed. I also felt comfortable to ask questions with both of them and they were very helpful. I will definitely be referring my friends and family to their office.</review>

<review>Descent collection of fresh Asian veggies. We live in Ukiah, so having access to an Asian grocery store is nice. They have a nice collection of Vietnamese groceries.

The coconut milk and cream is reasonably priced at 1 dollarish a piece.<//review>< pics>

<Review>I'm impressed with how the products are so clean and well organized here you may not find stuff rare Asian ethnic ingredients you areooking for here because they seem to have such tiny space but overall they carrying pretty basic items you need for  daily basis cooking. One thing I found quite annoying was none price labeled on most items. Pretty skeptical.<//Review><user_name>Apple “Apple Pyro” Imperato< /user_name></record>

The service is great but there’s usually a wait because there’s only one cashier.  I’m always getting the spicy noodles there and I always leave with more than intended.< /Text>

Too expensive and there was many expired products. Plus they used expired shrimp to cook then sell it as ‘cooked shrimp ‘ which is nasty.
Long wait and only one cashier but no room to stand.<//text>

< Review>
This is one of my favorite local shops! The owners are a kind couple, and they're always super welcoming to me and my son. They fry fresh fish, cut up huge jackfruits, and stock lots of chinese and other asian vegetables that my family loves. I will admit that some of the of their items are overpriced, but I'd rather support a local business than order a single ingredient online to get ship a million miles and get to me in a month. Also, many goods they have are usually hard to find in any other store, and I love being able to find them right across the street.</Review>

They sold expired foods. I went there in July to get Kimchi and their Kimchi was expired in October 2017. And when I told the owner that I want to exchange, she told me to grab a new one. I grabbed the more expansive Kimchi because they only have two kinds the new one I got and the Expired Kimchi; She said I had to pay more and she didn’t allow me to use credit card to pay if it’s under 10. So I had to go around to pick some more stuff to fill up to $10 to only get the UNEXPIRED KIMCHI. Horrible service!! It is not my fault that I bought their expired food and what I get back is PAYING MORE. Rediculous! There is no customer service at all.

They use raw shrimp that is going to expire to cook it then sell it as ‘cooked shrimp’ to get some cash from foods that is going to expire!!! So be careful of those cooked shrimps.
Things are pricey there too. I only go there when I really need stuff to buy from them.

She always asked about my private details too like How much money I make at work ? bla bla... !!??? How much my husband make?

Also she gave other lady many bags but she only packed my everything in only 1 bag and the food was upside-down and fell everywhere in the bag. What is going on with her?<//text>

This post office is no longer a secret. Located in Macy’s on the lower level. Friendly Service and a small selection of packing material are available. Closed on Sundays.<//Review>

Hard to find initially but once you know where it is then it is fine. Has a distinct odor like it has been flooded.

There is a small selection of packing materials for purchase and the standard drop off slots you are accustomed to.

If there was any location that should stay open later it is this one, but sadly it does not. Several times I have tried coming here only to find a sign telling me it was closed and it had been in the middle of the day. Not sure why.

They were closed for a long time ostensibly for a remodel, but no noticeable change was made. No post office is kept up to date by any means and this one is no different. It isn't dirty, but it is a noticeable clash from coming right from Macy's. Granted, subjective in a way, but it is depressing going to any post office because of their choice of atmosphere it seems.

When I have been able to catch this one open I've been able to reliably complete my transactions. They seem to have knowledgeable staff that can process a line fairly quickly.

Conclusion being... Update this location and fix the odor issue. Not sure how Macy's welcomes the clash in decor. This location has great people and they should be rewarded with a better workplace.<//Review>

Agreed with the others here. Short queues. Super helpful and friendly staff. Actually v easy to find: on basement level of Macy’s look just to the right of the San Francisco Tourism counter. You’ll see a post office sign above. Just go to the right.<//review>

Hard to find, but full-service post office with 3-4 clerks.  Very friendly and efficient.  Enter Macy's (the main store, not the men's store) from Stockton, turn left through cosmetics, take the down escalator; turn right through Faberware (note picture).  Door is practically invisible.  Macy's clerks are helpful.</text>

This is the best USPS I've been to.
Maybe because it is well hidden in Macy's basement, but once you've foudnd your way to the cellar, any staff member will show you the way.</Review>

<Review>As the other reviewers have stated, it is there. Find the Sunglass Hut in the women's store, look for the escalator opposite it and proceed down. Once on the bottom floor turn right off the escalator and right again to proceed directly behind it: the Post Office sign will be in front of you.

Even near lunchtime on tax day the line wasn't too long, though be aware they sell almost no envelopes, etc.<//Review>< pics>

This place is totally hidden, but its in the basement in the corner. There are a few sign posts to help you find it but they're hard to spot so i'd just ask for directions from the staff.<//Review>

< Review>
This was a great Post Office.Like I said was....it’s closing February 28th 2019.Why?Couldn’t find out other than they “couldn’t renew their lease” which probably means the rent was raised so high even the U.S. government said NO!</Review>

(Translated by Google) I went to Macy's many times and didn't know there was a post office in the basement.
Certainly it is in an incomprehensible place.
So I was able to proceed smoothly without a long line.
Are the people at the counter more kind than the post offices elsewhere? I felt like that.

(Original)
何度もメーシーズに行ってるのにポストオフィスが地下にあるなんて全然知りませんでした。
確かにわかりずらい場所にあります。
なので長い列もなくスムーズに手続きできました。
カウンターの係の人達も他所のポストオフィスより多少なり親切な様な？気がしましたよ。</Text>

<Name>Wolffang<//Name><Review>honestly.... the only reason this is two stars is because you can drop your amazon returns here. SCAN and GO. Other than that, if you have any other business here your better off going somewhere else. Going here they make you feel like a criminal for even having a slight inconvenience.  Just do yourself a favor and drive a couple minutes to somewhere else so you don't feel violated.  ( I would recommend Postal Center on Pacific they treated me so good)< /Review><rating>2< /rating><user>102350308472201400158< /user>< Pics>

Take your business to the UPS store at 6507 Pacific Ave Stockton, CA 95207 instead. The brown haired lady working at this location was one of the rudest customer services employees I have ever come across in my life. She seemed to hate her job and hate people. She rolled her eyes and scoffed at my basic questions about their services and my package. Left the store feeling terrible for doing absolutely nothing wrong. The other location was far more pleasant.</Text>

Google show their opening hour at 8am weekly.. Turn out when I call the reps she mention they always open at 10am. They need to update their hours on Google so it won't waste time and gas like I did driving and waiting for them to open their business to us.</Text>

<review>Karen is very very very rude ! Extremely rude ! She needs to get retired from work and sit at home... every time I go there she is very rude to every customer. I was there with my 9 months old daughter in my arms and Karen was not ready to help.. I had to do everything with my one hand while in other arm I was holding my daughter ... worst scenario is this is the only UPS near my house.. !</review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

This store is horrible. There was horrible customer service, The older caucasian lady working was being rude to everyone in front of me and when it was my turn she wanted to have a smart mouth. She deserves to be fired because you guys just lost a customer. & from reading the other reviews i’m not the only one.<//Review>

<text>I did business with this place about 5 years ago. A good experience. Got my document notarized and shipped with a smile. I've been in there 2 times in the last 6 months and it's a semi humiliating experience. The 2nd visit, i was "helped" by a mid aged lady. I was returning AT&T equipment. Once she knew what i was trying to do, her attitude became really apparent. She rolled her eyes. Last weekend, the older lady.... well she's just rude. They definitely make you feel like you're bothering them. I'm sorry you hate your job!< /text>< userid>

If you're looking to be treated well, if you're expecting helpful, professional, courteous employees .... If you're expecting excellent customer service .... If you have an item & the label MUST be scanned by end of business close, Today (5pm) & you realize you left label on your desk at home & the clock on the UPS STORE wall reads 4:46pm so you'll need the store's email address that now includes forgotten label for reprint.

Checking your watch it's currently 4:59pm and not only was your item scanned by end of business as needed but as you're starting your vehicle you happen to glance at the UPS STORE window & smile easily & wave a quick good bye to the gentleman you see standing just inside the door from which you just departed .... You roll down your window & not only wave back, but also mouth another well deserved "THANK YOU" to James for his, as always, amazingly & sometimes startling professionalism, courtesy & above all else kindness and patience he shows me every visit, without judgement of my situation ... Only true concern & caring to whether, before I depart thru those doors heading home, all my needs and/or questions I arrived with have been addressed & processed per my request !

IF YOU'RE LOOKING PPL FOR THE SAME QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE DESCRIBED, IN ADDITION TO THE AMAZING SUPPORT YOU'LL IMMEDIATELY RECEIVE ... You'll find everything you need at the Manteca  UPS STORE on Main Street in Manteca CA & SO MUCH MORE !    THIS STORE ROCKS !!<//Review>

<Review>Question. How many times does an employee get complaints about her poor customer service until someone owner management does something about it. I've had to return some items but the 2 times I've had to be there, the lady is rude. Have to wait in a line for awhile then Im next and shes tending to others and i still have to wait.<//Review>< pictures>

This place is a little dive with such charm.  Good tasty food.  Don't go looking for valet service or some top chef stuff.   It's basic but good and very flavorful.  Takes cash only. And of lot of good hard working people run the place.  I always enjoy this spot.  If I am on that side of town I always stop by.</Review>

<Text>For cash only, if you are in the area Teddy’s is hard to beat for the price, quantity, and taste!  Nothing fancy - simple and tasty with good service. Beware it does get busy in the mornings but somehow my coffee mug was always full! Great breakfast options - we ended up going 2 mornings and would have gone again if we weren’t passing thru.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQpPpJ2u2fPkfjB1s4FllGREc5IiS-ZaQq2CVb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTf5MamlcpjTl-O1NHpNkubW52sxNe4NK3FEnd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNh9gulnSTic07SIbxyEdQKAoO5psqQ44SX6CRm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOPiSYaJ8VflgdgkIMeTjYPmd6CVLDgVzRx2MO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVt6botLnP2YfRgK1eXUZmWBC1HQtqMRCVEc6q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoGSzGlRsds6L16WJTGXMERX0WoRpRlVYkMfh6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOei-svP7BMSGTOqd0U_FVNMpWls4kd9WTCL8CP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c2bb0e39dc8f97:0xd2ef01003322c92e<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

For starters, the parking sucks. The parking lot is too small. There was a line that was out the door.  The wait was about 5-10minute.  And its a cash only establishment.

The coffee was good, but the breakfast was average.

The scrambled eggs were nice and fluffy but the sausages were beyond salty.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJUWcejqNr4cizpweSZGz8rzzBV-j0kWwGKgMD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>Very old school diner feel— which was much appreciated. The food reflected that, reliable, salty, nothing unexpected. Cash only is a downer, but otherwise solid, felt like a east coast family owned diner in the middle of LA. Breakfast sandwich, potatoes, and pancakes were all a hit.< /Text><user_name>Charlie & Anna</user_name></record>

Always make it a point to dine here when traveling down to LA. It's usually the first stop for a hearty breakgast and we always feel welcomed here by the friendly staff. Even when the breakfast crowd is there, our food usually arrives at our table so fast and hot. So far everything I've ordered is all so satisfying and I always look forward to going back.< /text>

Got the beef hash, it had good taste. I really enjoy the potatoes. The coffee is average. There was a very sick worker, blowing her nose all over the place. They should have sent her home especially at a food place.  Other than that everything was great.</review>

Service is good. Mixed feelings on the food though. Sausage size is incredibly small and pancakes have an off flavor. Eggs cooked fine and toast is good. Definitely not a great experience but worth coming back to try a different menu item

Update: 2 weeks after my initial review I came back and tried a different dish. Got the corned beef hash. Unfortunately my experience led me to knock off a star from my original review.

Corned beef way too oily. Potatoes had a mushy texture. Egg had some weird off taste to it. Sourdough bread was ok.

Really wanted to like this place but unfortunately it is over hyped.<//Review>

Everything you'd expect from a great little neighborhood diner.  Everything is a good value.  Burgers that are remarkably great for the price.  Excellent breakfast.
The chicken fried steak is the best I've had in Los Angeles.</Text>

The home cooking and the personalized service make you forget you are living in a large city, it feels like you are dining with friends. I will definitely be back.

This place gets busy. Parking lot gets full quick. And you can only pay with cash. I had a spanish omelet with salsa on top which was pretty good.. And some potatoes on the side and a fresh orange juice. I might go back, only if there is parking.<//review>

Good food and great prices. This place is a reliable coffee shop option. Maybe not as good as some other places, but the staff is really nice and the prices can't be beat. I like the club sandwich and the breakfasts. Warning: it is cash only, but they do have an ATM.<//Review>

So glad we decided to go somewhere local instead of to a chain. We were only in town for a few days and the full parking lot suggested this place would be a hit. Everything on the menu was absolutely amazing. Great service. Loved the pancakes and the steak and eggs. Highly recommend!<//review>

True greasy spoon that somehow maintains prices that are a blast from the past.

Food is quite decent, decor is era-appropriate, parking lot is just adequate.

Not enough to get excited about aside from the price, but if you’re already in the area, it’s worth a stop, at least for breakfast.<//Review>

<Review>Breakfast at home. Gone my whole life. I really come back for the atmosphere, service and the best PANCAKES! Julio the bus boy is friendly and funny. Maria and teddy the owners are so welcoming and genuine. Chava is a great water that always puts a smile on our faces. Angelica is a very sweet and warm waitress. Food is made to order, comforting, consistent and just what you'd expect at a diner with a few Mexican dishes available. Love their steak and eggs. Nomadie breakfast, omelets and so much more.<//Review><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c2bb0e39dc8f97:0xd2ef01003322c92e</gmapID><user_name>J m</user_name><Rating>5</Rating><pictures>None</pictures><date>1569949663044<//date></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I've been coming here for a few years and feel very comfortable here. Its basically a diner and has daily specials. The service for me has been great prices are very reasonable Fish and Chips on Friday is my favorite. A lot of model cars decorate the walls the owner is a classic car guy so you may see his 65 or 57 Chevy in the lot on a nice day. Thursday is their car night so you may run into other car guys.</Review></record></dataset><record>

This place is a great little old school diner with some cheap eats. From the two times I've dropped in for breakfast, none of the food particularly blew me away, but I wasn't disappointed either because of the value and convenience. For breakfast I'd stick to the specials with boxes around them on the menu to get the most bang for your buck.< /text>

<Review>On a trip back home a few years ago we missed a turn off for one of our favorite breakfast spots, turned into this parking lot to turn around and never left.  Parking lot was packed and we figured that there had to be a reason.  WE WERE RIGHT!  Wonderful food, great ambiance and hot coffee.  Only complaint?  Not enough parking.  Okay - we can adapt as this place delivers in taste, value & speed of service!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Classic diner and a great deal. Well prepared food served by a friendly and attentive crew. The menu has something for everyone, with the emphasis on hamburgers, sandwiches and breakfast. I had the Westside special, 2 eggs cooked to order, two sausage (bacon is an option), and 2 pancakes (or toast). Good breakfast! Seating is comfortable and plentiful.< /text>

My family and I ended up at Teddy's, before our flight, for an early dinner. Rae's was closing so they recommended Teddy's because they are both owned by the same person. The food was great and the price was right. I had the veggies omelet and my wife has a veggie club sandwich. Plus they have cold beer. Everyone gave it a thumbs up. Plus, they were very kind to my two slightly autistic children.</review>

Girlfriend had never been to Teddy's, so we decided to go, instead of one of our more usual places.  In her words, it was "one of the best tuna melts" she'd had and I had a ham steak breakfast.  Good honest food, at a great price.</text>

I love this place.  Diners like these are unfortunately becoming more and more scarce.  I get two delicious eggs, bacon, hash browns and 3 pancakes for $6.   The oatmeal is delicious.  All the lunches and dinners I've had are right where they should be.  It's not the Palms or Prime, but it's not supposed to be.  May they never close!<//Text>

I love this place! I've been coming here since I was 13 and is one of my favorites. I recently became vegan and they helped me fix a meal completely vegan with sautéed veggies and and avocado sandwich. Their waiters are very nice and they provide excellent costumer service.</text>

With all of the development in WLA, I'm surprised that this place still exists. Old school diner complete with appropriate fare, decor (imagine 1960 Mayberry but with latino servers) and prices!  My keto meal (eggs & hamburger steak) was cooked to perfection and served graciously. Based on overheard banter and casual observation, the patronage was mostly AARP set and locals. The wait staff was attentive without being bothersome. My mechanic moved nearby, so I'll be back.<//Text>

Great food, prices great, service great, etc.   They need a different recipe for their Peach pie.   Otherwise,  better than my cooking !!< /Text>

Pretty solid local breakfast joint -- can't believe I never tried it during all of the years I lived right up the street! I tried the corned beef hash, which came out in an interesting circular patty shape with a slice of pineapple too. It tasted good though, so that's all that matters. I liked the tiny cubes of potato for maximum distribution. I also had a side of biscuits and gravy, which was also very decent. Coffee was typical diner coffee, and service at the bar was fast and friendly.

tldr; it's a diner :-)< /text>

Good fashioned coffee shop-diner with very reasonable prices. Parking lot is limited, as is seating, and it's a popular local place with good food and service.

I walked into Teddy's Cafe many years ago on the 2nd day of his operation.  Religiously I have not stopped eating there in over 24+ years.  I don't know if anything else needs to be said.  The food is tasty, the service is very good and the atmosphere is perfect for those simple, inexpensive great breakfasts or lunches!  I'm a much older man now and my 2 little boys love coming to Teddy's.  They can't get enough of the pancakes!  This place in a West LA icon and one must really experience it to know that these great places still exist and strive.   Have the biscuits and gravy!  You tell Teddy "Mugsy" sent ya.</Text>

What you see is what you get: good old fashioned cafe with good honest food, with a little mexican flavor courtesy of Guadalajara born Teddy.  Very warm and friendly atmosphere--waitresses and customers are often on a first name basis.</review>

This place is terrible food is nasty they don't take debit card. They put a slice of cheese on my eggs. The food is just nasty I should've walked out. Wish you can put negative that's why it's a lot of people there cause there taste buds are gone<//Review>
