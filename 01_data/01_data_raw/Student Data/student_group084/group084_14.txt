If you enjoy being overcharged and being told your car still needs another couple of weeks if everything goes well every couple of weeks that you ask, then come on in! You’ll love it here.

I’d sooner ask my 8-year-old sister to do my car repairs than come back here again.<//review>

Staff were friendly and really helpful. I did a cash job at a reasonable price compared to other locations and my vehicle was left just like new! 🙌🏽 they even gave it a quick clean before handing it over to me. My experience was great and have no complaints! Thank you for repairing my vehicle!< /Text>

Once they secure your business they are very nice  by the next day they don't even want to take your call. My vehicle was there for 3months and they did a really bad job . My vehicle is making some weird noise. But when it comes to charging you  they are the best.<//text>

We stage accidents and then we bring them to them and they double charge the insurance company and it's ran by a Japanese man named hero hoshimura and we don't get along so I'm telling everything they are fraudulent don't take your car there they're going to run so many liens on there you wouldn't know what to do and it's all legal Inglewood California</Review>

<Text>Nice front desk clerk asked me if I wanted water while I waited. They were really fast at getting to my car. Helped me get a rental car that's near by. Answered all my questions and got my insurance company out the next day. Had my car fixed in a week in a half and they said it would be 2 weeks. And it was washed and waxed when I got it back and the work was great you can't even tell I had damage. I had a great experience and I will definitely go back.<//Text>< name>

This is my first time doing a review but I suggest that you do business with these people at your own risk. They charge me over 3,000 for their services and all they did was give me a rental for 3 days and keep my car hostage so they could rack up the holding fees.</Review>

I experienced GREAT service!! I had some front and back bumper damage to my 2003 ES300 Lexus and they repaired quickly for a GREAT price! Looked just like new!  I now drive a 2015 C300 and as luck would have it, I was rear ended again! I am on my way to receive an estimate. Ask for the manager, Hero.

Update: I don't know why, but I KEEP getting hit! My 2015 C300 Mercedes has been hit FIVE times!! Never my fault! Each time I take to Airport Collision to have repaired and my car is returned to me looking brand new!! Someone hit my mirror while I was sitting at a stop light. I'm going to have Airport Collision repair because I know I will receive great service. :-)< /Review>

AVOID THIS PLACE. They charge fees you can’t pay and end up just taking your car. They say “you won’t have to pay anything” but if the insurance doesn’t cover it then they keep your car. This place is very shady. AVOID AVOID AVOID.<//Review>

<Text>I guess those 5 stars are from ppl who work for this company or know someone who does. This company and their associated tow company are money hungry. The company harrassed me when I wanted to remove my car from them. They've had my car over two months and I've had to call for updates. Lies after lies come from the receptionists. They have attitudes when you call.

If you do choose to deal with them, I suggest you go check on your vehicle regularly, in person.< /Text>< name>

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.

DO NOT LET THE TOW TRUCK TRICK YOU INTO TAKING IT HERE.  THE REVIEWS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES.

this is a very shady shop. They keep dodging your calls in order to keep charging storage and other fees
They're very condescending and unprofessional and this is putting it nicely.< /Review>

This place has very poor customer service.  I've recently paid full the full price of 216.00 (6/23/17) to have my driver side mirror repaired.  They said it would be repaired the same day.  It is now Tuesday, I have called several times and there has been no progress on my simple repair.  I would highly suggest another shop in the area.  Very disappointed with this shop.  The repairs would have been done if I went with another trustworthy shop.  BEWARE!</Text>

<text>I'm never the type to be this dissatisfied but I'm for sure not holding back this time! The girls at the front desk are liars and the owner avoids dealing with customers firsthand ! It's like why are y'all in business if y'all not here to satisfy the customer! The girl lied and said she called me which I know she didn't only to check my phone records no calls and they'll weasle their way out of being responsible for anything by telling you they'll call back.They swear the owner is never there when his daughter be right there answering the phone like why are y'all playing with people's money! I've taken some losses but this is one I'm not letting happen! The work itself was crappy and I'm most positive that they faked ordering parts cuz my daughter left a distinct mark on something they said they replaced, and they lie about that too I'm for sure filing a claim against them in time they will do business the right way cause I'm the wrong one to play with about my money!</text><name>danielle hunter<//name><response>None<//response><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THIS PLACE!!
My car has been in their care for 6 days after lying and having a person misrepresent himself as their employee, who assured me at the scene of the accident that I could get my care repaired and obtain a loaner car at the same time.  Nothing that they said was true and now they have inflated the bill and they are holding my car hostage.  It was placed in storage upon receipt and was NEVER taken to the lot for repair, but placed in storage, in an area the indicates that that section is for cars beyond repair.  I will call the police and will sue them it that becomes necessary.</review>

< review>
this place promised me that they would take care of everything  and almost right from the start the nightmare began. Like a week or two after the accident ; yes they gave me a rental which i regret accepting now ill tell you why in a bit. Anyway so the lawyer handling my case kept asking me whats going on with the shop that had the car and i would ask the people from airport they told me not to worry that the lady's insurance that hit me would take care of the storage fees and the rental car they provided so i continued living my life then a month after the accident airport calls me asking me whats going on with the storage bill that they need to be paid for it, so i ask ok how much is it they tell me its almost 8,000 dollars i almost dropped to the floor i said how did it get so high in just a month they made up all these fees like 2,000 for towing the 700 for the rental which was only 400 and like 160 bucks per day for storage thats how they stole my car from me because there is mo way i had that type of money so they threatened me by suing me for the bill so i came down to the shop and spoke to the owner this guy named Hiro we came up with a deal which i would give him 2,500 dollars and the title to the car and that would take car of the storage fees and everything else they where trying to sue me for anyway there is a lot more that went on after but i really wouldn't recommend this place to anyone there con artists by the way i am an amputee and a vet and this happened last year during christmas and it continued till this christmas this guy Hiro is a really bad guy he goes around screwing people over and i just think thats so wrong this guy wanted 10,000 dollars from me to get my car back the 2,500 i already gave him plus another 7,500 unbelievable yes it is I'm a father of 4 and just after the holidays this guy didn't care about ripping me off so now i want to make sure this does not happen to anybody else thank you for reading this</review>

<Text>This company is a a big ol’ scam. Don’t do business or you will regret it. If you’re like me, I was sooocited by a truck driver. So, I didn’t have time to check reviews. Beware these ppl are unprofessional and crooks. I’m still trying to figure out why the tint on my back window was removed. Plus I still don’t have my car and they’ve had it since 4/9/18 and it’s 6/5 and I promise I only had $1k max damaged and they’re trying to bill my insurance company over $8k! When confronted, they told me I needed better insurance. I have Allstate!<//Text>< userid>

CONSUMERS beware. if you take your vehicle here be sure to have them list any charges or they will entrap your vehicle and you will spend a lot of time , money and resources in to getting your vehicle back. It has been almost 3 months now and I still do not have my vehicle. They have not repaired it. They said they only way I can have my vehicle back is if I pay them close to $5,000 for storage fees. They never informed me of any fees when I brought the car there. They delay the process in returning your calls, never give you an exact number as to how much it will cost to have your vehicle repaired. *****STAY AWAY unless you want to end up fighting them in court for consumer fraud and negligence.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

< Review>
Please be aware of this place, maybe it's not bad for everyone, but it definitely was for me and half the other people who reviewed it. After having my car towed to Airport collision right after my accident, this was my experience.
Customer service: Grade D
The women at the front desk will tell you the most basic and generic answers to any question you have. If you ask when your car will be ready they will always give you the generic answer "2 weeks" when in reality your car is not being worked on & if you look at other reviews on here they will say the exact same. If you ask to speak to the owner Hiro, he's always "out".  If they say they will call you back, they won't! There was only one lady who called me back and she was very nice, but the rest of them are just sitting on pay roll reading from note cards, what it seems like. The only time I received any information that helped me was when I spoke to Hiro himself, he broke everything down and explained it.

Repair service: Grade D
When I went to see the progress of the car, I came to find out that whenever they moved my car they destroyed my rear diffuser that attached to the bottom of my rear bumper( my car had front end damage only, the rear was completely fine) & it was completely bent. They ended up bending it back, but that just let's you know they don't take every step to make sure they don't cause damage to customer vehicles.
When I finally got my car back after weeks of them saying it's going to be done on a particular day, my car a 07 BMW Was in limp mode which reduced the power of my car drastically. When I brought it to their attention they ran the codes and one was 30cf for my waistgate and they said they did not touch those components so I gave them the Benefit of the doubt because that part is apart of my turbo which should not have been touched. So I take it to my mechanic and he straight up tells me that whoever fixed my car did a sloppy job when it came to putting certain parts back, they also did not put my belly pan splash guard back so now there's nothing protecting my engine bay from road debris. My Mechanic plugged back in one of my vacuum lines that was not put back in and the code went straight away( job was so easy he didn't even charge me). Now keep in mind when I brought it back to Airport collision they did not even try to look underneath the hood, they ran the codes and decided they were not at fault and sent me on my way and assumed no responsibility. Also my driver side window controls did not work at all (not blaming them) however when I brought it to their attention they told me that they would order the part, after 2 weeks of waiting for this part I ended up getting it on my own & ive yet to be called..The paint came out very nice I must say and I didn't have gaps in the parts they replaced, but as a whole my experience was horrible, parts not being put back, damages that weren't there when I first brought the car, horrid customer service, them not being able to take responsibility when they made a mistake. What is done is done, all I can tell the next man is Yelp reviews do not lie, because i definitely looked at them before my car was repaired and everything everyone said was dead accurate. Excercise your options before you take it to this place, this play shouldn't even a last option, there are so many better collision repair centers to choose from. Stay away from this crooked place.< /Review>

<Review>Those crooks convinced me to bring my car there, saying they were going to cut my deductible in half, knowing that the insurance company my policy is with would total out the car even though it's still drivable. While having my car they dismantled it and racked up $1600 worth of storage fees. Now I'm stuck with a car that's unsafe to drive after being in their possession.<//Review>< UserId.>

<Review>Took over two months to complete the work on my car. Owner told me "it sat in the lot for over a month because they had over 50 cars ahead of mine" customer service reps in the front office never return calls, and everytime I call "production" is always on lunch or not in at the moment; which is probably why my car took over 2 months. Overall HORRIBLE experience.<//Review>< time>

Bad experience.  My granddaughter called yesterday to make appt and they told her just to walk in. I took her and told her she needed appt. There was just 1 customer in shop and 3 workers. Seriously.  Never will go there again.</text>

My friend recommended me to this nail salon. Walked in and was immediately greeted. A PLUS. Got in and got a full set done by kim. She did a great job, very quiet but super friendly. However, the girl sitting at the first desk bad mouthed about another employee. Clearly, she wasnt trying to be discreet about it. The man who works there was making sexual comments. Made me feel really uncomfortable because there was a child there. Nice salon, work was great. Everyone else was nice, talkative to their clients. If i decide i want to come back, ill request for kim.< /Text>

<Text>I’m writing this review a little late... I should have taken a picture of how bad my nails were done, but it was so bad that I applied my own nail polish on it as soon as I got home to cover the voids in my gel manicure. I think name of the person who did my nails was Lamy ( but not 100% sure). Total waste of time and money.<//Text>< Pics>

Not even worth 1 star. The staff was very rude. They told me and my 2sisters who live two hours away that we could walk in and they'd do our nails and refused to make an appointment keep in mind that we had to drive two hours to get there and once we got there the receptionist said they're not doing nails that day and we'd have to come back another day even though there was two ladies getting their nails done while we were there. The only helpful thing they did was tell us to go to rose nails. Don't even waste your time in this place.< /Review>

<Name>Nicole Hidman</Name><review>Wow just wow.
Was there march 8, 2019 at 5p.m and got a pedi done by mary. I hesitated to give my review because i like this place. However,The service was great no complaints, but jc is something else. The mouth on him. I am a regular here, I come twice a month and normally I am not picky about who does my pedies because everyone there is awesome, funny, and is a great atmosphere. But tonight draws the line for me. I do not tolerate bullying. I have heard him belittle other employees, and I usually brush it off. But tonight takes the cake. How do you say things like that about your peers? The things he say sickens me. He mocked another girl who works there(she wasnt present here today i assume because if she was he wouldnt have bad mouth her this way)  about being ghetto, or in jcs words "hood" and mocked how she talks! And the owner, instead of ending the the conversation laughed loud about it and joined in on the conversation. It saddens me to see such bad attitudes around here. I am a loyal customer. I have seen all the great things this nail shop is capable of doing and how the business has flourished. I just didnt think they are capable of belittling, or bad mouth about other employees. It is unethical of jc or the owner to act this way especially working in this field for over 15 years, or so they claim. I feel sad, angry, frustrated for the girl. She has given me a pedi before and she is such a sweet person, great personality, and out going. I am sad to say but i am very disappointed in jc and the owner and i will not be returning. I will take my hard earned money elsewhere that dont belittle their peers. Or employees in front of customers.< /review><user_id>118242702430749121248</user_id>< time>

This was my second te having my brows done by this lady. My usual last moved to another city. So I thoight I've never had any problems wtoth them so I would try her. Everything was fine Until today I went in to get my eyebrows waxed and just because I told the lady that she made my eyebrows uneven and if she can fix them. She said they seem even to her. She got mad and told me she didn't want to do them any more and she doesn't want me to come in to get them done anymore and that I didn't have to pay.  She ruined my eyebrows and just because I pionted out her mistake she does this. Very unprofessional. Never going back !!< /Review>< Pics>

Had Kim for mani & shellac - cuticles were not done well and gel was not applied well.

Also got a pedi done here, cuticles and callus once again were not taken out well.

Not impressed.< /text>

<Review>I happened upon this Farmer's Market in the park today.

There are 2 designated entrances & exit.
Before entering you are politely asked to wash your hands at a very clean hand portable washing station.
Masks & distancing required.
X's on the ground helped to know how far to stand while in the market area.

It isn't a large Farmer's Market , however it does have a good variety of items available.

Fresh corn is 5 for $1
I got a watermelon for $7< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x809ad05d99c34347:0xd5305e708b81af87<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Hands down awesome market, great produce and great prices. Also a variety of other foods from small business like hummus from Xena Foods, fresh baked goods, honey, fresh eggs, and so much more! Best COVID practices I've seen at a farmers market AND I thought it was really awesome that they take people's EBT cards.<//Text>

I loved the farmers and the produce they brought. It  was so fresh,  it was better than anything you can buy at the grocery store.  My sis and I made Friday😊. People were so friendly I didnt realize I was in urban central.im a visitor from Canada. If I could in would go here every week to buy produce. Just happened to be here accidentally. Was thinking that Bernie Sanders was going to here at that time. But it was a info session from one of his support camps. Cheers!!!! Loved it!!!!</Text>

Wish there would have been a flat bread vendor.  Yolanda tamales were awesome.  Picked up some tomatoes and a small loaf of WW Sourdough.  Haven't tried either of those yet.</text>

<text>Been there, done that, live it, will come back. Not only do they have great produce, they also have LOCAL PRODUCE and at least one Black owned farm providing produce.
I'm so happy to see Purple Pig Eats back in action. Oak Park Market also utilized EBT so all are able to buy fresh, wholesome, and local food in their neighborhood.<//text>< user_name>

Love this farmers market. Right around the corner from my house and they also take food stamps. $1 in EBT counts as $2 so its a great bargain</review>

You feel the sense of community most at this Farmers Market.  Great produce, products and vendors, but the people are the best.<//Review>

Smaller by far than the Sunday market under the freeway, but a good selection of vendors, including some esoteric small operations selling Hummus, Sourdough, Artesan Vinegars, Smoked Fish etc. There's enough F&V stalls to make it worth going and the extra stalls add some interest. 'Drunken Loaf' sell their bread there, which is the best in Sacramento. Also the lady selling the Salmon and Halibut - we love her smoked fish!
Ok, it's in 'Da Hood', but it's really nice going there. Mostly there is a musician playing and stalls with information on WIC, Jump Bikes, EBT and other things.
Parking isn't a problem, less oppressive than the Sunday market and you can be in and out in minutes.<//text>

<Text>Was there last year to wash my car. The owners were there and I was washing my wheels with a brush adapter on my drill in the wash area. The time was running, paid time I'm paying for, the Owner said I couldn't do that there because people are waiting to use it. I told her, I'm paying for the time. She said, You still can't do that here, "maybe this isn't the place for you!" I said ok. That's the last time I've gone there. Very unprofessional.< /Text>< pictures>

I disagree with this being an expensive place compared to all others in the county area... However, you may pay for things you will not get like soap for instance if you can figure out where that is on the dial or a vacuum that can pick up glass after someone robbed my car at a local hotel but i suppose you can't win them all.<//Text>

<text>My go to self car wash place. Simple, functional. A little run down but the sprayers and brush always work and economical. Soap spray, rinse spray and soap brush available. Last time I went the bay I had did not have the soap spray; if that's on purpose going fwd then 2 stars, but for now, pretty good and 4 stars for this type of service.< /text><user_id>106127583440779026772< /user_id><Resp>None</Resp><date>1542566758091<//date><pictures>None<//pictures>< name>

Visited this place at first time today. Looks like popular place for DIY car wash. The washing facility is average. Vending machine for quarters working fine.
However, I wouldn't recommend to use vacuum in this place. Vacuum tip is not flat, but rounded (circle). So you can't really clean is some tight spots, like between or under seats.</text>

Run down and uncared for. So bad no one here follows rules; drying their cars in vacuum areas etc. The vacuum I tried hardly worked, lost a dollar in a broken one and can't tell you about the others because people were drying their cars in the vacuum areas. The signs say vac area only dry car by back wall but no one cares. I don't know,  maybe it's the neighborhood....<//Text>

Overall not the best place to wash your car but it's the closest one I could find. What I cannot stand is the person washing a car for over 5+ minutes without consideration for others waiting in line. Nine out of ten times, the ones taking the longest might as well taking their vehicle to the dump. If you have a nice car, you're most likely not washing your own car. On a positive note, the guy in front of me informed today that one of the tubes is busted, which happens often here.< /Review>

The only settings that work are the brush and rinse. No spot free rinse or anything along those lines. Actually had to have my car washed again and put a lot of effort into removing the water spots left behind by using this place.< /text>

Two change machines and it is pretty well maintained. On a sunny day, however, the lines can be long. About six bays, with only one for big monster trucks.

It doesn't say 24hrs,but ive gone at all hours of the clock to wash mycar and the sprayers respond every time. Good pressure,has wash setting,soapy brush setting (with an abundance of soap pouring out) and spot free rinse. Has change machines that take 1's,5's,10's and have never been shorted on the return change. $2 minimum amt. to activate the machine;can add .25's for additional time. Well kept/mainained.Clean.On site manager lives in RV at the premises..</Review>

It's all do-it-yourself hand-work, but, there ya go.</Review>< Pics>

This is a typical coin-op self-service car wash, however, this place is run down. There is graffiti around the area while the equipment is run down. Things to note:

+ Coin machine dispenses quarters, not tokens
-- Nozzle options are 'Soap' 'Foam Brush' and 'Spot Free Rinse'. The spot free rinse is just water, which includes many many water sports once you use it.
-- There is no wax options, nor a compressed-air drying option.

This place is very limited and isn't really worth it, unless you just need to spray mud off. Beyond that, go elsewhere.<//review>

<review>Everything was broken. Brush left scratch marks.  Go only if you need to spray with water and want to spend $5 doing it.  Many others better maintained.<//review>< pictures>

Best coin-op around. DO NOT go to the one off Saratoga and Stevens Creek. Way too expensive. Been coming to this coin-op all my life. It does get SUPER busy but totally worth the wait!<//Text>

<username>Grisha L<//username><Review>This place is great, especially if you come middle of the day durjng the week. The prices are great i usually get out of there only spendjng like 3 bucks to a wash. You get a better wash when you actually scrub as opossed to those drive thru places. The weeekends however avoid like the plague you can wait over half an hour. There arw coin machines there so as long as you have cash youre good.< /Review><rate>5< /rate></record>

<Review>The place is filthy. I don't think they've deep-cleaned the bays in decades, as there is black mold everywhere. In the bay I chose, the foam brush hose arm was tangled with the spray hose arm, which made washing my vehicle properly, impossible. The floor mat clips were broken, so I didn't get to clean them. The selector dial was missing indicators for some of the options. I think my vehicle was dirtier than it was before. Avoid, unless you hold your car wash standards really, really low.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x808e351f9aa1c065:0xa7d42f331af008df</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This is my partner's and my FAVORITE Mexican place in the area. It is amazing. The staff are nice. Did I mention the food is amazing? Plus their prices are reasonable especially for the amount and quality you get. We get their carnitas super burritos all the time and for $10 those things are two meals for me and taste amazing.<//Review><user_name>Kyra Neilly<//user_name><Response>None</Response>< Pictures>

I expect seasoned flank or skirt steak. Also, the chips were refrigerator cold and the salsa was flavorless as well. Would not recommend.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

HINT: Get the grilled shrimp tacos 😍😍😍.

Been going back regularly and it never disappoints.  They're open late and have dine in as well as take out.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<review>Disappointed.  Requested no onions because of a medication interaction and the food was loaded with onions.  Only food in a 12 hour shift. A real bummer. What I could eat was bland or sweet. Lots of other amazing locations nearby.<//review>< pics>

Las Cazuelas was a very cleaned and well polished restaurant.  Although I took my visit during take out and outside eating only time, the i side space appeared to be a place to eat and relax.
The food wad good, service fast and staff friendly.  I'd definitely recommend!< /text>

It's pretty good. Zarape is better.

Portions are solid, flavor is good. The Al Pastor was excellent. Price for value is also very good.

I'd eat here again!< /text>

Best shrimp quesadilla ever, and they're amazingly consistent.  I've only been to the one in Seaside, CA.  They get it right every time.  Important because since surviving cancer I'm pickier than ever.<//text>

New favorite! Best taqueria in the area. Exceptional quality, not oily or stale. Have tried almost everything on the menu. Al Pastor tacos are crazy good. Chips and salsa bar while you wait. Friendly staff. I could eat here every day!</Text>

Amazingly delicious food. I ordered the quesadilla plate (carne asada) which comes with rice and beans but is also available ala carte  I accidentally also ordered an agua fresca (I was trying to get a free water cup for their delicious looking lime infused water) which was also quite tasty. I ended up drinking a glass of the horchata and then refilling with the complementary lime water.
The waitresses were well mannered and thorough. Very impressed and looking forward to returning to try something different. (I'm thinking fish tacos!)</text>

<text>Veggie burrito rocks big time all you can add at the side kiosk I call it. It over filled me beams rice guacamole, fresh ripen cucumbers, pico de Gallo, vinegar jalapeños and carrots as might as well call it all you can eat with side. It costed me 8.59 for vegan burrito very extremely satisfied because of the sides you can add.< /text><username>Allen Enriquez</username>< userid>

So, been looking forward to review this place. Let me tell you why. I have been coming here for about two years at fist with a friend, who told me i had to check this place out.
Now you guys know, i keep it real and honest...... So here I go.
At first, it doesn't seem like much to look at. I mean its kind of dry and dead looking, on the outside and the Taco truck next to it kind of threw me off.
Oooh, but don't judge a book by it's cover really!!
Walking through the front gates you immediately enter an oasis with the standard old school gardners shack at front and center. They have a variety of cement and ceramic decor and a few things around the shack. What really got me is the selection of trees and different shrubs and roses, palms big and small there is allot. They even make there own potting soil and my plants thrive in it.

However the best part of coming here is picking Freddie's brain about plants and how to grow em and keep them alive. What's good for seasonal or all year round, i mean he is a wealth of information. Always friendly and professional and sticks with you till you are done. I've seen him many times interact with customers and honestly i can say I've never seen him walk away from one until they were done.

So all in all i highly recommend this place giving it a whole hearted👍👍👍👍👍🤠....I would also like to add a special note of thanks to Freddie for donating all the plants and soil to help our church House of Refuge with restoring an elderly woman's garden, it was a great thing to see how happy she was. Made possible by his donations.< /text>

I have been here a few times now. I heard about their prices on rose bushes so I had to go see for myself. I was pleasantly surprised at the selection. A bit hard to find some things you just have to look. Knowledgable staff. The prices and the closeness for me are unbeatable. I will continue to come and tell people about it as well. Oh and do bring cash they don't take card.< /review>

<Text>We visited the nursery on Saturday. But the person helping us was very rude. Not at all customer friendly. Selection was very limited may be due to the season.  I would not visit it a second time. And yes they do not accept CC.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Great prices and selection you have to hunt but well worth it. They have freindly staff but place is big and they are hard to find. Once you do f9nd them it makes shopping easy. Parking amble and safe, nursery is easy to find. Worth the short country drive plus if you dont find something you like they have a good taco truck on site</Text>< Response>

<review>I have been coming to this dentist for 10 years. Having switched insurances/dentists and moved all over SoCal, I can confidently say that Dr. Tatulyan is absolutely the most gentle and skilled dentist I have been to. He spends time with each patient and really explains how to best proceed given your specific situation. You can tell he really cares about his patients rather than simply trying to promote the business side of his practice. If you are looking for a family dentist in the valley this is the ONE. Not to mention it’s conveniently located down the street from Cleveland and other schools.< /review><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c29bb77c2039d3:0x4138539c771ae511< /GmapID></record>

Years back I had a crown done for my front tooth but it was paper white making it very obvious I had a fake tooth.  Recently I made the decision to have it redone with   Dr Tatulyan and I love it!!! I now smile without being self conscious.  Him and his team are amazing! My family and I aren’t going anywhere as long as he is around.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<review>I've been seeing Dr. Tatulyan and his team for a while and refuse to go anywhere else. The team is absolutely incredible; they're thoughtful, gentle, kind, funny, interested in their patients, and passionate about their work. Not only are they incredible people, but they're also fantastic at their jobs. Dr. Tatulyan is quick and nimble, each time I've gone in for anything it's been completely painless. They're wonderful and I highly recommend!< /review>< response>

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Super friendly and professional staff. Extremely accommodating and attentive to the patients. I always learn something new about general oral care that can be applied at home to keep my teeth healthy. I remember I had misplaced my receipt after a visit. I called the office and asked if there was any way they are able to reprint it, they told me sure and I can pick it up at my follow up appointment which was coming up in a couple weeks. When I got to my follow up appointment, the receptionist handed me the sheet to sign in and my receipt. She already had it printed and ready for me. I didn’t have to remind anyone or anything. Simply amazing customer service. Definitely glad I started coming here.< /Text>

He helped me with my teeth in a way that really helps with my confidence. He's also very gentle, informative, and funny. I would recommend this office to ANY ONE.</Text>< pics>

The staff always makes a point to remember your name and give you goodie bags after each visit. The doctor has one of the best "bedside" manners I have ever encountered in dentistry. He will explain each step in detail and why it is important while making sure that it is comprehensible. I absolutely recommend if you are looking for a new dental office.</review><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

This clinic is phenomenal. I haven't been to any other practice where I walk away feeling that they really do care about me as a patient. They run a smooth operation and are extremely knowledgeable and accommodating.< /review>

< Review>
The Best Dentist I ever had in my life. Dr. Tatulyan is so caring, knowledgeable, and very gentle. I never felt any pain on deep cleaning, root canals, wisdom teeth removal and fillings. He is very caring doctor, for him patients are very important be without pain. Once i had very bad pain it was his day off he opened his office for me. I only recommend DR.Tatulyan, he is number 1 doctor. Also his assistants Pinkie and Rachel are the best. Love them all. Thanks to my doctor for my healthy teeth!</Review>

I highly recommend this dentistry clinic. My family and I have been coming here for years. Dr. Tatulyan and his entire staff are wonderful. Everyone is so kind, caring and helpful, It’s always a pleasure coming to my check ups. What I love most is that Dr. T takes his time explaining each step to what he’s about to do. During procedures he continues to talk you through what he’s doing which definitely helps me keep calm and comfortable. So if your looking for a great dentist, look no further, Sterling Smile is honestly one of the best 😁</review>

If you're looking for an amazing dentist, look no further, you're at the right place. Dr. Tatulyan is an honest, skilled professional, and an all-around good person. He explains everything thoroughly and gives great alternatives for all procedures. He has a very gentle touch, so if you're scared of going to the dentist, this is the place you should go! The staff  working with him are also very helpful and extremely friendly, making your visit a pleasant experience. I'm so glad to have found a wonderful dental office and highly recommend him to everyone.</review>

<review>Absolutely love this clinic! Dr. Tatulyan took the time to explain every procedure before and during all the work I had done. He is very attentive to make sure I was comfortable and in the least pain as possible.
I'm totally in love with the staff. Pinky, Kristine, and Rachelle are very loving and caring people. Their attitude made every visit easy and fun to look forward to. They literally put a smile on my face :)<//review>< pics>

I have been going to Dr. Tatulyan for many years now and can say that he is a true dedicated professional dentist which I have had excellent results and great experience with.
He works with you on a  budget and insurance coverage and never tries to sell you procedures which may be costly and unnecessary.
One of his best qualities I really appreciate is his gentle touch, you never feel the pain in his care and I could almost say that local anesthesia is not even needed for most the procedures.
I recommend him to anyone looking for a great dentist!< /Review>

<Review>This office was recommended to me by a friend. It is, by far, the best dental office I've ever visited. Dr. Tatulyan and his wonderful staff are extremely caring, and make you feel the most comfortable about having dental work done. The doctor is very detail oriented, gentle, and will let you know exactly what he is doing step by step. I really appreciate that the staff has made me feel like as if I am their only patient through their friendly welcome in the office, and by working with my schedule for appointments. They also keep you thoroughly informed about the work being done and upfront with billing.
I have gotten a cleaning, X-ray check up, fillings done, and currently undergoing Invisalign treatment.
Thoroughly recommended!!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Gmap_id>

Dr. T and staff are amazing!  I have never had a better experience with a dentist before.  Dr. and staff take the time to explain all procedures and what the plan of care will be. I've always had anxiety about going to dentist, but not any more. The ambiance is relaxing. You will not find a better dental office as Sterling Smile Dental Care.  I recommend them to anyone who is looking for a great dentist and staff.< /Text>

Dr. Tatulyan and his staff are professional, friendly, caring and dental experts!  I have been a patient here since Dr. T. took over from the previous Dentist. What I like most about Dr. T is that he really cares and is very concerned about not only my dental health, but my overall comfort while in the office. Every procedure is done with patience and accuracy. His entire staff shows that they really do care about me!  His gentle hands and caring work make going to my appointments easy.  I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Tatulyan! Thank you for taking such good care of my teeth!< /review>

My wife and I have been going to Dr. Sergey for years.  He consistently impresses us with his knowledge and technique, and his focus on delivering the highest quality care.  He's also personable and patient-centered.  Dr. Sergey is the best I've ever had at giving local anesthetic injections!  My wife is very happy with the appearance and comfort of the crowns that he's put in.  I would add that he will take the time to answer whatever questions you have.< /review>

Sergey Tatulyan and his team are AMAZING! I never enjoyed that dentist and orthodontist office as a child, but I honestly LOOK FORWARD to coming here! The Doctor is very gentle. He explains everything as he works. I've never doubted that everyone has my best interest when I'm in their care. I've gotten to know everyone like family and I'm blessed to have that type of relationship with dental care.< /text>

<Review>I can say that in all my years I have never met a dentist quite like Dr. Tatulyan. I went to Dr. Sergey originally to find out more about invisalign and he made the process so simple for me. The trays that I had to wear were convenient and the best part about them was the fact that they were not noticeable to anyone. I saw a difference in my teeth even after the first trays and really loved the results after I was finished with the whole process. With the welcoming and kind nature of all the staff at this office the experience of going to the dentist is made much more enjoyable. I have come to this office for a couple years now and I can truly say that I am completely satisfied. I go to Sterling Smile for all my dental needs and can not find one bad thing about Dr. Sergey and the rest of the staff.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c29bb77c2039d3:0x4138539c771ae511< /Gmap_id></record>

Dr Tatulyan has been my dentist since high school and there’s a reason I always come back. His staff is so helpful and they go above and beyond to ensure that they are able to provide the best care. Pinky is the absolute best, she always makes sure to have open and constant communication with patients regarding insurance, co-pay, coverage, etc. Dr Tatulyan is super gentle yet very thorough, it a deep cleaning without spending so long in a chair. Honestly they’re my favorite dental office to go to.< /review>

< Review>
I haven’t been to a dentist in a very long time other than an Orthodontist for braces.  This is because I was traumatized at a young age —neglecting the health of my teeth. I didn’t know I had cavities since my teeth seemed clean. I use a water pick and a sonicare tooth brush. When I went in, I was greeted by Kristine and Pinkie, they were both super friendly and accommodating with my situation. Dr. Tatulyan was very nice and has very gentle hands! My childhood dentist was rough and didn’t wait for the numbing gel to kick-in as opposed to Dr. T, he was very patient and didn’t rush the procedure, making it a pain-free procedure. He clearly explains to you what he is going to do and explains why. I had a deep cleaning and have had my cavities removed, all of which have experienced no pain at all during the procedure, even after the numbing gel has worn off hours after.

The facility is located at the corner of Wilbur and Roscoe Blvd and can easily be missed. Parking is located in the back of the building. It shares the parking space with another clinic located inside the building.

Overall, I would highly recommend anyone who is afraid to go to the dentist or is very sensitive to pain to go to Sterling Smiles, you won’t regret it!

Cheers! :)<//Review>

I live approximately 27 miles from Dr. Sergey's office, and could find a dentist in closer proximity to my home, but I believe the quality of care is important, and I am willing to make the drive to get my dental care from Dr. Sergey.  He always takes the time to explain each procedure, which is important to me.  His office staff is also wonderful...Pinky, Rachelle, Kristine...!!!  Thank you Dr. Sergey!!!< /Review>

Not only is Dr. Tatulyan a very good professional, but is also very intelligent and I always enjoy speaking to him about a variety of subjects, which makes the overall experience a very pleasant one. He is very patient wtih everyone and kind to his staff. My husband's teeth were in horrible condition a few years ago. He has a perfect smile now thanks to Dr. Tatulyan! Give him a visit and you will not regret it.</Review>

Dr. Tatulyan is a skillful and caring dentist. His professionalism and knowledge is of the highest level, and I would recommend Sterling Smile Dental Care to anyone looking for a great Northridge and San Fernando Valley dentist and dental staff.< /Review>

<username>Ma Cano< /username><Text>I’ve been going to Dr Tatulyan’s dental office in Northridge, CA since 2012 and by far he’s been the best dentist I’ve ever been to and I can confidently say that I will never look for another dentist ever again. He explains all my dental treatment in detail and always made it sure that I am well informed. His staff are always helpful, kind and caring and makes me feel like I’m family in their office. One of the things that I Iove about him and his staff is  that they always make sure to pre-approve my treatment needed to be done to my insurance before starting any dental procedure. I will highly recommend him because he is an excellent dentist that takes pride in everything that he does.<//Text>< rating>

Huge yard... however they do not permit you to wait for delivery time on it... try to time it so you arrive at your appointment exactly (good luck) or you will be sent out to crowded street with huge truck and trailer to drive around until they call you. Not sure why they do this.. they have done it always... they don't care about your problems. I think they like neighborhood to know that trucks come in and out all day. Lol. Only reason I can reach when 99.9 of businesses welcome their freight and truckers, and respect the reasonable early delivery. It comes off as a hard slap to truckers but I am sure they feel powerful and arrogant in their actions.<//review>

Charged $40 for a case of Aquafina water, this is something that would cost $4 at Sam's Club. We asked for a refund and never got it back. Customer service was unhelpful and told us they would call us back but never did. Emailing them didn't help just gave us another number to call. Very frustrating!< /text>

This is because the lowest are you to give her place  is one star. I went to this location to deliver a load that was treated like lower dirt by the security personnel not only did he talk to people like they were not educated he also ran up in my face try to confront and try to intimidate me. Afterward he decide to lie about what happened. This place is very unprofessional and I pray that I never have to deal with them again.< /review>

I usually could eat a large bowl of pho by myself, with egg rolls on the side. If you guys are looking for a good place to eat, this would be a good spot to start. They also open early at 8am in the morning. Most noodles places only open at 10 or 11.</Review>< pictures>

For a small town I'll give their bahn mi and service 5 stars. The bang mi is pretty decent size unlike some other places in Modesto that use the dinky diamond shape small mexican bread. The owner/ server was nice enough to accommodate my last minute decisions and honest when asking questions. Their bahn mi bread tastes fresh even though they are not made in house and very flavorful. Fast service too.<//Text>

Located nearby the Waffle House, this new business is surely a place you need to experience.  I like a good well seasoned Juicy "Duck" rice plate.  It was delicious,  veggies on the side to cleanse your palate, with quantity  and quality to match.  Also ordered was their pork egg rolls, it was crispy with just the right amount of filling to satisfy your appetite.  As usual this review is just my opinion,  give them a try, you might love what they have to offer.  They do have specials and a steam table for combination plates.</Review>

DUCK IS NOT FRESH!!! Ordered the duck plate and duck was still cold in the middle which means they just reheated it. Tasted old. Good luck!!</Text>

The dining area is spacious, and I felt comfortable with my papa there. There wasn't much of a crowd there when I went there, but I think that's mostly because it's new and not in the most popular part of town. That being said, the food was good, if a little bland. I think that can be fixed easily enough. I really liked it though.< /review>

Picked up curbside. Met the owner very friendly and gracious! So far we only tried the bahn mi sandwhiches which were awesome. I have a feeling this will be on our regular rotation of local favorites. The menu looks great and they even have whole roasted duck! Be back soon with updates<//Review>

New place that had opened up this year and I'm very grateful they did. The food on their menu is so delicious and all for a very reasonable price. Their dining area is kept clean as well as their bathrooms. The also offer delivery for orders over $40 so I'll definitely be ordering from them soon< /review>

I was looking for a real Vietnamese restaurant in Modesto for a while, and now I get it. This restaurant has many choices for customers, and the food has taste almost the same with home country- Vietnam. I highly recommend this place for everyone. Delicious, full, and good price 👍🏻< /text>

This is a fairly new place. They are definitely still getting their bearings and trying to figure out who they are in the community but they have a lot of heart. The food is terrific the pho is definitely a labor of love and it shows. The service is also really good. This place is my go to for pho now.<//Review>

Not too bad. First time trying this place today. Stayed away before because heard there were bad yelp reviews. But overall it's good. The pho was good.. you can taste the msg big time. The banh mi sandwich is good. I have to say the best in Modesto. I will come again soon for that.</review>

Omg best pho I've had I usually drown my pho in houesing sauce it was so Rich in flavor didn't need it good quality meet.
Waitress was very nice, clean restrooms and nice decor. Can't wait to try other items on menu.</review>

The soups are really good totally worth the wait. Shakes are awesome aswell the only thing what would make it even greater is adding pearls to the shakes but overall 10/10 easy highly recommend<//text>

The only items they have at the entree table is chow mein and fried rice, two other choice of dish that looks like it's been sitting for quite a long time. Food was really bland, no flavor. Need more items to choice.</Review>

Great experience!! Took my wife and daughter to dinner, and to satisfy my craving for some good pho! The bahn mi sandwich was super good and the pho was the best I've had in years! I'm from San Jose, so I've had alot of pho from different places, and this place nailed it!! The service was awesome, and I even got to tslk to Sonny and Christina and learned we all came from the same areas, growing up!!We will defintely be coming back for more!!< /text>

How exciting to find this local, family owned incredibly great doughnut shop.  We really splurged and bought so many different ones.  Each one was so fresh and delicious!  You must give them a try!< /Review>

Super friendly service, I was trying to buy some donuts, but wasn't sure how to choose, so I asked that Asian lady help me out. She really did a wonderful job! After chose, she told me that she put a donut that has some bacon on it. When I came home, the first thing was try that bacon donut, OMG, soooo tasty! That becomes my favorite donut! I need to drive almost 20min to go there, but really worth it!< /text>

< Review>
Love stopping in here for a quick bite at 4am. It's so rare for anywhere to be open that early anymore but with its location right next to the highway going out of town it's a perfect place for us commuters to get something to start our morning off.< /Review>

<Text>Dough boy is a good name for this donut shop. Because the donuts are definatly doughy and not cooked all the way. I live less than 1/4 mile from there. And will drive the extra mile to Royal Jelly Donuts. Now they have fully cooked donuts that are delicious!</Text><Resp>None</Resp><Time>1545837083658< /Time>< Gmap_id>

Try their maple and bacon bars or their massive cinnamon rolls.  And you can't pass up their giant apple fritters.  They are awesome!
They also have filled donuts, with different fruit fillings or custard or my favorite a maple bar split down the middle with a big stream of custard.
They have also have coffees that beat Starbucks and Pete's.
Family run place for years.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80850ca53f12c3a3:0xc7fb3ec596fec48b</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Staff it always amazing. But wow today kept getting worst and worst. You would think they would be MORE careful and CLEAN bc of COVID-19 but not only did we get 2 DIRTY glasses.. it only came with 1/2 the shot after we returned them. Lol we come here every week.. sadly not coming back for a while.. Going to El Tarasco for now on :)< /Text>< pictures>

We went in late on Wednesday night. There was a DJ outside and the vibe was great! We were seated indoors where it was much quieter, although the decor was still awesome! I ordered the Siete Mares Fajitas and they were pretty good! 👍</Text>

I have definitely had better food. Salsa has no taste.. it's like pace picante sauce from the jar...chips taste taste like the bag too. My Margarita  was good.. not worth the 100 dollars spent there on dinner for 2..w 2 drinks.... I wont go eat there again.<//review>

I ordered they're canned asada platter with a quesadilla and best believe that steak was so dry almost like its been frozen for like a month it wasn't even tasty.The enchilada was good but I mean its a enchilada My buddy just ordered some beans with chorizo and some grilled onions and jalapeños and the 2 tacos he gave me tasted so much better than my whole meal this place was good at some point its not even average anymore, should of gone get me some burgers instead of wasting my money here.<//text>

<text>Bland food, even though the mistake was rectified with a discount (ty) but the lady that did it never apologized and didn't think she did anything thing wrong and the manager was sucking up to her and never apologized himself also half of the order was cold waiting to get the other meal disappointing<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Finally a man comes to tell us your server will be right with you. So we waited and waited around. When our server came he was good. The food was ok nothing special the molcajete was mostly beans. The sauce on the enchiladas looked like can sauce. The horchata was pretty good.< /Text>< pics>

There was a band here for years on Wednesdays and then they vanished for some reason no one knows (the staff said "I dunno" when I asked about it) but now they are back on Tuesdays @7:30... They play on the patio now but they still sound awesome! So the food is delish... the ambiance is relaxing... the drinks are yummy and then you dance to make the night complete.

Good music... lots of people fun place to go!  Everytime I'm here it's shoulder to shoulder and hot inside.  Takes a minutes to get a drink tho.  Friendly staff and seems like a secure place.  Clean bathrooms was a plus for anyone who's had a few drinks!<//Review>

I just have to say is WOW!!! We celebrated my parents Anniversary and from beginning to end the best service JC and Felipe were the best. The food is amazing, drinks are great and overall the room was well decorated and spacious for our guest. We had such a great time and the manager was very generous and kept checking up to make sure things are running smoothly.  I will recommend this place to anyone . The experience was great and will be returning.</Review>

We only came here because Xeviches was too packed and we were starving. Four adults and a baby. The music was really loud but that's fine. They seated us quickly but didn't bother to mention that I wasn't allowed to wear a tank top until we were seated. I guess you can enforce whatever arbitrary rules you want if you own the restaurant, but we also have the right to leave and drop a 1 star review. It was too loud for us to even hear each other anyway, so it worked out perfect.
Next time I come, we will all wear 90s neon windbreakers and gold chain necklaces and pants covered in dirt, which does not violate your dress code. ;)</Text>

Horrible service waited 4 hours in line waited 3 hours for a cantarito and got kicked out for not ordering enough food. Izucar the manager said it himself! This place is horrible tv is only for selective few and those sitting in the back are treated poorly even with a reservation.<//review>

Great place to have fun dancing, drinking, laughing. Good music. I highly recommend. Just be patient to find a parking spot. But it is worthy.< /review>

Ambiance :

Music was painfully loud and Im used to loud . They had a mariachi which I love but their speakers were blasting  to try to cover the music from their small bar in the next room. The bar was louder than any night club and it was just a very uncomfortable experience.  I walked out with a headache.

Food:

Mediocre .  They serves in big plates that are mainly 95% rice and beans.  The food is nothing  special and overpriced.  We had Shirmp al mojo de ajo and  it was undercooked and they used garlic seasoning instead of real garlic (8 small shrimps. I counted them). We ordered salad instead of rice and beans and don't have a single homemade dressing. The spicy  salsa was basically canned chipotle  chillies with some seasoning.  The bacon wrapped shrimp was okay... bacon was a little burned . The taquitos were okay and enchilada was just okay. Margaritas tasted like a lemonade kool-aid.

This place has so much potential the place it's really nice and  they have good menu but they lack  good chef and good management.<//text>

Very authentic and delicious Mexican food! The ambiance is very welcoming and you feel even for just a moment as if you're in a restaurant in Mexico. I highly recommend the short ribs in salsa 🤤😋😀</Text>

Sunday brunch was excellent. Fresh home made totillas made the meal especially nostalgic for me. Nice atmosphere the only issue was the parking lot is small. So crowded days it maybe difficult to park. Overall I definitely enjoyed the meal and atmosphere.<//Review>

The outside and inside of the building itself is very nice. But the table set up reminds me of a cafeteria. Before entering into the restaurant I expected a lot more. The price of the food was way high when compared to the seating arrangements. The food is not bad but I thought it could have been better. The atmosphere was almost there.</Text>

I have mixed feelings about this place.  The food menu is limited in the sense that it’s all the same just with different meats. Which is also limited.

The best things about this place are:

1. Breakfast buffet: a great selection of food, including a taquero.
2. Molcajete sampler
3. Freshly made flour tortillas<//Text>

<Review>The favorite item for me at this restaurant are the out of this world homemade flour tortillas.  Order some if you get the chance.   This place is large and well appointed.  The bar is separated from the dining area and features live music on some nights.  Since it was late when we arrived we shared some appetizers.  The queso fundido was delicious with generous portions of chorizo, and the delicious flour tortillas.  Service was a little slow and inattentive for a pretty slow week night.</Review>< name>

Food is ALWAYS amazing! Only reason its not 5 stars is because they under staff waiters and it sometimes takes to long to get continuous service. But food is on point!< /Review>

My wife and my parents visited Casa Torres couple week ago for the  Friday Night Mariachi show which was very entertaining, we all ordered from the dinner menu, I ordered a $20 dinner seafood platter, never the less the waiter served me a completely different looking plate than what was presented on the menu, to start the seafood had a very unpleasant smell like if it was NOT FRESH, it smell like rotten along with grill vegetables these also smelled not fresh, worst of all the sea crab legs were nothing like the menu image, menu image displayed large sea crab legs that look very fresh, the crab legs I was served tasted and smelled like Clorox, and were very tiny and skinny very salted and dried. personally I have never been more discussed eating seafood, I do not recommend this plate to anyone, worst of all management never asked us if the food and service was satisfactory, I do not Recommend this venue. very unhappy customer.<//Review>

The best Mexican food. The lunch specials are cheap and very generous. Carnitas on Mondays only.

Since the interior of the building is domed, it must have been made with steel re-enforced concrete.

Concave ceilings aren't good for amplified music and loud crowds. So acoustics is bad and cell data service is weak.

When I eat there and there is live music, I eat in the patio. I get the same great service.< /text>

My wife and I went for Valentines Day dinner. Food was very good service was fast and attentive (owner stopped by to say hello) live "trio" made it a special night. For dinner in the middle of the work week, this place is great. Large but inviting they even had dancing. In two separate rooms. And didn't have to drive far or fight traffic. Parking is a little sparce. Had to park across the street but no big deal I've parked ferther away when we go to the mall. { :-€)<//Text>

The food usually comes out pretty fast and it comes out hot.  The food is just ok.  I have had the chicken enchiladas, flutas, and tacos.  Nothing stands out in flavor.  From the people I was dining with that had dinner items, that did seem to enjoy there dishes.  One had a shrimp and fish dish that multiple people though was good.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c2902caa0abfc9:0x95e5628910c65ae9<//Gmap_id>< Resp>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>The best Mexican food. The lunch specials are cheap and very generous. Carnitas on Mondays only.

Since the interior of the building is domed, it must have been made with steel re-enforced concrete.

Concave ceilings aren't good for amplified music and loud crowds. So acoustics is bad and cell data service is weak.

When I eat there and there is live music, I eat in the patio. I get the same great service.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2902caa0abfc9:0x95e5628910c65ae9< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I went with party of 15 . the waitress was okay but after most of the food arrived 3 people were left without food. For some reason the cook supposedly drop the ball and 1 child and 2 adults were left waiting . by the time they were seved some of our guest were already getting to go boxes. They are overpriced too . $20 for a plate of food is ridiculous. I wont be going back .<//Review>

So I've been here a couple times and the foods alright. The tortillas de harina are fresh so those are BOMB- I think it's just nice to come and hear the music for special occasions but to come solely for the food is not worth it.

Also a special taco de ojo are all the waiters with their buff arms carrying all those plates.   I wonder is they go scout them at the gym- we spotted one drinking his protein shake.</Review>

Great bar, reasonable price. S3.50 drink specials 4-7pm M-F. DJ or live music almost every night. About 20 TV's and they'll put anything on you ask. Try the margarita de tamarindo. Food is great but a little pricey for me. Love the tostadas de camaron. Security guards inside and out, never roudy. Sometimes hard to find a place to park.< /review>

Apprenlty for this restaurant you need to go casually  nicely dressed.  They didn't let us in since my husband was wearing a tank top.  The security guard had offered him a shirt he could put over his tank top...<//Review>

<username>Daniel Fields</username><date>1550394061969< /date><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>So I've been here a couple times and the foods alright. The tortillas de harina are fresh so those are BOMB- I think it's just nice to come and hear the music for special occasions but to come solely for the food is not worth it.

Also a special taco de ojo are all the waiters with their buff arms carrying all those plates.   I wonder is they go scout them at the gym- we spotted one drinking his protein shake.</Review>< pictures>

This place is over rated the food is  way over priced . I ordered the molcajete not what I expected simply trash and we was a family of 7 and we split the bill and they charged us dubble gratuity which came out to be about $22 on top of the bill never again I will never go back I recommend salsa and beer<//Review>

Excellent customer service, they even gave us margaritas while we waited for our table
The only reason I didn't give 5 stars, that's because chicken plates needs some improvements
Great place to be with friends or family< /Review>

<username>C. Rodriguez<//username><review>Our first visit EVER... Made reservations for a party of 30 a month in advance and everything was great. We were seated immediately upon arriving, chips and salsa to snack on, followed by prompt drinks. We requested orders placed first for the kids and that worked out great.. food didn't take long. In fact food was out for everyone quicker than I expected, despite ordering 10mins after the kids. Service was excellent, food was excellent... and since we were celebrating a baptism, we brought our own cake that they also cut and served for us without an additional cutting fee. Rafael, gracias por todo, fue un placer. Will definitely be back for a date night.</review>< UserId.>

Weak margaritas, over priced menu. Parking is an issue and the staff wasn’t too attentive. The place looks real nice... I think the price of the menu is making up for the investment.</Text>

<Text>Food was overpriced and beyond bland..i ordered a shrimp cocktail wich tasted like water. The service wasnt too bad, the queso fundido was pretty good i think it was the overall salvageable item in the menu...we were a party of 15 and overall werent happy with 12 out of 15 entrees, varying from shrimp,molcajetes enchiladas...
The mariachi played sets of about 6or 7 songs and took half hour brakes in between the 3 sets they played, repeating at least 2 songs in the sets and also sang "feliz navidad" in each one of the 3 sets...so, in reality they only played about 4 to 5 songs ... i would definitely not come back</Text>< Pics>

Over priced and the food isn’t great. Portions are way small. Order was screwed up.  Informed the owner about our first time experience and was promised they’ll make it right but never heard back.

Ordered albondigas soup and there were only 3 small meatballs onions n carrots... mostly soup. 1 carne asada burrito w meat n cheese only but got beans n rice. A taco plate w rice n beans. The bill came to over 50.00!!!

I would not only never return but advice everyone to avoid this place.</text>

I went there for the first time last week and expected more. The waiter was super nice but it was very unorganized when we first went in I guess because of the graduations that were going on in the large parties that were going on. The food portions were not exactly what I expected they could have been a little bit more prepared</Text>

Food poison!!!
I went here last night. I ate chile rellenos and buffalo wings ,
Today i woke like someone is chooking me around quearter to 3 in the morning,i keep coughing.  And the spicy goes in my throat, and nose. I feel like i was food poison. My husband texted me if i was awake. And i said yes.
And he feel the same too.
We texted each other of how we feel. Same symptoms, the spicyness goes in the throat and want to throw up. Looks like they didnt prepare the food well.</Text>

Completely average fare. That is, Mexican food tailored for the average American. There's nothing on the menu for those looking for authentic Mexican food. There's no chicharon, lengua etc. The horchata was of the instant kind. I don't ever need to come back.</review>

This place was recommended from my friend. Sincerely it was the first time going to this place and it was a bad experience. It took and hour just to get my food and when receiving the molcajete it was missing some things that it said on the menu. Once receiving the check I was overcharged until i told the waiter tho take the items thats we didn't order. I would reconsider twice before going to casa torres. It was an unpleasant experience.< /Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The food is not good, the dishes are very commercial.
nothing like home cooking. I do not recommend the very simple dishes for the prices that they have, they should improve .. 7 people went, we did not like it, I give them a star. visiting from las vegas. way to Ensenada .ada

<username>Zagit Zilva<//username><review>(Translated by Google) Service: good
Atmosphere: good
Food: good I expect the rib eye stake cut, I asked for it between medium and 3/4 but they gave it well done and not only that, but it seemed that they fried it or put it on the grill and pressed it to cook it quickly, we even commented that If they did deep fried it was rather fried and not roasted ... From then on everything was fine

(Original)
Servicio: bueno
Ambiente: bueno
Comida: buena expeto el corte rib eye stake, lo pedí entre medio y 3/4 pero me lo dieron well done y no solo eso si no que parecía que lo frieron o lo pusieron a la plancha y lo presionaron para cocinarlo rápido incluso comentamos que si lo hicieron deep fried pues estaba más bien frito y no asado... De ahí en más todo estubo bien< /review></record>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The waiters treated me very well, they keep the place clean, but the dish I ordered was pork in green sauce, but the meat even though they gave me a lot of sauce was already very dry and reheated

(Translated by Google) I love this place is beautiful, but there is something I did not like. The waiter arrives asking us for the order (very attentive) but he did not ask my cousin for the order and El Niño is very sad and said “I don't feel special” that gave me a lot of sadness.
But good mistakes we all make.
The food is delicious, the drinks are also delicious. 100% recommended.

Me encanta este lugar es bellísimo, pero hay algo que no me gusto. El mesero llega nos pide la orden (muy atento) pero no le pidió la orden a mi primito y El Niño está muy triste y dijo “no me siento especial” eso me dio mucha tristeza.
Pero bueno errores todos cometemos.
La comida es riquísima, las bebidas también son muy ricas. Recomendado al 100%.</Text>
