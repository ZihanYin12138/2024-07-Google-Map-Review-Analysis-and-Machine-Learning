Most delicious, different fare. Staff very friendly and welcoming plus they all Invite you back as you leave. Mike our server had great suggestions and remembered what I had to drink the day before. Yes, I liked it so much I returned the very next day! Don't live nearby but well worth the trip.</text>

This restaurant is a good place to eat brunch. The atmosphere of the staff and the store is also good. The price is low and the amount of food is small.</text>

The food, drinks and the atmosphere was great. The staff was amazing, great recommendations on food and drinks, the food came out fast. The only minus is the music was way to loud and very hard to talk to one another. The giant fortune cookie dessert was delicious.<//Text>

It’s a Bar feeling place with unique food. The environment is relax, good for hanging out, food looks nice and taste good. Service is very good, react very quickly. Parking may be  tight since it’s street parking. Brunch is not too hard to have a table. Their Pizza is very delicious! Recommend!</Text>

<text>I've been to Bacari W. Adams for both brunch and dinner. And I definitely recommend their brunch menu. It got a huge variety and the pastry section is just insane! I highly recommend the kimchi fried rice! The ambience for brunch is a lot more relaxed than dinner. A great spot to catch up with family and friends!< /text></record>

A USC favorite. The food is really delicious (although small) and the drink selection is nice. Some of the cheaper wines and beers are not great but if you know what to get on a wine list or which beer styles are good then you'll likely choose good drinks. At this point I've ordered probably half the menu in my 3-4 trips to this restaurant, and there's absolutely nothing I'd advise against. Great place, highly recommend.< /text>

Delicious meal. Outdoor seating is cute on a summer night. Great for a friends get-together.
We really went all out on meat this night. The waitress doesn't seem particularly warm or cold. They seem don't have many staff, that could explain why they seemed to look stressed.
The food was great though:< /review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><review>This was our first time at Bacari but surely not our last. From the hospitable management to the tasty menu offerings and $20 open bar (house wine, beer, and sangria), my wife and I had an enjoyable time. Nick is an awesome manager and was so attentive even while tending to many other tables. We had the --

- kale salad: delicious, with so many flavors, a must order every time

- margherita pizza: simple and yummy

- brussel spots: great flavor and crunch, ours were a little salty but they gave us a new batch that were so much better, would still order them in the future

- spicy chicken wings: SPICY!! But ssssooo good. It didn't have just heat, there were also nice flavors

- lamb kabob: tender and nice Mediterranean spices

- macaroni and cheese: creamy mac and cheese with a bread crumb topping, nothing special but it was still good

- chocolate cake: it was enjoyable, soft, and chocolate-y

- bread pudding: SO GOOD! Next time I am going to order it first because we were too full and (too drunk) to really enjoy this good dessert they had on the menu

Can't wait to come back and try the tacos and more of the pizza flavors. Also, I can't wait to check out the other locations.</review><Name>Wayne Kimball, Jr.< /Name>< pics>

Always top here when I can.  Excellent Italian food.  Nothing fancy, just food food.  It was an unusually hot day so the room was hot since they don't have AC.  First time I was uncomfortably warm, but made up for it with excellent Ciopino, crab salad, and Bay Scallop linguini.< /Review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>I have been coming here for about 7 years or so and the food is amazing, I definitely recommend there red sangria its very popular. The pork belly was mouthwatering, and they have such a good cheese plate
My only complaint was that I had was that they took a really long time to get our bread pudding dessert which was so tasty, but they did comp that and another pitcher of sangria Haha. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.< /Review>< Time>

4 stars for the food, 3 stars for the ambience. It was Way too loud!!! In the end I had to shout and left with a sore throat after dinner. It was like been to a club. I don't understand why it was so loud inside, maybe a lot of the crazy kids nearby coming for celebration.

But food was good. We came during the DineLA time. It was great they had the 1.5 hour unlimited drinks. So we had a lot of sangria. We ordered several dishes to share.

The cheese plate, a big plate and many varieties of cheese and cured meat.

I really like the polenta with eggplant. Crispy polenta was very tasty and went great with the eggplant sauce. It was pretty full after 4 sticks.

The cauliflower, it was not that memorable. Didn't remember the taste.

The burger was pretty big, and tasty. Well, the runny egg makes everything better. I don't eat meat, so I will not be able to comment on burger any more.

The dessert was not that memorable either. Can't remember how it tasted.

Probably because it was too loud inside, the experience wasn't that great. But I like their menu, and lots of options for vegetarians.< /Text>

<text>Would never return. Horrible service from the get go. The menu clearly says "$10 Open Bar Night EVERY Sunday". Apparently this is a mistake from their printer so they would not honor what is printed on THEIR OWN MENU! This is poor management at its best. Not about the money, about the rude service from the manager.<//text><user_id>111014683177804422424< /user_id><Rate>1</Rate></record>

Had a wonderful brunch with some alums here during dinela and loved all the dishes we tried. Service was top of the line, attentive but not excessively so just above and beyond for what I would’ve expected at a casual place. French toast and hash were my favorites. Great vibe, didn’t feel rushed, though definitely got busier over our time there. Also loved bread pudding dessert.  Looking forward to returning and trying the other locations too.</Review>

This place is a hidden gem in Hollywood.
It looks like a small restaurant from the outside, but the real prize is inside... Or shall I say their outdoor seating! Really beautiful patio.
Parking is rather pricey around here, so uber is preferred.
The staff is all very kind and attentive/informative. We asked our waiter what he reccomend and we ordered a couple of things on the menu, and we weren't displeased!<//Review>

I have had a lot of dinners here. This experience was not my favorite. I made a reservation for a party of 4 for 8pm. My party showed up on time. We were told it would be 5 to 10 minute wait. Then when the 30 minute mark hit I asked again about the wait. I was told sorry there was traffic and people ahead of me was late because, of this? If parties are late then they should forfeit their reservation. You should not make people wait beacuse, of their tardiness.  My party was aware of traffic and made it on time. After my third complaint we were offered a round of drinks. We were not sat until 9:05pm an hour and 5 minutes after our reservation. The restaurant needs to honor reservation times or do not take reservations and say first come first served.<//review>

<text>I love this place. When I first read these reviews, I didn't know if Amelie would be able to live up to the hype. But it did. It's cute and quaint, the wine is great (do a tasting) and the charcuteries are on point. You really can't go wrong.

Would recommend this as a date spot or girl's night.

Pro Tip: Make a reservation. It's a pretty small spot and fills up pretty quickly!</text>< Time>

It was nice. I heard of it a lot and it was very nice. The server was really nice. We got the steak tartar...I wish it came with fries like in France and not bread....We also ordered olives that were really good.< /review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><text>While on a vacation from Florida me and a few friends stumbled upon this restaurant. I’m so happy we did because the food here was the best I’ve had while on vacation. We had an assortment of different small plates. Egg rolls, open faced burger, scallops, Mac & cheese, the peppers, tacos, I forgot the name of this dish but it was a puff pastry with fine cheese inside of it. Everything was fantastic! When I’m in the area again I’ll be sure to stop here for dinner. I would come all the way from Florida to eat here again!< /text><Time>1569165443841<//Time>< Rating>

I picked up an order there. The guy at the bar quickly asked if he could help. I informed him of my order pick up and he hastily acquired it. He even wished me a great evening.  Awsome!
Unfortunately,  the food was not for me, but it smelled REALLY good in my car for a bit.
Definitely going back to try it myself.
Btw...it's a pretty cozy place...maybe to bring a date...🤔😎< /Review>

Food is normally good. Service is fine. When the servers are present they are nice enough lol. Had the Scallops( the sauce was 🤢), Brussel sprouts (super tummy) Bacari Fries ( yummy again) and Sangria. They have some pretty good deal days like happy hour Monday through Friday 5pm til 7pm(food and drink specials), Sunday Brunch, and Monday has a fun special deal too.</review>

It has a very nice selection of beers and wines and happy hours options and weekly specials. It also has a weekend brunch option. I generally like the vibe there and the waiters are very cool.
The only thing is, quick bites come in small portions, so one is never enough for me...<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Good ambiance. Good service.

Small portions with good flavor, must of them. Overpriced based on favor price ratio.

Please remove your cheese & salami platter. Your cheese is too dry, need a better technique to conserved the freshers. And the presentation is below average. A single chunk of cheese and two slices of salami. Make an effort and cut the cheese.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

He even put on the type of music we wanted because we were the last people there. The 4 stars are for the food temperature. Even though the quaxaca pasta was very good, it was cold. So was the petit filet. The rainbow beet salad was the best. We all enjoyed the margarita pizza and mac and cheese. Several people said that they would be back. I will too. It's a great little place to visit.</review>< pics>

Beautiful atmosphere, ask to be seated on the patio, worth the wait. The food is Italian, we ordered the grilled octopus which was served with butter beans and was delicious. Next the little gen salad with balsamic dressing simple but delicious, then we had chicken liver pate served with cherry preserve & little pancakes which yummy and the spaghetti pomodoro was delicious. Definitely worth a try, will come back.</Text>

Classy but a bit too expensive for my tastes. They call themselves a tapas place but everything is priced too high. I'm on a 1200 calorie a day diet and still ordered two things plus dessert. The food is really good however.<//text>

Gotta say, this is a great brunch spot. They have great deals and variety of drinks (mimosas, sangria, bloodymary, beer). It's tapas style and the portions are small (usually about 3 plates for two ppl I think is good here?) pricing is decent & it's a fun place to try.
I like their pizza ... I noticed most of their food comes with egg lol

With a friend, I shared a pitcher of sparkling white sangria, the lamb stuffed eggplant (lemony and mouth watering), the seared scallops (favorite dish: perfectly seated scallops and fresh corn. Bigger portion than expected), the ricotta and beet gnocchi (creamy! Soft little gnocchi), and the smoked mushroom grilled pizza (lots of mushrooms on little pizza about the size of a CD). We were stuffed!! And that was about $30ish a person. Will definitely come back, I want to try more!

<review>This place is one of Los Angeles's best kept secret...they have been there for years but my eldest son and I just found out about it.  We ordered seven dishes as well as drinks and every dish was exceptional.

They have a monthly deal as well as 90 minutes drink deal for $20 per person.  Can't be beat...!!!

Please put shrimp and grits on the menu...(in my James Brown voice) please, please, please...!!!< /review>< Resp>

<Text>This is a nice place with indoor and outdoor dining. I sat inside and fell in love with the velvet-like texture seats. We had tried pasta, Italian soda, cocktails, salumi plate, bass, etc. probably too much for 2 people but we wanna try them all. The beat service, right amount of attention. Valet is right at the back of the restaurant. Very comfy temperature and nice little not loud music, I will think of the Ponte for my next meetings</Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

My friend and I went for brunch. It was in an odd downtown neighborhood, not what we expected. The menu was great. Many options. Small plates so the two of us shared four items. Everything was seasoned well and looked beautiful. Coffee and mimosas were very good. Staff is very nice. I'm looking forward to trying their dinner menu.<//text>

Came here with a friend for a Saturday brunch date. We had a trio with the Bacaro burger, French toast, and the fries. My favorite was the Bacaro burger. I loved the ciabatta bread, the egg on top and the seasoned patty. The fries were underwhelming, we even added the additional egg on top, which didn't do much to it. The French toast was good, not too sweet. Service was friendly. There was no wait. Parking was not the best.< /text>

This place is mainly for finger foods and drinks. Tried the Chicken wings, Gorgonzola pasta, Bacaro fries, Grilled chicken breast and Mushroom pizza.
All of them were tasty but my favourites were the wings and the fries. The fries come with a fried egg on top and when mixed, the flavour is amazing.

They have 90 Min bottomless drinks for 20$ per person. You can order either red/ White wine, Sangria, Prosecco or Beer. You can also switch between drinks which is a great option. The vibe of the place is divey and the service is great too. (Thanks Ron!)< /review>

<text>To trendy for my taste. You order your small 'tapas' type of food and the items come out at different times. For a sit down meal and quite time this is not the place. Definitely bar atmosphere. Server lady was either frustrated or it was me. I generally don't ever say anything about a place. If you are down with loud and really noisy small portions and for them to come out at different times, then this is definitely your go to spot. Food takes to long to come out. Came here for brunch and the meal was not what I expected. Food took way to long come out. Not for me<//text></record>

<Review>I was here for brunch and I guess it was nice considering it was near USC-- not much else going on around that area. The food was okay-- not great. Some of the dishes were a bit salty. It's convenient but I wouldn't come back here for brunch.</Review>< user_id>

Bacari West Adams is predominantly a college crowd restaurant. Most students are from USC. As the neighborhood becomes increasingly gentrified, more gourmet style restaurants are setting roots in my neighborhood. Bacari West Adams was my go-to restaurant for taking visitors from out of town or from abroad. This is one place where taste and joy meet in multiple culinary options. Lately though, you will need luck to get a reservation, especially on the weekend. If you are between 1-5 people, be careful with an unexpected surplus charge on your check. As you can be charged a mandatory tip that is applicable only for a group of six or more.< /Text>

Eats: Bacaro Burger with Fried Egg, Roasted Garlic Grilled Pizza, Oven Roasted Bone Marrow, Bacaro Mac and Cheese with Bacon.

I was lucky enough to grab the last table on a Monday night. If that's how it is on Mondays, I see this place easily filled on other nights. The Roasted Garlic Grilled Pizza was the clear winner here. There was a good spice in the sauce which surprised us. A second bite got a bit more spicier, which wasn't bad at all. Good flavor in a flatbread pizza. The Bacaro Burger with Fried Egg was second best. This open faced burger got most of it's flavor from the seasoned medium rare beef. Even the fried egg on top wasn't too necessary, if only to make the open face burger prettier to look at. I'm a typical burger fan so this isn't really a surprise.

The bone marrow and the mac and cheese were a bit of a letdown. The bone marrow was served with 4 pieces of bruschetta bread which to me did not match any of our other tapas dishes in terms of flavor or quantity. It was neat to try once, but I'd probably just grab another burger instead as I would have enjoyed that more. The mac and cheese was not as flavorful as it could have been either even with the truffle help. There's more menu items to choose from which also looked plenty enticing, so just another reason to return.< /text>

Food is good but the menu doesn't offer a whole lot of options in my opinion. But bottomless/open bar options available on Groupon make this place a great find. Noise level may be high if your looking for a quiet brunch. Also, try not to go during USC game days.< /text>

First time visitor last Saturday for a dinner get together and birthday celebration. Thank you to the host for setting this up because its a really nice and hippie joint with tons of selection on their beverage list.

Their alcohol menu is on their walls which is written in chalk board like on both ends. Food wise is small tapas plates. I ordered the bacaro burger which is an open face burger topped with their raspberry compot and a fried egg. It was really good to be honest. Right medium rare burger cooked perfectly.

Also ordered their oven roasted bone marrow and it was delicious. You can't pass up on MEAT BUTTER.<//text>

I was very unimpressed with Bacaro.  I feel like the only reason it does well is because it's one of the few trendy restaurants in proximity of USC.  The food here is certainly good, but the tapa-sized portions are very overpriced and rather underwhelming.

First off, I did not enjoy the cramped, small, dark space inside.  It's probably part of the vibe or atmosphere that they try to create for their restaurant, but it wasn't cutting it for me.  You can barely see inside of the dimly lit interior at night, and the benches for seats are weird and uncomfortable.  Everything feels very tight.

The food itself is very good.  I enjoyed the fries and the macaroni.  They have a lot of simple casual food items such as this.  Do NOT get the Bacaro burger and expect an actual hamburger.  It was the most disappointing and sad looking slab of meat on a piece of bread that I have ever seen.  IT'S NOT A BURGER IF IT DOESN'T HAVE TWO BUNS!!!  Disappointing.

Not worth the cost.  Only plus is the convenience of its location close to USC.  I'll look elsewhere further away, however, for much better dining experiences that are worth the cost.< /text>

This place is pretty neat. I've been a bunch of times so when Living Social had a $40 for $20 deal many months ago, I grabbed it... and then waited until the last possible day to use it. There were three of us. We each chose two dishes (six total) and I think that was just enough to leave us pleasantly full, but not overstuffed.

We had:
baguette with olive oil (not part of our 6 items)
cauliflower with chipotle aioli and mixed greens
pan-seared scallops
artichoke hearts
and three things from the specials menu written on the chalkboard (sorry, I can't remember what they were)

I had a glass of a white blend and a glass of Tintero Moscato (which was, as always, deliciously sweet).

One of the really neat things about this place is that the owners and staff are not pretentious at all about wine. Can't pronounce the name of the wine you want? Who cares? Butcher it. Want to try something before you commit to a glass or a bottle? Go for it! Not sure what to get but know (at least, generally) what you like? Tell your server and have him recommend something.

It's a small place, so be prepared to wait if it's busy. If you're not in a rush, I'd say stick it out (even if the line is long).< /review>

I went here for Happy Hour (Monday - Thursday 5PM-7PM) with my girls on a Wednesday night and was not disappointed. All the portions are tapas size so order away!

What We Ordered:
- Poached Shrimp
- Burrata Di Gioia
- Bacon and Brie Pizza
- Glazed Pork Belly Skewers****
- Crispy Pig Ears
- Lamb Stuffed Eggplant****
- Oven Roasted Bone Marrow
- Mac & Cheese****
- Grilled Hangar Steak****
- Sangria

Everything was so good!! My favorite items are ****.... We ordered 5 orders of the Glazed Pork Belly Skewers!! It was melt in your mouth good. I don't think anyone else really liked the Lamb Stuffed Eggplant...but I really did! It was not gamey and had a lot of good flavor! The Mac & Cheese was perfectly cooked and had the right amount of cheesiness! Most restaurants don't add enough cheese so it's just noodles and bland sauce. This was definitely not the case! The Grilled Hangar Steak was very tender and cooked to a perfect medium rare. All the other items we ordered were good as well!

I do not recommend the Bacon and Brie Pizza. It was just average. The Sangria tasted like juice but, it hit us all later hahah.. granted we had 3 pitchers among 5 girls. :) If it wasn't so far, I would come here more often! They also had an all you can drink sangria option. I will have to try that out next time!</Review>

<Review>Been meaning to try Bacaro for awhile now since I've heard good things so I was really excited to see them on Groupon! I picked up a deal for AYCD and 8 tapas for 4 people and had a great experience. I was worried that it wouldn't be enough food since everything is in small portions for sharing, but I think the AYCD filled us up so the amount of food was perfect.

Bacaro has about 30-40 different tapas to choose from, including cold and hot dishes, mini pizzas, and dessert. If you're thinking these tapas only make up the appetizer portion of their menu, think again. That's all they have! We had no idea which tapas to choose so we picked randomly and had our server recommend a few to us as well. The memorable ones were the bacaro burger, the hangar steak, the fries, and the mac and cheese. I would pass on the Tal's Tower since it's mainly just bread and the shrimp included were pathetically small. I would also pass on the pork belly skewers since it was too sweet and fatty for my taste. I mean I know it's pork belly, but some pieces were seriously all fat.

The groupon made this meal extremely worth it since normally AYCD is $20/person and each tapas is $8 (or 3 for $21). Btw, the AYCD includes only their Bacaro beer, champagne, sangria, and wine for 90 minutes. If you're worried you won't get the most out of your AYCD because you have to wait for your server, I recommend sitting at the bar. That's what we did and our server was on top of it!

If you have a party of 6 or more, be sure to make reservations. This place gets packed since it's right by USC. Parking can be a pain since it's only street. Overall, I had a great time at Bacaro and would return, but I would probably try to go for happy hour when everything is a bit cheaper.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c2c7ec5d711435:0xc4e5b8e93183c6c9<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Why just 3 stars you ask? Especailly with open bar for 90 minutes!?
Well first, i felt our server was has a bit of tude when serving us, he wasnt nice when i asked for suggestions nor was he helpful when we noticed our pitchers were becoming empty. Plus most importantly no free smiles were given!!
My man said he was probably having a bad day or something but really?!

Now the food was also subpar here, i had a panini and when i got it, it was dry and barely edible, I felt like i wanted to let the guy know but because he had such a unwelcoming attitude i just left it, and I hate wasting food!!<//text>

<Text>Definitely one of my favorite tapas spots in LA. I really connected with this cool hole in the wall and the happy hour menu that came with.

M-TH 5-7PM: 5$ tapas and housemade Sangria specials!

FOOD to share:
* Cauliflower with Chipotle Aioli: smoky, spicy, slightly tangy...take note, this will make you like your veggies / cauliflower!

* Fried Egg Pizza: thin, potentially flaky crisp crust, super soft, barely set egg on cheese and something green.

* Poached Shrimp with lots of basil and Sweet Chili Sauce: good shrimp swimming in lots of sweeter-than-spicy (or tangy) chili sauce; slightly reminiscent of something Asian, and the basil...win!

* Eggplant stuffed Lamb with Lemon Garlic Emulsion: such a memorable concoction! there's a slice of fried lemon that totally adds to the cheese-topped eggplant lamb. The lemon and garlic emulsion is the perfect component to this. Enough said.

* Dessert: Panini with Bicycle Honey Wheat Bread, Nutella and Banana: sweet sandwich grilled? yes. not too sweet and the best part, they use bicycle bread! love that co.

AMBIENCE
This place is dressed in all dark features: floor to ceiling chalkboard walls plastered with big writing listing out different wines, beers and other beverages.

A key interior feature is of course the wine bottle ceiling. You'll also quickly notice the other creative wine bottle lighting and furnishings around. There are lots of small wooden panel tables for two that can be pieced together like a puzzle, which means this place has the flexibility for larger parties (also larger table seating in the adjacent area).

Seats are pretty comfy but if you sit along the central small tables and long booth area, you'll be cozy close to your neighbors...in which case, makes for the proper time and place to stare and point, ooo and ahh about what other people are ordering.

It's pretty overpriced, but the food is good. If you go on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night, you're likely to be around a group of drunk college students, which can be pretty loud.</review>

Excellent food, cool atmosphere, good wines.

Pros: The food!! Everything was good. Bacaro burger, roasted garlic pizza, roasted garlic bruschetta, stuffed eggplant, brie & bacon pizza, pastrami w/ gruyere panini, caprese salad. Everything.

Cons: I expected a way better wine selection.</Text>

Just horrible. Small ass portions, small location, no flavor, expensive, the sangria had no fruit, and me and my moms glasses had soap in them. Totally regret taking my mom here for Mother's Day</Text>

(Translated by Google) Things are delicious, the price is not too expensive, the disadvantage is too noisy.

<Text>When I say the Best Customer Service.. I was running around asking for Centric Rings, no one knew what they were. Went to Bud's and I tell you he gave me a 101 on what a wheel spacer is and does... Since I was about to head back to Ga with my moms car I Inherited and he didn't have them in stock, he drove me over to a top quality rim shop (the wheel shop also excellent Customer Service))and I'm omw to Ga.

This is the only place I will take my cars.  I found them several years ago and they have consistently provided excellent service.  They are honest and have never tried to cheat me.  I have recommended them to all my friends and co-workers and they too have become loyal customers.  You can't go wrong with Bud's!<//review>

<review>Went in to get a simply alignment on my vehicle. They said they needed to inspect the truck since the alignment was was off. Dropped it off, few hours later, wanted to charge me addition $100 for the alignment cause they had to readjust the steering arms. After the alignment, it was still way off, so I just drove it home when one of the adjustable bolts flew off. The safety clips were missing. Took it back on a tow truck. They said we will take care of u. Took about 5 days to get my truck back and running. Had to pay additional $100. Front deck were pretty rude, just telling us we knew nothing about cars. Now the right side is cricket. I highly consider going somewhere else.</review>< pictures>

<Text>They did a great job of installing a new tire once . Very friendly people and nice place. So I asked if they do engine work and they do he said. So I had them replace the timing belt on my Mitsubishi Sport about 6 months ago.  After the work,  from day one it rattles like marbles are in the crank now. And it is obvious that the sound is coming from the timing belt area. I took it back and they said it was a external tensioner-  not part of timing belt .  I then replaced all the external tensioners and it still rattles bad on cold start up. I took it back again- they said they could not find anything and gave it back with same issue-  it still rattles bad on start up in morning and it was perfectly quiet before getting the belt replaced. Think twice about getting work done here.
edit 7/22/2019
Bud called personally after reading the review and expressed that he wanted to make my car run like it was supposed to. He very quickly bought the part that we knew was the issue and had it installed.  Now runs much quieter.  They did stand behind there work and i give them credit. Thank you for doing the right thing. Integrity in business is everything.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1561583536449, 'text': 'Hi Lance - we can’t find your name in our system.

Friendly, knowledgeable staff.  Clean and pleasant waiting area.  Sat while my car was serviced and it was done in a reasonable time.  I felt they were honest about what work needed to be done and what I did not need to have done, which I completely appreciate not feeling taken advantage of.</Text>

<Review>[Update] Bud's was finally able to figure out was wrong with my car and also fix it. They were also very apologetic. Of course I'll continue to go to them for car repairs because as I've said before, I've been going to them for so long and have never really had a problem in the past. Thanks a million to the staff for getting my car back on the road again.< /Review><rate>4</rate>< Time>

Great service. My go to auto mechanic shop. Fair pricing, fast service, good recommendations for repairs, very honest.
Had radiator and brakes previously replaced then went in today for a transmission that was leaking. They tightened a few of the pan bolts and said, to my surprise,  that they couldn't find a leak and didn't charge me. Thank you Bud's.<//Text>

I have been taking my car here for over 10 years and I am always impressed by the consistency of professionalism among all member of their team.  The service is always personalized and the quality of the repairs is top notch.  I grew up with a mechanic in the family and I can say this is the first shop I have felt as comfortable as my grandfather's.  Thank you Bud!<//text>

Lack of concern for customer situation. Second time they have not honored what they say and my warranty.... the owner himself had a lack of concern for my issue when he was sitting ten steps away.... Buds Tires doesn’t care about how long you been a customer nor care about how much money you have spent with them over the years.... they deserve zero! When they ask to buy into their warranty, don’t do it. Save your money.< /text>

< Review>
Incredible customer service and prices. Robert was my service advisor and he was knowledgeable and attentive beyond my expectations. Great facility where professional work is done. This is not a shop that is trying to get customers in, take as much money as possible and get them out. In fact I would guess they are taking losses at times just to build loyalty with their customers. I will be back!</Review>

The manager Oscar is a great guy he makes sure you are taken care off. We take all our cars to be serviced there. The reason I couldn't give them 5 stars is because of the wait time.<//Review>

So I brought my car in for some suspension work along with a alignment and tire rotation. I get my car back and noticed they never did the tire rotation. I spent close to a grand that day. Now I have to go back once again to get something done that they were supposed to do and forgot. No charge but time consuming....< /Text>

Wonderful service!~
This was the easiest experience I've ever had with anything to do with cars.
Les was very kind and precise, even giving a ballpark on the price so I knew what to expect. Turned out to be less than guesstimated, which was very nice for me.

After a nightmare experience of being scammed by a towing company and missing three days of work, this experience made up for it tenfold.

Thank you guys! - I didn't catch everyone's name, but I believe I also spoke with Oscar on the phone who was also very friendly and helpful.

Keep up the good customer service and efficient work!~ :]< /review>

They told me that they don't fix tires (which made me mad because what's the point of having a service center when you're not going to provide service) but that they're connected with Bud's Tire and Wheel. So I called they said they could fix it but they just had to order it. So I went and by the time I got there my tire had already arrived! The whole process took about only an hour. I'm so glad because I thought I was going to be carless but no they saved my car. Experience with CarMax -100 but with Bud's 5 out of 5. I really recommend coming here.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80dcb0ec1a7ecfc5:0xe150725abc1acc17</gmap_id><response>{'time': 1555995739341, 'text': 'What a great story!

<Pics>None</Pics><text>I went in because my low tire pressure light had come on several times during the current and previous week.  I had put air in the tires and the light kept coming on so I thought it was time to get new tires.  I went in to Bud's just after they opened, expecting to have to replace all four tires.  It was busy but I was seen by a very nice gentleman who was bi-lingual English/Spanish and he took my keys and said he would be back with me shortly after he took a look at my tires.  It was less than 10 minutes and he came over to me in the waiting area and told me everything was fine and my tires were in good shape it was the unusually cold weather that was affecting the warning light.  He adjusted the light and sent me on my way with no charge.  I was prepared to spend several hundred dollars and wouldn't have questioned it.  THAT IS EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE AND TRUST!!!

I lived in Riverside before moving to Arizona. I had to return the day after Christmas to bring my mother home for her funeral. I had always used Buds for my car. On my arrival I had a flat tire and naturally went to Buds. On a busy day he got me in and out and on time for the funeral without charge. Such good people.< /text>

Bought 8 tires from them. When you get a nail it will take 2 hours for them to serve you. Buy from Tucker Tire in Orange County you will be seen in 20 min for a nail even if they are busy. It is about customer service after I buy the product, so that I keep coming back.<//review>

I recently took my son's 1998 Chevy Blazer in for service, it needed a lot of work and we didn't have a lot of money to spend.  I was very thankful that his salesmen went over the things I could wait on and what work I needed to be done now.  His staff is honest and very friendly every time I am there.  It is nice to see that there are businesses like this that still exist, they are very rare!< /text>

< Review>
My cars hub got damaged so i went to my KIA dealership to buy the part. I then asked how much it would be to have someone put it on, they told me it would be 65 dollars! That's how much i paid for the part!

Being a female that's not knowledgeable in cars at all, i called various (13 to be exact) shops in the Corona/Norco/Riverside area and they were all telling me they'd charge me 35-50 dollars. Finally i just searched for the nearest Tire Shop that came up and Bud's came up. At this point i was willing to pay whatever. It was my first time there but the man who helped me out treated me like i had been coming there for years. I was treated with such respect, not a moment passed where i felt like an idiot for not even knowing what the part was called (he let me know it was the hubcap). He took it to the shop and had me pull my car up. Within 5 minutes the mechanic and him had it on. He didn't even charge me. My experience at this shop was amazing. It feels great knowing I have a reliable, affordable place i can go to for my car tires needs. The staff and atmosphere of Bud's is definitely top quality. I can't wait to let all my family and friends,  (especially all my non car-savy females) know about Bud's! Thank you so much!< /Review>

<review>Contrary to Mr. Taylor De La Ossa's review, I wish to differ.  I had shopped around for the best deal as I am a retiree.  Bud, not only matched the lowest price I was able to find, paid the out of state freight, and gave me a senior discount.  He went the extra mile.  if he sold dresses, my wife would shop at Bud's instead of Nordtroms.</review><Gmap_id>0x80dcb0ec1a7ecfc5:0xe150725abc1acc17< /Gmap_id><pics>None</pics><username>Rod Ballance< /username></record>

<Date>1440458957036<//Date><Review>Brought my 2005 jeep liberty in for a full synthetic oil change and tire rotation the price was fair. I live just across the street so I dropped it off in the morning and walked home.    I also asked them to inspect the vehicle from top to bottom as my warranty on my vehicle was about to come to an end soon. I never received a call from them to pick up my vehicle  and had to call them several hours later to make sure my car was ready. When I arrived there was no one being helped at the counter and still waited 5 minutes before someone even said anything to me. When I finally got helped the buds associate rang me up and handed me my receipt with the suggested maintenance. It had the suggested maintenance  services from my previous visit that I had already taken care of. I asked him about it and mentioned to him if these things where still wrong with my car. He said they must have not updated there system. I was still concerned and asked if they found anything wrong with my vehicle this visit and he said no. So he handed me my keys and when I got in my jeep I noticed the little sticker that reminds me of my next service had the date and milage of my visit and not the suggested milage for my next vist. I really wanted to like buds tires as they are right across the street from me but I felt the service was not good enough to keep me coming back and I would rather drive down the street for good service.< /Review><name>RAUL LOPEZ<//name><resp>{'time': 1441139767850, 'text': 'Raul - Please give me a call, I would like to discuss this matter with you further.

Use to be my goto, esp for car washes as well, they take no liability for any damages even though they pretend too. I blame corporate more than store but still, I dont trust my business here after 10 years.</Text>

This place always stocks up, in the beginning of the month to sell cigarettes by the carton at the cheapest price in town. Staff is always Pleasant and greet you as soon as you walk in. Make sure you start your own KickBack card account. You can use the KickBack card to get further discount at this location.</text>

The staff are unfriendly and the prices are higher than their competition right next door. The area in the store is very small so it is awkward when waiting to be helped.< /text>

I've always put gas and bought plenty of food in the store.. but on a hot day in sun city when some employees tell us if we have a cup we can get ice but a couple of employees want to charge... I think this is highly unfair not knowing from one day to the next if we can get ice.. I also think it's absurd that she would rather have me dump it back out into the sink and then the other employee telling her it's ok in spanish assuming I don't know how to speak spanish... and rude as she can be she still says " NO"</review>

Friendly staff. Great job on windshield. You will just have to wait a few days it can be a week before it gets fixed.< /Text>

<Time>1620078212622<//Time><rating>1<//rating><Text>I am very disappointed with Jackson glass. I had them out to look at a window for one of my units on my property because we use them as a vendor and never heard back. After 3 weeks of waiting to hear back (maybe the parts were taking awhile) I called them. Five times I had a young lady pick up and I explained the situation. I got the same answer “someone will get back to you.” That was 2 months ago and I have still yet to hear back from anyone. So, I called Cox glass and they got it done in 2 weeks. Communication is key, I would have rather had them call and say we don’t have time or we don’t want to do it... something would’ve been nice.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<text>The installed my windows quickly and promptly.  As well as the cheapest rates.  Everyone wanted to charge for custom windows.  I dont have custom windows.  Super generic.  I got an honest bid and good work.  Will use them again.< /text>< gmap_id>

Straight forward and honest, can't ask for much more these days. My experience with Chris the installer was  fantastic.</review>< pictures>

<review>Very helpful and accommodating. Needed glass panels cut for my cabinet doors. Not only did they do it while I waited,  but when I brought them back to be cut down to the correct size,  due to my impressive lack of measuring skills,  they did so free of charge. It's clear that Jackson's Glass takes pride in providing a premium service to their customers. They are the gold standard!</review>< pics>

Great company to work with for all of your glass needs. Home or auto glass services, this is definitely where we go. They made us replacement screens for our house and the fit perfect and very reasonably priced. Great people.< /Review>

One of their technician came out last Monday on 4/23 to get the measurements and to get the window type and before leaving the technician had advised me someone will call me sometime Tuesday or Wednesday of last week to provide a more accurate estimates to see if we would like to proceed with the replacement or not. No one has called me to provide an estimates as I was told. (FYI- I did asked the technician if I should call in to follow up on the quote in the next couple of days but he had assured me that someone will reach out to me.)<//Text>

I will never again have Jackson Glass in my home. I had my property stolen. I reached out to the owner of a Jackson Glass twice and has not called me back. The employer was his son. I am astonished someone would come into my home and steal medications.< /Text>

<Name>Yesenia Flores</Name>< Review>
I have never liked the extra charge they have, I was once hooked on this thrift store but I started adding up how much the extra charge was taking away from me for free & I stopped for years coming here. Until recently w the pandemic I started coming again. Prices are okay when it comes to toys household simple stuff like that. But the clothes seems a little over priced.  Associates there are whatever not much hospitality. You can find some good finds here & there.</Review>

But if you don't mind checking it out on a daily, weekly, or just spur of the moment you might be surprised at what you might find! I'm only telling you because I have too much stuff and I need people to buy it before I do!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Some items are a bit overpriced and on top your purchase they add a 10% surcharge (???)  they say it's to keep prices down, but who knows , at least they post it that notice on the door so that you will not be surprised when you  pay (and of course sales tax is added).  They have a do not have  daily 50% off color tags however on Friday's they have 2 colors 1/2 off , remember the 10% sub charge addition though.<//Text>

🚦🚦🚦Pay close attention, if you purchase any type of furnitures in this place and you don't have a big car to take them home they will charge you if you pick it up the next day. I got a dining table here for $149.91 surcharge was 14.99. Taxes 16.90 in total was  $181.80. I'm not adding what i paid to take it home. I couldn't take it the same day because i had to work at 5:00p.m to 2:00a.m. a Saturday, Now i have my doubts about the dining table if it is  worthy or not!! Another point here is that these places get  all this stuff for free and they already know that life in California is expensive and they over charged you? If they have some selected items at a low price it is beacuse they have been there for over three weeks so they need to get rid off of all that junk! People who says that these people are friendly probably are friends because i did not see no smile from them or a thank you for spending $181.80🙄</Text>

Got some jeans that were $4.29 and once I went to pay, it went up to $5.29?? They said besides taxes, they charge a surcharge fee? What is this? I just see it as a dollar of tax which is way too much for an item priced $4. St Vincent de paul has the best prices and all prices are flat with no tax or fees, dont come here, just go to st vincent.<//review>

Marty's Hobbies was a recent discovery for me, and an absolute gem. If you're into RC anything head there.  There are indoor 1/10th and 1/24th scale tracks as well as a carpeted buggy/truck course! The people are phenomenal. Truly. I've never had so much helpful advice from enthusiasts themselves. From purchasing something to working on your rig, they're the best around!</review>

I was new to RC cars and they set me up with the best options for my 6 year old son. I ended up buying 2 complete setups and even was ready to spend way more money but was housed on the best product for our needs. The Traxxas Slash RC truck was recommended and explained and I picked up 2 of them and all the necessary items to go along with it. So now I’ve got the parts that generally need replacing to keep my boy happy and having fun and I may or may not enjoy it myself 😉 I highly recommend Marty’ Hobbies to anyone</review>< Pics>

I'm giving this 5 stars. Even though I stopped in just to have a look at inventory and general atmosphere, the first impression was great. Some customers were being helped when I got there and didn't want to alter their experience so, i decided to come back later with an issue I have with my R/C truck that needs a resolution soon. Will continue this review after my next experience<//review>

I recently bought a UDR from them and I ended up misplacing the battery tray cover so I went back to them to buy a new one sadly the part didn’t come with the elbow screw that operates the locking mechanism so I talk to one of the nice most helpful guys and he ended up making me a custom one free of charge I cannot recommend them enough to anyone new or experienced in the hobby...to go to theses guys!!!!!👍</Review>

<review>I'm an RC Rock Crawler/Trail/monster truck rig guy for over 33 years.
Marty's hasn't been there 33+ years but they have a huge selection of crawler rigs that are ready-to-run(RTR). They have a huge selection of replacement parts , from Axial to Traxxas including aftermarket parts like SSD, RC4WD and Pro-line(among others), soft lexan and hardbodies. The staff are hobbiest so they are knowledgeable on what they have.....or I wouldn't drive nearly two hours to get there.
You could easily spend several hours playing on their indoor trail/rock course.
They have fast stuff for carpet racing, bashing and trains and flying stuff. I'm not into that so I can't tell you how extensive that part is.
But if you love trail/rock rigs and monster trucks like I do...this is an awesome place. If they don't have it , they will get it.<//review>< username>

The worst customer service ever. Do not recommend this place at all due to the fact that we went in asking for help because our RC car had a malfunction and they decided to call us literally liars in our faces and say we were the problem because they only “sell the best” . And not just once but multiple times.<//review>

<Review>This hobby store is terrible. First i called and got some guy who was giving one word answers to my questions as if he did not care what i was inquiring about. So i figured maybe he was having a bad day or something. I drove down there and walked in, NO one acknowledged me, not even a greeting. Which makes a customer feel unwelcome. After walking around for 5-6 mins i walked up to the counter and finally someone asked me “how can i help you”. I asked him my questions and he told me that the models would be in the same area i was just at. He gave me no helpful information at all. All the employees were behind the counter chatting to them selves, i heard one of them cussing and another one asked to go home early. Are you serious?! This place is so unprofessional and they dont care about their customers at all. This was a terrible experience and i will not be back. Dont even bother with these guys.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Best hobby shop I've come across because they have a great inventory that you get to look through and enough staff to help you find what you need. Online can never compare to holding the item!</Text>

<Text>GREAT PLACE!!! Has a great selection of rc cars, to planes to trains, while focusing on rc cars, i went in to buy a part for my car, and had a really nice dude fix it, and the service was free, also they had a mini track so i could do a bit of racing with my mini t 2.0, they also had a crawling track, i couldn't use it but it looked amazing, maybe 100 feet ++ of crawling track with test driving and great terrain!! really recommend going here for fun, checking out some rc's and driving!!!</Text>< Gmap_id>

Marty's Hobbies new location has more space, even enough to accommodate several indoor race courses! I was delighted to fly on an indoor quadcopter course, and even though I crashed up on the wall somehow, the staff was happy to rescue my quad. Alex gave me the grand tour of the new shop, which has even more inventory than before. In the future I would like to build a quad that can carry a GoPro, and Alex is just the guy to help me find the parts that I need. Their expertise is not limited to RC, they have hobby supplies that can't be found anywhere else. With something for everyone, this shop is definitely a place worth checking out.</Text>

My dad lives in Thousand Oaks and I live in SantaCruz. We do not have a brick and mortar store here and going to San Jose is not fun.
I visit my dad every month and looked online and decided to stop by here. Well worth it . Top notch customer service and every one down to the young guys were very good at answering questions. The price was only a few dollars higher than online and well worth it for all the info. After a talk they also told me to let them know if I need any parts and they would ship them up to me. This place is well worth ever cent and every moment you spend here...... Great job guys,...< /review><username>jeff POLARA<//username></record>

Decent selection relative to the size of shop.  Good selection of parts for R/C planes, helis, multi-rotors, cars / trucks and also model supply including trains.  Downside is, just like every small business local hobby shop now, it is completely unrealistic to consider buying anything here unless you need it the same day or sooner.  Prices are up to ten times that of the comparable online retailer, even with shipping or next day delivery.  You would only be buying something here in an emergency or if you just don't know any better.  That being said, it is nice that there is still a hobby shop of this type anywhere around, this is one of the last left within fifty miles.  Staff is moderately friendly.</text>

Cool store. Very helpful staff. Had some custom cables made in about 15 minutes. They went above and beyond your normal customer service.< /Text>

Terrible customer service! I only gave them two stars because ONE employee was actually helpful, i cant recall his name but he said he used to race for team associated. - This guy went the extra mile to help me, excellent advice and really did the research to get me the correct parts. Not only that but i found out he was suppose to be clocked out by that time! Personally working retail I understood and said "its alright, dont worry about it" - He CONTINUED to search for my part and made sure it fit before I purchased, then even placed my  order for the rest of the parts I needed! (he also commented to another employee how he was suppose to be off a about 30 minutes ago, and the other employee continued to stand there doing nothing - i almost feel bad for the guy considering he has to deal with such lazy coworkers)

Now once he left everything went to hell, I tried asking another employee for a spur gear and his INSTANT reponse was a rude "i dont know i dont know ANYTHING about cars" so I ask where there might be spur gears, again i get "i dont know, i dont know anything about rc cars i only do helicopters" Alright....so i ask to see the user manual for an associated car and without hesitation he reply's "we dont have the manual for that" which is odd because I used it in there store about 3 weeks prior.

If you truely know nothing about RC cars, why are you there? you could use that down time you were just complaining about to learn about the rc cars. Which begs the question; how have you worked there for such a long time and not know about rc cars? such a ridiculous excuse not help customers its pathetic.

It seems to me like these guys have never worked a different job and have no idea how to opperate a  store. Did I mention there were probably 4-5 people talking behind closed doors in the back of the store when there was about 7-8 customers looking for items?< /review>

I bought a transmitter that they didn’t have in stock for the losi 5ive t about a year ago the day we bought it they said it would take a week we have them my phone number so they could call us a month and a half later we go to the store and ask if they have it yet but they still don’t have it and ask for our phone number again now it’s been several months and they don’t have and haven’t called the least they could have done would be call us and tell us they don’t have it and give our money back< /text>

<Name>L P<//Name><text>very disappointing and not good customer service.. When i finally got there my pictures were not ready , bigger size wasn't available, frame had just one left that was way too much money low quality, and then i asked about items displayed and the rude lady said with a attitude & eyes rolling its not for sale cuz the lady who sells them is not working today. Needless to say I will not be wasting anymore of my money or time at this place and I highly suggest to not go here theres plenty other places with much better service, good quality and worth your time & money.<//text><pics>None<//pics><gmap_id>0x80c2cb6e8edcaacd:0xeb537a7100b9c4bf</gmap_id>< rating>

<review>Place is filled with tons of quality pictures. Different themes, backgrounds, music, and videos. The studio room is large. Workers are very patient with newborns and babies. I highly recommend them.</review>< time>

I came here multiple times & been very satisfied great pictures! This was my favorite place for pictures... but this last time was horrible! I recently took Easter pictures & I didn't like anything at all. Their service wasn't the best! The Easter pictures where super simple. Didn't add any nice decorations what so ever. Also the person who was helping me was a bit rude & careless. I told her my 3 month old baby wasn't able to sit down & she didn't care she still brought a chair to sit him down on his own. Had no type of patience & didn't put any effort. She was in such a hurry & didn't even have people waiting. I'm super disappointed!</review>

Everything is fresh and perfect. 9/10 times you get a great waiter too, but 4 you get one who is not really concerned with the guest experience. I think it may have been because I was there with my partner and two kids. He seemed somewhat anti-kid. My kiddos are total foodies and were looking forward to a 1st class experience and it was a bit disappointing.</Review>< pics>

< Review>
Excellent meal at this cozy neighborhood favorite. My husband and I shared an appetizer of grilled calamari with white beans and arugula. Very fresh tasting and the lemony dressing was perfect. We shared the delectable Sardinian pasta with various shellfish  for the second course, followed by the melt-in-your mouth braised beef short ribs. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the wines. We left it in his capable hands to pair a wine by the glass for each course.  We love to try new restaurants but both agreed we need to dine at this local standout more often!< /Review>

<text>My family had a terrific experience ordering delivery. All the instructions were followed correctly and the food was great. It was also great how they provided sides of freshly grated parmesan cheese for each entre. The bread was also excellent, normally I find bread from Italian restaurants is pretty forgettable but that was not the case here. I also enjoyed their unusual variations dishes that I haven't seen in other Italian restaurants. I will definitely be back.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>We ate there early in the evening and challenged the kid friendly reputation with our two year old twin grandsons. The kids split the braised short ribs and the gnocchi.  They loved it.  Two people had the pork chop and it was big wonderful and perfectly cooked. I had the calamari app and it was also fabulous and flavorful.

The service was warm, friendly and skilled.  It was a lovely dinner.  A great place to have so near where our daughter lives.

We’ve been going to Bacco for years. The food is consistently delicious, especially the rigatoni. The risotto is the best in town. The owner and staff work hard and deliver excellent service. We’ve brought many friends here and they’ve all loved it. It’s truly a great neighborhood restaurant.<//Review>

Amazing food always, and also convenient to be so close to our home.

Lamb shank, Rigatoni, and most likely everything on the menu that we tried were fabulous.</text>

italian food, mmm, so good. Service is always super even when they have a full house. The service was very helpful and welcoming. The bill was fair for the quality of the food. This place has many good reviews for a reason.< /Text>

This was our first visit to Bacco, but we will definitely be back soon. Wonderfully sparse decor is contrasted by beautifully plated and absolutely delicious dishes. Mario was knowledge and fun, and gave special attention to our gluten sensitivities.< /review>

<user>101580676906619213372< /user>< Review>
I had a very pleasant experience. The food was very exceptional. Having spent some time in Italy myself (and having to eat out for every meal), I confidently found that the authenticity was unquestionable and very delicious. Another comment here mentioned octopus, which I had as an appetizer. If there was something I had to recommend in particular from my meal, this would surely be it.

I was also very pleased by the service. This was personally the second time I've been here — first time being when I was probably in diapers when it just opened...so I was pretty much a new customer again. It was evident that there are returning customers, yet my table was given the same friendly and dedicated service as everyone else. We had constant communication and acknowledgement from the waiter and passing staff. The food tasted and was prepared in an upscale fashion, but the service was family-esque. Very complete restaurant, plan to go back.< /Review>

Incredibly underwhelmed with this experience. I ordered take out over the phone and was quoted 20 minutes. I got there on time, was greeted after standing for a couple minutes. They asked me what name the order was under but I hadn't been asked for a name. The server disappeared for a moment, walked back out and didn't say anything to me. After another 5 minutes, a woman came out, said it would be a moment and then left. Another 10 minutes later and I finally got rung up, and the food was out in another 5. Total of 20 minutes of waiting. The woman I placed the order with most certainly forgot to put it in to the kitchen and didn't just explain the mistake and apologize. It was not busy enough for a 40 minute wait time to feel justified. There was little communication about my order and it overall felt pretentious and like I was not worth their time. The food was mediocre at best, I ordered the Ravioli and at the price of $21, I feel like I could have made better at home. The side of bread I was given was stale. Who the hell serves stale bread? According to the other reviews, the bread usually comes with a pesto dipping sauce for it. Never got any. I should have just taken the drive and gone to Spiazzo Ristorante in West Portal. Won't be coming back here again.<//Text>

A great neighborhood restaurant.  Always reliable Italian dishes.  We ate at Bacco again tonight, and the waiter could tell we wanted a quick dinner.  We were in and out in 35 minutes with a great meal.  Rigatoni, Gnocchi, Ravoli dishes have all been very good on various visits.  And the olive oil they provide with the bread is an excellent (and free!) starter.  The food and service isn't quite 5 star, but it's close.  Definitely recommended.< /text>

Two people, no wine and it was almost $75 before tip. The room is really nice and airy with calm lighting. The service is excellent. It's a step up from most of the neighborhood places in Noe Valley.< /Review>< Pictures>

There's a decent selection of gluten free pasta and bread. Actually the pasta dishes are superior in taste compared with other entrees. The staff was very kind and even brought to the table plates and forks to share a cake that we brought for a friend.< /Text>

<user_name>L Lee< /user_name><review>Nicely decorated, good food but a little put off with slightly cold reception when my party first arrived.  Felt host was more concerned with Caucasian patrons than us (minority).  Waiter was a little abrupt when we tried to give him a count of how many cups of coffee we wanted, he preferred to count for himself.  The thing is, the whole restaurant experience also includes the type of service you get from the employee/owner. It's always nice when the host greets you warmly. So these comments have nothing to do with the food. The three stars reflex the attitudes of the employees.  For $76 a person serving 6 people, they should be nicer.</review><time>1513835970790< /time></record></dataset><record>

You can't beat the combination of food, service, atmosphere, neighborhood, ...and did I say food?  If you don't get the Sacchetto, or Brasato, or Rigatoni, you're really missing out. Oh, and the risotto and fish specials are usually fantastic.  Great Italian wine list too.  Obviously, I love this place.< /text>

I did not add tip, because my bill was so high, it was clear on the receipt.They fraudulently added a tip. I had the proof for the bank, thank goodness
The service was lousy & my meal was awful.< /Text>

<Text>An out-of-the-way gem!  Tables far enough apart that you don't feel like you're at a baseball game.  Unusual menu items such as octopus (luscious!) and baccala (as good as the maitre d's grandmother used to make it).  An array of pasta dishes to suit a wide range of tastes.  Recommend the panna cotta and apple pastry dessert (similar to tarte tatin).  Modest-sized portions.  Professional, unobtrusive service.  An oasis in the urban bustle.</Text><userid>110641335753794331561<//userid><name>Paul Minton</name>< rating>

Came here for brunch and Flores + Sons did not disappoint.  Owner/Manager was friendly and really accommodating to baby needs even though the F+S is more like a bar/bistro setup.  Bottomless mimosa was a great touch, but the Trout and eggs really shine.  I did not expect to see the 2 full size fillet on the plate with the sunny side up eggs, it was delicious.<//Review>

Otherwise it can be pretty frustrating).
Please go to their happy hour. All of their appetizers are delicious. Yes, order the fried corn on the cob, they won't disappoint!
Mmm-mm -mm. The
wafflefries, meatballs, side salad, all on the happy hour menu, are delicious. The entree's were very, very good as well (per my girlfriends because I accidentally filled up on appetizers :) They had the Trout and Fried Chicken, it all looked amazing and there was no doggie bags taken. I love the outdoor seating. They have heating lamps(we didn't need them) and a nice bird cage firepit that gave the atmosphere a really cool vibe. It's located on a street that that's pretty bustling with other restaurants,small stores and lots of people, makes it fun to walk off some food. We celebrated a birthday and the chocolate brownie is outstanding, but please share, it's super dense.<//text>< Rate>

Came for happy hour fried chicken. Was 9 dollars for 3 small peices. Good crunch on it but the flavor was pretty bland. I wpuld have honestly prefered 9 dollars of KFC.

The oysters were only a couple dollars each, though, and very large, so that was a decent value.

Prices are all pretty out of proportion from most every other restaurant on Sawtelle so I can't recommend it to locals in the area when there are 10 less expensive, better options within a block.</review>

Love establishments that give you a water the second you walk in and sit down. Literally the gentleman behind the bar asked how I was and before I finished the word 'wonderful' there it was. Not only do they give you a water - they give you a bloody jug of water. 5* right there. Furthermore, I don't want to say the cheese fries I had were the best I've ever had ever, but the cheese fries I had may have been the best I've ever had ever. Such a nice lovely variety of flavors.
Cool staff. Cool vibe. And I stumbled across this place cos I fancied a cheeky pint before dinner - love when that happens.
Will certainly come back.<//Text>

<text>I had been wanting to check this place out for a while. Very nice on the inside. I'm not sure if it was because it was Dine LA week but the food was pretty terrible all around. Service was slow and no one came by to pick up our dishes so we set them on another table to make room for our entrees. Probably one of the worst meals I've had in a while. Not worth the $100 tab for 2 people (including food and drink each).< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

DON’T COME HERE!!! They served me alcoholic drink when I ordered an Arnold Palmer. When asking the waitress why it’s alcoholic, the waitress simply denied it without apologizing. Later she replaced my drink, and it tasted so different. I asked why it tasted different, and she said ok maybe the bar made a mistake and DID NOT USE A CLEAN GLASS! She said the restaurant would never do that on purpose as if that solves the problem. Not apologetic. Not sympathetic with my medical conditions. Terrible service.<//Text>

However, I deduct a point for value during non-happy hour times. Their portions are a bit small for a bigger price. It's delicious, but it's hard to justify $20 dinners for smaller plates. If you can make it to happy hour (run, don't walk, because it ends early), then I highly recommend their fried chicken with a craft beer.</review>< pictures>

Came here for lunch and was promptly seated outside.  After that, service was good to a bit slow, as has been noted in other reviews.  As I write this, I've been waiting about 5 minutes for them to take my check.  Come on guys, I want to give you money and free up a table.

I ordered the potato rolls appetizer and chicken and biscuit sandwich.  The former were very tasty, yet overpriced at 4 dinner rolls for $6.  The chicken and biscuit sounded like it would be a sandwich, however there was so much chicken that it was effectively 2 open face sandwiches.  I had one and carried out the other.  The sandwich was very tasty, as was the side salad.

I'd come here again, just not if I'm in a rush.<//review>

<review>I'm so glad I finally made it to Flores  - I've been wanting to check this place out for ages!  I met 3 old co-workers for lunch.

First of all, if you're going for lunch, go early or just park at the public parking 1/4 of a mile up the street and walk it.  Parking was a nightmare and I spent an extra 15 mins just trying to find a spot on a random street.  Happy to say that I didn't even get a ticket!

Food: I had the chicken and biscuit and it was delicious.  The chicken was fried nicely, the biscuit was perfection, and there was a spicy mayo and a sweet/spicy honey on it.  Delicious!  The fries are thicker and seasoned really well.

The service was great.  It took a very long time to get the food and our server apologized multiple times and comped us a desert.  So, while I would have loved to have had a quicker lunch the server totally made up for it with great table side service.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

I've eaten at Flores and Sons for several different occasions and have had the pleasure of dining indoors and on both of the outside patios.   The ambience in each setting is as pleasant and cozy as the food is delicious.  It's the perfect place for intimate meals or social gatherings with a great bar and wine selection, terrific food, and affable attentive service.  Plenty of healthy, exciting and tasty choices on the menu in generous portions.  Thank you Flores and Sons for a delicious, fun and relaxing eatery!<//Text>

Went for dineLA. They serve full size of each item, so the total portion is huge. The mushroom pasta is too plain for me. I thought they did not cook pasta in salty water, so the sauce and noodle did come together very well. For the burger, ordered medium and served as well down. Cheese fries was awesome.< /Text>

Wonderful food and ambiance! I got the flores cheeseburger, which I was delighted with. The burger was cooked perfectly and the fries were wonderful. Had a few bites of my friends' foods as well, and was very pleased.

Great place, great service, and would recommend to anyone for a bougie but affordable place to eat!</text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

The first time we went, my husband and I were blown away by the avocado toast and bacon.
The second time, service was slow and my husband wasn't as impressed by the omelette, but I liked my hash ok.
We're now standing outside because I insisted on bringing our family from out of town for breakfast before they fly out, but it's been 10 minutes since opening (20 minutes of us waiting outside) and the staff have continued to ignore us through the window. The door is locked. I really want to like Flores and Sons but after today I don't think we'll be coming back.<//review>

<text>Service was horrible. We were in a large group, but that's not an excuse to wait over an hour to get our entree orders. Also most of the food items we did receive were overpriced for how good they were. Several members of my group also didn't receive their food until most of us were done eating. The patio had a nice ambience, but I don't think I'll be going back here based on how poor the service was and the mediocre food. Only thing that really tasted great was the pappardelle pasta. Mussels were cold (as opposed to steamed) and little to no meat (all stuck to the shell). The dinner rolls seemed like they were stale. The burrata was nothing special. Overall not worth your time and money.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Pics>None<//Pics><review>HRMM. I was curious about Flores since they opened on Sawtelle, a decidedly non-Japanese eatery and with such a curious name! Finally made it here on a Friday night around 8:45pm. We were seated right away on the patio.

FOOD:
We were so looking forward to the soft shell crab sandwich but they no longer had it on the menu! Sadness.
- baked hen egg - this was pretty good! Kinda like a hash, but no potatoes, there were thick chunks of ham in it as well.
- sausage stuffed quail - SALTY. The quail was very easy to cut in half, and chock full of sausage, which made it all salty! The stuffing underneath kinda absorbed some oil from the chicken - I didn't eat it.
- papardelle with braised rabbit - this was my favorite dish. The papardelle noodles were SO GOOD! So wide and thick, cooked perfectly and not too saucy. The rabbit itself was super lean and kinda chewy.

SERVICE:
SLOW. I think we sat for about 10 minutes before we were greeted by our server. The guy who brought us our food was friendly and nice, I liked him but our server wasn't very friendly, didn't introduce himself and was hard to flag down.

VENUE/PARKING:
Place is cute, with indoor and outdoor patio seating. Their heat lamps work amazingly well! Bathrooms are single stall per gender, and are VERY dim. Street parking wasn't too hard to find. I think they have valet for $7.< /review><gmap_id>0x80c2bb74e4bd4295:0x13a7954fa61f6520</gmap_id>< rate>

Noticed on my bank statement that the server added extra $ onto their tip when running my credit card. Manager did not apologize, and offered to send me a check for the difference rather than put it back on my credit card because it would be "too big of a hassle" to do that. Not coming back. Appallingly poor management and customer service. The food was mostly good, but the fettuccine dish was so bland it needed a bunch of salt.<//Text>

I stopped by to see if they had a full length mirror and found it within seconds of entering the store! It is exactly what I was looking for. Also picked up a few books while I was there. Love this place! 😀< /Review>

It was so hard to choose which set I wanted. Vic and his wife were very helpful!! Even recommended a less expensive stroller because it was a better brand for me. I even lucked out because of the Spring sale!! I'm very excited and highly recommend!!< /Text>

Like some kind of curator or buyer? Even though I consulted the SA website and phoned ahead to make sure all items I carefully loaded into my car and personally delivered were acceptable donations, the attendant rejected most of my items because he determined "they had enough of those items already." Really? So rude and unthankful for my time and effort to support the organization and those in need. I will not go there again, only to be turned away. Goodwill is unfortunately the same. Attendants have the ultimate say, and what is acceptable or not is completely subjective per the individual on duty. The attendant's policies were completely inconsistent with website information and with management answering the phones at the Family Store. DISAPPOINTING!< /Review>< gmap_id>

< Review>
I called ahead and asked if they took hangers and the man said they do. When I went to drop them off the man from the phone conversation said to go to the back where the donation center is. Upon getting to the back I encountered the rudest man I’ve ever met. He said immediately they don’t take hangers. I explained to him that he should let the man that works for them in the front that so they don’t give people the wrong information. He kept rudely saying they don’t take them, they never have. And I explained again that I understand and they should let the employees know. To which he replied, “you must’ve talked to the wrong person.” Rude, rude, rude. All he had to do was say that he’d tell the man THAT WORKS FOR HIM not to give out wrong information to people and waste a trip.< /Review>

<text>How can I check my bag in if there’s no one around to check my bag in? I came into try to find some practical all black shoes for work & had even asked, “do I check my bag in?”. Getting no response I proceeded to look for shoes & then was told by a worker upstairs that I had to check my bag in. Well why not check my bag in then? If you’re too busy, I’ll just go elsewhere, as I had waited for a while at the desk & even asked very loudly “so, where do I check my bag in?”. “Hello?”. The people are generally snobby every time I’ve come here, so I’ve only come by once a year or so. Apparently it doesn’t matter who works here, as I’m sure their worker turnover rate is pretty high, maybe the job just sucks so much that they have to take it out on other people. Whatever the case may be, this place sucks! Goodwill is way better! I only stopped here because it was on the way to another store. Otherwise I never waste my time, & I shouldn’t have done so this time either!  But, good luck to anyone else who goes here!lol</text>< time>

<text>I shop here a lot and I always find treasures.  Inventory really moves here because it's a popular place so I stop in all the time to see what's new.  The sales people are helpful and very nice.  It's my favorite place to hunt up vintage items.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>I would've given this place zero star. This is supposed to be a Christian store, but most of the staff are anything but that. They are rude, disrespectful and nasty in person and on the phone. When Marlena was the manager things weren't as bad. Now that she has either left or retired a few years, it's even worse.

For example my phone call to them a few minutes ago prompted me to make this review years in the making. I called asking what sale they were having. The man who answered just said, "fifty percent," and hung up on me.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< rate>

While their prices are great, the staff is extremely rude. I've been in several times after work, and when I'm dressed nicely in a button down, they say nothing about my backpack. Today I went in wearing some leggings and look a little raged (from jetlag) and I was treated like a theif while simply trying on shoes.

Don't really feel inclined to shop there anymore and honestly don't think the business has long left anyway.< /Text>

<Review>Fair prices, on sometimes surprisingly, high-quality, used(and also new, but previously owned) merchandise of all varieties. Check it out. Other services,  besides the Thrift Store, available as well. Such as voucher program participation, etc.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Ridiculously overpriced stuff. The clothes aren't sorted by size, so a lot of digging and luck is required. They are only open from 10AM till 6 PM which kinda sucks as well. Probably one of the worst thrift stores in SF. I did manage to find one nice shirt though.<//Text><resp>None<//resp><rating>2<//rating>< userid>

Pretty decent collection of furniture and knick knacks but the prices are outrageously high for a thrift shop (ALL Salvation Army stores have become insanely expensive) but you never know, you can luck out.  Free parking is in the back of the store and you can bring your donations there too, during business hours.</text>

And what I like about this shop is that they always make sure that they display the new ones, not the old stocks! I really like this grocery shop located near our place because they offer a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables!  Highly recommended especially if you are looking for fresh goods!<//Text>

If you want high-quality products at a reasonable price, this is the place to go. It also has a wide selection of new items that aren't normally available on store shelves. It's an excellent decision! This is, in my opinion, the best grocery store in the neighborhood.< /Text>

Although slightly pricier than your usual grocer, one definitely feels the difference in service, stock and availability. I happily frequent the store and my experience has been very satisfying.</review>

This review is for the sushi at Gelsons in Hyperion. I must have been standing at the sushi counter for 5 minutes waiting for the chef to notice or even a hello. I guess that’s asking a lot now a days. Anyway, brought my rolls home and I’ve never had smellier and old stale fish in my life. Not sure why he would let someone buy this, let alone at Gelsons. I’d never buy sushi from here again. Bad attitude, service, and disgusting fish.<//text>

I was dressed casual. 1st bad experience when I ask to use the restroom to wash my hands. I was looked up and down. Then begrudgingly she told me where it was. Then the cashier rudely spoke ill about my husband & I with another customer about the drink that I had brought from another store essentially accusing me of stealing it. I was so upset I spoke to the cashier and a supervisor. I never thought profiling was such a big deal until it happened to me. I am so disgusted with Gelson's staff. Had it not been for the staff in the catering/deli area & some items I can not find elsewhere I would never go back.</text>< pics>

Overall great store. My only issue was that I couldnt find a specific item no matter how many people I asked. I walked around the store for about 10 min with 4 different people giving me 4 different aisles. Asked a manager if someone could walk me to it, he said he'd never heard of it and so they don't carry this item. I explained I'm picking it up for someone who buys it here often. Just shrugged, "I don't know what to tell you, I've only been here two days and were very understaffed today".

Finally while looking on my own, an employee walked down the aisle, I asked him and he went straight to it, it was even covered by other items in front of it (why I couldn't see it) and he just moved stuff out of the way because he knew the exact location. It shouldn't be this hard, bad experience but otherwise a good store.</Text>

they have an ATM here (wells fargo) but more importantly, they have a bakery that has cookies, cakes, macarons, etc. while their macaron variety is not huge, they have a wide range of pastries that will suit any occasion. also their macarons are $1.95 which is half a dollar less than boba time (but boba time has more.variety). i tried the pistachio macarons which were delicious! gelson's bakery staff is polite and talented! i will be stopping by any gelsons for them from now on :D</Review>

Gelson’s is the best shopping experience you can find in the Los Angeles area. The shopper feels this from the time they first walk in the store. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The meats and veggies are the best money can buy and the selection has everything a capitalist society should have. It will cost you a little bit more but it is money well spent.<//Review>

gelson’s is my everything fancy grocery store. the prices are fairer than vons or jon’s or those other chains that pretend to be economic. and their aisles are filled with treasures - they have candied fruit during christmas, proper bakeware for thanksgiving. probably introduced me to kumatos. the prices aren’t a dream but when trader joe’s doesn’t have something i know i can find perfect quality specimen at fair price from gelsons.<//text>

This was the biggest supermarket in town! I used to shop here every time I need to purchase stocks for the whole week. Everything I needed was already in this supermarket. I always had a convenient time shopping here.< /review>

Maybe it's just me, but the staff doesn't seem too friendly to newbies in the area. It's a really nice store with a wide variety of specialty items and in-store freshly prepared items. High end in quality with prices to match.< /Review>

This store makes me love grocery shopping.  I find things here I can't find anywhere else.  The prices are great, and the free coffee and tasting station are so welcome.  If you love flowers and plants, the selection is great, and the prices are even better.</review>

Terrible experience. A staff member named Celi was throwing my objects around on the scanner and had a terrible attitude. Very rude for a cashier damaged one of my items and when I mentioned she became even more rude. Not really a great rep for customer service.

The covid entrance line guard just got upset and called us all children because a customer made a mistake and entered when he left his guard, but only as patrons came out.

Totally in called for. He should apologize. His name is Robert.< /text>

Very clean store with helpful staff. The parking lot is conveniently designed. Just be careful to not be in a hurry when you shop here because the cashiers' hospitatily results in a time-inefficient pace (i.e., you can't have both a personal touch and a speedy business).< /Review>

Who knew this Gelson’s Supermarket had a Wine and Beer bar inside? I didn’t... came for bananas and nuts and walked out practically having a wine tasting. Got home and no bananas and nuts. I’ll have to return tomorrow for them. While there I had the Impossible Burger. OMG, for a plant-based burger it was really, really good. Comes with chips and a beer, I upgraded for a Booch Craft. Totally worth it. The bartender Otto is super friendly and offers spectacular customer service. Lots of regulars visit this location. Immediately as they walk in, Otto is already getting their drink ready. Great idea Gelson’s. Place is clean and neat. Will definitely visit again.< /Text>

Once one of my favorite markets, the renovation a few years back seems to have diminished Gelson's appeal. Surely that's not what renovations are made to do, and there are some positive outcomes including the improved cheese section and more space in several areas. Something about the new color/lighting makes it feel like you've been transported to a medical clinic in the 1970's. The prices, as ever, are terribly high. There used to be some competition as to whether Gelson's or Whole Foods would more quickly drain my bank account, but Gelson's has very clearly pulled ahead. Gelson's also seems to have a habit of banishing some of my favorite products (some that I could only find at Gelson's) from its shelves...likely due to a matter of the store's limited footprint, but annoying nevertheless. Considering they have less of what I want, and are charging horrendous prices for stuff I can easily find elsewhere, my visits here have become fewer and far between. One bright spot: They still have the best deli department anywhere, with wonderful and friendly staff behind the counter. My favorite irrepressible redhead knows who she is, but they're all a pleasure, and, in fact, earn Gelson's an extra star on their own.</text>

Gelson's is the nicest, most upscale grocery store in the neighborhood. I tend to go to all of them for different things. They've been in the neighborhood the longest, they're very well established, but recently they've moved detnized and upgraded. Gelson's has the best produce, the most extensive selection of most items. They have a huge selection of wine and beer, they have a really nice bakery, and even a wine and beer bar with live music during happy hours. They have a very nice food bar/salad bar.< /Review>

<text>The people here are friendly, and the products are upscale, the sales are good - but there are so many expired products on the shelves. Make sure to check the expiration date of whatever you buy. Over the past six months I have bought meat, cookies, coffee (over a year old), juice and dairy that were all expired. It's my fault for not checking the expiration date at the store, but for the prices being charged, they should be able to stock items that are not expired.</text><Response>{'time': 1561732389490, 'text': 'John-Henry, thank you for reaching out about this.

<Text>Great deli department. Some things are overpriced, but that's the reputation. The produce for one, is expensive, but you get what you pay for; it's generally excellent. Only the wealthiest shoppers can afford the meat department prices, and I'm sure it's also very good- I wouldn't know lol. Certain staples are competitively priced, cleaning products, paper products, etc., but it's good to know what other places charge if economy is important to you. For most people who shop there it's not.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Review>I love this store. Familiarize yourself with the inventory and the products. I have coffee and  a roll here for six bucks.  Lunch. Soup or sandwich for under ten dollars.  Wine specials are good. Wine tasting. The help here is awesome. Many of them have been here for twenty years.  A good local alternative to other high end groceries.</Review></record>

It's WAY overpriced and has rude
cashier's.  Felt judged for paying with my change. Prices are at least double if not triple a normal grocery store and selection is worse although they have decent food you will pay for it and feel ripped off.  Highly recommend going across the street to Trader Joe's even if it's busy the employees are really nice and efficient.  They have just as good if not better quality choices for reasonable prices.  Avoid Gelson's unless you don't mind literally spending $90 for one bag of groceries.  I thought Whole foods was expensive but this place has the most inflated prices I've ever seen!<//text>

Calm & kind are the managers at our more spendy local market. But hey, when you need your ground Peet's Coffee, it's the go-to. So what if shelves are empty? Head for good stuff: a stinky creamy blue frommage. Pourqui pas? Try it on a Wasa cracker since all the other crispy square vessels are sold out. Getting creative in the appetizer department to focus on staying sane, Comrades<//Review>

It's WAY overpriced and has rude
cashier's.  Felt judged for paying with my change. Prices are at least double if not triple a normal grocery store and selection is worse although they have decent food you will pay for it and feel ripped off.  Highly recommend going across the street to Trader Joe's even if it's busy the employees are really nice and efficient.  They have just as good if not better quality choices for reasonable prices.  Avoid Gelson's unless you don't mind literally spending $90 for one bag of groceries.  I thought Whole foods was expensive but this place has the most inflated prices I've ever seen!< /text>

< Review>
Our visit to Gelson's Market was great. We normally always have a good experience. Gelson's Market is a nice clean store. Today my son accidentally knocked a salsa jar over causing it to break. The employees were more than willing to clean it up. I recommend Gelson's Market so much that I drive there from Los Angeles.</Review>

The Gentrification Grocery Store.

Prices inflated so the less fortunate are deterred from shopping here.

The clientele is the huffy puffy type of person who snears in line when you attempt to use a coupon, God forbid if you have to put an item back, you will watch the entire check-out eye-roll you.

Tomatoes cost $4 each, I have photos to prove it.

Avoid this shop like the plague unless you're secretly racist, or have a physical allergy towards the poor.

We will be conducting decency tests into this location, and will advertise the results.

Walk across the street and just deal with the line at TJs. You'll save $$$$</text>

<review>All of the Gelson's Markets are excellent, but this particular store is the best of the best.  Well stocked, impeccably clean, very helpful staff, top notch produce and meats.  Meat counter is not quite like your corner store specialty butcher, but very close.  It is certainly a high end market and everything is top quality ... a little more expensive than a other markets, but you get what you pay for.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

The product is typically very good. It is also typically very expensive, but folks know that going in. It's definitely a different clientele here from an average food market. The parking lot at rush hour here is an exercise in frustration and serves up large helpings of rude and inconciderate drivers. It unfortunately affects the experience of shopping here.  The sushi is really very good, and is the reason that we return.</text>

<Text>This is a good store. Clean, friendly staff, always helpful,and lots of food choices in the hot food/deli area. Also there's a bar inside.   The only thing that is not always good is the parking. People whipping around the lot, tight parking spaces, and people driving the wrong way. Have almost gotten hit twice. Watch out for those driving poorly here. Go slow always!</Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Overpriced but they have some items I can’t find anywhere else.  A waste of money for everyday shopping.

Update.  In response to the owner/manager.  Yes Gelson's has great quality goods but many items are more expensive than Whole Foods.  I stand by what I said.   A waste of money for everyday shopping.</Review>

<Review>Five stars for the amazing shopping experience. Sure everything is priced a bit more here, but this Gelsons is super clean, the staff is super nice and the shoppers are super hot. The ladies at the deli are so cool and always willing to share ideas and so knowledgable.  Love them so much. I come here when I just can't deal with crowds or aggressive parking lots. Seriously the entire experience at this grocery store is like no other in LA.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80c2c0c9717c7611:0xcb7955d32cf97226</gmap_id></record>

<Date>1523363281735< /Date><review>Had lunch on Taco Tuesday. The tacos were Excellent!!! The corn tortillas have no preservatives and are very very tasty. I had the chicken and carne asada tacos. The meat was so juicy and had a great taste. The salsas were also very good. I was pleasantly surprised that the tacos were sooo good!! It's definitely a spot to try when in downtown LA on a Tuesday.< /review></record>

< review>
BECAUSE PRICES ARE MUCH HIGHER ON NEARLY EVERY ITEM THAN ANY OTHER MARKET.. I AM GIVING 4 STARS..OTHERWISE 5 STARS IT WOULD BE. OK...This IS my neighborhood market now and has been for many years. This market is impeccably clean, well stocked, superbly managed and customer service is superior! The prices do reflect the quality of merchandise..you will NOT see empty spaces on these shelves for more than 3 mins.! Like produce..yes. It is expensive but I have NEVER tasted a sweeter ear of corn or better bigger Bing cherries. This market caters to an area that houses the likes of very high profile celebrities.. TV personalities, actors from box office blockbusters (say that fast 3 times!) to local news anchors. THEY HAVE MONEY TO BUY THE BEST..AND IT'S HERE!! If you want to do your weekly shopping here, you should be able to spend up to 9 bucks for a PINT of the best ice cream and $16-25 (free range) for an average size chicken . I'm not wealthy AT ALL..but I do treat myself on the excellent sushi, deli and baked goods pretty regularly!  Prepare for POSSIBLE parking issues between 5 and 7 pm. THERE IS AMPLE PARKING..95% of the time.  Otherwise..Albertsons is not too far away.  Some staff have been at Gelsons (was Mayfair) for at least 20-25 years. Most I've known 17+ years .. still very friendly! Photos coming soon.. Right here!</review>

<Text>Cooks in Deli section become "clever"- how to outfox customers. Bought today 1 piece of "fried iceland cod" fish. Which is $16.00 per each pound. Brought home, craving for good experience. Guess what- NO !!! More then halph of the piece - heavy CASC, made of flour and some gooey substance. When you open the casc- inside- small, tiny piece fish it self. So most of the weight comes from steaky flour. But customer pay $16 per pound, not for the fried fish, but for -viscous undercook DOUGH!!!< /Text>< Pics>

Gelson's advertisements crack me up because they usually have about 5 items on special sale (whereas regular grocery stores have 5 page ads) but weirdly, their organic milk is always the best priced. Take that for what it's worth.<//review>

I really like the supermarket, it's just a little pricy for my taste. Can't fault the produce and the service though! I'm particularly a fan of their deli and cheese sections!< /Review>
