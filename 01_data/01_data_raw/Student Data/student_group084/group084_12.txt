<review>This is THE best place we ate at on our entire San Diego trip. Don't let its outward appearance fool you, that food is tasty. I cleared my entire plate. The staff was super friendly and even suggested some other places for us tourists to check out. Excellent selection of fish, and cooked to perfection.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Now we are kicking ourselves that we didn't come sooner. The options you have when you come here are incredible. The quality of fish, the taste, and the overall experience are amazing. You cannot go wrong here (I personally recommend the lemon dill butter on grilled fish or the tempura fish and chips with horseradish tarter sauce).< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>It is a quaint little place, but their selection of fish is what brought me in. I had their fish & chips with Alaskan cod...best fish & chips I've had in the US. Neither needed anything put on them, but the plate included a double-horseradish tartar sauce that was awesome (avoid if you don't like horseradish though). Even though you order from a counter, the staff is friendly and really take care of you. I would definitely come here again.< /Review>< Pics>

Do yourself and anyone else you care about a favour and shoot on down to Coronado. Our grilled fish plates Cod for myself and Sea Bass for my partner were perfect size and perfect selection of vegetables. Service was regardless of whether we had just stepped in from the beach or not. Thanks guys. You will not be forgotten. You are welcome in Australia any time</text>< Gmap_id>

<text>Service was decent.

However the food was TERRIBLE... I ordered the swordfish plate and spent $25 thinking I was spending too much but I'm so close to the ocean and the fish must be THAT good, right? NO! The swordfish plate was served to me on a paper plate with the driest piece of fish I've ever eaten.

This is my first review I've written ever. I want people to know that this place is a waste of time and money so you too don't think you're getting a 4/5 star reviewed restaurant like I thought I was.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Friendly service. Yummy food. Awesome location.

Attending a seminar in San Diego, my wife and I had a brief lunch break. Look, we get to stare at the Ohio River all year. So, instead of hanging around the hotel and conference room any longer, we made a dash to Coronado.

Maybe it's not big deal for the locals, but us mid-westerners need to gobble up ocean views whenever we can!

And, we needed to gobble up some viddles. So, my wife pulls out Yelp on the way, and we the safe bet - go with the highest rated restaurant on Coronado ... there's a reason why.

It was Sunday afternoon. The weather wasn't great, a bit cloudy, so the Islander wasn't slammed. But, we were greeted by a wonderful hostess/waitress, who was extremely friendly. First, she told me I didn't need to pay the meter (which I had missed), then, she knew we were in a hurry and got our fish and chips order in right away. While it was getting ready, she prepped us to go with to go cups and the bill.

When the food came out, the chef (owner?), gave us a pro tip and said, "hey, it's fried. The sooner you open these styrofoam containers, the better it will be." Now, I should know that after years of takeout, but what a friendly and thoughtful tip! This guys was saying, "my food is really good. Here's how to get the most out of it if you are getting it to go."

And, it was delicious! The curry ketchup on the fries ... awesome! My wife hates ketchup, and she gobbled it all up. The horeradish tartar sauce, yum! The cod was fantastic and the pumpkin seed slaw great on the side.

A little pricey for what we normally pay ... but, that comes with the territory on Coronado. If you're going to pay premium, get the best. Go to the Islander!< /review>

The food was alright, and the service was good. The fish was a little bit under-cooked, though.<//Text>

Unfortunately, this park was quite dated with very little to offer.  There was a homeless man napping on the bench... for me is not usually a problem but it was the closest bench to the play ground. This discouraged me from venturing farther from my daughter in order to sit while she played. There was on the other hand plenty of space to run.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><user>115903063453702589945</user><user_name>emma cane<//user_name><date>1576364007491< /date>< rate>

Great place if you ignore what appear to be drug deals happening in the bathroom area, the fights between the homeless living there or any other potentially dangerous situation from the people occupying the place. Definitely do not let your kids near the bathroom area or in the bathrooms, I can not imagine there is any measure of safety in them. Regardless of what anyone is saying, there is a thriving level people who reside here and simply come right back every time the city removes them or their garbage. Again, the bathrooms cannot be safe. Not sure why the city does t simply demolish and remove the bathrooms and the old pool area.</text>

Lots of street parking, tidy play area, shaded grassy areas. The usual Modesto homeless visitors. When the bathrooms are unlocked you may find someone's possessions strewn around.

I would take children to the play area but NOT the bathrooms.<//Review>

Beautiful park, nice grass, has aplay structure we didn't use, but a dad and his kids were enjoying it. We played hackey on the bball court. Bathrooms were locked, no drinking fountains. Presumably so that people who don't own or rent a home can't relieve themselves in the privacy of a restroom with a toilet or wash their hands in a sink when finished. Probably no fountains so that same said people don't have access to water as this might make drug use, hygiene or laundry too easy. But at least everyone else who walks their dogs have plenty of grass for them to deficate upon. Why not have bathrooms for kids/parents and separate ones for adults.</text>

This is a good park to take kids for a nice time. Besides swings and a small play are, there is an unique play area that the kids really enjoyed climbing on and sliding down. There is also a basketball court and a large grassy area that the kids can run around and kick a ball. It's well maintained and sits in a residential area with lots of parking around it. We will visit again. The only thing I did not like, no doors on the bathroom stalls.</review>

Great park, except you can't let you young children run around. Homeless drug addicts lurking in the shadows.  If you go here stay vigilant.</review>

<Review>Lovely service; the chef came out several times personally to check on our meal.  Our waiter was relatively attentive and refilled side dishes and beverages briskly.

Tteokbokki was only so-so, will likely try a pajun next time.

Galbi jjim was delicious though; loved how they cut the beef to get more sauce on the surfaces.  Tendon pieces were unexpected, but flavorful.
Galbi sauce was great consistency and went well with the purple rice.   Would have appreciated more quantity though.

Outdoor dining is not recommended for a date night.  Area is a little noisy, boarded-up apartment windows are visible, and the fence may need some mending.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIUvH-90mCqWwhiYzJ2_HyJZikV909pELd-3X-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

This place is just awesome. The food was excellent. Portions very generous. Presentation made you feel at home. Plenty of different dishes to choose from the menu. The staff super professional and knowledgeable.   Definitely one of the best Korean restaurants in town hands down.</Review>

We tried "Better than Cioppino BTS" and were very satisfied. The dish was rich in flavor, generous portion with plenty of seafood and beef tendons. The owner added in tteokbokki for us and we enjoyed the dish so much. Also they had delicious side dishes, especially the mashed potato (the best I ever had). This spot is on our list now and will come back more to enjoy all the dishes on menu.<//Text>< Pics>

< Review>
New Korean restaurant among many Korean restaurants. Place is clean and newly designed. Staff are great. The side dishes s good but not the the best I had. The seafood pancake is great . The bibimbap is good but cold hoped it was served on a hot pot or hot plate like the other food< /Review>

< review>
Been local since 70's and many Korean restaurants but this one is clean, genuine Korean touch cuisine. Lots of special dishes and Beef Rib with chunky veggies.
Now with Silla Style Steak, slow cooked to reduced the fat, comes with fusion Curry and Spicy thin noodle.<//review>

Hankering for some ethnic Korean food? Treat yourself today to one of San Jose's finest and order some foods here. Their galbi is something else....unreal!! The bibimbab here is carefully crafted, the egg perfectly poached, the traditional bowl..exactly like the experience you'd have in South Korea but right here in Silicon. You will also want to try their tasty seafood pancakes for appetizers and their sweet drinks that they offer to complement your dishes. Enjoy!< /Text>

<review>A seemingly limited menu, not sure if it's just because of their soft opening but they have everything you would want. Good portion sizes and very reasonable prices. Their small dishes are good, their kitchen was working out the kinks on some dishes and so some people went a long time without food, but the staff was apologetic to the table next to us. I would go back for sure, hope they keep their quality and their service up.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNictGm0ANqW9kLB4Z61iFhFdaubb6jr-kJzz7-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjELZq9jhg_bjraEckPDDOc9qh9AflP2IngaO1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAvsQhccUeb5TxJKdkHNZ5_rjl-gOgBCSbXqnd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x808fcb4ecf295819:0xb612a2c5c34e538d<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>Two friends and I were starving and went here for outside dining on a Saturday evening. This place did not disappoint!!! There was only one table outside on the back patio so I recommend calling ahead to make sure they can accommodate you and be prepared to do takeout.

The seafood scallion pancakes were delicious and great for sharing. Entrees have great portions and if you get service there, you might get free appetizers (kimchi, radish, small scoop of mashed potatoes, glass noodles). I will say the ambiance is not the best since the patio is kind of in the parking lot but the food more than makes up for it. Enjoy!<//Review>< Time>

Ordered BOGO from UberEats and it was terrible. They just made one portion and divided to two small container and selling as a BOGO and price was unbelievably high. very poor packaging, tastes, presentation was awful. I strongly recommend to go Churngdam or 10 Buchers if you want Korean food. This is not the place you want to spend money.<//Text>

<Review>The servers were very fast, kind and efficient. I was very pleased with the service. The jook was absolutely delicious in terms of consistency and flavor, I was really happy that I ordered it. The bibambap was also well prepared and overall I had a great experience here. The A/C was a bit cold in the spot where we sat, but the combination of the hot food and getting used to it made it not an issue.< /Review>< Pics>

The food here is really delicious and the environment is also really clean. People better make a reservation first before coming. It is crowded and the waiter is really busy even barely have time to sign up for walking in people. I recommend the beef rib soup. It is awesome. For the bossam, I actually think it is too expensive. It is also delicious but the size is too small for that cost. Over all, I will still recommend this place for those who want to have a delicious Korean food. I will definitely go there again.< /text>

The corn with mayo (we asked to hold the cheese sauce) that came with the grilled chicken and grilled beef dishes were a little strange for me. I'm not accustomed to having mayo without bread. Will be back again to try more of the menu, next time will have the Mrs drive, I want to try their wine offering and see how it pairs with the food.< /Review>< pics>

A bit pricey but clean restaurant. Had the grilled fish and taste was ok. I think you get more for value at places like Jang Su Jang. Overall not too bad but little too expensive compared to other Korean restaurants on El Camino.< /Text>

Kid starving wife melting down, still no contact or reassurance. Rude and pretentious staff. Favoritism running rampant. I don’t care if they make water taste like wine this place sucks!

<Review>(Translated by Google) Galbi tang. Fried beef meat. Grilled mackerel. We sell single food such as land wares. There is no smoke and it is clean. Staff are friendly. It's just the taste of food.

(Original)
갈비탕. 오삼불고기. 고등어구이. 육전 등의 단품 음식을 판매합니다. 연기가 없어서 그런지 깔끔합니다. 직원분들이 친절핮니다. 음식맛은 그냥 그래요.<//Review><username>seunggeol Baek< /username>< pictures>

The man named Chang who runs the place is rude. Very bad service makes you wait a long time. Also very defensive with pricing. Acts like he doesn't want your business when you're trying to price match or compare. Never going back to this place again. Worst customer service I experienced.</Text>

That why I write this rewiew it take a lot to get me to put a 1 star on anything or rwirte a negative review but this place shouldn't be in business !!
I was novice to growing indoors so came in hoping to get a little help instead my novice got me $2000  worth of stuff I can't used !! Plus the owner always so rude if u don't know go online he would say , it like ok I'll just go to another store that will answer my question not many !!

Overpriced crooks !Owner is rude and doesn't want to deal with you unless he can sucker you in to buying overpriced items . 20% restocking fee for returning something to shelf a three feet away and no credit towards purchase . Small akward isles you cant see items I'd rather pay more elsewhere than give that jerk a dime.</review>

<text>Joining DC Fitness has been awesome. Thank goodness I left Ballys. Everyone is super friendly and helpful. Miguel at the front desk always asks how my day is and Matt, the manager, has been very very helpful in getting me started. Also I love how they have variety of classes. Big thumbs up for being one block away from work!!< /text>< Pictures>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>I just completed the 6 week challenge with DC fitness. It was a total success - so I wanted to share my story to not only show appreciation for the program, but to also advise others others look to achieve their fitness goals.

Moving to LA a year and a half ago was difficult. It was a move I had to make, but the challenges that come with a cross country move took a toll on my mind and body.

2 months ago, I came across one of those Instagram ads about getting fit in 6 weeks. I was skeptical, but I needed to get fit. As a constant athlete growing up, I was not happy with where my body was at and needed a change. So I put the money down and was all in.

The program offers 3 main facets: Fitness, Nutrition, and Accountability.  Working out 3 times a week with the DC team ended up becoming some I looked forward to, rather that something I dreaded. This was because It was only a 45 minute-1 hour work out where I knew I would maximize my time. I was able to build great relationships with each trainer, who truly cared able my progress and success. I was surprised by how supportive all the other gym members were as well - but I guess that what happens when there is a mutual goal.

Stay true to the regiment this program lays out for you, and you will see results in 6 weeks. I recommend the challenge to anybody looking to improve their physical and mental health, through a challenge that provides all the necessary tools to succeed.

Great gym! Friendly staff and clientele, reasonable rates and extended hours - pretty much everything you could ask for.  I do wish they had things like complimentary towel service and such, but for the money I'm saving and the friendly atmosphere, I'm willing to sacrifice a bit.<//Text>

<text>This place is amazing and the absolute best price value in SF! Super high quality body pump instructors -- each with a unique style. I am a body pump convert! The results have been phenomenal and I owe it to Joe, Peggy, Erica, Maury, Brian and Megan!  If you're sitting on your sofa or at your desk with a bag of chips, you  must try this gym and body pump!< /text><userid>106325423448161415603</userid><user_name>Litzy Grimes< /user_name><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

I participated in Dylan's 6 week challenge at the beginning of May 2019 and lost 26.4 lbs & 7.5% body fat. This was the best $798 I ever spent on my body as I needed that push to finally get the body I've always wanted. Because I was able to pass his initial challenge, I got to keep and roll over the $798 for another 6 weeks of personalized meal plans and work out plans. Throughout this 12 weeks, Dylan helped remotely to keep me on track by motivating me with constructive criticism on my photos of my meal prep and body progress photos. I never received an in person work out session at his gym, that is extra so this program ultimately depends on you putting in the work. I could not afford to continue on with Dylan after the challenge with his plans as they were out of my price point significantly. . I wish there was more affordable plans available especially with at least one in person session at his facilities but if I get some extra disposable income down the road, I'll be back to check if he's got any special promos running. If you are serious to lose the weight and able to put some skin in the game, definitely worth the investment on yourself.<//review>

I just completed the 6 week challenge at DC fitness and I couldn’t be more impressed with my results. The trainers are awesome and kept me motivated. The diet plan was key in me losing weight and body fat and super easy to follow. Spencer, my accountability coach was checking in with me a few times each week and he really helped keep me on track! I lost 9 pounds and 6.1 percent body fat. I definitely recommend this gym. It’s a great community and will help you reach your goals fast!<//Review>

I love working out there because the trainers really push you in a friendly but rigorous way to go beyond your own self-imposed limitations. I gained muscle mass and for the first time in many years I got to see signs of my six pack. It's not a full blown six pack but I am very happy with my results. Nutrition plays a big role during this fitness challenge journey. A fat free diet is key when you are committed to your goal of getting lean, provided that is what works for you. For me it did. I am not a keto diet person so I could do fat free. The workouts are awesome, balanced, strong and I feel like a million bucks  every time I leave the gym. A lot of sweat, particularly on leg days. I get to see my arm muscles too, which I love. Dylan, thank you. DC Fitness rocks!!!< /review>< pictures>

<Text>I recently completed my 6 week challenge with DC fitness. Is losing 6% fat in 6 weeks possible? I wasn’t sure. By following the meal plans provided and attending 3 sessions per week, I managed to successfully finish my challenge. What is more important is that now I have established healthy habits that I can continue to follow. The trainers will push you hard enough to get the results, and they are friendly and helpful. If you are in doubt, I highly recommend that you would give DC Fitness a try. Thanks Dylan and his team for a life changing experience!< /Text><name>Hak Sung Cho<//name></record></dataset><record>

I just want to drop a shoutout to Alex Osborne as he is one of the best trainers I've had since I moved to the bay area. He has a way with his words to encourage and inspire you to push a little harder. That's what I appreciate most about him as a trainer and most importantly, as a friend.<//Text>

6-WEEK CHALLENGE FINISHED
This program is NO JOKE. With the help of the DC trainers and a lot of self control and hard work I was able to loose 25lbs and 7% body fat. I cannot recommend the team here more. The accountability coaching helps you stay on track every day and the workouts motivate you. Every person that I met along this journey was awesome and I look forward to continuing the relationships built here. Thank you so much to the DC that helped me make it happen. I can't speak more highly of DC Fitness and just know that if you stick to the program you will GET RESULTS!< /review>

<user_id>107778008014164616932< /user_id><Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>I was VERY skeptical coming into DC Fitness because the challenge sounded so difficult to do and maintain. What I found was a space where I was not judged, incredibly kind and encouraging trainers who cheered me on, and a diet plan that is logical and gave me options that had me dropping weight unlike any other plan I’d tried. I always thought I’d have to spend hours in the gym to get results, but it was really manageable. The program works and everyone is there to support you. You don’t have to show up dressed to impress like some other private gyms - no one is pretentious. When I fell off the wagon with my diet, the managers got me on track right away. Highly recommend, this is not a gimmick like I feared. It even dramatically improved my sleep, which was a crazy added benefit. If you put in the work here, you WILL see results!!< /Review><date>1581649444628</date>< username>

I recommend DC Fitness to anyone who:
- Wants to make positive change to their physical (and mental) health
- Wants to love to work out
- And might need a kick in the butt to do so :)

The team is a group of awesome, personable people who are great at what they do, and have a really fun time doing it. No negative pressure, good vibes only! I was honestly skeptical of the 6-week program at first, but my leap of faith was rewarded with a new good habit and a surprisingly good body :P During the 6 weeks I met my goal of 6% body fat loss! Thanks especially to Terrence and Brent who kept me honest, positive, and constantly pushing. <3 DC Fam!</review>

I've been training with DC Fitness | Personal Trainer Brentwood for the last few months and he's THE BEST. His approach, professionalism, personalization, and expertise are the only reason I'm still on this fitness journey. I just moved to SF and his training made me realize Fitness CA is more than just a gym, but really a community. All thanks to Alex.< /text>

<Review>I just completed the 6 week challenge and could not be happier with the results. I lost the 6% body fat (and then some) all thanks to the excellent training staff and accountability coaching at DC Fitness. The gym has an incredibly encouraging and accepting atmosphere and each of the trainers do a great job of meeting every individuals needs within each session. The accountability coaching was something that was new to me but really helped me achieve the results I was looking for. I highly recommend the gym and the challenge to anyone looking to jump start their fitness routine.< /Review>< Name>

I cannot recommend DC Fitness enough.

I started my diet and exercise plans 6 weeks ago and finished up this Wednesday weighing out 21.6lbs lighter and lost 8.1% body fat.  The support from Dylan and all the team was marvelous, always there to check in, help and keep me motivated.

I'm looking forward to seeing the benefits of my new 9 week fat burning and strength training push, and attending my classes each week.

Thank you to all the team and family for your support and encouragement.< /Text>

I was looking for a structured program that I could push myself physically and see real results by the end of it. The last 6 weeks have been challenging and required real commitment, but was totally worth it! The combination of the diet plan + the consistent workouts make a big impact. The trainers were great and encouraged me to get better each time. I was able to surpass my goal and hit an 8.2% loss in body fat! I would encourage anyone who's looking for a structured program to try it out! Huge shout out to Terrence and the rest of the team for all the support!</text>

Everyone, I do not exclude anyone, was very sincere loving and caring from the beginning! The attention I got was extraordinary, not to mention the nutritional plan I received, the sessions, and the positive feedback was exceptional! If you want somebody to help you with your goals in Fitness I definitely recommend DC Fitness! I lost 14 lbs and won the challenge and I could not have done it without their help! Once again thank you DC Fitness for being a part of my journey I appreciate and love each and everyone of you</text>

Everyone, both staff and folks at the gym, are positive, friendly, and encouraging.  That, paired with everyone's knowledge and the mid-workout laughter made this challenge more than I had hoped for. Big props to all the trainers and folks who are a part of the DC family. Y'all made this so much fun.  My trainer was Terrence, but they are all fantastic and I know I would be in great hands with any of them!

If you want to challenge yourself, have fun, and have the dedication to put towards this, definitely recommend.  They're a fantastic group of folks!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Review>DC Fitness is high quality. I loved the focus on the Nutritional side of the process. I did the six week challenge to get back to my high energy, athletic Broadway Dancer shape and I’m almost there. At 55 years young I lost 11.8 pounds and lots of inches. All this with an injured wrist and a sore back. Dylan even gave me alternate workouts to strengthen my area that were weak using bands when I could lift weights. I am super happy with the results. Take the challenge with Dylan at DC Fitness. You won’t be sorry!</Review>< Date>

<Review>What an amazing experience from start to finish. I had been trying for months to get into a groove and feel better about myself. I participated in the 6-week challenge with another coworker, and let me tell you...it works. The workouts were always great, the trainers were always attentive, and the DC family was always there to support you every step of the way. Over 20lbs down and 8% loss in body fat, I crushed all expectations beyond my imagination. DC Fitness isn't a quick way to lose weight but a great program for anyone needing that edge or the extra push to start seeing the results. My biggest issue was not fitting into my clothes and now I have the problem of needing new clothes...it's a good issue and an even better feeling. I cannot thank everyone enough.<//Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I participated in the 6 week body challenge at DC Fitness after seeing an ad for a local gym on Instagram.

I have nothing but good things to say about this gym. From Day 1 I felt the support of the awesome staff. Dylan laid out what I was to expect in the coming weeks. Right off that bat I was given a meal plan and online resources to get me up to snuff.

The 18 workouts start out as a kick in the face but really become enjoyable somewhere around week 2. The best part of this whole experience was the extremely supportive training staff. They all have different styles and approaches to workout classes which kills the monotony of a traditional gym routine.

I was easily able to gain 10lbs without upping my body fat % in a short amount of time.

Do your body and mind a favor and get to know this awesome gym and the people behind it.<//Review>

I decided to try a 6-week challenge and boy did it pay off. The moment I walked in, I felt right at home! Meeting with Dylan Conrad about some of the goals I wanted to reach and he was always positive and keeping me up to date on what I needed to do nutrition wise. Also, I had a wonderful Accountability coach in Sequoia, who always kept me motivated even on days I thought I could not push myself. I am proud to say my weight is 182.6!

The journey seemed a little intimidating but the DC Team are all great at being super supportive, uplifting, and there every step of the way. All the coaches are awesome, but I got to give special thanks to my accountability coach, Terrence. He’s just a true all star. Aside from the coaches, the OG’s/people on the challenge with you have your back just as much and having that comfortable yet driven community pumps great challenge crushing energy for everyone all around.

< Review>
At first when I came across the Dc fitness 6-week challenge I wasn't hesitant about the veracity of the results, I saw it as a big challenge on myself. From the moment I walked in I felt right about it, for me "customer service" has always been a big deal and the smallest thing from being greeted made me feel at ease.
A little about myself, I have always been passive about my fitness and have never seen myself as the type to do anything active, but for several reasons I needed to challenge myself. DC Fitness provided everything I needed to get to where i wanted to be and that is to be stronger. With the meal plan and coaching provided I was able to go from 31.9% to 25.2% body fat , and a 12lbs weight loss. I am so grateful to have found DC fitness because they were the catalysts for this momentous change f my life. I am so grateful for Ambra, Terrence, Brent and the whole crew at DC fitness, thank you for showing me how to have the right posture and technique, and for showing me how strong I can be!</Review>

<review>DC Fitness is amazing. I have been training here for a little over a year and the results I've seen are remarkable. Not only has my body physically changed but I feel a lot better about myself and have fun doing so. Dylan and his team are wonderful to work with and genuinely care about their clients' success... you get a program customized to your needs, nutrition coaching as well as great motivation along the way.

Highly recommend working out here. I look forward to it every time I go.</review></record>

<rating>5</rating><Text>I recently moved back to the West Side and was looking for a trainer to gain muscle and improve my health.  I was referred to Dylan Conrad and in just 3 weeks I've already seen remarkable results.  I've gained 7 pounds of lean muscle and my energy throughout the day has increased as well.

Dylan isn't just a trainer.  He is a personal fitness coach who teaches everything from the correct mechanics of exercises to proper nutrition and supplements intake.  He is very personable and tailors the program to fit the client's needs.

I would HIGHLY recommend Dylan to anyone that's looking to improve their life through physical fitness.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Text>I Signed up for the 6-week challenge at DC Fitness. The goal was to lose 20lbs in 6 weeks. You get challenging workouts with a trainer aimed at pushing your fitness level and change with your progress. A grocery list and meal plan catered to your weight and weight loss goal. I recently completed my challenge losing 28lbs and 3.5% body fat. Dylan and the staff are great. Everyone encourages each other, shares recipes and help each other out with questions. If you want to lose weight, build muscle and need a kick in the pants! I highly recommend DC fitness!< /Text><resp>None<//resp>< pictures>

It pushed me out of my comfort zone and I was held accountable with help from the trainers! The sense of community in this studio made me feel welcomed and kept me disciplined and I love all the friends I made! And not only am I much more confident, I know that I have the discipline to do whatever I want moving forward!< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>the 6 week challenge on facebook and decided to give it a try. I really wanted something to get me in shape quick for my upcoming trip to Europe in July. I met with Dylan and he explained the process very well and how everything worked. I decided to challenge myself and lose 5% body fat. I was given a meal plan and and will meet with a trainer 3 times a week.

The meal plan was very easy to follow and made me a little creative to come up with delicious meals and saved me some money too.

During the 6 weeks, I trained with Adam Damper. He is freaking awesome!! Great motivator, pushes you, and will crack some jokes along the way. Made the training session fun too.

In the end, I was able to lose 5.2% body and met my goal. I had a great experience with both Dylan and Adam. I feel and look great and gave some confidence too. If you're looking for a fast change, I recommend DC Fitness.</Text></record>

<Text>I found DC Fitness through their 6 week challenge. I have had such a great experience with them! From the trainers, to the other people at the gym, I have always felt encouraged to push myself and do the best I can. I've never been to a gym where I felt like I wasn't in competition with those around me, and that's exactly how I feel at DC. Each time I walk in everyone is so warm and welcoming and has made this journey such a memorable one. Thanks to DC I have built new fitness and eating habits, thanks to a little kick in the butt, and have made a significant amount of progress that I would not have otherwise!</Text></record></dataset><record>

Best gym I’ve been to! I started training with Dylan when I realized I needed to push myself to reach my body goals. I had lost weight a few years before, but plateaued and never really trained to gain muscle.

I weighted in for the 6 week body transformation challenge at 168.8lbs and 23.4% body fat.  My goal was to lose 20 lbs. Dylans meal plan was easy to follow and left room to make healthy meals that were also delicious.

For my 6 weeks , I trained with Adam and Emma, who both made the process worthwhile. Their training pushed me in every session in the best way possible.  Their humor, the 80’s music, and the ambiance of the gym made working out fun. Even when I wasn’t in the mood to train, I always left my sessions in a better mood.

After my 6 weeks training , I now weigh in at 146 and am down to 16% body fat, meaning I lost 22.2 pounds and 7 percent body fat , which is kinda insane.  This place is the real deal! I’m so excited to go forward with all Dylan, Adam, and Emma have taught me.<//Review>

Had a good experience at DC Fitness and hit my goal of losing 6% body fat (actually lost ~9%)! The trainers are knowledgeable and friendly and the semi-private sessions have a welcoming atmosphere. The fellow gym members are all encouraging and push each other to work harder. Great program to see immediate results.</review>

Been going here for 5 weeks on a semi-private class program (groups of 2-5 people). Lots of focus on strength training and they have an accountability coach guide you through eating plans and it really helps keep you on track to get the results you want. I'm really happy with my results and it's the system that works for me. Very clean facilities and knowledgeable trainers.</review>

<Text>I love DC Fitness.  I feel that they are constantly trying to improve their clients with new routines every month and tracking your results.  The atmosphere is fun, and everyone feels like family.  I have trained with DC Fitness for more than four years.  They have taken me through many phases in my training, from losing weight, getting stronger, and even an intentional bulking phase.  They do a lot of functional fitness techniques which have done a lot to correct my many imbalances and make me feel like I have a solid base to pursue my other athletic endeavors.  I always used their semi private training which helped keep the costs down.  I still felt like I was getting all the attention I needed.  I highly recommend them to anyone looking for personal training in West LA.< /Text>< Pics>

If you are ready to change, DC Fitness will get you the results you have been looking for. I lost 25 lbs and 6.4% body fat in just 6 weeks! To say I feel amazing is an understatement. Thanks to their incredible, knowledgeable trainers, my body is moving faster and easier than it has in years. Not only am I looking like the me I remember, I am feeling like her, too! Increased energy, confidence, and overall happiness, thanks to this program, facility, and it's amazing staff. I can never thank them enough for giving me this jump start, and look forward to continuing working to get the best body I've ever had!!< /Review>

Like many of the reviews on here, I came to DC Fitness through their 6 week challenge. Lose 20 pounds in 6 weeks? It seemed pretty insane. I've gone to gyms and worked out on my own before and the results weren't even close to anything I could call a transformation. But over 6 weeks I dropped 24 pounds, almost 7% body fat and feel like a new person.

The trainers are fantastic and will push you to succeed and reach new heights. They are also patient and will help you if you have awful form like me. They can adapt workouts to your needs and work around any injuries you may have. Even though I was pushed hard I never dreaded going to the gym which was surprising to me and a testament to them.

It wasn't easy. I changed my diet and put in a lot of work, but ultimately I wouldn't have seen the results I did without DC Fitness</review>

<Text>The owner Dylan is in my entrepreneurs group and referred me to a trainer here in Fresno. I was pretty impressed by the D.C. Fitness gym when I came to visit. Full length mirrors, lots of open space, and very clean. I talk with him often about my personal fitness goals and Dylan is very knowledgeable and cares so much about the health of others.

<review>The first week of July, I had to shop for new jeans because none of mine fit me anymore. Then I saw an ad from DC Fitness. Could I lose 6% body fat in 6 weeks? I held off on donating my old jeans and took the DC Fitness 6-week Challenge. With their program of meal plans, accountability coaching, and strength training, I surpassed what I thought was possible. I lost 19 lbs and 6.9% body fat. From where I started, I didn't think I had that much weight to lose. Now I am in the best shape of my life and I owe it all to their excellent coaches Brent, Terrance, and Cornelius. Thank you Dylan and Ambra for this amazing program. I feel like I can conquer anything now.</review><Time>1567018594743< /Time>< username>

DC Fitness is a fantastic training facility. I trained with Dylan back in 2013 for over 2 years and recently I visited the studio and trained with Larrell and Emma who were both really great to train with. The facility is clean and the gym equipment is kept in good condition. The workouts are versatile and during semi-private group training you typically wont have more than 2 or 3 people working out with you, which allows the trainer to divide his attention evenly among everyone. Dylan is extremely knowledgeable and knows his stuff when it comes to fitness. Definitely recommend this place!!<//Review>

GO TO THIS GYM. I cannot tell you how great these people are. Dylan, Adam and Emma coached me through an insane 6-week transformation that resulted in me losing 30 lbs and 11% body fat. They are attentive, caring and driven and inspire their clients to get the absolute most out of the workouts. This was one of the better decisions i have made in a long long time and i highly recommend you commit to it too.</review>

<text>I have been a client of Dylan Conrad Fitness for several years. I have utilized his services for several aspects of my fitness requirements, from specific sports conditioning, weight loss, and injury management and prevention.  Dylan has always adjusted my programs to meet my goals and keep it interesting. Programs are individually designed and changed every few weeks. Dylan also monitors his clients progress with periodic assessments including body composition analysis.
Dylan and his team are not pushy "drill sergeant " trainers. As a team they are firm and supportive without being pushy and loud. The studio is small but not cramped and his online scheduling is easy to maneuver. Dylan is committed and stays up to date on the latest in training and diet. I will continue to use him for any aspect of physical conditioning and highly recommend him and his company.< /text>< pictures>

I completed a six week challenge and I can't thank the team enough! I lost 6.5% body fat and toned a ton. I LOVE food so it definitely wasn't easy but with the support of the team and the consistent workouts and check ins, was able to complete my goal. I was always sore but excited for the next workout. I am an avid gym go-er so it was awesome to mix things up and have some direction. Thanks to The whole DC family!!< /text>

As a holistic nutritionist I really appreciate the amazing insight Dylan and his team at DC Fitness were able to give me when it came to finding the right exercise programme to compliment my healthy lifestyle. The team are very approachable and made me feel completely at ease. They are consistently encouraging, fun to work with and really helped me to achieve my fitness goals. Finding the right gym and trainers can be challenging but I can't recommend Dylan and his crew enough. They’re passionate about fitness and they’re results driven! If you’re looking for an amazing gym and first class trainers then look no further than DC Fitness :)<//Text>

I could not be happier that I joined this gym! Dylan and his trainers really have a vested interest in your own personal journey. They are kind, knowledgeable and are always adapting your workout/nutrition program based on your ability and your goals. Most importantly, I lost 15 pounds in just 6 short weeks with this gym! They've taught me that fitness and nutrition is really a lifestyle, and I can't wait to keep it up. Who could ask for more?</text>

< Review>
DC Fitness is amazing! I'm not the type to be diligent about working out, but DC Fitness finally got me there. Dylan, Emma, and Larrell are each excellent trainers that offer different points of view and a great time no matter what. My favorite thing about DC Fitness is that they've successfully created an environment in which people of all different fitness levels can exercise together in the same space without feeling a sense of competition. It's a wonderful little community that I'm happy to be a part of and I'm so grateful that they've made me a healthier, stronger person.< /Review>

Since they resonated with what was ailing me I signed up for the DC Fitness jump start program. I liked the intimacy of the studio, as big gyms have always been a turn off, and I loved the customized program. Before starting there was a body assessment and goals discussed. Given my schedule, I worked out with all three of the primary trainers and all were great. I was extremely happy at my one month assessment. Results were more than I expected. - fat percentage down 7%. I look forward to moving beyond the jump start program and seeing further results.<//Text>< userid>

I would always join the program again. Best training and meal plan I've ever had. I lost 29 lbs in 6 weeks. I trusted the program from day one. The trainers are super motivating and fun! Amazing and life changing experience!<//Text>

<Text>DC Fitness helped me transform my body when I didn't think that I could do it!  I had been trying to tone up and lose a few pounds for over a couple of years and I just didn't think that it was possible because I am on the petite side - 5'3" with a starting weight of 126.6 lbs.  The 6 week challenge kicked my butt and got me to my goal, i lost 7% body fat and 10 lbs!

The gym has a community feel to it and the trainers are all really kind, professional and motivational.   The workouts are great and I found myself getting stronger each week, trying heavier weights and feeling proud.

The diet is very doable, and they give you recipes that actually taste great.  With the help of that + Pinterest, eating became a breeze.

I definitely recommend this challenge and gym to people who are looking to reach a goal and are willing to put in the work.  Thank you DC Fitness!</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I've been training with DC Fitness now for about 3 months.  After moving to Santa Monica, I tried a few different training/exercise programs and I have to say I love what I've found at DC fitness - a customized training program with trainers who care about your individual progress and push you at every step to maximize effectiveness of an exercise while prioritizing proper form above all else.  I also like that there are new individualized programs every month based on my goals.

Dylan, Larrell and Emma are awesome!  I love the vibe they create at DC Fitness - just a great down to earth comfortable environment every time I'm in there.

Training at DC fitness 3 days a week for the past three months, I've seen great improvement in my strength, stamina and endurance.  I have more energy during my day and less aches and pains in my body. I look forward to seeing where my training will take me!

I highly recommend DC Fitness for anyone looking to make a real change in their body.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><username>Sneha Kulkarni<//username>< Rating>

<text>I can't speak highly enough about this gym! As a former athlete, I was looking for not only a place to get back in shape, but also a lifestyle to make it last. The atmosphere, trainers and workout plans are terrific. Supplemented with a nutrition plan and group atmosphere, I'm truly please with the results on and off the scale.

<text>DC Fitness is a great place to workout! I had the opportunity to be trained by Emma and Adam who are excellent trainers! The gym has a nice environment, it is clean, full of workout equipment and full of people who are super friendly and going towards similar goals as you. DC Fitness staff will always be motivating you to achieve your goal, complimenting your achievements, and helping you with any doubt you might have about meal plans and outside workout.
I started the 6-week challenge on April 19th. My weight was 127.4 lb and my body fat was at 32%. I was a little skeptical about the program and the fact that I had to lose 5% body fat in 6 weeks. Nevertheless, I committed and found myself at 117 lb and losing 6% body fat at the end of the challenge!</text><Resp>None< /Resp>< pictures>

<review>Dylan and his team offer a fantastic fitness option that really stands out in the super-saturated LA market. Everyone is extremely welcoming and knowledgeable, and you will always feel like you are getting their utmost personalized attention, right from the initial, full-body assessment that allows them to identify your areas of strength, weakness, and injury to create the perfect program for you. Whatever your fitness goals are, DC Fitness will absolutely help you reach them.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<text>Lucky to have happened upon DC Fitness on Instagram. After my consultation with Dylan & Ambra, I knew I was in great hands. The 6 Week Fitness challenge served as a reboot in how I approach my Fitness journey, which began back in Summer 2012.

Dylan and his team of consistent exceptional trainers, all of whom always offer specific, tailored modifications and form-corrections to all students in class, helped me achieve and surpass my goals - goals I was genuinely convinced were unattainable in 6 weeks. Nutrition-wise, Dylan offered me a meal plan that was a complete game-changer. I have always eaten healthy but Dylan offered specific modifications to help ensure I’d be able to achieve my goals.

After plateauing for about a year, after working with the DC team for just 6 weeks, I ended up winning my Fitness Challenge and lost 6 lbs of fat. It’s been about 2.5 weeks since I completed the challenge and not only have I been maintaining how lean I became, my body is still metabolizing and further burning—just in time for summer too!

Thanks all for an incredible time!< /text><time>1560212170271<//time><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Like many people, I have an extremely demanding and time-consuming job that eats up most of my day.  So I struggled with finding (and making) the time or effort to work out. Turns out my mental, physical and emotional health suffered as a result. And then I started training at DC Fitness… and everything changed.   From the very first time I spoke to Dylan Conrad and every workout since then, I have felt supported and encouraged by Dylan and his trainers.  Every workout is personally programmed with my goals in mind and the energy and vibes I feel when I walk into DC Fitness are only positive, fun and uplifting.  One of the best hours of my day is spent at DC Fitness sweating my butt off, accomplishing and surpassing my personal goals and laughing and having a good time along the way.  DC Fitness’ semi-personal training is the perfect combination of getting the benefits of my own workout program while also getting to work out alongside people who share the same goals of making healthier choices in the pursuit of becoming a better, happier version of ourselves. If you’re like me 5 months ago and you desperately need to take that first big step towards making an effective lifestyle change, training at DC Fitness is the best decision you have yet to make.</Text><rate>5< /rate>< user>

I want to express my gratitude to the wonderful trainers and Ambra for my transformative experience. I had could have used a number of excuses for not achieving my goals yet thanks to the trainers at DC Fitness I achieved incredible results. Devastated by a divorce I did not want, motorcycle accident, challenges of raising 2 small children, etc. I still lost over 25 pounds and continue to eat and exercise as prescribed. If I can do it, so can you!!!!<//Review>

Dylan is amazing trainer and really professional! As a yoga therapist, I've worked with quite a few trainers in the past and finding ones that are experienced is surprisingly challenging. The best part is the programming and tracking progress with assessment and metrics. Highly recommended!</text>

<text>You can tell a lot by a gym by its cleanliness. The place is ALWAYS spotless. The trainers are very knowledgeable and not "boot-campy" where they just stand over you and yell. The exercise programs the staff creates do this for the trainers. I get measured every 4 weeks with my body fat and have continued to see results. I recommend D.C. Fitness for anyone tired of doing a personal training program but not tracking whether or not they are seeing progress. 5 stars!</text>< Pics>

Most fun gym I've ever been a part of. The staff is amazing (obviously) and the atmosphere is like none other. If you are injured and looking to workout with hurting yourself this is the place for you. I suffer from neck and low back pain, and the team here at D.C.

<text>I found DC Fitness through an ad on Facebook, and thought I'd give it a try. It ended up being exactly what I needed, with an incredible group of trainers (shoutout to Terrence, Ezekiel, and Melvin) and a truly intimate and familial environment with amazing, challenging workouts. Through the workout program and diet plan I dropped more than half my body fat (14.4% to 7.1%) in six weeks, looking and feeling better than I ever have. I am so thankful to Dylan and the whole clan for setting me on a path of fitness and health that I hope to continue on for the rest of my life.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I’ve been going to DC Fitness for the past four months and have been extremely pleased.  The semi-private training sessions (max 3 people at a time) allow me to have enough personal attention, without breaking the bank.  The training regimens are personalized for each person, however, to match with your stated fitness goals.  Most of all, the trainers (Larrell and Emma) are both great – they’re the right balance of easy-going and positive, one the one hand, yet willing to push you enough to get results.<//Text>

The team at D.C. Fitness really helped me determine and stick with a plan to achieve my fitness goals.  It feels more like working out with friends than just going to a gym.  I also love that they focus on helping me get my form right as much as getting the weights in.  Dylan & his team have really created an environment where you instantly feel like you belong, no matter where you are in your fitness journey!< /review>

In just 6 weeks, I lost 12.8 pounds and 8.4% body fat!!!! With the right meal plan, semi-private strength training sessions, extra cardio training on my own, a lot of focus and dedication, I'm back to where I want to be in my physical self. Not only that, this program gave me a renewed spirit and reminded me that I can do anything I set my mind to. Thank you DC Fitness for helping me achieve my goals. It was a great challenge, a great experience, and I learned so much. Healthy eating and being active is a part of being happy to me. This challenge is not over! It's a lifelong challenge that I'm ready to face one day at a time.<//review>< Time>

DC Fitness is the BEST! From day one, Dylan and his trainers (special shout out to Larrell) have been so encouraging and supportive as I work towards my fitness goals. Originally, I was gifted 4 sessions from a friend and was nervous that this workout would be too intimidating for me. I liked it so much, I signed up for additional classes!! No matter what level you are, DC Fitness has a program right for you!< /Review>

I’ve been training with Dylan's team since moving back to LA last spring. It is far and away the best personal training experience I've ever had - Dylan cultivates an environment that is driven yet supportive and fun and completely positive. I've lost weight, grown stronger, and learned how to do interesting and challenging exercises. Also, the small group session approach provides the right level of attention at a great value.< /Text>

< Review>
DC Fitness is the absolute best! Dylan and his team totally know what's up when it comes to the workout world! Instead of feeling intimidated by the gym, they make the experience super comfortable, personalized and fun. Not to mention, it's a really tough workout. I have knee problems and can't do most workout classes, but since going to DC Fitness, I've never felt stronger!</Review>

Off the bat it’s clear that their goal is to help you become the best you, not get you in and out or set unrealistic goals.  Everyone is very personable, which – for someone that doesn’t particularly like working out – makes it a much more enjoyable experience.

My goals initially started at just getting healthy.  It had been a couple years of no exercise and terrible eating habits, so really just wanted to go slow and steady.  In about two months I started seeing noticeable results and lost over 10lbs, but most importantly I had way more energy and wasn’t feeling sluggish anymore.  About two months after that my clothes started fitting completely different, and exercise wasn’t feeling like a chore, but rather something I enjoyed.

I really recommend checking out DC Fitness, Dylan and everyone are knowledgeable, personable and understand everyone’s needs and goals are different, and that a “one size fits all” program doesn’t work.</review>< resp>

<Text>This place is awesome. It is so refreshing to have a trainer who actually cares about the person's functional strength. I am a local chiropractor, and I have worked with Dylan and his trainers for my patient's rehab.

I cannot say enough good things about them! Not only do they understand fitness, but they understand function so are totally safe while training, but your workouts will help you in your daily life. They have helped a number of my patients get out of pain faster and stay better longer!

Keep up the good work!</Text>< Response>

<text>I was a little trepidatious about returning to the gym (let alone a boutique gym), and the folks at DC Fitness have not only made it less intimidating, they've been great at providing encouragement and helping me to stretch ever so much further to accomplish my goals.

The trainers are skilled, other clients are likewise supportive, and the team overall has done a great job in creating welcoming environment.  Regardless of what your fitness goals are, I would recommend DC Fitness- you should give them a try or take them up on a challenge/discounted trial before looking elsewhere.</text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
The fitness environment at DC Fitness is great. The semi-private classes are small, everyone is friendly, and they give me the direct attention I need. I fall into the category of people who thought they were getting a good workout in while doing it on my own. That all changed when I was given a fitness plan and motivation by the DC trainers while in their facility. The intensity of my workouts elevated and I learned that I can perform activities well beyond the limits that I had set. You will monitor your progress by getting periodic check-ins to review your levels, those kept me motivated to eat healthy during the weeks as well as continue my fitness plan. Overall 5 stars and worth taking the plunge at any stage you may be in life.</review>

When I first joined DC Fitness, I was totally intimidated. I've never worked out as hard as I have in the classes, but the instructors Brent, Cornelius and Terrence were so supportive, enthusiastic, and motivating, I kept going and completed the challenge! I've always struggled with my weight, so when I starting losing body fat, and not as much weight, Ambra calculated and explained how much fat I was actually losing, and muscle I was gaining, and I was much more forgiving of myself. I had been running around town in workout wear for 6 weeks, taking other cardio classes aside from the 3 each week at DC. When I finally wore normal clothes, I was totally able to see the difference - clothes that were normally tight on me were loose and comfortable! DC Fitness has not only taught me about eating properly, I learned that incorporating exercise into my daily routine was not something I dread, but actually enjoy. Thank you DC Fitness for helping me with this life change!</Review>

I’ve been training at DC Fitness for just over 2 years now. When I first spoke to Dylan on the phone, I remember asking him what he does for continuing education, his vision for the business, and some other off the wall questions. He answered them swiftly, and I knew DC Fitness was the right place for me to be at. The attention they take to progressing their knowledge on training is amazing, and the vision to make fitness so simple anyone can get results, has rang true for me. I have some shoulder range of motion limitations, an insane work schedule, and the custom workout programs I get at DC Fitness are not only easy to follow (albeit super hard) they are also fun. I Love the atmosphere and other clients in this gym. If you have injuries or are just looking to be apart of an amazing gym, DC Fitness is a must for you.</text>

I've never done any personal training (nor have I been active or athletic in my whole life) before and therefore feel very fortunate to have found DC Fitness. I had my first evaluation and training session with Dylan. The evaluation was very comprehensive and I believe essential for anyone who is looking for long-term lifestyle change and subsequent maintenance (not just to lose weight or get fit within a certain time frame and then rebound afterward). It is also important because you get to understand the strengths and weaknesses of your body and train more effectively and scientifically. I then had more sessions with Sara, who's just been an awesome lady to work with. All the trainers and staff on the team are super friendly and encouraging - They're attentive to your needs and progress. The gym itself is an intimate setting, and I've enjoyed my encounters with other clients (It's not competitive or self-serving like some other gyms in LA). Overall an uplifting culture. I always feel my sessions pass by in no time, while still being adequately challenged! Thank you Dylan and Sara. And thank you Jaslyn for always being so on top of the scheduling!</text>

Joining DC fitness was one of the greatest decisions I have ever made for myself. I have struggled for years with finding the right gym and the right workout program and DC fitness has been the answer. You couldn't ask for a better team, a better program, or a better price for a personal training experience. Dylan and his staff are some of the most helpful and compassionate people I have ever encountered in a gym setting. Not only do I get a person to positively motivate me while I workout, I also get a completely personalized workout program redesigned for ME every 4 weeks. It's pretty incredible. Dylan and his staff also help with diet, routine, scheduling etc. Booking a session couldn't be easier as well, it is right through the MINDBODY app. I give DC fitness a 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend to anyone, regardless of age, experience, or schedule.</Review>

<time>1494869407147<//time><text>I live to fish, it's more than just a hobby, it's my passion.
But for the past 5 years, my passion has been nothing more than a distant memory due to severe back pains. I had been afraid of any type strenuous lifting - from giant fish to my groceries; so lifting weights was out of the question in my mind. After beating myself up about this, I decided I needed to do something about it so I looked around and a close friend recommended that DC fitness was perfect for getting me back in shape while minding my injury. BEST DECISION EVER. I now feel 10x better than I did before and my back is stronger than ever (along with my core and legs that I've never really paid attention to). Although the workouts are tough, the atmosphere is is energetic and Dylan keeps the environment fun, friendly and stress free.
If you're someone who has an injury and it's preventing you from getting healthy, I would suggest giving DC fitness a look.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>I've worked in many gyms through out my life. Many of the large commercial gyms I felt like I wasn't making a difference for people. I have been working here at DC Fitness for about 8 months. Immediately through our programing system I knew I was in the right place. Here we make customized programs specifically to each clients needs. We create a complete physical baseline for clients through testing for body fat, muscular strength, endurance, and imbalance testing. We then use linearization programing to show them how we are going to help reach there fitness goals. Reassessments are done every month to track their progress and make adjustments to their programs if necessary. We offer complimentary fitness assessments to anyone interested in joining. Please don't hesitate to contact us. Don't wait when it comes to your health.<//Text>< gmapID>

My son Dylan had a dream to open up his own gym.  I'm his mom and am VERY proud of him.  I too have always been into fitness, always going to the gym.  I even got into road biking and did a major 395 mile ride from San Francisco to Santa Barbara. It was the best and worst experience of my life.  Best because it fulfilled my own dream, and worst because during the ride I fell and injured my knee. I've had pain and swelling in that knee ever since and my doctor said I needed a knee replacement.                                                 My son kept telling me to come to his gym because I could no longer exercise. Finally I succumbed.  It's taken a while for my knee to get strong but I'm at a point where it hasn't swollen and I don't wear my knee brace.  I've been going twice a week and am so happy I followed happy I followed my sons advice. I train with Sara and Larrell and they are phenomenal. My knee feels almost back to where it was before the injury and I am so happy I won't need surgery. I recommend D.C. Fitness to anyone who has injuries and is looking to train around them and also wants to strengthen the muscles around to alleviate the pain.< /Text>

<Review>I accepted a 6-week challenge at DC Fitness, and at first I was skeptical, because their workouts were only 60 mins, 3 times a week and a meal plan that seemed unrealistic. So how was was I going to accomplish my goals  with a plan I didn’t believe was realistic? How could they guarantee me the results I was aiming for! Fast forward 6 weeks, the intense workouts were beyond what I expected and pushed me to my limits. I chose to lose 5% body fat and at the end of the program I lost roughly 7%.  Not only did I exceed my goal, but now I am back to where I wanted physically.  Thanks to Dylan and the trainers for pushing me, providing me with a customized nutrition plan and modified workouts during my times of injury. DC Fitness is definitely a place you want to check out if you want to yield results. As long as you adhere to their plan, you will be happy!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>DC Fitness is more than a workout program, it is a family. When you walk in, you are always greeted not only by the staff but by the other members who you get to know as well. Everyone has a huge smile and is always happy to see each other and catch up.

I have only been training with Dylan and his team for a month, and I really feel a difference already. Dylan and his team really care about your overall health throughout the entire week, and give you tips on what you should be doing on days when you aren't coming in. Dylan also checks in to make sure you are sleeping and eating well.

I have gone to other gyms and felt like I just blended in with everyone else doing their own thing, but at DC Fitness you become part of a family and a team where everyone is working together and supporting one another in their health goals. I strongly recommend you contact them ASAP to check it out!<//Review><gmap_id>0x80c2bc9ffe82fc25:0x22aea43e08991e6b<//gmap_id><Response>None</Response>< rate>

Best experience I've ever had! I just finished the 6 week weight loss challenge and it was the best! I lost 20.2 pounds! They not only pushed me but they helped me succeed to reach my goal! They gave me the tools I needed, challenging workouts, a meal plan catered to my needs and held me accountable  throughout tge challenge. Dylan, Emma, Adam and the rest of the team are not only super motivating but wonderful people! If you're like me and need a lil push to reach that goal, call Dylan and make an appointment to meet with him and start this new and wonderful journey towards a healthier you! Join the DC Fitness family!</Text>

I had never had any health and fitness routine, never exercised consistently and didn’t make any real effort to eat well, so when I walked out of the gym after making the commitment to lose 6% body fat in 6 weeks, I was already making peace with my failure. 6 weeks and 2 days later, I’m really freakin’ proud of myself and so grateful for the life changing experience I had with DC Fitness. I lost 6.5% body fat and 12lbs, which is cool and all, but the real transformation for me was the joy I felt in going to the gym, and the future of strength and wellness that’s possible for me as a result of the confidence and knowledge I gained from the DC fam. The people are great, the work outs are challenging and personal, and the meal plan is... hard... but worth it! Lol. If you’re considering it, DO IT 👏<//Text>< userid>

I am a former athlete and used to work out all the time, but over the recent years had fallen off because of work and a lack of motivation. Dylan and DC Fitness completely changed that. They revitalized my workout routine and I almost immediately saw MAJOR results. In just 5 short months, I lost 10 pounds, 1.5 inches off my waist, went down almost 2.5% in body fat, and saw cuts all over my body that hadn't seen in years. The most exciting part of all of this, however, was my renewed sense of motivation and desire to exercise again. They made me realize how much I missed it!

They are friendly, knowledgable, will help you with any nagging injury you may have, and create a fun and relaxed environment to work out in, all the while keeping the intensity high and the sweat pouring off your body.

I would recommend DC Fitness to people of all fitness levels and dedication!<//Review>

They had really good reviews and a great introductory offer/program, so I trained with Dylan and Larrell for a month (semi-private, 3x/week). I lost 2% body fat and was really happy with my results. I didn't sign up for their long-term programs immediately, and instead took some time off and just started again after several months. I came back having re-gained the weight I previously lost, plus some extra. I did an assessment after 3 weeks of working out at DC Fitness again and lost almost 3% body fat. Very much looking forward to the rest of my results. Dylan, Larrell and Emma are great trainers who are always open to feedback. Every person has their own custom program and body composition is checked every month to track progress and figure out the best way to move forward. Love it here and I definitely recommend this place for folks who are having a tough time toning up on their own.<//review>< Pics>

I just finished my 6 week challenge at DC Fitness and I am so excited about the results. I dropped 19 lbs and 5.3% bodyfat in 6 weeks. All of the trainers are great, and the atmosphere is one to definitely promote great results. You become a part of a community of liked-minded, supportive people that will push you to get the results you are looking for. Thanks Dylan, Adam, Larrell, and Emma!<//review>

<review>This place was a life saver. I have been struggling with lower back pain for year now. A herniated disk kept me in constant pain and away from the gym. Dylan created a corrective based program that has help me strengthen my core and lower back. I am able to move and do activities I would stay away from for years. He is highly knowledgeable and answers any questions I may have. I would recommend him to all.</review>< Date>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>what a journey it was when I first started coming here! I learned about this place from a Snapchat ad I saw.  Basically, it was promoting a six week challenge for a gym located in Brentwood.  I was called and told that the goal is to lose either 25 lbs or 6% BF within 6 weeks.  The catch is that you must pay a fee, but it will be reimbursed if you meet either goal.  It may seem tough, but if you stick through their workouts and meal plans, then you should come out ahead.

None of this is easy, don't get me mistaken.  It will be tough at first getting used to a drastically different meal plan, as well as being worked out rigorously, more than you're probably used to.  As time goes on, it'll get easier, but you should still push yourself in workouts and don't fall into temptations in your diet.

Workouts were tough, but they were also great.  While they were hard, you generally feel good afterwards, as if you have a boost in energy, despite being sore.  I feel this also helped me on my hike to Half Dome, which happened around the Week 4 mark for me.  It made it easier.  Big shoutouts to Sequoia, TJ, Cornelius, Ezekiel, Brent, Dylan, and Ambra for all helping me in their own ways.  They are all awesome people (:

Finally, I finished with this challenge at 6.8% BF loss and I believe roughly 21 lbs lost (From 22.1% -> 15.3% and 172.1 lbs -> 151.?).  If you have a true desire to be healthy and more fit than what you are now, then I think you can do well in this challenge.  As long as you are motivated, then it does not matter if you are overweight, old, young, weak, etc.  I've seen people of all types and backgrounds put in the work and get results myself. You can do it.

Once again, big thanks to DC Fitness fam!<//Text>< Pictures>

I found this gem on Yelp, and am so happy I did. I have suffered from knee pain and was looking for something that I cold have a really tough workout without aggrevating my knees. Not only did I find that here, but they were also able to work on my muscle imbalances and the knee pain has gotten much better! This place is clean, the atmosphere is non-intimidating, and the trainers are top notch.</text>

<Text>DC Fitness is hands down the best training/fitness program I have ever been a part of. I've tried many diets, workout routines, personal trainers etc and each time I've obtained some degree of success, only to find myself falling out of the routine and returning to bad habits. DC Fitness works with you on  a journey to achieve your goals by helping you establish attainable habits in a holistic way (e.g. changes to your diet, work out programs, stretching and injury prevention etc). The trainers (Sarah, Larell & Dylan) are superb and the entire staff is incredibly helpful and a pleasure to work with.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

To put it bluntly Dylan and his staff KICKED MY BUT!!!!  But in the best way possible.  Halfway through the session, I remember thinking "I don't think I have ever had my arms feel like this so quick!"  And I played water polo in college and had weight training coaches with whom I could never get the results I wanted in my biceps and forearms.  More importantly, the staff at CF fitness takes pre-existing injuries very seriously.  They understand that before you start building your dream body, you have to fix the one you have first.  Because if you injure yourself even worse, you aren't going to get anywhere.  Young or old they understand what you need and if you stay committed you will achieve it at DC Fitness.<//Text>

I first found DC Fitness on Facebook and when I inquired about the 6 week free challenge I was immediately contacted by Dylan and made an appointment to come in to see for myself.
I was totally impressed and after speaking with Dylan for about 20 or 30 minutes I signed up for the challenge which I would start a few weeks later. I was completely supported throughout the six-week challenge with a meal plan accountability check-ins a Facebook group and a community of other clients and amazing trainers not to mention Dylan himself.
I would highly recommend DC Fitness and any program including the six-week challenge because they absolutely deliver results. I lost 20 lb in 6 weeks and it really couldn't have been easier, not that I didn't work hard not that the trainings aren't hard but if you're motivated you can make it happen. A million thanks to Dillon, Emma, Adam and Larrell.</Review>

highly recommend DC fitness! After dealing with injuries for years and not knowing if what I was doing was helping or hurting me more, I decided I needed professional help! They were great at finding my imbalances and tailoring my workouts to target my weak spots so I can work out without fear of injuring myself further.</Review>

As a mom of four and grandma of 3, it's been a very long time since I have been happy with my weight and fitness level. Since my youngest child is now away at college, I finally have time to focus on myself.  When I saw the DC Fitness 6 Week Challenge Video on Facebook, I was intrigued, but didn't think I could possibly lose 20 pounds in 6 weeks, let alone 6 months.  Nevertheless, with Dylan's encouragement, I reluctantly decided to give it a shot.  I must say, it was truly life changing, not only for me, but also for my husband who didn't even do the challenge.  I had to completely change my eating habits and was constantly sore from the training sessions and my additional daily workouts, but the results were definitely worth the struggle.  To my surprise, I was at the top of the leader board for our group for weight loss by week 4.  Not only did I make my goal of losing 20 pounds, but  I did it by week 5.  I completed the six week challenge and lost 24.6 pounds and 3% body fat and went down 2 sizes in jeans.  My results exceeded my expectations.   My husband also lost 20 pounds because he joined me in our drastic meal changes.  While the challenge is indeed difficult, it is also very attainable and once you are in the midst of it, it becomes very east to stay on track.  DC fitness provides 3 semi-private training sessions a week that are personally geared for your fitness level and goals.  They are  offered from early morning through the evening with great trainers: Larrell, Adam and Emma.  The flexibility of choosing the training time and trainer circumvents skipping training because of a difficult schedule.  DC fitness provides an initial weight and body fat assessment, personal meal and fitness plan.  They also provide resources like a shopping list, meal prep ideas, a cookbook, menu suggestions for eating out, extra workout videos, and a private facebook page for participants to share ideas, questions, encouragement and accountability pics to help keep everyone on track.  The simplicity of the menu allowed me to take 3 out of town trips during the 6 week challenge and still maintain 100% compliance.  When you put in your complete effort in, you will get results.<//review>

<text>When I came across DC Fitness I didn't know what to expect. I reached out to them about their 6 week challenge and I got a response fast. They got me onboard and made me feel welcomed from the beginning.

They offered me a meal plan, 3 training sessions a week, and a support group on Facebook with all the other people doing the challenge as well. Dylan, the one who runs the program, even posted recipes and workout videos on the group chat.

All the trainers were very helpful and pushed me to help me meet my goals. The vibes inside the studio were always great. In the 6 weeks, I lost 16lbs equaling to 7.3% body fat. Now I can wear crop tops!!

I couldn't be happier with the results. If anyone is serious about transforming their life and changing their eating habits, I really recommend DC Fitness. They will definitely help you get onboard with your transformation!< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

As a local registered dietitian sharing a mission with DC Fitness of enhancing individual health through evidence-based, effective practice, I cannot recommend Dylan Conrad and the staff & services of DC Fitness enough. Between Dylan's kinesiologist credential (among many others) and the practices that DC Fitness employs to specifically measure a participant's progress, I can confidently refer my patients to DC Fitness knowing that they will be trained in a manner that considers any existing injuries, health concerns, or personal obstacles to exercise.

When I experienced a DC Fitness training session myself, the staff was welcoming, introducing me to each person in the room to encourage a familial atmosphere that immediately made me feel comfortable and safe. I was taken through a thorough assessment that allowed them to identify any compromised areas within my movement and to help me establish specific fitness goals.  I was then guided through a customized workout by Dylan and Larrell. It was apparent that both trainers had an extensive knowledge of exercise physiology, helping me to maintain good form while challenging my fitness abilities. I left feeling confident, motivated, and clear on what my fitness goals were moving forward. And it's impossible to dread working out with Dylan and his staff because they make the whole process fun! My favorite part of their programs is that they are designed in a way that is accessible and practical for most.

I have no hesitations in recommending DC Fitness to my patients and family/friends because I know anyone I send to Dylan and his staff will receive excellent care all around, which is rare. Definitely check them out!< /Review>

<Review>I had been working out at a commercial gym for several months hoping to gain some muscle mass. It wasn’t too long before I realized that I’m not seeing results other than a shoulder injury. So, I decided to look for a local personal trainer and it wasn’t an easy task AT ALL! After a week of rigorous search, I found DC fitness and decided to give it a shot. Joining DC fitness was one of the best desicions I’ve made in a long time.

I’ve been working out with Dylan (private sessions) and his team - Larrell and Emma (semi-private sessions) for the last 2 months and I am seeing amazing results so far. I have higher energy levels, my balance and flexibility have improved significantly and I’m gaining muscle mass. I’ve come to realize that what I’ve been missing while working out on my own, was a tailored workout and nutrition plan designed by a knowledgable and caring trainer to follow and reach my goals without injuring myself.

Dylan and his team are passionate about fitness and it shows through the energy and enthusiasm they bring to every session. Dylan makes each workout session challenging, creative and most importantly he motivates you to push past your perceived limits to get results. He switches up the program regularly to keep your body from adapting to the routines. He also makes sure that your form is spot on with each exercise.
I have also referred my girlfriend to Dylan, and she has witnessed similar results and happy with her decision to join DC fitness.

If you’re in the market for a trainer, and you are serious about changing your lifestyle and reaching your goals, Dylan and his team at DC fitness will lead you every step of the way. To be honest, you’d be foolish to pass on at least giving DC fitness a try. Just don’t take my time slots!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Dylan came to my Cowering space and did a lunch & learn. He kept me and all the attendees engaged. The information he provided was all applicable to our daily lives. He touched on posture, breathing, and functional training. Being a busy professional and sitting for long hours I used the information provided and fell the pain in my neck reducing. Im excited to say Im going to be going in for a complimentary session in the near future. I would recommend this guy.< /Review>< Response>

<pics>None< /pics><Review>Dylan and Larrell are great trainers and have lots of knowledge. They emphasize technique and form before anything. They create clear cut training programs.Through linearization they graph out a roadmap month by month on how they are going to reach fitness goals of their clients.  I respect how much communication they have between themselves and their clients. Every month right before a client is done with a training phase, they sit down with them and explain why exercises they will be doing next month and the reasoning behind picking the exercise. They want the clients to gain knowledge along with their training. Beyond the training aspect, the environment is great. Everyone comes together for a common cause, which is to be healthy.<//Review><Time>1498242829401<//Time></record>

<review>DC Fitness is THE BEST! If you're looking for personal training in a group setting, where the owner and trainers all have expert knowledge, provide quality care and personal attention, DC Fitness is THE BEST! I joined their program and have been a huge fan now for six months. They've helped me tremendously.

I have a bad knee with no cartilage. My sports orthopedic doctor recommended surgery which I'm trying to avoid at all costs. My chiropractor (Dr. Ben Kleinbrodt, Brentwood Spine & Sport) referred me to Dylan at DC Fitness where he suggested I work with Dylan and his trainers on my hips in addition to my knee.

The results! After six months, I have virtually no knee pain. I've lost 20+ pounds and have dropped my body fat to a "normal" level. More importantly, I feel like I'm in great shape for my age--I have stopped taking Aleve daily and have amp'd up my workout to begin lunges again.

I purposely alternate between Dylan's two lead trainers: Emma and Larrell. Both provide consistent training, but share different insights and motivation techniques to keep me on track. One of the perks of DC Fitness is its family atmosphere. There are no prima donnas -- only committed customers!!!< /review><username>Jill Hartley<//username><Pics>None<//Pics>< date>

<Review>I’ve been training with DC fitness for quite a while. It's amazing how the team trains with minimal equipment. It shows that fancy stuff isn't necessary.  Basics with free weights, cable machine, kettle bells, barbells, and your own body weight. The trainers really customize your programs and I notice a difference in my overall movement/strength and its applicability with everyday things (like carrying heavy cases of water). I really enjoy seeing my progress and gains in strength, mobility, and flexibility. The trainers are able to push me and they somehow know I'm stronger than I think I am.  I guess I actually can deadlift 200# (at least one rep). Haha. And somehow they convinced me to do burpees. I hate burpees.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Gyms and personal trainers have never appealed to me as I have always got my training from surfing and jiu jitsu but I am now in a traveling work situation that doesn't allow me to do either one very often.  I knew it was time to meet with a trainer to get me on a workout program while I am living in hotels and on the road. My close friend recommended Dylan, saying he cant believe how strong and fit he has become since he has been working with him and how his core strength has also helped his surfing.

I decided to give Dylan a shot and I can say it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. He is so thorough and clear on what exercises work on certain body types and he immediately got me on a great workout routine that I can do at home, in the gym or more importantly take on the road with me. I can honestly say if I stop traveling for work and could start consistently surfing and training jiu jitsu again, I would definitely continue training with Dylan as I have never felt better and can see the results that I was after.</Review>

I'd highly recommend Dylan and DC Fitness!  I've worked with Dylan twice since 2011, each time for a few months, and in both cases I achieved significant results.  When Dylan and I first connected in 2011 I had just started back to the gym after taking well over a year off, and having had recurring back issues for a few years was subsequently pretty sedentary and not in great shape at the time.  I had never worked with a personal trainer before, and I learned a lot from the program and exercises.  And, had gained back a lot of strength I had lost previously. I'd like to think Dylan played an instrumental part in getting me back on track and really motivated about my fitness again!

From 2012-2015 I ventured off on my own again and had reached a new plateau of fitness - gaining a lot of strength in the process (being even much stronger than I was in my 20s; almost 20 years earlier!).  But, I definitely had some imbalances (upper body strength and bench was great, but was lacking a bit in lower body - deadlift and squats specifically).  This program helped considerably and I was actually able to reach a deadlift personal record that I had been trying to break though own my own without success.  And, this strength program played a huge part in doing a grueling 12 mile Tough Mudder obstacle course race at the end of my training.

Dylan and team are:

* Very professional, helpful and patient when it comes to providing feedback, correcting form and guidance

* Super knowledge on program creation - knowing which exercises, sets, reps, and different phases to work through for achieving results

* Helpful on providing guidance on nutrition and diet

* Knowledgable on working around injuries and coming up with a gameplan to correct. I had never done much mobility work before, or worked specifically on addressing weakness and found this work to be instrumental< /Text>

<Review>Greeted by very friendly office personnel.  Accommodations were clean.  Stay was quiet except for someone showering at 4am which resulted in loud water pipe noise.  Bed was a bit too firm.  Water was cool when I was taking a shower.  Shower temp fluctuated when husband taking a shower.< /Review>< pictures>

Everything is weird with COVID. Check in was quick even though it was hard to understand the clerk through the glass.  The rooms are not very soundproof, but our neighbors were turned off early enough and the freeway doesn't bother us. It was a nice stay and very convenient to Old Town.</review>

This is a great little hotel right next to Old Town Temecula that is within walking distance to all the fun places to eat and drink.  The hotel itself is small and nothing special to look at from the outside.  The inside is a different story, the rooms are very clean, have nice amenities (microwave,fridge,coffee,blow dryer). The beds are comfortable and it’s quite.  I choose this hotel over all the others at this price point in the area because it’s comfortable and family owned.  The owner is very nice as well.  👍<//review>

Room was okay. The curtains however smelled like marijuana not sure why. But also a little annoying that management comes knocking at your door in 5-10 minute intervals 30 min before check out.</Review>

I didn't rent there or anything like that but what I did notice that the vending machines hadn't been filled and there was only one beverage available. And also the pool area was desperately needing maintenance. But for 55 dollars a night what do you expect.<//review>

The place was clean, the rooms were neat and tidy. Small motel so it was super quiet even being so close to the freeway. The staff was great in giving me info about getting around town as well as giving me the rundown about the property. I felt welcomed.<//text>

request and was told I would have ground floor, well lit parking area in front of room...I called on way to say I was in slow traffic and wouldnt be there by 3pm...they said no problem.  When I checked in, they said ground floor room was in back of bldg where I didnt want to be...they told me others came b4 me and got my room but upstairs was available facing front lite parking so I accepted although there were 3 short flights of stairs to carry my heavy luggage. 2) no batteries in tv remote when i returned at 2am & could not watch tv!  they didnt want to bring me batteries cuz he was asleep & wanted me to go downstairs but i told him I was already dressed for bed so I had nothing until I called again at 9am...isnt that their job? to provide service when needed? or at least see that all in working order b4 haveing a guest occupy...that was bad.< /Text>

Got a 2 queen bed and it was okay. I did not like zzz'show much and pricey they charged for 5 people. It is best to book online for cheaper if you can. I usually book all my hotels online for cheaper but it was such a tiring night that I thought if I go in, they will be friendly and accommodate some discounts but guess not. Not sure if I'll stay here again.<//review>

Rooms were clean. Place was quiet. The staff was very nice and welcoming. The location is very convenient to old Town Temecula. We just walked over there for dinner, drinks, and found a bar with live music. For the price I think we got more than we bargained for.</text>

The desk staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and well furnished. When we experienced a plumbing issue that caused our shower the lose hot water and prevented it from turning off - all while trying to get ready for a wedding - the manager on duty was able to open the next room over to give us the space to prepare while he and some staff repaired the shower. We didn't even have to move rooms completely because they finished before we left for the evening. This was a completely unforeseeable issue and we were impressed with the professionalism, courtesy, and expedited repair we experienced. We will definitely consider staying here again if we are in the area in the future.<//Text>

<review>The owner is the most rude person I have ever met. He told us there was no alcohol allowed in the room. The whole place smelled like feces! There were bugs in the room as well. Do not go here unless you want a terrible experience. Ended up leaving early because it was so bad. Went to Motel 6 and it’s waaay better. Honestly sleeping in a tent around the corner with the tweakers would be a better experience.</review></record></dataset><record>

Hey, it’s not a luxury hotel, but if you want a clean room at an economy price that’s walking distance to all the restaurants, bars and shops on Old Town Front Street, this is not a bad choice. The pool area isn’t the best and they have strict checkout time, but the cost and location makes up for it.< /text>

<review>In a pinch this place will do fine. The room was clean,  the air conditioning worked perfect. The bed was comfortable. I only have two complaints. The satellite signal kept dropping from time to time and the pool area could have used some help on how it was presented. I give this place 3.5 stars.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Located right beside the entrance to Old Town Temecula. Rooms are clean and well maintained. The pillow-top beds are comfortable. The best part is the wifi which actually connects and is reasonably fast. The manager is friendly and informative. Weekend rates are a little higher than usual. No complimentary breakfast.<//text>

Room was large and clean. Furnished with everything you need for a short stay, including a comfortable chair, frig and microwave. Breakfast was awful. No meat. Eggs were not edible. Only 2 yogurts left. Room was a good value but skip the breakfast.</review>

We stayed at the hotel for a holiday weekend. The price for a room was pretty high for what you get but I suppose that's to be expected. Simple, small room but they were nice enough to let us check in a few hours early when we requested it.</Text>

Upon first glance the room looked decent for the price we paid but when it came to actually settling down for bed we noticed a bedbug crawling on the sheets next to one of our pillows. We immediately brought this to the owners attention and instead of listening and trying to come up with a solution, she instantly became defensive and argued it was not a bedbug. Her husband was even worse and yelled the whole time. Very unprofessional. I will not be returning.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Drove here specifically for the fact that just prior to driving here, I spoke with a woman on the phone who told me that if I pay with my debit card then they would not have to run the card for the $200 deposit they're asking for (I did not have $200 for a deposit....maybe half that and couldn't have the card run) and that just having the info from the card would be sufficient to rent the room. So I get there and now a young man is working at the desk and when he asked for the deposit I explained I spoke with a woman and what she had said and he told me that no they could not do that and against their policy. I wasn't able to get a room, wasted the gas driving there and now still in same situation but with even less gas now. I ended up sleeping in the car that night. I was looking forward to staying there bc it beats Motel 6 that's right across the way but I will definitely not be staying there or attempting to again. Disappointing to say the least.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80db7fc86a9e41b3:0xb621345c6c7ac7d< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great value. Good for business and travel. The new owners are very attentive and without a doubt paying attention to details. Furniture was good quality. Very clean. It was quite and i felt safe. Didnt see any questionable behaviour at night, as some older reviews have stated. It is almost like new construction. Good selection of restaurants and stores in the area. It was very nice to see people who cares about their work, have respect for their clientele, and were very hospital. Recommend! Its new owners with a new ship. Dont let old reviews sway you, gerat deal and comfort.<//text>

<text>Owner's exceptionally friendly not forward or condescending!!! Neighborhood is trying too improve. My stand point is nothing changes overnight, don't kill yourselves proving nothing, our weather play's an important part in our Attitude, Demeanor, Overall Well Being. Keep your Faith in what you do strong, he will provide.</text>< Rating>

The worst hotel I have ever been to and the weekend rate is outrageous! The people that run it are disgusting and can't speak English. The room had 1980 carpet in it that probably hadn't been cleaned since then. We didn't get in until late Saturday night and it was not a welcome refuge. If we could have found another we would have. Creepy, old, and dirty.< /Text>

I was in town for a wedding, stayed here for 1 night. The staff was friendly and helpful. Second story floors are a little creaky and walls are a bit thin (listened to a woman cry about her cheating husband the next morning), but the beds are comfortable and the rooms are tidy and clean. If fancy hotel amenities aren't a deal breaker, then this is a good place to stay.<//Review>

<text>If I could give them 0 stars I would.

Our hotel would not work! And the office was closed, and we could not even sleep there. Had to uber to a friends house because all of our stuff was locked in the hotel. Terrible service, power went out twice on us while staying for a brief few hours.< /text>< pics>

< Review>
So this review is a tough one because the rooms here are really nice. They aren't huge but they come with an iron,blow dryer,fridge,microwave and even a coffee maker. The beds are super comfy and the rooms are decorated very nicely. Consisting of the bed, a nice writing desk and a chair with an ottoman. The sound walls are insulated well keeping heat or cold in and sound out. During the week you can pretty much show up at any hour and get room on the weekends due to its vicinity to the old town bars it gets pretty full. All the rooms at the location are non smoking and they do not allow pets of any kind. My main issue with this place is the random rates they quote you and the weird amounts of tax they charge. (Weekday rate is anywhere from 55 to 99 dollars. Weekend rates are from 110 to 200 a night) The prices are made up on the spot and change day to day even if you are the only guest. Be prepared to threaten to go to the Motel 6 across the street to get the best price for the night. Check out is 11AM if you want a late check out be prepared to fork out 20 dollars an hour. I've been staying at this little inn for several years and if you can get over the haggling and random charges it's a nice room within miles of the wineries, bars and casino. I say check it out if you're in town.</Review>

Worst customer service ever.... I was asking questions in regards to the booking and the lady that answered was very rude and would not even let me finish asking and just talked over me... Definitely did not book and just canceled.... never again< /text>

<Review>Very clean. Friendly staff. Centrally located. I could walk a short distance to Dennys, Pedfolds Cafe and Bakery, mexican rest, etc. The only concern was there was fishy business going on in one of the rooms that made me very uncomfortable. Not sure if it was just my luck or a regular occurence.<//Review>< user_id>

I booked the room last night and canceled it today. The lady who answered the phone was extremely rude & inconsiderate regarding my cancelation. I ended up giving this establishment  $28 for nothing.   I'm not picky but when I read the last review about bedbugs, I had to immediately cancel.   The lady never stated that bedbugs wasn't an issue. I'd rather not take a chance.< /text>

<Text>Doesn't look great from the outside, but the rooms are nice and clean.  The staff was nice, typical mom and pop type place.The price is great for being so close to downtown. The only issue is the pool, it looked nasty when walking by it to the room but we never had any intentions of swimming so not an issue for us.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< rating>

Humongouss portions!!!! That is the best way to describe the value. Roomy indoors and well kept. Plenty of choices and you can see the food being cooked fresh. Plenty of parking. High chairs. Family friendly and excellent service. My server was helpful and was generous with the serving. There was no doubt they wanted to make sure I got my moneys worth. Only gave it 3 stars because my food was a little cold but I would still return to try more dishes.</Text>

<review>Just left from this location . I really wish I would of went somewhere else . It’s not that the food wasn’t ok but the services was horrible. The Asian lady who helped me basically throw my food in a container, snatched my money from out my hand , then had the nerves to push my food towards me with the back wide open . I will definitely not be going back to this place.<//review></record>

Orange chicken tasted good although it had been sitting out a while
Coccunt shrimp was very good

<text>Love this restaurant their food is great and always get alot of food for a  very good price. Their COCONUT SHRIMP is BOMB charge a little extra for it but it's well worth the charge. I choose this restaurant  over any other chinese restaurant around. They BLOW Panda Express out of the water for sure .</text>< Pictures>

One of my favorite small time places with big time flavor. They pack such a healthy portion on your plate for a reasonable price. Recommended if you want some good food without paying for it twice. Once when you buy it then again when you get home.<//Review>

Bring your appetite, theornpoertions are HUGE!!! I could feed my whole family off of one plate. As you can see by this 2 item combo I got (yes I ate the whole thing) it was awesome! I've only had a couple of items there, the orange chicken, BBQ chicken, chow mein, and the fried rice. Everything was fresh though and enough to feed a few people. You won't be disappointed!< /Review>

It's good Chinese food and they really know how to pack the boxes and bowls. I feel like the prices are good and the selection is varied enough to find something good for everyone in your party. There's lots of seating inside the restaurant in case you want to have a seat as well. Highly recommend.</Review>

I love this place generous portions. And food tastes great and for under $10 drink included in that price. If your hungry go there. If your on Keto diet go there. If you opt out of rice they hook you up with meat & veggies.<//Text>

This is definitely one of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever been to.  Nevermind the tons of food you get for the price.  Picky people talk about having to wait for them to make you a fresh plate, don't you see that they stack those plates with enough food to feed a family.  That's why you wait.  Patience is a virtue..</Text>

This establishment is clean. The food is price is reasonable and the portions are generous.

We had good service. The workers were professional. That is all I am concerned with when doing business.

The workers should GO TRAIN Happiness Nails, which is on the same strip.

Please enjoy the food at Panda Wok.

Please avoid Happiness Nails. It will cause you to lose your appetite.<//Text>

This place is actually pretty legit - the food is good and fresh and the girl there crams it into them containers like nobody's business. The prices are average I guess.... And by all appearances the place looks clean. Would fo sho recommend :)< /Text>

Standard, fast Chinese food. But, the chicken vegetable soup is very good. And their bean balls are very good treat.<//Text>

I ordered  2 of the combo  and the young lady didn't make the dinners correctly. When I got to sit down both dinner trays were the # b combo. I got one entree and maybe a few pieces of the second entree. I should of been able to eat two sides and there was only one entree since she put like 5 pieces of broccoli and 3 pieces of beef. The food was good but I'd of really liked to of enjoyed the teriyaki and beef broccoli I'd ordered instead of just teriyaki chkn.<//review>

Food is sub-par... and they are very unaccomodating. I ordered a 3 item combo with chow mein and an order of shrimp fried rice. I was going to give the chow mein to my daughter who is vegetarian. So I asked if they  could put the meat items in seperate container. She said sure and proceeded to fill the smallest container they had with chow mein. So I asked why are you giving me less and Im paying the same price. The girl assisting was nice and apologized saying the owner makes her do it that way.  I explained my reasons for wanting that way and she asked the owner/manger and she said no. Or she would charge me per container. If it had not been so late and my last stop before going home I would have walked out. But I will never go back. The food was less than okay and the service was horrible. I cannot wait for China Bistro to finish their remodel and open back up.< /text>

Food is not exciting. Orange chicken sauce was good but chicken was over cooked and tough. Won ton soup had no flavor tasted like hot water poured  veggies. Noodles are more like spaghetti with coloring added.  Won't go back.< /Review>

This is the worst Chinese restaurant I’ve been to.. the trays they use to give you your food are small. They put mostly noodles or rice in it and your sides are very small the price they charge for mostly noodles is ridiculous!! Also did I mention most cases you have to wait for them to cook more food. I will never go back there again.<//Review>

Tastless shrimp wonton soup, more like plain hot water where they dropped all the ingredients. Big, cold, half empty space, everything disposable, not even a lemon wedge to spare. Second time eating there,  second bad dish, never again.  👀<//Text>

My daughter loves the chow mein. I love the jalapeño chicken and spicy fish. Wonderful substitute for Cathay's when I don't feel like fighting Newport Road. When it first opened, it was a little weak but man! They stepped it up.< /text>

Giving three stars because they took 20 mins extra to get eggrolls and steamed veg, compared to other places that have that on demand. Chowmien had a big taste difference. (In a good way)< /Text>

I love the authenticity and the way they have a natural home cook taste to their meals. I had a beef broccoli bowl and my mans got a 2 entree combo with teriyaki chicken and barbeque chichen with chow mein. So good! So filling !!:))</text>

Basically like Panda Express with less options. Decent food for the money but the employees lacked experience and seemed to be rushing for no reason.</Text>

Disappointed! Panda Express is Much better!

We have been waiting for this place to open for months. Such a disappointment. The food lack taste and freshness. Go off Newport and stop at Panda Express for chinese food.<//Review>

<rating>4<//rating><Text>Good team, but hard to find. Entrance on 15th. No markers or signs. TIP: this is NOT a building. UBER has two containers that they use for their personal to stay dry and warm (heaters).it is right underneath the bridge. North side of 15th. There usually are signs on the fences, advertising to the station inside.< /Text>< date>

<Review>Extremely bad customer services ever.. 5 days ago I called uber in sf to pick me up. It's very sad this uber guy doesn't speak English so he was lost for bout 15 minutes. By the time he picked me up it was around 1:30 am in the morning. He also need to pick up someone from out a block from me. He dropped this person off crossing the Golden Gate Bridge and we were lost there for another 20 minutes and I was trying my best with my broken Chinese to him.

It took him bout 30-60 minutes to get me home. The next day uber charged me from $9 to $46 dollars due to this guy's poor English and lack of direction. As soon as it shows in my account I reported right away and uber only refund me $25. I'm still fighting for the remainder of $12 dollars.

This is not only once I have had so many problems with uber and I am not going to take uber ever again.<//Review>< pics>

Uber's driver support are from another country which they don't know 99.9% what they're talking about. When a driver have questions/query and they give you an answer that has nothing to do with your query/question. Quit using your SOP and maybe you guys should read the driver's query/ questions your selves instead of making the machines do all your work. Get it right people!< /review>

(Translated by Google) Little professional, bad customer service, the person who attended to me gave me very bad attention and made me feel like it is not a company of respect for being so few professionals with the People I have not finished the process because I forget my insurance but I'm thinking area return to this place🤔

(Original)
Poco profecionales ,mal servicio al cliente,la persona que me atendio me dio muy mala atencion y me Hizo sentir como que no es una compañia de respeto al ser tan pocos profecionales con la Gente no he terminado el proceso por que olvidar mi seguro pero lo estoy pensando area regrezar a este lugar🤔<//review>

Fresh lumpia, sweet and sour crispy fish, and crispy pata! We ordered more than two people could or even should eat in one sitting, we took it home n the leftovers made for wonderful tacos! We need to go back for more and I need to try the desserts!< /Text>< pictures>

Great value on the fresh Lumpia. I was originally shocked to see it priced at $12 but surprised to actually see what we were paying for. Two large Lumpia on a plate. It was decent but nothing like I've had before. Sauce was bland and perhaps smaller Lumpia would have worked better. Overall it was decent but good be better<//review>

<text>Came for lunch at 1:00 on a weekday and there were a good number of people dining. There was only one waiter, so service was a bit slow. Ordered from the lunch special menu where items were about $9 and you get lumpia, rice, pancit, plus whatever entree. I chose the porkchop. Overall, the food was average, but kinda pricey for what you get.< /text><name>Glori Avendaño</name><date>1563920718515<//date><userid>109077635724317452431</userid>< Pictures>

NOT bad at all at this local Filipino and supposedly 'fusion' American-Filipino restaurant.  Depending on which platter you get, it ranges about $40 to $50 for 4 to 6 people.   We got the grilled meat platter and all of them were good and made fresh. I also tried their lumpia and it is my least favorite (sorry). The boneless bangus balls (Kind of like meatballs But made of fish) was really good too and the rest of the grilled meat.  You might wanna come before the rush hour or weekdays because there's not much parking.

3 things:
1. I will come back again
2. Grilled liempo is a must
3. Dine-in or To-go  It's to-go!< /text>

One of the most authentic Filipino spots around. It's kind of a hidden spot if you're not paying attention. There's a lot of parking as for it's in a plaza. The dishes are family style and the price can be a bit steep.< /Text>

Food is good, service sucks. Actually food is really good or else I would not come back here at all. I had to flag down the servers for everything. Several times they just walked past me. It was not busy at all. They look like they do everything in their power not to make eye contact. If service was even a little better they would have received 5 stars.<//text>

Ambiance is good. Customer service is super accommodating. And great food to top it off.
Ate here for breakfast. Got my typical Tapsi, Longsi, and the their famous chicken adobo. Can be a bit pricy but its all good.< /Text>

Pinoy Food run

Green Banana Leaf is a new Filipino/Asian Fusion eatery. However, unlike most Filipino food spots in the area, GBL is a sit down restaurant, with a chic décor, 90's hip hop/R&B playing on the house speakers and Instagram worthy dishes. Not a turo-turo (hot tray, point at what you want) place. Being hipster-ish, prices are higher than the typical Filipino haunts. For our inaugural visit, we were in a hurry and shared two plates.

Molo soup
Wow, look at all those wontons! I counted over a dozen wontons by the time we got to the bottom of this huge bowl of soup. Perfect on a cold evening! I could taste the ginger, garlic & onions with every steaming spoonful. I wanted soup (of some sort) and this didn't disappoint.

Quarter chicken combo w/ egg rolls
GBL has various fried chicken combos. We chose the quarter chicken combo, which comes with lumpianitas (egg rolls) and choice of steamed rice or garlic fried rice. The lumpianitas were perfectly fried, crunchy & delicious. I usually don't order chicken from restaurants, as I prefer Church's and avoid chicken everywhere else, but the quarter chicken had a deliciously fried crispy skin. However, the portions were rather meager, so I probably wouldn't order their chicken combo again.

Green Banana Leaf has lunch specials during the week, and their extensive menu has a little something for everyone. I was told by the attendant that their most popular dish is their crispy kare kare, which is a combo of their crispy pata (fried pork hock) & kare kare (peanut butter stew). Being a little less than $20, it would have to wait for us, as we weren't looking to stay too long.

Service was good. The staff were friendly & hospitable, quick with refills. Ample seating via tables in the middle and booths around the perimeter. There is also bar seating, as well.

Parking is at the Fresh Catch Supermarket center. Green Banana Leaf is the last business on the left, next to Café 86.

Green Banana Leaf is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. The food is definitely on point, and I'm eager to try one of their signature dishes, like the crispy kare kare. Although their prices are higher than I'd want to spend on my ancestral cuisine, having lunch specials is enough to lure me back again & again. "What's for dinner?" is never a concern when there's Green Banana Leaf nearby.

Highly recommend!

This place was awesome. Really changed my view of the cookies brand. Matt the bud tender was awesome, very helpful and made things a world better. There was a much better selection here, the prices were better. If you’re looking for a treat for yourself be sure to check it out. You’ll probably find what you’re looking for here.<//review>

<review>The customer service has no quality. The worker became agitated because I was not fast enough in picking what I wanted. He grew so impatient that he had assistance to come and help him. I asked why does he need help at all and worker became agitated as evidence by posturing up, clenched fist grimacing of the face n made a point of taking off his mask n continued with loud pressured tone.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

The customer service has no quality. The worker became agitated because I was not fast enough in picking what I wanted. He grew so impatient that he had assistance to come and help him. I asked why does he need help at all and worker became agitated as evidence by posturing up, clenched fist grimacing of the face n made a point of taking off his mask n continued with loud pressured tone.< /Text>

It was a bit unorganized at first but well worth the wait, the buds we're good and the service as well. Dom was a great bud tender and helped my wife and i. Its only been a few days since it has been opened and I'm sure things will get fine tuned. Much love to Berner for bringing cookies near my city< /Text>

Tried giving me the wrong strain, I asked 4 2 churros. Would not recommend. Plus the products are overpriced. 👎🏽 & staff is beyond rude and petty. & the white boy in there w the studs looks like he wears Durags to bed 😂.< /review>

Overall great experience,  budtender guy was very knowledgable. I liked the variety of products available but a lot were sold out. The only down side is the line to wait to go inside and the line to pay was also long. I would try them again if in town.</review>

Overcharged CA Cannibis excise tax on my purchases.  A $33.00 total purchase price was $45.79 after taxed were computed.  Current excise tax rate is 15% on all cannibis products sold in CA.  The amount charged s/b $4.95 on $33.00 not $7.21.  CA state law requires that any excess excise tax collected must be refunded to the retail customer who paid the tax.  I will be continuing to make purchases here as I asume there is a simple explanation or a calculation error was made.  Overall this place has great service and great product.  The budtenders and other staff will make your visit a pleasant one.< /Review>

Cookies has finally arrived in Berdoo! Been 3 months since it's GO but i finally made it to a Cookies shop :) Nice inside but limited on space due to an accident on the property. Check in person was nice and Security was on point and nice peeps as well , My sales associate was Robby he's cool peeps also. I picked up a Stiiizy Pod and some Pacific Stone PR OG! 🔥 Fuego! Berner only deals with Quality so do yourself a favor and navigate yourself to COOKIES IE you'll be happy you did! I know I am!👊😎<//Text>

<Review>This review is no way regarding the person who checked us out at the end. Our buddtender Lino G on the other hand deserves no stars. He was rude, had no carisma and my husband and I were apparently a joke to him. I get it! It was our first time there and our first time at a dispensary in general.  He made me feel so uncomfortable and disrespected. It was as if he was mocking me for my selections and for being a “rookie”. So I originally had said I didn’t want any gummies , but  being that , that was most of what they had to offer in edibles , that’s what I ended up with. Apparently that made me a joke to him. I will not be returning because of his lack of customer appreciation and disrespect. Out on the streets that would have never went down. But these Youngsters forget what we been through and where we been at.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Review>customer service was good sort of but the guy told me that I was buying indica and it came out to be sativa and then the flower that he showed me in the jar was nothing like what I got in my jar that I bought it wasn't even trimmed it was completely covered in Waterleaf I took it home and trimmed it and got over a half a gram of Waterleaf they literally sold me a half a gram of water and charged me for it for me to go home and trim it myself 4 burner to have such a big reputation in the weed business and then for his employees to false advertise and sell me some leaf I'm just disappointed and on top of that online it said that they had $20 eighths tax free and hit me with over 15 bucks in tax for 2 eighths< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dcad7391512fd1:0x6fb8c2c17d9c5d89<//gmap_id>< pictures>

Waited in Line for 15min was rushed the whole time to place my order so I did rush and when it came time to pay she took my ID and took another 5min of my time to let me know she cannot help me never going back complete waste of my time , she said the system turns off at 10pm the time was 9:58pm she didn’t want to do her job rather be lazy and not help me while that’s fine I’ll take my business elsewhere</Text>

Went on a work lunch with 2 other amazing ladies to Sushi Yama today - first time ever going here even though its literally walking distance from my office. However I will TOTALLY be back.

We had amazing service from Amber. She was super attentive and nice, quick, efficient and catered to any request we had.

The food was AMAZING! I eat pretty healthy and so I am always aware that I could easily eat 15 sushi rolls and be stoked about it but I need to be strategic.

Their menu is online and was available for me to check out prior to arriving. I knew exactly what I wanted and it came out even better than I anticipated.

I am not sure why I haven't been there before but it will definitely be a return.

It was so delicious I literally just asked my husband if he wanted to go tonight on a date night!

5 out of 5 would definitely recommend!

- Masks to and from tables
- Casual environment
- Will be an epic summer eatery as they keep it really cold in their due to food that they serve (I recommend a jacket if you run cold)
- No outside smokers air comes in
- Split tab friendly
- Great service
- Very reasonably priced
- Indoor and patio seating
- Attached parking lot (its across the street from City Hall's larger lot)< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Gmap_id>

<text>We are relatively new to eating sushi and used a Groupon to try it out. Our waitress, Tala, was sweet, patient and helpful. The sushi was excellent as was the service. Not only will we be going back, we will bring others and be recommending Sushi Yama!</text></record></dataset><record>

Solid and tasty sushi joint, have been here many times. Great offering, great staff, great service. Carlsbad roll is definitely my favorite. Amongst many sushi places in North county these guys are definitely above average. Will continue to order from them. Take out or dine in, I'm never disappointed.< /review>

So happy they are back open for indoor dining. The stuffed jalapenos, Chronic and protein rolls are must try! All the food is great but those are my fav. They also have delivery through doordash and you can even get adult beverages delivered. All in all a staple in North County for sushi!!< /Text>

They automatically add the gratuity, to your check of 20% which I think is wrong! Especially when the service is poor! Did not have a good first experience< /Review>

The food is good, but if you want to be treated or ignored as a customer there then this is the place for you! We waited patiently for our food and watched as our server checked on every patron but us and when I inquire about the status of our food the waitress gives an attitude... Never again will I go there again!!<//text>

Once upon a time this place was one that I could not wait to go back to. After my experience today 1/30/21, I am not sure how their doors can stay open with what they are serving out of there! Food was horrible tasted like I was having a tv dinner, it was bad!  They even charged .50 cents for sriracha sauce on a to go order? I'm sorry Sushi Yama, but you have lost your authenticity. I would rather go to Costco and buy their frozen Japanese food because at least I know they are consistent.<//Review>

Zero stars. 3 orders were out in one bag.  Everything spilled. The fog just spilled all over.  Why cannot they put in in two bags.  Food terrible. Will not go again stupidity.< /Review>

<review>I went to Sushi Yama on January 18, 2021. I ordered 2 Chapulín rolls for my family and I. Up until Saturday we were sick with food poisoning. At first we thought it was COVID, because of the similar symptoms but once we received our negative test results we knew it was the food. I would like that a refund be issued at the very least but when I call the store manager is never available. I even emailed them Jan 26th and nobody has gotten back to me. I attempted to leave my information but they would not take down my information as I was told I would need to speak to the manager directly. I was told he comes in during the afternoons and when I called Friday he was not there yet. Hopefully now that I am writing this they will get back to me.<//review><Rate>1</Rate></record></dataset><record>

This place has terrible customer service. Stay away. I ordered through door dash and they canceled my order 3 hours later saying they were too busy to fulfill the order. Left their phone off the hook as well so no phone orders.< /text>

I came here 01/09/21 ( my birthday) and noticed that there were no signs to indicate social distancing so people like myself and Grubhub and Postmates were all pretty close together waiting on orders. I put my order in at 4:57PM, received it at 6:00PM. I was told it would take no more than 45 minutes to complete. They had no Mackerel, Ikura, as well as a couple others I can’t quite recall. The bill was over $100. People that were picking up food with there cars, well one of them bumped me with their car, didn’t think to ask me if I was alright. This place is awful. On top of it all someone thought I was yelling at them. I wasn’t.</review>

<rating>5</rating><review>I ordered through Uber Eats. After 35 minutes of the order saying "making your order" i called Sushi Yama to make sure they got it. It had been sitting ready for over 20 minutes. Uber Eats couldnt find a driver to pick it up. I told her that i was concerned about the quality of one item and that i didnt want it to be mushy. It was remade for me so it would be fresh! That is Grade A customer service.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

So disappointed with this place I ordered in online at 5:17pm  and I wait for my order it wasn’t ready until 7:10pm waiting for just calamari plus then I get it and it was over cook 😡😡😡😡 I believe the if they are busy they shouldn’t take anymore orders on the phone  so people don’t have to wait so long
Plus a customer order  after me she knew one of the serve and give her her food fast
This is not right I wont order again< /text>

The real question to wrestled with here is, how much arrogance, chaos and disrespect will you take to get good sushi? Because make no mistake, you are getting all three at sushi yama.

They actively sell a Groupon but it only applies to dine in and they don’t honor it for take out, which is all they offer.

Rest assured, they do a high volume of business and that only reinforces all the bad things about sushi yama. Nothing will change anytime soon.< /review>

The bento box I ordered tasted great, and the sushi rolls my wife ordered were just as good. Good pricing on food, high quality tasting ingredients.

Great sushi in my own backyard. For the longest time I've been driving down to SD for good sushi not knowing that Sushi Yama had tasty food. Me and my wife will on a Friday night and was greeted with friendly staff. I was amazed at how quickly our sushi was served also how great it tasted.
The only downside to this location is the parking. There's limited parking and the spot were tight. Other than that the establishment is nice and clean and looks to bring in all types of people.<//review>

The roll I ordered was so loosely wrapped I had to use a spoon to eat my roll. It was good... the mixed tempura was good although the sweet potatoes were crisp and not cooked through. Our waitress was awesome! I have been here before so I'm hoping they just had an off night😬< /review>

Amazing service! They are always willing to accommodate if you have an allergy or aversion to certain ingredients. The staff is always friendly and the fish is always fresh. The sushi chefs know exactly what they are doing, making the food even better! The atmosphere is calm and relaxing, perfect for dates or business. And did I mention the mochi ice cream and creme brulee?! One of my favorite gems in escondido. 10/10 O always recommend!</text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>So I figured posting a review would be less of ordeal and scene than going in and talking to the manager but my goodness was this awful sushi after spending $62 on 4 rolls.
For starters I was shorted a roll on a to-go order. So there goes a expensive meal. The sushi rolls had dry sticky rice and who knows how old the fish was being bland and dry.

Awful, just absolutely awful.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dbf49916bcf835:0x782bfebf9e42aad6</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

So far my favorite Sushi place in Escondido. The Escondido crunchy roll is my favorite. I've eat in there and service was great. I've called ahead and ordered for take out too. I need to try some other menu items but just writing about this makes me want a Escondido crunchy roll!< /Text>

It was a wonderful environment for dinner. The food was filling and tasty but the sushi rolls were not too tight. Rice was falling off the rolls. We are rewriting the history of this place with our dinner date. It was wonderful and I cant wait to eat here again!< /review>

The variety of sushi rolls they have is great....so many delicious ones to choose from and the names are fun. I wasn't as pleased with the "grilled" sea bass appetizer because it really wasn't grilled. It was also over seasoned, but other than that I enjoyed everything else.</text>

Food was great, like the atmosphere. But service was pretty weak. Our mouths were on fire from the spicy rolls we got with habanero, and the server was nowhere to be seen as our drinks ran out< /review>

From food to service, this place is the best. We live in Oceanside and we were on our way home from an event when we decided to try Sushi Yama in Escondido on our way home.  I am so glad we did. We will definitely will be making trips back on a regular basis because it's worth it! Chef Margarito, Rocky and Daisy made us feel like superstar's and they have the best sushi rolls that I have ever had.<//review>

Friendly staff, great rolls, even better price. Many of my favorite rolls are half off all the time. Why not just reduce the original menu price? Hmmmmm. Still a great value and a great price.<//Review>

<review>14 $ Rainbow Roll was worth it. The middle fresh and the fish was fresh. I ordered on the phone to go. Was ready for pick in less then 15 min. Everbody was so sweet to me.

Good food. Consistently the temperature in there is too cold. Can literally feel the air blowing. Started out so nice on our last visit but as soon as the crowd started in, the air conditioning went on and so did our jackets.< /text>

Tried ordering online through door dash confirmed my order just to cancel it shortly after. Can't even call into the location to find out why it was cancelled. Last time I use this location since they can't even let you know what's going on.< /text>

A large number of the speciality rolls are 50% off if you dine in which makes them about $6 to $7 per roll, what a great deal.  We'll definitely be back.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

This review is strictly based on the delivery experience. Placed order on Doordash for delivery with estimated delivery time of 45-50 minutes. Driver arrived and waited for the order (as was indicated on Doordash progress) and after 25 minutes eatimated delivery time changed to 87 minutes! I called restaurant and asked about that and was told restaurant was too busy! But then why mislead those ordering delivery with the wrong time?! Extremely, unhappy with the experience and hostess casually admitting that wait time changed!</text>

I first ordered two rolls which the server rang one of them up wrong. No biggie I just waited while they fixed it. I took a couple bites and got a fish bone stuck in my gum so I told the server I would pass on the roll and if I could please get my check. As she went to the back, I stacked the plates because that is something I always do to help the servers clean up the table and prebus. They took the plates to the back and I could hear them asking each other if they seen anything. Sure enough one of the girls brought out the stack of plates and it's dropping on the floor and asked me to look for the bone.😂 I was in disbelief like are you really questioning my statement? Anyway I asked for the manager and he was just as rude. They didn't care to understand my point about customer service. Very upsetting feeling like you are being accused of lying.</text><rating>1<//rating><Name>Autumn Sanford</Name><Gmap_id>0x80dbf49916bcf835:0x782bfebf9e42aad6</Gmap_id>< Pictures>

The tempura ice cream was a fun dessert to split with my date. The wait staff was attentive, and service was fast. Great food for a fair price! We will return again.< /text>< pics>

<text>Not that great and not a good value. I paid $4.50 for garlic edemame that was NOT GOOD. I had to fix it myself at home. The roll I ordered was barely cut properly because pieces were stuck together. The waitress gave me water with something floating in it. When I asked for a new water she looked at me like I was asking too much. Then I watched as a few employees discussed the water issue. After they took 7 minutes to bring me a new water, I didn’t trust to drink it. Getting food from here made appreciate Umai Sushi soo much more. Btw the manager was standing in front on his cell phone. I wouldn’t go back.<//text><userid>106141240611084523521< /userid></record></dataset><record>

Very nice sushi restaurant in Escondido. Appreciated the service the most but the food was good and they offered 50% off rolls. We started with the Pan Fried Gyozs which is basically dumplings with sesame ponzu which came out fast and was so good!!

For rolls we got a bunch and they were all good!!! We got the (1) Escondido (my favorite) which was shrimp tempura, crab, cucumber, tuna, salmon, eel, avo, topped with spicy aioli, eel sauce, & potato crunches; (2) The Centipede which was shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, cucumber, topped with avocado & balsamic glaze; (3) Orange County which was spicy crab, cucumber, topped with salmon, avocado, and yuzu essence, and finally a standard crunchy roll which was shrimp tempura, crab, cucumber, tempura flakes and soy glaze

If I had any complaint it would be that the rolls weren't rolled very well so they fall apart big time but the taste, service, and reasonable price will get me to go back there< /review>

We stopped by after a show at the art center. It was ok, nothing unique or signature about the place. We won't ever come by this place again. The decor was nice as well as the seating arrangement. It was also clean but the for the food it just was not worth it.</text>

I gave it 4 because the staff is SO rude! However, they have lots of permanently half price rolls. They're super tasty and I've never been sick from eating there. They desperately need to update their patio and they don't open the patio until the dinner rush. So if u go there right when they open, they probably won't let you sit out there.<//review>

food was ok service was horrible... we were a party of 6 and they added top on our checks which was fine the first time when we asked they said because it was a party of 6 and then they gave a senior discount. the next time we went they added more of a tip and no discount.</Review>

I've been coming here for over two years now. Love the food. Occasionally it is slow going but on the whole the wait staff has been great. Last time we ate dinner there we met the owner and he was very friendly. I am going with a group of 10 friends this Sunday before we see a show at the arts center. Should be a great night.</review>

Great local place, relaxed and friendly staff who remember you. 2 people will cost about $50 for a few rolls, apps and something more. Well worth the money for a great, everyday dinner place.</Review>

My husband and I discovered this spot a while back. Started out going to the Escondido location and here and there we also frequent the Carlsbad location. Fish is always fresh and they're pretty good about the consistency of their recipes. Only thing that isn't consistent is the service. We've waited up to 45min before getting our food at the Escondido location. And forget the pleasantries if you're ordering over the phone for pickup. In other words sit at the bar given the option, the chefs there are usually always on top of their game.<//Text>

One of the few sushi restaurants in Escondido, and in my opinion one of the better ones at a reasonable price. I like there service there and the dynamic duo is one of my favorite sushi rolls.<//review>

<Review>I am the host of Sushi Smackdown TV Show and events. I travel from city to city to find the best sushi restaurants to recommend and hold events. If you haven't experienced Sushi Yama yet, I highly recommend you too. I have tasted more sushi than the average sushi lover because of my show. Sushi Yama is truly a fantastic sushi restaurant.</Review>< Pictures>

This place is really a hit or a miss. Some days the food is amazing others it is bad. The taste is good but there is no quality control. Rolls fall apart before you can get it in your mouth. The fried rice has massive blotches of unseasoned white rice in it.<//text>

Loved the sushi! Super fresh and tasty, unique menu w different types of rolls and other Japanese style cuisine there. Me and my friend had a wonderful ladies nite there. We also partook in some bubble delicious cold sake! It was a very fun nite. Loved the atmosphere of the place. Very chill. Nice and clean. The service was awesome. Loved the staff there! They had great recommendations for sushi to eat.< /text>

<review>Really good sushi, but bad tempura(tried twice, both times soggy), and I would say I have some kind of issue with Sushi Yama's customer service 80% of the time I visit. The issues span from hostess attitude to extremely slow service, to not answering the phone for customer calls. Not big enough problems to stop coming in because the location is convenient, but also nothing I would drive any distance to dine.</review>< Pics>

Wasabi, ginger, and small salad should be part of the seating process.  For how busy the place seems they kinda lag it.  Higher priced but tasty as it should be though seems put together a bit sloppy. Not bad but not what I'd come back for.<//review>

Sushi Yama has to be one of the best Sushi places Ive ever been to! I suggest sitting at the bar because if its busy the waiters take a while...we recently moved out of state and would come back to cali just to eat here! We miss it so much!<//review>

Service was poor. Menus just shoved in our face with no words said. The green tea tasted like dirty feet. Food was overpriced for such a small run down place. Small portions. Don't waste your money or time at this place.<//review>

Service was not very good. Parking is bad. Portions are huge. It tastes pretty good. Not very traditional, or made traditionally. I sat at the counter.  If you are looking for someone with the traditional 7 years sushi rice training, this is not the place. I really doubt it. The gentleman use plastic wrap to shape their sushi roles. They forgot one of our roles and served it a good 20 minutes after we finished our others. I asked for my check when food was delivered. took another 10 minutes to give it to me AFTER we finished eating. We were going to the theater afterwards. I dinno. If you are a teenager or a drunk person and want a fun place to hang, cool. The atmosphere was cool. It has value. My 16 year son thought it was good. He enjoyed himself.</text>

I was really close to going with 3 because the price.  BUT, the quality of the sushi brought it back to 4.  They have Groupons almost everday and the quality of the food is worth the visit.  Expect to pay a decent amount if you don't have a coupon BUT, the food makes up for it in a HUGE way.   Great place to visit as this is one of our go-to spots for Sushi in Escondido.< /Text>

Costumer service was great and Food comes out fast and most importantly fresh! I've tried some japanese restaurants with my wife and this is the best place weve had so far. The sushi was fresh and very delicious. So as the other items in the menu. This place is a must try for couples and for families.< /Text>

Good food, friendly service and not a traditional Sushi place. Very busy on Friday nights, but not a long wait to be seated.<//review>

I asked whether they have any lunch specials and was told go to the website and look at two star menu items... okay fine...

So I did, and called back and was told that specials are for dine in only.  Guess I won't be eating here ever!!!  and as far as I'm concerned they don't have time to help customers nor are they trained on proper etiquette on the phone.  I will go to one of the other 5 Sushi restaurants in Escondido and gladly spend my money there.

Thanks for nothing!</Review><gmap_id>0x80dbf49916bcf835:0x782bfebf9e42aad6< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I've gone there several times and I always enjoy the food, normally they are good about serving us. Today it took way too long before someone rushed over (not at a busy hour either) to get our orders, someone who was busing tables was watching the tv. I finished my roll and my friend offered me one of hers, I took it and found what I believe to be mouse poop on it. My friend is sensitive so I said nothing of it, I would like to have the health department go look at the restaurant...as we were leaving there was a dead cockroach in the fountain.< /review>

Been coming here for years. The food is always excellent the service is the only reason this doesn't get the fifth star. The service is not consistent, usually with the waitresses not being attentive, and long wait times. The price is great for the quality of food, worth the wait and shoddy service.</review>

Ordered a 70.00 take out order and when I arrived, the wait staff had me sitting and waiting an extensive amount of time even though my order was ready.  Plus they still forgot shrimp sauce even though I asked multiple times to ensure it was in the bags.  The rolls tasted ok, but were made horribly and didnt stay together.  The miso soup and spicy calamari was awesome though, so they get a star for that alone. Honestly, I expected much more. Wont be returning and I recommend you spend your money elsewhere.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><GmapID>0x80dbf49916bcf835:0x782bfebf9e42aad6< /GmapID></record>

I check their website to see if they allowed dogs and they do in the patio area, so we called to make sure and they said yes.  when my girlfriend and I arrived there, the stupid guy said that he wasn't going to open the patio just for us because work was slow that day. We though it was F**king rude and Lazy so we went to a different sushi place near the Escondido movie theater,  the lady was kind and told us that they didn't allowed pet but since it was very slow she was ok with it. So shushi yama  you need better staff that fallows your own rules n regulations.<//Review>

Wth... They close at 2 :30 pm.. How do you make business. Me and my son got thete at 2:25 and they couldn't even take my order. The guys thought it was funny because the girls said oh.. We are closing sorry we can't take your order. The girls look like they were rushing to close. Never again ordering from this place.</Review>
