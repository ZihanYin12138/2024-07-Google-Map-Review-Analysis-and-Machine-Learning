Wow! What an amazing winery! Lisa our wine taster was literally the best, really adding the human element makes all the difference to the experience. The wine was phenomenal but having great service really elevates everything.< /review>

Opening a Le Vigne is like approaching a door into a realm yet unexplored. Let it breathe, while you're at it take a deep breath for yourself because you're about to put a slice of goat cheese on your argot that's somewhere between high dessert pasture and Falfurrias. At the risk of tossing a drink in your face...wake up and sniff the purple end of the cork dude.< /text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Love love love this place. The whole staff is incredible. We were greeted as we walked up from the parking lot and given probably the best hospitality I can remember from any winery. We sat outside and had the picnic pack which had a cheese assortment with meat and olives. We also ordered a bottle of wine and had the signature pizza, it was the perfect lunch.  John, Pat and Barry were too nice and made our visit feel special. They also surprised us with a little desert that was so delicious. After lunch we got a tour of the winery and roamed around the grounds and checked out the train cars they have and the swan in their pond. We will definitely be back. Highly recommend this place, it will not disappoint.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpAaLrZjfDLJCfDXzYhEYuhP0kOPJGRmn5Yfaq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYQRADPwfPeLgYljkSUBLdwE-fuqNTu_qgK8EJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPt1wkQKOjLwJTxJ-KLWR9QDudnenuwSR-ZPn-A=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2ouNs1uJseDHnpFux_mH5qo3rdSIuBgeh1DTA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPja8MKDHkwWFDzFUsYav2AVkie7zjmnrBYv0A-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPni5iJY5-lzu8uFPM2NnIC2yVhyTiyEIxB86t=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOl7dCVmLMBd5AJMfXk3X2NBPZ-h2bTe2zNXgFU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

They only had the patio open which was cool and all except it was over 100 degrees outside and very uncomfortable. Besides that everything was outstanding. Our sommelier was Pat and she was excellent! We had the wine flight with the cheese pairing and two pizzas. Everything was fresh and flavorful. Pat was very knowledgeable of the wines and history of the vineyard. We had a wonderful experience and can’t wait til this winery reopens fully.< /text></record>

I recommend adding the cheese to the wine tasting. Quite good. Wine tasting is $10 and the cheese adds another $5, but the wine tasting will be waived with the purchase of 2 bottles. I was quite impressed with the Tannan varietal. The Cab Sauv is quite good and affordable. The other wines are a bit steep and so I would probably give this place a 4.5 if possible.</review>< Pictures>

< review>
The owners and staff here are truly wonderful, and the wine very good. It's a small winery who truly cares about their products, which is refreshing since so many wineries in Temecula are so corporate. It's a very nice change from dealing with employees who would much prefer to be somewhere else, and not having to fight your way to the tasting bar (if you visit on a weekend). Also, they welcome dogs like most wineries should, but don't anymore if they're too corporate.<//review>

This place is not what it use to be. I've been a member of their club for over 4 years now and haven't been into the tasting room for 2 years. Always loved the wine and we order cases of it throughout the year. This past weekend I went into the tasting room with my parents and husband only for them to tell me that they could only comp 2 tastings. What type of wine club is this if the one time you make a special trip to go into the tasting room after spending thousands on their wine and they can't even comp a tasting. After arguing with the manager she finally agreed to it, after all when I signed the membership agreement it included 4 tastings. Super disappointed in what this winery has become.</text>

Looks nice,  customer service lacking.  I walked in, looked at wine selection, vat area, snack counter and was not greeted once by any staff, so I walked out and looked for another one.< /Review>

They do weddings and they have the perfect backdrop. Check out their Google Virtual Tour before you go.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>(Translated by Google) Their wines are excellent, the tasting is super complete and well served. The facilities are great and very well maintained. It is an exceptional place, the service is pleasant and pleasant, the someliers know what they are talking about and the wine tasting portion is generous.
Only one issue is there a lonely swan in a stream looks sad and poorly maintained

Sus vinos son excelentes, la degustacion es super completa y bien servida. Las instalaciones son estupendas y muy bien cuidadas. Es un lugar excepcional, el servicio es ameno y agradable los someliers saben de lo que hablan y la porción de vino en el "tasting" es generosa.
Solo un tema hay un cisne solitario en un arroyo se ve triste y mal cuidado< /review>< Pictures>

I have gone here a few times for parts, I don’t recommend them at all. They are very shady people. Stay as far from them as possible. They overcharge for parts and have no idea what parts are correct. I have bought one thing from them and I would rather drive to Chula Vista from now on than deal with these people.<//review>

<review>Trying to find a part in this place was crazy. I called up and they said all calls back in 30 minutes and then at the end of 30 minutes they have me call back in 45 minutes the end of 45 minutes they let me call back in another 30 minutes just to tell me they didn't have the part they couldn't check up until that final time to me that's no way to run a business!<//review>< Pictures>

When you need that piece of equipment that is too expensive the best option is coming here. You get a fair price and at the same time you can buy that refreshment you need because of that ramona weather.< /review>

Gave wrong part

Won't refund money unless u raise hell

Won't serve u if u point out their lack of integrity

I specifically told them that I won't a part from a particular car and instead they went and took it from a older model and I spent two day in the heat working for nothing, then they won't serve me and laugh about knowingly I have no car to go down the hill... what illegal jerks<//Review>

<user_id>110739370247767763318< /user_id><Text>Supercuts is a easy quick place to get your hair cut if you do not want to pay a lot of money.  The area is out of the way and not regularly visited.  The staff is low and when it gets busy there can be a wait.  The hairdressers do a good job, did not have a problem and the haircut was what was asked for.  There are options if you want to get a little fancier such as the Tea Tree Special Wash (additional cost).  They wash your hair and massage your scalp while a warm towel is placed on your face.  It is a nice little indulgence that is not very costly.</Text></record>

Clean,  organized, temp check at the door.

Couldn't check in on line. called in, secured an appt.  Quick,  appt. No wait.  Added the tea tree shampoo treatment, nice addition.  Very relaxing,  smells great.  Shampoo chair had massage feature.  Warm towel at the end,  mini face- neck massage. Worth it.  Hair cut was nice too,  lady named Soledad had a good hand,  didn't cut too much.<//review>

Excellent customer service. I had my long hair cut into a short, layered bob. Very pleased with the cut. Thank you Supercuts. This just proves you can get a great haircut without spending $60.00.< /Text>

Spacious and clean. I ask the lady if she could cut my son's ethnic hair. She answered yes, and ask how I wanted his hair. I have a very brief description and she nailed it.
My son was happy, so I topped big and she was happy.
Oh happy day.</Text>

Some of the stylists are great and some are horrible. It is hard to know what your final cut will look like.</Text>

<text>Terrible expensive place. Some of the gals in there do a half assed job, and that's for a simple buzzcut, they don't even bother to get the long hairs with the scissors. Some of the older women are good though. But I won't go back again, last time my fiance went in for a simple buzzcut, he was left with long hairs on the sides and bottom almost 20 bucks and then the hair dresser had the audacity to say "So where's my tip?" -her exact words. Very unprofessional and greedy. You only get tips if you actually try to do your best, even if it's just for a buzzcut.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x808dff25f8113409:0x92cb64c32e28f221</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Dreading having to take my car in for a smog check, I was lucky to stop by Star Station Smog check where Raul and KD made the process absolutely painless and stress-free. Quick and efficient, I was seen right away as a walk-in and the inspection took about 15 minutes total!

I also felt very safe with COVID protocols being followed and outdoor seating available while I waited.<//Text>

< Review>
This is the only place I've ever taken my car for my biennial smog check. As the name implies, it is a Star certified check station. They only do smog checks and not repairs. Gary is very knowledgeable and runs a tight shop. Even without an appointment I was in and out within twenty minutes. The technician, Kevin, was respectful, wore a mask, answered some of my questions regarding OBD2 monitors readiness. The shop offers a free retest within 14 days, or a 50% discount on your smog check after that time period. I'm always a little anxious and stressed out before getting my check, but it is a good feeling of relief to leave with that certificate that says "Passed". I would whole-heartedly recommend these guys!<//Review>

< review>
I called in on a Sunday at 1pm just to inquire.  Kevin told me he could get me in ASAP, for an affordable price with free re-test! I came through and sure enough 10 minutes later I’m done! I called 2 other places before that were more expensive and had no free re-test.

These guys are fast, affordable, and courteous! Never thought I’d have such a nice experience at a smog station! Can’t believe they’re open on Sunday’s too! Definitely recommend, will be back.<//review>

Ala and KB we’re polite. And even better for me, quick! No time wasted. I appreciate the station providing a discount for checking in on Yelp! I’m young and don’t have the best job. Every saving is a blessing!< /Review>

I got two vehicles from out of state smogged here to get CA registration. They were quick and professional, no problems. This place is next to a good gas station shop with access to a spacious outdoor waiting area. Pull directly up to the dock and they'll take care of you. By the time you buy a coffee at the gas station and sit down to check your phone, they'll be all done.<//review>

I was recommended this place by my father, and it was a great recommendation! KB and Alla helped me out today - they were super quick, polite, and made the process very easy. They also had measures for sanitization in place pretty well, so also a plus. Thanks guys!<//Review>

Called Star Station Smog to see if they had an immediate opening and they told me to head over. Met Kevin who told me they'd take care of me in 15 minutes and he did it in 10. Solid, efficient outfit, definitely recommend and will use them in the future for my smog needs.</Review>

They told me 10 minutes but got done in 7! Such awesome service KB and Tim were excellent service technician for my visit. I called in to see if they weren’t busy and Tim told me to come through. As soon as I got there Tim Politely asked for my keys and KB kindly invited me to the desk. Gave my license to him he checked me in and I waited no time at all and I left there with flying colors and virtually no time wasted ! I highly recommend this establishment and it’s grade A service to any an all!

Smog check was done adequately. But then the owner told me to give him a 5 star review for a $10 discount, which is against FTC advertising rules.< /text>

Went it for a SMOG inspection and the guy told me they had me on camera and if he messed up my car he wouldn’t be held responsible. After questioning him some more he told me he wasn’t comfortable driving an older car and wouldn’t be held responsible if he “messed up my car”. Unbelievable poor service and I would caution anyone who is considering going here, to find a different place to go.< /Text>

Just joined a month ago. The price is right, the equipment are nice & clean, locker room is clean, staffs are courteous but most of all I love the free 10 min “Hydro massage” after the work out! Thumbs up 👍< /Review>

<Time>1608058147144<//Time><rate>1< /rate><Review>Do not trust what this company says. I spoke with a representative about MAYBE joining their gym. This was during the first lockdown. I never authorized any membership renewal and I had not even been a member for over three years prior to this. During lockdown they had informed me they would open up (which was a lie) and I said I’d agree to a new membership AFTER they opened.

Anyway, without my approval they have charged me $66! And this was months after I had spoken to them. I contacted their financial department and they refuse to give me a refund. Despite the fact that I have never once entered their gym! This is a shady thieving company. DO NOT TRUST THEM.

I was a member of anytime fitness and 24 hour fitness at this time. Those companies have always been forthright and honest, but fitness19 has proven to be a lying backwards company that deserves to lose any honest person’s  business.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

👍🏼Pros: affordable, clean, no attitude/bad vibes from anyone, great yoga class, great location, nice & friendly staff, feels like I “belong” and everyone is on the same good path making themselves healthier. LOVE the hydro massage chair - it’s a treat for me after working out!
👎Not “cons” exactly but if I had my way, I’d make these things happen: Wish it was open past 7pm on weekends, Wish there were more classes in the 7:00pm time slot, and there are no HOOK in the shower for your towel so you have to put it on the floor.< /Review>< gmapID>

<user_name>Nicole</user_name><review>They make it super easy to sign up and virtually impossible to cancel. I am now a happy member at 24 Hour Fitness! But then again, you get what you pay for. Cheap membership equals cheap customer service. They lied about how to cancel membership telling me to come, I did and was told to do it online. Did that and emailed proof of cancellation to Jake & mgmt and they still disputed it! Couldn't even get a call back. I was a member for 5 years! Horrible thieves!

The facilities are kept very clean, the staff is extremely friendly, and the Red light therapy, Hydro Massage and Tanning being included for a paltry $25 a month? PLUS, you can bring a friend any time on the weekends?? How could I NOT give this place a 5 🌟 rating?!!! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Decent gym, fair price and the boss went out of the way to put up a bunch of TVs. The staff need training on consistently putting the TVs on the same channels for a better customer experience.  There is no procedure or standard I’m sure.  Considering just streaming from my phone like the other customers. What a waste of resources Luvermore</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Perfect sized with a good selection. I like to go in the mornings, choose an elliptical in front of the TV playing CBS news and zone for a half hour.  Without asking a staff member walks up and changes the channel and turns around to ask if anyone was watching. When I said yes he pointed to another TV with the same channel and said I could turn my head.  Would recommend staff be retrained on changing equipment on the very equipment the customers are using.  Bad form, I was offended< /Review>

I just started working out Livermore's Fitness 19 about a month and a half ago. Since starting a new gym is a bit intimidating, I signed up for personal training sessions with Max. I'm so glad I did. Not only did Max help me with a meal plan, but he taught me how to use the equipment for my fitness level. He taught me so much about strength training and how to increase difficulty as I progress. He was very kind and motivating. I was impressed with his knowledge level and experience for such a small gym. If you have the means to sign up for sessions, I highly recommend Max as a trainer.

I was also impressed with the amount of equipment the gym has. I've worked out at larger, more expensive gyms and found all of the same equipment here - at a fraction of the cost.<//text>

My review is comparing my experience with other Fitness 19 in the TriValley area. I prefer the Livermore location, though I feel there's less amenities compared to other locations, is bc there's a spinning class, for the most part, there's parking!, and there's enough space and lockers to change. There's the basic equipments and TVs. You have just the basics and it's clean.</text>

<review>It's a really clean and well equipped gym, tons of workout machines, so you don't have to wait to get on a treadmill or something. The base membership's $25/month, but keep your eyes out for deals, I got in for $10/month. There isn't any WiFi available, so that's kind of a bummer, but other than that I'm quite happy. Since it's around downtown Livermore, after your workout, you can grab dinner or groceries at the nearby Safeway.</review>< Pictures>

Edit: Women's bathroom is still gross... Moldy grout & corners have wads of hair, etc - they just don't clean this place thoroughly, but they keep their new shelves of protein powder/t shirts stocked up! My 3 yr. old said, "Mommy, don't sit on the toilets, they're dirty!" and she was right. Liners don't protect against soiled seats. This place is all about getting more members, not keeping the ones they have. We discontinued our membership. Check out the nice 24 Hour Fitness at 580 & Airway - puts this place to shame! We joined & it's worth the extra money. Kids love it there, we can work out now without worrying about them getting sick from lack of cleanliness. Costco offers $26/mth memberships!

Bathrooms always dirty & toilets get plugged up a lot & sit for days or even weeks without being fixed. It's gross. Never seen a professional cleaning service in that place no matter when my husband & I go. Many machines need repair. Pulleys skip & don't move smoothly, pads are worn, seats are loose & wiggle. Only 2 water fountains for the entire gym. Lots of employees sit around &  talk to each other instead of working. Only good thing is cheap price. Our family is going to quit this gym soon. Babysitting area needs to be cleaned more often, we're not comfortable bringing our 2 kids here anymore. Old toys need cleaning, never smells clean in there. We don't recommend this gym.</review>

They tried out one day and realised they didn't understand the equipment.  So I came in today I was so annoyed with the attitude of one of the employees (.his name was JOSE). I promise neither I nor my friends will ever join your gym.
He didn't ask us if we had any try out passes or not, He straight away demanded $5 to work out for the day. I told him I was only their to help my friend understand the equipment. Even though I had my try out pass, I was so disgusted with his attitude I just left.

<Review>I at the beginning of an 12 week exercise program at  lifestyle RX in Livermore.
I wish to combine my membership with you.
I will have a PT intro session this Friday at 11Am.
I have been using your gym for a couple of weeks and find that
my favorite machine is the leg extension. There is only one working this morning and the person using it was on at least 30 minutes.
It can be very difficult to work out there.

I’ve had the sugar twists, crumb, coconut, iced coffee and today their bran muffin.
I’m not a fan of the coconut but my friend is.
Over all I enjoy paying this little shop a visit</review>

Went specifically for the muffins. Got the blueberry. Only a few blueberries inside and it was dry. Very disappointing for $2.<//review>

Food seems to be tasty, but too processed. Even simple coffee contains sugar. Only for sweet tooth. M size standard coffee is about 500 ml!<//Text>

<Text>Ordered a bacon and egg croissant sandwich. A thin piece  of egg with microwave bacon.
I go to pay he says my card is declined.
So turn to his atm probably owned by him with the same card and get 20 out but a 2.50 charge.
Pretty sneaky.  I won't return. Lame<//Text><user_name>RAWGER A</user_name>< user_id>

Unfortunately I didn’t get a chance to try their donuts because of the very rude man that works late at night. I think he is the owner. I hate to bring race into it but he really treated me rudely from the moment I walked in and I know it was because of the color of my skin. I walked in at like 11pm asked for a dozen donuts holes and realize I left my wallet in the car so I say hold on one sec I have to run to the car and get my wallet. So I do and come back in a and noticed he didn’t even get the donuts I order ready but I didn’t pay it any mind. We then proceeded to the register. I have a card with a chip and after he asked me to swipe my card and it didn’t work I said I have a chip and got ready to insert my card. He then says “your card has no money” I said of course it does I crust have a chip so it we just have to try again he grabs the donuts off the counter and then says “your card has no money” again. All this and the total is just $1.75. I am so upset because I live in the area and now have to avoid going to the closet donut shop to my house that’s open 24 hours because the owner is a RACIST JURK! I would never go back and would give him 0 stars if I could!< /Text>

15 minutes to get a grocery-store bagel? Really?

Great pizza, but not a lot per pie. If you're looking to eat some heavy/hearty pizza this is not the spot. If you're not too hungry and looking for a tasty pizza where the toppings are not evenly spread, this is the place. Honestly, great pizza, but just keep min mind that they're very small, which is fine with me sometimes.< /Text>

During COVID, great sidewalk dining area. Good beer selection. Pizza was absolutely delicious - we had the #1 (prosciutto, arugula, mushroom) and #4 (pepperoni, sausage, mushroom). Highly recommend</review>

<review>Pizzas here are great, service is a little slow right now as I'm guessing they're understaffed due to the pandemic, but they're all very kind and apologetic for the delays in service.<//review>< pics>

A tiny hole in the wall. Not much for decor. Small menu, but everything we had was great, and everything we saw at other tables looked great. I had the sausage and onion pizzetta, which is worth going back for.< /text>

This is one of my favorite spots in SF.

The pizza is fantastic (admittedly the only thing I've ordered aside from cheesecake which was also great). Thin crust, fantastic toppings like house made sausage, wild mushrooms, and Humboldt Fog goat cheese.

The owner used to be in the beer/wine business and always has a fantastic rotating selection of draft beers.

But on top of the actual food and drink, the environment at Kezar is incredible. I used to live in the neighborhood and would be there multiple times a week; nowadays, I try make the trek to Cole Valley every week to catch up with all the other regulars who I have gotten to know (including the owner Basim, who is a wonderful guy). There are TVs to watch the game, and there's usually great conversation to be had there if you're looking for it too. I can't count the number of times I've wandered into Kezar alone and left beaming after an unexpectedly great chat.

They have a large space in the back for big groups! Sometimes this place gets randomly swamped with a party of like 20 in the back which can hold up service, but otherwise service is prompt and friendly; the staff are all really kind.

If I ever leave the city, this is a place that I will always associate with SF. It is a special place; it feels like there aren't many establishments like this in SF nowadays. Definitely worth a visit, maybe I'll see you there sometime!</text>

A great draught beer selection served just the way beer is supposed to be served. Local breweries are always well represented and I'm thrilled to often see Fieldwork on tap.

The food is pizza with quality ingredients, with some solid appetizer and salad options (go for arugula!). The happy hour pizza deal (2 toppings 8" I believe) with a $1 off pint is a great treat at the end of the day.

TVs show whatever game is one but it doesn't feel like a sports bar. A very unique ambiance (see giant saltwater fish tank!). The lounge in the back is great for larger groups.<//review><Rating>5< /Rating><gmap_id>0x80858750b04130b5:0xa9c074f96b8d54a7< /gmap_id></record>

I love this place SO MUCH. The first time I came here, I actually thought it was a bar from the outside. When I walked in I realized my mistake, but opted to stay anyway because it looked like they had some beer on tap. I'm so glad I did. They not only have incredible craft beers on tap (especially some heavy and delicious stouts/porters for those dark beer fans), they have a HUMBOLDT FOG PIZZA. If that doesn't sell you on this place I don't know what will.
The ambience is sort of strange here, but in the most charming way. There's a massive aquarium in the middle of the room that divides the place in half, a great but small bar that serves wine and some of the best tasting beer I've had in the bay, there's almost always a gaggle of circus performers from the circus school next door hanging out in the back unwinding after their classes, and the bar plays the strangest selection of music—sometimes it's EDM, sometimes 90's garage rock, you just never know. Oh, and the best damn pizza on earth, that mean Humboldt Fog Pizza. Definitely check it out, it's such a great little undiscovered gem of the inner sunset/ashbury/cole valley area.</review>

Third time here and just have to get a quick rating up here as it's quickly becoming one of my favourite spots. The quality of food and ingredients is so high for what otherwise appears to be a quintessentially perfect neighborhood bar. There used to be more places like this in San Francisco that were comfortable, welcoming, unpretentious, somewhat quirky (e.g. fish tank), and second to none in quality.

I have a birthday coming up and can't think of any place I'd rather invite 20 friends meet at to eat, drink and laugh. There's a loungey area in the back that seems perfect for such a meet up...

Anyways, go there and help keep places like this open in SF.< /review>

Our family had gone into the City for an afternoon at Ft Funston Beach with our dog. We then headed over to the Koret Playground and Carousel at Golden Gate Park. Hungry, we looked for place for dinner. This place was perfect for our family which included two grandchildren (6 and 3 years). A local gathering spot with excellent food, great happy hour prices, and wonderful staff. We’ll make it a regular stop when in this part of the City. Has the feel of a British neighborhood pub, i.e. a true local gathering spot for any kind of family.< /review>

<text>Waitstaff was polite. Interesting atmosphere (almost like a sports bar with a mini hookah lounge in the back). "Pizzetta" was a bit over-priced (the garlic bread was DEFINITELY over-priced!) but good, nonetheless. The menu  is also a bit small, but they have the option to build-your-own personal pizza to make up for it.< /text><UserId.>103276928141800969892</UserId.><gmapID>0x80858750b04130b5:0xa9c074f96b8d54a7<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The hidden gem of the Inner Sunset. This pizzeria is our favorite in the neighborhood, and surprisingly usually has soccer for a last-minute meal.

Some of our favorites include the Kale Pizzeta and the Goat Cheese Salad. The pizza crust is perfectly salted and crisp. We've taken several friends here and so far they've all loved it!< /review>

<text>The beer selection over the SF Beer Week was really great. We also ordered the cheese pizza topped with arugula. One of the best pizzas in town. I love this neighborhood joint, almost a hidden gem on Lincoln.<//text>< Pictures>

My fiance and I eat here far too often and it's worth it.   Food is superb and the staff are always so friendly.  It's truly one of those neighborhood gem types that instill a great sense of community for our neighborhood.  Kezar pizzetta feels as much as home as our own kitchen - truly a comfort!< /text>

So many people here complaining about it...
Anyway, they're there to help you if you help yourself. It's a free program and free job training. You meet people in similar walks of life and its in SD County, where there is a lot more Job Opportunities than other places.
The only reason for the four stars is because other students who don't take the program seriously can ruin it for others. Make friends, but stay away from the idiots.< /Review>

San Diego Job Corps was a great experience for me. I only needed a couple more classes to graduate, so I was able to get my High School Diploma in a short amount of time. At the same time while earning my diploma, I took courses that provided real work experience. I was able to land a great job immediately after graduating.<//review>

<Review>Helps you get your life in order,if you want to get out of your comfort zone and get the things you need in order to survive and you if you lack the social,academic and basic living skills. I highly recommend this program. And this is coming from someone that lived with their parents until 21  I'm almost 22 and getting everything that I need in a very short amount of time. Stop wasting time and get it together here!!!!!!!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<review>I had mostly ups and a few downs, but over all,  I would not trade the experience for anything! Made great friends and was able to grow as a person, both socially and intellectually. Served as President of the Honor Dorm with Robert Romero and Jimmy Minh Ho as my roommates and Ron was our RA (now he is running the place!) and he was always supportive and a great leader. If someone passes up the chance to experience SDJC, they don't know what they are missing!<//review>< pictures>

I graduated with 2 trades and I was on the honor roll program etc.  If you want to feel sorry for yourself or be in a gang then you will never survive. You have to go with the program and that means RESPECT.Yes the dorms are not the best BUT guess what it is FREE. You also have to realize this was a MILITARY base one time.  You have to earn your privileges  to get off campus except on wknds. And yes they can and will even take that away. Everyone has to wear their badges everywhere they go. You eat when it is meal time and you are told when to go to bed.
I was in the honor roll dorm which was the nicer one and my dorm monitor was cool. We had dances on campus. The pay was not great when I went in 1990, and you even get a clothing allowance and free medical, dental and vision. weekends people went off  campus for the day, went to the beach, mall etc. they have a van that will drop you  off at the trolley. And if really needed $$$ you could go sell Plasma.  we were allowed stereos in our dorms. This is  a GOVT program and they have every right to kick you out if you do not follow the program rules< /review>< pics>

<Review>I attended SDJC and was SGA president, dorm presdient, student leader and on the CRB board. Got my HS DILPOMA AND GED, Got my CNA AND BAM Certicate. They feed you, give you money, a place to sleep and give you many amenities! The program will only work if you work for the program! 💯 Made friends and met mad people that I am still in touch with these days. 2000-2002 graduated!!< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<review>I went there for about a month and I really didn't like it, the rules where a little to dramatic and the schedules where absurd, I left and about 2 weeks later I heard about ccc the California Conservation Corp, in my opinion it is way better to be a ccc member than to live in jc, ccc offers residential and non res that's completely up to you whether u need a place to stay or just work, I would suggest working at ccc than going to jc<//review>< Pictures>

< review>
I am live about 3 ours away from San Diego, originally. I went in 2012, and I loved it! But i ended up getting homesick, and the program i did, was very short. I didn't feel like i would have been equipped for the job. I loved living there because, it's, one, san diego. lol Two, its free and three, I met awesome people. I wish i had stayed for another trade, but I continued my studies in my hometown, and have joined the military. One day I will head back to san diego again. :) It is not a horrible school, you just have to stay away from drama and BS. Stay focused and get what you went there for. Its like a vacation if you aren't from that area lol seriously. I also recommend do everything and anything you can while you are there, because SD never gets boring.</review>

for some odd reason it seems like tha only good reviews are written by jst google users and that makes me think, is tha staff or people who work there are giving those reviews to give there selve a name to get more students ?? tha reviews seem more scripted more than anythhing just my opinion if anyone have word on this please repost or reply i really am interested in knowing others opinions on this  !!

I love the wine, and the space that Kim and George have created.  BHWinery feels like a neighborhood cafe meets a retreat from reality.  Wonderful vibes and delicious vintages!  Try the wine club for a fabulous experience every quarter!<//review>

The grounds are beautiful. There's a nice rooftop deck with great views. All wines we tasted we're great except the Montepulciano. Owners were friendly.  6 tastes for $15.

Had to dock a couple of stars because COVID mask adherence inside the small tasting room inside and bar was non existent. There are several places outside that are safe to taste but you have to go in briefly to refill.</text>

<review>This place is a hidden gem in the hills of Morro on the borders of Oceanside and Fallbrook.  The owners Kim and George are warm and welcoming creating a 'family' atmosphere.  Their passion for wine making shows in the many varietals they produce.  There is a wine for all; from those just beginning on their wine tasting journey to the most discriminating palate.  The top deck patio allows for a relaxed wine tasting experience only exceeded by the break taking 360 degree views.  Beach House Winery is a MUST when in north county.<//review>< Pics>

<user_name>Texas T<//user_name><Date>1600044879396</Date><review>visited this winery recently.  It was quite a challenge finding where they are.  The views from this winery are special.  Our wine tasting experience was very nice.  We met the wine maker.  We tasted 6 wines for $15 which is NOT refunded if you buy any bottle.  The inside of the tasting room is very nice and welcoming.  The server who was helping out could be a bit friendlier and/or tell more about the grapes/wines other than what's on the menu.  These days most of us could benefit more from how wine is made, etc.  Montelpuciano and their Blend were the best wines for me.  We thought of joining their wine club which gives you some perks but only if you live in this area or can get to this area often.  They run sales on their cases if you buy their 2013 vintages at 50%.  Not sure if this sale is just now or always.  I really appreciated the owner/winemaker coming over to chat with us and tell us more about the wines/grapes.  The guy pouring was only pouring.<//review><gmapID>0x80dc79f4c7f4a999:0x6b7146212f532f67</gmapID><rating>4<//rating></record></dataset><record>

Lovely location with great views and ambiance.  Unfortunately the wine is foul.  They all tasted like brand new wines without any aging - horrible after taste.</text>

<name>Jack McElroy< /name><text>My Lady friend Kathy and I tasted wine here in 2018 while visiting in Oceanside.
I recall that parking was a bit of an issue at that time. We really enjoyed this stop. It has a great view from the hillside of the surrounding area. At that time, my favorite wine was the Malbec, and lucky me, they had cases on sale at 40% off. A great wine. My daughter and her husband love it and I give them bottles for their birthdays. Would like more of same !< /text><time>1595796729466< /time>< pictures>

Very cute little winery in the middle of Fallbrook.

Some wines are very good. Don't miss out on the petite syrah.<//review>

The tasting room and surroundings are lovely.

It is such a treat to find a vineyard and winery so close to the city.

Well worth a visit  We will definitely visit again.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc79f4c7f4a999:0x6b7146212f532f67<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>An Oceanside secret to share. I sometimes forget how many hidden gems Oceanside has to offer and this is one of them. You can get your wine tasting fix without having to go very far if you already live in North County. This location grows their own grapes and has a pretty wide selection of varietals to taste, some of which I believe were sourced elsewhere. Don't quote me on that.

The atmosphere is chill and the traffic is steady but not stuffy. Depending on how busy the owners are, you can get some quality time with them and learn about how their winery came to fruition. It's a nice story. The deck is open and has views of the land. I tried looking for Jason Mraz's house but couldn't quite see it. Wink.

4 stars because I would have like to see a better snack selection. I know... it's a winery, but there is nothing else near, no food or stores and while I often bring my own food, I still like to have something extra available. I'm a convenience seeker.

Prices are fair and this is a great date spot.< /Review>< user_name>

<Text>This is a small winery in the Bonsall area.  They are located at a private residence and the tasting room is a converted garage.  There is very limited parking in front of the garage and no actual parking lot.  The wine is ok. What is really nice about this location is the roof top patio with amazing views and the owners are very friendly.<//Text>< Pics>

This is a wonderful place with a great selection of wines.  The views from the rooftop are stunning.  I am glad I had a chance to visit and do a wine tasting.  It is such a gorgeous and calm place, it was totally worth the drive from Encinitas.  I enjoyed talking to the owners and guests and purchased two bottles of most perfect white and red.   A tip that I'd like to share is grab some food with you if you come for a tasting.  Other than that, I'm already planning my trip back. :)<//text>

Outstanding wine! You get to meet the owners who are the winemakers. Much better and more personal experience than the larger wineries.</Text>

I have routinely opted for this tire shop since moving nearby as they have always provided the best service, at a fair price, and have had the right used tire for my tire requirements. Their service is very much appreciated!< /review>

Most amazing level of service. Educated me on methods of birth control and is always available over the phone when needed. Dr. Banooni delivered my son 3 years ago and he exceeded my expectations. I always feel comfortable with him and all entire staff. I would never change him for any other doctor. I drive from Orange County to see him now.<//review>

<time>1613172668051< /time><review>It is always so lovely to see Dr. Banooni. Though I am now past my years of growing my family, I am grateful to have our annual check-ins. It's unusual in life to have a care provider who has been present for so many significant milestones and I am grateful to have benefited from such a unique continuity of care from Dr. Banooni. I deeply appreciate his level of personalized and focused attention. He's a gentle and kind man and an excellent and thorough physician and I'm delighted to see him be a positive role model for the residents lucky enough to have him as a  mentor. We need more doctors in the world who not only possess an excellent command of their specialty, but have also mastered an assuring and warm bedside manner. I couldn't recommend him highly enough.< /review>< GmapID>

I've been seeing Dr. Banooni for 18 years and he is absolutely amazing. He delivered my son 13 years ago and I never think twice about doing as he recommends when it comes to my health. He's patient, personable, relatable and has such a calm and friendly demeanor. I don't hesitate to come to him with any health concerns or for support. I would absolutely recommend him if you're looking for a great practitioner!<//review>

<Review>The staff is so friendly over the phone and in person, the entire team is so personable, helpful, and friendly. It was my first time seeing Dr. Melissa Gutierrez and I had many questions before even getting into the visit (like insurance etc) and they were so helpful. My wait time was under 20 min and Dr. Gutierrez was so sweet and comforting with my Health concerns. It was quick, easy, and she helped me with next steps. I can’t wait to see her again and become a regular of hers - good doctors are hard to come by!< /Review></record>

This was my first time seeing Dr. Banooni and I could not be happier with my experience. This is honestly the first time in the past 15 years where I’ve had a positive experience with an OBGYN. He is honest, he is attentive to your needs but also informative as to changes you may need based on your plans. I am looking forward to continuing care with him!

If you are looking for a new OBGYN, I definitely recommend him!< /Text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>This review is long overdue but Dr Banooni and his staff are AWESOME.  I was under his care from pre-pregnancy to postpartum.  At every step of the way, I was informed about all my options and was patiently tended to every time.  Because I have moved a lot, I have been a patient of several OB/GYN offices and I always felt rushed.  But I didn’t feel like that under Dr. Banooni’s care.  Another thing worth mentioning is that the nature of their business is reproductive care and baby deliveries, so I knew going in that on particular days, if there was a baby to deliver, there was a baby to deliver.  That means that as a patient of an office like that on those days, you have to expect rescheduling and longer waits.  When it is my turn to have my baby delivered, I would want the same attention.  What was special about Dr. Banooni’s office is that he actually was able to deliver my baby.  At other offices, you get the doctor available that day at the hospital.  Dr. Banooni also has an amazing bedside manner and his calm demeanor and composure made me confident about my pregnancy all the way.  Another great thing is that whenever I had a question when I called his office, I always got a call back from him.  I even had an emergency over the weekend and even received a call back from him promptly that same day.  I also want to mention that special help I got from Julie and Prisma during the times I needed it were very much appreciated.  They understood the immediacy of the care or issue I needed resolved and promptly came to my rescue.  I couldn’t recommend a better office for reproductive care.  Thank you so much Dr. Banooni and staff!</review>< user_name>

I'm a fairly new patient as all the other doctors I had at the practice, one by one, would not work with medicare. Not Dr Guitterez. And for that I am very grateful. And so far, I really like her way with me. I feel comfortable and sure.</Text>

I have been going to Dr. Banooni for over 10 years and he is very professional and good at answering all of my questions.  He is a good doctor and I recommend him to many people.  Sometimes the office staff would be slow in the past, but now in the current times, they get you into a room pretty fast.  I am still waiting on test results and an answer to a question I called in after the appointment from two weeks ago, but not sure if they are under staffed?</review>

Dr. Banooni is literally the best gyno in the world!  He’s beyond gentile, genuine, and literally delivered both my children with care.  I feel blessed to be his patient and even during COVID makes us feel safe.  The office is spotless.  He’s just the best!</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Dr. G had rather large shoes to fill in my opinion. I am former patient of Dr. Rabin, who has since retired. I trusted his judgement for over 25 years and two deliveries and was very sad upon learning of his unexpected retirement. After being in her care for close to two years I understand why he choose her when handing over the keys to his practice. Dr. G is smart and has a good bedside manner.</text>< Pictures>

Dr. Gutierrez is a terrific doctor who's knowledgeable and very responsive. I was able to get a same-day telehealth appointment and she was great at explaining things. I'd had my previous OB/GYN for 22 years until his retirement. I'm so glad I was able to find such a great replacement.<//text>

Dr. Banooni and his staff care about your comfort and experience. He and the nurses and MAs that assist him are warm, take their time with you answering all your questions, and never make you feel rushed.   Every once in awhile you may have to wait a bit longer bc he got called for an emergency delivery.  It occurs  with all OBGYN doctors, as it’s a major part of their purpose.  His care is worth the wait.<//review>

<text>I had a visit with Dr Gutierrez for the first time and I was so blown away with how quick and efficient everyone in the office was. I got 2 tests and an exam/consultation done in under 30 minutes, while Dr. Gutierrez also kindly explained everything in detail and answered all of my questions. She is also a very comforting individual that makes the overall OBGYN experience way nicer. I am very impressed and will definitely be coming back!</text>< Rate>

<Text>Dr Peyman Banooni is a knowledgeable and trustworthy doctor that I have been seeing for 6 or 7 years.  Covid-19 has him delivering many babies, but he still has time for his other patients, fortunately.  Better schedule your appointment, because it may take awhile to get in.

<Text>Dr. Banooni is amazing. Has such a calming demeanor to him. One of the things that is super important to me is the ability to get in contact with and to be able to see your doctor in a timely manner. My last OBGYN would take several weeks to even months to see even while pregnant, with Dr Banooni I can book an appointment within the same week.<//Text>< pictures>

I honestly cannot recommend Dr. Banooni enough! Sometimes going to the OBGYN can be a stressful experience, but I always know I am in good hands with him. His bedside manner is top notch, and I can tell he's extremely knowledgeable and is always looking out for my best interest. I started seeing him when I was 21, and I can only hope that some day he will guide me through pregnancy!

The employees in his office are always well organized and kind. I love their online portal that allows me to make appointments, view my test results, and ask questions through the messaging platform!<//text>

<review>Dr. Banooni is the best, if I could give him ten stars I would. He is my obgyn and delivered our healthy, beautiful baby girl two weeks ago today! He is so calm and made me feel so unsafe in uncertain waters. I'm 49 so I was a little nervous to be giving birth, but he made me feel as safe as he possibly could.  He and his team really checked and double checked all my and the baby's vitals to make sure everything was normal. To top it off, he's just a nice guy and a joy to be around.<//review>< Pictures>

I had to get in to see a gynecologist due to an emergency issue with my bladder/fibroids and Melissa was able to squeeze me into a very busy day 24 hours after I was in the ER. She was very informative and explained everything in a logical and concise way. I so appreciate the straight-forward approach and now have a few things to consider before making some important health related decisions. I highly recommend Melissa Gutierrez!<//Review>

I recently had my first examination with Dr. Melissa Gutierrez. She was very professional, thorough in her exam and extremely personable. I feel that Dr. Gutierrez has a great combination of high expertise and personal warmth, and it put me at ease. As a new patient, I was also very impressed with the Staff. They were all very helpful, attentive and caring. Although it appeared to be a busy office, it seemed to run very smoothly and very much on time.<//text>

Dr. Banooni is wonderful. He is knowledgeable with deep competence. That is most important to me. But he also is incredibly articulate and able to communicate clearly and concisely. He is efficient and effective and inspires great confidence. He is very professional and has a kind, compassionate bedside manner. His nurse Nora and phlebotomist Agnes too were professional, knowledgeable and kind. Dr. Banooni, his nurse Nora, his phlebotomist Agnes, his office staff, and his waiting area are peaceful and calm. Nora, Agnes, and his front office staff too are very kind, patient, and competent. Julie in the front office in particular was great in handling the voluminous medical records I brought with me to my first appointment and in addressing a question of great importance to me. I arrived on time and did not wait at all, which is extraordinary in my experience. I highly recommend Dr. Banooni and his nurse, phlebotomist, front office staff, and waiting area and exam rooms.< /review>

<text>Dr. Banooni is the best OBGYN I've ever had! I had an emergency cyst burst a few years ago and was trying to work with my previous doctors who immediately pushed for surgery to remove an ovary. Dr. Banooni came in with a non-surgical approach and it was ultimately the right option and of course best for my body. I've been seeing him ever since and he's kind, knowledgeable and I look forward to many years with him as my Dr.< /text>< Pictures>

Dr. Banooni is by far the best! He’s very knowledgeable, patient and a reliable doctor. I trust his judgement with no hesitation. He’s been a breath of fresh air. He’s very detailed about everything and make sure you get all your questions answered at each visit. His staff is fantastic as well.

I have heard by many that he’s the best in town and I’ve had first hand experience to know he truly is. I highly recommend him.< /review>

<gmap_id>0x80c2b95185af2b5f:0x2ee7a7923b14e24f< /gmap_id><Text>Dr. Banooni was negligent with me.  TWICE.  He unnecessarily caused me enormous pain, left me to languish in it and showed not an ounce of sympathy or concern when I let him know I was in pain over two months ago.  But that wasn't his first negligent action...

Three years ago, after we agreed on the SKYLA IUD due to my high estrogen and progesterone issues,  I woke up after having a polyp removed to find they put in a MIRENA IUD, which has 4 times the hormones.  I ended up with migraines within days, and they changed it a week later.  However, I was not given any explanation, or apology.  Just a rather condescending response, "I guess you know your own body."  Um, yeah, I'm not a doctor, nor some anti-vaxxing, anti-science freak, but I am medically informed.  I also expect that if we agree on inserting a SKYLA IUD because of my history of high estrogen and progesterone, I would hope I would wake up with a SKYLA inside me!  Seems reasonable, right?  But he was so well "respected" so I chalked it up to an honest mistake and let it go.  That was my mistake.  I should have left then and there.

I also had a history of fibroids, which I made sure to mention that they be monitored carefully since I already had a myomectomy at the age of 36 to remove several large fibroids.  Bottom line, even though Banooni had 3 ultrasounds over 3 years to look at, he treated me like a whiner when I sent him an ultrasound ordered by my Internist in Feb and complained of  pain 3 weeks out of the month of my cycle.  Banooni had no urgency to see me and put me off a month to even examine me!!!   I asked him politely to see me sooner since I was in pain and exhausted all the time.
He couldn't seem to understand why I was exhausted.  He put me off.

Then, a day before my appointment, he canceled.  He rescheduled for the following week, leaving me to languish further.  Then COVID hit.  My potential surgery to relieve me of my now worsening pain, got postponed indefinitely.  Meanwhile my belly had grown to the size of a 6 month pregnancy and my back was so painful I couldn't walk!  I wrote Dr. Banooni an email telling him, since he hadn't bothered to examine me still 6 weeks after getting the ultrasound.  He was seeing pregnant women.
But he decided I could wait.  Meanwhile, had he looked at my ultrasound from Feb, he would have known I couldn't or shouldn't.  So -all I got was an email back telling me there was nothing he could do and he billed my insurance $250.00 for a telehealth visit!  FOR AN EMAIL!

I mean if he had seen me on Facetime or Zoom, he would have actually seen my giant swollen belly.  My Internist was so alarmed,  he sent me to another OB/Gyn for a 2nd opinion.  This new Ob/gyn (who is just as well respected at Cedar's) saw me same day and scheduled me as emergent after getting an MRI within 48 hours.  I had surgery within a week. My uterus was covered with over 25 fibroids and was larger than a football!

It was causing digestive issues, leaning on my intestines, bladder and spine, causing sciatica and excruciating back pain.  My back is still sore 3 weeks later, and I will now need PT to deal with the repercussions of Dr. Banooni's negligence.  Incidentally, my new OB/GYN who knows Banooni well, and was shocked at his treatment, or lack thereof.  He called him negligent, and you know doctors are woe to disparage other doctors.

I cannot tell you how disappointed I am with Dr. Banooni, as is my Internist and new Ob/Gyn.  I was always polite to him,  and I gave him the benefit of the doubt after the IUD screw up.  I cannot tell you how sorry I am that I did.

Incidentally, if you are also Dr. Kornreich's patient and she is referring you.  Please do not hesitate to ask her for someone else if you're not getting the treatment you deserve.  I am certain she is quite concerned that her patients are well treated, and I can only believe she found this situation with me shocking.  I do not fault her in any way.  I cannot say the same about her colleague, Dr. Banooni.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Dr Banooni is a kind and caring doctor.

He's very pleasant and comforting. The atmosphere is positive and his exam is thorough. He cares about your life, as well as your body, and that's rare. I hope to be his patient for all the years to come.<//Text>< GmapID>

<text>After interviewing several doctors for a surgery I needed, we found Dr. Banooni.  We have been overjoyed with our experience. His bed side manner is kind, patient, knowledgeable and has always put me at ease. My husband loves him too. My experience first started with a surgery to remove a cyst and help alleviate major pains I was having throughout my monthly cycles. I was only a few months away from my wedding and really wanted to have enough recovery time as well. He found a way to push up the surgery date and did the surgery smoothly with no complications.  He also guided us gently through our first miscarriage and then through a successful pregnancy. When it came to delivering our son, he is the best! We had an uncomplicated delivery and it was wonderful to have him by our side, excited for us and smiling as we waited for our son's arrival. When it came time to push, he was a cheerleader and an ultimate professional. We are so thankful we found him and are looking forward to baby #2!<//text><resp>None<//resp>< UserId.>

Dr. Banooni delivered my son 10 years ago, and I will always go back to him for all my care. He is an incredible health professional, and human being. I have always appreciated his insight, support, and knowledge. He is a gift to the medical profession.</Review>

<review>I was referred to Banooni by my sister in law, he delivered all 3 of her girls. I remember our first appointment and him telling me and my fiancé we were having twins! We were trying to prepare to have our first baby never did we think we would be getting two at the same time!  Nonetheless my entire pregnancy Banooni made sure everything went smoothly including my delivery. I made it full term (38 weeks ) for twins and felt comfortable and safe the entire time. Anyone looking for a knowledgeable , professional and caring doctor should definitely go to him! He made my first pregnancy a breeze , we love you Banooni !< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80c2b95185af2b5f:0x2ee7a7923b14e24f</gmap_id></record>

<text>I interviewed many doctors when I was pregnant with my baby. Dr. Banooni came across as the most caring, authentic, knowledgeable and with a very good record of Natural births.  I am so lucky I chose him. He was amazing when my son was born. Absolutely listened to my concerns, my desires of wanting a natural birth without epidural etc. He was always calm and kind. Honestly can’t imagine a better first experience !!  He is the best !!<//text>< gmapID>

< Review>
Dr. Banooni has been my OBGYN for the last 14 years and he is wonderful.  His amazing demeanor and kindness helped me overcome a devistating second miscarriage before we had our two amazing boys in 2008 and 2011. He guided us expertly when our eldest needed an emergency C-Section and he was skilled and thoughtful about how to approach my care when I wanted to try a V-BAC 2 years later, and by stepping away allowing me the time for my body to do its work, he was able to successfully deliver our second son via V-BAC, even though I was a week overdue and our son was bigger than expected. He has continued his excellent standard of care all these years later, carefully checking on my health each year, as I have to be vigilant due to an unfortunate family history of breast cancer.  I would recommend him to anyone who has had difficult pregnancies, difficulties getting pregnant or difficulties during delivery.  He is careful, thoughtful and incredibly good at navigating all the issues that could come up.  And he's great even when routine care takes 5 minutes or less.  As I am moving into menopause he's been very informative and careful to help me navigate this transition, too.<//Review>

It’s rare to have a doctor as professional and caring as Dr. Banooni. My family is filled with deep gratitude for Dr. Banooni and his lovely staff. For the rest of my life I will be thankful to have had Dr. Banooni guide me through my pregnancy and deliver my beautiful baby. It’s a deeply personal experience and I wouldn’t have wanted anyone else to be a part of this momentous part of our lives.
Dr. Banooni is thorough, professional and warm. I always leave feeling like he genuinely cares about my well being. In my opinion he is one of the best doctors in the county.
Thank you Dr. Banooni!<//Review>

I am someone highly sceptical and suspicious of a lot of medical intervention but I can honestly say I have always felt comfortable and confident with the healthcare I am provided with him.

Since then, I am not only comfortable with a hospital birth and a csection, I look forward to it.

The email portal messages have gone unanswered. Critical prescription renewals, not responded to, office staff with attitude when you give up on the unanswered messages through the secure email portal... and incorrect dosage instructions on a prescription?  These are enough to sour any patient on a doctor and his office staff.  Forget the pretty pictures on the website! If a physician and his staff will not return calls and emails in a timely manner, will not service the refills they prescribe with accurate dosage and instructions, what good is the physician’s care?  There is no trust here now.  I am gravely disappointed.<//review>< Pics>

I had found out that I had a large Fibroid Tumor and the only option was surgery. Not only did he take 2 hours to discuss everything with me and explain our options but he's so caring and he was the only doctor that didn't just rush to the worst case Hysterectomy. He was understanding to my concerns and needs as well as my approach. He literally is worth every penny, every moment driving to see him and check up. I can't say more amazing things about him. Best surgery, best doctor in the state of California hands down. Blessed to have met him and have him to help me for life :)< /review>< date>

<text>It's not a good idea to choose your physician based on patient reviews; however,  in this case, you are in good hands.  Excellent physician.  Excellent care.  He's been my doctor for over 10 years, was my surgeon once,  and has always exceeded my expectations.< /text>< user>

<name>Courtney Messerli< /name><Text>I couldn't believe the number of positive reviews and was actually slightly skeptical (I'm a skeptic and super nervous at the doctor) and my expectations were met and exceeded. I had to get my second Nexplanon removed, and this experience was exponentially better than my first one. He was calm, patient, and confident which was necessary due to my nerves. Highly recommend!< /Text>< Resp>

Fantastic experience as a new patient today with Dr. Banooni! Despite having an incredibly busy practice, his attention to his patients is clearly a priority for him. I knew he was listening to every word I said and concern that I had, and applying his medical expertise diagnostically. I would highly recommend Dr. Banooni to any woman looking for a great OB/GYN, regardless of her age or current medical concerns. I’m 100% confident he will help my husband and I successfully have a second child. His office staff was similarly amazing, caring, and respectful, and scheduled me quickly realizing how anxious I was about my fertility. Thank you so much!</text>

Dr banooni is a wonderful OB. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for the most natural birthing experience possible. He was mindful of our wishes and understood we did not want interventional unless it was medically necessary. He never made us feel pressured, bullied, or judged. He has a calm,cool bedside manner that makes each visit enjoyable and really reassured me during the birth. This is my first baby so I had a lot of fear around the whole thing but Doctor Banooni made me feel heard, understood and respected every step of the way. Can't recommend him more!<//text>

Dr. Banooni and his staff have become like extended family. They have been part of such a journey in my life from surgery to a miscarriage to my first born son! Now onto my second pregnancy and I am so excited to get to see them more often. They always make me feel special and Dr. Banooni is incredibly knowledgeable, kind, warm, thorough, takes his time with my questions and made our delivery a warm, comfortable and special experience!  He's the best!!< /text>

Dr. Banooni delivered my son 3 years ago, and he has continued on as my primary OB. Always a professional, but warmth and kindness that is rarely found. My care during my pregnancy and in the years post has been outstanding, and I recommend his practice to anyone who asks!</text>

<Text>Dr. Banooni performed an abortion on my best friend’s daughter in May 2018.  She bled for weeks.  Dr. Banooni was not concerned.  Finally, in late June 2018, he suggested she return to his office since unusual things were coming out of her.  When he examined her, he said he did not abort everything!  He said he had to do it AGAIN!  They held her down!!!  No anesthesia!  Not even a Tylenol!  They held her down!  Painful and scary experience!  Dr. Banooni kept the $3,000 for a BOTCHED abortion!  Who knows if he damaged her uterus?!?  Only time will tell.  Shame on you, Dr. Banooni!!!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

I am a working expecting mom so I appreciate that Dr. Banooni can fit me in early before my work day starts.  He also has a very nice waiting room and the offices are very warm and hospitable.  The nursing staff is extremely nice and usually I can find an appointment within two weeks time.  A lot of the records are available through an online portal and Dr. Banooni is a very nice and kind doctor.  The down sides are: the wait times are long.  The record keeping is not great.  The parking is expensive.  I ended up switching doctors right before birth because a lot of hidden charges appeared on my billing for the birth.< /Text>

Dr Banooni has been my OB for over 13 years. His staff is incredible, as well. Some have been with him as long as I have been visiting that office, which says a lot about the office. Dr. Banooni is incredibly patient, knowledgeable, kind and an amazing doctor. He’s cared for me in my first pregnancy and now my second. My husband and I always leave that office feeling taken care of and never rushed. Top notch Doctor!</text>

With three complete and one still baking, we trust his care, his advice and his baby extraction process completely. He has a fantastic bedside manner and provides first class care. He keeps the atmosphere light (which I am grateful for, because what patient really wants to talk about a pregnant vagina), but is serious and respectful about questions, concerns and advice. Although I will never look forward to a yearly exam and its speculum goodness, I do look forward to a visit with Dr. Banooni. His assistant Julie and nurse Nora are also fantastic members of his team. I highly recommend him as a doctor for anyone considering becoming a patient.</text><Rating>5</Rating><time>1513205216175< /time>< user_id>

I began seeing him in 2013 to address issues with fibroids and Endometriosis. I had consulted with several other doctors about fibroid removal surgery (myomectomy) and they did not feel qualified for the procedure. Dr. Banooni took on my case with no problem and spent much time listening to my concerns as I wanted to make sure my fertility was preserved. In the hospital after surgery I developed a hematoma which led to another emergency surgery  and Dr.Banooni and the staff at Cedar's took excellent care of me through the entire process. Not to mention, my surgical incisions looked and healed amazing because of Dr. Banooni's surgical expertise and I have seen many other friend's with awful incision scars. Dr. Banooni is still my gynecologist (2018), and continually provides excellent care. At times appointments might be running behind and there is extra wait time, which can be frustrating, but it's because Dr. Banooni actually takes the time to listen and address all concerns in appointments and never gets annoyed, rushes you, or dismisses your thoughts. You might have to wait sometimes, but that time you waited comes back to you when you need it. I have never had any difficulties with scheduling appointments for both urgent. and non-urgent needs and Julie has always been great with helping and it's especially nice that she always remembers exactly who I am.<//Review>< Date>

Dr. Banooni is always a pleasure. He's patient, thorough, takes time to listen, and directly address all questions and concerns; exactly what you want/need from an OBGYN. Oh! And he has a sense of humor, so shooting the sh*t is always fun ;)</text>

Dr. Banooni delivered our baby girl last month. Through the entire pregnancy and birthing experience, I felt supported and well taken care of by Dr. Banooni and his team. He gave his medical advice and expertise as well as supporting my birthing wishes. It was a great experience and Dr. Banooni has the best bedside manners you can wish for in a doctor.</Text>

Dr. Banooni is the best and kindest doctor. He handled my ovarian cancer with such sympathy and professionalism. He gave me the diagnosis after he did the surgery. I couldn't have asked for a gentler, kinder, and detail oriented doctor and a very scary time in my life. I owe my life to doctor Banooni, and the Lord led me to him. I am very thankful to have had the BEST doctor available anywhere. Such a blessing!</Review>

I googled him right after and saw a bunch of glowing reviews and, with my amazing, healthy baby boy in my lap, I completely understand why. After my boyfriend & I experienced a miscarriage last summer with the least empathetic doctor I'd ever encountered, Dr. Banooni was so refreshing. He is calming, knowledgable, communicative, and incredibly caring. We were very anxious and he was always patient and answered our questions, no matter how silly they may have been. Once it came time to push, he was also an awesome support. Our family is moving out of state but I would genuinely consider moving back for our next pregnancy and I would easily recommend him to any friend.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Dr. Banooni is ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! I couldn't be more DELIGHTED to leave a testimonial and am honored to do so. I can tell you from the heart and from my experience as a longtime patient(of almost 9 years), that he is truly the BEST in the Beverly Hills/LA area and sets the standard and epitomizes what you'd look for in an OB/GYN.. Firstly, Dr. Banooni is a consummate professional with incredible expertise and talent.. What sets him apart from though from other doctor in this specialty is his COMPASSION-he is truly compassionate in every way: when you first meet him as a new patient you will feel at ease immediately due to his GENTLE, kind, warm, thoughtful manner. and his understanding.  He is incredibly understanding in every way-and he cares for me as a whole person-SO incredibly important- His compassion, gentleness, and understanding is evident in EVERY way he cares for you as a patient. You'll feel it the way he takes the time to fully and deeply hear and address each of your thoughts and concerns, and really every way in which he cares for you as a doctor! I have additional medical issues, having had three surgeries on my spine, and Dr. Banooni's wonderful care of all of the secondary issues that stem from that, and the way he works with my entire team of doctors-and always has is so amazing too...In addition, Dr. Banooni's STAFF are also incredible! They are very kind, thoughtful and compassionate to me. I feel that is VERY important. The office is located on the 2nd floor of a beautiful Medical Plaza, and  the waiting room is very serene, private and comfortable-the inner area where Dr. Banooni's office and the examination rooms are located is very comfortable as well. In so many words, Dr. Banooni is the epitome of what an Ob/Gyn should be in every single way, and I am always very happy to recommend him wholeheartedly!<//Text>< pics>

Dr. Banooni is the best!  I was told I could not have a vaginal hysterectomy due to the size of my fibroids ~ not an issue for Dr. Banooni, he changed the location on the scope placement and reduced my recovery to two weeks, instead of months.  He is personable and was willing to spend the time neccessary to answer all my questions.  I don't mind a little wait, when I know the doctor is late because he is taking time with his patients.< /Text>

Dr. Banooni is truthfully one of the best doctors I know. After seeing 6 doctors saying I needed a hysterectomy I went to Dr. Banooni and finally felt comfort in my final decision to not do the hysterectomy. I had a myomectomy in August 2017. It was all so scary and the moment I met him I felt comfort and knew it was all going to be ok because I was in the best possible hands. Not only is he a bad a** doctor but he is also an amazing person at heart. Got to know me, asked me a ton of questions and didn't just rush me out of the room. Spent the time with me to make me feel like I was making the best decision for me. Even put up with my calls after surgery lol I trust anything he says, my surgery was flawless, I have had no issues since and a year later tumor free. He is seriously the best and so thankful I was referred to him!<//review>

<Review>I love this man. Am I allowed to say this about somebody other than my husband?! :) Dr. Banooni is kind and patient, knowledgeable and insightful, truly a professional.

I was nervous leaving my previous female doctor (2+ years ago) from the same practice for a male doctor, but she assured me that I would have a great experience with him, and she couldn't be more right. This doctor is one of the most amazing I have ever encountered. He's mild-tempered, not an alarmist, but extremely thorough and I firsthand have seen him interact with other doctors for me on my behalf.

One baby later, I can truly say it's because he guided my husband and I every step of the way. And when it was time to have the baby and I needed an emergency c-section, he was with me every step of the way. AND when I freaked out just moments before the surgery, he held my hand and comforted me, and I knew at that moment it would be ok. And it was.

He also gives back to those who need his medical help, and if that's not telling about the type of person and doctor he is, what is?

I am forever indebted to Dr. Banooni for helping me deliver a healthy baby girl. I will continue to recommend him wholeheartedly to anybody. His staff is great too. I really can't say enough great things.< /Review>< Rating>

My favorite doctor since 2014 ...i wish I would of find him before because I had my first baby with another doctor and the experience wasn’t the same as with Doctor Banooni with me second baby  ! He is an incredible caring  doctor .
He always answers every question I have , i feel very confortable every  time i have an appointment I always get the best service from him and the people he works with .. I’m very thankful for him .< /Review>

<text>Dr. Banooni delivered our first son and has been my OB throughout the second half of my pregnancy (I transferred from out of state at week 20 and had a hard time finding a physician who would take me this late). My prenatal care was thorough and his bed-side manners are unparalleled. My husband and I had a great experience with him and his office staff (also L&D nurses at Cedars simply adore him which made our delivery team work seamlessly like a well oiled machine). We ricently moved to the Valley but I will keep Dr. Banooni as my OBGYN and am planning on having my second child delivered by him as well.</text>< pics>

Dr. Banooni is an excellent doctor, very attentive, understanding and patient. He's been my OB/GYN for over a decade now and I'd never go to anyone else. He answers all my questions, no matter how trivial I think they may be. As such OB/GYN visits can be very uncomfortable, but Dr. Banooni has a wonderful and friendly demeanor that makes all my visits comfortable. His staff is also courteous and friendly and most of the time the wait is not too long either. I recommend Dr. Banooni to anyone who wants excellent care and a trustworthy doctor.</Text>

<Review>I switched my OB to Dr. Banooni after it was found that my unborn baby has Spina Bifida (I'm located in Ventura County and was informed I needed to switch care to an OB who could deliver at UCLA, Cedars or somewhere close to Children's Hospital). Dr Banooni has been FANTASTIC in working with me and getting me in touch with all the specialists  that will likely need to care for my daughter  once she is born. This has been such a terrifying time for my husband and I and having a team of kind, caring  & informative doctors has been a major weight lifted.<//Review>< pics>

Dr. Banooni is the calmest and most gentle doctor. He delivered my two children and I continue to see him nine years later. His staff is wonderful and extremely helpful. If you are looking for a wonderful OBGYN you cannot go wrong with Dr. Banooni!<//review>

I had a challenging time finding an OBGYN when I moved to LA (one had me giving a sample in key-entry bathroom outside and away from her office. It was not clean.  Not all Beverly Hills practices are the same, that's for sure...) but when I stopped googling and just called Cedars for a rec they sent me to Dr. Banooni.  He's he first doctor to take the severity of my cramps seriously, he came in on a Sunday morning after his kid's soccer game to do a procedure - he really is the greatest.<//Text>

If you are looking for an OBGYN look no further. Dr. Banooni is the kindest doctor and really Listens to you. I had the most beautiful birth thanks to him since he knew I wanted to have my baby without epidural. Though that wouldn’t have been his preferred method he respected my choice and it was honestly the happiest day of my life (yes painful :) but magical none the less) I have been going with dr. Banooni for about 11 years now. Couldn’t have a better doctor. Believe me you will feel the same way.</text>

< Review>
I'm sure there are lots of good Doctors out there, but Dr. Banooni is an EXCELLENT Dr.  I've been seen by Dr Banooni since 2010  and couldn't be more pleased with his care.  Even though I felt hesitant to see a male Dr. back then my point of view changed when I first met him.  His knowledge, kindness, and warm smile makes you feel you are going to be in good hands.  He really listens to your concerns and he makes you feel at ease ( even if you are a nervous wreck) I'm just sorry I didn't find him 10 yrs ago when I first wanted to start a family.. I wasted four precious yrs with a "female" Dr.  however; with the help of Dr. Banooni I now have my precious son and I'm ever greatful  for Dr. Banooni😊.< /Review>

<date>1470804772442< /date><rate>1</rate><Text>I had been going to Dr. Banooni for a few years. Just your standard once a year check up. Never had any issues, he took my insurance, (and I always asked for my labs to go to an in network lab because I have that right!)  for the most part ran on time, is next door to my internist... Until a few months ago. I was there December for my regular check up. No news is good news right?! WRONG!!!! In April at 8 pm I get a call from the dr. He was auditing his charts and some how my abnormal results were lost and I needed to come back in ASAP. I was in so much shock I said I would call back in the am to make an apt. I was a wreck. I have had a few breast cancer scares so I couldn't stop crying and did not sleep that night. I called the next morning and the nurse knew who I was and said come in ASAP. I came in that afternoon with my mom. I had a number of test and asked if I would be charged. The dr said no. But I let the dr know I was actually upset because 3 days prior Cedars called me and said I had an outstanding bill with them. I had no idea what it was. I have no outstanding bills with anyone! It was from my labs for Dr Banooni in December! $208?!!! How?!?! He sent my labs to an out of network Dr. 😡 Dr. Banooni was so embarrassed and knew he was liable for losing my labs he said "I'll take care of this bill to make it right. Plus the Jewish guilt is killing me." Guess what?! He refused to take care of it. I called once a week. The receptionist (who acted like she was afraid of the dr) refused to let me talk to the dr or he just ignored me in hopes I would go away. I offered to come in, to drive from Irvine where I live just to solve this. Nope. I was told do not come in. Long story short after months of calling to dr make it right, I was sent to collections. Awesome! So in the end I guess he won. I paid the bill and he got rid of me. Absolutely DISGUSTING. So if you want a good OBGYN, go to Dr Scott Serden at Cedars. He takes insurance and respects you.</Text>< pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>(Translated by Google) I found Dr. Banooni by chance and would not trade him for anything. He is super patient and very professional.
This year I had several complications with some cysts and we were finally able to solve it.
I recommend it 100%.
