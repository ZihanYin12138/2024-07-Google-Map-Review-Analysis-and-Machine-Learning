Every time I go in to West Point Medical Center Urgent
Care I am always well taken care of. The staff is very
welcoming and helpful from the front desk to the back
office staff. At my most recent visit, Ms. Marie took very
great care of me. She was very knowledge and
informative with every question I had for her. She was
very professional and made my visit pleasant and quick.

Thanks Marie.

GREAT STAFF! 😊< /Text>

I needed to see a Dr. due to swelling in my left lower jaw. I have a couple of bad teeth that need to be pulled. I got there at 10am, was seen by the doc, and was walking to the car at 10:40. Everybody was really nice and helpful...the girl in the front office, the medical assistant AND the doc. I will definitely recommend this Urgent Care to friends and family.<//text>

I love coming here for my diet plan. Maria and Crystal are so warming and nice. Maria gives good advice and is always willing to help. Crystal has a wonderful heart and gentle hands when giving me my weight loss program injections. Today is November 21, 2019 and I was seen by Carla and Jackie. They are very attentive and informative. When I receive my weight loss shots as well they both have a very steady and light hand. I truly recommend this place.</review>

I come here for my weight loss. And I don’t have a complaint ever. Marie was my receptionist, so professional and the best she told me the days of specials for the B6’s and checked me in quick. I wasn’t even waiting longer than 7 minutes. Then when the nurse in the back called me her name is crystal so polite as well. She also had information for me about the program. Made me feel comfortable. Thank you ladies again. Def coming back!</review>

<text>DO NOT DO THE WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO WAIT 1-2 HOURS EACH WEEK.

Upon getting my insurance to cover the 9week program I was told the appointments were quick to gets the shots and vitamins.  It is February I got approval in October and have not been able to participate in the program on a consistent basis because EACH TIME I've come in the wait has been over an hour.

And they can't blame flu season because it was way before flu season that I started the program. Sometimes the staff is friendly sometimes they have an attitude.<//text>< UserId.>

I took my husband in for extreme stomach pain. The office was not busy and it was early, but it still took quite awhile for him to be seen. The nurse weighed him and took him temperature, and that was it. The doctor spent all of 2 minutes with him, did NO physical exam at all, and then said its basically heartburn and prescribed prescriptions strength prilosec. My husband was in agony, so I took him immediately to the er from ungent care, where he has been diagnosed with kidney stones. I'm highly disappointed in the lack of care he received at West Point Urgent Care. I do not recommend for anyone to waste your time going here.<//review>

I have always enjoyed my visits going to the weight loss program that is held here. To give you a time scale i've been going for more than 10 weeks. But yesterday has put more things into perspective. My daughter and I would always get treated with the best care. But yesterday when I brought my son in, it was a different story. My son recently started working out so I thought it would be a good idea to bring him along. We all paid to get shots and my son filled out forms to start the program. My son and daughter got their names called and  asked me to  entered the room as well. For many reasons of course but the main two were that my son wanted me to go back there, and he didn't know what to do so i could give him advice about where to get the shots etc. When we went to the exam room and my son sat down to get his vitals etc taken care of. But Yadi S. the M.A that was seeing us was not doing everything correctly. I know because i'm in the medical field myself. She told my son that his blood pressure was perfect for a 21 year old. But it was 127/80. That is abnormal and I told her that it wasn't normal at all. But she kept saying it was. Giving any patient the wrong information can be life and death. Especially if its not handled right away.  So my son didn't know his height, Yadi the M.A told him that it didn't matter. Mind you within the weight loss program you get shots and pills so you have to make sure everything is correct.  I explained to Yadi that stadiometer is right there on the wall. Yadi then talked under her mouth and kept on with her attitude. So then she was then having an attitude and said we can walk over to measure his height. He is 6 ft 2 inches. She didn't wanna raise the bar to get his height. So my son was slumped over trying to lift it. So instead I then proceeded to do it myself. Of course i'm getting a little annoyed because if shes not doing this 100% correct then what else is she doing? We then finally get into the room. A couple  of minutes go by and Yadi walks in. She first tells my son the wrong amount of shots that he would be getting. Then once again I had to correct her and say the right amount. She proceeds to give my daughter and I the shots. When she was giving us the shots she kept mentioning to rub it in. Using a angry tone in her voice. So fast forwarding my son had to get an EKG, which scans your heart. She kept taking him to a different room away from me just because she  didn't want me to hear the information that she was giving my son. I finally asked her "Why are you taking my son to a separate room?" She then told me that she has to keep redoing the test because it keeps telling her that his heart isn't getting enough oxygen. Which I kept telling her earlier that his blood pressure was abnormal but she kept fighting me on it saying that it was totally normal.  I even googled a blood pressure chart for adults to show Yadi that the systolic mm (upper number) between the rang of 120-129 and the Diastolic mm (lower number) is consider to be in the elevated range. I explain to Yadi that diagnosing someone without the proper information , can affect someone's life. Yadi started to yell and explain that she was "right", causing a scene. So because of the bad information that she kept fighting me on earlier it turns out that I was 1 right and the doctor confirmed that his blood pressure was to high. 2 The test from the EKG showed that his heart was not getting enough oxygen and needed to be rushed to the hospital. The doctor told me that my son was on the verge of either having a heart attack. Which then I had to rush into mom mode and take care of my son which I did. I got his blood pressure down and my son is going to be okay. But because Yadi  was giving him wrong information and having an attitude. I can only think if i wasn't there Yadi would have my son believing he was fine. We wouldn't have known that my son needed medical attention. Yadi still at this point was still having an attitude, When I asked for her name.She refused 20* before the doctor told her to give me her name.< /Text>

We would like to respond to some of the points you made in your review. First let me start by saying all our staff is trained and highly motivated to deliver the best care possible to every one of our patients. I know you mention you are in the Healthcare field which is great but you are not trained in our medical weight loss program. You mentioned your sons blood pressure was not normal specifically the systolic number, or bottom number.  Normal blood pressure is considered to be anything below 120/80. Hypertension is defined as blood pressure of 130/80 or higher.  Your son's blood pressure was in range. One of the things we do on your first visit is an Electrocardiogram or EKG which could indicate a problem or issue with your heart. We do this for several reasons but the biggest being the medication we dispense can elevate your heart rate and is not suitable for everyone. This should be done always before dispensing this medication for the first time. We would not be doing our job as Medical Professionals if we failed to do every step. If this is abnormal the provider may refer you back to your Primary for a cardiac consult to be cleared to take the medication or in some cases refer to the Emergency Room. This is not done unless the provider feels it is a necessary step. As for our staff everyone is required to wear a name badge when on the floor working so names are easily accessible to all. We are sorry you feel like your son had a bad experience but we feel he got the service he deserved and needed at the time he was seen. We hope to continue to see you and your family in our weight loss program and hope your son is feeling better. Have a wonderful day."}</Resp>< date>

<Text>Great service. The environment is great from you walking in with Francia as a receptionist and Desiree is a great nurse and Dr.shaty was great as well he took time to listen what was wrong with me.  I actually heard of this place from my son. The girls asked me to comment if I think they did good, so that’s the least I can do. Keep up the good work!< /Text>< pics>

<Time>1545190232824</Time><Rating>1</Rating><text>The worse ever. At first they were friendly and there was no one in the lobby. Waited about an hour (expected), physician was nice and competent enough. We were told they would call in our prescriptions to the pharmacy. Waited at the pharmacy for over an hour and half, prescription never came in, called daisy 4 times and each time she said she would call it in. Finally went back to get the actual prescription. Very unprofessional and kept lying to her supervisor about calling it in the first time. Extremely sick and had to wait 3 hours to get meds. Will never go back.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

This was my first time going into an Urgent care and i was very satisfied with my experience there. As soon as I walked in Francia was greetful. 10 minutes later I was already called back by the nurse Desiree she was so good and fast at what she does but yet didn’t make me feel rushed. She let me know how many people were in front of me if any and answered all my questions. Overall great experience. Coming back for sure</Text>

< Review>
Cannot fault the care I received here this morning. I am a tourist visiting California from the UK and unfortunately woke up this morning with an ear infection so needed to find a doctor. I choose this place and I'm so glad I did.
The man on reception was so sympathetic and told me what I needed to do and did everything he could to help me out with my travel insurance etc. The nurse was lovely when she came to examine me and as was the doctor. He prescribed me medication to ease the pain and clear up the infection.
All in all I think I was in there for about an hour in total. Brilliant care service. Thank you.</Review>

This place used to be nice but the receptionist does not want to be here and even though I watched her check us in on paper, and seen us sitting there for an hour, she acted as if she never seen us. 3 people went ahead of us because she forgot to check us in on the computer. I understand that there is an urgency priority so I didn't care if a broken finger went ahead of a sick little girl, but when a similar case went ahead, I had to say something. They called us back right away but even in the room there was another long wait. I never had this problem here before. Never waited more than an hour for the whole appointment.< /review>

<Text>My son and are we're sick and needed care, the urgent care down the street from my house was horrible awful terrible. I went and looked up another urgent care and West Point medical center popped up I read the reviews and thought why not. When I arrived the nurse that had me sign in she was ok but a little snappy and sharp, the nurse that took me and my son vitals was AMAZING she engaged in conversation made us feel very comfortable and she was patient. When the doctor came in doctor bells I believe he was cool, wasn't pushy checked my son out and was gentle he answered all my questions and was patient as well he was a good man and doctor. Overall my favorite thing about West Point was that we weren't in the for hours on end, from the time we checked in to the time we left it was only an hour maybe less. They are quick and very helpful 5 stars</Text></record></dataset><record>

I always go to West Point Medical Center San Bernardino. The place is clean and the receptionist Francia is very nice with everyone, the staff Desiree and Jenny are wonderful. Also one of the nurse Jasmine is very companionate and kind. The doctor that works there, Doctor J Watkins & K Genco are amazing in what they do. Thanks to the Company that has staff members so dedicated to help us!
They really deserve y great review since I have been there many many time and I always get the same response. Thank you so much keep up the great work!!!!</Text>

Finally when called back i was placed in a room where Rafael assisted me and made me feel comfortable. He apologized for the wait and treated me with the best care i ever received. While waiting for the doctor, he came and checked up on me and brought us water with some stickers for my daughter (which made her stop crying), finally when Doctor came in, (despite the facility being closed) the doctor answered all my question and took the time to hear my concerns. The only thing i can complain about is the wait time and the time it took to give me a doctors note, but didn't mind because i saw that he was the only one there. I will defiantly come back if i have to! Thank you West Point, Rafael and Dr ( I don't remember her name)</text>< userid>

My family moved here from Washington a year ago and we have been to several hospitals/doctors over the last several months for different reasons and have always left unsatisfied.  My boyfriend had a motorcycle crash and had severe road rash in which the hospital he went to didn't even treat him so after being let down so many times my hopes of being treated right were not very high.

We walked into West Point Medical Center 3 days after his crash to have them look at his wounds and re-wrap them since his own doctor's office wouldn't answer the phone.  We were very satisfied with West Point Medical to say the least.  Intake process with Rafael was painless and didn't take too long considering it was an urgent care clinic.

When we were finally seen, we weren't left in a room for hours.  Given that it was Raj's last shift before leaving town for a while, you'd think he'd be in a hurry, but he took the time to carefully look at the wounds and redress and offered for us to come back to redress the wounds if we needed.  Bridget and the ex-tern JB were also very helpful and we definitely didn't even feel like we were in a urgent care clinic.  All were very friendly and made this visit very painless and definitely will be back if we ever have to ,hopefully not though...no more accidents!

Thank you West Point Medical Center!!</text>

i dont usually write a reveiw unless im really impressed or disappointed.. my visit here has been the one of my best urgent care visits yet. I came here for the first time. everyone at the front desk was kind, friendly and fast. The young indian girl in the back seemed very genuine and sweet. She looked like she knew what she was doing and and really cared for me and my kids. She made us feel comfortable and we felt like we had known her forever. She was patient and kept checking on my son to make sure he was doing better. The Doctor was also very kind and knowledgable. He made diagrams and showed us exactly what was wrong which i thought was very sweet. He ws patient and kind... Thank you. I know where to come when anyone in my family gets sick.</text>

<Review>ive been going to this urgent care for about a month now and i will im so impressed. Suhani our nurse makes us feel very welcomed and comfortable. Shes funny and very gentle with procedures and cares. She always makes sure everything is ok and would go ask doctors, She is my husbands and mine absolute favorite! last time i went she said she wont be working here alot anymore and made me really sad. She has really left an impression on me. I wish her nothing but the best blessings. Really hope to see her soon!</Review>< Pictures>

CAUTION!!! IF IT GAVE ME A CHANCE TO VOTE 0 STARS I WOULD. I CAME HERE TO URGENT CARE FOR  URGENT TREATMENT, MY DAUGHTER HAD A FEVER OF 103. THE DR CAME IN LOOKED AT HER AND NOT EVEN LESS THAN 3 MINUTES SHE SAID SHE HAD A EAR INFECTION. I WAS LIKE GREAT AWESOME SHE PRESCRIBED AMOXICILLIN. GAVE IT TO HER. 1 DAY LATER MY DAUGHTER IS COVERED IN RED RASHES ALL OVER HER BODY. WENT TO SEE HER DOCTOR TO GET HIS OUTTAKE AND HE SAID SHE NEVER HAD A EAR INFECTION HE DON'T KNOW HOW SHE CAME UP WITH THAT CONCLUSION.  SO HAPPENS MY DAUGHTER IS ALLERGIC TO AMOXICILLIN AND SHE COULD OF DIED BECAUSE THIS NURSE ASSUMED SHE HAD A EAR INFECTION!!! WORST URGENT CARE EVER!!!! MIGHT I REMIND YOU MY DAUGHTER IS 9 MONTHS OLD. BEWARE.<//Review>

I have been going to West Point medical Center For many Months now . Pertaining to different things. During one of our First vists I meet a wonderful nurse named  Suhani Randev. She was hands down the most gentle down to earth person  I have ever met working there. My daughter had smashed her finger pretty bad and It needed to be looked over washed cleaned and dressed . Keep in mind my daughter is 4yrd old  so you can imagine the struggle of keeping her clam quiet and relaxed my daughter had been in tears from screaming and crying. I thought about taking her to the emergency room and instead I took her here to West Point where I meet the miracle Worker I call her Shuhani Randev . She was AMAZING with her within Seconds of her walking in she got my daughter to stop crying and got her to start giggling. She was then able to look at what was wrong with her dress and clean the wound all in minutes. She was very passionate about her work and very caring to all of my kids. I have three baby's and including me all in the back room this woman made me feel at home and welcome she asked questions not demanded them and she took her time to hear my concerns . My kids love this woman so much and that was from the first time meeting her.
I have never never never ever meet someone so Amazing with children. Like I said before I have been going here for months now and it is all because of this woman. I have gone to many other places and none of them have givin me the treatment this woman provides thank you so much Shuhani Randev
I hope West Point gives her the recognition she deserves. I have never seen her provide poorly she has keep and maintained the high services she gave to me and my family the very first time we meet her.< /Review>

The wait was ridiculous. I got here at 1pm im getting out at 4pm. Its not packed at all. I watched 3 people get called ahead of me that came in after me. They brought me back for vitals then put me back in the waiting room. They said they were full and couldn't fit me. I tried to notify the doctor as to why I was here and what's going on with me once he took me to a room. He said he doesn't want to hear what I have to say and will be back after he puts my info into the computer...i haven't even given him any info to put in the computer...then he comes back and when i tell him whats going on he says i dont know what i need (even though ive dealt with these symptoms for 35 years and know what works and doesent on my body) they prescribed me the medicine that i said doesn't work on my body...this place is a joke!< /text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>I came in with  excruciating  cheek pain. I was turned away because I had Kaiser insurance. Obviously the woman behind the counter didn’t know how to do her job. It’s urgent care, you send the bill to the patients primary facility but I guess she has lack of training.  When I asked her what urgent care facility does accept Kaiser she said “Kaiser..” that makes no sense...so I left still in pain and very upset<//Review><GmapID>0x80c35256fbb62abd:0x6dca75704c0f9a8<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>First off, the doctor thinks hes he can just walk in and diagnosis you right away without further testing. Second, the lady at the front desk is a total bigot. I asked to change pharmacies and she pretended to do it so i didnt even bother getting my prescription or going back because these people are just a waste of time.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><user_id>100677162422592005722<//user_id><username>Dee</username>< Rate>

<Text>(Translated by Google) More than a year ago I was there maybe it was not the right place for my daughter, I didn't have much living in this area but my baby was bad, she was about a year old or so and she had vomit and was almost faint A woman who was at the window only cared about the doctor's card and said she could not attend to my daughter there I left with great helplessness crying to see my baby badly without knowing what to do and I really do not wish that on anyone ... yes I could give 0 stars I would give them

My son has been taking classes here for over a year. It is probably one of the few places that actually teaches kids solid / rigorous knowledge. It is not one of those play-based after school programs. If your kids want to participate in competitive math/physics/coding, this is the place to go. As a Bay Area resident, I feel that we are lucky to have such a place to provide the trainings needed to get our kids to the next level.<//text>

My daughter started to take summer camp class since last summer and she enjoyed it so much and continue with regular class. The teachers are experienced, humorous and inspiring. The staffs respond very fast. Later I find out that almost all top students in math competitions take classes here. We will definitely keep going to Alphastar and will recommend it to others with kids who love math.< /Text>

<review>My son started to take math class at AlphaStar when he was in elementary school. Even since, he has never stopped taking math and computer science classed there for a few years now. He enjoys the classes so much that he wouldn't even want to try any other places. He also goes there for summer camps every year. In addition to improving his problem-solving skill and going to math competitions, he has also made many new friends. Dr. Ali has been very responsive and helpful in answering parents questions and providing suggestion and advices. We highly recommend AlphaStar!< /review><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

His teachers are experienced, approachable, and resourceful in guiding him.

Ever since he started going to AlphaStar, he has become more motivated in competition. It is really fun for him to meet and work with others there who are driven and want to propel themselves in math, science, and computer programming. Math is a social endeavor; AlphaStar makes learning engaging for its students, and my son particularly enjoys traveling with his teachers and fellow students for team competitions.< /Review>< Pictures>

Aside from what the other reviews said about quality classes and instructors, AlphaStar is also very engaged with the concerns and demands of the community. For instance, AlphaStar hosts its own contests in the summer and also sends teams to math and computer science contests around the country, allowing students to gain valuable experieces. AlphaStar also has extensive feedback between students and instructors, and works every year to update and revamp curriculum for more effective teaching, so I have no doubt that this will continue to be a great learning environment for years to come.< /text><date>1544332411111</date>< Response>

AlphaStar is a wonderful place to learn math, computer science, and physics. With numerous courses at levels ranging from introductory to advanced Olympiad material, their yearlong classes and summer/winter camps are perfect opportunities to get into competitions or get ahead. The instructors all motivate the students to work better and be more excited about learning and doing the problems. I am glad that AlphaStar is there to support the enthusiastic members of the math/CS community.< /review>

For the past two years, we’ve been taking our son to AlphaStar math programs, commuting more than 50 miles each way, because he enjoys the classes very much.  Dr. Ali and other instructors are all very friendly and supportive, making learning fun and stimulating. In addition to improving his problem-solving skill and going to math competitions, he has also made many new friends. Thanks to AlphaStar!!< /review>

<text>Both my son and daughter have been participating in AlphaStar Academy since their elementary schools. They learned both math and computer science there. The teachers in both math class and CS class are very professional. They teach each student very patiently, and make sure they know and understand the content of classes. They also treat students like a family. They organize year-end family dinner for all students and families.  The Math Director also organized new year party and dinner for math teams. So student there not only get good education of STEM classes but also get a sense of family and community. We are very proud of being part of it.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Text>I am in the summer computer science camp, which is totally not as advertised. The strictness that I am seeing is overboard. Because they take points off aggressively for small mistakes and discourage adding your own improvements to your code, room for creativity in this camp is basically zero. And their strictness makes this camp feel like a computer science boot camp, not the advertised "fun educational summer camp." I really wish changes would be made to make mine and others' experience more enjoyable and worth the price.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<review>I've worn many hats at AlphaStar Academy, including but not limited to being a student, math competition team member, and teaching assistant.  Like many of the other reviewers, I could talk about how much math I learned through AlphaStar's A* curriculum, but what was most valuable to me was the intellectual community of STEM-lovers I was exposed to at AlphaStar, many of whom have become my closest friends.  The instructors and students all share an unrelenting passion for math and other fields of STEM, but, more importantly, they are all motivated, diligent, humble, and kind people.  The Gauss Master Classes formed some of my best memories from high school.  Thank you AlphaStar for welcoming me into such an intellectually stimulating *and* nurturing community — I highly recommend AlphaStar to anyone with an interest in STEM!!<//review>< Pics>

<text>Alphastar is not just a good place to learn, it's a great place! In my opinion, it's one of the premier places for math and computer science and it shows in their cred and their stats. They always bring the best teams to various competitions and are so inclusive and helpful. I highly recommend alphastar to anyone who either is enthusiastic and wished to learn more, or who wants to be part of of that competition experience!

The quality of the classes here are such that people from all over the Bay Area take classes here and not only improve in both competitive math/CS/physics, but also meet each other (and I personally have made many friends at AlphaStar).

AlphaStar Academy introduced me to computer science through their USACO program, and ever since I haven't looked back. Under Dr. Gelgi's direction, I've learned more about C++ and programming than I ever would have through any other alternatives. The program has been developed over many years and is perfect for students who want a challenging yet enjoyable learning experience. The math program is also equally reputable, and I would highly recommend both for any student looking for the next step in their competitive journey.</Review>

<review>This summer camp gave me one of the worst summers i have ever experienced. This camp is overpriced and the rooms here are so bad. There were cracks all over the ceiling and a huge hole.

Alphastar does an excellent job preparing students for math expertise. My son did advanced aime and gauss classes, and had a fun time learning and participating in competitions. It is the go to place for high school and contest math in the bay area. Highly recommended.<//Text>

<text>Both my sons went to Alphar Star math/CS camps in the past, and they enjoyed it very much. The classes are well organized and a lot of fun. My sons told me how much they learned and kept asking to coming back to the Alphar Star summer camp without looking for anywhere else. It is definitely the top place to consider if you have a young age STEM student looking for trainings beyond regular school work.<//text><rating>5< /rating><resp>None</resp>< pictures>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>I am so glad that i stumbled into Alphastar when I was looking for a math camp for my older son couple of summers ago. Since then,  both my sons regularly take lessons and camps throughout the year.
The curriculum is wonderful. It really challenges the kids and inculcates valuable problem solving skills early on. All the teachers in Alphastar are subject experts.  They are nice people striving to bring out the best in the kid. Its amazing how the teachers can make all these analytical subjects super fun that the kids really look forward to their lessons.
In short, here is my -  Three Cheers for Alphastar. Hip, Hip, Hurray!!<//text>< pics>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>My son had a wonderful learning experience from AlphaStar Academy. He  loves USACO,  he realized that just self-studying wasn’t going to be enough so he looked for resources and found AlphaStar Academy. He had phenomenal experiences at AlphaStar and soaked in as much as humanly possible. So he finished 8th in the US on the December 2017 USACO contest and 6th in the January 2018 USACO contest, became a 2018 USACO finalist. AlphaStar teachers are excellent! I really appreciate Fatih Gelgi, he always try his best to inspirits, helps and supports his students!< /review><rate>5<//rate>< date>

I go here for the birria hands down the best around if you like spicy ask for the special sauce they have in back. If your a weenie dont try it it might be too intense for some. Hand made tortillas and great service over all love going here.</text>

restaurant is consistently good. It is a 5 mile drive for us and worth every foot. We ate there this morning. I had huevos  rancheros. They were outstandingly flavorful. If you like authentic Mexican cuisine, this is the place.

Parking can be problematic. This morning we had to walk two and a half blocks. Still worth it though.< /text>

<Review>Best sopitos in town (besides my momma's)!!! Made estilo Michoacan. Menudo is on point! With or without Pata.  Tortillas hechas a mano.  No AC, but the food is soooo worth it. Beer and Micheladas available.

<Response>None</Response><Review>A perfect bit of Mexico.  Fresh tortillas on demand are the bomb.  The chilaquiles verdes are my breakfast favorite.  I don't know what Ryan Ausanka-Crues (of course look at his photo) was sayin' about the beans... they're beans... simple and very good, and the fresh tortillas are the real deal.  Wait staff always smiling is a plus.</Review>< Pictures>

Birria at 7:48 on a Tuesday morning? Menudo with fresh tortillas and lots of onions? Taquería González has you covered. I come for the tortillas, usually made while I order, and one of the stews. On each table is a service container holding onions and bright cilantro, a molcajete full of oregano and dried chilies, then another with lime slices, three kinds of salsa in squeeze bottles, and a bucket of rich, oily, nutty mole. This morning, the tortillas, were too hot for me to touch when they arrived at the table. The birria de chivo is sound but not complex. With lime and onions and chilies to taste, you have a delicious filling for a fresh tortilla. There was a re-run of Mexico playing Panamá on the T.V. today, but no one was really watching; everyone was too interested in their food.< /text>

One of the worst bean and cheese burritos on middlefield. Not very much flavor, watery beans, boring salsas, and uninteresting tortilla. Our food came out several minutes apart as well.</Review>

< Review>
DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!! This was my first time going to this place, I got a gel pedicure and acrylic full set, the pedicure was fine but when I got my acrylics done that’s when everything went wrong. She did not pay attention to me at all. she cut my skin numerous times  because she was paying attention to her coworker while she was filing my nails. The coworker was getting water all over the floor because she doesn’t know how to properly use equipment. I explained to her how I wanted the color on my nails and she didn’t listen to me. I told her twice that what she was doing was wrong and she still didn’t listen or do it as I requested. Not to mention they over charged us by at least 20 dollars compared to what was on their pricing signs. At that point I was just done and wanted to escape this place.</Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Luan is incredible! I got gel French Tips and they are absolutely perfect. 10/10 would recommend this nail salon! $35 and about 25 minutes. I’ve been to 40 of the 50 states in the USA. She never cut me or messed up like so many of the other places out there!This place is actually SOO good. The location in the city is not for weak willed women but my ladies who are tough, this place is for you. Unfortunately didn’t have time to get my toes done today so I bought a polish. The polishes are extremely reasonable. Luan was so nice 👍🏼<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMt1f3NpDYE-y7ollx--PI6NWRls6kE7jAG36Vv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzJBDEdByBtTOCE6lktTnHUd2cR3kYO7sPAb6j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdZefRlJLAV8nTYsozzLCjQNaca7saIUxZPd5y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjysLiUt6t5-MrCo5W7SDxhf0GLdeQhBynkwoL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnYJNwgTMzeoXhVo1Bf5mGfHiKv77AZZJOAzua=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcKl4-IjayYYCxa0wC12kXVLvdKynUQ98cqHhg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

This place is the worst nail place I have ever been to, they rush to do your nails and on top of that do not tell you from the beginning that they do not take cards and makes you go run around to get cash. Over a hundred dollars for a manicure that looks like a 7 year old could have done it. Beware of this place.< /Text>

<user_id>101789914990237791413</user_id><review>I loved this place! I went there with 2 friends for pedicures- we were easily able to call and make an appointment for the next day, and they were ready when we arrived a few minutes early. They made sure the three of us were sitting together. The place was cute, clean, and spacious, the ladies who did our nails were wonderful, friendly, and talented! The prices are reasonable. I would definitely recommend Excellent Nails!< /review></record></dataset><record>

Lu Ann is my go to girl! She is absolutely amazing at what she does. I left the area a few years ago and just recently returned - she actually remembered me and it's like I never left! I highly recommend her!<//Review>

Took my girlfriend here to get her nails done before her graduation. Beautiful little spot and super friendly environment! It was pretty clean and great pricing! My girlfriend loved her nails so I would definitely come back again!< /Text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Review>Not so excellent. My one and only time here. Been hesitant to try this place but caved due to price and location. They don't use liners, and I was out on the lady when I selected #2 and she rudely said "no, do #"3".  After I declined she just became more rude and bizarre. I have them a 2 because despite the dirty floor, walls, and shelves on top of the stacks and stacks of tabloid magazines, my pedicure turned out decent, not great but decent.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I came into this salon to get a pedicure right before another shut down. The lady didnt change her gloves before starting with me, I asked her too and she did with attitude. Then she started to use a used nail file on me and I asked her to change that as well and she said it was new. She then went and cleaned out another tub while still on my feet and didnt want to change her gloves again. They told me not to come back, that I complain to much and they wouldnt give me my money back  and I told them its Covid and i was scared. This isnt right<//Review><Resp>None<//Resp><Name>Rhiab Hamdi<//Name><date>1595027008388< /date><rate>1</rate>< pics>

Everyone is very nice, my nail tech did an awesome job. I drive trucks so it's hard to find good places to go, if I'm in town the next time when I need them done I will come back here. I brought my own design and I'm very pleased.<//Review>

<Text>I’m definitely disappointed. It was not what I asked for and it was way over priced ! I wanted acrylic nails and she did powder and I was not even told it would cost extra than an acrylic I will not be going back because she did not listen to what I wanted and kept suggesting things to my friend an I. She was a nice person and all but if a customer asks for specifics then do it or don’t do it at all. I’m very sad. I paid $58! I’ve never paid that much for “powder nails” not to mention I left a tip. I am very sad.. came on Veterans Day as well and called ahead of time an hour prior to closing. If I knew she was going to rush and not do as told I would have never came. No wonder this place has a 3 star..< /Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Don’t waste your time and money in this place. I came on Thursday to make me some manicure with gel on my nails, but on Saturday they were peeling off.🤦🏻‍♀️. They gave me a guarantee that they weren’t peeling off, so when I came back to get them fixed, they only told me that I could only get a discount. My question is, why a discount if they should’ve fixed them completely? Very bad material<//Review>

<gmap_id>0x80dc71582f8782d3:0x4c8fd60411cdccc8<//gmap_id><text>If I could give no stars I would!!! Normally I don't do reviews but I have to try and save someone from the horrible service they have here. I got a full set on new years eve by Luann and then someone else finished them. Don't even know her name because she acted like she didn't want to talk.

My acrylic application done by Luann was sloppy, lumpy and in contact with my cuticles.  I asked her to smooth it out but she refused, saying they "look fine" then I tried one more time before gel application step to get her to smooth out the acrylic and she refused once again. I asked her if she could just remove the nails and then she said I would still get charged full price $45 even if she took them off.  So I let the next woman paint the nails paid, and left..begrudgingly. The next day, tiny specks and bubbles appeared on the surface of my nails.

I managed to pick the glue and acrylic away that was in contact with my cuticles, but now I've got to find a new shop. This is the closest shop to my home and I will never return.<//text>< Rate>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>( worst acrylic nails  ever done)Came back I came here once b4 6years ago . Anyway she over charged me didn't even use powder or white tips just painted everything on and they are super thick and chunky exactly what I did not want . I explained to her what I wanted so she clearly new . Lulu is lazy and bad at nails . I went somewhere else and the fixed them for 15$ and they look amazing. She needs to find another occupation because a nail tech is not one of them . Horrible nails, horrible place, over priced , scammers.!<//text>< Pictures>

I appreciated all the tech's kindness.
I do, however, have a slight problem with how forceful the up selling is! I simply wanted a manicure (no prices listed) and felt pressured to have an oil treatment costing $20. I did choose that service and my hands feel AMAZING; except it sort of felt forced upon me!</text>

I stopped by when I was in the area desperate to take off my acrylic nails & go back to gel on my natural nail. Lu-An was super sweet and also super fast. She also did a really cool design on each of my ring fingers-I've gotten so many compliments!! If you're looking for a new nail salon - look no further! I know I ain't- I'll definitely be a regular!< /text>

<review>Took advantage of my teen daughter who made it clear how much she had to spend, nothing more. She was provided with poor customer service. I was not at all impressed with the quality of their work and they added charges that were not requested. Requested a basic French tip pedicure and they added gel for an additional $13.00. Never bringing my daughter again and I highly recommend against spending your money here.< /review>< gmap_id>

Firstly-  Lou Ann is the best.
These beautiful women took care of 3 pedis for us at 7 on a Sunday night.
And they did a great job. Compared to other places they were so so friendly and so courteous especially with such a late job.
Will definetly be back!</review>

Only 2 people I've seen work here and their both funny and sweet. I have horrible feet (i wear boots all the time) and she took time on them!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
I left with glue all over my hands , they apply to much glue. I ask if they could do a specific design and she told me yes . I asked for coffin nails she gave me a more oval look . When she did it it came out patchy and didn’t look like what I showed her. Not only the same day I got my nails done, the paint was already peaking . They do not take pride in what they do , they rush me in and out when I was the only one there and they still charged me for their mistake. After she sanded y nails she didn’t lemme wash my hands and I had dish all over the place. She told me she was going to do a “beautiful job “ and when I told her that I isn’t what her idea, she was upset and rushed me out of there. This is the second time I’ve been here and I wasn’t happy. I thought I give them a second shot after 3 years, still no improve if anything far worse. Wasn’t satisfied with their work . It seems as if she doesn’t what she likes and not what the clients like . Definitely wouldn’t recommend this nail salon .<//Review>

I have been here before and my nails came out OK but my nail polish was horrible they missed spots and they didn't even paint the corners! This time around I went to get my nails done I got the Coffin shaped nails and I brought my own polish from home, Again LuAn didn't polish my nails properly so when I came home I took it off with Non Acetone polish remover only to see that she didn't completely fill my nails to the start of my nail bed.... When I called her today Just over a day from my visit(you need a fill by the 2nd week) she said it was because I picked my own polish as much as I explained to her she said she wouldn't fix her mistake. Never going to this place Again ! I'll stick to my original Nail Tech....</Text>

<Name>Aisha C.</Name><Review>Extremely RUDE!!!!! THE PRICE for fill is advertised as 12.99 on the window. The lady quoted me at 16.00 for a fill. When I asked why, she told me to leave. She turned my business away with absolutely NO ONE in the shop. Empty. That's how it will stay with DISHONEST practices and POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. TERRIBLE BUSINESS WOMEN.

This place was close to where I was at them moment so I figured I'd give them a try. The experiece was very unpleasant. I dont know the ladies name that sits in the first station, but she is rude and pushy. She starts off nice and sweet and telling you shes going to do "beautiful job", but the moment you shut down all her "additions" she gets upset and starts working fast and careless on your nails. She did not even oil the beds, and litterally started polishing them without having me wash them. I had  sand dust allover my hands and nails and she still tried polishing them. I had to stop her and told her I needed to go wash them first. She got upset and just waved me off and said "go go!". It was so unprofessional. Long story short,  She did such a lousy job, that I had to drive to another nail salon to get them fixed. I had told her from the start that I did not want "thick" nails, yet my nails looked like a glob of  "playdough" was on each finger, not too mention how crooked they were too! So, no way i was going to stay for a pedicure after that! Anyways. I still paid, because thats who I am, but anyone else would not have.  So think twice before you go here and keep in mind that at this nail salon,  It's not what you want done, it's what they want you to pay for that matters to them. So Beware...Good Riddance!</Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

They barely spoke any english, which made me & my husband (he accompanied me) VERY uncomfortable. They rushed me through my pedicure & manicure as well. The lady did such a rushed job that when I left the salon I still had the residule nail grit all over my hands! Very rude, very poor services, very unhygienic!

This place was horrible! My son took me and his girlfriend here on mothers day. I had to repeat my self over and over that I wanted gel but she painted my toes with regular nail polish after informing her numerous times that I wanted gel ( I only kept saying it cause she didn't get up to get the gel polish, most nail salons put your color on the little pedi table) and so when I said "no , I want gel polish (final time) they said I was difficult and mean. Um last I checked the customer can choose what their purchases are...Well long story short, between sons girlfriend and me two pedicures ($30x2) one reg full set and I'm the only one got gel polish (that by the way has bubbles galore) total came to $130.00 smh I will never come here again.<//Review>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>We noticed we had a slow leak on one of our rear tires. Happened to notice this tire shop on Whittier boulevard, we pulled in and within seconds someone came out and helped us. He replaced it quickly and let us know we should think about replaceing our tires soon because the ones on the car were worn and beginning to crack alittle. Great customer service and good prices. The only reason didn't give 5 stars is its very small and  only room for 2 cars so if another car comes you have to wait on the  street with traffic coming by being that parking along the curb was taken.</review><userid>101657974264774169963</userid></record></dataset><record>

These guys saved me with a difficult replacement of a tire.  I'd recommend them without any reservation.  Reasonable prices but service is what sets them apart.  Visit em if you need a replacement used or new tire.  You won't regret it!< /text>

< Review>
I came here because I had a nail in my tire. I was charged $15 to get the nail out. I've been to other tire shops and the most I've ever paid was $6. Waited for about 35-40 minutes because they guy was having a conversation with everyone who got there. I must say only the guy that was helping me was taking forever cause another guy fixed two cars and started another in the same amount of time. While I waited I was checking out the tire prices listed/marked on the used tires and some cost around $170 -$200each. I bought my tires brand new and they are Pirelli brand for$200each. I give them 2 stars because I think they charge too much. For $15 I expect to be in and out in 15 minutes tops. Don't think I will be back unless I really need to.<//Review>

<review>The best and Honest used quality tires around. With lower prices anywhere I've purchased use tires.  Do they penny test.  And you will compare tread wear to other stores.< /review>< pictures>

Was in and out within 20 minutes for tire rotation and a tire patchup. Also, the prices were reasonable.</review>

I needed a patch but first thing the guy said is that I needed to replace the tire cos the sidewall was bad. Then he said the bolts were bad so it's hard to put the lug nuts on. I never had any issues with the bolts before. Avoid this place, there is plenty of tire shops around east LA.< /review>

Great salon in North San Jose. I usually work with "My", she is well experienced and does a fantastic job. Book ahead of time for convenience.  $20 for a quick and good quality haircut.<//Review>

I came in for a men’s haircut and my wife was here for a women’s hair cut. My an Anna were great and were accommodating. They gave us a good haircut. Price is apt for the service they provide. Good to have an appointment. They make sure they follow all the COVID guidelines.</Text>

<Text>When it comes to men's hair cut, quality and price aren't always correlated. Here the prices are low but the quality is good. The staff is also very friendly. Been there many times and will continue to do so. Leave a generous tip to thanks them for the great work.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>Found this Hairdresser through Google due to all the favorable reviews. Was conveniently located, very clean, my barber was super friendly, and took time and care with my haircut. For $20, this is definitely the best value in the area - highly recommend.<//Review>< Pics>

After months of Shelter-in-place, my hair looks ugly. Anna gives me the color and style that I will absolutely love. The best I've had in a long, long time. Thanks Anna!< /review>

Why should I have to book? It’s a barber shop. If the person isn’t there boohoo, let the person waiting our side get a haircut. Ur not running a nail Solon.</text>

I never write reviews but I got write for this one. I would have given 0 stars if possible. With all due respect, the staff here are very polite and welcoming. I can give that but the service itself was very very low standards. They completely ruined my hair and I have few upcoming occasions that are spoiled due to this. Even after clearly giving all the instructions they either don't understand or don't care.</review>

<review>The place is neat and the service was quick for a hair cut. The staff is courtoeus and would ask you for the kind of haircut you would like.

Due to proximity to North Park and Crescent Village, most of the customers were  resident of these apartments.<//review>< pics>

< Review>
Second time coming here. The first time was great, I got exactly what I wanted!
This last time I came out with my hair WAY TOO SHORT. I have spent years growing my hair out long and healthy, to my mid back. My hair is now shoulder length when I asked for no more than two inches to be taken off. It was also layered SUPER SHORT (shortest pieces go to my chin) when I told her that if she layered it, they needed to be super long layers.
I tried living with my new hair for a bit to see if my opinion would change but I got up this morning and tried to style it and it just looks choppy. I'm honestly heartbroken. I'm debating living the first half of this year with my head in a paper bag or up in a ponytail (that I can now barely put it in).< /Review>

Nice. After having my hair butchered at JC Penney I went here to get it fixed. Was not disappointed. I can leave the house without looking like a garbage monster now 👍</text>

Very friendly staff... work and repairs were done in a 'better than expected' timely manner. Need to take trailer on a shakedown run to check quality of repairs, workmanship on shower was poor/messy, bathroom caulk seal around shower surround unit was sloppy.< /text>

< review>
I’ve used RV EXPRESS for many repairs, plus a little free advice and opinion now and then.  Their work has always been great, priced right and timely.   The owner is always available as is the service manager for questions and advice.   Then there’s Tommy the parts man.   Very helpful.   Done business with tommy on parts for close to 20 years.   He always comes up with what I need.<//review>

Did not want to be stuck with Camping World, too many bad reviews. RV Express is here in Visalia. Had several things done and some insurance work. They are definitely good and honest as far as I can tell. Their the best.< /Review>

Our body damage was not repaired correctly.  The paint does not match. Repairs very pricey.  I do agree with other review they are rude.   We have an  item missing from our motorhome- Harley  Davidson  blanket after being at their business for over 30 days.<//Review>

My child was here recently and I feel like this place can be very helpful if the child is wanting the help and especially if they have a strong support system. I liked that when I called I was treated with respect, my daughter was happy with the place. The only thing I didn't like was the "No Visits" rule due to Covid 19. I understand, but I feel like they could at least allow one parent/guardian a visit or something. The times they had to call parents or family was very limited and I missed my baby terribly. However I was extremely grateful that she would get help to be around for me to miss her when she's away, so for that I can't complain too much. My only issue with the entire place was when she was released, getting her prescriptions filled was extremely frustrating and hard to do. They were supposed to already be called in and ready to get picked up the same day. I went in the following morning, and still they didn't have my prescription, they said the hospital didn't fax the right info and it was signed by an RN, not my daughters actual Dr.
Overall I was happy with the place despite the reviews that are on the negative side.</review>

The most unprofessional staff I’ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing. DO NOT let your loved ones come here! Staff shows little to no concern about helping you get in contact with your loved ones or even giving you an update on what’s going on. Everyone seems to be new and not know what they are doing or how to get in contact with a doctor. Spoke to a “case manager” today about my loved one and she said she’s new and doesn’t know how anything operates in here as if these aren’t people’s livelihoods they are playing with and the Doctor responsible coincidentally is NEVER available to speak with. Place looks nice on the outside but they just want your money 👎🏾< /review>

I love this place. I've been 3 times to 3West and the staff are awesome. I thought the food was very good. These negative reviews are probably the people I'd see that would beat on the nurses door demanding something and get upset if it took 10 minutes. If you're cool with them they're cool with you. I would knock on the nurses door, they'd acknowledge me and I'd go sit and wait. If someone beat on my door yelling every 3 minutes i would be less than eager to help.<//review>

DO NOT send a loved one here.

1) Read every single one star review here and those on Yelp
2) Contact  Patient Advocacy for Sacramento. Ask to speak to one of the ex patients like myself who can reiterate the truth of those reviews from what they experienced and witnessed here.

IF A LOVED ONE HAS ALREADY BEEN SENT HERE  Contact Patient Advocacy for practical advice on how best to help them help themselves and avoid financial and stay duration pitfalls.

Don't give up on mental health care in California, folks. I did need help. It was appropriate that I voluntarily sought help and it was right for me and my family that I was given a 2 day hold. On the first day of my 7 day adventure I had the benefit of experiencing another facility before being transferred here.

This is not normal.< /Review>

<review>While I received beneficial treatment from my psychiatrist and group therapy, witnessed HEPA violations by the weekend nurse Karin who neglected medical/physical care to patients and made negative comments about her job and patients in the day room in front of myself and others. She also did not have the on call doctor brought to treat a patient who's blood pressure after multiple seizures was 174/96. Since I had a grand mal seizure last year I was scared for my own health and safety under her care if I had another one. Filed a grievance and they only signed the carbon copy and didn't file it. While some staff was great, knowing that these things were happening while social workers and medical doctors were not working on weekends is frightening.<//review>< Date>

I also still have nightmares of this place from over 17 years ago. It taught me that this world will eat you up when you are being already eaten by your own family (abused). Pay attention to how you are treated. This place likely needs to be shut down.<//review>

<text>Terrible experience. I was referred to go into a PHP program by my primary psychiatrist. I was involved with the outpatient  program in West Sacramento for 4 weeks prior to being abruptly discontinued due to my “insurance not covering more time” . I was then notified via mail that the program psychiatrist, Dr. Rohatgi, had disclosed to my insurance that it was not medically necessary to continue, “because I was better” after I told her numerous times my symptoms were still severe and I desperately needed more time in the program . The program consists of one 45min educational class with group, and two 45min processing groups. More than twice a week I was taken from class time to discuss frequent medication changes with the psychiatrist. In the span of 4 weeks Medication was nearly tripled(changing medication everytime I saw her).  Not okay. I have had many experiences with psychiatrists and found her not only incompetent but her treatment was actually harmful. Not to mention, Dr. Rohatgi 's arrogance, defensiveness and demeanor was hard to tolerate. This was my true experience. It caused me anxiety I had never before reached.<//text>< Pics>

This place is horrible, I just came out of this hospital. I was put in with the adolescent group, cause I am 14. Even though we are kids, they treated us with no respect and would blame us for things that wasn't out fault. One of the patients started cutting while they were In the Hall way and the staff said "there is nothing we can do about it, everyone in here just like attention" and the patient started bleeding and they refused to help her. If you have a choice, please don't come here, it doesn't help anything it only makes you more stressed. The whole time I was in there my mom was worried about my safety, because kids were constantly hitting each other and throwing things and the staff did nothing about it. I've been to different hospitals, this is by far the worst.< /review>

I just spent 4 days on their East 2 ward. Getting the medicines needed was like pulling teeth. I had to ask over and over again. I felt like a trapped animal  on this ward. I could only go from my bed to the hallway. Then pace up and down the hallway for a minimal amount of excercize .</text>

IF YOU HAVE ANY CHOICE, DO NOT COME HERE. I admitted myself voluntarily to heritage oaks for a 72 hour hold. There are VERY few people at this hospital who actually showed genuine care for the patients. The rest of the staff are only there to do the bare minimum of their job, including the psychiatrists. I was “evaluated” for hardly 5 minutes by Dr. Berci. This amount of time is not nearly sufficient to properly evaluate a patient that you have no prior knowledge of. Other than this, many nurses were rude, and acted as if even asking for water was burdening them. Heritage oaks is a place where they lock up people in mental health crises, experiment with drugs on them, and then keep the patients there much longer than necessary just to milk as much money as possible out of their insurances. If you need help, please seek out someone who can give you more direct care and one-on-one time. This place can actually be detrimental to one’s mental health due to the severe lack of respect and care.</Review>

I felt it was neccessary to leave a review because when my family was transferred from the emergency room to this hospital..the very first thing I did was look at the reviews and I was so scared ..I'm actually greatful for the staff and doctors for the support..and resources they provided and how connected they were with the patients..they stayed in contact with me and never left me feeling like they were just trying to dope someone up and store them in their facility for money ( I was thinking the worse) its clean, safe, and definitely a great place to recoup if you are willing to receive the help...thanks again for everything.</review>

Hard to get a hold of a patient if you have a family member there. Please change your staff policy, they don’t act like professionals and don’t seem to care much about the patients. This facility is just for money NOT to be helpful to their patients needs. If you have any other option don’t think it twice!<//Review>

<review>Came in struggling with a single drug addiction. Left with 4 other addictions. I could make a movie off my stay and call it the “Lab Rat”. Each day felt like a new medication. My stomach was constantly in agony. I couldn’t walk cause of all the pills , couldn’t think long enough to even speak up. I just layed there for days starting at the ceiling until they woke me up took me off all my pillls and shoved me out the front door literally. I was so messed up from all the pills they were just giving me and all of a sudden I’m on the street with none. I instantly went back to heroin plus I started using Xanax , Oxy , Seroquill and Addaral. I had a heart attack a week later and ended up getting arrested.< /review><user_id>103961159342636561534</user_id><Rating>1< /Rating>< Resp>

This place is awful. My daughter is in here and i haven't seen her. She's epileptic. I was on the phone with her and she dropped and had a seizure. I was outside and they wouldn't let me in. She's not crazy. If you ever think about calling this place. PLEASE DON'T! once i can get my daughter out of here. She'll never return. My daughter was seizure free for 9 months. Now a relapse because of this place. Please please don't come here. Frustrated!😠<//Review>

I just got released from Heritage Oaks Hospital and I was not happy with the way I was treated. I was sent there for help but I was treated like a prisoner. I was stripped down naked and everything that belonged to me was taken away. I was given a gown to wear until they could find me donated clothes. There are usually about 7 nurses in the office at a time and it can take upwards of ten minutes before a nurse will address you, even if they have seen that you are waiting for them. The showers flooded into our room and the images they have of the rooms are nothing like the bare rooms with thin white blankets and rock hard beds that I saw (And there are laptops in the images, we weren't even allowed to have phones). The nurses noisily walk in and out of the room every 15 minutes at night to check on you and when you tell them that you didn't sleep well, they assume its because you have a problem with the treatment. The nurses don't listen to any complaints you might have and it can take up to 2 hours to get you pain medication for period cramps. The only people who seemed to care about us or give an honest evaluation were the actual psychiatrists, that you can only see once a day, if you are lucky. The social workers and nurses talk to us like we are children and don't give us the respect of talking to us like real human beings. I am tired of being condescended to. I hope for your sake you can find a better place for treatment to get well.<//Review>

DO NOT SEND ANYONE YOU CARE ABOUT HERE!!!!!
Rude staff that treat you and the patients like criminals. Doctors do not return phone calls, they don’t even work for this place. They are “independent contractors” so that allows both parties to point fingers and pass the blame.
You will need an attorney! They put everyone with insurance on a longer than 72hr hold so they can collect more money. Stay away! They will NOT help, only make things worse.

Dr Kim... I look forward to seeing you in front on the medical review board!< /Review>

Review is for the adolescent in patient heritage oaks psychiatric hospital.  Really no way to describe the inhumane treatment at this prison. This receives the lowest rating in all categories.  If it were possible to give below a one star that would be my review. If you are a parent reading this you should do everything in your power to avoid your child being put here, you have better options.<//Review>

My experience at heritage oaks was nothing short of positive. The staff was wonderful and helpful. With all the  resources they had available to us ,you can't help but get better . I'd go to Heritage oaks again if I needed to. People who say they didn't get help are people who weren't ready to get help.  Trust me this place is GREAT!!!!!!<//text>

<text>I went here a little over a year ago. I walked in a wide eyed, terrified 13 year old. But as soon as I went in I could feel the positive vibes despite how late it was. They were a little late with meds, yes, but were really efficient with it from there on. The staff actually treats us like PEOPLE and you can tell they really care. They are very flexible to fit your needs and the groups were boring but they helped a lot in the long run. They never let you go hungry. The staff made visitation easy and made sure it ran smoothly. Debra was sooo incredibly sweet! Jeremy was really chill and understanding. Joy was a complete ANGEL who advocated for all of us like a mother figure. The rest of the staff were really great too and made you feel comfortable there. Defiantly would recommend!< /text>< pictures>

Social workers are a little hard to get a hold of but my social worker was good.

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>i swear i got PTSD from this place. So long story short, some dude who was coming down off of black tar heroin was having a mental breakdown ans decided to say he had a knife. The entire situation was not handled correctly and eventually the guy got a hold of a fire extinguisher (note these things are locked up), he then decide to spray the entire lobby with it in an attempt to break out, which he did. The staff didn't know what to do so were all just sitting in fumes we shouldn't be breathing in for over 20 minutes. Eventually the fire department comes to evacuate us outside and im over here throwing up over and over again ( i guess i inhaled to many fumes causing me to be low on oxygen). In the end to help me feel better this place gave me some "sleeping pills" to make me feel better lmao. What a great place am I right? Also they dont allow the regulated 1 hour outside everyday, which i believe in against california laws. I may be wrong but i got more daily outside time when i was locked in juvy.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Because I have complained more the one time this place is horrible
The one thing I did enjoy over my stay was the view of the ufo lights shown on unsolved mysteries that made my night enjoyable. I am so happy I have a visual memory of these flashing lights this is what I get for laying with the black and blue oh boy Petaluma police must be the worst police and racist is the stabilization in Santa Rosa any better ?<//Text>

I urge you to avoid this place.  It's much more like a prison than a hospital.  In 72 hours the doctor assigned to our friend saw him ZERO minutes.  He never even met her.   Another doctor saw him for a total of 10 minutes.  Doctors returned NO phone calls to family, and didn't even return a phone call from the patient's therapist. They treat patients with disdain and they treat family members worse.  On weekends there is a "moonlighting" doctor, who "doesn't have time" to see everyone, so they expect patients to simply vegetate all weekend until the doctors are done with their weekends.  A reputable medical facility is staffed 24/7.  This is not a reputable medical facility.<//review>

Spent from 8/3/18 to 8/8/18 in their inpatient program. The psychiatrist, Dr. Singh spoke to me twice in the 5 days I spent there. Each of the two times lasted less then ten minutes in duration. He incorrectly diagnosed me with a serious mental health issue in that first appointment and prescribed me medication that I informed him I had an adverse reaction to.

On the fifth, I had my hearing to determine whether or not I was fit to be sent home. It was during that time that I learned that the doctor’s notes about me said I was constantly suicidal and fixating on suicide even though I had been adamant since the beginning of my hospitalization that I had not been suicidal at any time during this ordeal. In that hearing, my patient advocate informed the person overseeing my hearing that I was the third person in a row that day who had notes in their file that were glaringly false. A nurse who had been overseeing my unit during my duration was called in to speak when Dr. Singh was unreachable and she recalled my stay there exactly as I had and I was able to be discharged.

This hospital is nothing but a for profit institution that does not pretend to be anything else once you are admitted. There were no therapists or psychologists on staff to speak to patients one on one. There was just group therapy that dealt with prechosen topics.

This experience meant that I spent 5 days not getting any of the help that I needed and instead was ignored and just given the incorrect medications.

If you have the choice, do not go to this inpatient program it’s not beneficial at all.< /Text>

<rating>1</rating><review>I have been to Heritage Oaks Inpatient on one occasion and several Outpatient programs. I have had problems with the staff and their behavior towards me on more than one occasion. While I my latest visit I was sitting in class and raised my had several times and was ignored my the therapist. He was more interested in talking than he was in answering patient questions. Towards the end of class he began to argue with me over two points. I told him I was not capable of working and had had 11 years of intensive therapy and was told that mental health is my career. The therapist gave me a one word response with no explanation, "Nope", Stunned I told him I was having trouble understanding the boat load of documentation and that it was difficult for me to learn and again he replied, "Nope" without any follow up as to why he thinks so. So then I called a meeting with the program manager and to my disbelief he out right lied and did it with a smile. I was so stunned that he in order to preserve himself through me under the bus. I would not recommend this facility to others, however it has worked for some people, it just depends on who your therapist is. I would recommend going to Sutter Center for Psychiatry, they are non-profit and are suppose to be the best in the local area.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x809ad937edd33fff:0xa812a96c69e1cd01< /Gmap_id></record>

<Review>This hospital is the worst in sacramento. Im homeless and brought a learherman and a baton there and they told me i could pick it up but then when i went to pick it up they had me waiting outside for 2 hours only to tell me that they couldnt give it to me. The leatherman was my only way to eat while being homeless and the baton was the only way to keep myself safe. I now havent eaten in 2 days and have no way to defend myself if i get jumped. My life is more at risk after being released than it was before i entered. Not only that but while inpatient i got into an unprovoked assault with someone who outweighed me by a hundred pounds and had my lip cut in half with a 2 and a half centimeter laceration while the nurses stood there and did nothing. It was 3 other patients who held the person back and after i stopped the bleeding they refused me
medical care and i had to have my lawyer call to threaten legal action in order to get my lip stitched up at the hospital. After returning i wasmt transferred to a seperate unit and remained around this violent person for 2 whole days before i was able to feel safe. That given the staffs general lack of competence and not informing the patients of full information regarding policies that affect the patients upon release make this not only a horrible but downright dangerous hospital to stay at. This place should be shut down</Review></record>

As a visitor to this facility the front desk staff was kind and helpful however when on the phone, I found them to be rude.  I was hung up on two separate occasions, also transfered to wrong departments, I  was even told once that my family member was not there (he was).  When dropping off clothes I was told he already received them, I  asked how if I'm standing outside the door holding them. Its been only three days and I'm frustrated and having serious second thoughts on my loved one being there.< /text>

<Text>Heritage Oaks literally saved my life. I was admitted multiple times for suicide watch & September 2011 I was sent to out patient with an incredible staff, very supportive & the structure combined with medication assistance & transportation.

I had my problems with staff, but over all the environment was positive & now, 2 years after the experience I'm re-entering the work force. I am no longer suicidal & continue to maintain sobriety.

It is what you chose to get from it. The services are there if you are ready & willing to move forward. Thank you.<//Text>< Pics>

For the people who had a good experience good for you.  I brought my child in for an evaluation at the suggestion of my doctor and therapist.  When they said they wanted to keep her inoluntarily  until the psychiatrist could assess her I was fine.  The doc called me while I was in the building and said he wanted  to change her from involuntary to voluntary I was fine with him observing her and treating her.  Somehow between our conversation at 1:03 pm  a nurse crosses out the doctors change from voluntary to unvoluntary.  No one calls me about the change or discusses it with me.  Mind you this is a 16 yo in their custody.  Nurse Ratchet and she knows who she is says my child is on involuntary hold for up to 14 days.  I ask for the papers and she refuses to give them to me.  I have to ask my child to go to the nurses station get a copy and give it to me.  Full of blatant lies, because I was texting my daughter's primary care physician the whole time.  We never refused voluntary treatment.  They then coerced us into signing  a voluntary form which we already agreed to verbally just to make the false hold go away.  You have been warned.  Enter this facility at you or your family members own risk.  Every counselor, physician or normal human being that I have shared my story with has been horrified.  You have been warned.  I am just grateful that I got my child out of that place.  I hope someone from Heritage Oaks Hospital is reading this and know that I have told everyone who would listen what happened to me and my child.  Even if it takes years and an act from the legislature, I am going to tell my story and my primary care physician has documented the chart and will back me 200%.  If you fail to heed the warning or find out after the fact, tell everyone you know, so that others can stay clear of this Twilight Zone of a facility.  I have communicated with attorneys and patients rights advocates.  Judgment day is coming.< /text>

HOH is a place to avoid if at all possible. Based on our horrendous experience there it is deserving of no ranking at all....which, coincidentally, is consistent with UC Davis managed medical and mental clinical facilities in comparison with ranked facilities nationwide.  A very inhospitable and hazardous place to enter and subject to extreme malpractice, tortious and criminal conduct.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>I was a paietent here. They look you in your room and choose your meals and food if you don’t obey them. They gave me medcine that made me gain 60 pounds in one month. It made my chorestorl high and this one lunch man would tease me for my lactose intolerance and that I’m allergic to almost everything they had. One lady was super mean to me and my roommate who was there because her foster parents drugged her and her parents put her in the middle of the street alone in a dumpster as a baby. She is so strong after some people has treated her horrible. Some staff are super kind and caring. But what is illegal is that they had college students come and experiment on the patients which made me feel like a rat for scientists own good. I refused and stood up for myself. Which I was locked in my room for three days without interaction with kids or anything. When I asked for my books the staff didn’t care enough to give me my books and I was bored and felt lonely. I got bullied there and I have insecurities I didn’t even have before. One lady stood by my phone and would try and make me say things while I was talking to my family! How embarrassing!Not enough outside time which made me have lack of Vitiamin D and since I couldn’t eat a lot they thought I had an eating disorder and I have struggled with it back in 6th grade and 7th but right now I’m going into the 10th grade and I just been getting more and more allergic and intolerant to some foods. The social workers didn’t seem to be bored listening to my rape story but they cared I don’t understand it but they did. Out of 10 I would say 5 it has helped me with a lot in life but it also had some negative impact too. I wouldn’t highly suggest going here but if your adoselcent ends up here, don’t worry, everything will be okay :)<//text>< pictures>

Their ambulance sent my injured schizophrenic cousin to mercy san juan and when she was released apparently sent her to a different mental health agency. The whole time not letting us know anything. We gave my cousin our phones numbers, since she had no phone on her, to call us and we heard nothing. She was scared to be left alone here in the first place, so we told her make sure to contact us so we can see you. And nothing......now 5 days later, after constant bugging, we were told "I suggest you look elsewhere"...although they still would not confirm or deny she was there.
Horrible place.< /Text>

Heritage Oaks is a very decent mental health facility.  If you have the choice,  choose them instead of aome of the others. Horror story upon horror story. I was actually admitted to Heritage Oaks for a week and the only negative comments I have are referring to the security and sime of the nighttime staff who can act like bullies at times.< /text>

I went here twice..once in April and once in May(i cant remember fully). I remember having a roommate who slept all day and night. Being in the mental facility, there are all different likes of people and crazies, lol. Sometimes the food is good(but i remember i was fasting..which i regret not eating some of the food i would have eaten) if it wasnt for the fact my schizophrenic ways didnt stop me. Plus they force or tell you to eat the food, or you wont be discharged or let go early. Also you u have to do groupings, they have patio time, art time, gym time and the usual of breakfast, lunch & dinner. Plus the lounge..which has a tv, books/magazines and crayons and coloring books etc. Aswel as tea, juice sometimes snacks in the lounge and water. I remember having to do blood test check ups every day/night, they take your heart pressure and etc. I wouldnt mind going to the mental facility again. But im better now and i remember i had trouble sleeping. Plus boredom was a biggie...there wasnt much to do and thats why i wanted to get out already. The most you could do was walk in circles...plus its coed. Still it was a cool experience to look back on. I remember always calling my sisters or aunt all the time(the phone by the lounge). Or seeing the social worker and doctor or whatever to do my check up or to see how long i had to stay there. The first time i went there...i stayed bout a week and the second time i went there, i stayed from Thursday til Tuesday. I was suppose to stay longer than that, but had a court hearing and was able to get out early. You have to do alot of paperwork when getting out though. I have went to another mental facility but i forgot what it was called(that one i stayed for 2 weeks and a half).<//Review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>Most terrifying stay in this type of place I ever experienced in my life.  Being as to having a life long struggle with mental issues that are not even close to dangerous to others in any case presented through out my life time I was treated as though I had attempted to assassinate the president or something.
I had not gotten disruptive I followed all the rules,I was social enough ,ate the food, gain all good behavior points available and was friendly as I always am.
The staff had some kind of relentless hatred toward me like a pregidace or the KKK or something that I can't even think of any cause .I'm not even a minority or what ever to have any kind of this to dilude my mental state .
They were very abusive towards me and others that were so very submissive and polite almost as if they couldn't stand friendly smiling people being polite or kind to them.
I am a very nice social person. I believe in knowing names to go with faces and making sure when speaking to a person to state their name clearly so as to confirm acknowledge ment of that conversation with them more personally . They kept saying my name wrong I just politely kept stating the correct way to pronounce it and if they couldn't please use my nickname but was rudely harassed over this and when I stood up to say to a nurse that I would appreciate if she could please stop the rude attitude and not talk in such a sarcastic way and the right way to pronounce my name I was tackled as if I attacked her and strapped  down like Jesus style to a huge concrete slab in a tiny room,where from behind a closed door through a tiny window all the staff stared and laughed at me making fun of me and my name just to harass me some more . After being strapped down for hours without food or water I began to cry and begged them to let me out in which they responded with even more rude laughter and gathered more staff to come to laugh with them,when I escaped from the straps myself and took off out of the room I was tackled and  given injections of some sorts in which I was pretending to be knocked out cold from ,so when they got off I took off running for my life,made it to outside where u ran into some real doctors who seen how freaked out I was and took me In the office to fill out the papers to set me free, I had been sent on false claims of drug abuse and even though I passed drug tests they gave I was still held as a prisoner and it all because I had a siezure of course in which they blamed on the drug abuse that I had tested clean . Now my mental problem is worse then ever I'm paranoid everywhere I go and won't even consider going to a doctor or hospital even when dying of neumonia.
I would rather be sick and die first.
I am scared for my life now. I feel as if I am being laughed at everywhere I go and that people are trying to kill me . I am being stalked daily I am not sure if it had anything to do with the time of this but I do know I was never like this before. I used to love my stays in the hospital and visits with my doctor's for the fact I don't have friends or family to be there for me anymore do to deaths so  looked forward to the friendly doctors n nurses that I would see once or twice a month giving me social contact now I'm never gonna go back to any place that can keep me from leaving or have any control over my meds or food.
I can no longer go and get treated for anything for the fear of being attacked in a brutal or mentally harassing way by people I'm expected to put the trust of my life .
This place and other places like this should be regularly watched for abuse if patients who are incapable of being understood or taken for their word because the lable of crazy that is put on their name most of these patients are not crazy but labeled 5150 anyway so they can't stand up to say for themselves the abuse at the fact their words are cast aside as they are thought to not have the mentality to know what they are saying or must not be understanding the situation correctly.
It's insane that they would hire people to deal with these problems that have no tolerance.<//review><Time>1494261078741<//Time>< Rate>

TL;DR  Are you looking for an extended stay at inpatient facility where rarely see the light of day, will be treated worse than most prisoners are, and want to kill yourself more than you ever have in your whole life? Then Heritage Oaks Hospital is right for you!

This place is hell on Earth. I implore anyone who may consider putting a family member here or anyone who may end up here involuntarily or voluntarily to seek out any other facility. You will see a psychiatrist for roughly 5-10 minutes every other day. All but a single nurse, treated every patient there like absolute garbage. They ignore you for as long as humanly possible. I even witnessed people having sever panic attacks be completely ignored, even though they are sitting a few feet away with a clear line of site. They have simple lost any compassion or empathy that I doubt they ever had to begin with. You are trapped inside what is basically a hallway. Even with engaging with other patients you will likely find yourself bored, anxious, and claustrophobic the majority of the time due to the lack of stimuli. They offer crayons (continuing the theme of treating patients like incompetent children) but no paper on which to draw or write. You will be blessed with fresh air for some 10 minutes a day in a small, depressing courtyard surrounded my tall, menacing looking fences (it's quite the pick me up). But they don't stop at treating you like the scum of the Earth, they want to keep treating you terribly for as long as possible. All they care about is the hundreds of dollars a day it apparently costs to house the patients. EVERY single patient I was in with on a 51-50, was kept for an additional 72 hours past the legal hold. Why would they stop there if they only cared about money? Because only after six days are patients allowed to receive a Patient's Rights Advocate and actually refute their internment. Need even more examples of their money-hungry ways? One patient I was in with voluntarily checked themselves in, after which they put on involuntary hold, so they could no longer leave. A person who realizes that they should be in a safe environment for a time, then puts themselves into a safe environment was deemed unfit to make decisions for themselves and not allowed to leave when they thought that they were better?! You get a paper stating why you are put on continued hold by the psychiatrist. Most of the time it says some vague, nonsense about being at risk for suicide. Even though most of us bullshitted about how good the facility was and how we were improving so much to get out faster. My favorite reason someone received for staying though was that they were apparently an alcoholic and would relapse.  The funny thing was that person had never drank or done drugs. Either that's malpractice or a complete lack of actually getting to know your patients. Even if this place wasn't after money, they would still be the least caring, understanding, and helpful on the planet. I could go on forever about how bad this place is but to put it simply: If you end up at Heritage Oaks Hospital, YOU WILL NOT GET BETTER. They do not and will not put forth more than the bare-minimum, legal effort to support their jobs. People in medicine should be do it because they love medicine and people, not because it's a stable job. There were one or two RNs or LVNs there that did actually treat us like human beings. It was just such a rare occurrence in that place though; I honestly would not expect it.</Text>

The staff is rude the place is disorganized the doctors don't take time to care for their patients properly. It is a very poorly ran ship that is sinking fairly quickly. If you know someone who needs psychiatric help this is NOT the place! Try Sierra Vista<//Text>

Every time I go there or call they are short with me on the phone. Lack customer service. We eventually did purchase compost from them (big mistake). The compost was completely dead. It was bone dry, no aroma etc. I recommend checking or testing it prior to purchasing. Other people who have used them told me they had the same issues with the compost. Unaware of other product quality they offer. I am guessing the compost we got from them was overheated.< /review>

Check the hours before you go. Call before you go to make sure they have what you need in stock. I get the free mulch, which does have yeah in it and scrolls bad but it's really good at matting down to hold hillsides in place.<//text>

It is an easy economical and reliable place to get garden mulch. It is also a cheap spot to dispose of yard waste. Its a lot less expensive than the landfill a little ways up the road.

<Review>I've been going here for almost 5 years now. Very friendly and professional employees and family owned. By far one of the best washouts in the area. They're also cheap $24 for hot wash and very quick. I'm always in and out in 10min</Review><GmapID>0x80c2c8cc1baab62f:0x29e02d8396ee4c14</GmapID>< username>

<text>I have been buying pallets from Dale's for over a year.  They are quick to load the different carriers I send in and always have what I need.  I do not know what i would do without these guys.  All of my Los Angeles customers require pallet exchange.  Norm is always helpful and  so is his staff.  Can't beat their prices or service.< /text>< pics>

The trailer wash is better than the neighbors, cost less, and the people care more about doing a good job.  I recommend this place for a trailer wash in this area now..<//text>

<Text>DO NOT turn into the "entrance" under the sign with the arrow! That is actually the exit. Turn in at the sign with the green truck. And they only wash out trailers.  And there's only a few (1-4) parking spots. They lock the gate when they close for the night.  Otherwise it's $22 and they do a decent job. You can get a fax here also.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Not your Typical Olive Garden! Save your $$ This top sirloin plate cost me $19.29!  Poorly presented, dry steak, wilted broccoli,  and poorly dressed zucchini. Manager was not apologetic and simply said she would change it out. When she had the server bring the plate back, they only changed the plate, gave fresh broccoli and added pasta to my plate (which I didn't want in the first place). Manager didn't even come back to check on us or discount the food and this was all after waiting for a half hour to be seated in the first place.  This manager has no idea what she is doing and running the restaurant into the ground.  Very sad.</Text>

Well, due to the pandemic we had to wait in our vehicles to be seated. They told us an hour but it was more like 20 minutes. Yay! After seated,  out waiter was right there taking our order. The wait time was not long. Food received hot and delicious.  The waiter was very responsive and attentive. Patient with the kids as they ordered and asked for refills. It was my little ones birthday and he more than earned the tip we presented. Everyone was happy.<//Text>

If I could give a half a star, I would. I ordered sea food Alfredo and it was cold. It taste like it was cook in the morning and they just slapped it on the plate. My friend ordered shrimp pasta with a wine sauce on the side, her pasta was dry and shrimp was cold and uncooked, the sauce was so salty that she couldn't even eat it.. the only food that was good was the calamari. DO BETTER OLIVE GARDEN!<//Text>

The quality of the food; Subpar, steaks passed well done when I asked for medium and, the Alfredo was cold and honestly quite dry.
The people were nice and friendly.
Disgusting food, I told my grandma not to go.<//text>

<Review>Amazing staff! Amazing food! It's been years since I have eaten at olive garden so it was nice to go back! Was super excited when I saw the zucchini noodles with grilled chicken dish in the menu! Was beginning to think I was going to have to spoil myself on my diet. But thrilled to have seen it on the menu made my visit back even more enjoyable!<//Review>< pictures>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Enjoyed a delightful dinner with my husband in a "safe" (socially distanced) environment where the staff members were attentive, properly wearing masks, kind and efficient.  Olive Garden is predictable. It doesn't pretend to be something it's not. The food is good, the portions more than generous, the surroundings pleasant. It's a standard "go to" place for our family.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>My server, as well as some assisting servers, was very friendly, very attentive, but not too overbearing. My drinks, appetizers, and food were all brought out expeditiously, but not so soon that I was unable to finish the previous item. I also noticed that the staff were very thorough with sanitation. Amazing meal, will definitely come back soon!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<review>Waitress did not do her job. We are a repeat cust. Customary to serve bread stick along with glass of water before placing order. She served people first that were seated 10 minutes after us maybe because her same kind. Did not really enjoy our time. Still we left a tip but after looking back we should have not left any. We asked for their wine sample and she never
brought out any. Did not eat any main dish after much have no appetite.</review>< UserId.>

I love the freshness of their food, the unlimited crunchy fresh salad and the unlimited delicious puffy garlic stick breads.I had the chicken primavera, i requested with extra sauce, it was soooo delicious, and the best part was that for $12.99 I got to eat there and also I was able to take a plate to eat at home.<//text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>Not really a fan but my girlfriend loves this place. They have a few dishes I enjoy. Been wanting to try one of their breadstick sandwiches for quite some time. Unfortunately they are only available during lunch. Finally got to try one and they forgot my cheese. There's only 4 ingredients to this sandwich and they only made it to 3. So I'll forget to give them a couple of stars.</review>< Pics>

<Review>Ordering take out from here for the first time, wasnt sure what to expect. I am happy/pleased to say it was our best choice. The portions were very generous, very tasty and fresh! The Moscato wine, by recommendation, was the cherry on top! Can't wait to go back! Thank you Olive Garden! All take care and stay well!

<Text>Wow! So much more than just pasta!! Everything was delicious and the service was the BEST!!! Be aware, there's a "wait list" option online, but the timing was not accurate.  The whole 45 minute drive there, it claimed no wait time (yes, I refreshed my screen each time I checked the status), but once we walked in the door - 10 minute wait for a table. Maybe not crucial to some, but we needed to squeeze a birthday dinner in prior to working the night shift so it was important to us.<//Text></record>

The service was bad in my opinion. The food had a different taste to it. My husband ordered the lasagna and said that it tasted funny. He only ate about half of it and didn't want anymore because of how it tasted. My fedaccini tasted different, like a strange taste at the end of a bite. My lemon cake was really good. When the waitress boxed up our leftover food, I asked for the salad also. So she boxed the two bowls of salad together, the only problem was that their were two different dressings in the two bowls of salad. Bottom line is that I've had better tasting food and service than I did tonight!<//Text>

<Text>The Olive Garden was a lovely experience. Howe er, it was more expensive than I had expected. $70 for two people before the tip. But the foodbwas very good and I did order seafood and a medium sized order of house wine. Very tasty nonetheless.< /Text>< Pictures>

The food was extremely good and they always bring salad and bread. The pasta here is very good and there are so many types of different pastas that you could choose from. Great service too.</Text>

<Review>I really wish Olive Garden would bring back some of the more classic dishes. Some of the newer dishes make it hard to have a cohesive meal. Overall cleanliness was an issue, our server however was really polite and very attentive.<//Review></record>

<text>I think olive garden is about as good as it gets for the price range. One thing I was not happy about. In the bar there are no place mats. This is probably a health code violation. I don't want my silverware on a dirty surface. Service was good all in all a positive experience as always.<//text></record>

Vallejo store has stepped their game up. Usually don't care for Olive Garden in Vallejo but today's lunch was the best I've had at this location. 45-minute wait for to go order and restaurant was constantly full while I was there. Must be a good sign it may be time for a dinner date Olive Garden Vallejo. Glad to see them doing well< /Review>

<Date>1559584669430</Date><Text>I really hate to give a review like this but it's been on my mind for an entire day now. We visited this store 6/2/19 around 6pm. To be honest, our server was tweaking out on something. It was very uncomfortable. He gradually got better but this olive garden needs to be looking at their servers while working, because this was not exceptable. We waited 15 min after ordering to get our drinks. When my soup came it literally had 5  small pasta shells (we counted), a few large tomatoes, and a ton of spinach. We waited for an exceedingly long amount of time to even see the server again so we just shared the salad. The meal was very good. That's all I can think positive to say. He never returned and we left without getting any boxes using the card reader at the table. Please look into this. Please be more responsible.< /Text><Rate>1</Rate>< name>

Went for my daughter in laws birthday. They were out of her entree and dessert she wanted.  The wait staff was slow.  Over 15 minutes before we got our salad and soup.   Never offered or received any refills on our drinks. The waitress was very friendly just not attentive.</Review>

The customer service is ok, but the food is average, at best. I got a to go order and the food was something that would come out of a mac & cheese box or something - bland, cold and stiff. I only rated 3 stars because they were very polite to my father, but in reality the food isn't very good at all. So pricey for average, or below average, food. I wouldn't waste money here so good thing I spent a gift card that was given to me.</text>

<review>It's Olive Garden, so you get the usual fine Italian fare. Unfortunately, a few hiccups made for a substandard experience. Our server was very nice, but a few communication miscues somewhere along the line led to mixed up orders and dropped soup and bread stick refills (which was more of a problem since some in our party ordered the soup, salad, and bread sticks meal). At least one meal was only warm at best, though mine was hot. Ultimately not a great experience.</review>< pictures>

<review>Awesome food and portions!

Service strangely was TOO attentive. Somehow we ended up with two people attending to our table, and every 3 minutes someone was walking by and asking us how things were. It really made having a conversation very difficult. Attentive service is very important to me, but in this case it was way over the top.

Then, our main server was hovering over us when the bill came waiting for the receipt to be signed. REALLY?! We did ask her to come back, but then she wanted her pen back before she left. A few minutes later I went to the hostess and asked if I could borrow a pen, and she let me have one, but strangely she followed me halfway to the table. If there is such paranoia about letting a pen out of your sight, then management is doing a poor job of supplying basic necessities to their staff, which unfortunately has the result of making guests uncomfortable.</review></record></dataset><record>

My dinner was not the best.  Everyone else's in my party, was very good. Next time I'll know not to order the chicken parmesan,  lasagna,  and fettuccine.  The fettuccine was very good though.  Service was excellent.  Very nice staff.<//Review>

<Review>We went to this location for my birthday and waited 20 minutes and were seated on a table next to their kitchen, it smelled so awful and the floors were jut so dirty throughout the restaurant...I could not stay to eat, I love Olive Garden but had never had this experience before...I looked to the side where they served the drinks and where the kitchen were and could not believe how dirty and awful it looked down there, we just got up and walked away. I’ve been to the San Francisco location and other locations and never have I had such a bad experience at Olive Garden. We were planning to come to this location more often but never again.< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
This restaurant has a bad history with customer service. I have not had a good experience with them in years. Even on to-go orders they tend to make “mistakes”. Today I ordered a Sicilian Cheesecake with strawberries to go. I get home and they forget to put the strawberries.</Review>

I used the online ordering and picked up my food for a lunch break. Andrea was AWESOME. Super nice and accommodating while I waited. She made sure my order was on point and even hooked me up with a few extras when my wait took a bit longer. Thanks again girl !<//review>

We had starters of calamari, meatballs and something else. We had for our mains - chicken masala, fettuccine, soup and salad. Food were of good quality and service was fantastic. The girl who served us was very friendly and was very knowledgeable of the menu. Will definitely go back there.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Review>The wait is long, no reservations accepted. The Mediterranean Scampi was horrible. Pasta was like soggy top ramen noodles. My daughter couldn't even eat her pasta in marinara because the pasta was over cooked. The service there was nice. However for the price we paid it wasn't worth it.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Name>Alvaro Guevara (Yoguh)<//Name><Review>We frequent this restaurant and had decent service over the years, sometimes excellent service. We've decided to come here an hr before closing and will never again go this late.

When we arrived, it was a 30 min wait, which was fine. We ideally wanted to go in the Cafe, but none of the tables were bussed. After a while of waiting, the hostess asked us if we wanted to sit in the Cafe which was still not bussed. It was eventually cleaned off and we sat down.

We had no silverware, the waiter was slow, got our soup/salad before the drinks. The employees were complaining about not being able to go home on time. Our waiter was asked to clock out, but he told her that he wasn't going to leave without getting his tips. I understand that it's a Sunday and it was a busy day, but I've never been in a restaurant with all this nonsense. The food was the best it's ever been. Just don't show up here an hr before closing. You'll have the worst service imaginable.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Brian J. in particular is amazing. Great service, such a gentleman. He is willing to accommodate to your needs and he gave us plenty of time to look at our menus to decide what we wanted to drink as well as what we wanted for our meals. Once we were getting ready to leave, Brian offered to give us a salad and breadsticks to go, something other servers wouldn’t usually offer. Brian J. Is amazing and I highly recommend anyone who goes to this Olive Garden to be served by him.

< Review>
Olive Garden is a great Italian restaurant that offers a wide variety of Italian style foods at reasonable prices. They usually offer a deal for seniors at certain times and days that makes it worth going. Their breadsticks are great. The restaurant is clean and the staff are usually courteous. The restaurant is often busy at meal times so plan accordingly. They have a free parking lot with a few handicapped spots.</Review>

The food was perfect..the server we had was terrible. She made a joke that was borderline racist. Well my husband was very offended. She never smiled once. Judged us based off our looks and left us alone to fend for ourselves in the handicapped  section. We were a family of 6 with a child in wheelchair.  We spent 170 and tipped 35% just to show her that despite how we look our race..we are not judging her she shouldn't  us<//Text>

I used to take my family to your restaurant years ago when salads were plentiful, portions were over the top delicious. Times have changed. Skimpy portions. Especially the eat one in, take one home. No options for modification to any take home item.
My colleagues did not like being called guests. As one said, "Guests should be eating for free because they are a guest". You wouldn't charge your guests at home for a dinner you prepared. She had a good point. We are still paying customers. Come up with another word, but not guest.
Still like your salad and the women enjoyed their soups.</text>

Disappointed, trying to place a to-go order with who ever was on shift was painful and of course the order was wrong when we arrived and needed to be corrected at the restaurant. The fettuccine alfredo was 95% pasta 5% sauce so it was basically just pasta. Luckily we had a jar of alfredo sauce at home that salvaged the meal. We had the same problem with the  marinara sauce that was on the spaghetti with chicken parmigiana. I hope tonight's experience was just an off night for everyone involved.</Text>

Well, first things first. We used to love Olive Garden. Sadly, our last few experiences have not been up to par with what we expect. Thing is not just your particular restaurant but ranges all the way from Philadelphia to San Francisco. The quality of the food has finished. The quality of the wines has diminished(Sutter Home????Really). As an example, my wife and I have both, at different times and places, purchased the Asiago Chicken dish that is back on your menu and the chicken was grisly and chewy and well as being a small portion.

Also, the spaghetti sauce is now super sour. It has always been a little sour for my taste but that is acceptable when you have large amount of pasta to go with it (I never purchase the sauce and always go for something Alfredo or otherwise).  I know you would have rather I sent you a private email, but I thought I would share this review.

Aldo, I do appreciate you responding to my negative review, even if it is automated.

P.S.  I still like the soup, salad and breadsticks!<//Text>

I received perfect service the last time I went to the Olive Garden in Vallejo., California. The Food was perfect as well. I had even gotten the Table by the window I had asked for.  I guess I has just gotten Super lucky that day, but I usually get good food and service from this particular Olive Garden, anyway. 😊< /text>

Group of 6 arrived at 3:19. Were told 15-20 minutes wait. 4 other groups waiting. 4:30-10 groups have been seated, and we are still waiting. Son fell asleep on the waiting both. No apologies nor acknowledgements from the staff. Seems they’re waiting for us to leave. Such disappointment from such a great place.<//Text>

<review>I used to love this location, that is until some friends and I went there one night and our waitress just completely blew it. She acted like she was drunk, reeked of alcohol, somehow forgot to input our order but continued to serve people that came after us while telling us she was going to see what was going on with our order. 45 minutes later brings out an order that contained nothing that we had ordered. We finally had given up on her and put an order through the little computer thing at our table. I go to pay through the computer and it says I owe for two orders! One from the previous customers and our order. I ask her to fix it and she takes my card and says she'll take care of it. She ends up charging me for both orders and then refunding it and does it again which locks up my credit card. She tells me were good to go but fails to give me a receipt. As we're walking out  the manager accuses us of trying to leave without paying and the waitress is nowhere to be found. I then get told I have to pay with a different payment method after the manager checks their system and says my payment hadn't gone through. I ended paying cash and by this time I am furious. I get home and realize the desserts we had asked for as to go I had been charged for but never received! I drive back to the location and let them know of their error and the hostess gets our desserts but we received no apology and were basically ignored by both the manager and our worthless waitress. Come to find out the next day the charge HAD gone through on my card and since I had also paid cash that meant I was double charged. It took me 3 weeks to deal with the dispute with my credit card company. Ugh, I haven't been there since due to their stupidity.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

The Vallejo location is great. Famous Olive Garden food with the best service compared to others. Good staff and servers. It's a 30 minute drive for me, while others in the chain are closer, I chose to drive it for great experience.<//text>

Me and my parents went there and right off the bat they didn't give my mother her fork for the salad she ordered, so it took us a will to get someone to assist us.  Second I ordered medium rare sirloin with the alfredo and got it completely cooked and dry.  Honestly I get better service at a fast food chain.<//Text>

Family members and I needed a nice place to recover from a moment o sadness  and this was the perfect place.  The staff were very attentive and uplifting with their delivery of customer service.  My apologies for not making a mental note of our waitress, but we were a large group of 8 people, to the left in the back by the window around 2:30 on 02/22/2019. The hostess was also very friendly.  Thank you to all of the assistanting staff members.< /text>

I see all these bad reviews and I'm wondering what happened? My husband and I decided to have a much needed date night and he surprised me by coming here! I've never been here before and I must say, it was absolutely amazing! We had 2 servers because our original one was on break when we came in, but they where both superb. Our drinks, appetizers, and my alcoholic drink came super fast. Not even 20 min later our main courses where served. I've had several differents kinds of lasagna, one even from a woman who was only visiting the U.S.. This beat all those other ones!! Amazing! You have to try it if you come here. Oh and we came at 5pm on a Friday night.< /text>

I rated it a 3 because at 5pm, we had an hour and half wait. We thought getting there by 5pm we would get seated quickly. We were wrong.
But the Bartender, Sara, was awesome & friendly but slammed.
Our waitress, Fatima, was wonderful.. we had a birthday celebration & she was great, always checking in, got everything right, helped with the cake we got. She knows her stuff.. Thank you Fatima.</Review>

There’s plenty of parking at this location and if you get there before 6:30, you’ll likely be seated right away. This was our experience on a Friday night but after 7, expect lots of people waiting. My husband and I ordered a pitcher of their berry sangria and it was a perfect compliment to sharing an appetizer sampler and a tour of Italy (highly recommended). The salad and breadsticks were great as always and our food was delicious. You simply cannot go wrong here with the friendly, family like staff.

The service was great. However for some reason there was a long wait - there always is. My main complaint was the carbonara sauce - there was practically no sausage or bacon. They need to check the recipe book I'm afraid. They gave me lots of salad and the bread sticks were good. But I was very disappointed by my main dish. Olive Garden is actually expensive - it will be a long time before I return if ever.</text>

We had a family gathering at Olive Garden in Vallejo and everything was great. There were 10 of us in the party and our server, Fatima, was very attentive,  professional and friendly.  Her hospitality skills help make the night enjoyable.
Before dinner, we all met at the bar for happy hour and the Bartender was great. We had s couple rounds and the service was quick (important when ordering drinks) and very friendly.
While the wait can seem excessive for a table, I recommend hanging out at the bar for conversation and good times until you are seated.
Good experience over all...<//Text>

Call in, take out. Our in-laws are not travelling well so for a special dinner we dropped by in the morning and set up a take out order for 5:00 pm. It was ready to go and packaged nicely and on our table warm with soup, salad, and bread sticks.  Some leftovers too when we were done. Who knew? Definitely a repeatable event for us,.<//Text>

Decided on a whim to go to this location for dinner, on a Wednesday. We had family here whom had been evacuated from Sonoma County, and wanted to have a nice dinner outing. We arrived and were told it would be a 20-25 minute wait, we waited about 10 minutes and were sat down, this had to have been around 10 minutes prior to 6PM or so, we sat, it was a busy night to our surprise but with enough staff, after we all had some time to look at the menu, we started chatting and lost track of time, to our surprise, waiters and staff walked past our table numerous times, our waiter had not came to introduce themselves nor were we brought water or bread, as I looked at the time, it was around 6:27PM, we had sat and waited close to 30 minutes, I got up, went to the hostess and asked when the waiter was going to come by as she had sat us and not a single person came to check on us, she apologized and stated she would check who our waiter assigned was, I went back to our table, waited another few minutes and yet nothing, we started talking and realized no one would come soon to take our order, as we were getting up to leave, a waitress came by and stated she’d check on our drinks, not sure what drinks she’d be referring to as she had never came by nor did anyone else for that matter to take a drink order. This has to be one of the worst experiences at this Olive Garden location. There was enough staff, but on a busy night and every table seemed to be checked on, by bussers & waiters. I’ve worked in this industry and this has to be by far a terrible experience for anyone waiting to have a dinner, especially for evacuees who are looking to have a good dinner experience away from home and not knowing what they will return to. I am disappointed as this had been a regular location of ours and to have had family from out of town have a horrible experience, it’s one to notate not to return to.</text>

<Text>Not a local resident from Vallejo but I stopped by here randomly and the outside building is very nice. I was greeted by a gentlemen and he told me to sit at the bar which was fine. I was helped by the bartender really quick.  I got the lunch special Chicken Alfredo and it was delicious! Only think I didnt like was the Passion Fruit drink it was very mineral tasting than fruity taste. Anyhow lunch hour was very casual and quiet. I would definitely come back when in town.<//Text>< pics>

<text>Unfortunately our server was very slow. The other server in the cafe was around way more. Our drinks took 25 minutes to come to our table after ordering. The server wasn't even the person who brought out our food. Basically, she took our order and filled our drinks a couple times. That's it.

Also when we were paying at the kiosk on the table, it had trouble processing our gift card so we pressed the button to call the server. Again, it took over 20 minutes for her to come to our table. We told her that it couldn't process our payment and she said oh yea I saw that, it does that sometimes. Ok, so why didn't she come to help us????

We will not be coming back.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Great service. We went on Mother's Day and it was crowded. That being said, the wait was only 15 minutes. The host William was polite and professional. Our waiter Chris was very knowledgeable on the menu and specials. The food came quickly and was delicious. I had a bit of a wait to refill my soup and salad. Except for that, we had a wonderful experience. I'll return on a nonevent day to discover if they preform at this level on a consistent basis.<//review>

Food was very good, service was not got. Once seated it took a while for the server to get to our table. Once there the server took our order and all was well. Then came the issue with the food, first the main items were brought to the table, after waiting a bit we asked for our soups and they forgot to bring them. Then we asked for ketchup and it never came. At the end we requested boxes for our leftovers and the server just left them on the table but never offered to help.</Text>

<review>Our waiter at the bar was so good friendly and had great conversation. The food was excellent as usual. The wait time was no problem because although it was busy we took the option of sitting at the bar, which was still same great service!

Whoever answer the phone on a Monday evening is very rude and unprofessional.  I was craving for pasta but this lady has ruin my Monday night dinner.  Trying to order my food for pick over the phone but the lady is rude and with an attitude and not helpful.  I love Oliver garden but after tonight my whole thing for this restaurant has change.  I will never spend a penny with this restaurant and trust me  none of my family will be going to oliver garden again.  I am a GM in a restaurant and trust me customer satifisation is our priority and they need to train this lady.  This is the location Vallejo , they need better training on their crew members.</Text>

The food was great and our server was amazing.❤❤ I would have given it 5 stars.. but the parking lot was a bit scary and someone's car got broken into while we were there. 😯 I also noticed lots of broken car glass throughout the lot from previous break-ins. The Restaurant itself was outstanding today.<//Review>

<review>We ate dinner at this Olive Garden a few days ago and the place was packed but I don’t know why. The service was absolutely terrible… We waited for 40 minutes and then decided to take a table in the bar area. We had to clean it off ourselves, wipe the table down with the used napkins from the prior people eating there, and then had to go chase someone down just to get menus. We waited another half an hour and finally our waiter showed up to take our order. Then after another long wait we got our Food but then I had to go chase down our waiter again to get silverware. Everyone’s dinner came except one and after a long wait we asked where the food was. I had ordered shrimp scampi and told them to cancel the order but he came out with it and the shrimp were still clear - in other words, half cooked!!  After an hour and a half my daughter-in-law I just paid the bill with the little kiosk sitting on the table. I then called our waiter over to show him my food was half cooked and he was going to remove that from the bill but it was too late because she had already paid. It was the worst experience of our lives.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Normally I am down for soup salad and breadsticks combo—quick and easy. Tonight I got seaweed lettuce and cold soup. The waitress seemed indifferent but got me another bowl of soup. At that point I was not as hungry as I wanted to be then 3 different bugs landed on my seaweed salad. It was that moment when I asked for the check and left. Good luck if you eat here!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Text>So... Usually, I love Olive Garden. Tonight though was just unbelieveable, after a 25min que for a table for two, I asked for an update and the table had been given away. For dinner we enjoyed an appetizer of calamari without any dipping sauce, mozzarella-less mozzarella sticks. And after opening one of these greesy cheese-less cracker shells for our waitress, she brought us another batch... These being worse than the first.  The food was so bland and the chicken so dry, it makes you realize why it's all you can eat.  No complaints about the salad :) and if it wasn't for our outstanding waitresses Ashley, we would have just walked out.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Rate>1</Rate><username>Logan Bain<//username><response>{'time': 1570984401517, 'text': 'We never want to let our guests down and it sounds like we missed the mark on your visit.

Service was okay. Ordered an app it didn't look like the photo, it was Slappy in presentation. The cheese sauce was congealed and look nasty. There was no marinara sauce underneath as stated on the menu. We requested to speak to the manager and she stated she was sorry but that's how it comes out. This was an experience that we had not experienced from Olive Garden in previous years. We have been to Olive Garden restaurants in Minnesota, Florida, and  California just to mention a few. By far this was the worst experience we've had. As I told the manager Olive Garden is much better than this. She agreed.</text>

<Text>Great place to go and eat. Just the service needs to improve and be more professional and on time and need more staff on better special occasions and slow times and busy times of better organized and flexible split shifts and better pay for employees who work hard there to.

We went on veterans day so we knew going in they would be very busy. That being said, it should not be acceptable to send out dirty plates. I ordered the mushroom ravioli and the cheese was so separated and oily I thought it had been microwaved. Apparently it sat under the heat lamp for awhile and that's what caused it. Our server was wonderful and very apologetic, she was not the one who brought us our food so she didn't know it looked the way it did.

We appreciate that olive garden supports our veterans and offers a free meal.< /text>

< Review>
We were sitted in Table 603- July 7,2019 - had a horrible service. Our sever was not so very attentive to our needs. We have to always remind her what we needed & what is not being served yet as far as what we have ordered. She gave us a supposed to be “unlimited soup and salad” with our Entree as specify in the Menu but was only given a one time- not even offered for another one or two serving and they call it “unlimited” The Soup came Cold, and normally they’ll give you cheese for the Salad and soup to sprinkle but she never asks, we had to grab it from the table from another side and do it ourselves. Had to ask for Napkins several times, our appetizer came so late & almost didn’t come had I not asked for it. Our main entree came, (before the said appetizer) and with missing, silverware in which it took a while ( i guess were suppose to eat with our hands- sorry we weren’t notified 😜) our desert came after again we had asked where was it.. basically one question- one answer portion kinda thing. My To-go had to be reminded again to her that we are actually leaving and that we are still waiting... it was just a horrible service from our waitress... and Yes I still give her a Tip inspite 🙄🙄<//Review>

The receptionist misplaced us and it took our server well over 5 minutes to locate us. After that she was quite attentive to our needs.  She gets a much higher rating.</review>

<review>So-so seafood stuffed mushrooms appetizer, too-small 'shrooms and not really suitable for sharing for the price. House salad good. Bread sticks too salty. Pasta platings ridiculously huge.
Best thing was friendly attentive service by Jonathan! ~great~ and a birthday NYcheesecake dessert with artistic plating & singing.</review>< pics>

I ordered take out.  They didn't include the cutlery as I requested.  Also no napkins.  My meal was so-so.  It was shrimp and noodles in a white sauce.  The noodles were good.  The shrimp, although there were a lot of them, were not that great.  They were quite rubbery and bland.  A dissapointment.</review>

<Review>Here we go. My one star is solely on this experience. My co worker and I arrive at 1:00p to have lunch. After we are seated our waiter comes and my co worker asks him what soups do you have? With slight attitude he says," the 4 we always have". She looks at him and explains she is asking because she doesn't know. This irritates us. We are expected to tip our waiter or waitress not just because they bring your food to you, but based on the whole dining experience that they provide. We are ready to order but he stops us from providing this to him because he is only taking our drink orders at this time. He takes really long to bring us our drinks and to take and place our order 25 minutes later all we have is our drinks. No bread, no soup, no salad. On top of that the table behind us is being served faster than us even though we arrived before them. Noticing this we get up and leave. Train this man please!</Review>< GmapID>

I don't like The Olive Garden's spaghetti and the shrimp sampler was only tolerable when that gave us marinara sauce as a dip. The two that come with it suck and they don't even have shrimp cocktail sauce for shrimp. That also sucks! The best part of the evening was the sweet young waitress and her service... Not good with names but she was cute.</text>

I had to wait for a seat at 11:30 am when the place was virtually empty.  Then they sat us directly under the AC vent where it was freezing.  To make matters worse,  the food was cold when it came to the table. Not cool.< /review>

<text>$35 for lunch and left hungry. Double order of fried ravioli and dinner portion lasagna. Soup was thin, lasagna was flat. First time at this location and last. Others must feel the same way- the place was dead at 12:30pm.</text>< Date>

<Review>Wow where to start. Should have expected this. Host was extremely short and couldn’t be bothered but to shove a couple menus at us then point at the bar. Sat there for about ten mins before we greeted by a server. Ten more mins later our drinks finally came out. Makes sense as the bartender was busy serving only her guest at the bar (and over serving one drunk slob). Food came out and was bland and frozen recently. Menu is cryptic (soup is $7.99, salad is free. Soup and salad is $13.99). And don’t play the computer trivia as it’s $1.99. It does tell you this but in small grey print under the huge “Let’s Play” sign.  Hey bread sticks are good!<//Review>< pics>

When we first got there we noticed an incredible amount personal seating customers, bus as soon as we were seated it seemed as if everyone was busy talking on their highly technological radio devices and not worried about the main reason why customers come in here, is to eat and be served in a orderly manner, we rapidly noticed all our order were taking very long to come out as if they were shorthanded, when our meals came out were cold and dry as if they were left waiting after being cooked..
Maybe so much emphasis was being put on the technology that they forgot an iPad would not bring the plates to the tables...< /review>

I have one friend that was looking for one Alfredo pasta.
Then I suggested her to go to Olive Garden.
Also I thought should be nice to try with her the Calamary appetizer...
All it was amazing.
Great flavor. Nice service. Sweet environment.< /text>

The cost doesn't make the quality or quantity... 5 raviolis for 12.99. Even with soup or salad you know you will not be full from that. Also had plastic in my chicken masala. A big piece and all she wanted to do was offer me a free meal. I'm scared to eat there.<//Review>

It wasnt bad but lots of glass all over parking lot and it took 1hr to get a table and lots of crumbs in the seat. Really disappointed with how olive gardens everywhere are going down the toilet.<//text>

The service was awesome. Tannika was our server and went way beyond great. I ordered the gluten free pasta and it was horrible. Over cooked to the point that it was more like paste than pasta. I would not order it again.</Review>

We had Kelli as a server and she was out of this world, truly a great experience. We ordered just about everything on the menu and she handled all by herself without missing a beat. I had previously bad experiences before, but this definitely topped my it and brought me back as a costumer. Not to mention the breadsticks literally can tear a family apart fighting for the last one.</Text>

I must say that the food seems to have taken a dive in quality. There are some great and poor servers but the food really drags down the quality of the experience. My last visit, I had a mousse cake that seems to have been on the freezer for quite some time and the alfredo tasted bland.<//review>

For a chain restaurant they do an outstanding job serving flavorful dishes. We arrived around 11:45 today at this location and within 15 minutes there were lines and and a waitlist and we were seated promptly and our server was really really good she was young and she had a lot of tables and a lot of people but she always made you feel that she was looking after you and taking care of you and checking on you and she wasn't annoying. Overall definitely will be back tried a new dessert today which was their ricotta cheesecake and it was excellent with strawberries< /text>

<text>Ever since the new minimum wage went to $15 some or all of these chain restaraunts have gone down hill. Olive garden for example has cut down on food cost with lower quality and less value for your money. More pasta less protein and service has even suffered with fewer employees who are stretched to the max. Making for a poor dining experience for their customers.<//text><user>104178620078021284788<//user><name>ron fowler</name>< Rating>

<Text>It was Valentine's day. I expected to wait awhile (took 1 hour). Only served 1 drink ( there were 2 of us). Ordered appetizer, it came. Waitress never took our main order (she said she was going to after we finished our appetizer). We had to find our other drink at the bar (it was never delivered). 2 hours later and still didn't even get to order our dinner. I used to love this place....now, not so much. Left and ate somewhere else. We were hungry! Disappointed.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>I am a regular at Olive Garden, it’s my go to comfort food. This was my worst customer experience ever. We came here checked in for Angie party of 3. We confirmed with the hostess that we are checked in and were told there is a 35 min wait time which we were ok with. After 35 minutes, we asked the hostess how long it’s going to be? She looked puzzled and said my party name is not there. I specifically doubled checked with the girl I checked in with, & she said she doesn’t know what happened. Not even a sad sorry. She then said talking to her fellow hostess “um I guess I’ll move them up somewhere & they will be called next”. She then just turned around. I sat down and waited. we WEREN’T called. Four other parties were called. 50 minutes went by, we flagged down a manager and explained the situation. Finally got seated. This is not ok & normally we wouldn’t mind waiting an extra minute, but the hostess’ was just rude and not even trying to explain the situation to me. I’ve worked in customer service all my life and this is not how you treat the very people that ensure you have a job. Our server was very nice and apologetic but the front 2 girl hostess either need to get written up or trained properly on how to do their job.
* * the manager actually footed our bill after we told our waiter what happened therefore kudos to the server and manager for trying to make our experience better. Thank you management and server team for paying attention to your customers***</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

If I decide not to cook dinner one evening and take my family or just a friend out to a good restaurant I will expect to be out foe at least 3 to 4 hours. If I arrive at a restaurant and the atmosphere is comfortable and the people are of standard cheer I will sit back and enjoy all of it.<//Text>< Resp>

<Review>Only because I cannot give zero. I want to appolize for coming at such a busy (1:00) time today. I realize you must be under staffed and no one was able to clear the table in the Cafe area. And once again I find myself apologizing for asking the hostess to get someone to clear the table, surely not her job. And unfortunately my friend walked out of the bathroom at the wrong time to hear the hostess and other employees talking about me and laughing. Boy! Did my friend have bad timing or what? And your over worked waitress not having time to even ask if we want drinks and when she is finally able she clearly was having a bad dad and could not even muster up a good attitude. Bad timing on my part all around.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1529112456008, 'text': "Cathianne Haracz, we're sorry to hear about your visit and we hope to learn more so we can try to help.

I am giving them 5 stars and I hate pasta!!!

We were greeted by two very friendly ladies and seated right away. I went to the restroom and it was dirty but as soon as I told the Hostess she went right to work on cleaning it up. This was the fault of a guest and the employee handled it immediately. So, I didn't minus a star.

Our Server Kelly was very personable and attentive and she always had a sense of urgency in taking care of our needs. The Manager was on the floor helping get tables served and bussed but he still found the time to come by and ask us how our dinner was. The menu choices were mostly pasta but there were a few items I could choose from that weren't. I would like to mention that they also had gluten free pasta choices. Kelly brought us salad and bread sticks quickly. I ordered the herb grilled salmon with broccoli and it was really delicious. I will have it again. Because I indulged in the bread sticks with the salad, I was able to take half of my dinner home and will have it for lunch tomorrow.

Some other things that factored into the five star rating were that every single employee that we came into contact with at the very least smiled at us. We were seated right in front of the kitchen door and the employees were going in and out of that door like crazy because the restaurant was busy. We didn't feel like we were at the kitchen door we felt like the employees were welcoming us and taking care of our needs as they were passing by our table. Kelly brought wine to the table and asked if we'd like a tasting. She also packaged our food at the table for us. The restaurant was decorated nicely and was well lit.

I work in guest service and this restaurant lacked nothing. I honestly didn't think I would give 5 stars to an Olive Garden but they deserve it. I will absolutly be a customer again!< /review>

<review>Just ok. Restaurant was uncharacteristically missing a couple of menu items like 4/5 cheese ziti, spaghetti with meat sauce, which are menu mainstays. Server didn't know they menu, wasn't attentive to our needs<//review>< gmapID>

This locations customer service and service in general has has gone from excellent to very very very POOR. As a frequent customer that orders atleast twice a month, I can report these findings. Every time I place a pick up order they:

1. Don’t give all the items ordered or components ie. breadsticks/soup/salad/drinks( happens every other order)
2. Get the order wrong(has happened with more frequency)
3. Don’t even have my order!! (This has happened multiple times)
4. Takes about 10-15 minutes to get greeted or noticed by the staff and then another 10 minutes for them to grab your order from the back(happens every time!)

I will not waste my money here anymore. My young son loves the pasta but it’s a shame that can’t get my order right. Get it together Olive Garden!< /Text>

<review>Worst service,  literally every time we have come here they have tables upon tables dirty  un bussed. And make us wait extra long time just for service.

The waiting is unbelievable for the amount of people working here we asked the waiter to buss the table and we were rudely ignored.

This restaurant really disappointed us on multiple occasions ,  its unfortunate that the servers act like there privileged and do not provide quality service.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Went here for Father's Day with my boyfriends family. They had lots of waiters & waitresses, but the service was really poor. They kept mixing up orders with other tables. Took forever to get our food, some of the soups came out after our main course. Plus, my pasta dish lacked flavor & was a bit dry. Only highlight was the very delicious Chocolate Lasagna we had for dessert. I highly recommend it, nice large piece & it was a surprising light tasting dessert that wasn't too rich!!!< /Text>

The food was terrible!!!  Service was bad! Let’s start first with that salads. We ask to add mushrooms they asked for extra charge that’s OK but why do I need to get mushrooms that set over three weeks in the freezer plus they smelling very very bad then continue with the pasta the salamon that was a overburn not like the picture didn’t went through inside of my throat that broccoli was OK.
The brad was too crispy and too oily, the Salomon bad taste definitely definitely definitely not recommended this place there is a place in US that need to be close those are the ones that need to be shut off really I don’t understand how this place getting that much of reviews you guys never never he’s good food and you should go visit Israel then you will see what is a real kitchen!
Olive Garden Vallejo you get it from you one star !!!<//text>

Worst service ever!
The server never give us napkins until we left even though we asked him for so many times.
The only time I can see my server was serving food and giving us our bill. And the server was watching me and checking to see if how much I wrote their tips on the receipt. So terrible experience! Please avoid this restaurant</Text>

Service was very slow. Some of our food as served cold and had to ask wait staff to have it re-heated.  Wait staff was courteous but I felt like they create an atmosphere of trying to rush people through their meal.< /review>

<rate>1</rate><Review>Service was slow. Had a call ahead and still ended up waiting the regular wait time of 45 mins. Got our apps before drinks not even water was served before. Our server was a sweet heart but I believe she had table on the other side of the restuarant. So we asked the food runner if they can get us a refill or cheese for our soup or salad and were told to ask our server. I was mostly discussed by the silverware. It had dried pieces of food or sauce on it and from what I'm aware of they should each be checked for water stain before rolled to serve. As for dinner two out of a table of six had to wait for our meals maybe kitchen was backed up but I wasn't happy with the quality of the food.<//Review>< pics>

Good food, ok service. Thought the service could have been way better, never had to ask for breadsticks here before when eating here & salads weren't available due to an E.Coli recall on Romaine lettuce.< /review>

I have Cealic Desease.  Had trouble getting a gluten free menu.  They finally printed a gf menu.   Waitress didn't have a clue.  When my order came it had pasta -- not gf & zucchini with bread crumbs on it.  I had not ordered either.  Another waitress heard my complaint & got my order straightened out.<//text>

the moment we walked in we noticed a foul smell, it seemed to be throughout the restaurant. furthermore service was pretty slow even though they didn't seem to be very busy. staff seemed more interested in there own drama and less intrested in there customers. maby I just showed up on a bad day but 80 bucks for two people's lunch I expect to be treated better than that.</Text>

Yes, the food may be good, but the service is bad. The front desk people put our party down as 2 instead of 6. Then promising us that we would get the next table, parties of 13 and more were going in even if they came after us. Once we got in, the waitor took forever. Saying they would "quickly grab" our drinks, they took until we were nearly done with our meals.< /review>

Horrible service on phone, mix up in online order so called to get it canceled and money not charged. Was told we had to talk to manager, we asked for his name and she would not give it to us. She told us he would have to call back. The first phone conversation ended with a hang up on there end so we called right back. It has now been over 30 minutes and no return call. This is ridiculous!! When he finally called back he did apologize for his staff which had horrible customer service skills. Note to self, never go to this Olive Garden.< /Review>

Generic Italian food but still comforting. I love their breadsticks and soups. I lived in Italy but I still have a soft spot for the olive garden. If your looking for authentic Italian looks elswhere but if you want comfort food this is the spot.</Review>

I have to think more than twice before posting this raiting. I like the place the ambience and all but, this is my second visit to this particular site.
In both ocations service was terrible. The worst was today.
We walked in around 8:50pm and the hostess told us that the waiting for a table was about 25 to 30 minutes. There was no one waiting and there were plenty of open tables. The hostess told us to go to the coffee area (bar) since they had couple of open tables there. Also, she stated that service would be the same as the restaurant area.
After we sat at a table, took about 15 minutos before someone come by to ask if we have been helped. The person said "I will be helping you, I will be right back'".
Then 10 more minutes later another guy showed up and asked us the same thing again. At that time a table was open but dishes were on it, so I asked to a guy wearing the radio and mic, if we could move from the high table into the regular one. He told us to move then he will have some one right over to clean the table.
The server brought us bread and drinks after 15 minutes and dropped them on the dirty table. Then he stated that he would come back to clean it.
After few workers went by our table they just saw but said-did nothing.
Then our server came back and told us that he was very busy so, he wouldn't be able to clean the table.
5 minutes later a lady came by and ask us if we have finished?
We explained the situation to her so she went to get a tray and helped us cleaning the table.
They told us that they had run out of cheese first, then they told us that they had run out of salad too.
There were about 3 parties on the lobby waiting for a table so I can't imagine how they would serve them. Anyway, both of my experiences were about the same so definitely I am not recommending this place at all. Their price is not cheap and they do not care about customers at all. I could of enjoyed a better meal along good service in another place.
I will not recommend this place for dinner at all. Rather pay to go across to Chevy's or Black Angus were customer service is exceptional!!!!
I should of given them zero (0) stars they really deserved it!
I hope management sees this post.</review>

<Text>We requested some fresh crushed garlic, the nice server brought some minced garlic from a jar. When asked how come the garlic is not fresh, she replied we don't use fresh garlic anymore! When we asked the manager, he confirmed and added it is a corporate decision! When we asked have you tried and noticed it is bitter. He said, yes I agree! When I wrote to corporate, they confirmed all of the above!!! This Italian eatery is just another american eatery with Italian dishes without the Italian cuisine spirit!

Terrible wait but saw the sign saying that for waiting you get 50% discount at the bar. We'd been sitting here for 20 min., the waitress never came back to take our order of beer (system on the table was not working). Went to the actual bar, nobody available or even taking care of people waiting.
Let's hope dinner is better. Very disappointed!<//Review>

Basic. They ran out of 3 deserts and didn't say so until after we tried to order them. Waitress should've said so before we ordered.</review>

<review>Service was slow. We were a party of 10 and to be seated quicker we got separated. When they sat us there was 4 empty tables next to us, the other half of our party said the same thing. We waited 40 minutes for an appetizer and more then an hour for our food. When we got our salad the waitress brought us 1 plate when there is 5 of us. The worst service I have ever gotten at an Olive Garden.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<review>The experience that I have had tonight was RIDICULOUS!! The server Anna seemed to be irritated  from the moment we walked in. She took our orders however when the food came out the food was COLD! We were Hesitate to send the food back but we did.
Once the bill came, it was a  disaster. We had a party of 4 and all of the orders were listed incorrectly. I will NEVER go back!!< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Our waitress was terrible. Spilled stuff on the table, didn't wipe it up. She wasn't very attentive and when we asked for to go containers she never brought them back. The manager ended up coming and asking if we were ready so we were falling asleep. 2nd time I've came to this place and didn't get good service.<//Review>

<review>Ok service it felt slow . I remember the last time I went to Olive garden I got to pick dressing and topping for my salad bowl they just bring it out with whatever and that's what you get with the " unlimited bread sticks" for two people they bring out three for whatever reason and take forever to get more when you ask.. even with only a few customer at location and five waiter/waitress I had to finally go up to someone for a to go box. I realise they have their sections but whatever happen to just customer service</review>< Gmap_id>

Great food! But the way they do takeout is absolutely idiotic. No one to help,never on time and they are always  confused about who is next. Some executive set up there new takeout but forgot about customer service. Idiots!< /text>

<review>This is one of 5 major restaurants in Vallejo located in the plaza drive shopping center. It's a warm cozy place and I've been several times to eat with my boyfriend but this day I went i got cold welcoming from the host that I'd never seen before so assuming she was new, she rolled her eyes up at me and directed me and my bf to a table in which she had us  turned around since she didn't know what table was availablefor us to sit at, and she was Curt to us when she  sat us down and left. Our waitress at then was refreshing so we ordered our salad, but my bf's was done wrong and after that the waitress seemed perturbed that she had to redue the order(sorry) well needless to say we didn't see our waitress until I'm assuming she felt we were completely done with our food, since she never checked on us to see if we needed refills or anything the whole hour and a half we were there. She gave us our check and scurried off once again never to be seen again. This was a very unpleasant experience because of the customer service the food was superb!< /review>< Rate>

One of the worst experiences, after a full day of filled events you'd want to have a nice dinner and relax but that is not the case. 10/13/18 in the evening we went there with a group of friends we got told that the waiting time would be 40 mins for a party of four we came it was really busy. then an hour and a half later we were called to be seated once we went and sat down the place was empty. i mean they had 6 free tables. while we were waiting to get seated they had four people at the front podium to greet people basically doing nothing for 30 mins at all. instead of helping clean the place up  and free tables they just stand there  and do nothing. we got seated and about twenty minutes later we had the server come up to get our drinks order. in general i can say this is the crappiest place i ever ate , we had the slowest server and even had people helping her, getting a drink refill was no where near the five mins range . in general we left wasting 3 hrs just to eat. worst experience ever. btw the manager knew about everything did not do squat. Id give this 0 start but that just does not seem to be an option.</Text>

<rating>3< /rating><review>Service is slow and took 10 minutes just to get my refill of water. The food is good but not great. My noodles were cold and hard and stuck together  (Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo).  The chicken parm on the Tour of Itally was a bit burnt around the edges. We were hungry and not going to complain or send it back. Maybe another day will be different and hope I do not have the same experience again< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Its good food made quickly. Love the sea food alfredo, breadsticks are always a winner. Friendly servers, hostesses. ToGo is easy online ordering. Order now or for a later pickup time/date. Its not a Michelin star restaurant obviously, but it's a guilty pleasure of mine.<//Text>

Staff was very unfriendly.  Had a big party and they acted like they were annoyed to be at work.  Food was so so.. I don't like that kids can play games without our knowledge of the 1.99 charge till the bill comes out.< /review>

Excellent customer service! I gave our server a $15 tip...he was right on target.
The bar makes a great Mai tai....and the lasagna Mia special is DEFINITELY WORTH IT!!  The salad is coldand fresh with plenty of dresseing,and the bread is warm,soft,and coated with butter(just a himt, don't get carried away with them,they are good portions)
Overall,it was very enjoyable evening out</review>

Their food got me sick and they have flies roaming around inside. Their service is ok, but it doesn’t make up for the vommiting and sickness I felt after “enjoying my meal”. I’ve been reading articles about Olive Garden, I hope they didn’t give me any diseases from their food.<//Text>

Still good place to go if one is hungry, as I was.  They still have all you can eat soup, salad and breadsticks for a reasonable price with unlimited soda's.

This O.G. is close to the freeway, other shopping (i.e. Home Depot, Best Buys, etc), plenty of parking, but the disabled parking is awkward and when we visited around 4:30 on a Saturday it was busy (45 minute wait), so to avoid waiting (because I was hungry) we went directly into what they call a "café" (bar friendly for kids) which was small and the booth seating was horrible where we had to get up and sit at the tall tables with stools.

The reason I didn't give this O.G. a 1-star (because the food was a lower quality then other O.G.'s) is because our waiter (a black gentleman) was great at customer service, very prompt, communicative and got the job done.

Although despite the waiters phenomenal customer service, I wouldn't return to this Olive Garden, nor recommend.  It needs much improvement, and a Bar needs to be a Bar, so grown-ups can have a space to enjoy an alcohol beverage (watch the ball game) away from nonsense kids.<//Text>

It's my first time to try Olive Garden again after about 5 years. The soup selection is watery and didn't like it. The main dish are good. We got chicken and shrimp carbonara and the tour of italy.</Text>

<Review>I have been to Napoli Pizza in Vallejo and Vacaville. Both are excellent as far as the variety of the menu, the quality of the food and service, and the prices. The atmosphere is modest and possibly could use some improvement.< /Review>< Time>

OMG... their prices gone up with their rebranding.  For this cost, I can go to an upscale restaurant.  Only eat there for the deals because the food is only so-so.  Don't play with the "automatic menu" on the table.  I got hit with a $3.00 charge when I was only flipping through the screen.  I didn't confirm playing any games... manager removed cost from bill.</review>

First, mango smoothie or rasberry lemonade. Then calamari and that soup with chicken and potatoes. You have to add cheese and dip the breasticks! You will thank me later. Then an order of chicken alfredo with bacon, and pesto... Amazing. I don't really do sweets, but the cheesecake with that fruit sauce is good too.😊😊👌👌</Text>

Very disappointed with the service tonight. Server didn't tell us about the buy one get one special that ends today. Salad wasn't fresh, had to send the Shrimp Alfredo back because the noodles were very gummy and clumped together. Doubt I'll go back.<//Review>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>Worst birthday celebration for my husband ever!!! It took almost 3 hrs to get fed and get out of there. They don't have vegan options on their menu so our waitress created something for us. It was noodles with canned tomatoes and broccoli, which would have been fine, except i was then charged 11.99 for the pasta, and 1.99 for 6 added toppings totalling over 20 bucks for this ridiculous excuse of a meal... way more expensive than my husband's chicken and shrimp. In the end, our bill was $120 and when i showed the manager she said she'd remove the extra charges, later to come back with a $20 gift card and no credit back.... funny that they think I'll be back to use it! Thanks olive garden for ruining his birthday!!!</Text>< pics>

I went about 3 years ago and let me tell you, it's horrible. I got some sort of shrimp pasta. First they was wrong 45 minute wait even though multiple tables were open. They gave us a basket of undercooked bread. Once we got the food not only was there a hair in the salad but our pasta was undercooked and the shrimp was frozen solid. They turned up the temperature in there and we asked them kindly to turn it down because I easily get sick from dramatic change in temperature. They did not listen and I ended up having a bit of an anxiety attack. But at the end of the day they gave us a $20 dessert gift card for Red Lobster (sister company) and our dinner was on the house.< /Text>

One of my favorite restaurants to go to in Vallejo. The decor is comfy. It can be a little chillie. The service can be hit or miss. Some servers are more knowledgeable then others. I signed up for their eclub to get discounts. Also on holidays and events it's over crowded with long waits. I would suggest you putting yourself on their waitlist, before getting there.</review>

<Review>I decided to go to olive garden for a quick birthday dinner nov 8, 2017. whenever I go to this location it is always packed, usually a 15-30 min waiting list each time so we usually sit in the bar area if its just me and my husband. so this Time its a friend and I, the wait is 20 min, so we hit the bar area cause we were hungry. So we sit down, and after ten minutes  a waitress finally comes and says have you guys been served or helped yet? {as we are sitting there with both closed menu's lol} so we order our drinks, and food at the same time. I had a few questions for my order, and no I am totally not one of those complicated a-holes who write reviews cause of one bad experience. So I ask the waitress instead of ordering the baked ziti alforno I should just order the pasta bowl with the same sauce same cheese, would make sense to do it since its a little cheaper{and no I'm not a cheap-o either, pasta bowls are unlimited though and I was hungry!} so we agree on the pasta bowl. my friend orders his food. done deal. so like 45 min goes by, mind you the restaurant was empty, so for a 20 min waitlist to begin with was kinda dumb, and the bar had 2 other booths filled with customers,and our soup and salad finally come out. 45 min later...soup that is already cooked in the back probably made 4 hours prior, cause everything Is just scoop and go(I worked at Olive Garden tracy fyi) and it was cold. salad was soggy like she put the dressing on and left it sitting for 45 min. Then the food comes out immediately after and its the wrong food. The meal I originally wanted but we decided to do the past bowl because it was unlimited. So the whole. birthday dinner was a disaster. I give this restaurant 3 stars because the food is ok there. not because this one time it was cold and the wrong order, But the food is just ok. Other Olive Garden franchises I've been to have much better food even though its all the same this restaurants  presentation, and the way they just throw stuff on the plate, and how there soups are always cold and old you can tell it just sits there. The waiters are very polite and pleasant of course. never a problem with them until this last run in there but hey, thats just one person.
the rest of the times I've been its been great. This restaurant really just needs new management to get on there cooks butts, and help organize the dining room areas a little better and I would def rate it a five star for this type of dining establishment. mind you I'm not a food critic. this is just my opinion. so take it or leave it, I'm no real food critic. just a hungry opinionative patron. good day</Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Bar service is horribly slow, and very sloppy. Don't expect to enjoy pressed coffees like espressos and cappuccinos with your zeppoli, because they CAN"T or REFUSE to make them!

Pretty tough when there is a 30 minute wait and they say how busy it is because of never ending pasta. Well if they knew they were going to be busy they should have had more people working as I see at least 8 empty tables/booths.</review>

I came to eat last night almost close to closing , my server Remo was an outstanding excelenet and he meet all our needs,  polite and apologetic, i order soup  and my kids.food came with salad minutes later he came to.apologize that because it's close to closing they were out of soup and salads. But he offer other from menu, came to our assistant in time. He just brought warmth and calmness to our nite, when we didn't get what we order. Thanks REMO, for your politeness.  I would defiantly come back and be attended by REMO. Besides that food was ok, i wanted soup and got another kind that i really wasnt  happy with it.i guess don't come in close to.closing they might not have what you want.</Text>

The food is pretty good like a typical Olive Garden but I waited so long to get a table even though they had plenty of room and I also waited very long for my food (almost 30 minutes or more) even though the rest of my party had gotten their soup within the first 15 minutes of sitting down</text>

Before you make plans to go, call and ask for waiting time.  Their kitchen is always behind 30-45 minutes.   Other then that it's ok.< /Review>

Very busy, on a Saturday at 6:30 but we found a table for 4 in the bar area. The restaurant seems to have been recently remodeled and the server was polite, despite being very busy and stretched thin.< /review>

10/16/13. Usually good but tonight I had reheated pasta, a very slow waitress that may have been overworked or new, and a manager that didn't compensate for the overworked or new waitress.< /Review>

I get my food as take out/curbside.
To be honest I get the kids pasta with five cheese marinara. The mushroom sauce is good also.  It's just the right amount of entree.  The five cheese is really good.  I do get one sausage which is extra.   For the side I get either soup [ Toscana]  or spaghetti  [ choice of sauce ]   If you sign up on their website,  OG will send you an email for a free birthday dessert.   Luckily this time of year [ Nov. BD ]  they have pumpkin cheesecake &  it  is   delish !
The chicken parmigiana is really good also.  It's enough for two or if you want leftovers.   Yummo  !!
The staff are always really nice  !!   Mangia< /text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>(Translated by Google) I was surprised that the olives in the garden salad were too salty to eat.
Overall the food was good but the server was not professional so I felt uncomfortable eating.
Not too busy and free ...

난 예전 가든샐러드속에 든 올리브가 너무짜서 먹다 놀라고 했으나 오늘은염도가 적당했다.
전반적으로 음식들이 덜짜서 좋았으나 서버가 프로페셔날하지 못해 음식 먹으면서 불편함을 느꼈다.
바쁘지도 않았고 한가했음해도...아쉽다.< /text><user_id>108169235385749384576<//user_id></record>
