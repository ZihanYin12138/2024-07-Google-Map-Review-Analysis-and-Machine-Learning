I accompanied my aunt to this location with the intent to store a few antique bureaus. Upon entering we were immediately assisted by representative Andrew. He guided us through the many choices available and necessary insurance coverages offered. Really appreciated his patience and consideration for our valuable antiques. Well done, Andrew.

The facility itself could use security, but 10/10 will be recommending to others.<//review>

We had a very nice experience, Andres made sure that we had everything we needed for our moving and storage needs. He also went over the entire contract and insurance options with us in great detail. All while he, my Husband and I shared lots of laughs. Thanks Andres for your superb customer service.< /Text>

Just rented a 10x15 storage unit and it was an overall pleasant experience.  Evelyn explained everything in detail and recommended the size unit I'd need for what I was storing.  We went to look and I agreed this would be large enough.  Even though she was waiting on someone who had made a reservation, she didn't rush me because I just stopped in.  She took her time and answered all of my questions.< /Text>

< review>
I have rented a unit here for just unde two years and I wanted to share my experience with them. I hit some rough times financially and was going to have my belongings auctioned off. I spoke with the property manager on several occasions prior to the sale in regards to retrieving my personal paperwork such  as social security card, birth certificate, tax and business paperwork, box of checks and family ashes. I was told by Patty that I couldn’t get into the locker myself but that personal items are notit to be sold and she would call me to pick up after the auction.  I had a friend attend the auction and the new owner made it clear to him that I needed to pay him if I wanted my personal information back.   When I contacted him he stated that he left all the items in the locker.     So after no call from Patty and no return of my messages I stopped in person to have  “Patty” the property manager say “nothing was left”. Shocker huh....  everyone pointed at the other.   I totally understand the auction process as it’s a business but they have no guidelines of who attends these auctions  and safeguarding sensitive items that have no value  to anyone else.  They  basically are saying they can legally traffic my personal information and items and they don’t care.  Police and legal to follow as I am not letting this go. Hopefully this helps you make a better decision then I did when selecting a provider!</review>

Brandy and Vikki are both very friendly and helpful.  They definitely provide excellent customer service, which was refreshing during my diligent search for a storage unit.  I only spoke with Vikki on the phone, but again, the excellent customer service was present.  I met Brandy in person and she was awesome!  Answered all my questions, was patient, gave suggestions, etc.

Customer service is everything in a service-based organization, and Brandy and Vikki embody best in class service.  Thanks, and I look forward to working with these two going forward.<//Review>

I have family that uses this place for storage and I often help them move things in and out when I'm in town.  I have to say that I am very impressed with Brandy and how she is always so helpful and kind to my family.  If this location wasn't so far away from my home, I'd definitely use it.  My parents couldn't be more pleased with the service.<//review>

Brandy and Vicky are the best!   Every time I have a question or a concern they take care of it right away and in the best professional way.  I have rented storage units in several places other than and from Public Storage places, and this is the best treatment I've ever received from a landlord.  Brandy is courteous and very polite.  I've rented units from this Del Amo Public Storage before and left.  Now that I needed another storage unit, I had to go back to her and rented another unit.  Both representatives at this location are very capable of assisting any future renter and I would highly recommend this location for any person who has the need to storage their personal items.  They take great care of the facilities, the security is five star and I honestly give them the top rating for their service.   Thank you for your assistance.

Recently I stopped by this location to make a payment for a friend's storage unit and I have to say Brandy is outstanding. She was polite, very helpful, and had a wonderful personality. If I lived closer to this location and needed storage myself I would definitely rent here. I highly recommend this location to anyone looking for storage at a reasonable price.</Review>

I would just like to say WOW! I've been looking at various storage facilities in the area to keep some things that I had to keep from my uncles apartment. He is in an assisted living facility and has a lot of family heirlooms and collectibles from Hawaii. This is the cleanest facility I've seen since....I guess ever. I was given a tour of the facility by the associate named Amber. She was very bubbly and sweet. She answered every question I had and assured me that I could purchase everything I would need in their own office/supply store.</text>

I have to say that I am very impressed with Brandy and how she is always so helpful and kind to my family.  If this location wasn't so far away from my home, I'd definitely use it.

We had a wonderful experience with the Torrance Public Storage. Special thanks to Breanna who was incredible friendly and helpful--she even found and applied an added discount to our rental fees without us even bringing it up.

The facility itself is great because all the spaces are on the ground floor and easy to access. It's secure and feels safe.

We highly recommend this facility.</Text>

I stopped by ps today to inquire about a storage unit and I received excellent service from Brandy, in fact her presentation was so professionally delivered that I for sure came back after a few hours and rented a unit. Thank you so much for caring and representing Public Storage in the best way!!! I most definitely feel positive about making a great start even better. Thanks Brandy!<//Review>

I had a great experience at public storage two weeks ago. I went on Monday, September 16th @ 11am ( I forgot the guy's name). The gentleman was knowledgeable and very helpful in assisting me. I especially love the drive up to the garage accessibility. Thank you for the last minute assistance.</Review>

<Review>I must say Brandy was so gracious in her efforts in getting a Large size  storage unit. She was on the job despite her Internet connection  being down. I couldnt even keep up with her she was moving so fast..
Much Love!</Review>< pics>

I'm a 43 year old woman who, frankly, is disgusted with the lack of customer service these days, which is why I was pleasantly surprised at my first, second, third and EVERY trip thereafter, I have made to PS.
BRANDY - Here is a woman every customer service employee should look up to! EVERY TIME I go into PS, there is BRANDY, smiling, polite, always wanting to help, always pleasant, always professional......
On my first day of renting, I was in a BAD mood, I was every customer service rep's nightmare. But there was BRANDY, helping me, not because it was her job, but she cared!
BRANDY alone has restored my faith in customer service. For that matter, she has restored my faith in the human race......
Thank you BRANDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<//Text>< pics>

<Review>Moving and storing property can be a difficult and frustrating process, but thanks to Brandy and Vikki, at the Del Amo Blvd. "Public Storage", the storing portion was made a lot easier.
They're helpful, knowledgable and have winning dispositions.
I would recommend this facility to anyone facing a challenging move or just need a great facility to keep their important belongings.

Gratefully,

While we were off to a rocky start with the call center consenting to features that weren't actually standard, Brandy worked with us tirelessly to make it right. Not to mention this was all done extremely last second, as we had only an hour's notice before contacting this particularly Public Storage facility. She handled the situation with extremely good nature, and fielded communication between her manager and me until we were able to reach an agreement. My team was a tough crowd to deal with on a grueling day of moving storage units, but Brandy was very helpful and polite through the whole process. To this day, she continues to go the extra mile to help us out with our storage needs. I can honestly say that, if it wasn't for her working so patiently with us, our sales team would have picked everything up and left within twenty minutes to find yet another spot. Thank you, Brandy!< /text>

< Review>
Today I found out that my storage had been broken into at Public Storage. With only having the storage for 1 month. I am disappointed in their lack of security for other peoples property by Public Storage.I also found out today that Public Storage only has ONE security camera through out that giant property and that's located only in the front! Therefore anybody even customers can come in and open up as many storages as they want to without getting caught because of NO security cameras on each aisle. Because I signed the papers saying they're not responsible for my belongings, I will have to take this as a huge loss.Today I shopped around for a new storage facility and found one with over 10 security cameras and $40 cheaper that overlooks the whole property. Good luck to all you PS users, my prayers are with you.< /Review>

11/26/16 * OMG!! Lost my lock key! Whaaaaat...it can't be cut till the 30th, all booked up ?!?! (I need to be out that day and into my bigger unit 2 buildings over)  Ok.... BREATHE! I put in a cut request and bought another lock. Silly me...all I can do is kick myself and hurry up and wait... ho hum.

At 3:18 "Raaha ringtone, pick up your phone"...it was Jeanie...she had pulled a "Genie" out of the bottle...the DM stopped by and Jeanie was kind enough to plead my case and he cut the lock and Jeanie put the new one on! Thank you Jeanie and Mr DM< /Text>

Didn't expect much going into public storage but I was instantly blown away by the genuine interaction with their employee Tynisha. She answered all my questions and I had alot of them... I will def be coming back!</Text>

In 15 minutes, they changed out the screen for the least expensive price I have found around the bay ($50)! A week after, the phone was having some other troubles and the guys took the phone apart and solved the issues without charge! I hope I won't need to come back, but should the screen become damaged, I know where I will go for a fast and reliable fix!< /Review>< Pics>

I brought an iPad in to have the shattered screen replaced. The Kemo rep was very professional, completed the work quickly (1-2 hours,) called me as soon as the work was done. And, they're prices are better than other locations I checked. I highly recommend Kemo for phone and tablet repairs.</Review>

Sam was incredible. I highly recommend Kenmo. Due to water damage to my phone, I was under the impression that my phone required a new charging module replacement in order for it to charge. Instead of charging ~$100 for parts and labor, Sam did some pre-checks and quickly cleaned the port free of charge saving me that money and time without my phone. What incredible service!<//Review>

Amazing customer service! I messaged the owner yesterday afternoon and asked for immediate assistance. He got back to me within an hour and was able to accommodate my hectic schedule. I came into his shop at about 745 and am leaving and writing this review by 808 am. My phone looks like brand new!!!<//Text>

This is an excellent phone repair shop. My girlfriend and I both took our phones in, mine for a new battery and charger cord and hers for a new screen (iPhone 6s and 7). The most impressive parts were the service,
quality of work/parts, and prices. My regular place wasn’t open and paid 50 bucks for a battery (which wasn’t even new) vs 35 for a brand new battery here. My gf said the Apple store would charge 150 vs 70 here. It took about 30 minutes for both to get fixed, coming in around 6pm.
He even replaced our screen protectors with quality ones (not the basic plastic cover) on the house.
Below are the parts of our experience that really stood out to us:
Having both worked retail, we were very happy/impressed with the high level of customer service. Audman is the guy to see, he is very knowledgeable, detail orientated, honest, cerebral, and treats people with respect and understanding. One doesn’t find customer service and quality work as good as this as often as you’d hope.
As mentioned the prices are very competitive with other repair places and better than the Apple store. The battery was new and not a replacement, where other places will replace it with a used part or charge premium for a new one.
Another high point was the honesty, I thought my charging port needed to be fixed and he checked it out and said it was fine. Many places will just tell you to get that fixed as well, especially if one thinks it needs fixing (kinda like car shops where they add on unneeded services).
They also offer a 60 day warranty for repairs (if there is an issue with the replacement part/work..though that would rarely be an issue from the quality of service). It’s always a good sign when one is willing to stand by their work and find a solution if there are any problems due to the service provided.
We are both amazed with our great experience and would highly recommend this place to anyone who needs a repair!!!
Ps. Lots of great authentic Mexican food nearby while waiting, the panderia nextdoor and taco shop down on the same side by 36th are excellent as well.<//review>

I was replacing my phone's screen and couldn't find the correct screwdriver for sale anywhere. The people at Kemo let me come by to use their tools and even gave me a hand with it. Wouldn't even take a payment when I asked. Classy people here.< /review>

Wow. I don’t normally write reviews but these guys are amazing. They quoted me $35 and 20 min for a new iPhone 6 battery. Only took them ten and i somehow lost my case in the ten minutes while they fixed it. They just gave me a new, better case free. Amazing!< /review>

About 1/2 to 1/3 of the cost at the Apple store and he had me laughing the whole time while he fixed it in front of me in just 15 minutes

I'll be referring all my friends to Steve, you don't have to live with that cracked screen and it's so quick to fix</Text>

<review>Found Kemo Wireless on Yelp for Best Place to Repair Samsung Phones. It's right near Fruitvale BART, so it's very convenient. My phone was easily fixed (I bought the LCD screen for it already) and replaced. Price was very reasonable for labor and very friendly service. Thanks Kemo Wireless!</review>< pictures>

He was very helpful and fixed my phone's camera. He also went above and beyond to get a small smudge off of my lense and my camera looks better than ever! Do your due diligence and check prices- no one is gonna beat these guys. I checked.</Text>

Kemo Wireless replaced my daughter's Motorola Moto G7 broken screen. They were friendly, professional, and responsive. They exceeded my expectations, even when there was a snafu that delayed my repair (they made it up to me without me asking). Although I hope not to have any more broken screens, I would definitely will use them again.</text>

I could not be  more pleased with my experience at this shop. He really lives up to his reputation as the best in the bay area. While in Texas, I got a hairline crack in the screen of a Samsung ATIV S Neo, for which spare parts can no longer be found. The phone was dead. The touch screen was completely unresponsive. Sprint wireless could not transfer my contacts or my texts or anything else, because they could not get into the phone. No shop in Texas could do anything. But, when I got back to Oakland, Kemo Wireless had a simple solution. They took a duplicate phone bought used for $9 off of Amazon and swapped out the motherboard. It took less than 30 minutes while I waited. And, voila! I was back in business. All my texts and contacts were there and everything worked perfectly. Kemo is a master craftsman. And, in Texas, they said it couldn't be done!!! Best of all, the shop is only steps away from the very nice, upscale Fruitvale BART station! No need to drive, find a parking space, or anything. Very convenient. There is absolutely no way this experience could have been better. Wait until those jerks in Texas hear about this!</review>

Amazing experience! A’del was excellent in customer service, information and helpfulness. I needed to unlock a new ATT iPhone so I could use it on TMobile and he did it in less than 10 minutes (once it was logged out of the old iCloud account from the previous user) for less than what everyone else is asking!!! Would def recommend to anyone in need of unlocked phones, repair or accessories 👍🏾</review>

I planned on waiting until I got home to SoCal to drink it but I had no self control. It was just too good. Now I’m sitting here wishing I had another 😩

Anyway, this place it awesome and a great spot for a beer with friends ❤️</Text>< pictures>

Just visited all 4 breweries in the Barlow and this one is by far the best. These beers are the best, hands down, compared to the others. Highly recommend coming here. The reason you see so many people here is because they are actually made to taste just that much better. Come here! You will be happy you did.<//review>

Perfect during COVID. Plenty of outside seating with space. Lots of great drink options. A little bummbed by their non alcoholic selections but it is a brewery.
They so not make food but will pick up food from surronding resturants (options on their online menu)  this means the food options are more diverse than most resturants.
Staff is always super friendly and kind, and it is always a well maintained/ clean venue. Overall great spot.< /Text>

I’ve had plenty of delicious wheat beers here and they have a beautiful venue. They allow dogs to come and hang out both inside and out. During COVID, I’m not exactly sure what their specific rules and availability are. They do have some of the best wheat beers in the area. There is also plenty of parking as they are in the Barlow. Even on the busiest nights I’ve only had to walk less than a minute from my spot.< /text>

Great spot with a bunch of outdoor seating during these Covid Times.  Plenty of beer options too!  I got the White Russian Stout and the Vanilla Bean Stout.  The Vanilla Bean was kinda meh and could have more vanilla, but the white russian was spot on and tasty as well.</text>

<Review>Great local brew house, with extensive outdoor seating... really captures the vibe of seb town. Features numerous seasonal fruit-forward brews, plus staples including a solid west coast IPA. Rotating food menu supplied by several great restaurants in the Barlow.<//Review>< gmap_id>

Went for a beer after eating at Blue Ridge(would recommend). We knew going in that we'd have to order something to eat. After taking our beer order and telling us popcorn didn't count as food we told our server we needed another minute to decide. After over 40 minutes our server comes back and we are ready to leave after our one beer. She goes to close us out and says we don't have a card on file. I tell her she never took it and that's when she tells us she takes it when we order food and that we needed to get food. If she wasn't a nice lady we would have just threw money on the table and left but we ordered the cheapest thing and told her to give it to another table. It was an infuriating experience for multiple reasons, the server not taking our food order, not checking in at all for almost an hour, forgetting that we didn't order food and virtually forcing us to buy food. In the end the beer isn't good enough to justify the poor service and ordering food from somewhere else. There are better places in the Barlow. Blue Ridge, Region, Fern bar etc.< /Review>

<date>1565735363005</date><review>This is an amazing place to have a few beers and get buzzed at. Not only that, you have a selection of amazing food to choose from. We ordered Japanese Fried Chicken and California Poke and it was absolutely delicious. The fried chicken was out of this world. We also ordered Mac and cheese from BBQ Smokehouse Bistro menu and it makes you realize you never had real Mac and cheese. The beers we had that night were: GF had Short Stack-tasted like blueberry pancakes, I had grapefruit Ibex and it was great but was getting to me real quick. Switched over to Grain and Blood and it was even more more hoppy than Grapefruit Ibex. My GF switched to silver lining but appreciated short stack more. In summary: for food order from Sushi Kosho - japenese fried chicken, California Poke, and Mac & cheese from BBQ Smokehouse Bistro. Beer recommendations: If you like hoppy stuff order: Grapefruit Ibex or Grain & Blood, if you like fruity, light, wheaty, coffee taste order: Short stack or silver lining (dark beer, tastes like literally coffee - french vanilla black coffee)</review></record></dataset><record>

Good beer with a smaller outdoor beer garden. Dog friendly and has board games. The place is pretty small so it can get packed.</Text>

Really cool place with interesting beers. Tried the Short Stack and it was amazing, tasted like blueberry pancakes. Also tried the Silver Lining, it’s darker and tastes a lot like coffee. This place has plenty of outside seating and has great ambience.< /Text>

Fun location with good beer! Pet friendly, so that’s a plus too. Try the vanilla bean stout (Silver Lining) or the session IPA (Lunch Break)  - both are delicious. Cool that they grab food from the surrounding restaurants for you too. Everyone here was super friendly. Def check this out either before or after checking out Hop Monk.< /review>

<Review>Have to drop review from a 5-star one to “not going to come back”... The sign outside says to order on their website. So i tried to do so at 3:00, and it said it would be a 30 minute wait, so I walked up and asked the girl and she said “No, it will actually only be a few minutes, that’s just an automated time thing”

So I placed the order, and lo and behold I had to wait 30 MINUTES before getting a text telling me the order was ready. And the kicker? NOBODY ELSE WAS EVEN THERE! They weren't even busy, and it still took more than 20 minutes to pour 3 cans of beer?

Meanwhile, a woman walks up in front of me, places an order IN PERSON (why wasn’t I told this was an option when I was standing at the counter asking about ordering??), and they filled her order immediately, within 2 minutes... so she placed an order 30 minutes after mine and walked out BEFORE I did.

If you can place orders at the counter, maybe don’t tell people standing right there to go on the website, and don’t lie and tell them it will only take a few minutes? (How hard would it have been, when I was asking about ordering on the website, to just say "Oh, you can order right here at the counter!")

At a price of $12-18 per 32 oz can? Disappointing, to say the least. Won’t be coming back.<//Review><rate>1< /rate>< Pictures>

<Review>Wide ranging Beer selection, including more exotic options like Blackberry, Raspberry, and even a CBD infused IPA (which is fantastic).  Nice outdoor area and bar games to boot.  They have partnerships with some of the restaurants within the Barrow so you can order from the bar and the restaurant will deliver to you.</Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< userid>

Came in for a beer, delicious beer by the way, but our server disappeared after bringing our beverages and we were left sitting with empty glasses. Had to flag another server for our tab. Also, due to covid, a meal must be purchased and the options are very expensive. A $7 beer ended up costing $30+.< /Review>

If I could give this place no stars I would. Our group of family and friends were racially discriminated. They made us wait 20 minutes before they sat us. We waited another 25 minutes before our WHITE friend had to go up and say something. While we waited for service we saw two tables with White folks get seated and served with in 5-10 minutes. We also saw another table of Latinos not getting any service. We ended up leaving, what a shame because were ready to blow hundreds on their bramble beer.</text>

Love the place - just too many IPAs for my taste  not enough other options. Might be because of SIP restrictions limiting them, though.< /Review>

I love their beer and the atmosphere. Also that they encourage bringing outside food, or order from nearby places is absolutely fantastic. But the restrooms situation with only two shared restrooms is less than ideal.<//text>

This place is great. It's both dog friendly and has great beers. My favorite was the peach cobbler. I'm a big fan of fruity beers. I also love nitro stouts but the one they had here was too bitter for me. My wife got the raspberry beer and it was also very good. Well definitely be back next time we're in the area.</Text>

We went with a huge group for a bday party. First, they have a huge variety of home brews, then they let you order in from all the nearby restaurants (as many as you like, they coordinate it and add it to your bill) and the staff and people who frequent this place are all super nice. Great patio, too.<//Review>

<Review>I love this place because it is one of the only places that I can get a buzz on with my faithful pooch. Beer tastes great, atmosphere is awesome. The outdoor patio is a great place in the summer evenings to grab a beer. It does not have the Patchouli hippie vibe which is a huge plus. Hippies are annoying!</Review>< rating>

<Review>Beer!
This is a such a fun place to stop in for a beer or two. They are very dog friendly. They do not have their own kitchen but they do have a great arrangement with local food vendors in the Barlow that they will take your order and go pick it up. Now that is service! I love the staff and the great selection of beer.<//Review>< Pictures>

In the North Bay, the breweries are a step above the rest.  Crooked Goat is easily one of the better breweries in the area.  They have a ton of different styles, and were also into making hoppy beer before it was cool.  The employees here rock, nice inside, and there are numerous activities to get involved in near by.</Text>

Great vibe and selection of beers.  Creative on the IPA scale and with fruit.  This venue is a place where locals and visitors mingle in a great venue.   Would love a sour added to the menu.</text>

<review>A micro brewery done right.  Clean, perfect atmosphere and compelling brews.  16 Taps with a range of flavors sure to produce a favorite that will bring you back... if not half a dozen favorites.  Food is available through arrangement with local establishments if your IPA just isn't enough.  The new patio space is a great addition.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Vanilla porter was on point. Smooth and not too sweet. I’d come back.

No food is prepared on-site but they do offer food from some great restaurants close by.  Just order up and it gets picked up and brought to the brewery. Seems like there is always something new on tap or "coming soon" so there is no beer rut here.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Solid beer. They don't have a kitchen but you can order from some of the surrounding restaurants. And the staff will go pick it up for you. You don't have to leave the tap room. Its pretty badass.

Pet friendly. Awesomely knowledgeable and friendly bartenders who know their business. Great place to be on a sunny afternoon.< /review>

I live very near 3 craft breweries, which I love, but at least once a week I drive all the way to Sebastopol to Crooked Goat for the beer and the experience. Lovely off kilter beers you will, once you experience them, find yourself craving. Great staff and environment. Love the wide open feeling.< /text>

Skip the session beer and go straight for those full-bodied IPAs. The Grapefruit Ibex surprised me; I don't usually go for fruited beers, but this one was scrumptious. Order tacos, sit outside, bring your dog. Love it!

Great place with great beers. They partner with local food vendors, so you can drink there and have food delivered, so you never have to leave! The beer is good, but my only complaint is sometimes they are out of standards, and I'm not a big fan of fruity, or otherwise exotically flavored beer. Their stouts, IPAs, and pales are all great though.< /Text>

What kind of brewery won't fill a growler? Very poor customer service. Drove quite a ways and they could care less. They will sell me a 32oz crowler but won't fill my own? I even offered to pay for two crowlers just to fill my 64oz growler because I use co2 to make it last.  Never coming back!< /review>

Great location for us folks biking the Joe Rodota and West County bike trails for our reward of a beer and a bite to eat. Being able to order food from the surrounding restaurants is fantastic. My only complaint is that there wasn't an unadulterated non fruit, honey or spiced refreshing beer on the list today. Last time I had a Bohemian Highway Pilsner. A Pilsner or a Kolsch after a long hot ride hits the spot. My wife had the bramble, refreshing but I'm not a fruit in beer guy. I had the "Brut IPA" which was good and interesting.< /review>

Maybe the approach of having a bartender with issues serve average brew is to keep people from staying too long and overimbibing. Thank you for doing your part to keep our roads safe!</Text>

Lots of good IPAs and lagers, though if you're looking for sours or unique beers you may want to go elsewhere<//Review>

< review>
Best part of our vacation was taking the family out ATV riding.   We had a blast and made for fun, memorable time with our son who is in the military.   The guides were awesome and very patient with some of the riders in our group that were not as experienced.  Would go back if ever in the area again.< /review>

Was in San Diego on vacation last week looking for something fun and thrilling and found these guys on google.  We're a family of five (age 51 to 19), and from very experienced to very little experience,  and these folks took care of us.  Bruce tailored the ride to our varied skill levels and everyone had a blast!  We'll definitely go back when we're in SD again.   They provided water and even followed us with a SXS in case we needed the extra help.<//review>

Kenny was very helpful and knowledgeable of his ATVs and the desert, he was friendly and easygoing the entire time, he even helped us figure out the helmet sizes for our ride! The other place in town wouldnt even let us try them on and then wanted a $1000 deposit for a rental with a bike that was worth maybe $800. I'll always go to Kenny and ATVRentals now when I visit. Did I mention the prices are a fraction of the cost at the other place? Kenny doesn't hide any bs or do hidden fees, or charge you for scratches. If I could give more than 5 stars I would<//text>

Accommodated a group of 9 riders (mostly beginners) for a whole day. Gave us a recommendation and a “follow me” to a place to eat that we could ride the ATVs to and let us return the ATVs just before closing time.

I would recommend this business to all my friends visiting this area who are looking for some really great fun on ATVs. They’re fast, handle just fine, and gave us some great memories.

Stephen at Signarama Carlsbad was outstanding to work with. He helped me to plan/install my company logo's on my truck and it turned out amazing! It was not a large or costly project, but he made me feel like a priority and he offered useful advice throughout the process. The work was done faster than expected, pricing was more than fair, and above all: it turned out better than I had expected! I highly recommend trusting Stephen and this company with any sign needs.< /Text>

<Text>I used Signarama in New York for my custom logo and tag line on my last car and had excellent service so when I bought another car, I looked up Signarama in Carlsbad. Couldn’t be happier with the end result and doing business with them was a pleasure.  I’m my experience, the individuals who franchise through Signarama are small, professional business who care about quality and their customers. I will definitely use them again, not just for my car but for other printing needs.<//Text>< user_id>

<Text>The entire process was easy breezy!  I received a quote for a graduation sign same day I called.  I placed the order and received the finished product a couple of days later.  Communication was great, work was done professionally accurately.  Would definitely do business with this location of signarama again!

We contacted Signarama to help us with branding our delivery vehicle. The process could not have been faster or easier. We showed them a design and dropped the van off for a couple of hours and it looks absolutely gorgeous. We are so happy!< /text>

Awesome pricing.  I had a special request that they visit a condominium association that I manage and they came up with a list of signs that we needed to have updated.  Now all of our signs look great.  Thanks Signarama!</text>

Signarama Carlsbad is always spot-on.  I started using them probably 10 years ago and they have never missed the mark.  Great service, great help, great work.  I now live 50+ miles away and still make the trip to Carlsbad when I need something.< /review>

We stand out in our shopping area. They are fast and reasonable with a nice variety of materials to choose from. We won’t hesitate to use them again when we need another sign or banner.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Stephen really goes the extra mile to make sure our graphics work!  He reviews overall design, file sizes, and resolution, and has saved us from disaster numerous times. Lead time is short and he keeps us informed. You should use him for all your exhibit needs!< /Review>

This review is a long time overdue.  Called around to several place and picked Signarama.  Steven and his team at Signarama Carlsbad have completed four vehicle graphic projects for our company and every time with excellent results. The workmanship is first rate and the installations all went perfectly.  It's easy to see how much care and pride goes in to their work.  They were very interested in what we needed done and were extremely helpful in getting everything into order. I'm very pleased and will rely on this company in the future. I highly recommend them!<//Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I was very happy with our experience. We had a pretty large order and needed it fast. They were very efficient and helpful and the price was right. There was one problem with one of the banners (grommets were on the wrong side) and it was too late to fix it but they refunded the entire price of the item. That is going above and beyond and I really appreciated the gesture. Great customer service. We will use them again.<//text><user>112271490876819339973<//user><date>1519787611847</date>< gmap_id>

We've been using sign o Rama for the past 9 years for all of our Reylenn company signs, banners and OSHA Compliant signage and they've been excellent to work with with very competitive pricing.

When you find a great company that always performs why go anywhere else!</Text>

I needed posters for a tennis event and got lots of help figuring out how to do it and how to mount the signs at the courts. The signs themselves gave a very professional look to the process. I would definitely use them again. (It’s impressive to see how many five-star ratings they have.)<//text>

Stephen and Jason are very experienced in the sign business and sign design. They are honest and extremely professional with integrity, something you don't find very often in any business these days. They are a business that works off of repeat customers and referrals because of their commitment to satisfying their customers needs.< /text>

I've used these guys several times for my business and they always have the best customer service--including thinking for me. I don't have time to go into a lot of detail, or spend time following up. I'm always happy when they read my mind for me and just "do it." Pricing is fair, friendly staff, and quality of service and product is right on.</Review>

I needed 11 full color banners with graphics on short notice and on a budget. Stephen understood exactly what I needed and created quality banners in record time! Helpful, friendly, fast service  and skilled. What more could you want?< /Text>

< Review>
HI have used Signarama of Carlsbad twice and really were
impressed with the product. I needed a banner for a family
event and it turned out really excellent. I had many comments
from family both old and young loved it.
Regarding some signs for my HOA, Signarama came up with
a couple of designs, for us. We review it with the HOA, and
put up the signage. Our problems have been solved, the signs
clearly informed the public that this is private property.
Thanks Signarama.</Review>

Stephen assisted me with everything from start to finish. He was friendly professional and great at communicating in a timely fashion (even through email). I have no problem referring them to others and would definitely use them in the future.

Just as a side note: I have mild OCD when it comes to things being level and even. What really sold me was when I was watching him install the decal and how much precision and care he took. I was very pleased at how even and level the final product looks on my vehicle< /Text>< Pics>

I have been going to Carl's Jr. since 1960, because for me they're the best fast food burger.  The one l had today at the intersection of El Toro and Moulton was terrible.  It started with the cashier screwing up my request for extra pickles.  I was watching while it was being made and noticed the order said 'no pickles, extra onion'.  I caught the girl who was preparing it and told her the right special request.  The first bite was terrible and it only got worse.  I was going to work so l didn't have time to take it back.  It was so bad l could only stand to eat half of it.  I had to rate this post before they would accept it.  I say minus 2 stars!!!</Text>

They need help. No napkins, bathrooms are dirty and toleit paper. The Mayor was in the parking lot yelling at people and throwing garbage at cars driving by. ( Not kidding) Not going back to this location.  Lake Forest needs to do something about their " Mayor".</text>

You spend 11 dollars on an entree. Get home its 3/4 full. I thought maybe it was a couple of times I'd give another chance. No more panda for this customer.< /text>

We always enjoy the food I bring home from Panda Express. And even though I usually pick it up & take it home with me, it's always delicious, fresh, and a good amount of food for both of us to enjoy.< /Text>

It's good to eat but not good for you. They use frozen chicken and meat. But other than that it's good.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Sometimes as tourists we crave our food. But this place is the most suitable for those who do not like hamburgers or pizzas. 2 types of white and fried rice. Many alternatives for sweet, salty and sweet and sour chicken and meat with vegetables ... Recommended and easy to locate in all California cities.

(Translated by Google) I did not like the food or what they charged me. It's ironic that they want to get rich with one's money I ordered a dish with chaomen Orange chicken and broccoli and apart honey shrimp. They charged me the combo dish + the ingredient according to them additional that were the shrimp + the shrimp that they did not give me but finally I said to the little girl who attends and said something very ridiculous. I was charging for the paper carton where the shrimp serve hahaha and then how hard it is for a chinito I took out 1 penni and they will know how to put it and then the truth and gone to other panda express better much better

I used this service from my home in Orange County to LAX and then again back from LAX upon my return.  On both trips they were on time, the car was clean and the communication was excellent.  It took me a LONG time to get out of the airport after my flight landed and the driver waited patiently with no issues.  I would use them again without a doubt.<//text>

<text>I asked the driver to stop. I didn’t know you had to schedule all stops ahead of time. He got an attitude. To top it off, he said there’s no water bottles because things don’t revolve around me because it’s Covid. Extremely unprofessional. Also he played his music the whole time and the car was hot. I should have taken an Uber.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< userid>

<review>After my regular car service closed, I found Executive Car Service. My communications are with Robert who has an amazing customer service. I wish every service I dealt with had Robert's professional service with perfection. I have never felt like I am just another customer. Robert has made me feel as though I am a VIP customer. If you do not believe me, try Executive Car Service!

Reliability: I do not need to call and make sure I am getting to my destination timely. The driver calls me as he is on his way to pick me up.

Cost: I am paying a lot less than with with my prior car service.

All I can say is I do not write reviews unless it is really exceptional and needs to be acknowledged.

THANK YOU EXECUTIVE CAR SERVICE.< /review>< Pictures>

Executive Car Service is top notch. After having been burned by early morning no show Uber drivers and terrible service from Prime Time Shuttle, I only work with Executive now for pick ups and drop offs. Booking is a snap. They confirm via text very quickly. Couldn’t be better!</text>

Great customer service, they always answered the phone and were happy to help with any question I had. Went to DisneyLand in a group and decided to get a stretch limo to accommodate 7 of us From LAX to Anaheim, and we couldn’t be happier it was with these guys. Our driver Justin was friendly and nice, car was clean and smelled good. Thank you guys for the great trip.<//Review>

I wish I'd known about this company months ago. We just used Executive Car Service for a family vacation flying out and back from LAX. After days of worrying about Uber/Lyft/LAXit or self parking, I stumbled across this company. They are the only way to go. Professional, polite, and competitively priced. Excellent experience with which to start and end our trip.<//text>

<text>We recently used Executive Car Service from Carlsbad to LAX.  It definitely started our vacation off on the right foot. The car arrived on time, was immaculate, and our driver, Mylene, was a delight. Not only did she get us there safe and sound, but she was an excellent driver as well — and I am not a good passenger!  To our delight, Mylene, picked us up a week later for our return trip to Carlsbad ... at 5:15am it was nice to see a friendly face.  We would definitely recommend Executive Car Service and look forward to booking with them again!<//text><rate>5< /rate>< userid>

Unexplained delay to airport pickup, with no contact from driver until 20 minutes after pick up time. Caused us to be 25 minutes late to a business meeting. Might as well have hailed an uber or lyft.

Edit: After bringing up issue to management the company did issue us a full refund for the trip. Management said that they are implementing new protocol to avoid such issues happening. Hopefully the professionalism of the office staff and management can be consistent through to the drivers in the future.< /review>

< Review>
We used Executive Car Service to pick us up in Costa Mesa and take us to LAX.  We also used them when we returned.  I was very impressed by the cleanliness of both vehicles, and it was apparent that the drivers enjoyed what they did.

Our first driver Mark was right on time, and got us to LAX very comfortably and was very pleasant.

Our return driver was Mylene who was also very pleasant and professional.  She was also right there when we got our luggage, so there was not any waiting around for her to show up.  We had a great ride and conversation back to Costa Mesa, and I would definitely request Mylene again to be our driver, and wish we could give her more than 5 stars!

This was the first time we have used Executive Car Service, and will definitely use them again in the future.  I particularly like that you are able to pay at the time of your trip, and to tip as you wish, without any fees being added upfront.</Review>

<Review>Use them if YOU WANT to MISS YOUR FLIGHT.

We received couple of reservation confirmation emails on May.14 from Executive Car Service (E.C.S.) for a R/T transportation between Malibu-LAX, starting on Jun.10. 12PM.

On Jun.8, I called the E.C.S. to confirm the reservation; we received a following confirmation email that the company designated a driver for the Jun.10 12pm pickup.

Our experience with other Car Service companies have been that the company made a phone call few hours before our trip followed by a confirmation call by their driver on their way to our house with an estimated approaching time, NOT this company.

Not hearing from them, at 11:50AM, I called the company, was informed that the designated driver's car was broken (without informing us); a substitute driver was on its way, about 40minutes away!
We rejected their service; tried to find a local Taxi, none available at the time, so we jumped in our car and rushed to the LAX; eventually found a parking lot with a free spot (these days, parking lots require a reservation).

Driving to LAX was very stressful because of the time strain; we would had missed our River Cruise boat if missed the flight, consequently a costly trip to reach the boat.  Thanks to the flight delay, we made it, 3 weeks parking at LAX was $385.

This is a very irresponsible company; they care less that they can cause the customer a financial or other type of harms.
AVOID THEM; they are not worth your time or your money.<//Review>< time>

Great service!  Our driver, Mo, was waiting for us when we embarked from our cruise ship in San Pedro.  He was helpful with our luggage and was very friendly.  Our ride to LAX was quick and there wasn't any traffic because this was a Sunday morning.  I can't praise this company and the driver enough for a great experience and reasonable pricing.</Review>

<Text>I had the absolute best service today from my ride from Anaheim to LAX.  My driver Robert was extremely professional, courteous and took pride in his service.  He was 15 minutes early called me to let me know and we were off and running.  He was pleasant and we had a great conversation all the way to the airport.  I would recommend him and the service highly and will be using them again in the very near future.

Thank you Robert for your exceptional and professional service today.  Thank you for having an immaculate vehicle and for your friendly service.

I hope to see you again in the near future.

Chris

First time using Executive Car Service. Sign up was straight forward and quick.  Rates are very competitive and actually cheaper than Uber in a much nicer vehicle.  Pick up was exactly on time. And my driver Mo was very personal and friendly. No issues and for sure will use again.<//Review>

< review>
The 1st driver bailed and left with any notice. The replacement driver arrived but I wanted an additional hour at the curb at lax. Also the last ride the driver said if I submitted a review I would get a $10 off on the next ride. When we got to my home the new driver had no record of this.

As a post script not only did they give me the discount but also refunded some money due to the additional wait time. Therefore updating the review. Thanks guys< /review>

Recently used them to take us to LAX, then from LAX to home. Ironically Nish was our driver and an EXCELLENT one! He was helpful, courteous and kind. On our return from an international flight, there he was, spot on, and on time looking for us in luggage claim.  This is BY FAR the BEST car service and service by Nish we have ever had. We will request him by name the next time we use this EXCELLENT car service. Worth every penny for their excellent customer service! Thank you Nish, you were AWESOME!!!<//review>

The woman who helped me was INCREDIBLE! So sad I didn't think to catch her name :( She was so knowledgeable and helpful. When she saw me looking at vibrators she asked me what I liked, let me see the product and test the vibrations when I told her my preference. She took the time to really listen to what I wanted and guided me. She didn't try to upsell the most expensive product either, which was awesome. She hand picked some samples of lube for me to try out and helped me with lingerie sizing. I can't wait to go back soon! Would highly suggest visiting.</Review><Time>1612934016533</Time><user_id>117004874852466662190< /user_id>< Pictures>

<text>I mean what can a girl ask for. Local and woman owned. My favorite place to get comfy PJs. I am 5'11 and a size 12/14.  During the covid pandemic I called over the phone gave my size and sight unseen purchased three sets of PJs for my birthday. They all fit perfectly!  They even wrapped them up because it was my birthday.  Great local shop with a great selection of both cozy and sexy. Do no hesitate to phone shop or in person shop.  Either way you will get a great experience. Ask for Nikki if you can. She is a gem.< /text>< GmapID>

<review>I love this place! The staff are always super helpful and friendly. During the COVID crisis, they really went above and beyond with customer service - I got super spoiled being able to shop via social media and pick up my purchase curbside. And when I wanted to buy a pair of PJs to give as a gift, they went above and beyond to find some that fit the criteria I gave them. Humboldt's really lucky to have a store like this!< /review>< pics>

Good place to look around. Definitely not an intimidating place. They had a nice selection but since of their toys were not made of the best materials so  I would watch for that.
They did not have a huge selection of whips which is what I was there for. They were a little over priced for the quality.
Their lingerie was very pretty though!
And they seemed super friendly too< /text>

< review>
Buyer beware!! They are only interested in your money not in making you look good. It took me a while to find a corset I liked, most of them there look costume and un-sexy. I went to try it on and the lady took 20 mins to come help me with it after she had asked if I needed help. When I was trying it on, it looked too big on me but the sales lady said it would fit fine once I tied it all the way up. I asked her too but she just pulled it a tight with her hands not cinched it up. I took it home even though I wasn't sure. I tied it up all the way and put the top on. It was way too big as I suspected. I went to take it back and they refused to give me back my money. It wasn't because I had tried it on at home either. They would let me have in store credit but not a full refund even though they had nothing there that I liked that was in my size.<//review>

<Text>Usually very nice place with kind employees that let you alone to look at private items but remind you enough, one time, that they can help you if you need any. Although, if you are a young man with a black jacket on and gauges and acne and you are like a lot of people who dont want someone around yoy when you discuss your sexual proclivities with your boyfriend??? I guess you should be wary because someone here, one person in my experience, will believe so much that you are going to steal something to the point of asking repeatedly if you need help, and will then hover around you. Its obvious behavior, especially if you have visited this place as often as I have and have been left alone literally every other time. While I understand that the location of this establisment can create a suspicion for, generally, men, but I do not understand how I looked like a 1. homeless person, 2. drug addict, 3. exhibiting suspicious behavior in any way and those are the only circumstances that would lead me to believe that the employee would be suspicious of me. I haven't returned since, but if your a "normal" looking person, you shouldn't have any problems and there are a decent amount of toys to choose from, although there are about two nonvibrating dildos, that are "normal," smaller than massive, to choose from but about 15 different rabbit vibrators. When it comes to sex toys, not a lot of other places around offer any, but still this selection is a bit bare when it comes to offering the simple pleasures of a simple little Willy.</Text>< Date>

i walked in here tired of going to victorias secret telling them my bra is to small and they tell me to change the bandsize (because they have nothing bigger than dd and wanted my money) so after buying more that still didnt fit right i went to good relations. i walked in and told the staff what i needed and why. in five minutes she pulled out a nice selections of bras meeting what i was looking fore. NEVER before has bra shopping only taken me 15 minutes. i love love LOVE this store. from the helpful staff, good prices to wide array of sizes this place is awesome. looks like victorias secret lost a customer and good relations gained one. i am very pleased with my purchase wich would have cost me double at victorias secret and they had super cute styles which V.S. never does so it was really nice to feel acomidated.<//text>

<Text>We had a excellent experience! I want to  thank Joseph Gonzalez for helping my husband for a Chevy Tahoe come true. He was very helpful, attentive and trustworthy. This was a smooth process from the beginning to end. He answer all the questions and concern that we had. If you need to buy a car I would recommend Approved Auto Center of Lodi and ask for Joseph Gonzalez as your salesman.  Thank you again Joseph!!</Text><resp>None< /resp><Rating>5</Rating>< GmapID>

I honestly didn't think I could be approved Alex got it done very fast.
Alex was very nice and got me into the vehicle I wanted. The easiest most less stressful car buying experience I have ever gone through. I would recommend everyone to go buy your car from Alex at Approved Auto Center.
Thanks Alex<//review>

<Text>How can I express the gratitude for this car company enough? Not only were they amazing and helped my son get a car solely in his name, with affordable payments and warranty…but they also took care of him well after the purchase! They honored (even though it wasn’t in writing) making a second key, which ain’t cheap for the type of car he bought, detailed it to sparkling new status, and even paid for the smog and new brakes and rotors. We bought it as is but they proved that the safety and happiness of their customer was worth absorbing some cost for my new car owner son! We cannot thank you guys enough for the amazing service from start to finish. Highly recommend going here first when you need a car!</Text><Rate>5< /Rate><Pics>None</Pics><username>Cari Ruotolo<//username><response>None< /response></record>

<Text>I have nothing but great things to say about this business! I was in the market to buy a car ASAP I left and an email and Joe responded very quickly and i went in the next day! Was very professional and answered the million questions I had! He worked with me in finding something that worked for me and every step along the way! I couldn’t be happier and am so excited for my new car! If you ever go there ask for Joe he will help you and go above and beyond!!</Text></record>

Found a ad on offer up and got in contact with Joe. I told him i had no credit and he said that’s no problem. He helped me get the car I wanted that same day.  Very respectful and professional, they have pretty nice cars that are affordable too. I would definitely recommend you ask for joe, he didn’t let me down.< /text>

<Text>We purchased vehicles from Approved Auto before with no issues, but in September we purchased a Ford for our daughter and the plate and tags never came in from DMV (expires in December) and when I contacted them to find out why, was informed they are having problems with obtaining clear title (their end) and they never contacted me to even let me know. Tried calling today (as time is running out for vehicle to be street legal and we are still making payments and was told only person that knows anything about this is out until Monday?!?  Have to say I am very disappointed in this whole experience thus far and unless made right, would recommend people inquire if here are title issues prior to purchasing to avoid what our family is currently going through.</Text>< Rate>

I was interested in one of their cars and contact a guy there name Abraham Pompa over there and ask for car-fax report of the car because I live in sac area which is an hour drive, he said ok but never send, after 3 days I sent a reminder email which he didn’t even answered. Seems they don’t care their business so I bought from some where else.< /text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>I would not recommend this place to an enemy. Besides the over priced cars and high interest rates. They are not honest. Watch out for a shut off device.  They install it, telling you it's a theft device, when it really to shut off your car if you dont make payments on time. So you can get stuck in the middle of nowhere. How they sleep at night? No worries, it's easy to remove. Do it b4 they shut off your car. Do not get your financing thru credit acceptance.  They will NOT work with you on anything. Horrible!!!!

Traded in my 2010 Chrysler 300 for a 2013 one. I was very pleasantly surprised by the ease of the whole experience! I wanted to switch out my tires and rims for the ones for the ones on the new car and they were very accommodating, they worked with my schedule and I go back on Saturday morning and have that done at their local tire shop. Everyone was very personable yet professional. I am located near Loomis and work in Applegate, so it was a bit of a drive. I wanted to be sure it was a done deal before I drove to Lodi from Applegate and they did everything via email, phone and text! I worked with Arlinda, Brandon and Sam as well as the finance manager (sorry, I forgot his name) but it was hassle, haggle free!<//text>

Honest, very helpful, not pushy, work with you, give you plenty of time to decide, gave a break on the price and allowed me to have the vehicle inspected by an outside mechanic prior to purchase. They took the time to explain some things about cars and used cars that was helpful and useful. Nice guys especially Sam my salesman and John the owner. Did not use the typical high pressure sales tactics most used car sales man use. They were respectful and listened to what i wanted, never trying to get me to buy something else. It was a very nice interaction not the pitched sales gimmicky high pressure monologue  you usually get on new or used car lots.</text>

<Review>Everyone was nice until my brother decided he wanted to think about the car that they wanted to sell him. The car had fluids (oil probably)  in several spots in the engine compartment, bad tires, smelled like smoke and looked like it had more wear than the mileage reflected. When we walked out, the salesman, Esteban told him that they were going to ruin his credit and primised that he would never be able to buy a car in the valley if he said no. Now he has 4 more inquiries on his credit and has to fight with the credit bureaus to get it taken off. Esteban, actually thought that threatening him would make him buy the car. 😡😡Bad move... My truck has a dash cam and we caught him saying half of it!!!😂😂😂< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Don't buy anything from this place, they don't inspect their vehicles very well, and the extended Warranty they offer is useless don't waste your money or time. They are very good at blowing smoke up your azz . The truck we bought has had nothing but issues and the extended Warranty doesn't cover the problem. So Unfortunately we're stuck with  a lemon.< /review>

<Review>Called to look at vehicle. Spoke with Andre. Asked if prices were negotiable, he asked if I had cash, replied that I did so he stated yes. Drove 40min there and the first thing Andre said was, "Cash doesn't mean nothing to me." Very rude guy. Wasted my time, and gas.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

< review>
Only putting one star because putting ZERO isn't an option. My great-grandfather who is 84 asked me to please post this and let people who live in Stockton &surrounding areas know of his situation, so that they might not have to go through the same thing that he did. He feels taken advantage of and wants to share this.... (The following in parenthesis  are all his words)

"Beware - Warning
If you are looking to buy a used vehicle stay far, far away from Approved Auto Center 1130 S. Cherokee Lane in Lodi, CA. Why? Because once you drive off the lot, and within the next day or so you find there are mechanical problems that obviously pre-existed, even though the salesman told me that they performed a 200 point inspection and the car passed everything and is good condition.
Don't bother to call the lot to explain/complain. I called to complain of these obvious conditions and the help I got from them was 'Well its YOUR car' twice and then they hung up on me. The cost to repair the car is in excess of $2,100 and that's after putting $2,000 down, and all the help I can get is 'Its your car'.
Hopefully, nobody will fall into their same trap that I did. NO STARS OUT OF 5! Thank you."

If you have read this far I want to say thank you for your time and consideration. Also wanted to add a few things myself. My great-grandfather  is a good, God fearing and extremely compassionate man who would help anyone who asks him. He is a retired police chief who served 20 years of Law Enforcement in Manteca, Stockton, Roseville &Auburn. He was treated so poorly by this establishment that my heart hurts for him. All the good he has done in this world, and in his later years is being treated unfair this way, it's just not right. Just a mere few days of utilizing his vehicle and after being looked at by Big Valley Ford, he was made aware that his car possessed broken motor mounts and needs a new transmission clutch. Please just keep this in mind if you were thinking of taking a visit to Approved Auto Center in Lodi.< /review>

Me and my wife went to this dealership and with both of us having bad credit the team and managment here was able to find us the car we both love and with low monthy payments. The staff here are very professional and work hard to make sure you satified to the fullest. We highly recomend approved auto center of lodi for your next dream car.<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>If I could give them 10 star I would. The whole team is really amazing 😊 But Nate and John is  phenomenal. I was really  leery  about going down there cause I didn't want to be turned by another car lot who promise things they can't come through on but these guys worked on it before I came down. Also i lived in Sacramento and this car lot is in Lodi, I didn't have a car to get down there and it cost to much to get down there as well. So guess what they got me a freaking Uber, although the Uber driver was freaking crazy. Which I hope they gave his ass .5 star but thats a different story lol. Back to what I was saying, when I did I arrive I had a freaking charger within low miles waiting on me☺️☺️☺️😊😊😊 All I had to do was sign on the dotted lines. They were very professional but still true to them selfs. Super young bunch of guys, with high energy to keep you entertained during the buying process. Also after all that I had to get car insurance, guess who paid my down payment for my care insurance......John discover card lol 😄😄😄😄 I was so freaking grateful. I had tried everywhere else like Paul Blanco which my car salesman there Rick sucks lol. I also tried Justbettercars which also sucked customer service side at least. Approved Auto Center is like the Super Hero’s of the industry. They are the Avengers , I wish batman was an Avenger😩 But anyways John is Thor and Nate Is Hawkeyes cause less face it those are my favorite ones. But all the guys are  extraordinary. They need a place like that everywhere with people like that, who are understanding☺️ P.S don't make fake paycheck stubs that are  noticeably fake put some effort in it or just be honest and say I'm a stripper or a drug dealer who has tons of money in a  Industry that don't provide paycheck stubs😹😹😹😹 well I'm out of here✌🏾 Get your car from them.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<text>They start out super nice and do everything they can to help you and get you approved.  But in my experience once I had the vehicle at home they didn't care about me at all.  The day after I bought my truck from them I noticed a huge gash in one of the tires ( I looked them over at the car lot but the gash must've been on the bottom)    they refused to fix it. The sales manager jus kept brushing it off like it was no big deal ( it's a 35" off road tire and he doesn't want to spend that money to fix it)  I had the truck taken to multiple tires places and they all said it was a safety issue.     So unfortunately I let that go      then after waiting almost went months for my new tags to come in I receive the registration renewal in the mail.    Apparently they didn't finance that part in with my loan.   Without telling me.    Once again sales Manger brushes it off says there's nothing he can do cuz it's up to the dmv.   I called the dmv and they say he's lying.   Bottom line is they will help you buy a car but make sure you check the car extremely well before you the lot and make sure you understand everything they tell you that your signing.  John is a real unreasonable guy<//text>< pics>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>First of all I am very displeased with this business. My car had broken down in Lodi. They offered me 250 for a 2002 Nissan Maxima se for trade in value. Right away I could tell these salesmen were shady. They saw I was in a jam so they capitalized. I bought a Dodge Charger with 4500 down. As I was on the way back to Bay Area  I  noticed something wasn't right with the front end, also the automatic transmission was not changing gears to smooth. I immediately called John and explained to him what was going on . His very smart answer was well have you driven a charger before? So turns out after taking it to dodge that it had been crashed and not disclosed to me. Red flag .
Ultimately I took it back got into a Nissan Altima. Which had been crashed as well. Shady people . I sent in my payment and the bank said they never got it more bs from everyone involved with this horrible business. Second payment wasn't even late and they repoed the car. So now I'm out 4500 plus the payment because the receipt was in the car and they wouldn't. Let me back in it. Super bummed. Basically it has cost me so much . Knever everyone go to that horrible business. I, in the middle of a battle for ,y money back and I plan on suing.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Joe was awesome! It was my first time ever purchasing a car from a dealership. I actually went there just for information 😆 I didn’t think it was going to be that easy. I had a few things that were a must and all the boxes got ✅✅✅ you hear stories all the time about car places taking advantage of people (specially women) but Joe was Patient with me as I had to keep calling my husband back to discuss things. He made sure I was comfortable with every decision I made. I love my 🚙! I will definitely be sending people his way. Great Job Joe 👍< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I bought my jeep compas 2016 last year and until today it suffered a transmission problem and they solved it at no cost since ORLando arrived, the new manager improved that business 👍

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>We needed the rooftop  HVAC unit  and duct system inspected and problems diagnosed. Everyone who assisted us was professional, helpful and pleasant.

Response was very timely and tech, Jose Rivera, called to let us know that he was on his way. He arrived during time frame given by the great scheduler, Ben.

Tech, Jose, was masked and followed strict Covid 19 protocol.

He did a very thorough inspection, was kind enough to take pictures and send them to my email , and explained everything well.

The price for the inspection was very fair.

My partner and I were very pleased with the service from Canoga Park Heating and Air and rate them 5 stars.< /review>< pics>

We just had a routine heating and air conditioning maintenance visit with Johnny. He came with the appropriate PPE and did a thorough job checking our system. Johnny is very knowledgeable, detailed and patient. He always takes the time to explain everything and answer any questions we may have regarding our large systems. We highly recommend Johnny and all of the Canoga Park HVAC team. The Canoga Park office staff, technicians, install teams, really every person we have worked with has always been professional, knowledgeable, kind, and nice! The world would be a happier more peaceful place if there were more people like the Canoga Park team!< /text>

We have been using Canoga Park Heating and Air Conditioning since 2013 for routine service and repairs. We have old units (1979 and 1986) and they've had no issue fixing them for us. We had Dave out today to give us an estimate on a new air conditioner and furnace. He was on-time, professional and the price was fair. We highly recommend Dave and this company.

After getting quotes from 3 different HVAC companies, we decided to contract with Dave at CPHAC for new Carrier furnace and AC equipment. We are very happy with the work done. Dave was super quick on getting back to us on questions we had both before and after the job was done.<//text>

I am surprised by all the wonderful reviews. We had them come out to check out our unit that was not working. When they completed inspection they said we would need repairs and refrigerant that would cost us $2500+. We we're close to pulling the trigger but decided to get a 2nd opinion. We had another company come out to check the same unit and they questioned if someone had been on the roof already because the power switch was turned off, the caps were missing and apparently they disconnected some wiring to a different unit. These guys tried to come and sabotage us for more money. We did need more of the refrigerant but we did not need any repairs or replacement parts. They probably thought we wouldn't have found out but I am so glad I got a 2nd opinion because these guys tried to screw us!<//Text>

<Response>{'time': 1611844849075, 'text': 'Hello Mr. Garcia. Thank you for your feedback but some clarification is needed. As it was it explained to you, two units were checked and the estimate given was to repair both units in your commercial space. The technician left everything as found until proper approval was given, nothing was sabotaged. It is very easy for another company to put a bad name on any previous contractor trying to impress customers to get the job. The technician did leave the switch off as the unit was not working properly to prevent further damage to your system. It is disappointing to see this review after it was fully explained and seemed to agree.'}</Response><gmapID>0x80c29c130a13496d:0x47ed47c9f3625480< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Johnny really helped us out. We were dealing with from our home warranty company putting off completing this job for 6 weeks!  Johnny came out, diagnosed the problem quickly, and was very helpful in giving us the information we needed to submit for reimbursement from the home warranty company. When he returned to actually fix our furnace, he did the job in less than an hour, had all the parts, and was very professional and courteous. 6 weeks of waiting was resolved in less than 2 hours thanks to this company!< /Text>< pictures>

Canoga Park Heating and Air is fantastic!  I have a regular service contract with them for my home and my rental property and they're always total pros!  Service tech Kevin has been servicing our systems and he's super knowledgeable and helpful.  We've had two major A/C systems installed by them at two different properties in the past few years and we're thrilled with them.  They know their stuff!  Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go sit in my perfectly-cooled 75-degree living room while the rest of the city swelters and sweats.<//text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>I cannot say enough good things about Bob and his team. Bob was amazing at answering all our questions (and there were a lot).  He was patient and friendly and actually loved the questions and being able to help us get what we needed out of our system.  The installation was seamless, the team was clean with the work they did and didn't leave any kind of mess behind.  I had to delay the fire-up of the system a couple times due to other work being done in the house and Bob and his team were extremely flexible.  I am a tough customer and communication is very important to me.  Bob did not disappoint, his emails and phone calls were right on point.  Our household expect the experts to know their work and we research and check-up on everything we're told.  CPHAC was there 100% with every answer and accommodating every need.  If you want an amazing experience, simply call Bob.  He will get it done!<//Review><gmap_id>0x80c29c130a13496d:0x47ed47c9f3625480</gmap_id><pics>None</pics><Name>Steve Berkowitz< /Name></record></dataset><record>

Craig came by to advise me on a new condenser, etc. to replace my current 23 year-old air conditioner. I had a couple of concerns which he addressed and then promised me a quote within 10-15 minutes which I received. Very happy with the service!<//review>

<text>Extraordinarily responsive when my elderly mother lost her a/c during a possibly life threatening heat wave in S. CA.  Came the same day to attempt to repair a 15 year-old unit, and were able to schedule a quote and next-day scheduled replacement on an emergency basis.  And...it was a very fair fixed price for everything.  They even provided a portable a/c loaner for her and set it up.  Kudos to Grace and Craig!< /text>< pictures>

<text>Canoga Park AC installed my air scrubber during the Porter Ranch methane leak.
Greg replaced the UV light for the scrubber and did my fall heating system check up.  He was on time, wore a mask, and efficiently completed my service.

<Review>So far, I got a decent estimate for duct replacement. Waiting to finalize estimate and schedule the job! Duct work was reasonably good.  However,  it took several calls and visits to straighten out a compressed duct in order for it to work correctly.
Technician came same day for heater problem and adjusted the unit so it was able to work again.<//Review>< pics>

I purchased my HVAC system from Canoga Park heating and A/C a while ago and they have kept it running perfectly for many years. Of course, after over ten years of no problems, my A/C decided to have a system malfunction, at night, while the weather reports were predicting 100 plus temperatures in two days. I called Canoga Park Heating and A/C in the morning and to my surprise, not only could they come that day, but they would be there by 1pm. We followed their app, knew who was coming and could tell  how far away Kevin was and when he arrived at the house... so we could mask up!  Kevin quickly found the problem, told me the approx. cost, but said it required  parts that might not be in stock. He asked for a minute to check and came back to tell me, not only were the parts in the warehouse, but they were less expensive than he thought. YAY! Then he told me he could pick up the parts first thing in the morning, but had to check the schedule and I should call, if I hadn't heard back by 3pm. I am so sorry I don't remember the name of the woman I spoke to, because she was wonderful. She put me on hold while  she checked with Kevin, and came back to tell me he would be here between 8-8:30am. I was  beyond grateful. Kevin, our super hero,  arrived the next morning, fixed the system in record time and just as the temperature started to rise outside.....The temperature  inside was coming down. I would say that this was the most stress free emergency service I've ever experienced. I have appreciated this company and their regular service for many years, but now I have a whole new appreciation for the service they provide and the wonderful people who make it happen.< /Text>

Jose, was an excellent technician... He solved my problem in a matter of minutes, and now I can rest assured knowing my AC will last through these hot summer days to come and will filter out the polluted air from these fires.
5+++ Stars!
Thank you!< /review>

It's nice to know that I'm in good hands. Technician was able to come early but called to make sure that was ok. Checked things over and all was good in the attic but needed to replace a relay on the compressor. He had one on the truck and did the job quickly. Thank you!</Review>

To begin Craig is not On the list to give a review for. Told him how to get on the roof and after just 10 minutes he came back and said he was ready to show me the quote. I know that he never went on the roof and lied. After I said that other companies said that a 2 ton would be more than enough he said he would not take the job if that’s what I wanted. What company turns down work like that. I asked him about the intake and out take being to small for a 2.5 or 3 ton he said that it does not matter. He seemed to not want this job and did not care at all about anything I would say. I will not call them back.<//Review>

Kevin found the problem with our A/C in minutes. He explained the options we had for repairs, and they had the parts for our 2007-vintage system on the truck.

We asked some not-on-the-order questions about our system (duct/flow issues) and he didn't hesitate to climb in the attic to take a look. Unlike other places we've talked to in the past, there was no pressure to do things that did not need to be done.

Professional, can-do attitude and got results. Highly recommended.< /Text>

Overall we are very happy with the service we received from Canoga Park. They installed an entire new HVAC system to replace our non-functioning evaporative cooler and old furnace.
When Dave came out to give us the estimate he was extremely knowledgable and understood what we were looking for. He was able to get us a great system without taking us over our budget.
Throughout the install the team was very respectful and covid conscious. They cleaned up after themselves before leaving each day.
Even after the install was finished, when we had concerns about some leftover ductwork, Dave came right out to take a look and fixed it on the spot.
Would definitely recommend Canoga Park Air Conditioning!< /Text>

For once, I felt the technician was focusing on finding the problem instead of confusing the customer with different issues to complicate matters.  Kevin found the problem, unplugged the main A/C drain pipe from the bathroom plumbing and redirected it into a bucket under the basin.  Unfortunately, he couldn't quite explain the wet in the wall.
Although I still need to call a plumber to complete the task and find the cause root of the damp in the wall, I am satisfied with his work.
One improvement, the company did tell me about the $85 call out charge which only goes towards parts and I since didn't have any parts needed changing, I lost there.. The company did not tell me about $120 hourly rate either. Overall, you can put your trust in the company.<//Review>

Thank you again Rosa."}<//resp><text>Jose Bolanos was the service man that came to my house. He was on time friendly and highly knowledgeable in his field.
He took his time working through his lunch to make sure both my heating units were serviced according to my needs. He Cleaned the filters, he made sure  there’s no gas leakage, and added Freon to the unit. He also installed a Nest thermostat for each unit so I can control the temperature from my IPhone.  Thanks to him I don’t need to replace my units. From now on I will use Canoga Park Heating & Air.  👍

Thank you Jose, you did an amazing job!😊<//text>< Date>

May 5th, 2021 Jose Rivera is GREAT!
Such a nice guy! He was on time and so courteous and Covid safe. He came in, accessed the filter and lines and main unit. He gave us a complete run-down on everything and replaced the filter and cleaned up and set us up for a payment schedule and was done in about 30 minutes. Such a pleasure to have him here today.

9/25/20 Kevin Castro came today to search for the smell we keep smelling coming from the AC. He did a thorough inspection and did not locate any problem. He was on time, with a mask and so nice. He told us about another service that can be done to eliminate contaminates in the air and we will be looking into it and may have them come back to set this up for us. We were really happy with our service, again, today.

Allan just came for another filter replacement and unit check. Everything went well. He was in and out in no time and wore a mask the whole time. Always a good experience. Thank you!

Last time: Allan was just here to replace our AC filter and do a check up on our unit. He was on time and thorough in checking everything out. Gave us some great info as well. Great experience! Thank you.< /Review>

Canogas Heating & Air's Bob Wiseman was patient & professional in assessing my needs and presenting his proposal. Bob answered all my questions clearly. I used his company for another installation 18 years ago, and I look forward to getting a brand new 5 ton package unit. Had an issue with my old house wiring, and they went out of their way to solve the issue quickly and professionally!</review>

Kevin as usual was very professional and knowledgeable! Came on time finished job in a timely manner and is very courteous.

They are a great company; you MIGHT find cheaper but you won’t find better especially for the prices which are fair and in my experience NEVER include hidden costs or unnecessary repairs.  On time, on budget and super easy to work with.</review>

Bob Wiseman and his team including Kevin, Jorge & Salvatore were all very easy to work with and the job was completed quickly.  Knowing that the split unit has a 10-year warranty & I can rely on Canoga Park Heating and Air Conditioning to fix any potential issues down the road gives me peace of mind.</text>

I have had them over the years service my heating and A/C.  Dave came out to give me a bid to put in dual heating and A/C.  He was so informative, professional and knowledgeable.  I love the job they did.  They were clean, fast and so accommodating.  One year later now I had an issue and they came out...no questions asked and fixed the issue at no cost to me.  No arguing but just a friendly attitude and Bob said “We need to get a team out immediately”  which they did.  And the issue had nothing to do the the dual heating or A/C.  Johnny came out and .  I highly recommend them!<//text>

Got a quote and was extremely relieved that they said I didn't have to replace EVERYTHING (which all other quotes I got said I had to do). I will save more than half the cost by just replacing what they verified has gone bad, and can save the rest of the system for a future repair. I appreciate this kind of honesty and it makes me want to do business with a company like this.<//text>

We have relatively new Lennox units and have been remodeling so needed one hooked back up and needed some duct work tweaked on the other.  Dave was on time, courteous, incredibly knowledgeable and honest.  He spent time getting up to speed on what we needed and absolutely acted in my best interest when he told me that while he'd love to have our business, we would be better reaching out to our original Lennox dealer.  He then offered possible solutions for our duct work.  I tried to pay for a service call and he simply said the visit was complementary and that their philosophy is not "a customer for the day", it's "a customer for life". I  am sad we aren't able to work with Dave and Canoga Park Heating & A/C. I highly recommend them!

After their technician Johnny came in and diagnosed the problem with my heating system, he suggested to replace the circuit pump. Few weeks later the part came in and he replaced it but there was still no hot air! Then he said the problem is with the water valves and I need to call a plumber to fix it. And still demanded me to pay $1200 for a service that has not fixed my problem. How unprofessional is this? I spoke to Ben in their office today and shamelessly he too wanted me to pay this amount!

I do not recommend anyone to use this company.<//Text>

Dave appeared on time and was appropriately dressed post COVID-19.

Walked me through all options.

Great ability to put things on the schedule quickly.

Smart and understands the needs of replacing the HVAC and ductwork. Competitive price.<//review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>This was our first experience with Canoga Park Heating & Air Conditioning.  We have relatively new Lennox units and have been remodeling so needed one hooked back up and needed some duct work tweaked on the other.  Dave was on time, courteous, incredibly knowledgeable and honest.  He spent time getting up to speed on what we needed and absolutely acted in my best interest when he told me that while he'd love to have our business, we would be better reaching out to our original Lennox dealer.  He then offered possible solutions for our duct work.  I tried to pay for a service call and he simply said the visit was complementary and that their philosophy is not "a customer for the day", it's "a customer for life". I  am sad we aren't able to work with Dave and Canoga Park Heating & A/C. I highly recommend them!  In addition to Dave's amazingness, the company texts reminders and alerts when the technician is on his way. They include a photo of who's coming as well.  A top notch company!  Thank you, Canoga Park Heating & Air Conditioning!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

< Review>
I continue to use Canoga Park Heating and Air Conditioning.  I own properties in California and Arizona where because of the locations I use other AC companies.  Canoga Park Air continues to offer the better quality and service.  Most recently CP Air installed a new 4 ton unit in Simi Valley.  The installation was done as promised.  The technicians used all the Covid safety precautions we hoped for as we are in the high risk category. The system works great.   I recommend this company without hesitation.</Review>

Jose Bolanos was here to install our new NEST thermostat. He is super knowledgeable and friendly, and made sure that we knew how to use the Google Home app to adjust our thermostat when we’re away from home. As usual, our expectations were exceeded. That’s why we’ve been loyal customers for over eight years.</text>

<review>Jose Bolanos was here to install our new NEST thermostat. He is super knowledgeable and friendly, and made sure that we knew how to use the Google Home app to adjust our thermostat when we’re away from home. As usual, our expectations were exceeded. That’s why we’ve been loyal customers for over eight years.< /review>< Pics>

Johnny Reyna arrived promptly at the earliest stated time and was friendly but business like. He exhibited an excellent knowledge and took time to explain what he was doing as he worked. When questioned about the problems he was looking for and what symptoms might develop he was quick to point out that the needed repairs should only be done by a qualified professional. What was even better was his more than favorable appreciation for his employer. Johnny is welcome to service our HVAC system any time. Good Job!</Review>

<Text>Jose was Outstanding!

He was extremely knowledgeable, very pleasant and personable.  He even sent out an alert to let me know he was on his way.

He took the time to explain things to me in detail so that I had understanding of my new AC and its maintenance.  He even set up and told me how to use the Wi-Fi to program my AC.

Jose was very pleasant and personable.  He was easy to talk to, and he didn’t rush through the process.   He took time to make sure I had excellent service.

Canoga Park Heating and Air Conditioning is my all-time favorite vendor. It’s a family run business, and they treat their customers like family !!  Thanks, Jose !!< /Text>< Time>

Kevin did well. He kept us informed of his expected arrival time, arrived when promised, and went right to work. He completed the service requested, and suggested an additional procedure. He explained the benefits of the suggested work without pressing us to accept it. We are very satisfied.<//text>

The tech was great and thorough. However,  Inspection of HVAC system for purchase of house.  I must have misunderstood, I thought . I would get an estimate for repairs from the technician that came out but have to have a separate tech come out.  Since I don't yet own the home this is problematic!  In essence I paid to service the existing homeowners system and to learn what was wrong but without the estimate for the larger repair.  Wish it could have been done in one visit.<//review>

Only wanted $85 service call!! I was told that the service charge would go towards any work I had done. Guy said he couldn’t give me a price to repair my unit because only people in the office can do that. Told me we needed our new thermostat wired correctly, I asked how much to do that he said $120 ok fine wire it correctly then and I’ll use the $85 service fee towards that. NO CAN DO! I’ve unplugged the system upstairs because the wires are bad. What does that have to do with you hooking up my new thermostats correctly???? So let me get this straight....you can’t give me a quote on repairing my system, you are refusing to do any work while your here, and you want me to pay you $85 which is supposed to go towards any work I have done, but yet you won’t do anything!! And you still think I should pay you!! No way. You completed wasted my time and only wanted to collect a fee for doing no work at all!!!!   Shame On You!!!< /review>

<review>Eddie the service tech did well, except for tracking leaves in. He was very helpful at explaining some things that I can do my self to save on $$. He was also friendly and good worker. Only trouble area is getting a receipt with my correct name and address on it. Started with wrong first name, last name, city, and zip on both billing and Job address. After three tries by email to get corrected receipt, they still have wrong first name on Job address, but I am giving up on it. I am glade Eddie's knowledge of AC is better than their ability to write receipts.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Our heating unit went out on one of the coldest nights this winter.  This company couldn't initially come out the same day but while I was calling around, they called me back and was able to come out that morning. Their service man, Kevin, was very polite and efficient in assessing the problem. He had to order and pick up a part but was back as quickly as could be expected.

He has always been on time, polite, knowledgeable, and professional.

A different tech recently visited my home. When I changed the filter myself months later, I noticed that he put it in upside down. This makes me wonder if he was competent in doing the other tasks that I am unable to check. I have contacted the company but  there has been no follow up from them.<//Text>< user>

This is my second experience with Canoga Park Heating and Air Conditioning.  The best, empathetic office staff, efficient appointments.  They text before they come.  They arrive on time.  They are knowledgable and efficient.  So far everything has been relatively minor but if something big were recommended, I would totally trust them.  Not something I say lightly!!!!</Text>

CPHAC installed my central air system several years ago. Ever since, I have had them come out twice a year for maintenance, checkout & a filter change. As a result, my system always operates perfectly.

Thanks folks!< /Review>

<review>Normally a good company to service my AC, but this time I had my normal servicing and one week later my condensation wasn't coming through the outlet valve.  AC wasn't working, only pushing out warm air during a 113 degree day.  CPHAC doesn't work on the weekends and finding a reputable service company on the weekend wasn't easy.  I did get someone to come out at 7:30pm and fix it.  Should have been checked by Canoga Park Heating and Air.  Only reason for 3 stars is they are normally reliable.</review>< pics>

<Review>I am the second generation in my family to use Canoga Heating and Air.  They have always been spot on - since the 1970s - and Allen is the BEST! Fast, dependable, knowledgable and realistic.  He explains things, gives options and works fast.  I highly recommend Canoga Heating and Air and Allen!

I've worked with Allen in the past and today I found out he has retired.  Good for him - sad for me.  Then today I met Juan - WOW!  HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING🤗   he works fast, takes time to explain issues; is neat and leaves the worplace pristine.  He is patient, polite and kind.  Please send him back to my house when needed.  He is great!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Dave was on time (even a little early!), super knowledgable and friendly. I can tell Canoga Heating & Air would do a wonderful job installing a new HVAC system. Their price seemed a bit high but I get the sense it is reflective of the kind of quality and attention they would put into installing and maintaining....recommended.</text>

<Text>Canoga Park Heating and Air is the most professional and honest service provider I have ever came into contact with. The fact thier service guts don't work off commission gives me a piece of mind that the service is done correctly without, "hey you need a new this or that." They come complete the service and educate me on how to conduct proper matianance in between our annual checkup.

Two thumbs up and highly recommend them for all your heating and AC needs.</Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1575448689191, 'text': "Thank you for your five star review and two thumbs up, Dion! We're glad to provide you with quality service!"}</resp>< Gmap_id>

Kevin Castro was the technician that serviced my air conditioner.  He found the problem quickly and ordered parts to complete the job.
He was courteous and respectful.

<review>Canoga Heating and Air replaced our HVAC 15 years ago.  The installation was smooth sailing.  The system has been fantastic.  We have regular service.  The technicians are professional, courteous,  show up on time and they even wash the unit.  They always clean up after their work is done with a wonderful attitude. We usually get the same technicians.  Eddie just left,  he found a bad capacitor, he showed me how he tested it and he replaced it avoiding a system failure.  They are a family business and we feel like a part of their family.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>
