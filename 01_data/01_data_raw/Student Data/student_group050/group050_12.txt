I'm not satisfied.
Have an issue with keeping my car and I'm not going to be able to keep it I did there finance loan the finance loan company said all I need to do is get an cancellation order and I can get out of it but California sound says I got to pay $350 cash to them in order to get out of it. Because they didn't sell the product that I had originally wanted for the car they set it aside and this is the restocking fee. And have to pay the installer that they had come in on a Friday. I feel that the restocking fee and it has to be Cassius ridiculous.<//review>

$300 over charged for installation and they messed up my car my hood won't stay up after their service.. singal finder got glued on the dash I didn't buy any of their equipment only wires they blow out one of my speakers. Didn't drill my amp down left it lose, went in with 2 working 12in speakers they blew one then told me it was blown... they are ripping people off... They are the worse music shop in the high desert. The owner couldn't even face me to talk about anything.
He stayed in the back room.......< /Review>

<text>SCAMMERS AND HORRIBLE INSTALLS. For YEARS my battery would continue getting fried because of the installation they did on my car, I took it back to them and they only made matters worse. Thankfully my local audio shop fixed all the problems, did a complete rewiring and cleaned up the mess they made. DO NOT GO HERE!!!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Did not want to fix issue after 4 different visits  on the 5th visit, claimed that the warranty expired and would not fix the issue.

<text>These guys are the pinnacle of incompetence. They will quote you one price then use unpleasant scam tactics to try and get you to upgrade. Followed by the worse installation job I've ever seen. They locked by rear left window in place down in an open position and waited to see if I was going to notice and leave. Now not a week later I'm having wiring and battery issues that I'm paying a real dealership to fix now. Dont come here they'll only make your car worse.</text>< resp>

Changed from 5 stars to 2 stars after learning that my financing was actually a lease agreement for the stereo I purchased from them. Apparently I have to keep paying to keep the stereo and if I want to pay it off,  I have to pay over 1100 dollars, when I was supposedly approved for $600 credit and kept my purchase within that limit< /Review>

Be careful he will over charge not install stereo correctly and may need to take your car back several times. I know for a fact this so called of man likes to take advantage of elderly people so please be aware of what’s in your car when you leave and make sure everything works!

Great selection of product. Great deals. Great people and a great atmosphere. Best radio shop in the high desert hands down. Will definitely be returning for all my future radio needs. Anyone looking for a good stereo set up for your car, UTV, boat or motorcycle this is the place to go.<//Text>

Feels like you're buying a stereo from a shady used car salesman. The equipment works fine in the install was done very nicely. Just wish the guy selling the stuff was a little more straightforward promising you one thing and delivering another< /review>

They didn’t connect my new stereo correctly. I had to go somewhere else for them to install it correctly. The new place had to basically redo everything because “no refund”. I don’t recommend this store or the other store next to it which is owned by the same owner.< /Text>

<review>No refund policy so careful what you buy, because they are a big rip off and had my stereo installed, and they broke a a piece of the dashboard and tried replacing it or covering it up with cheap plastic. Months later my speakers blew out.</review>< pics>

Great experience with them, installation took a little while but it was definitely worth it! Issac was awesome, helped me out and got me a good system for my car at a good price! Also got some HID headlights installed and I couldn't be any happier. I will definitely be returning later on and I would refer anybody to these guys!<//review>

Why have a coupons if you are just going to up the price?!?!?!? When we had asked why is it more expensive they said because we need to up grade you. Well okay why? And they just told us we aren't gunna find a better place. But yet we found a way better place. Never give your business to these people. Please go to LA stereo.

Side note: Jorge and the policy regarding refunds in California.
Wrong – if the item is not faulty, you have no rights to a refund or exchange unless you buy online.The same applies if goods are the wrong size, unless they are clearly not the size described. Some shops may offer refunds or a credit note as part of their own in-store policies.

If the business doesn’t offer cash, store credit, or exchanges within 7 days of a purchase, they must post a ‘No Refunds or Exchanges’ notice in one of the following ways:

On a sign at each cash register and sales counter.
At each public entrance.
On tags attached to each item sold under that policy.
On the order forms or reciept, if any.

If the policy is not posted in one of these ways, ther customer is entitled to a full refund within 30 days of the purchase.<//text>< pics>

You're better off going to Best Buy. If you do any business with California Sound, be very cautious and make sure you're not getting cheated in any way.Also, make sure that those working on your car really know what they are doing. I say Best Buy or a more familiar store like Best Buy because of the quality and comfort in the offered insurance,quality of appliances/items for your car, as well as the PROFESSIONAL customer service that you'll get anytime you need it.Plus, there's one located right around the corner near the Mall of Victor Valley. Why worry when you can go somewhere more reliable and the atmosphere is just way more peaceful. That's all I have to say on my review about California Sound.< /review>

My son took it in to have his kenwood stereo installed that he purchased from Bestbuy yesterday it worked fine until he got home from school today . I went to have them look at it and he barely looked at me saying I have to come back tomorrow Telling me the stereo has to be defective.  Obviously does not back any work in his shop. Needless to say I will not recommend this shop to no one! I went back to Best buy and got an appointment for  tomorrow to fix their below standard work. They were very caring and helpful with Amazing customer service . California sound is completely lacking in theirs as well as their integrity.< /text>< Pics>

California Sound hooked up my car with the best audio for a crazy good price and even knocked out a same day installation within 3 hours! They also did my tint and were very helpful throughout the entire process. I reccomend any and everybody looking for audio/video/tinting to CALIFORNIA SOUND. Best spot in Victorville/Hesperia.< /review>

CA Sound out here in Victorille is a great spot if your lookinh for Quality installation, setup and choices of speakers. Isaac and his team took care of my 13 Harley Roadglide and my 2007 Chevy Tahoe with no discrepancies. My car and bike sound 1000 times better than it did before. Will definitely come again.<//text>

BUYERS BEWARE!
On Saturday 4/30/16, I purchased an installation kit to install my daughter's stereo, on Sunday I found out that she had already had it installed, on Monday I took back the unopened, unused installation kit, along with my receipt. The individual behind the counter was courteous, but told me that they do not issue refunds, only store credit. I told him that I was not aware of this policy and that it not posted anywhere in the store, he told me it's on the receipt and that it doesn't have to be posted. I insisted that they have to make the consumer aware of this policy prior to purchase and not after they've already taken your cash, in the form of a receipt. When I said this a man sitting next to him, rudely stated that if I didn't like this, to take them to court. I left the store with the item, and looked up California refund law, and sure enough, they are in violation. California  law states that they can issue credit, but that the policy has to be posted in the store, where customers can easily see it, or even on the merchandise itself, and it even specifies that printing it on the receipt does not cover this requirement. Since it is not posted, California law states that I have 7 days to get a cash refund.  The kit was $25, which may not be a lot of money, but at this point, I am strongly leaning towards small claims court, not only because of the principal of the matter, but also because I'm sure they've ripped off, & will continue to rip off other customers that are unaware of their ILLEGAL policy.</Text>

They lied about our income, got the limit up to $4000, and then proceeded to install the alarm. When the installer put in the power door locks, however,  the lock motor was left without clearance so that it would touch the window. When I rolled down the window, a huge scrape in my tint appeared. I called them to speak to a manager, and was told that it was not their fault. After much arguing and no budging on their part, I swore I would never shop there again and to tell everyone I know the same.

The real clincher, however, came a few weeks later when we received not one, but two credit cards in the mail, one with the amount for the alarm and another with $1000 charged to it. We immediately called the store and were told to come in so the mess could be straightened out. When we went in, the man was adamant that we had opened a second account. After looking for 20 minutes and not finding anything, he said he would call us when he found the application. Amazingly, in the 3 minutes it took to walk to our car and drive 2 blocks, he found the missing application. When we returned and saw it, it had obviously been filled out by him. He told us if we just signed it, he would give us the $1000 in cash. We said no, he argued, and we went to our car and called the sheriff, who looked at the app and laughed. We ended up getting dinged on our credit by the card cancellation and the credit theft scare made us say never again would we open a store account at some crappy little hole-in-the-wall store.

If you must go here, do so with caution, use cash, and do not left their installers work on your vehicle.</text>< GmapID>

<text>Would not recommend going here. Don't properly install radios. Bought radio on 11/20/2105 and they installed it. Isaac did my transaction.
Here it is the 12/26/2015 and my radio they installed is not working for the 2nd time since they put it in. My radio before this I had installed in 2007 never had any problems once. Only upgrade for the Bluetooth and phone support. Was cheaper then buying adapters for older radio. Wishing now I did and not got screwed by this company.< /text>< pics>

< Review>
Don't recommend this place at all, my boyfriend took his car to get the windows tinted and they left the car a mess, stickers he had on his back window were gone, and not to mention that when  he left he had found that he had a flat tire and the tire looked like it had a slightly melted hole in it when we looked at it. And also when we dropped his car off in the morning when they opened like they had said to do (mind you it was 200$ for this and already paid for), and they said it would take 3 to 4hrs to get done, and it ended up taking the whole day (7-8hrs) which was until they closed. Needless to say neither one of us were happy at all.<//Review>

Where do I begin went in to this place looking for a system for my Camry and Issac the store manager of this facility took his time to show me a perfect fit for my car audio necessity. I purchased 1 kicker subwoofer (bass speaker) a pioneer touch screen stereo and amplifier to power my subwoofer and a viper 2 way security system the install took 1 1/2 like he promised and was done professionally I will reccomed them to anyone who needs a stereo system. If I Need anything in the future I will for sure come back.. Oh And while I was waiting for my car Issac bought me lunch from in n out great customer service< /Review>

This place is a rip off! I called yesterday because the tint they put on my niece's car is bubbling and looks ridiculous.  The guy who answered the phone told me they have a 1 year, 5 year and a lifetime warranty. Her windows were done on 10-22-2014 for $150, to which he told me that this was the 5 year warranty, so I came in this morning and the  guy at the counter said they don't have 5 year warranty, so basically I'm out of luckand have been lied to.    I would never ever use this place for tint again. They don't stand behind their warranties or their quality of work. Their customer service is horrible! I recommend using another tint shop.<//text>

<response>None< /response><UserId.>112749783255671185776<//UserId.><review>The worst decision I made was coming to get my stereo here. I usually go to a different shop, but decided to try something different. Since day one the Kenwood stereo they put in has been skipping and sounds like a scratched CD on Bluetooth. I have been trying to get this repaired for months but have not had the time to go. I talk directly to the manager who said that I did not have to worry about the time frame since I had told him to when First happened. So I finally go in for a quote to get more work done with them and now all of a sudden they can't fix my problem. They called Kenwood and Kenwood said that the stereo is over a year old and there's nothing they could do without a receipt. I told them that I haven't even own this truck six months so there was no possible way I had this put in over a year ago and I have documents to prove it but they said that without the receipt since the stereo is over a year old they can't replace it which is not what the manager had already told me. Never again will I shop here and advice no one else shop here they're rude and they try to win your business by talking smack about their competitors horrible Service never again.<//review></record>

<response>None< /response><Text>If I could give them no stars I would .. This place is a total bate and switch rip off center. DO NOT GO HERE first they charge you to just look at the car then say they will apply it to your service .

First off they quote 150 for a simple alarm system.
I call say well your website says 99 can I use that they say yes. So the next day I go In there. It's a different guy he has attitude with me is very rude says its 99 plus I'll need a relay which is 30 I say but this alarm comes with a relay why would I need additional he tells me no it doesn't. Well I know for a fact it does so in the end I walk out they took my money and I went some where else. This place is a sick joke and when I went to dispute his charge because it was a they flipped the pricing 3 times they are attempting to fight it. BULLSHIT< /Text></record></dataset><record>

as the other reviews stated WAY OVER PRICED and doesn't know what they're doing when it comes to installation, I had to take my stereo and amp that they installed to another stereo shop cause of these fools. they'll sell you anything for your car without doing research. Buyer Beware!!!!!!! Almost forgot about the alarm they "installed" they never hooked up my power locks cause "my car doesn't have them" and they can care less where they leave the wires. The guy that fixed my power locks and wires said these guys did a mickey mouse job. WOULDN'T RECOMMEND TO MY WORST ENEMY.</Review>

<Review>First I was told I was going to get alpine speakers and amp installed. Lied. Got crunch amp instead. Second, they called and said my installation was done and it was ready but to LOW standards. The gave me the keys and said I was ready. I started my car and immediately heard a loud buzzing sound coming from my speakers. I began to drive off and heard the buzz get louder as I drive off. I turned back and alerted them of the issue which was just the beginning. They had also left my sub face down in my trunk just hanging by wires. They said that the wires were bad and needed to be replaced. I came back the next day and another associate tried telling me that they would have to charge me extra 40 for replacing bad wires they mistakenly used for my car. After that I went home with a decent sound and found that none of the levels were tuned. I wouldn't go back to have them touch my car because this experience showed me that there's no communication between the sales and installers. I should have just spent the good money on professional installation. Just make sure they install what they sell you. These guys didn't even turn on the stereo to see if it worked properly before giving it back to me. Very unprofessional.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>Complete waste! I paid ahead of time for a tint one week, brought my car in for the appointment and they JUST decided to tell me that they don't have a tinter. Waited a week and finally got it done. I brought my second car in for a discount for the inconvenience and the manager is giving me nothing but attitude. This whole place seems like an Arabian spam store. Never coming back.< /text>< name>

I got a good deal and there work was amazing. Now two years later My husband and I drove from Las Vegas to bring our lexus and tundra to get some upgrades done. Our lexus got a new system which my husband loves and is extremely happy with and our tundra got tinted windows once again they did an amazing job and we got a great deal, but not only did he gave us a great deal but also gave my dad a great deal on getting him a new system and window tint on his excursion and my dad was happy with their work. Thank you Issac we will be back soon and thank you for the great service and work :-)

This place is very misleadin with the fianancing they use , if they would of told me 65% after 90 days i would of went else where, then to top it off my "top of the line stereo" sucks and i hav to pay 100$$ for each function like sat radio back up cam thee is a few more thati cant think of, but i paid 1700$$ fo a stereo amp with none of the functions i paid 1300$ in 90 days thinking they might at the worst add another 100$$ no they want another 265$$$ worst exp ever DO NOT GO !!!!</review>

First night after install the stereo drained the battery, not all items on the stereo worked, back up camera was installed on the bottom of the hitch receptacle, and antennas were installed on the dash. Took it back and they replaced something that made everything work, changed locations of camera and antennas and sent us on our way. The area in the jeep where the stereo was installed was missing 3 of the 4 clips and the tape sticking the antenna on has already come loose within a month of the install. Shoddy workmanship.< /review>

These idiots threw away the charger to the alarm remote and couldn't find me a new one. They also left tint shavings all over the car and it's already starting to peal after a couple weeks. STAY AWAY<//Text>

Overally most of instructors and staff of this college and other branches of Los Rios need to see a psychologist and psychiatrist because they are enjoying via harassing and abusing students. Although there are rarely a few good and healthy persons available among them. As myself, finally I will go through from this period but I will never forget these sick people. I guarantee that this is a fair rating that I have given to these colleges.</Text>

Worst experience with prof Andre Jordan.

I took BUS 300 in Florin High School but this professor gave the best work at experience. He was very unprofessional and undisciplined. Never arranged zoom class during Covina-19 and never responded to emails.</Text>

Heads up! I love this community college but professor Linda Saeed was very lazy, unprofessional and undisciplined.

<rate>1<//rate><review>I am on my second year at crc. The first semester I was suggested the wrong classes and that automatically put me behind in my criteria. The second semester I was randomly dropped from all of my classes. After reaching out, I was put back into these classes a week after classes started. Fast forward to today; when I am not able to enroll in classes because of a hold. When I called to resolve this issue, they told me I need to call back in January, when classes continue. I will not get into classses next semester. I would not recommend this school. They do not care about their students. I would recommend going somewhere else.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<review>Got a 2.95GPA in high school. Community College was my only real option. Worked hard. Had great professors to help me. Transferred to UC Davis in 3 years. Currently in medical school.

For many of you this may be your last chance to achieve your dreams. Don't squander the opportunity that is community college!<//review><username>Benjamin Perea< /username></record>

<text>Talk about a disaster big a school.... Too many problems to even begin with. Can't get a solid answer from anyone that works here you get sent on a goose chase and have to put together the info like a puzzle. Online classes are way inaccurate says it's open but when u go to the class it's been long full. Professors run the class like a zoo spending money to sit ain't a class that no one is taking seriously. Parking lot is just chaotic and has 0 organization.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user_name>

There needs to be a ZERO.  The counseling department is is horrific.  Waiting for over an hour for a counselor to meet with me and my son.  All the coulselors are just walking around with their food bowls, hanging out in their doorways.  Not helpful at all.  Lots of wasted money at CRC.  Is this a workfare place to help with the unemployment/welfare system?  Absolutely the worst service I have ever seen.</text>

Facilities and counsellors are the worst you will ever experience in life. Not so good experience. Wouldn't recommend applying.</text>

Typical community college. Commuter school. Offers most everything you'll need for your undergrad. Parking is a little crazy and the walks are long,  but that's how most schools are these days. I used to live right across the street which was nice to avoid the parking hassles.< /Text>

My experience with this college has been troublesome,  stressful and has felt unwelcomed. I would suggest going to Sac City or Folsom instead.<//review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>I have spent my 3 years in this college just completing my general ed. The teachers and counselor are so pathetic at this particular college. Math and english department professor are great but other department teachers are worst. Sorry to say this but i have experienced racism in this college too.  I regret spending my 3 years at this school. I would suggest paying more and going to better school like sac city college, or just start your career at CSU. Don't waste your time and money at college like CRC.</text>< Pictures>

The classes were showing open on Eservice and it was asking to get the permission # from professor. Professor said no it was an error the classes are full. Too many people on waiting list. End up not having a single class for fall semester 2017. Really disappointed.< /text>

One of the employees accused me of being an illegal immigrant.

Dylan is a legend! Young entrepreneur who started this business out of his passion for the sport. Super friendly and led an excellent guided tour 👌 Highly recommend booking your next ATV adventure with this company. They picked up on the first ring and have competitive prices that can't be beat. We had a blast and will definitely be back to rip around the desert with them 🏜 10/10 would recommend them over anyone else in the area.<//text>

Phenomenal experience!!! The tour guy dude was awesome and knowledgeable about the area. Met some cool dudes under a bridge, one from my hometown of New Bedford…small world. The ATVs were in excellent condition, amazing views and the tracks were crazy fun!< /Text>

Great, friendly experience from staff. The Owner and his Son explained to us the general area,  how to ride and where not to ride. They provided all the gear, helmet, goggles, gloves (all were in clean condition) they even offered us free water (which was a nice gesture). Although they didn't have the 400cc at the time, the 250cc were fine. The various trails and routes gave us vast areas to explore. Loved the freedom.  Pricing was reasonable, $90 for two hours. Just one note, one of our our ATVs front tires needed to be replaced. There was Not much thread left, making climbing hills a little dangerous but did allow  for lots of drifting in sand :)<//text>

Kenny is straight up, honest about his prices, no added on fees (the other guy wanted $75 for gas, another $ for insurance etc).  He gives you one price!   No issues when we got back as he went around the machines.  He provides backpacks, gas, and water.   This place is the best around and I did a lot of research before I rented.  Don’t go anywhere else besides Kenny’s place!!!!  Thank you for a great adventure!!!!

This was an awesome experience! I’ve wanted to ride an ATV for a while now and was kinda nervous. Clinton was a very good guide and was super patient! He let us go at our own pace and and stopped every once in a while to make sure we were good. My family and I had an amazing time. Thank you Clinton for being super friendly and patient with everyone in our group :)</Review>

This place is absolutely incredible!! When I went with my family, we rode in the ATVs, and it was the most fun I have had in a long time. It’s a bit expensive, but that would probably be the only downside to this. Also, the price is pretty much worth it. We rode the ATVs for 2 hours. There was miles of open space to roam and also hills and mountains to ride over. It is unbelievably breathtaking. So beautiful. When you get there, you get a helmet, goggles, and optional gloves. You get to try out the vehicles before actually paying so you know which one you have to pay for. When I went, I didn’t have any cash on me, so they didn’t get a tip. If you do go, and I highly encourage you to, be sure to leave a generous tip! Definitely would go again!</Text>

Great time and even better price. Expected to pay 150-200$ and I was able to rent for two hours for $90.00.
Bikes were older but ran like a top. No issues at all. Trails were good and you could roam where you wanted. Would def rent from Kenny again.
Thanks!!!</review>

Its a bit far from anything but dont let the drive fool you
The scenery going there is out of this world
Once there the people were friendly
The ATV  was in great shape
Rental price is very reasonable
Offered bottle water to take with me
Riding area has everything  from first timer to expert
I definitely would reccomend and will go back<//text>

Took my family for an adventure in the desert, Ken was super friendly and very informative, I have lots of experience and was very impressed with his operation and condition of his equipment. No issue or problems with anything. Large selection at a very reasonable price, highly recommended.<//text>

One reason that I go to rally is because of Robins professional and friendly service that she gives every time I go in to Rally. I had Robin as my service provider for many years I appreciate her great service. The other reason is that I get genuine GM parts for my vehicle.<//Review>

<review>They were very communicative and detailed in all the questions I had over email. Greg went out of his way to work with my schedule and needs. They had everything all ready to go knowing that I was on a tight schedule when I arrived. The manager was really nice as well. I think these guys did a great job.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I communicated with Iris to let her know the issues I was having with my GMC 3500. She knows I work during the day and couldn't swing by, so she was able to set up a time at 4:30pm today with the tech. I didn't catch his name but he did service my truck last time. He re-ballanced the wheels after he checked the alignment. I was out of there in an hour and fifteen minutes and my truck rides perfect again. They even let me bring my dog inside the service area waiting room. Thank you again and we'll see you next time!!</text>< Pictures>

Set up the apt. Was told on the phone it would take 1 hour. When arrived 10 minutes early, service rep told me that there were a bunch of people ahead of me and could not tell me what time car would be done. I walked around for a while, returned and pressed the rep for a time again. Then, with resentment, the rep said he would pull some strings and have the car ready in 1.5 hours and not to go anywhere. No more GMC for me...< /review>

I don't like being lied to... After my truck was dropped from the lift and damaged a few years ago I was promised 3 free oil changes. Never received them and the notes about it in the computer can't be found. If you recall, I had to contact Corp GMC during my warrantee period just to get answers after the Dealership stopped talking to me over that incident.  Then this latest trip I was promised that the truck would be ready in one day and that it would come with a car wash. After my service of over $1000 was completed FIVE days later, Service Rep has my truck brought up for pickup. I noticed right away it wasn't washed. Someone had lied to him so he in turn lied to me. Now I'm questioning if ANY of the service work was actually completed. I love GMC products but this dealerships service is terrible. If I pay the premium price of a Dealership, everything better be above board and I should not be left wondering why I keep going back. Pepboys is a lot cheaper, faster and I know they'll do the promised work.<//Text>

First I would like to thank you in advance for taking the time to read this, I had appointment on 09/10/20 at 1pm  I showed up on time and was told to park my truck and proceeded to get checked in approx.1:20pm and my truck was taken back for a oil change, tire rotation and a wash, after about a hour waiting around 2:30 I checked on my truck and was watching the technician struggling with my tires, Assuming we were almost done I continue to wait approx. 3:30pm I checked again and now it appears he was just starting the oil change and now I'm getting a concerned so ask the service advisor why the delay, and I was told the technician was new, And what my observation was that the technician in no hurry at all everything was in slow motion and he kept leaving my truck several times, At that point the advisor saw I was getting a little Impatient, So the advisor went out to ask him what was taking so long, Finally at 4:00, my truck was pulled out and was done, I proceeded to leave and go out and my truck wasn't washed I go back in and talk to the service advisor and she said it was done so I asked her to get up and go look it wasn't washed and had oil finger prints on the side she agreed and told them to wash it, Finally at 4:30 it was done, Actually it wasn't done the truck was only wiped down nothing was else cleaned especially the wheels, So at that point when I left your service dept. Thinking to myself how can you stay in business it took 3.5 hours for a oil change, I have a appointment 09/15/20 for several recalls with your dealership that I'm going to cancel, I don't feel like I'm a valued customer and would not recommend your service department to friends,Family or colleagues,< /Review>

I brought My truck in for service because it is having intermittent hard shifts and random shuddering. After it was diagnosed, repaired, and returned to me it has gotten worse. I immediately returned back to the dealership, however I was told I have to drive 1000 miles before the dealership can proceed with further repairs.</Text>

JC was a very personable sales person. We called ahead of time and he had the car we wanted to see prepped and ready for a test drive. Everyone else was very friendly as well and the finance person was incredibly efficient. We were in and out in two hours, which is a record at a dealer for us.<//Review>

We took our 2009 GMC Acadia in for a flashing engine check light and other issues.  Tania, our service rep, got our vehicle scheduled for service and explained all that needed to be accomplished.  She provided us with the cost of these repairs.  We approved them and they ordered the necessary parts and provided us with great service.< /Text>

<text>Made an appointment a week ago,  to get factory recalls done on my car, the young lady that helped me ensured that the parts will be on time and the work will take a few hours,  I told her that I will gave to take the day off, which I did. I  set at this said appointment for 3 hours and 15 minutes to be told that the major part for the job was not their and that it will not be their until the day after,  where was the customer service of giving me the opportunity to change the work to be done if the part wasn't in, that way I dont miss work and change it to another day. For that they get 2 stars.👎</text>< response>

<Review>Service adviser was great, easy to talk to and good attitude. Problem was when I picked up my truck it had obvious grease/grime on the driver door handle, the center console, and the steering wheel. I showed this to the server adviser who was willing to take it back to clean but why should I have to ask for it to be cleaned? Five stars for service adviser, zero stars for grease monkeys. Unfortunately for service adviser, I will not be taking my vehicle back here again. Very, very basic rule....clean up after yourself!<//Review>< pictures>

This was not the best experience for me. Had to sit for hours even when I had a set scheduled appointment. Once my vehicle was completed and I came home, I had to return because my oil cap wasn't replaced properly therefore causing oil to leak from my vehicle. Also there was another issue with my vehicle that informed the maintenance guy about and instead of looking into the issue which was covered by my warranty he goes and clears it with his machine and tells me that it's nothing wrong. I was truly disappointed in the services received on 5/1/2017. I wouldn't be recommending them to anyone until they improve their quality of service to the customers.<//review>

<response>None< /response><Review>I want to give this 10 stars but it won't let me. First off. If your going to get a GMC. Witch I highly recommend. Go threw Ian and Edgar. These guys know what your looking for in a truck and will not hesitate to make you feel at home. They took my trade in and gave me a smoking deal! Edgar was out by my side in 100° weather and helped me the whole way threw my search. Not like other dealers who will come to see you and tell you to come fetch them when you found the right vehicle. Nope not Edgar. He made sure to explain every which way I could go with my buy and he knew these trucks inside and out. Very professional and super honest. Now for Ian! This guy is amazing. Knows his stuff when it comes to dealing with the banks and makes sure you are taken care of properly. I couldn't believe the  deal he got me! No one could of done it better! I highly recommend this place to anyone especially going through Ian and Edgar. The best team I've dealt with for buying a vehicle!! This place blows antelope valley Chevy out of the water hands down!</Review></record></dataset><record>

I took my 2010 Cadillac SRX in for a radio and nav panel issue. The problem was diagnosed right away and parts ordered.  In addition, a previous repair was found to be failing.  The transmission rear seal was replaced at no cost to me. I never would have found it on my own,  My hat is off to the thoroughness of the Rally technicians. Thanks to them and the excellent advisor service.</text>

FYI don't always think that convince is in your favor after a unsuccessful visit at Nissani Bros. Chevy Dealer in Culver City, CA., took my vehicle to Rally Chevy Dealer in Palmdale CA. received excellent service from Mr. Phillip (advisor), cashier, and mechanics. It's always good to deal with individuals with self dignity, honesty, and integrity.
Thank You,
Rally<//Text>

The Rally GM service department is one of the best I've ever been to. Their setup is perfect. Everytime the mechanics find an issue, the service reps notify / take you back to the lifts if any issues that pop up. I always request David McCrae to be my service rep. He's very helpful and courteous.<//Text>

<review>I dropped off my vehicle at 10am. I was advised that it would be ready by 2pm. I called at 2pm to inquire about the status of my vehicle. No one would or could give me any information. I went to the dealer at 2:30pm. I still could not ascertain the status of my vehicle. At 3:00pm my service representative arrived from a 'meeting' and stated that my vehicle was being 'road tested.' I received my vehicle at 4:00pm. I missed a critical medical appointment because of this. Apologies and discounts don't make up for what I consider to be poor and negligent service.</review>< Date>

< Review>
As a first time buyer it is a nerve racking experience but a few members of the Rally team Bryon Gelfo and Mitch Nakamura made the process a positive and smooth experience. I couldn't be happier with the quality of customer service, knowledge and financial advice that we received while at the Palmdale Rally group! I would highly recommend this facility to anyone who is looking to buy a vehicle!< /Review>

Not real happy. Made an appt and was told it would take 4-6 hrs to look at my car? Why make an appt if it's not gonna get looked at for half the day? What is the appt for? I could just go there and wait that long!</Text>

Garbage store, garbage staff. All they do is talk bad about customers and force them into vehicles they don't want just so they can hit bonus. Pat is one of the worst GM I have ever encountered.< /text>

Scheduled a 10 am appointment. Arrived a few minutes early to not even be acknowledged for 6 minutes. Only to then wait for another 10 minutes to talk to a rep and be told my oil change will take about 2 and a half hours.<//review>

Great drive-up experience. Fast line, quick service. Order was correct and coffee was tasty. I wish they'd open for inside and/or outside seating.< /Review>

<Review>Love getting Starbucks as a special treat for my family. This location always has fast lines, but their drive thru window is awkwardly far from where the curb ends.</Review>< user>

<review>Brand new Starbucks at Foothills and Vineyard. It is very spacious inside and has everything you'd expect in a Starbucks. It had a drive through as well. The baristas were very friendly and service was fast. Very clean place.<//review>< Resp>

<text>Very rude employee working the drive-thru 04/03/21 @12:43pm w/butterfly tattoo. She is the opposite of the familiar friendly people at SB. No name tag, so I don’t have her name.  Her attitude doesn’t belong in a service oriented business. C’mon management!<//text>< Pics>

The BEST location to order a drink around town! This location does the best in town. Better than other roseville and antelope locations. They make the drinks delicious like they should taste and make it like they would want to drink it. Not just throwing it together to move onto the next person like other starbucks. Go here. They are super nice too and not fake feeling.< /Text>

Nice, larger space. As a disabled person using a scooter, easy to get around inside, including the bathrooms.<//Text>

<Rate>4</Rate><Review>The park itself is great for a quick walk. It's in a beautiful neighborhood and you can watch the planes take off. It's not very big. Green grass. On Leash. It's the inconsiderate dog owners that ruin it. DON'T tie your unfriendly dog to the poop bag dispenser post (her words) Nothing about that makes sense. Ruined the walk and fresh air.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>This park is really a small patch of grass in the middle of suburbia, yet it offers an unrxpected charm.  It typically just serves as a rest stop for me while I'm following the bike route on Chatsworth.  I've been pulling my 2 year old and our micro dog along in bike trailer and this gives the two of them a chance to get out and walk together.  The hedges on one side give a bit of privacy that makes you feel your presence isn't too intrusive to the neighborhood.  The park has a slope from the surrounding streets to the middle.  This helps the park's diminutive size as it gives the little ones towards the middle away from the street and provided a natural position for you to sit down and observe them.<//review>< pictures>

Its best that it's a valley among all the houses that surround it.  I suppose it's nice if you live there.  I wont make the trip back out though.  I was just being spontaneously adventurous.<//Text>< pics>

Grass.  2 trash cans.  That's it.  Pocket park for kids & dogs to stretch their legs, adults to run into each other and talk.  All other neighborhoods should have these parks or better, too.<//text>

Great space for your dog to sniff around and wander. Dogs must be on leash. Dog poo bags are provided. Nice neighborhood.</Review>

<text>Our family vacationed at this 1.2-January. Thank you for a good rest. If possible, be sure to visit this cozy, clean, nice hotel.
We would like to note the professional work employee Sean. He warmly greets and escorts visitors. Promptly checked all areas of recreation (swimming pool, sauna, steam room, Jacuzzi, gym), responded favorably to the requests.

We recently used Comfort Inn Calistoga for our wedding in California. The staff was very helpful and courteous to us while we stayed. They even let us store luggage before we checked in! The rooms are very clean and spacious and the location is close to downtown Calistoga. We were very happy with our stay and would recommend them.<//review>

< Review>
The remodeled rooms are great with plenty of extra room. The only problem that I had was with the shower. The half door made it difficult to stay warm due to my wife blasting the air conditioner. Hotel is a not in the main downtown area but is just a short walk. I recommend you visit Vincent Arroyo about 1.3 miles away. Don't walk it though because there is no sidewalk.</Review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><review>Worst hotel experience ever.  The motel is under renovation and our room was not quite finished.  But the real problem was the hot water system broke and we had no hot water for two days. Still got charged over $300 a night for the room.   Mgr no where to be seen.  We have been trying to contact him for three weeks now and he is not answering phone calls or e-mails.  And we also have $1400 worth of unauthorized charges on our credit card from the Calistoga Comfort Inn for a room we did not stay in.  I will never go here again!  Mgr should be fired.</review></record></dataset><record>

Stayed here on my last trip to Calistoga. Even though they are in the remodeling stage, the stay was very comfortable. The front desk personnel were extremely friendly and helpful in recommending things to do. which enhanced our visit. Will definitely stay here on future visits and have already recommended the facility to numerous friends.</review>

Loved, loved, loved our stay here.  We spent one night in Calistoga on our honeymoon and loved relaxing in the hot tub, steam room and sauna.  Plus, the staff was amazingly helpful from providing bottle openers to dinner suggestions and other insights.  The rooms were clean and we really enjoyed our time in town!</review>

Amazing rooms, mineral pool, hot tub.
Close to town, and all sorts of geothermal possibilities nearby.
Could have stayed for days.
Comfy bed, fluffy towels, just go.

<Review>To start with the positives, the hotel is located closely to the center of downtown Casriloga, so is very easy to get to nearby restaurants. The pool, fed by natural mineral water from hot springs is also very comfortable and enjoyable to swim in. However, there were a few negatives from the stay. When we got to the hotel, the showers were not working at all, as they were working to fix the hot water heater. The staff had no good solutions but to wait for them to fix it sometime that day. Definitely a big concern given that we needed to get ready for a wedding that afternoon. Fortunately it was fixed in time, though still a big inconvenience. Overall there was also a lot of construction going on, and made the place look a little messy. I'm sure in some time the place will be a great stay, but may need some time to finish renovations.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808443060bcf630b:0xad6634829d76bd7b</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Rooms are recently updated, very nice. Still some construction​ going on so it was a bit noisy. Breakfast was ok, what you expect for a continental breakfast. Pool and hot tub were a nice extra.<//Text>

Mother's Day in Calistoga, and we stayed at comfort Inn. Lovely location on the outskirts of town, neighboring a grassy oak dotted field. Beautiful birdsong in the morning, quiet night. Our room was beautiful and smelled fresh. The tub wasn't clean, and it wouldn't drain, so only one of us could shower. Then Mom noted the Kleenex was out. I went to get her TP, and the roll was very low. We didn't bother the manager,  but didn't leave a tip for housekeeping either.< /text>

10 minute walk to town. Updated rooms look great - an obvious update to a standard Comfort Inn. Quite modern and spacious even with 2 queen sized beds. However, the "continental breakfast" is a feast of carbs.</review>

Reserved handicapped room one month in advanced, the check in clerk gave up the room to a last minute walk in. I was informed that it was incumbent on me to let them know that I needed to lock in the reservation - it would seem to me that it would be on them to confirm that with me. As a consolation they took $20 off my bill. I left a message with the GM and never returned my call...</Review>

<text>Terrible service and uncarring. I went to Google and asked if the chain allowed dogs which google replied for $15 they did when I got there 2.5 hours away from my house the told me this one was different and the would charge me 250 if I had a dog. I said goggle said the chain let dogs stay. So, at 11 at night I had to drive back to my house and they charged me that night. The next day I returned and my reserved room I was in and sleeping in was sold and the other people came into my room. I called corp. nothing has been done, the manager or owner was supposed to call never did.</text>< Pics>

<name>John Economides<//name><Date>1478094178721</Date><Rate>2<//Rate><Review>From the outside, this hotel appears to be "quaint". But once you actually get inside your room, you find that it's no different from your run of the mill 20 year old Holiday Inn.
Discolored paint, peeling wall paper, a bathroom that has clearly had a thorough using. Air conditioning unit that still has unit mounted controls. Light bulbs that long ago ceased to be color matched (daylight or soft white people, it's not hard).

There are a few stars here, the bedside alarm clock is completely dimmable to the no light position while retaining alarm functionality. That same clock also has two edison outlets and two USB outlets for charging gadgets. Enough that I didn't have to worry about unpacking my travel power strip.

There's a dorm room sized refrigerator in the room. And a Safeway a mere 8 miles away. There's a microwave in the lobby... but that brings me to my next detraction.

The lobby is only staffed/open from 7AM-10PM. They start serving breakfast at 7AM, so I am curious why the lobby isn't open an hour prior to that. Much less staffed and open 24HR regardless.

I'm only a day in, so I'm sure there will be more things I notice in the coming week. If you're listening, Choice Hotels... you should consider changing your brand standards.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

My sister Linda and I LOVED  our stay for 2 nights Sept. 29-30, 2013 at Calistoga's Comfort Inn,  Sean checked us in Sunday afternoon and out Tuesday morning, and he was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the area, Napa Valley in particular.   The buffet was awesome each morning, with sausage and eggs, as well as made to order waffles, and you could have tea or coffee anytime of the day.  The beds were the most comfortable I  have stayed on.  Serta mattresses are the best!  I highly recommend this very clean, very convenient Inn just outside the downtown Calistoga area.  Definitely will plan to stay with Comfort Inns again in the future when traveling.<//Text>

<resp>None<//resp><pictures>None< /pictures><rate>2<//rate><review>Considering it was over $300/night, the value for the room was not there.
To start off with, our room towels were still damp. "probably the dryer didn't dry them correctly"  - Probably? lets hope it was that. They did exchange the towels quickly.
Room - meh. nothing special
facilities - meh. nothing special
location - meh. nothing special
area amenities - meh. nothing special. Not their fault though. You could go see a castle. Exciting right? Naw, It as built about 70 yrs ago. Laying bastards.
Hot water for showers - NON EXISTENT! Was told to run it for a few minutes and when that didn't produce hot water - ~10mins of running - was told apparently the whole town has issues with hot water. Those damn communal hot water tanks. So unreliable.
Bottom line, it was your typical, comfort inn room that they jack up the prices because its close to Napa. Next time, just go to Napa and justify the costs.
Please, next time, lube me up before you violate me</review><Date>1430961305854< /Date></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>Terrible drive thru service. Speaker was not working so I couldn't order until I got to the window. The line of cars moved like molasses. I definitely don't plan to there again until this business makes some much needed repairs. Did I mention that the ice cream flavors were written on a piece of cardboard. So TACKY!!!< /review>< Pictures>

They need to replace the outdoor drive thru menu, the flavors are written in marker on a torn strip of cardboard taped to the broken menu board. The ice cream was a little freezer burnt, the peanut butter choco flavor I got was full of ice crystals but the cookie dough scoops were fine. Great location, fast service, and nice employees but the buisness itself needs fixing indoors and out. I'll come back but I really hope they get the repairs they need soon</review>

The ice cream is frozen burnt and they never have 31 flavors.. Then they have the flavors written on cardboard. So tacky.They need to shut this place down already.Its a disgrace to all the other Baskin-Robbins. It makes me never want to go back to another Baskin-Robbins ever.<//Text>

<Review>I was charge 6 extra dollars after them telling me the same price would be applied because they didn't have a flat waffle cone for a sundae so instead they added a waffle cone with 2 scoops on the side. I was really disappointed because this is my regular ice cream place and it felt like I was ripped off :/ overall really good ice cream and decent customer service.<//Review>< Pics>

This person below obviously doesn't know that Baskin Robbins is part of a corporations, which has a guide for the employees to follow for every single thing. The employees are just doing their jobs as smoothly as they can. Don't be so judgmental about others religion and assign characteristics, you don't know them.

Anyways, this place is awesome. :)<//Review>

<review>Be careful about the cake sizes. Baskin uses their own unique cake sizing. Their full sheet is 8x8. What a joke, and that is almost $50!
The last two visits to this store have been very frustrating. Very slow service from very slow staff. Take that however you want.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

< review>
February 28th, 2019 at around 9:30p.m my boyfriend and brother went here to get my family and I 4 banana splits. He tells me he waited 15-20mins in the drive thru and not once did someone answer him to take his order. Then, he starts yelling hello and still no answer, so he decides to let the car behind him go so he drives around and says he sees two people just walking around doing nothing. Then he gets back in the drive thru he hears someone taking the person's order. He finally orders and here's the guy in the back complaining about having to do these orders. It gets worse when the food comes home.
My 2 year old son, myself and my boyfriend were eating the banana split then my boyfriend found a FREAKING HAIR! Not just any hair it looks like a thick PUBE hair! So, I called this morning in Hope's to speak to a manager that would HELP. HA, She was just as bad. She tells me she was allegedly there last night there and then says "let me call the employees that worked last night, can you call back around 4 or 5 p.m today?" I said what for? She replies " Because I cant just call them right now, some of our employees have lives and go to school and other stuff I cant just call them" I'm like are you serious right now, I dont need you to speak with your employees I want my refund! She YELLS "I CANT JUST GIVE YOU A REFUND, I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED FIRST" I replied you're not going to give me a refund even if I have the picture proof of what happened! My son was eating that and thats just disgusting! She yells at me again "I CAN ONLY GIVE YOU A REFUND BUT FOR ONE BANANA SPLIT!"
I'm absolutely appalled at the customer service we have recieved from here, please do everyone a favor and FIRE these people. There is plenty of people with GREAT customer service experience that would be better suited for the job! And I still want a refund for this disaster. This honestly does not even deserve ONE star it deserves nothing.</review>

We literally waited for like 5 minutes I said excuse me 3 times got no response! So we pull up to the window a lady passes by the window try's to completely ignore us acts like she didn't see us so we honk and no one comes to the window!!!! So we pull around pass by the front and one girl is in the corner while the other girl is picking up chairs already by this time it's only 9:11pm and they don't close till 10:00pm. So I called them, a lady answers the phone I asked what time they close she said not till 10:00 but it's slow so "she thinks" they are only serving the drive thru! So I told her we were just in the drive thru and explained what happened she said sorry their box keeps going out so they just naturally assume the costumer leaves. So I explained okay but we even came to the window and we're completely ignored and she just said sorry.</Review>< pics>

<review>Manager has argued with me over coupons not very good customer service. This place looks very outdated from the inside out, it looks like the employees work in a clustered mess and the speaker for drive-thru is horribly loud and makes the whole "dine in" experience VERY unpleasant, i feel bad for any employees that have to use that speaker,  I went to tip the nice girls who helped me and she explained that her manager took away the tip jar.  Im a local and these kids work hard especially during summer and i always have tipped them. i have not seen one improvement in years to that franchise. im a mother of two and i would not let my kids work here not even as a start off job. long story short the manager will argue over coupons but cant make improvements? ive seen their business its frequent especially on weekends/holidays so there is no reason they cant afford to buy new equipment and give the place a face lift that it so desperately needs... Thanks for reading -Molly R. anyone else have any of these issues here?<//review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) I ordered a cake and when I went to pick it up they had already sold it and no apology. Besides, the employees laughed. I do not recommend it.

<user_name>themaddoxhenry (TheMaddoxHenry)< /user_name><Review>My son drives all the way from Santa Barbara to Oxnard for
Martial Arts at Legacy because we only want the best school for him. Mr. Gregory is a tough, kind, fair and thoughtful instructor. He holds his students to a very high standard, teaches them real discipline, confidence, self defense, proper technique and form, explains why the technique is important and maintains a positive culture at the school. His instructors are all top notch as well.  For us there is no other school better than Legacy from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles, and we know because we used to drive to Los Angeles for my son’s training. Absolutely five stars. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<review>Me and my 8yr old son have been coming to Legacy since November of 2020. He needed some kid interaction and confidence after such a crazy year. I saw they had family classes and thought it would be great exercise and something fun to do together!
I am so so SO pleased with our decision to join! After our first try out class, my son and I were hooked! The staff is amazing! They create this warm and motivating atmosphere that encourages us to always try our best and never give up.
As a parent, it's just what I needed for my son! We get to bond and he gets the confidence he needs during these trying times. I also get him off those videongames *eye role* And as a single parent, I'm blessed he has other role models and great people he can look up to. Honestly, there are mom's their I look up to also.
I could seriously rave on and on about Legacy; the staff, the students, how clean they are, how strong, how funny, how exciting, how challenging. All of it!
If you're reading this and looking to get your kid interested in something other than video games (especially if they don't like sports), give Legacy a try! Also, don't be shy to try the class yourself, whether you have kids or no kids. You're tougher than you think and stronger than you thought!</review>< pics>

<date>1522710101952</date><Rate>5< /Rate><text>I started training on the Legacy Martial Arts Family Fitness Center program over a year ago. I moved to California and it took me around 4-5 months to find a place that I truly love. I have been studying and training martial arts for over 10 years and I must say that this is one of the best programs in the county.

Some of the things I look for in a good martial arts program is commitment, integrity, family oriented, high intensity training, respect and can also have instructors that are willing to help teach and have the patience to instruct not only adults but children. The family environment in the studio you can feel it from the moment you walk in the studio, they take you in as family.

The instructors at Legacy Martial Arts are all well rounded martial artists. They work with your fundamentals so you can have a great base to keep learning more complicated things. They take your needs and goals to make you the best version of yourself you can be. The instructors are State Champions, District Champions and World Champions ranging from Forms to Sparring. They take your needs whether it is becoming healthier, competitive taekwondo, learning self-defense or just wanting to do something different and learn. Once they know what you are looking for they focus on making you the type of person in the martial arts world you want to become. With your hard work, will come great results, they will push to get the best out of you. They are professionals in what they do and it shows in every action and class they perform. They are known in the county and around the entire USA for their completeness, way of teaching and structured program with in the studio.

Seeing the Tiny Tigers program (children) you can see how creativity meets morals. By mixing fun active learning and respect they teach the children about self-control, integrity, honor, commitment and leadership. The instructors also don’t stop in teaching your kids about martial arts but how to be a successful leader. They help your child gain more confidence and in a short amount of time that develops into creating leaders, on and off the studio. By implementing creative thinking the instructors also have a system in place to make sure that your child will also try and get better grades in school, be more respectful to other people and have self-control in their actions.

The adult program always has more than twenty adults. Normally the adult classes in other studios I have been in are very low. Some student’s parents start out bringing their kids and quickly want to join the training themselves. This is the type of family environment that all the instructors bring to this studio. The adults all encourage each other to strive for a better future on and off the studio. One day your training together and the other you are in a gathering having fun and talking about goals, the future and even your professional careers.

As a martial arts competitor for Legacy Martial Arts studio I have learned that if you have a goal and you are willing to put in the work the instructors will take you to that level. They will push you in ways you never thought you could reach, finding out that the barriers you use to put yourself, get taken down with dedication and commitment. The instructors will push you so that you can accomplish your goals and aspirations in your martial arts carrier.

The facilities are top notch. It is a big space that has everything you need. The instructors keep it tidy and clean all the time. There is a spectator section at the entrance of the studio were parents or people can come look at the class before joining. The equipment used in training is also always clean and up to date.

I would refer this place to anyone that is curious about martial arts or wants to keep going on their journey to becoming a better martial artist and person. Between the environment the studio provides and the type of training they provide there is no doubt in my mind if you try it you will understand what I am saying. Come check it out for yourself and be the judge.<//text>< Pictures>

This place is okay... but they don't have a very good kid curriculum.. they just stick young children in class with people much older and with much higher abilities and expect your child to just catch on... my daughter hated this place after the first month she complain she had no idea what was going on and when I tried to address it they say just keep coming to class you'll get it eventually.... as a person who has taken his martial arts his entire life I did not agree with their approach or system I have since changed martial arts studios and my daughter is much happier... not saying this studio is horrible but it's not really setup or geared to younger children< /Text>

My girls started late January 2021 and have seen an immense change. Not only are they more assertive, they take initiative in discipline (making their bed, amongst other things). As a single mother, this has been a huge help and I’m looking forward to where this will possibly lead them in the future. Thank you, Legacy MA Team! 🙏🏽<//review>< Pictures>

We have two of our boys at Legacy and we couldn’t be happier with their growth in these past two years. Both have grown so much individually in their Legacy class and at home. The life skills are my personal favorite along with the leadership skills. Legacy has a helpful staff that’s always welcoming and easy to talk to. Mr. Gregory is an amazing person and instructor. He’s great with the kids and with us parents. We want our children to learn as they do sports and he does just that. Thank you Mr. Gregory for what you do, I can see how much you care and want your Legacy kids to achieve their goals.</review>

<Text>Couldn't be happier with the decision we made for our 5 yr. old son to give Legacy Martial Arts a go! He now loves it and tells/shows all of his aunts and uncles his new moves. The sensei is an awesome guy. Focuses on discipline and form. Love his dad jokes.. bahaha.. Covid safe environment and great for the fam.<//Text><userid>114360538801869206911< /userid>< Pictures>

Legacy Martial Arts is a great foundation of learning for kids. From the moment you step in, you are introduced to a friendly atmosphere of professional instructors. My son is very introverted, but after attending a few classes, he slowly became more confident. Now he is totally hooked and can't wait to attend the next class. I highly recommend this place if you want your child to learn self-defense and make new friends all in a positive learning environment.< /review>

My son and I both take a Martial Arts class together here. I just wish we would have joined along time ago, because it has improved his self-confidence, self-discipline, guidance and to be dedicated. This place is a very positive training atmosphere that promote a healthy lifestyle and has made a significant impact in all areas of our lives! I feel my child is taught Martial Arts in a safe and enjoyable atmosphere that empowers us while reinforcing good moral values such as respect, gratitude and courtesy. My son and I love being trained by someone as knowledgeable as Sir Gregory and his amazing staff! I definitely recommend this place for people of all ages to see what a great this place really is, I give it two thumbs up! ATA all the way...<//text>

<Text>I travel across the US providing photography services to martial arts schools.  Nowhere have I seen the level of skill in instruction.  Mr. Gregory not only has the respect of his students and their parents but he also has their trust.  He has continually demonstrated an extreme level of involvement not only in their training, but also in their personal development.  If you are in the Oxnard area and are looking for sport and self defense, as well as character development for you or your child, Legacy Martial Arts is the place for you.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

This is the second school I have attended. And I have to admit it has been a better experience. There is always someone on the mat helping you. I attend the Hyper fight club classes and they are intense. It is a great workout. I always come out feeling better than when I came in. So far it has been a great experience.<//review>

<review>Legacy Martial Arts is hands down the best martial arts school in Oxnard.  My family have been students there for 3 years.  Its been great training alongside my kids and sharing common goals with them.  Instructors are great and really care bout their students.  Mr. Gregory the owner and chief instructor brings the best out of all his students.  I really suggest anyone interested in martial arts training for themselves or their family come by and see for themselves.<//review><Time>1390630573004</Time>< gmap_id>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>This place is the absolute best! I am a very involved stay at home Mom, always looking for the “BEST” activities, places to bring my kids and people to bring into my children’s life. Legacy Martial Arts is a very unique martial arts facility, they use real life self-defense scenarios that the children must learn and test. A variety of weapons are also introduced through their different cycles. Unlike the commonality of today in which most children’s sports and karate dojos hand over belts and trophies, students at Legacy are NOT handed their belts. This is one of many reasons why I liked them. A child must be present, must work hard and be respectful. The children have goals set by their instructors. All of these things mixed in with instructors that make their classes fun and exciting by acknowledging birthdays, annual summer potlucks, parades and tournaments. Here they will teach your children a variety of things such as self defense, speaking in front of peers, directing classes, getting over fears, and mastering their forms. This school has helped my 8 year old develop in ways we didn’t think possible, from being a very shy little gal, she now stands in front of her peers and leads the class, something I never though I’d see. My kids look forward every week to attending class, earning their stripe, and seeing their friends. Mr. Gregory and Miss Rosales create a very safe environment for the students. Here they feel comfortable and safe to be their best, learn and succeed. The studio is a bit far commute from where we live but my husband and I don’t mind at all. This is a very well rounded martial arts facility. I’d recommend to anyone and everyone.</Review>< pics>

<review>I started training here when I was 12 years old and almost 10 years later I am still here motivated and kicking. What keeps me here is the family atmosphere; they make me feel like I'm part of their family and not just a stranger training. Legacy Martial Arts is the place to go to for the latest innovative teachings and just plain out the funnest place to learn how to kick some booty. Before I joined Legacy Martial Arts, I was very shy and didn't have the courage to speak my mind; I always just ran with the crowed. After a few classes, I got the courage to be different and do what I love to do. This place is hands down the best martial arts school! But don't just take my word for it. Come check this place out and see the awesome students.< /review><resp>None< /resp>< rate>

Legacy Martial Arts has been a blessing for my son.  I have seen him grow since being at this school.  The instructors are amazing.  They really challenge every one of their students to reach their full potential.  It's not only teaching martial arts and self-defense, they also have an array of other classes.  All in all, if you are looking for a great school to send your child or ever thought of doing martial arts for yourself, this is the studio for you.  You will get fit, meet great friends, and, most of all, have fun doing it.<//review>

<Text>What I wanted my four year old son to gain from Legacy Martial Arts was confidence, respect for adults and self defense training. In a few months he has reached those goals and then some. The fun yet structured classes were just what he needed to go from shy and timid to confident and courageous. Seeing the older kids display their skills shows the Tiny Tigers what they can become if they work hard and never quit. It's inspiring. The staff members are professional, polite and amazing instructors, not to mention impressive and accomplished. I would recommend  Legacy Martial Arts to any one with children of any personality.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>Currently in the Hyper Fight Club class at Legacy Marital Arts and I am really enjoying the class. The instructors are energetic, constantly motivating you to keep working through it and to give it your all in order to achieve better results. They are always around helping you to correctly grasp the concept of the moves. It is a great place to get fit and in the process you are learning self-defense moves. It is such a fun class, I recommend bringing your friends or family members with you to make it make it and even more enjoyable experience.<//Text></record>

This is absolutely an amazing program. The facility is clean, welcoming, and family friendly. I saw an extreme change in my sons self discipline as soon as his 2nd class. The instructors run with a velvet fist; friendly, approachable, understanding but firm & strict. Respect is an understatement on how I feel towards the staff, program, & facility.< /review>

<Review>Fake business reviews at its finest. The instructors really know how to smooch their way out of their shortcomings. Nothing good about this so called "Taekwondo".

This is THEE best martial arts studio in Oxnard. I shopped around town to make sure my son got the best training and this studio was the best environment for many reasons. Mr. Gregory and his staff are always involved. You can tell that they all have a genuine intent on molding the best students. This school is a big part of our family's life.</Text>

<rate>5< /rate><Pictures>None</Pictures><text>My daughter has been attending classes at Legacy Martial Arts for 3 years now and she absolutely loves it. We tried other taekwondo studios and nothing compares to Legacy Martial Arts. The instructors treat the children with respect, expect them to try their best, encourage them, and check in on them if they are having trouble with things other than martial arts. The school is very disciplined, but nurturing at the same time. My daughter has truly come out of her shell and I thank Legacy Martial Arts for playing a big part in that. Other parents at Legacy Martial Art feel the same way! We have become one big family and it's the best. We hang out outside of the studio, with and without our children haha.

Legacy Martial Arts has fun community events such as Trunk or Treat, Parent's Night out,  Summer Picnic at the Beach, and Easter activities. They are very supportive to parent's needs and if you're having trouble with your child at home or school, they will provide support as needed.

The schedule of classes at Legacy Martial Arts is great and can fit any family's needs. Private lessons are also available. Their prices are affordable and have many coupons and offers if you'd like to to try it out. Legacy Martial Arts has adult programs for anyone who is interested, so the whole family can join!!

Each of the instructors brings something different to the school, and my daughter loves that there is a female instructor...girl power!

I am very happy at Legacy Martial Arts and can see our family continuing to be here for years to come. My 9 year old daughter is almost a Black Belt!!!<//text><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

<time>1390626988081<//time><Rating>5</Rating><Text>Let me begin by saying that Legacy Martial Arts and Family Fitness is, by far, the best martial arts school I have ever seen. It starts with the owner, Romeo Gregory, a taekwondo world champion with more than two decades of martial arts experience. It continues with his instructors, each of whom is also a world or state champion themselves.

While having talented martial artists teaching others is important, what really separates Legacy from other schools is the ability of Mr. Gregory and his talented team to transfer their superior skills and knowledge to others. This is a rare gift, which I have seen in few people.

My then seven year old son began studying under Mr. Gregory in early 2008, and subsequently became a state champion himself. While this is satisfying as a parent, what is more deeply satisfying to me are the life skills Mr. Gregory has helped instill in my son, as well as his other students. Life skills such as honor, integrity, loyalty, self control, and goals are not just words that are merely spoken, but are actually lived and given real meaning by the Legacy team. Not just concepts, but a way of life. I am very particular about who I allow to influence my son. I am happy that my son is a member of the Legacy family.

Lest you think Legacy Martial Arts and Family Fitness is just for kids, let me tell you, I have seen the lives of many adults changed as well. Whether it is learning martial arts or just losing weight through their "Combat Fitness" program, there is something for everyone here. Mr. Gregory has helped me lose 50 pounds myself, and has changed my life in a positive way. If you are looking for a place for your child or yourself to learn martial arts, or if you want to get going on a fitness plan, I wholeheartedly recommend that you check out Legacy Martial Arts and Family Fitness.<//Text>< Pictures>

Legacy Martial Arts is the best studio around if you want to become the best martial artist you can be. All the instructors teach you to the best of their ability and are so passionate about helping their students. They not only teach the proper techniques of tae kwan do, but also values such as courtesy, respect, perseverance, and self-confidence to their students. I do their traditional, hyper fight club, and trick school classes and am challenged every single class to achieve my best. I've been training with Legacy since 2013 and it's honestly one of the best decisions I've ever made. I'm currently a 1st degree black belt and receiving my black belt is my proudest achievement. I've also been competing the past 5 years and have achieved state and district titles with the help of Mr. Gregory, Ms. Rosales, Ms. Hess, and Mr. Ortiz. My next goal is to earn a World Title and my second degree black belt and I know they will help me in achieving these goals. Their dedication to their students is definitely amazing! I love training here and would not trade my experiences here for anywhere else.</review>

< Review>
I have been shopping for a Martial Arts studio for my 6 year old. I made contact with Legacy Martial Arts & Karate for Kids, was given their attempt at a HARD SALE on a start up special that segues into a VERY HIGH PRICED START UP COMMITMENT, and in my middle of asking innocent questions I heard a voice in the background say "he's not going to sign up, don't talk to him" at which point the sales man on the phone hung up! WTH!! Horrible way to treat a business that deals with children. I did some research. These guys are all about the money. There's no "Master" or person of notoriety. Just a hired on staff of barely qualified hands for hire who may or may not be equipped or qualified to mentor your child. Get a qualified referral before you sign up with yahoo studios like this one. Also, notice that half of the good reviews are from people who's kids don't go the Legacy, but "if" they "could". Most of these positive reviews are from friends and family members. Also, they talk about Master Gregory, but does he actually instruct? What a rip off.<//Review>

I was greeted by a nice guy who agreed to let me watch the lesson in session. He refused to answer my question regarding the cost for classes, and insisted I would be provided with this information after I take 2 trial classes, so they can asses my abilities and assign me to the "right  program".

The class I watched had several students and two instructors, both black belt dan 2. Some students definitely got personal attention and the rest are on their own, but the instructors level/forms were not impressive. Maybe they were having a bad day.

On the way out, the guy at the front desk asked if I want to sign up for the trial class. I was interested, but wanted to know what the tuition would be. I explained that I don't want to come for two trial classes if the tuition is beyond my budget. All he would say is that it would cost somewhere between $110-150/ month. When I asked how the tuition is calculated he repeated his whole spiel about the trial classes assessing what "program" I need. he could not explain what programs exist nor what the differences between them are.

I started to loose my patients. I was sensing a scam. It became clear to me that he wouldn't give the prices for a reason. I asked him if I can speak with the owners, since I don't think they would want to loose a client just because he wouldn't tell the prices. The guy behind the counter gave up at this point and summoned his co-worker who was overhearing the conversation. The second girl was more helpful, but still would not provide prices. Only after I told her I'd walk out if they don't cut the bull, the truth came out. Two lessons a week, cost $150/ month in a month by month payment plan! No wonder they were so fanatical about keeping this exorbitant price a secret. Who in their right mind would pay $150 at this place?!<//text>< Response>

When I asked how the tuition is calculated he repeated his whole spiel about the trial classes assessing what "program" I need. he could not explain what programs exist nor what the differences between them are.

I started to loose my patients. I was sensing a scam. It became clear to me that he wouldn't give the prices for a reason. I asked him if I can speak with the owners, since I don't think they would want to loose a client just because he wouldn't tell the prices. The guy behind the counter gave up at this point and summoned his co-worker who was overhearing the conversation. The second girl was more helpful, but still would not provide prices. Only after I told her I'd walk out if they don't cut the bull, the truth came out. Two lessons a week, cost $150/ month in a month by month payment plan! No wonder they were so fanatical about keeping this exorbitant price a secret. Who in their right mind would pay $150 at this place?!</Text>< user>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Review>Almost three years ago my son was turning 6, and all he wanted was to be a ninja. I contacted the closes studio to where we lived at the time and it was Legacy Martial Arts, I asked the owner Mr. Gregory if he would be able to have someone come out and do a presentation. He had never done anything like this but was open to the idea. It was one of the best birthday's my son had. Two instructors came out along with a group of kids, they put on a show and entertained our guest for a good 45 minutes, adults included. Before they left they gave my son a gift, his white uniform with a 30 day trial. After one week of classes my 9 year daughter decided she wanted to join too, a month later my 4 year old showed interest as well. All this took place summer of 2002, by the time my six year old went back to school his teachers noticed a difference in his behavior, they told me he had matured significantly during the summer break.
Now almost three years later, my three kids are still attending Legacy Martial Arts, there are other studios near our new home however we wouldn't change it for anything. My kids have learned self defense, leadership skills, they have overcome bullying, and continue to grow and learn after each class. I am one of the parents that sits during the classes, I see how each instructor brings their own unique teaching styles. While Mr. Gregory teaches classes the other instructors make sure the studio is running properly and everyone is taken care of.
My daughter who will be turning 12 has amazing leadership skills that have helped her at school, church and any where she goes. My almost 9 year old son loves hyper classes, it helps him use up all his energy on something positive. Also, all the moves keep his mind occupied. My 7 year old has more confidence that any 7 year old I know.
Two of my kids will be receiving their black belts before the end of this year. We are very proud of our kids and the decision we made of choosing Legacy Martial Arts.
I have recommended the studio to friends and family and will continue to do so.< /Review>< rating>

<Review>ATA Legacy Martial Arts is one of the finest martial arts schools in California.  Mr. Romeo Gregory and his staff are top-notched.  His students and families are very respectable and good people.   As a mother of 4, who has been in the martial arts industry for over 20 years, I highly recommend ATA Legacy Martial Arts!<//Review>< pictures>

For our son had been in many activities from football, baseball, guitar lesson, and more; however he always lost interest within 3-6 months. The instructors Mr. Gregory, Mr. Ortiz, Mr. Medina changed that! They not only taught him Taekwondo but life skills that he was sorely lacking. My son was a very reserved individual who would only speak when spoken too. Now we watch our son and are amazed by his transformation. Legacy Martial Arts has helped to mold him into a leader not only in class but in his life. He approaches life now as a confident, self assured individual. I would recommend Legacy Martial Arts to anyone who wishes for their child to thrive in life for these instructors teach a life style that will improve their lives in and out of the studio!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80e84ec23f94c07d:0xea7795550f445a30</gmap_id></record>

First off let me start by saying I've been known to be a picky parent when it comes to activities for my child. I have a daughter and son who we decided to put in Karate and both for different reasons. Our daughter Mikaela is full of energy and has difficulty following directions. We wanted her to learn focus to help her in school. She is in the Tigers (3-6) class and her instructor is incredibly patient with her. She has a good mixture of fun and discipline in her class. We also like how they allow the parents to be a part of the class helping our kids. My son Ben is the complete opposite. He is very introverted, keeps to himself, only likes video games. It's been a struggle to get him in any sports. We were more interested for him so he could possibly gain confidence. Ben was extremely reluctant to go because he initially thought he might get hurt. After a little convincing he tried the class a week after his sister and really enjoyed. His instructor made him feel special from the start. He gets a lot of attention even for a group class. The head instructor always makes sure he gets to him a few times each class. It's only been 2 months but his teachers are saying they are seeing a difference with him in his class participation and P.E. A few things my wife and I really like about Legacy is you get 4 classes per week in the basic program. Even though our kids are different ages their classes are back to back and with our work schedule it's convientent for us to drop off and pick up. The facility is clean and doesn't smell like a gym which is a huge plus. They have a lot of equipment for the kids to use. The last thing is they have been helpful when it comes to setting goals for Mikaela and Ben. They are involved building them into leaders and not just martial artist. We feel that postive direction and goal setting is very important for them. We are glad we found you. Thank you Mr. Gregory and Ms. Rosales!</review>

Legacy Martial Arts is place to be! I've met interesting people here at Legacy and I always have a good time training! The instructors here are focused to help one to reach their  goals and ambitions in martial arts and personal goals as well. I've seen unconfident, shy, aloof kids train here at Legacy Martial Arts with proper instruction and coaching that the instructors provide, the same kids dramatically change. Their confidence level soars, they become more social, and learn valuable life lessons. When you think you can't amount to much, here at Legacy Martial Arts, they provide you with that crucial push, that you can do it and that there's no limit to what you can do. I've trained here for 3 1/2 years and when I first began, I was unconfident, shy, and extremely introverted, almost to the point of concern.  Now, I am more confident in what ever I do, I even picked up some social skills, and I am becoming more increasingly extroverted and comfortable around people. Besides that, Legacy has proved to be the place to go if you want a good  workout routine, hands down. I say hands down because my first work at Legacy resulted in me having to crawl up my stairs because it hurt to much to use my legs. However, as time passed by, the classes were easier and my body was pushed to new limitations. I am in the best shape of my life as of now. To sum everything up and to state briefly; if you're pondering about enrolling yourself or your child in some type of martial arts, Legacy Martial Arts should be your first choice. You get your money's worth!</review>

My kids live too far away from this school to go to it, but the owner Romeo Gregory has guest taught at our school may times. He is a world champion in Taekwondo and a gifted athlete.  He is a no nonsense instructor who runs a very disciplined class and as such, can teach martial arts skills very rapidly. Many of his students do very will in the Taekwondo circuit willing state and world championships. The thing that really sets him apart from many is is really a caring person who always puts the kids interests above his own.  If I lived in his area I would not hesitate for a second to put my kids in his school.< /text>

Never thought my son would like tae-kwon-do.... But after the first day... I saw that he loves it... I have seen a big positive change in him.. The great teachers and staff at Legacy have made my sons experience into a new physical activity a fun journey and will keep taking him for years to come. "Dad I want to have a black belt" he told me so excited one day after practice with his teacher Miss. Rosales. I recommend everyone to bring their kids and meet the respectful staff.< /text>

<review>Wow I don't know where to start. First off I'd like to say thank you to Mr. Romeo Gregory, Jacob Medina, Eric Ortiz and Brooke Hess. They're superb instructors and are great motivators that have kept me going for over 9 years. i started at around the age of 4-5 years old and I'm still going at it because I would never trade this place for any other martial arts school. They treat everyone like family, they show you respect and make sure you are welcomed every day when you step foot into the school. Mr. Gregory has started from ground up putting dedication and hard work to this school. We are ranked high as one of the best schools in Cali and Mr. Gregory turns you into a Champion. This truly is the best place you could ever go to. #TeamLMA #StartStrongEndStrong #Legacy</review>< pics>

ATA Legacy Martial Arts is by far the best school in Ventura County. My kids started attending here 4yrs ago and I can never stop thanking my sister for introducing us to this place. During the time my kids first started attending, we were going through difficult changes in my family and I was afraid it would impact my kids in a negative way but thanks to Mr. Gregory, Mr. Medina and Mr. Ortiz, my kids were given something to look forward to when coming here. They were taught not only their forms, how to kick properly, and how to defend themselves but they were also taught, discipline, respect, pride, courage, perseverance, and other skills that they will need in order to be successful in life. I have never met a group of people who cared so much about their students and their families as Mr. Gregory and his staff do. I love the fact that they are very family oriented. They not only have classes for kids but also offer fitness classes for adults.As a single mother, I rarely had time for myself, I had joined gyms but could never go because I had my kids with me. I joined the fitness class at Legacy Martial Arts and because they are very family oriented, my kids are welcome to sit there work on homework or play with other kids while i workout. I can honestly say that this is like my second home. I encourage eveyone to give it a try and I promise that you will not be disappointed and you will thank me later!< /Review>

In Legacy Martial Arts Family Center the instructors not only teach martial arts, but also self-control, discipline, self-confidence, and respect for others. My three kids and I really love this school. They have programs for kids and adults such as Traditional Taekwondo, sparring, combat weapons, and hyper as well as combat fitness for those who really want to get in shape while learning kick boxing and self defense. The intructors, Mr. Gregory, Mr. Medina, Mrs. Rosales, and Mr. Navarro are excellent. I started training at Legacy Martial Arts around 10 months ago and my kids have been doing it for almost 18 months now.  As a matter of fact, I am a 35 years old guy without previous martial arts experience, so what's my point? That nobody is too old to start training at Legacy Martial Arts. Thank you Legacy Martial Arts for your hard work and your commitment toward creating a better future for our people, specially for our children. At Legacy Martial Arts, we are a family!!< /Review>

I am super timid and Legacy has been so welcoming that I am always happy to come to class instead of freaking out that people are there. Everyone is super motivating so your not just cruising through class everyone is pushing them selves trying to improve. They are not trying to hussle you they want to help you reach your best and keep getting better. After a little while  they will become like a second family. I am still sad that I will leaving for school soon since coming to class has become my favorite part of my day, but most of all I will be missing everyone. Legacy (LMA) is a wonderful community that is worth being a part of.< /text>

Legacy Martial Arts is no doubt the best studio in the area, with their superb team of instructors and excellent programs. I have been attending their combat fitness program and their adult traditional martial arts classes and it's not only helping me stay fit, but is also teaching me ways of defending myself if ever I was put in a dangerous situation. People of all ages learn a great deal of life skills aside from learning the art of Taekwando. I definitely recommend LMA because they make everyone feel welcome, offer a friendly atmosphere, and encourage everyone to not only grow as a martial artist but as a hard working, confident, and well respected person.<//review>

A bunch of arrogant and snobbish instructors. Their moto is that "You fake it until you make it" -  a very wrong  way to encourage a child this type of method. My child has been taking it literally. Anything she does are done without applying the "Fake it first" method and repeatedly done things incorrectly. I'd suggest they teach the child the proper systematic approach so that they do not have to fake things up in order to make things right. They seem to brainwashed the kids in so many ways including constant reminder of getting a black-belt and participation in Takewondo class in large group of participants on each sessions with very poor instructor ratio. This karate studio is a place of breeding guinea pigs. Maintained and operated by loud mouths and high confident (the fake it method) of instructors.<//Text>

If there were 10 STARS, I would DEFINITLY choose 10 stars ALL THE WAY!!!

My kids have attended Legacy Martial Arts since June of this year (2015). I have a 12, 9, & 4yrs. I enrolled my kids because my older daughter ( Jr. High student) was being bullied and got jumped at school. She was afraid for getting in trouble if she got in a fight. Unfortunately, she didn't have the correct tools to handle this horrible situation. I'm not for fighting but I am so for defending  ones self in time of need.

These past 2 months I have noticed that all my children have developed life skills that will be useful in the future; such like, confidence, self control, respect, integrity, perseverance and specially self-esteem. All of them enjoy coming to class. My oldest spends ALL day here. She has learned so much in so little time, thanks to the WONDERFUL INSTRUCTORS. She LOVES it so much that she even helps the younger classes and she is involved in a leadership program, as well as, a combat fitness class.

Mr. Gregory and his staff have treated all of us with so much respect. The are so AMAZINGLY AWESOME!!! From day 1 they welcomed us with open arms. They don't see us as a student. They see us as FAMILY! In order to be family we don't have to be blood related.

I SO recommend this place not just for kids, but for adults as well. So please tell ALL YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF LEGACY MARTIAL ARTS!!! THE BEST PLACE TO BE!!!<//review>

<Date>1415857862608< /Date><rating>5< /rating><Text>ATA Legacy Martial Arts & karate for kids is a great place to train at ihave been training here for the past 3 years and in that time i have earned a State Title in weapons and 3 District titles in Forms, Weapons, & Sparring. Things I have learned here have self control over myself, learned how to defend myself in different dangerous situations. Since I joined legacy martial arts i have noticed that i been being more appreciative of my parents. Also, i have been doing really well in my education. I have also noticed a positive change in my attitude. Before joining legacy martial i use to be a type of person who didn't interact with anybody. However, now i would say I'm a little more social and i try to interact with people. Finally, this is why legacy martial arts& karate for kids is a great place to train at and to get good life skills. Check it out it's made a big difference in my life.</Text>< pics>

I kind of forced my son to join Tae Kwon Do, at first he wasnt sure if he liked it or not. But after a few weeks he started to get into it. My daughter joined shortly after. After a year and a half of training they have improved so much. Not only in TKD but at school and their confidence have also improved so much.
The instructors are amazing, everyone is friendly and encouraging. The staff are the best, they are straight forward with everything. They are no longer just instructors to us, they have become our family. I highly recommend Legacy Martial Arts, you wont regret joining.< /text>

There are many great Karate schools in Oxnard, Ventura and Camarillo, but Legacy Martial Arts in Oxnard was the one that impressed. I wanted to find a program that could provide my 3 year old son an opportunity to exercise, have fun, and not to mention continue to learn about self control and focus. Unfortunately for us at the time, many karate schools did not accept students that young. I was willing to wait 6 months until he turned 4 and so my plan was to simply get a head start in my search for the best karate school for my son. I found Legacy Martial Arts online and found out they offer several programs appropriate for any age starting at age 3. My son and I visited the school, he took his first complimentary class and the rest is history. What I have come to admire and love about Tiny Tigers (3-6 years old) program was:

1. Verbal instructions as well as demonstration of movements by instructor are always clear, brief and appropriate for children 3-6 years old.
2. Parent participation. I wasn't expecting to participate at all but it is fun and a great way to learn how to help our children when they practice at home. No need to know karate, kids stand in several lines and we (adults) hold targets or pool noodles to provide students the opportunity to practice in class as much as possible (about 5-8 minutes). This also provides instructors time to go around to help and correct children.
3. Ms. Rosales, the Tiny Tigers instructor, reviews numbers, name of animals, body parts, explains key terms and vocabulary, asks for clarification, reviews sequences and patterns, and uses choral response during class.
4. No memorization is needed, students build and put forms together by working on individual steps and movements.
5. Finally, I especially love and appreciate the collaborative support of other instructors and of that of older karate students during Tiny Tigers class. Tiny Tigers always have the instructor and at least one more person helping in every class.

If I am impressed by this class alone, I can only imagine the quality of instruction and support other students get in their respective program and level!

It has been 5 months and my husband and I as well as the rest of the family, have seen an overall improvement in my son. I have come to like this school so much that as of last week I became a member of their Hyper Fight Club. I love the energy and camaraderie as well as the work out and the support I get from all of the instructors. I'm looking forward to reaching my health and fitness goals.

I want to thank Mr. Gregory, Ms. Rosales, Mr. Medina, as well as the rest of the staff and the many families that make Legacy Martial Arts a GREAT and AMAZING martial arts school.</text>

Too much curriculums and requirements that are only use for a short time. Proper forms and techniques are not being taught here consistently per lessons, leading to punching/kicking learning process in total imperfections among the students in different levels. Your child will not learn the traditional teaching of Taekwondo here since the teaching and curriculums has been redesigned to revolutionized the sequence of learning Taekwondo from the norms which geared towards for the purpose of making money.<//Review>

Romeo Gregory is the shizzle for rizzle.  He does kicks like the karate kid on steroids while smoking crack on a trampoline.  This place rips.  I would put all of my kids in his classes if I had any in the area.  Legacy Martial Arts is by far the best martial arts studio in Southern California.  If you don't believe me, go look at his high flying acrobat students and all of the World Champ insignias on the backs of their uniforms.  If you live in Oxnard and want to be like Ryu or Ken, go to LMA and get your workout on.< /review>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Legacy Martial Arts has been a phenomenal experience for my family! I truly believe in what they teach everyday; loyalty, perserverence, integrity and most of all Respect. My son, Jake, started at the age of 6 and we have not looked back. He is now 12 years old and with the patience and dedication of his instructors he finally received his 2nd degree black belt this past summer! It has taught him that ANYTHING & EVERYTHING is possible. Their instructors believe in their students and FOCUS on all their positive attributes. He is becoming a very respectful young man (which i am very proud) and has helped him with school. He is a GATE student and all his training has helped him keep focused on all his school work. Just the other day he held the door open for a couple walking into a restaurant. The lady said to us that it was very nice to see a young man show chivalry now a days. I strongly recommend Legacy Martial Arts to everyone! As for myself, their team also believe in ME. I have committed myself to their excellent COMBAT FITNESS program for the past two years and i have never felt this good!! I have reached my goals and continue to strengthen my body everyday. The results are awesome and i love it when people think i look twenty-something with two kids, WOW!! Bye bye to my back pain and hellooooo to feeling great! Their program itself never lets you give up and i assure you
NO Gym will give you the results you are looking for. Family oriented, indeed! You want a personal trainer for a whole session? I guarantee this is the program you need. Many THANKS to Legacy Martial Arts :) - Sarah, Jake & Linny Perez<//Text>< pictures>

The cashiers here and the supervisor of the self checkout lanes are honestly so rude - and especially and only to people of color. Moreover, they always seem impatient with customers and when people need assistance at self checkouts, we have to patiently wait for the employees to finish their conversations. I once saw a lady try to interrupt them and get help at the self checkout station and the blonde worker literally raged at her during work. Unacceptable service, these people at the checkout lines need training.<//Text>

Always friendly staff and full of fresh produce. Their deli and salad bar section is always stocked and fresh. They're "butcher" section has a variety of marinated meat, chicken and seafood to choose from.  A big selection of organic food and ready to eat packs.

A good selection of beer and wine, but they are not BevMo.  Pricing can be competitive, but don't count on bargain pricing.

The flower department has a big fresh selection of flowers and it's always staffed for custom bouquets.

Finally don't forget the Asian section with a variety of popular trendy and current Asian food. Again, the price can be competitive, but do not count on finding bargains.<//text>

Is your company training white salespersons to drive Chinese out like animals?  Will the technique of throwing the customer's invoice directly on the ground be rewarded in your company?  If you are not willing to do Chinese business, you can post a notice at the door. We Chinese are not like going to your company to spend money to buy humiliation.< /text>

Great staff.  Great grocery store.  They do their best to stay in stock.  Jamba Juice is delicious.  Their habanero baked chicken is delicious.
Their Panda Express is better than all the Panda Express locations, for some reason.  I'm saying this as someone who doesn't like Panda Express. 😁<//Text>

Masks required for employees and customers. Clean. Friendly employees. They have separate entrance and exit doors. Clean carts after each use. Bonus...they have a Starbucks :)< /Review>

I love this location. It's my local grocery store. I love the staff! And it is usually stocked when I go in the morning. I think they're doing the best they can during these trying times. They have a wonderful cleaning crew that is constantly hustling during these crazy times.</Review>

Great selection. I found a banana split ice cream birthday cake that the kids loved. I also love Vons for their fresh produce.</Review>

Love the store, but the supervisor older lady with long grayish/blonde hair is one of the rudest managers I've come across. I would suggest upper management sending here to get alot more training on her people skills.</Review>

Staff are very friendly and kind. Lots of parking spaces. The only reason I gave 4 stars not 5 is because they have lack of organic products. It's getting better tho. Hope they have more organic products rapidly.<//text>

This review is for the pharmacy only.  Ms. Like What, the pharmacy clerk either has limited English, or is indifferent for providing ANY customer service.  She has no idea what I was saying, or was NOT listening AT ALL!  Upon obtaining my prescription, she told me "wait for 30 minutes".  I asked politely, "would you please check whether you have it first?". I was then informed that they need to order it and have me pick it up on Monday.  Then she went to the inside counter and started doing other things.  I waited until she saw me again and said "I told you the pick up date is Monday, just call before you come".  I was very uncomfortable and asked "would you please set me up for the text alert?"  She said yes and went to do something else again.  I stood at the counter for another 3 minutes until she noticed me and said something again.  I reminded her that I am still waiting for her to set me up.  She finally did after a total of about 10 minutes.  I have done similar processes at other branches of Vons and it took less than 2 minutes, they really need to ramp up their customer service quality!< /Text>

Lol the Vons Easter bunny at the Easter egg hunt for kids. 🐰 This Vons is huge. Super clean and stocked. Lines move fast. Self checkouts available. Wells Fargo atm inside. Stamps, check cashing available. Starbucks, Jamba Juice inside, Panda Express inside.</review>

<Review>Plenty of parking, good selection of fruit & veggies, great selection of everything grocery-wise you might need. Basic greeting cards, wrapping paper (if you need that type of thing), party items. They have ethnic foods as well, keeping in mind their local shoppers. There's a Starbucks and Jamba Juice in there, as well as a pharmacy and a small dry-cleaner service. They also sell lottery tickets, if I'm not mistaken (human, not machine).<//Review><user_name>Mrs Pallas<//user_name><user_id>102102494336624915982<//user_id><rate>5<//rate></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>2</Rating><Review>This place is ok for what itis now.  Selection and services is fine. The reason for this rating is what they are compared to what they were. Before, they were Pavilions. They are still the same company but it was so much more special. They use to treat people special and were more outgoing and friendly. That really made a difference and I notice it. All stores could be alot more but itisnotdueto store policy and training. Too Bad. Loyalty goes both way and is earned.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>This place is completely anti Mexican I walked in to buy Panda Express and the service there was very good but upon walking out I was being followed by staff as if I was stealing something. They made me feel very uncomfortable and I didn’t even notice it until my wife and daughter pointed it out. Is this what America is?? I’m an America citizen and pay my taxes.

<text>My 5⭐'s is for the wonderful Bakery Department...Christina and Peggy were an 'Absolute Joy" to talk and ask all my questions to!
Thanks ladies! It's employees like you who keep customers like me coming back to your Vons...I come from El Monte area for your delicious Bagles! Fresh daily,and those jalapeno and cheese bagels are AMAZING,covered with tons of cheese and plenty of jalapenos,and their opens at 6am!
This Vons Bakery is Awesome! With a beautiful store, inside they have a Starbucks, Panda Express, and many other places inside that I can't even think of right now... but it's an awesome Vons! 🎉 Fresh produce,flowers and plants,stuffed animals balloons cards...they sell  everything you want for a birthday gift...a great Deli with fresh hot soups and I just LOVE their bakery!
A must try if your ever in Arcadia!<//text>< Pics>

Nice. Clean store. Plenty of parking spaces.  Prices may not be the lowest compared to other (Asian or Mexican) markets nearby, everything appears sparkly  clean here. P.s. friendly staff, too.</Review>

Fairly large newer-style Vons with many extra departments, even a drive through pharmacy. Parking is free but can be crowded at busy times. You pay for the large variety in prices that are not great overall. Sale prices can be good if you use a Club card account and the Vons app. Best to shop here if you plan what to buy before you visit. Staff are helpful when asked.< /review>

Terrible cashier, rude attitude. Woman cashier at 15 items over must had a bad day, she was unprofessional and ready to explode with mean attitude because I didn't have Vons club card. I'm saying sorry and all that, but she is continously getting mad and being annoy.  My over 100 times shopping experiences at Ralph's have always encounter superb cashiers. I will try best not to shop at Vons again<//Text>

I've been to this location 4 times within 24 hours. Each time I was able to successfully purchase items. It's confusing because they have a sign on a side of the building without any doors. There is also a panda Express within the location. They mostly sell grocery items, but other items can also be purchased here. Prices are mid to high range.<//review>

<Name>J. C.</Name><date>1510087171181</date><rate>4</rate><Review>Vons is actually a great supermarket. They have a deli, hot food case, sandwich deli area, prepackaged foods from the deli, fresh produce, organics, a florist, dry cleaner, lotto vendor, Jamba juice, panda express, Starbucks, sushi makers, pharmacy, bakery +++ this store is very clean and the staff can be friendly. There are some grouchy people but not enough to discourage me from visiting this store. You can actually get flowers cheaper at trader Joe's than you can here. From what I heard the pharmacy is kind of pricey. Also the parking lot is absolutely the worst feature. Be extra careful because it can be hazardous with people not paying attention. That said, I use to live around the corner and always walked to Vons. My biggest criticism is that they never replaced their bike rack. It was destroyed by a driver and ultimately removed. So if you're thinking about stopping in it is worth it. Try a low flow hour because they no longer have their self check out and peak times are crazy with long lines. My favorite items are the carousel ice cream cakes and the giant hello kitty balloons.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2dba591fc9b59:0x4d0cfc63412bd434</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I used to love shops at Pavilion. Ever since Albertsons bought it! Everything not the same anymore. I thought I'm the only person who felt the difference, my co-workers said they're shopping at Vons or Pavilion as well!<//review>

<text>I was in the store that I have shopped in, almost exclusively since it opened, years ago.  There was a woman ahead of me who came back to the lane I was in, in front of me, to take issue with a price she was charged for some meat.  The two packages were obviously different, probably from different providers.  I get that, but this lady didn't, or appeared not to understand, and was determined to get the better price.  After much confusion with several employees involved, including a manager, the woman got what she wanted.  What I and the people behind me in line got was very a long wait.  I came very close to leaving my groceries, and just walking away.

My question,  what is the customer service desk for???  Any time I have had issue with a purchase, that is where I have been told to go.  My time was of no value here and I have had it happen too many times.  I will be a customer of the Pasadena Ralphs store from this point.</text>< pics>

<Text>This has got to be one of the most versatile grocery stores that I have ever been to. I mean, they have a Panda Express, a Jamba Juice, a Starbucks, an amazing deli, a bakery, and more! It's crazy. All the staff that I've encountered here are incredibly polite and the store itself is really clean. They even have bag carryout service for those who are physically impaired. All around this is a great store.< /Text><Rate>5< /Rate>< UserId.>

My favorite Von's Pavillions! Very clean. Very customer service oriented. Friendly and great service by cashiers, deli and bakery, and all other departments. Feels like small town hospitality.  Great specials on Friday!</Text>

One of the bigger Vons store. Used to be Pavilion and they rebranded / downgraded to Vons. The store still have Panda Express, hot rotisseries, hot meats, Starbucks (with chairs, tables and sofas), dry clean and Jamba Juice. The store are nice and clean. Many different kind of fruits and vegetables. .  Staff are friendly but checkout could be ling wait.< /Review>

Great deals sometimes, but food can be pricey in comparison to cheaper stores. It's really clean and they have good selections for standard american foods. They have their own little overpriced asian section which is kinda good if you're in a rush.<//Review>

One of the bigger super markets in the area. Produce are fresh, big selection. The Panda Express, Jamba juice,  Starbucks are convenient should you feel like meals after shopping.</review>

Slow service in the store and prices and deals don't seem to be as great as other Vons I've been to. They have a lot of unique selection for Asian Americans though. Not my favorite Vons by any means. Waiting in line will be the bulk of the time in the store most likely.<//review>

Very friendly cashiers and manager.

The deli section took a bit longer to serve me than I'd like. Wholefoods and trader Joe's will give you more attentiveness but it's not too bad here.

Manager here will go above and beyond for you!<//Review>

<text>I'm not from around here, passing through visiting California. First time in this store (no Vons in Illinois) and I the cashier was too busy texting on his Facebook messenger to pay attention to me. On 3 different occasions he stopped ringing my items so he can write on the messenger app. Great first impression.<//text>< response>

Staff looks like they are dying inside, the food is kind of over-priced, you cant get deals unless you are a member and yeah. Not the best experiance. There is a lot of room for improvement.</review>

Love this Pavillion (now back to Vons). Selections of different foods; fresh bread, grade a meats and veges. Pharmacy is helpful and reasonably quick. Also love the options of Jamba Juice and Starbucks in the store. The only two complaints are lack of self service check out lines which it used to have and wait time to drop off and pick up dry clean since they lump this service with lotto/returns/cashier checks. Favorite employee is mr. Mohammed.</Text>

<Review>Relatively clean store, nice and accommodating staff. Wide variety of goods at a fair price. Only problem is lack of cashiers at times.

Theres also a starbucks inside even though theres another (official) starbucks right next door to it.< /Review>< Rating>

<Date>1525742296771< /Date><user>101466442122096967700< /user><text>What impressive about this particular Vons is that their fresh produce section is at the front of the store. Most and any other store would have them at the far side or even at the back of the store. So, when I come it, it just feels nice, healthy and open - it doesnt feel crowded at all.
I have been coming in to this store for about a 3 years now, and a lot has changed.
I love that they accept google and apple pay. You can also use those means to pay for your orders at their in-house Jamba Juice and Starbucks. PROTIP: you can pay for your groceries from these outlets, too.
The only one disappointing thing they did which i had wished they kept were the self check out counters; because most of the time, i just go in for 1 or 2 things, and i didnt have to wait in like to pay. These supposed express checkout lanes that replaced the self checkout counters are empty most of the time, and it appears that its just a place to keep returned items to be placed at the end of the day. So, what should just be a quick pick up, becomes several minutes waiting in line at a counter for someone to finish counting change to pay in exact amount.

Other than that, the manager is very friendly when i had inquired about a favorite drink they havent restocked - they restocked it!! - and it sells out fast. - they however havent been restocking or having the party tray mini rolls or the croissants anymore, which is my most frequent buy from there a couple years back, but still - their fresh items are great, and its conveniently surrounded by other shops where you can eat, drink or shop at while a friend or family member is restocking your home's supplies.<//text><rating>4<//rating>< Pictures>

Raw fish is old, avocado is black. Mostly i cant return sushi sp better taste first before pay for it. Afc sushis not cheap so if ypu buy nasty okne that cant be eayen, thr ow away costs 15 bucks! Just put it back for them. After 7p I'm surprised they still sell those old sushi at regular price!
Rip off sushi place

Other than bad overrated sushi and some fake over priced organic fruits and vegetables, they're ok.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>Very poor. I know it is Saturday afternoon but really not a 16.9 oz. Diet Pepsi in the store,  the  buy 4 ads were out or unmarked,  even the produce was picked over! Plus to get a rain ckeck you have to go clear over to customer service & wait for someone to show up to write it for you. I'm a regular shopper at the store & have noticed lack of service decline & right now I don't care if I ever go back.</text><GmapID>0x80c2dba591fc9b59:0x4d0cfc63412bd434< /GmapID><user>103376293610202920995< /user><Rate>1< /Rate><Time>1516505544659</Time>< pictures>

<rate>1<//rate><resp>None<//resp><Time>1622407430406</Time><review>(Translated by Google) Compatriots be careful! There are racists among the salespersons in this shop. They have treated the Chinese people badly during the epidemic. They deliberately find faults, treat the Chinese people who are queuing to check out like driving animals, and even deliberately throw my invoices on the ground. Nearby Chinese residents try not to go shopping here, there is no need to spend money to buy humiliation. I have thrown away my membership card, there is no need to go again.

同胞小心！此店营业员中有种族主义分子，在这个疫情时期对待中国人态度恶劣，故意找茬，像是驱赶动物一样对待排队结账的中国人，甚至故意把我的发票扔在地上。附近中国人居民尽量不要去这里购物，没有必要去花钱买屈辱。我已经扔掉了我的会员卡，没必要再去了。< /review><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

Panda Express, Starbucks coffee shop, flower shop, etc. are all in the business. A variety of operations are convenient for customers. The cashier ’s friendly attitude gives me an impression. it is good.
