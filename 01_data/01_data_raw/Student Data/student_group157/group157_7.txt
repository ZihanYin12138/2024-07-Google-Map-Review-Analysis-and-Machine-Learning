Nurse practitioner Sunny Bush has been an incredible support system on my medication journey. Working with her and her office has always been safe, positive, and efficient. They are thorough and attentive and Sunny is undeniably the kindest and most helpful pill doctor I ever could have imagined. I found this office through an insurance referral and couldn’t be more grateful.<//text>

The professional I work with is great. I feel that I am supported and I am happy with my care. I offered 4 stars instead of 5 because the Front Desk seems to have problems answering and/or returning calls.
They also have issues passing messages to the correct care providers.</Text>

Dr. K really takes care of my husband.  We know he is very busy and appreciate that he spends so much time reviewing all of Dan’s questions and concerns.

We recently started working with Jessica, one of the specialists.  She’s very thorough and we appreciate the time she’s spending on Dan’s case.<//text>

This is difficult to share as it’s personal, but I am so very grateful for all the help, guidance and support I received from Marina at Siyan.   She was firm, but kind and held me accountable to do my part. Together we transformed my situation which was desperately needed.   I feel much more hopeful and optimistic now.  She is professional and highly experienced, and uses a tough love approach which for me was needed.  I feel so fortunate to have found her and Siyan.   I strongly recommend this place. We all need a little help and support about now.  Thank you Siyan!!< /Text>

I have seen a psychiatrist at this location and am currently undergoing TMS treatment. The gals that run this program are soooo kind and wonderful! I actually look forward to it! The front desk gals are also really nice :)

I thought I could leave another review but I cant so I am just going to add to my original one.
It is such a hard journey seeking help with mental health issues. My journey has been long and hard, but this clinic has not given up on me. Every single person has shown me kindness, even when calling the front desk their voices are cheery. This helps me keep going on this journey of healing. I am so grateful for their patience, knowledge, and care.<//review>

My weekly visits with Dr. Jeannie, lift me out of darkness, giving me tools to see the gifts in my life and live a full and peaceful life.

Getting help from the Clinic several years ago literally changed my life..saved it is an appropriate adjective too.  Dr. Shah evaluation, the CBT class he recommended and my years of counseling with Dr. Jeannie have been beyond amazing in the help and tools they have given me.  Barbara Farrell has been so efficient in checking with me about my medications.
And your front desk staff are so helpful, patient and pleasant.
Siyan Clinic deserves more than 5 stars.<//text>

I was going through an incredibly difficult time and every where I called - no one could help me - either because they were not taking more patients or only couples or a variety of other reasons.

Siyan called me back the same day and their kindness helped me to know there was hope for me to get help.

Since there Marina has been there for me and helped me try to get back on my feet.<//review>

I’ve been a patient at this clinic for years and they never cease to amaze me. I also work in healthcare with an expertise in patient experience and can say that Siyan clinic is consistently exceptional and Dr. K is amazing. I’ve experienced a lot of hardship in the last several years including the 2017 fires call and am thankful for Dr. K helping me through these times. Thank you to everyone at Siyan Clinic.<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>A positive report on Dr. Desai.
Dear Siyan, Dr. Desai was nice and welcoming to me and she is smart. She took care of me and was always careful to make sure my medications didn’t interact with each other in a bad way. She was nice to allow my mom to come to my appointments and was in charge of the dosages of my medications. Dr. Desai also took my input seriously. She was not too serious and she is relatable through her more basic psychology training vs her doctoral medication education. Also, I want to say that I ran into Dr. Desai and her very young son at my work at Trader Joe’s and it was obvious that she is nice towards her patients in public and not too short, and she also respected my confidentiality. Thank you, Dr. Desai. My mom and I wish you the best.

<text>I am incredibly proud to be apart such a passionate team. Siyan has grown to be more than just a providers office but focused on the patient experience, continues to expand services, and more involved in the community everyday. I was NOT asked to write this review. I just want to speak my honest opinion and reflect on my perception, internally. Our providers  and Admin are extremely genuine, even internally they are kind and professional. As one of the project coordinators, I can gladly say I am directly involved and always listening to our patients, improving, expanding and making our patients experience as comfortable as it can be.</text><GmapID>0x8084381253a5433f:0x191aa92c2587aa0e< /GmapID><pictures>None</pictures><Date>1566587203300<//Date><Rating>5< /Rating><name>Amanda Anello<//name><UserId.>106371066347446675132<//UserId.>< response>

<Text>Dr Shah is an incredible person for having found this place. Siyan Staff and Project Hope are amazing! They are truly dedicated to helping people, and making sure you feel at home. They are kind and understanding, and have bent over backwards to accommodate me. I have also been seeing them going on three years!  As an addict I can say these people have saved my life and taught me skills that I can use day to day. Thank you Tiffany, Tomas, and Ronie for all that you do, I  wouldn't be here without you ❤️ Also thank you front desk ladies! You are organized, professional, and most of all very kind, patient, and understanding 👍❤️ I also love how staff decorates for holidays!!!</Text><gmapID>0x8084381253a5433f:0x191aa92c2587aa0e<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Terry Drew is a god send and 5 stars simply doesn't do justice to simply how amazing she truly is! What do I mean? I could rattle on about my 3 visits but there isn't enough room on this review to rant and rave about their level of patient to doctor level of comfort they provide (and let's be honest- no one want to read more than 3 sentences which I have already passed). I will say this however; if you want a real person who doesn't BS and talks and treats the patient like a real person without games or nonsense, Dr. Drew is the Doctor for you! Again, 5 stars aren't enough, this professional level of service from a professional provider deserves 6 star at least!!</Text>

I have had the pleasure of working with the team at Siyan Clinical Research on their medication assisted treatment program called Project Hope.

The team at Siyan Clinical go above and beyond to understand each patient's individual psychiatric needs and provides them with an effective treatment plan in a supportive, compassionate environment.

They deserve more than five stars for their services. While I hope you or a loved one never need their assistance, if you do, Siyan Clinical Research should be your first choice.</text>

< Review>
As a recent former employee who worked at Siyan Clinical for 3 years, I can hands down say it was the most rewarding, lovely and beneficial place I have ever worked.  From my collaborating MDs and the entire team, the collegiality made it fun to go to work with a sense of purpose and enjoyment. In a field treating persons with suffering or life challenges, the importance of a positive uplifting environment and team really matter.  The support and technology for seeing patients and charting was streamlined. The mission and service to the community was always growing and progressive. The respect from the collaborating MDs and team and everyone’s interest in learning as well made for a dynamic milieu.  I furthermore fully realized upon leaving Siyan that the benefit package was highly competitive and with profit sharing added nicely to my retirement funding. For anyone wondering about a career with Siyan Clinical, I highly recommend a positive working experience and relationship with the team as well as the clientele. Thank you for the opportunity to be a part of Siyan Clinical.  Terri Drew<//Review>

<review>I've been coming here since April 2018. I go for mental health services, medication management, and Suboxone maintenance. Everyone here has been kind, understanding, and has treated me fairly.  As far as the maintenance program goes, I've followed their guidelines to the best of my ability with an understanding that if I don't, then I cannot be a part of that program. I've been doing great with their help!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I was having a terrible experience w another clinic in Santa Rosa (SRTP). I found siyan and have never looked back. I am 7 years in recovery and have found such support. My counsellors Tiffany and Keri are super awesome and smart. They get me, and sometimes that's all you really want.

Thank you to entire Siyan staff in Santa Rosa. I encourage anyone struggling to make your way there, you will find relief.< /review>

<Text>So I have a team of three amazing people here at siyan (project hope) Kari is an exceptional case manager who is dedicated determined and compassionate. She goes above and beyond helping with everything from anxiety to the more practical things like scheduling much needed medical appointments. Ever since coming to siyan clinical my life has made a huge turn around. Amanda the project coordinator is provides excellent help as well and is always very welcoming. Tiffany the nurse practitioner is thorough, kind, and never judgmental. I always feel safe here and it’s a great place to go for healing. Project hope saved my life. Huge thanks to siyan clinical and the team.</Text><Rating>5</Rating><name>Daniel T< /name>< user_id>

<Text>Unfriendly, cold and rude. Never smiling. Isn’t this supposed to be a place for mental health services? If the patient walks out feeling worse than when they walked in, I fail to see how this group is helpful. I dreaded every single visit. Thank God Jesse fired me today. I probably should have done it myself sooner. I don’t think I am overreacting, but in a little kindness would have gone a long way. If all you want is medically assisted treatment, just go in there like a robot and you’ll be fine. If you’re looking for kindness and warmth and support, find another place.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Date>1531340946962< /Date>< user_name>

<review>I have been seeing Teri Drew for over a year now, I have been treated with respect from the first day from both the staff and clinicians. I was initially asked by my doctor to come here for psychiatric meds as it is very tough for a medical doctor to prescribe these now that the opiod epidemic has started :( I sort of came begrudgingly, but since my health insurance was willing to foot the cost (except for a $40 copay) I decided I would go and make things easier for my doctor. I am so happy I made the decision to come in, not only have I experienced great advise and counseling, Teri has really helped me (partnered with me) to make the best decisions I can make regarding medication and life decisions, she is very knowledgeable with meds, side effects and what works with what. I can honestly state that this is the best I have felt (I am 55), my depression is non-existent, my anxieties are manageable now and my sleep cycles are returning. Teri was not forceful with her advise which helped me excel, I think she knows when you need a little push and will give that if needed, but mostly I feel this is a partnership allowing me to feel the best I can about my life! I want to state again, I have had nothing but positive attitudes from everyone I have met at Siyan and appreciate everyone from the front desk staff, to my doctor, to the doctor that filled in for her and helped me with my meds while she was away on vacation...I would definitely suggest this business to anyone that has the need! :)
I have met now with one of the other clinicians and she is terrific as well! They are doing tele visits now and that is very helpful during Covid, though their office is immaculate and they have loads of Covid protections in place.
I am also now meeting with Carrie and she is also wonderful and has many good ideas on how to curb anger and depression. I will continue to work with her on these items and many more. The staff at Siyan are all wonderful, very wonderful and helpful!<//review>< Pics>

< review>
I have been coming to Siyan for a long time now. For mental health reasons -severe depression. I come here five days a week for TMS treatment. The staff here go out of their way to make sure you are taken care of and they joke with you as well. It pained me to see the last review from the Angelica person. Because I am pretty sure she is a past disgruntled employee. She speaks ill of Andy and Rhonda. The two front desk people that have been there for a long time. Both of them know my name and call me by name when I come in  and treat me like family. The so called one good girl that used to work there? She couldn't get off of her phone to look up and greet me when I walked in. I stood there in front of her for several minutes one time and she finally looked up from texting and said "man problems right?"  I do not know what she was talking about nor do I want to. Not a fan. This place is very professional in how they treat you. I love Jullianna, Katrina, and Laurie as well. The billing people Briana and Helen are also great at explaining your bills and how your insurance works. I have seen the front office staff have some upset patients come in and they handle them with kindness and politeness. If you have a mental health need then this is a great office to come to get help. The staff and doctors go out of their way to be kind to you.</review>

<Review>You'll get a full appointment if I don't run out of stuff to talk about. Prompt next day appointments which is rarw, and helpful. The front desk receptionist had black jagged sharpened to a point nails so I was very wary of Making sure to have her drop my change in my hand and grab the paperwork on the other end. I think for a place with a million rules and boasting properness, the death metal gouge your eyes out nails were inappropriate. Maybe appropriate for a dive bar. Thanks.< /Review>< pictures>

<text>This is the most least helpful place- I have the most absolute worst experience ever trying to even understand what their rules, protocols, etc were but the office people who state they don't make the decisions actually wasted over an hour an a half of my time with gathering and calling back and based on almost no information whatsoever stated they couldn't help the person- based on next to no information. On top of it, the worst of it, I am a Executive professional, I deal with people all day, some difficult and have never felt so demeaned by anyone. It was very "beat around the bush" evasive answers that were to not state assumptions clearly made about how a number of people were not good enough for their services; after being told that an appointment could be made suddenly it could not be. When someone needs help with this type of treatment, a little kindness, 'bedside manner', some level of respect that the person is a human being is IMPORTANT. I get not wanting to say the straightforward, honest thing because you're afraid someone could take it as judgement but that would've been far better that what I experienced. This was the most least professional, disrespectful exchange I can recall having since I worked in hotels 15 years ago. In an attempt to try to help others I ended up losing important hours of my day and ended up feeling like I now need a therapist. I had recommended this entity before I HIGHLY recommend against it now.  I feel they might actually make you worse off then when you came in- or tied to...</text><Name>Sunny Mountain< /Name><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Time>

< Review>
I was Treated to Very Cruel, Unfair Standards. I'm recovering from Cancer and they Cut My Account. They really made my life Much Worse. There are other people getting services from them that are no where near as Sick as I am but they still get service!  Why?
My skin is too light!
I'm Native American!  A Curse on them!<//Review>

I don't recommend someone use this company, they don't responsible to costumer reserving schedules,  the paratransit van always delay time, sometime no show up, and needs to call many times, but still delay around 1 to 2 hours, or no van show up to pick you up, beside that representative is very rough while you making the appointment. Today, my mom returned time at 1:00pm from dialysis center, no one pick her up, then I called 4 time, she waited until 3:00pm, still no van show, finally, she needed to walk a long distance to the bus stop to take bus. Very bad service.<//Text>

<Review>Very rude driver works for SF Paratransit. Yesterday, 10/27/14 at 3:45pm, I was changing lanes and this dark skinned overweight SF Paratransit driver (with License plate 1366074) starts honking at me, like I cut her off. Maybe she wasn't paying attention but I signaled for at least 5 secs and waited for a long gap to merge into her lane. I called their company to complain and the reception told me that their get a lot of complaints. The reception forwarded me to the complaint department but I couldn't leave a message because it hung up on me. I would not trust my elder friends and family here!</Review><gmap_id>0x8085809e6db0bafd:0xa173888c639a0409</gmap_id><Rate>1<//Rate><userid>114276736308966795274< /userid><Response>None</Response>< name>

This Service Abandons its Customers
Over the past 4 months I have received a couple dozen calls regarding arranging a ride for SF Paratransit customer Gwendolyn Dedmond.  Only problem is, I am not Gwendolyn and have never met her.  Each time I tell the dispatacher this fact.  The dispatcher tells me there is nothing they can do and I have to call the main office.  So I dutifully called the main office and the utterly disorganized person there said she would look into it.  However I still get calls for Gwendolyn Dedmond -- weeks later.  So this is only a minor nuisance for me.  But poor Gwendolyn must be still waiting for her ride!< /Text>

I went there for paratransit assistance. The office itself, on the 1st floor, has a large waiting room. But it appears that parking is very difficult nearby. Be forewarned.< /review>

Simplify and Move was able to organize and mobilize a quick and efficient transition for my dad in his difficult time.  They evaluated the space he was moving into, met with us to understand what items were important, and created with space planning that felt like a set decorated movie set that captured all the emotional elements that re-created the emotional feeling of his previous home with the goal of making the new space feel familiar.

<rate>5<//rate><review>Working with Cori has been a joy and has given me sanity!  We have systematically de-cluttered and organized every room in my house, garage and basement. After completing the house, we then organized 20+ years of memorabilia and photos for my 3 kids and husband.  Everything is placed into manageable sized boxes and albums, which everyone in the family has thoroughly enjoyed.

In addition to my house in Los Angeles, Cori travelled to Mammoth, CA to work the same magic at our vacation home. She helped me get rid of carloads of unwanted gear and make every closet and drawer beautifully organized, labelled and a pleasure to open.

Throughout these projects Cori has been incredibly easy to schedule and work with. She has wonderful ideas about how to tackle and implement a project and is laser focused on helping you complete your goals. Cori works hard and quickly.  She is always thorough, finding solutions for your storage needs, clearing away the clutter and delivering all your unwanted items to a donation center at the end of each session.  She has scheduled Salvation Army and City of LA large bulky item pick ups, as well as other creative solutions for items that still have life in them.

Cori is always upbeat, professional, discreet and fun to work with. Her rates are reasonable and I couldn’t recommend her more highly!</review></record>

<Text>Simplify+ Move LA was just that except I did not move. Cori and Sharon came for a full day and redid my kitchen. It was hard to believe how much stuff I had accumulated over 18 years in my kitchen, because we threw out half a dumpster full of stuff and donated  6 boxes worth of stuff. The best thing was when I woke up the next morning and came downstairs it was like some elves came in and rearranged my whole kitchen TO BE FUNCTIONAL FOR ME!  To start, Cori suggested a shelving unit be installed to create extra space, as my kitchen is small.  All the huge appliances I have like my air fryer and slow cooker now live in this shelving unit, with all my alcohol, as before my kitchen counters were COVERED.  Now they are CLEAR (who knew what my counters looked like before??!!)   I have new drawer dividers- and everything has a place!!  Containers and lots of Lazy Susan’s-  a job well done!!  This definitely changed my life (I LOVE TO COOK!) and I’m gonna have them back to do my entire house.  I’m hooked!  I think they should rename their company to SIMPLY THE BEST💪💪💪.  Worth every penny!!

<Review>Cori has the ability to see order in chaos and help you focus on what you need and get rid of what you don't.  My closet and laundry room/pantry were cluttered and not very functional, and after her "magic" time at my house, I can find everything so much more easily.  She is professional and works quickly and she's fun to be around!  It is transformational; the literal and figurative weight that is lifted when you are organized.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdDWqzELjvm4ZSa5YjrjOqUNYqkvf33M6rSEZg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZamzTv6HySLtvSeryCdxev2vp9nvyL6YHRYwD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCKjtdL9A6onpw-LL4xzFMlR1pIQ6Jf5s1UA2L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

Amazing work. I thought it would take a week to clear up my storage space, but it only took 1 day! They arrived promptly and worked efficiently all day. They even finished an hour earlier than expected. It was so painless that I don’t know why I didn’t do it sooner. I highly recommend them!!!< /Text>

<review>Words cannot express how grateful  I am to Cori and her team at Simplify Move LA! My family and  I are doing a major remodel on our home and had to move to a rental house for 10 months. The thought of moving twice and the stress of construction was really weighing heavily on me. Not only did Cori and her team take all that stress away, but also they literally changed our lives. Cori, Karen, Sharon, Jacqueline and Natalie were like mama bears. They created calm in a chaotic move. Never in my life have  I known every single item  I have in my house, but also where every item is and know that each item now has a place. They also went through our office which was filled to the ceiling with stuff. By the time we moved out of our home we had filled bags with donations and trash. I felt lighter and it was such a relief. We also were fully moved  into our rental home within 3 days of moving! Our friends and family couldn’t believe that everything was unpacked, organized, down to even having our pictures hung on the walls. Thank you again Cori, Karen, Sharon, Jacqueline and Natalie! We couldn’t have done this move without you! We can’t wait to see you guys again when we move back to our home! Many thanks, Lindsay, Adam, Emma and Brody!</review>< user_name>

Simplify and Move LA is awesome! I hired them during a stressful time and Cori and her team handled everything from A-Z. I didn’t have to worry about a thing. From measuring details at the new residence to determining which furniture to move, packing up old place and unpacking at new place, coordinating furniture to be donated for pickup, she made it an easy process. I highly recommend this company for a stress- free move! P.S. Karen is amazing and very organized.< /review>

< Review>
Cori and her team were the perfect choice for us. At
90 & 93 years old we moved my parents from their house to my house. Having to downsize which was
stressful enough for my mother, Cori made the experience for her and all of us easy and smooth.  From the packing to unpacking, then emptying the house she coordinated everything.  My parents were not only moved in but the pictures were hung and everything was put away before they left.  I can’t stress enough the wonderful, caring, attention to detail service we received.  Thank you Cori and Karen! It would have been a nightmare without you!<//Review>

Cori and her crew, Karen, Deborah and Stella were fabulous! They moved my elderly mother on short notice and recreated her old apartment in her new apartment, including placing about 100 little figurines in 2 curio cabinets exactly as they were. AMAZING!! A pleasure to work with. Got the job done on time and took what could have been very stressful and made it very easy. Definitely would recommend them and would use them again!</Text>

We had just moved from a large suburban house to a townhouse in Brentwood. While we did donate and sell a lot of furniture and stuff we didn’t need, we were still overwhelmed by boxes and more boxes that had been kept at a separate storage unit.
Cori’s team of highly professional ladies came to help us unpack and organize everything and saved us from drowning in our boxes. Cori even went to Costco to pick out the ideal shelves and containers for us and delivered them herself.
Although her service is definitely at the high end of the organizing and unpacking service, it was worth it. Our only regret is that we wish we had used her services before we started our move!< /Text>

Cori's not good, she's GREAT. Totally responsive, she jumped right into a situation and did an absolutely terrific, top-notch job. She cares about what she does and has genuine sympathy for clients and the emotions associated with moving. She has resources, goes the extra mile and takes pride in her work both in terms of executing the nuts and bolts of the job but also in terms of aesthetics and design sensibility. She's the full package for moving, organizing or whatever service you need her for. She went above and beyond, worked late and communicated extremely well with all parties in the style they needed, a quality that cannot be overestimated and makes the whole thing go as smoothly as possible<//text>

<Review>Cori and her team are the best! They are emotional and physical life savers!

Earlier in the year I had moved my mom into her small, but lovely, senior apartment.  There were boxes  and furniture piled and stacked from floor to ceiling which my mom had wanted to unpack and go through herself.  Fast forward to six months later...and zero progress. I realized this was a job too big for either of us, so I reached out to Cori to see what she could do.

To my (our) amazement, Cori and her team swooped in with a plan.  Not only were they super organized and efficient, they were friendly, communicated well and maintained the morale in what could have been a highly stressful process.

The end result was a cleared out apartment with just a meaningful handful of organized boxes of items my mom had decided she needed, much more manageable for my mom.

Cori and her team made my mom's new future look brighter.  There is no way we could have done what Simplify and Move LA accomplished in just one day!

Much thanks and appreciation to Cori snd her team!</Review>< Name>

Cori & the Simplify + Move team helped us organize & execute a complicated move from NoCal to SoCal — and made the difficult process of moving an aging parent into assisted living much easier and more graceful. Cori’s mover and handyman recommendations were fantastic; and her team set up the new apartment with care and consideration. We’re all thrilled with the resulting space and we didn’t have to unpack anything ourselves, which allowed us to spend quality time together during this transition. Highly recommend.</text>

I hired Simplify and Move when we moved my mother from her home into assisted living.  This time can be very stressful for the family, but having Cori and her team to handle the overwhelming task of  sorting through, packing, selling and moving a lifetime’s worth belongings was such a relief.  I live out of state and it would literally have been impossible for me to complete the task in any reasonable time frame and certainly not with her skill or efficiency.  I highly recommend Simplify and Move!!  Thank you, Cori.<//Review>

Cori and her team are the absolute best and are angels in disguise! After months of being stuck at home during the pandemic, the clutter around my house was driving me insane. Now matter how hard I tried I didn’t have the mental capacity to go through it all and organize it myself. I started following Cori’s  Instagram page and was immediately drawn to her warm nature and her ability to document the specific jobs she was doing. What I was most impressed with was her work with seniors and relocating them to senior homes. In fact, some of her stories brought me to tears! I finally pulled the trigger and it was the best decision I could have made for my family and our sanity! Cori and her team member Karen were phenomenal in helping me sift through the clutter and decide what was important to keep and what could be trashed or donated. The best part was that they handled the piles of trash and donations at the end of the day and I didn’t have to stress about where to bring all the discarded items.  Everything was beautifully organized and labeled and was honestly like a dream come true! If you are thinking about hiring Cori my advice is JUST DO IT!  It is money well spent!  Clearing the clutter will clear your mind and allow you to focus on more important things that you’ve been putting off. I guarantee you won’t regret it!</Review>

Cori and her team really saved us in a very stressful situation. My 92 year old mother needed to move from Skilled Nursing into Assisted Living.  There was a lot of confusion during the Pandemic with facilities being locked down.  Cori was very understanding and she and her team (call out to Karen) did a fantastic job of collaborating on a plan and moving my moms home from one location to another.  Everything was setup with care and a lot of thought.  Using Simplify and Move took a lot of the pressure and stress off of us.  We highly recommend !

<Review>Moving is never easy, but Cori took some of the sting out of it for us.  As seniors we were not up to doing it ourselves and having her arrange for the packing and moving made it possible.

Cori and her team do any amazing job! They are a great help to seniors and their families during a very challenging and stressful time. They are so kind and caring and take away all the worry in managing the move from their homes. They are extremely thorough and come here to measure the apartment that is reserved and then go to their home and know exactly what will fit and where it will go so that move in day goes very smoothly. They set everything up so that the resident can walk in to a beautiful space with no chaos. In a time of such uncertainty this is quite a comfort to all involved. Our residents that have used this service are extremely pleased. I highly recommend them to anyone moving to assisted living.

We recently moved into a new home and from the start I knew I wanted to have a professional come in and set me straight by editing and organizing my kitchen. Calling Cori with Simplify & Move LA was a no brainer. She came in to our home for a consult and  with in a few days, set the date for my big day!  I was truly amazed and blown away with all they accomplished in one day. The results totally exceeded my expectations. I love looking in my pantry and cabinets and seeing that everything has its place. My husband, although hesitant at first, is also happy and grateful with the results...

A million thanks to Cori and her team (my fairy Godmothers)<//Review>

This review is a long time coming and I apologize!! Cori helped me move my mom into a memory care facility and while at first I wasn’t sure I needed something like this it turned out it was an invaluable service and something I couldn’t have done without her.  She thinks of everything and takes the pressure and stress off of trying to think of everything so you can focus on your loved one and the transition they are about to make.  Because she moved her father not too long ago she can empathize and speaks with true experience and can hold your hand through it all.  I was truly amazed with how my moms room looked when I brought her to her new home and there were so many special touches added.  I thank Cori and her team and hope to have her organize me in my own home as well.< /text>

<review>I couldn’t recommend Cori and her team highly enough! The attention to detail and care that went into every inch of my home was astounding. They went above and beyond what I had expected and hoped for. My home move went smoothly thanks to them and is now totally organised and my kids now enjoy putting their toys back in their assigned place. Thank you Cori!< /review>< gmapID>

<Text>Cori and her team are life savers! We called them very last minute to help us get our garage cleaned out. It was packed with various things that  our family of four has collected over the years. We needed to get our house ready to list, and had some complicated logistics, as some stuff was going to long term storage, and some to short term storage. Karen and Jacqueline got through our garage in two days, and coached us through getting rid of so many things we don't need.

We loved them so much we asked them to come back the next week to help with the interior of the house. Now our home looks so organized and tidy, and the stuff that went into storage is well organized with a reference list and a system to delineate short and long term storage. We never could have done it without them in the length of time we had. Even in the COVID-19 era we felt safe with them in our home, and they made it easy to trust them to go through our things and help us pare down and make decisions. They were pleasant to work with and good at assessing our state of mind about all of our stuff. It really helps to have an unbiased party helping out when spouses have to decide to get rid of things.

We are so grateful for them.You won't regret investing in this service from Simplify and Move!<//Text>< gmap_id>

<rating>5</rating><Text>We found Cori through word of mouth and through following her on Instagram.  She was immediately responsive and guided us through a complicated move that required lots of organizing, bringing in appraisers, researching and organizing storage options, movers, trash pick ups, donations etc.  We were also organizing the move from a distance and were not able to meet her or attend the move in person.  We put complete faith in Cori and were not disappointed! Cori guided us through every step of the way and checked in frequently.   All in all it was a three day move with many moving parts that had to be coordinated.  Cori, Karen and their team are very professional, diligent and helpful.  We couldn’t have done it without them and will certainly work with Cori again!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I feel like a weight has been lifted off of my shoulders as this was always something on my to-do list, but the thought of even emptying the drawers was overwhelming. Cori is so knowledgeable and personable. She assessed the situation and brought every solution imaginable over until she found the perfect fit for each area. Her attention to detail is amazing and she truly left her mark on our home with both form and function. I would recommend her over and over again and hope to have her back to go through the other rooms in our house!</Text>< pictures>

<Text>I recently needed to relocate my elderly father, suddenly and unexpectedly. Cori and Karen came to my rescue! Challenges that seemed overwhelming to me were easily solved by Cori through her knowledge, skill, expertise and creative solutions, and the relocation process was launched and completed in a professional, organized, and expeditious manner! Cori’s sense of customer service and never-ending offers to help went above and beyond and never ceased to amaze me!  Cori clearly genuinely cares about those she works with. She says it is an honor to help the elderly and their families. After working with Cori and getting to know her a little bit, I assure you, the honor was all mine! I would highly recommend Cori! …And to Cori and Karen, I say, “Thank you from the bottom of my heart!”</Text></record></dataset><record>

“Hiring Cori to organize your house is like hiring a friend who has known you for years and who won’t let you be your own worst enemy.  She is inspirational, motivating, and trustworthy. In my dreams, Cori lives with me for a month, transforms my whole house, scrapbooks my life, and shows me how to cook so I can relax and read a book every once in a while. I would recommend her to anybody and everybody. No matter what type of clutter is around you, Cori will turn a headache into a fun and rejuvenating experience.

In two days with Cori, I did more organizing and purging than I had done myself in two years!  I wasn’t even tired when she left-- I wanted to keep going!   My house finally looks like all the pages of the magazines I’ve been ripping out for years – which Cori had me throw away, of course!

I can’t recommend her services enough.
She is so matter-of-fact about the whole process that it took much less time than I thought it would. Cori, I feel accomplished. I can’t thank you enough.<//Review>

<Text>Cori is nothing short of amazing, a true ray of sunshine into the dim corners of my closet.  After 17 years of accumulating clothing, shoes and accessories in my closet, I could no longer locate a good percentage of the things I wanted to wear, let alone find place for anything new.  In conversation before embarking on this daunted project, Cori offered confident reassurance that I could trust.

Help arrived punctually and well-equipped, entering my home with a smile on her face, a box of large garbage bags and no judgement.  Over the course of a weekend afternoon, Cori helped identify pieces to keep, items no longer of interest and patiently guided me as I weighed the merits of continuing my pack-rat ways with making room for the wardrobe I truly wanted to keep. Her calm demeanor, rational suggestions, incomparable cheer and deference kept the task moving while instilling a sense of fun, as we laughed together over unfortunate style choices lurking on forgotten hangers. Sorting through 5 shelves, 4 racks and 60 shoe boxes, Cori reorganized and denoted areas for each, then tackled my dresser to remove garments no longer worn and create space for everyday necessities, previously stuffed into random bags on my closet floor.

She then graciously schlepped six large hefty bags full of discards to a favorite charity and returned with a tax receipt and organizing tools to perfect the purge, including no-slip hangers, clear shoe boxes and sweater bags to protect my investments.

Getting dressed is now something to enjoy, with a feeling of contentment Cori created.  I know where everything is!  I recommend her highly to friends… and especially my own clients as a valuable resource in any area of your home or office.  Cori rocks.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Cori and her team are so friendly and energetic and wow do they get it done quick!  We communicated for a few months before I finally made the commitment to have our garage organized for a move coming up.  I just wish we had done it sooner. ! My husband was not initially on board (we can do it ourselves mentality), he agreed because we just kinda ran out of time.   After his entire work area of the garage was organized and labeled he was so thankful and beyond impressed and happy.  Even if we had more time we could never have achieved what Cori and Karen did.  Thank You Cori, our move will be so much easier now.  I look forward to scheduling my office/guestroom and hopefully the kitchen too.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>“Cori went from room to room and helped me purge years of items I had collected.  We labelled everything from clothing shelves to storage closet.  Everything has its place now. She took my donations, returns, trash and shredding and took them out of my house and brought them to their respective places.  She gave me ideas and implemented better organizing for my business and personal files.  She helped me with organizing recipes, business items and bedrooms.  Also, I had been paying for a 10x10’ storage unit for 15 years.  And over a weekend, we cleared out the whole thing, down to really the only items I wanted to keep and I was able to get rid of the unit- and the monthly cost!  She even took my frequent flier cards and put them into my phone, so I wouldn’t have to carry so much junk around.

But the favorite thing she did for me is take 10 boxes of memorabilia for YEARS of my two teen daughters growing up, and condense it down to a manageable sized binder for each!   My daughters love their memory books, and I loved getting rid of those 10 boxes… and FINALLY having a great way to keep their keepsakes!

There are no words to convey our "THANK YOU" for all the care and moving our loving brother into his new digs.

After living in his home for over 40 years with all of his memories & tresures was abit of a test.  But Cori was so understanding when she listened to his concerns and calmed them.

The packing, moving all & the placement of all his treasures was more than perfect, it greeted him with warmth & WELCOME HOME!!!

Thank you Cori.  Your understanding  & care was such a blessing. You should go national!!!!!!!

Kind Regards & You are the BEST

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>edit: because I live across the world, it took my stuff a while to arrive. when it did arrive, I found boxes that were not only numbered but name labeled so I didnt have to keep going back to the list to figure out whats in every box. when the team was packing my place, there were several categories of things that they asked if I wanted them packed or not, I said that anything that looked like it would travel well for 3 months, be unloaded put in at least 2 trucks before I get it back- please pack, trusting the team to make the calls on specific items. wow was I right! the care they had put into careful packing of everything, including the breakables, is WOW. the boxes being labeled also meant faster unpacking and I was basically able to throw out the boxes themselves in less then 2 days (this includes local organizations and work). Im so happy I decided to go with Cori and her team, 3 months later +- that I had to come back here and update my review of them. Cori- if you get a notification about this update, thank you, happy 2021!

Cori spoke with me several times before my move date, was very reasuring, honest, trustworthy, friendly, nice... when I asked to make the move earlier, she found a way to do it. Karen and Jackie were amazing and facetimed me through packing, and handling the moving company. excellent.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I was referred to Simplify and Move by the senior living facility I wanted to move my mom into. Cori responded right away and we met at my mom's condo several days later so I could tell her which pieces of furniture, small items, and pictures were going to be moved. I loved and truly appreciated her experienced advice. On packing day, she and her associate, Karen, were prompt, extremely respectful and capable, and packed my mom's things in a very careful manner. On the actual moving day, she met the movers at the condo and facilitated them packing and putting everything into their moving truck. Her associate, Karen, met her at the facility and after the movers had placed the furniture, Cori and Karen went to work unpacking everything else and placing it. I gave her carte blanche, as it was clear she's not just a "schlepper" - she's got an eye for design and placement. After it was done, we FaceTimed and she showed me the whole place! It was beautiful! I couldn't be more pleased. She quoted me a fair price and stuck to it - no surprises. She sent me the final invoice and accepted all payments through Zelle - so easy for me! I definitely plan to use her again when I have to clear out my mom's place in order to rent it. She told me she can not only pack and move things, but she will recommend estate appraisers and get whatever I don't want either donated or hauled away. This lady is a gem!</review>

Cori of Simplify and Move LA, is great!  She is detailed, organized, patient, caring and accomodating. She makes a great use of space, communicates well, has great follow through, and takes pride in her work, (thing that you do not find much these days).

Last week Cori completed a move for my senior uncle who was moving from his 1500 sqft home  to a 500 sq.ft. apartment in a senior retirement communiy.  My uncle had accumulated a tremoundous amount of “stuff.”  Because I live out of the area and due to covid restrictions we needed someone who could handle all the logisitics of this move. Cori was great.  She came to his house FaceTimed me and we all viewed his items and discussed what he should and could take, because my uncle had lived in his home for over 50 years and was very attached to and wanted to take nearly everything. Cori patiently listened and made suggestions. When packing day came and my uncle added more items then those that were originally agreed upon, she was patient in trying to accomodate his requests.

Throughout the moving process Cori communicated with my uncle, his close friend and I.  She was very good about contacting me to check in and keep the move on track and was very responsive when I called and left a message, usually responding within minutes, but at the latest by the end of the day.  She is detailed and organized.  Her caring and upbeat and personality are reasuring and are so needed in these stressful moves for seniors.

When Cori revealed the new space we were all so impressed, especially my uncle.  He commented on how she had made his display items look like jewels as if they belonged in a muesum. The space was organized and looked great!

If you have a move I recommend Cori and Simplify and Move LA.</text>

Cori was a HUGE help before, during and after our move.  She was extremely efficient, pro-active and experienced. She knew exactly how to pack up our most fragile items, and did it in record time. Working full time and raising two kids, it would have been almost impossible to pack our belongings in time without her help.

And, after we moved, she came to the new house to help us unpack and get organized. After the stress and exhaustion of the move, it was so wonderful to come home from work to see my kitchen organized (better than I would have done it!), and my kids' rooms and office unpacked and organized as well.  It really made the move SO much less painful, and got us to the point where we could enjoy our new house that much quicker. I recommend Cori without reservation!<//Review>

I highly recommend Cori to anyone who needs help decluttering and/or organizing their space. I first called Cori because I was completely overwhelmed with junk. Between my two kids and a full time job, our two bedroom condo and office became a disaster zone.  I had no time to sort through things, and I was terrified of approaching anyone to help me with such a daunting, monumental task.

Cori arrived like a breath of fresh air...well, more like an organizing tornado.  She helped me sort through every inch of my house, and then took everything with her to donate when she left my home, so I was left with an organized, zen space.   She has a natural ability to identify the best way to organize a home, is incredibly patient, and has amazing energy (which was critical every time I wanted to quit). She is warm, funny and fun to be around, which made the whole process infinitely more bearable. I cannot recommend Cori enough!!  You’ll wonder why you waited so long to GET ORGANIZED!<//Review>

Working with Cori Allvey has been an excellent experience.  After years of having a busy work schedule – my house definitely needed a clean-out and Cori was the perfect person to help me.  She was organized, solution oriented, extremely time efficient and left no detail un-attended.  She patiently, yet firmly went through every nook and cranny in my house and the end result has been wonderful. I have been holding onto so many items for years that I never touch.  Cori encouraged me to finally let go of all of the extra stuff and in the process, she also helped me donate much of it to worthy causes.

If you are ready to commit to really letting go of your extra things – Cori is the best person to help you with home or office.  She has worked tirelessly and efficiently to help me reach my goals and I am thrilled with the results!”< /review>

I stumbled upon Cori's services just by chance and I'm so grateful that I did.   I'm a single businessman and I needed some help de-cluttering my house.   I had years and years of files and paperwork that I had been holding onto, as well as clothes decades old!  Cori patiently but firmly helped me sort through everything I no longer needed and donated them to the appropriate places, bringing me back tax receipts.   I had her handle many projects around my house that needed attention, like new screens on all the windows, interviewing and getting quotes from house painters and roofers.  But then my de-clutter and house upkeep projects turned into a complete house remodel and Cori set up interviews with contractors and interior designers and got the entire project off the ground for me.  She's fun to work with, reliable, prompt, and has energy to spare.  And I never felt judged for the random possessions she kept coming across in my home!  Whenever I wanted to quit, she kept me going.   I highly recommend her for any guy who needs help with small or large projects.</text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Two years since moving into our home, the converted garage that was intended to be my husband's music studio had instead become a storage unit. I knew if I didn't do something right away, it would be a lost cause, but I also knew organizing was not my strong suit. Cori came in and in two days, we accomplished what would have taken me three months or more  do on my own. Paying someone to help you decide whether or not you really need to keep "stuff" around is a hugely effective way of decluttering. And Cori's no-nonsense attitude about reducing is highly contagious.

As part of her service, Cori takes unwanted items to donation centers right away, finds people to get other jobs, such as reupholstering, and drops off old technology at electronic recycling centers. Further more,  if you have something you want to sell, Cori makes you put it on craigslist right away. (I sold my husband's old speakers and quickly made back her rate and then some.) After the success of the studio, I also used Cori to help organize my preschooler's room, my office and other "everything" drawers around the house.

In the months since we worked together, I've found that I always think twice about what I bring into my home in the first place!!  I know organizing seems like something you should be able to do on your own, but let's face it, it's much easier said than done. I really can't recommend Cori and her professional services highly enough.</text>< time>

<Review>Amazing restaurant. The food there is amazing and out of this world. The only thing that is holding this place back is the service is sooo slow . It took over an hour to get our food. But if you guys wait patiently the food is more than worth it.< /Review>< Pics>

We were staying at the Tropicana suites a few doors down. I had read a few reviews for the Pizza Press & they were good so we gave it a try. We were not disappointed. We ended up eating here a few times during our Disney visit. Great food, great value.< /text>

Visited there this evening for the first time with a group of eight. They were ready for us and service was prompt. We were meeting friends to catch-up, so there was a lot of talking. They didn't rush us or push. Wonderful menu and they said if we didn't see something we wanted to let them know. I asked for...</review>

Dancing can be fun if you're into old school Latin sounds. Bands are sometimes fun. so food. Place looks run down.< /text>

<Date>1567481968532<//Date><rate>4<//rate><Text>For food, I wouldn't necessarily go there. I go for the dancing. It's a place where you see an older generation dance Latin music. They play a lot of older music (salsa, merengue, cumbia, bachata, etc.), so if you're into the latest and don't dig the older stuff, this place may not be for you. I've gone tho this placefor many years, and it hasn't changed. You see many of the same folks every time. I feel a bit safer here than a regular club, though. It's a $10 cover. Try to get there early enough (10ish), and you shouldn't have an issue with parking.< /Text>< pictures>

I went with a group of friends,we were excited, but turned out we had the worst experience ever.  We were charged $20 cover, plus $10 to get in.  We were told that if we wanted to stay we should buy food.. The lady @ the front desk said that we will be given the cover back if we buy food. We trusted her, but when we were leaving we asked for the $20 cover. She refused and the security guard asked us to leave.  We didn't want to cause trouble, but this place is horrible.  I would believe only low lives go to this place.
Our dinner including tax was about $70 per person. Food was terrible, cold and a bottle of water was about $6.
Plus they have only one server..  You can find better places.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME.< /text>

I wonder if the cooks are ticas or ticos?  I say that because in Van Nuys there was a Costa Rican restaurant but the owner could not find Costa Ricans to go work for her and cook. She hired some non Costa Ricans and tried teaching them how to cook our food but it was not the same.

I also thought that the food was over priced. I think that the owner is relying on the fact the he/she has the only Costa Rican restaurant in town. If there were other Costa Rican restaurants they would have to up their game or close. Lastima!

I tremendously do no recommend get not even near this..... (so call "CLUB").
Not only the service is mediocre. In magnifying proportions the unwelcoming guest hostess will ask you to pay extra  $5.00 dsl if I want to finish my drink (that is after I  pay my drink )< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Mediocre food and overpriced menu. I had the azon con pollo and the chicken tasted off. Only liked the costa rican tamales but that was overpriced!<//Text>

My family went to visit one of the few Costa Rican restaurants in this country and they were treated poorly. They received horrible service, since the waitresses were watching tv and moved them from one table to another (mind you my mom is handicap). As well as once my parents were leaving, the waitresses tried to hurry them out of the handicap parking my mom was in. I do not recommend this trash customer serving restaurant. I am a proud Costa Rican and this is just not how our culture treats others. We are a happy energetic full of life culture and I'm disgusted at this location.< /text>

<review>waited 25 minutes to be seated after reservation and there were plenty of open tables.
waiter was fair at best, didn't describe dishes, only statements of good.
over priced, recommend other Disney experiences
not fine dining, very average overall

<review>This place is a dump,, they have folding metal chairs and tables, not even a tablecloth. Very cheesy and old inside.The hostess and waitress very rude. The food was mediocre, they charge 10.00 pp even if ur having dinner. The only thing good was the music, even thou dancefloor small and very crowed. Will not visit again.< /review>< user_name>

(Translated by Google) The food definitely has no Costa Rican flavor, it's a shame that it's the only restaurant with supposed Costa Rican food and it's tasteless and cooked just by filling a menu.
It is a pity that the food does not have the real taste of Costa Rica, in fact the food is not very good to be taken into account. Many Central Americans come to dance and the atmosphere gets pretty.

Es una pena que la comida no tenga el real sabor de Costa Rica, de hecho la comida no es muy buena para que lo tomen en cuenta. Llegan muchos Centroamericanos a bailar y el ambiente se pone bonito.</text>

(Translated by Google) A very beautifully decorated restaurant, unfortunately the food tonight was a separate disaster that lasted half an hour in each dish, the simple meat pot without any flavor, I asked the waitress to take it away and I asked for a chifrijo that only Beans was that I brought a couple of chicharrones on top as decoration, I asked for it to be taken away and better I asked for the bill to go eat somewhere else.
I don't recommend it feels ugly since I traveled almost 50 miles to eat there.

(Original)
Un restaurante muy lindo decorado, lamentablemente la comida esta noche fue un desastre aparte que se duraron media hora en cada plato, la olla de carne simple sin ningun tipo de sabor, le pedí a la mesera que se la llevara y pedí un chifrijo que solo frijoles era que traia un par de chicharrones arriba como decoración, igual pedí que se lo llevaran y mejor pedí la cuenta para ir a comer a otro lugar.
No lo recomiendo se siente feo ya que viaje casi 50 millas para ir a comer ahí.👎</Text>

(Translated by Google) I don't know why they charge the entrance to dinner! I think we would have the right to enjoy music, especially after paying so expensive for food and drinks. Besides, the food is not 100% Costa Rican.

(Original)
no se porque cobran la entrada para ir a cenar! pienso.que tendriamos derecho de disfrutar de la musica, especialmente despues de pagar tan caro por comida y bebidas., ademas la comida no es 100% Costarricense.< /review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>(Translated by Google) Only to dance the track is small but they have a live group, I would never recommend it to eat very poorly served and typical traditional nothing to see. And it is true the staff that attends including the owner in addition to bad character rude and EYE often charge more.

(Original)
Solamente para bailar es pequeña la pista pero tienen grupo en vivo, jamás lo recomendaría para comer carísimo mal servido y de típicos tradicional nada que ver. Y es verdad el personal que atiende incluyendo la dueña además de mal carácter rudas y OJO muchas veces cobran de más .</Review>< Name>

This company is extremely UNETHICAL.I lived  at their Residences at Lakeside Property in Lombard, IL for a year I always paid my rent on time and every petty fee they made up. I left a spotless apartment and  I never seen my deposit. Check their reviews as well. They lied and said they mailed it to the address I moved from on sire and them started to ignore all calls and emails.Every time I call JRK Property Holdings the secretary forwards my call to a voicemail system for Sophia who never return calls or emails.They are SCAMMERS.These people should really be ashamed of themselves. Its disgusting.To scam renters during a GLOBAL PANDEMIC is SICK.<//review>

<review>I enjoy working at JRK Property Holdings. They recognize other peoples culture which means a lot to me. They have special events just for that. The raises were pretty decent and everybody has a good relationship with other employees. The office that I work at has a great concept of work/life balance. You rarely work more than 40 hours and are compensated very fairly.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrXnzBDg4dyxtVKPyWR_9vixWUK-zs21O55T_9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>{'time': 1524114120393, 'text': 'Thank you for leaving us a review!

The office of JRK Property Holdings never answer the phone! Left several messages since 2/28/2021 still no response!! My guess keeping my money in their business account to accumulate interest off of my money that I need to survive on!

JRK Property Holdings has been a great place to work. It is a new and fast paced office that is rapidly growing. It has a fun environment with good benefits. The management team is really focused on making you successful in your career. I have been able to learn so much from my peers.<//text>

The apartment staff have little to no power and JRK isn't interested in helping customers with issues. We had an apartment that didn't have heat for 9 days (when overnight lows were in the 20s). Had to bug management constantly to get it fixed with multiple return trips. JRK not willing to compensate or help us out in any way. They offered us a cheap directional space heater for a 1550 sq ft apartment. Hung up on my wife when she called to complain. You can tell all the positive reviews here are astroturfed.<//Review><gmapID>0x80c2bb676ae8a897:0xfc5d93b5ea1901a5< /gmapID></record>

<Review>I have been trying to reach someone at this agency for 5 days straight. I have left 5 voice mails and no one will call me back, most of the time I cannot even speak to an operator, my call is sent straight to voicemail. I am extremely disappointed that no one will contact me to address the issue of being over charged, but they will gladly make the charge without any information or notice. Upon further research, I discovered they are NOT accredited by the BBB and I clearly see why.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>I have lived at the residents at lakeside in Lombard for 3 years and I cannot say one thing positive. They have asked me multiple times to show documentation about the same renters insurance policy that I have kept since living here. This shows that they regularly make clerical errors but instead of checking the records they threat to charge me fees even though I remain in compliance.

They made promises to upgrade appliances but never have. Instead the washer/dryer in my unit continue to age and I have to pay more in electricity as I have to run them multiple times to wash my clothes.

They also have safety issues every year. Snow and Ice removal is not done for days if not weeks after a snowfall and this can be very dangerous. Frankly it's surprises me that they remain in business as I am sure if a child slipped or fell they would be sued.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Due to unforeseen circumstances I had to move out from Boulders at Puget Sound Apartments during the middle of my lease. The staff has been extremely helpful and kind, which has alleviated much stress during a trying time.

Overall, living at The Boulders at Puget Sound has been a great experience. The staff and residents have always been incredibly friendly and the building is gorgeous and in a great location!< /text>

I have been calling the corporate office since January 14th 2020 and have not received a response. A lady named Jessica answers and directs my call everytime and my lease is almost over and I have yet to receive a return call. I live at hideaway lakes in Charlotte and I have yet to receive a phone call back but they can remodel the property for millions and handle the tremendous roach problem they have.</review>

Lived here for over 5 years and I can honestly say that my overall experience living here was good. Yeah there are some issues that come up from time to time in an apartment complex, but when I had a problem maintenance took care of it promptly and with grace. Thanks for some great memories at Chase Arbor, take care!<//Review>

I never leave reviews, but I felt I needed to about JRK property holdings. This company took over my apartment complex at the end of March right after the covid-19 shut down in Michigan. Nothing but problems since then. They cut the onsite staff immediately making it difficult for staff to do their job. They sent letters out regarding a 12 thousand dollar renovation project they intended to start in a few month even though we were in the begining of a pandemic. They wanted to increase my rent by 7% making my 495 sq foot apartment with outdated appliances almost $900 a month not including most of the utilities. When attempting to get ahold of someone to discuss this increase I could reach no one. No one at my own complex office (due to the staff being cut) and no one at the main office in LA. I decided I would find another apartment rather than deal with such an unprofessional company. It hasn't even been 30 days since I turned my keys in and today I come home to a letter from a collector regarding my past due amount with the apartment I recently vacated. As I have been waiting for my last utility bill from them and the notice of what is happening to my deposit, I was surprised to receive something from a collector. This company only cares about making money and will cut as many corners as they can to get it. If you have the chance to distance yourself from this company I would.</review>

The mission is simple and clear at JRK Property Holdings, everyone is essentially working towards changing the world and bettering people’s lives, one job at a time.

No complaints, good place to start and grow a career. The management is helpful, the work is interesting and growth is tremendous.

They really know how to keep a great work life balance and treat their employees really well! The training program they offer to new hires is amazing and well put together.<//text>

SECURE DEPOSIT WILL NEVER BE RETURNED, DO NOT BE LITTLE.

I've lived in the Addison Place/ FL, for 3 years, but for the last 2 years, this new administration has been a nightmare.
Since I changed apartments, in the same condominium, 1 month ago, my nightmare started.
They invented a lot of repairs that needed to be done in the previous apartment, and took my deposit.
If I were to put all the problems I had in the previous apartment and what I am having now, I would give a book.
Advice: if you don't want to get stressed, DO NOT COME TO LIVE AT ADDISON PLACE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

JRK is a joke. They do not answer their phones, and when they do they send you to voicemail or blatantly hang up on you in the MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE. Whoever works their phones needs training and manners. Not to mention that their properties are disgusting because of the lack of maintenance. Do not live anywhere that JRK is involved. Release your tenants deposit checks in a timely manner JRK!!!!<//text>

<rating>1<//rating><text>I have been dealing JRK Property Holdings since May 14, 2020, with no resolution. They are the corporate for Hideaway Lake Luxury Apt, now, Citra Luxury Apartments in NC. My husband and I are still waiting on a refund in the amount of $300 for a deposit that was made at the time of applying. The originally refund was mailed to the wrong address, although the company was informed several times that we were moving and provided with the correct address. When we call the apartment complex they give us a corporate #, when we call the corporate # a RUDE "operator" answers and tries to transfer you to a voicemail, almost immediately. Apparently she's the only one who works the phone (or so we were told when she put me on hold and advised that I was holding her up by asking my questions). She advised all she's able to do is transfer and/or provide us with an email. She did not provide her name when asked for my records, I was informed to put operate and the call disconnected. *I assume I was hung up on.
We have left several voicemails (again, with no return call) for corporate and the apartment complex. We have contacted the BBB.
After this experience, I would deter anyone from doing business with this company for they are dishonest (no refund received) and difficult to communicate with. I do not think it should take 2 months to correct an error, even during this time.
As someone who has spent 10+ years in a management position in the customer service field, I truly hope they are able to get their office(s) together and improve upon their communication.</text></record>

Would give 0 stars if I could. HORRIBLE customer service. I’m currently having issues with my apartment management raising my rent to DOUBLE! I have left two emails to this company and a voicemail with no responses. I just today called several times and they keep rejecting my calls. This is absurd. Now, I am being charged $1,410 for a one bedroom plain-Jane apartment that I was previously paying $775 for. Not only this, but being out of work amidst this public health crisis has put my husband and I in quite a financial bind. ALSO, we aren’t even living in the apartment currently, but they are making us pay for an extra 60 days after we communicated with the management prior about us moving out.  Wish I could leave a positive review, as my first months at this apartment were pleasant. However, this company is clearly proving that they could care less about their customers. I am at a loss.</text>

This company is predatory! They will steal from you! I have been trying to get my $400 "refundable" deposit that was required JUST TO APPLY for a month now. I have called and left multiple messages with no luck. They are great at communicating until they have your money, then they ghost you.< /text>

I have been trying to get a refund check for a deposit i am owed from my prior apartment complex. JRK has terrible customer service and responsiveness. They have continually sent me to voicemail and I have never gotten through to speak to a real person other than the secretary. I have not received proper communication from their office or any follow up on the status of my check. It has been well over the 30 days they claim needed to review and process a refund check. The fact i have not been able to speak to a company representative or know the status of the money i am owed is a testament to their business practices, they do not care about their customers.</text>

PLEASE BE AWARE... This company does not respond to issues with their properties. I applied at Arwen Vista 11505 Masterton Road
Charlotte, NC 28262. I put a $475.00 deposit on an apt that I was told I would be approved for on April 16, 2020. I was later told that the apt wasn't vacant and that I would receive my deposit back within 2-3 weeks. It never came. I've emailed and called the property  over 15 times with no luck. I've contacted the corporate office a 10 times and no luck. I know that $475.00 might be a kick in the bucket for such a large cooperation,. However, for me.. It's a lot of cheese. With this pandemic taking place and the price of everything skyrocketing I really need my money. To this day July 14, 2020 I still have not received my money nor has anyone answered the phone at the apt complex nor the JRK Property Holdings. I contacted the media in my city for help. Good luck with this company. I dodged a bullet with this complex..< /text>

Calling out your fake reviews. Especially the one at the boulders saying they worked out. You were just sued because of covid19 orders why would you lie about our amenities being open? The front door to the office isn't even open. Or is this what your employees are so busy doing? If you're reading to research I encourage you to check the people leaving 5 star reviews because they probably left a few on JRK and other JRK buildings and their pictures are obviously staged apartments</Text>

They still have yet to return our deposit more than a month after we left at 1425 Bedford St, Stamford CT .
The customer care is terrible and they refuse to get back to us regarding when we will get our money back. If this isn't theft i don't know what it is.<//review>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>The absolute worst management company I have EVER rented under. They will do absolutely everything in their power to screw you over at every turn. I did NOT sign my lease with them, but they bought the complex that I was living at half way through my lease. As soon as they took over everything started downhill. If I could have left immediately, I would have. They never respond, especially when you have things that actually need to be done in a timely fashion. The only time I received any response from them is when I threatened legal action. They do not take care of the property. Water was constantly being shut off with no explanation leaving residents unable to drink, shower, flush, etc.. The elevators never work. The "24/7" concierge is nonexistent.<//Text>< pics>

Brilliant staff from start to finish. Within walking distance over the pedestrian bridge to downtown Nashville. View of Titans stadium just across the road. When we tried to buy some water on arrival we were given it complimentary. Many thanks. Shuttle bus is great every half hour & we didn’t need to book. If your going into town & it’s late or your too tired to walk just ask & Bussey or any of the staff will help you out. Loved that girl. Rooms were fine. Breakfast really good & always well stocked. When we arrived our room had towels for 3 but we were 4, quick call & within 5 minutes more towels arrived. Loved Nashville & this Hotel made sure we were well looked after. Guitar shaped pool is clean & well stocked with towels perfect way to cool down. Highly Recommend.</review>

It is a fast, fun and employee friendly atmosphere and the company is a great place to start your career, it offers opportunities and exposure to learn and grow in all areas of the organization.

The company has very talented people who are committed to future growth and improving departmental processes and procedures to help the employees achieve their personal business and professional goals and overall growth.

My belief is if you can make it here you will make it anywhere because the vast experience that you will acquire will be a very valuable one that will remain with you always, and you will be thankfull for that.

To summarize, I have had an overall pleasant, fun and great learning experience working at JRK.< /text>< Name>

< review>
Residences at Lakeside is a great community, managed by some really sweet ladies. I viewed the apartments on at least 4 different occasions when trying to decide where to move. Every time the manager was so nice and helpful, even answering questions I’m sure she had already answered before.< /review>

<name>Sammy Powers< /name><date>1499543056934</date><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Due to some recent unforeseen circumstances to was forced to move from California back to my hometown of Charleston. While I initially found out that my only option was to move back to South Carolina I was very upset, but after spending a couple of months of acclimating and living at Hibben Ferry I am so happy to be back in Charleston! Growing up I had lived further away from Downtown than where Hibben Ferry is located, and that has made all of the difference.

Downtown Charleston is an amazing mixture of history and culture that living only a couple of minutes away is a huge perk of this complex. However, aside from Hibben Ferry’s location, the actual complex is amazing! There is absolutely no way that I would have been able to afford such a large and nice apartment back on the west coast.< /Text>< pictures>

crooks, Citigate in jacksonville has tons of issues and I have no idea how they havent been fired yet. They are all rude and will block your number if you call back twice. Have no knowledge about how to run a multifamily unit and I will suggest not to use jrk. They don't even answer at corporate.< /review>

<Review>Hi our tennis courts are closed saying COVID19  guidance from JRK corporate . When will you open the courts and let residents to play tennis this winter ? We are forced to go to public courts and  expose our self at higher risk . And really we can play tennis only by social distancing . Inspite of having the beautiful courts behind the door  we are given a reason "no you cant use" .  We pay rent promptly and we need help here< /Review>< Pics>

I stayed in one of there apartment in Richmond. Be aware of this people, they have a bunch of thief in Richmond. I stayed in Copper Mill apartment Richmond for just 9 months and following is my experience -
(1) They will upload the monthly rent bill on 30th night, sometimes it do not even reflect the website. If by any chance you forget to pay on 1st then on 2nd you will fined with a min $150. The management wants you to repeat this mistake multiple times so they will not suggest you to go for auto pay. I had to find out myself to do an auto pay so that I do not suffer the next time.
(2) During my move out inspite of keeping the apartment cleaned they charged me $600 + for carpet replacement and apartment cleaning. I am attaching some pictures which was taken on my move out date. Refer the picture and see how neat and clean I have left the apartment but then also they have charged me that amount.
(3) I requested the manager multiple times in mail, even the worst condition of the apartment was mentioned by me during my move in but the management do not even care about all such things, they will charge you like anything.
(4) The main management of this property is JRK, I notified them in written about the problem that I have faced but no response, they are just simply ignorant.

I request all to boycott this apartment if you want a good and comfortable place to stay and save your money.< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>The hotel staff was friendly and very helpful! We came to Nashville without a car and walked to Bicentennial Park, Broadway, Lunch at Puckett's. I does however sit at the top of a hill so be prepared for the walk back! The views are beautiful, we stayed with a view of the capital building and were inspired! There are elevators with glass walls and views all the way down into the lobby from every floor, but if that's not your thing there is an elevator available that is not so thrilling.

The lobby is beautiful but we were surprised that all of the seating available was at such a very low level. When we sat our knees were higher than our waists, and I know my parents would never be able to rise out of any sofa or chair in the lobby. In our room, our chair by the window was also at a super low level, but the desk chair was perfect! Only an issue if you have these sorts of mechanical limitations but they may be able to provide you with a more accessible chair if needed.

The rooms were very clean and comfortable and we never heard any noise on the 11th floor.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJYCtnWZWx4bDNs7bQN2nXobBn0yHrFgcQtOeR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>{'time': 1529901800452, 'text': 'Thanks for leaving us a review!'}</resp>< Gmap_id>

This is going to be a long review, so tl;dr is this: During my lease term, JRK changed the locks on my apartment and threw away my belongings.  They assumed I had vacated the apartment (a month before the end of my lease term, and the day after I paid another month's rent) without making any efforts to contact me to see if it was true. They were entirely unprofessional and unresponsive, and I finally had to retain a lawyer to help me get any kind of compensation for the queen-size bed, nightstand, desk, etc., and to get some rent back and my deposit.. As the leasing office manager told me on May 9, 2020 when I went to the office to find out why I couldn't get into my apartment, "This kind of thing happens all the time."

This happened at the Independence Green Apartments in Farmington Hills, Michigan.  A few months before the end of my lease, I moved in with my fiance to get away from Oakland County, which was quickly becoming a covid hot spot.  I returned to the apartment about once a week to get some of my things and check my mail. I continued to pay rent on time for the remaining two months of the lease.  Saturday, May 9 I arrived at my apartment to find that the locks had been changed. I called the leasing office to find out why I couldn't access my apartment. They told me my roommate and I had surrendered the unit (which we had not — our rent had been paid, and we were both well aware of following all lease provisions regarding moving out) and my furniture had been thrown away.  The leasing office confirmed that I was current on rent and "in possession of the apartment," but would not let me into my apartment or reimburse my rent, damage deposit, or the value of any of my possessions (including the Wifi router, for which I had to pay the internet company).  The people in the leasing office were non-responsive for weeks. I finally had to get a lawyer to get them to respond.   Even then, JRK was rude, dismissive, and completely unapologetic, despite the fact that they blatantly broke not only the terms of the lease, but they broke the law (an executive order was in place regarding evictions during the Covid state of emergency).  Before retaining a lawyer, I left numerous voicemails at the JRK corporate resident relations line, since they stopped answering my phone calls. When I called with a local area code, they answered once and then stopped answering my calls again.

The manager of the leasing office told me they had emptied the apartment and changed the locks on May 1, the day after I had paid my May rent, which I did in person.  He also said they had taken pictures of what was in the apartment before it was thrown away.  I asked repeatedly to see the pictures, with no result.  Finally my lawyer had to ask, and they finally sent them, but not everything that was in the apartment was pictured.  I still don’t know - even after nearly three months -  what happened to my possessions, or to the wifi router and modem which were not included in the photographs. JRK personnel said they threw them away in the dumpster by the tennis courts.

I cannot emphasize enough what a terrible experience it was to have to work with JRK.  They purchased the complex partway through my lease term, from another company (Hayman) who had been fantastic to work with from the very beginning.  I was happy at Independence Green until JRK took over, and dealing with their illegal self-help eviction was a nightmare.  WIthout a lawyer, I don't think I would have gotten anything back at all.

My impression of JRK is that they are, at best, disorganized, unprofessional, and careless about following their own lease agreements, and, at worst, willfully dishonest. My experience at Independence Green, once pleasant and trouble-free, turned sour when JRK took over ownership. JRK offered far less than full compensation for the losses I incurred, and after the aggravation of having to deal with them, I would strongly discourage others from leasing from them.<//text>

<text>Beware before applying to any JRK properties.
Note the 5 star reviews are generated by JRK staff.

JRK property Shadow Ridge and the people who work there should be called Shady Ridge, I’ve never experienced poorer customer service.
I first saw Shadow Ridge in the middle of March and liked it. The apartments were nice and our first experience was good. This ended once we paid the deposit and was approved in short order online.  We were told that the final documentation would be sent to us by the end of the week.  That date came and nothing. We waited a few days before we followed up.   After more days, we called Shadow Ridge’s phone number-the one on their website.  We were immediately sent to voicemail.  We left a message and provided a call-back number. Of course, we never received a response. By the end of the day without any return call, we tried again.  This time we got a person on the phone. I explained the issue and he was apologetic.  He said he needed to put us on hold while he looked into the problem.  We were on hold for 10-15 minutes and then unceremoniously disconnected.  Of course we called back and the call was sent directly to voicemail.  This pattern continued for over two weeks.
After chasing our tail, we sent a terse email to the customer service mailbox.  The email stated that we had been trying to finalize our lease for several weeks without success and we wanted a call to correct this problem or we would cancel our application.  Amazingly, we got a call from Shadow Ridge within ten minutes.  The woman to we spoke (Tiana) was incredibly condescending and not terribly helpful.  She explained that they were short-staffed due to covid; not surprising, but it was the first time we had received any explanation for why we had been unable to move forward with the lease.  We talked through the issues and were told that they would send the documents to us shortly.  During the call, we were, once again, placed on hold for at least 20 minutes.  We both thought that our call would be dropped before she came back on the line.  It wasn’t, making us believe that all of the other dropped calls were done purposely.  Once the lease documents were straightened out, we asked to confirm the price for the unit.  Shockingly, it was different from the price we had been quoted when we started to apply for the lease.  We expressed our objection to the change and to the way we were being treated.  Tania's response was to exclaim that we were being rude, and that if we continued to object, she would end the call.  To be clear, the difference wasn’t significant, but it was enough that when combined with the customer service problems we were already experiencing, we decided to withdraw our application and requested a refund of the application fees.  She said she could not process that refund and had to go through JRK Holding’s Tenant Relations department.
We immediately called JRK Tenant Relations and to nobody’s surprise, we got a voicemail box.  We left a message and requested a return call.  We contacted the manager, Brandy and she said that they had processed our request immediately.  We would be getting $250 less than the actual deposit per the contract. I was unhappy given that we cancelled because of their poor customer service and rudeness but it was a contract, so fine. At least they were willing to give us the $150 we are owed back.  Despite email from Brandy that she had processed, I have received no check to date.
To date, we have not received a call from the Tenant Relations department.  We have called Shadow Ridge and JRK no less than 10 times, sent emails, and left messages requesting a response.  We never received a refund from JRK or Shadow Ridge.
Shadow Ridge’s customer service is among THE WORST. I’ve had a had a root canal better than this experience.</text><user_id>100556235662977613705<//user_id><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><Time>1593875875935<//Time>< name>

<review>**Modern Elegance and Convenience**

My husband and I enjoyed our stay at the Heathman in downtown Portland. After getting our bearings, we realized we could walk to just about everything, which was great. The staff were tremendously friendly and helpful. I love the offering of a local brew upon check-in! We also took advantage of the "text concierge," which immediately handled our requests for towels and tissues. The hotel was still under construction, but it did not discourage our visit one bit.</review><gmap_id>0x80c2bb676ae8a897:0xfc5d93b5ea1901a5</gmap_id><UserId.>109829673434071424291</UserId.><response>{'time': 1529635378460, 'text': 'Thanks for writing us a review!

I came home on November 23 to a sewer backup. It has been defined as a category 3 water loss. I cannot any returned calls from JRK Properties regarding this. My apartment is uninhabitable and has black mold. Sewer, food and chemicals line the kitchen floor, appliances, carpet and my personal belongings. My son is coming home from the Army for Christmas and I am living in a hotel. No tree, no healthy home to come home to. Please help me get this fixed and moved back home.< /Review>

<text>For anyone reading this review who has also been defrauded by this company please contact me.

Asia Clayborne via Social media or
Email asia @ rainskyhome . com I will also be contacting those who have left reviews under similar circumstances concerning the following: After nearly two months of attempting to contact this property, the “manager” Keyona, and their management company “JRK Holdings regarding the return of my $400 deposit I am leaving this review to document the total incompetence and fraudulent practices of the company in compliance with the Management team at Notting Hill Apartments. It is my full belief this property, lured in potential renters during the Global Pandemic, with “lease specials”, with no intent to lease units to those who applied. This is what you call a money grab. When taking note of my experience along with several others who have left (authentic) reviews within the past two months, it is clear that this is an on going scheme to collect thousands of dollars in “returnable” deposit fees, with no intent to return the money. The management team alongside JRK holdings are with holding dozens of renters deposits that I am aware of and who knows how many others.

My representation contacted the property, and finally got ahold of Keyona, who then hung up the call when she realized what the matter was at hand. We also attempted to contact their legal department and recorded a call that again reeder of fraudulent “run around”.

Any further attempts to contact this property; you will be transferred to an offsite marketing company called Entrada, who screens their calls and messages for potential lease holders.

When researching this property and management ; it is clear the fraudulent practices don’t just stop at the lease inquiry. They have zero social media presence and have disabled the ability for anyone to leave a review. You will also notice on google
and other review sites once those negative reviews are made an influx of positive reviews will follow. These are fraudulent.

I will be moving forward with collecting my deposit as well as damages for fraud with all parties involved and have documented every call log made by myself and representation. I will seek out others who have also experienced the same.

Again: For anyone reading this review who has also been defrauded by this company please contact me and continue to contact this property and document every interaction moving forward.

Asia Clayborne via Social media or
Email asia @ rainskyhome . com

This is not simply a matter of corporate responsibility when the on-site management is also complicit in the fraud practices and will be named as well. They have full access to contact JRK, return emails, phone calls, and have instead dodged called and emails regarding the return. This shows intent to defraud beyond a doubt.<//text>< Pictures>

Possibly the worst customer service company in the US.  Note the extreme "5's" (probably from company employees), and the "1's" speaking the truth.  Avoid renting or living on their properties.  Well dressed thieves is what they are.  Very little integrity and seemingly zero care in dealing with issues. They only want your money -

STAY AWAY

WOULD RATE ZERO IF I COULD.</Review>

<Text>Very disappointed. Former resident at Westcliff Aartments in CO. I moved out Nov. 2, 2019. It is now June 2020 and I have not received any of my security deposit back. Lease specifically states you will receive it back within 60 days of move-out.....well we are now going on 7 months! No one in the office there returns my calls or emails. Calling JRK direct only gets you forwarded to a voice mailbox. Pretty ridiculous! Out of all of the apartments I have lived at, their administration is not trustworthy.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

There’s no irrigation or mulch there for roots get no moisture in the summer and they freeze in the winter. We finally have maintenance workers who work.

This is by far the worst property management company I have ever dealt with. Before that come behind this comment let say that I have only been a  resident at Notting Hill Apts, in Dunwoody, GA 3 months, it has been the worst experience. I typically give a full 6 months before offering a review. I have been extremely patient. It is already stressful relocating from another state, but to add to the stress, I was moved into an unfinished apartment, and when I made the maintenance management aware, he was gracious enough to get things fixed right away.  While I understand the current time, we have all been under quarantine, some of the work may have had to stop, it does not excuse the Resident relations office, or the corporate office from servicing customer. I literally called the resident relations office EVERY OTHER DAY the month of April and finally Tiffany in the leasing office placed me on hold to walk over the resident relations office to get some one to take my call. THAT IS RIDICULOUS!!!!  The resident relations office was unable to return my calls, or emails, but had no issue with emailing residents about a stimulus check  and what they can do with it. It's pandemic, people have lost jobs and income, $1200 is not paying their rent!! It is so out of place and insensitive of this company.   Sad thing is, the property is beautiful, its the service that is creating an awful experience. I email the corporate office in April, and STILL have not heard back from them. I called and a lady name Jessica answered the phone and she immediately hung up the phone, I called back and got the JRK Holdings voicemail. So yes it was the right number.  All these praises I see in the reviews are  not all real. I should have listened to the bad reviews I read, but I wanted to give this property a chance because it offered everything I was looking for. It is really sad that as a new resident this is my experience and I do not see it improving. I can't even get general information from the office.  I will not recommend anyone leasing at Notting Hill Apartments in Dunwoody, GA or with any property this company owns.  FYI I called 3x  today to simply ask about actually upgrading since I am stuck in this place, couldn't even get some one on the phone for that.</Text>

<Review>The work is easy once you learn the ropes at JRK Property Holdings. This company is fiscally conservative which means you never have to worry about large lay offs. The management staff is fair. The office environment like most places can be political up close. Overall I really enjoy working there.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1545297027330, 'text': 'Thank you for the review!'}<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Stay away from this company . I currently reside at one of their property in silverdale , WA. The property formerly known as Santa Fe ridge. The office staff is only nice to until you move in. They are also very sketchy and will charge you fees that were never discussed or disclosed . The maintenance team is very unprofessional and have no training in their job. Seems like people they hired off the street with no maintenance experience or training. The office team won’t acknowledge you when you walk in. They pretend to be busy. They gossip about the residents and they screen calls so they don’t answer phone calls from the current residents. It’s sad as most of their residents are active duty and we all sacrifice so much for this country but get apartments like this where the staff is disrespectful and lazy and Rips off your money . They also will not give your deposit back and we’ll find anyway of keeping it even when you pass the inspection. My advise is record your inspections when you move out.  Brittany is by far the worst at the silver ridge office she has no idea of How run a front desk but I’m not surprised as this company seems to only hire unqualified people. Stay away from them !</Review>

<Review>Do not believe the 5 stars fake reviews, they're probably all made up.

JRK is the worst "management" group you want to work with.

They couldn't even manage themselves.</Review>< userid>

Renters beware:

After a year and a half, and I should have gotten out when my lease ended in the first apartment. The first unit move in experience was horrible. We moved into a unit that didn't have a deadbolt lock on the door, holes in the walls from things that the previous resident had hung, and a huge hole in the ceiling from a water leak, filthy carpets which also included damage from pets and needed stretched and paint was spilled on the carpet, master bath tub needed resurfaced from horrid stains from the AC backup drain which was rusted and left rust all over the tile, poop was backed up in the master bathroom toilet, food stains all over the kitchen walls and ceiling, the exhaust fan didn't work, the plastic piece at the top of the microwave was broken, the kitchen sink leaked, our dryer was not hooked up correctly, we didn't have a mailbox key for two months, no garage keys, and had to replace our storage room deadbolt ourselves because they had no keys for that as well. Over time there was a rodent problem and I found dead mice in the storage room. I patched all the holes myself and out of my own pocket, constantly had to clean the rust drip stains from the backup AC pipe that seemed to always be leaking, and when our dryer was fixed, there was a huge spark that flew from the dryer to the carpet and caused permanent damage to the carpet. We also were woken up at 2am one morning because our smoke detectors had malfunctioned, and it turned out the fire department said that the smoke detectors should have been replaced a long time ago due to the age of them.

At the end of the lease, I decided to move into a one bedroom apartment, which required a transfer. My move in for the second apartment was better than my first one but still had issues. The day of my move in was scheduled on a Saturday, in which I was informed a few days prior that they did not do move ins on a Saturday. I then had to change all moving arrangements last minute to Friday, which cost me an extra day's rent with no notice. The day of my move in, I could not move in as the carpets were being cleaned after I received my keys. I had to change my moving arrangements back to Saturday because of this. Once I was able to move in, there were stains in the carpet, after being cleaned, light bulbs were out, which I replaced myself, and the garage remote did not work. I did not have a garage for a week, and when I finally received my garage, there was a hole in the wall, into the garage next to mine, and both light bulbs inside were burnt out. I have requested they fix these issues multiple times since September, and it is now January and they keep changing my status of my maintenance request to "fixed". After transferring, I had received notice that I owed money towards the first apartment because I did not get the carpets cleaned. Jana had told me she would take it off, since the carpets were not cleaned prior to my original move in, nor were they stretched at all after my multiple attempts to request maintenance to fix this issue. Because the issue was never fixed during my time in this apartment she had agreed to reverse this and call the company they use for collections. After receiving a second collections notice, I went back and spoke with Victoria who had pulled Jana aside and asked her about it, in which I was told would be taken care of. The third time I went in a spoke with Jordan, who pulled up my transactions and said it looked like it was reversed on the complex's end but would follow up with Jana about the collections end. He took a copy of the letter and wrote my info down. Then I received notice weeks later that it finally affected my credit score. At this point, Jana, Jordan, and Victoria no longer work for JRK. I spoke with the new manager, Brandy, and explained my situation and what has been going on. Brandy informed me that what I thought was the "reversal" was actually a "write off" to the collections agency. She gave me the number to JRK's resident hotline.

JRK will not return my calls.</review>

I assisted several senior management personnel and found the overall management style to be motivating, engaging, and thought-provoking. The company is fairly large with about 200 on-site staff and 1,000 off-site staff. I enjoy working with them, both individually and collectively.

The hardest part of the job is assisting several other senior management while working primarily for the CEO to meet his deadlines and mitigate day-to-day issues. The most enjoyable part of the job is the personal satisfaction I receive from meeting challenges and exceeding expectations.< /Text>

I have had an awful time getting in contact with corporate. I’ve reached out several times over the last couple of months with no response. I live in Notting hill apartments in Georgia. I was moved into an unfinished apartment that they still haven’t fixed. I just want to resolve my issues and move forward! The staff does not seem to care!< /Text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>As I live in a JRK property I know those recent 5 star reviews are fake.

No JRK property I've seen could be described as "beautiful" and the 2 stars I gave to my property were earned by the on site staff trying to deal with the lack of support from this home office.  Home Office is rude, they cajoled their way into my apartment for an unannounced additional "inspection" when I had a babysitter over, rudely stepping over the children like they were objects on the floor, not human beings.

JRK cares nothing for their residents and organizes coordinated dishonest advertising campaigns (as evidenced by the shotgun of 5 star reviews "three weeks ago" (adjust for the age of this review) by never before used accounts all calling JRK properties "beautiful"). They feel their responsibility ends at the point of you signing the lease.

Please check out my review for the current nightmare of an experience I'm having in Colorado at The Courtyards at Buckley.

JRK are jerks.<//Text><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c2bb676ae8a897:0xfc5d93b5ea1901a5< /GmapID><user_id>117915208144613787107</user_id><rating>1</rating>< time>

< review>
I just moved at one of JRK properties on August 30. It was a good experience moving in as they have few amenities I enjoy. However after today’s experience with one of the office manger named Inez I will never recommend the place till she is employed there. I am a 59 year old adult and have never felt this degraded and disrespected by this young person .
I hope the send her to a client service training class and teach her some manners how to deal with clients
I am an owner of 3 homes and haven’t. Experience apartment life in 25 years.as I have been here only 2 months not fully aware of their rent procedure
Due to being Sunday on 3rd and office closed I went to pay rent at 10:30 finding 2 young ladies hanging out with one so called manger INEZ on the phone for 10 minutes and not even acknowledging that I am there. She then proceeds to keep talking on the phone and closes the door in my face and close the blinds
I believe I am stuck here till my lease but I will not recommend to rent here as she was disrespectful to A senior. Citizen.</review>

The team is amazing at JRK Property Holdings. Everyone is willing to assist whenever necessary and is willing to teach you so that new skills can be added to your personal tool belt. JRK is understanding to its employees and, especially working Part Time, is willing to work around school schedules to ensure that education always comes first.

At times micromanaging becomes quite annoying and the push to keep up with the numbers sometimes loses the main goal of providing a wonderful customer experience. Customers can also be quite harsh to say the least.< /Review>

JRK Property Holdings is by far, one of the best places anyone could ever be employed. The staff, managers, work colleagues, benefits, vacation time, and the overall work atmosphere is the absolute BEST!

<text>BROKEN AC IN THE SUMMER IN GA, THANKS! Won't provide my apartment complex (Belmont Place) with enough maintenance staff to fix major issues like AC. I have only seen one maintenance staff member (Walter whom I sure deserves a raise) for a complex with 326 units!!!! My AC has been broken since I moved into their "community" which I chose because of their 48 hour maintenance guarantee. By the way it's about 1700 a month haha. JRK won't return my calls. The guy who handles tenant relations is out of town. One guy handles it?!!?  Temperatures are unsafe for my pets and I have received zero rent concessions. Will be reporting this to the Better Business Bureau today. Some reviews indicate this is a great place to work but do you want to work for a place that gets to where they are by being cheap and hurting the little guy? Their reply below I sure will list the number to a corporate office that won't return my call.</text>< pictures>

<Text>Centreport Lake Luxury Apartments

It's the worst place. The carpet is filthy. Less than 1 month after we moved in our carpet look like this. The manager said we should have said something earlier and gave me the carpet cleaner number and we have paid $60 ever other month. WE HAVE NEVER WORN SHOES and have little company. We were told it would  be replaced so we signed a new lease and then they said it was only 3 years old. My point was what does that matter if it SOILED.

Grounds are not kept.

Pool is dirty water not clear.

Cabanas have mold, disorganized

No furniture in Gazebo stolen before summer

Hallways smells like garbage Valet garbage?

To top it off they created 6 Visitors spots for parking when there aren't enough spaces for tenants already. If you park in those spots you get towed. Why are they making it easy for VISITORS and we pay to live here.

Lastly pool tables, theater and kitchen are not available if you work a day job because by the time you get off work they're closed. If you want to use the oven to keep your food warm  the ride guy In the office says you can't because they don't want to smell your food in the building. The management before welcome us to use it.

Management is horrible and the great Maintenance staff quit because of poor wages.

I have left multiple messages over the course of a year and I have never once received a call back from tenant relations.

Then when I call the main line and tell the people there that no one ever picks up at tenant relations, the people on the main line get rude with me, and I didn't even have a complaint.< /text>< Pics>

I really enjoyed working with a great team of peers. I started from the bottom and worked my way up. Learned a lot and taught myself a lot, very hands on. Tried new things. Figured out what worked and what didn't. I made a lot of close contacts by going out of my way and helping people.< /Text>< Pics>

< review>
My family lived in the Serenade apartments from 2014 - 2017. The apartments were nice and area was convenient. The property management that was there three years ago when we moved in were friendly and helpful. However, the new management that is currently there is anything but helpful. We are trying to dispute our move out charges since the property management is not following California Law for three year tenants. We have not been contacted even though I have tried contacting for weeks now and have the emails to show for it. I tried calling with no luck either. I contacted the corporate office directly still with no success. I sent a letter USPS that was tracked and showed delivered. It has been over three months since we have moved out and have not been contacted. This property management is a joke and unbelievable.  I am going to keep pursuing this until it is properly fixed, legally.< /review>

The staff welcomes you at first, after you sign the lease, they immediately change to a unprofessional group of individuals.   The Manager (Larissa)  is very rude, she makes you feel very uncomfortable.  We've been here, (El Paso, The Retreat) for almost a year now and cannot wait to move out.  Our experience here was not what we expected.</text>

JRK Property Holdings are not customer oriented and are only interested of taking advantage of customers. Their property in Marietta was not cleaned properly and we had several major issues prior to moving in. They refused to fix the issues in addition to refusing to refund our hefty deposit. Looks good on the outside but the customer service and business practices are HORRIBLE!<//Text>

I recently moved out of a JRK Holdings property because it was so poorly managed.  I was charged for electric utilities even though I showed them proof that I already payed it through the electric company.  Every time I go in to get an update they have no clue because they can't do anything.  They say corporate has to do it and I have called the corporate number 8 times and have yet to receive a call back.  Also, I moved out on April 5th and still haven't received my deposit back.  So, basically they owe me over $600 and I can't even talk to someone one that can fix the issue.  In the short time (4 months) I was at The Terraces in Highland Park in Sacramento, they had 4 new property managers.  Tells you a lot about the company.  Next step for me I guess will be a law suit, which I am sure I won't be their first.  When they say call the corporate number that just means you will get a voicemail to leave your name and number.  Guess what, you will never get a call back.  EVER!< /text>

<user>108898511927123204540<//user><text>Having issues with the greens of salem run in Fredericksburg va. Reached out to this company to try to get resolution and instead got ignored and blown off. Was not given a walk through of the facility, was made to sign my lease electronically on my cell phone as I was heading to the facility, couldn't read the lease and even explained that to the greens when I got there.. they couldn't offer me a copy of the lease until a few days later. Ten minutes after getting my keys my son and myself were touring our apartment for the first time when we saw CAR AIR FRESHNERS. Hanging up trying to mask the weird smell inside the townhome. My son who has extreme difficulty breathing had to have his nose covered the whole time. 10 mins into waiting for comcast to come hook up we physically watched a drug deal commence in front of out home. Of course I was on the phone with comcast so before I could hang up to call the cops they had left the premises.  The windows are all drafty and leak air, the thermostat was not operating properly,  basically we are paying for a home we dont feel safe or comfortable living in . Would think there would be professionalism but I'm guessing not.< /text></record></dataset><record>

My duties were interesting because you don't only have one position when it comes to Team work. Being able to work for the restaurant, translate for the front desk, and help in the kitchen always makes your day worth it as you are helping and serving the customers. Very happy to have a job with JRK.< /Text>

JRK Property Holdings has provided me the opportunity to assist both managers and customers. Responsibilities included greeting customers both in person and on the phone. Other clerical duties included using Microsoft systems, inter-office and U.S. mail. I definitely enjoy interacting with others and problem-solving to meet their needs.< /Review>

JRK is a fantastic place to work. I've been able to grow into an entirely new role without leaving my team. Two levels of managers above me have been going out of their way to help me progress my career, including asking about my career desires, suggesting new projects to build those skills, and giving me time to grow in those skills.

Although this place is fantastic, there are some cons just like any other workplace. You have to deal with very rude clients on a daily basis and everyday is super fast paced!<//review>

<name>Jamal Wembleton< /name><text>I have gained so much more knowledge and experience during the time that I have spent working at JRK then I ever would have at my previous jobs. The other people that I work with are all very hard working and fun, which makes the days go by so much faster.

I would absolutely recommend JRK for anyone looking for a job, Because the complex that I work in is so large there are times when the amount of work can seem overwhelming. On any given day the work can vary from so many different types of jobs that it can become hard keeping track of who needs to be where.

However, our management is very good about sending us any additional people if we ever need them.<//text></record>

< review>
I moved into a JRK property back in April. I have been dissatisfied with the experience. I have had over 20 maintenance orders since moving in. I feel like there is no urgency to get things done for the tenant. I have tried calling the property company directly and not getting a response from anyone in tenant relations the lady that answers the phone is not very friendly or helpful. I have children and some of my request have affected my children and starting to take a toll on there physical well being. I'm so frustrated wondering if I should seek legal counsel.</review>

To be honest, the Holiday Inn Express wasn't my first choice, but the other places I tried were fully-booked. As it turned out, that was the best thing that could have happened. Our stay at the Holiday Inn Express couldn't have been better. The room, on the newly-renovated fourth floor, was spacious, clean, quiet, and extremely comfortable. We had a king bed, which was as comfortable as any bed I've ever slept in, including our bed at home. The bathroom was equally spacious and clean, with good water pressure in the shower. And there was live music every afternoon.< /review>

Have been trying to get in contact with someone from resident relations since before Christmas. My ac was broken for over a month and the property manager acted like she was doing us a favor by even speaking to us.

I’ve left multiple voicemails, emails, and even reached out on social media. This company’s “resident relations” is an absolute joke. I would not recommend renting at any of their property’s to anyone.</Text>

I canceled auto withdraw, and they still look out the full amount! This was BS! I left messages every time never got a call back, I emailed them on their website as well! I was told I was going to get $691 back and they sent me a check for $628! Again BS! The worst property company out there!!!  Oh and too top it off it took 3 months to get some of my money back! Avoid living at their communities at all costs! Terrible, Terrible, Terrible, (At least the gals at Westcliff tried, but to no avail)</Review>< pics>

<Review>JRK Property and Westcliff Apartments in Westminster colorado are a huge Joke. I moved out of my apartment in August and it is December and i have still not recieved my full deposit back. I have called mutiple time and everyone says they are going to call back and never do. When i call corperate they transfer me to a line that no one has picked up or returned my calls. At this point they are holding my money from me and they are going to be recieveing a law suit. Avoid this compay if at all possible.</Review>< Pictures>

Thank you JRK I absolutely love my apartment home here Chase Arbors!  If anyone is searching for a quiet and safe neighborhood to call home, this is your place! They have different floor plans which include spacious one and two bedrooms. The community is always clean and the impeccable landscaped grounds is absolutely stunning.<//Text>

<Review>From the business model to the culture, I'm so impressed and pleased to be working here at JRK Property Holdings. Fast growth often leaves our organization struggling to keep up with the demands of the business.
My favorite part about working at JRK is my co-workers and the management. My directors are very approachable and easy to talk to!<//Review>< UserId.>

After my recent stay in Manhattan, I was so impressed with my stay at The Roger Hotel that I had to write a review for it. Having never been to New York before I feel like the trip could have gone completely differently if I had chosen a different hotel to stay at. The rooms were elegantly styled, but had all of the modern amenities that one would want. Also, I was so impressed with the restaurant that I ate there multiple times!<//text>

I have been contacted this office numerous times and left voicemails requesting call backs. I am simply requesting a reimbursement for an administrative fee that was paid, prior to my job relocation. I was approved. However, due to my job relocation, I did not complete the applicant process. There were no check stubs provided to the local property. There was no apartment held for me. Therefore, the admin fee is due back to me. I have not received any communications from JRK Property Holdings. This issue has been drawn out by the local property and not assessed at all by JRK Property Holdings, who has been contacted by their local property (Notting Hill Apartments). I have received no followup, update, email reply, or call from Notting Hill Apartments or JRK Property Residential regarding this matter. I am not quite sure why this is.  However, it is extremely unprofessional and inconveniencing.</text>

Hospital Front Desk

I have been working at a JRK managed hotel for a few years now as the front desk clerk. The job is really rewarding as I get to work with people that are in a good mood. When people check into a hotel, they are inherently happy--so that makes life easy. I enjoy being the first person to deal with guests and overall, I think that makes the job a fun one. The benefits are good and the salary isn't bad either.   8 - )< /review>

JRK stinks! One example, they take over management of Park place of Northville in August 2017 and turned one of the nicest places to live in SE Michigan to a miserable place for residents. In less than a year google ratings of this nice community nosed down from 4.4 to 2.9. I tried to call their LA head office multiple times and left my contact info several times but I got no response back.<//Review>

The Roger was a wonderful surprise, I booked it because it was a great deal on Expedia, then I wanted to cancel because I was unfamiliar with the area it is in and I was there to move my daughter into her dorm at NYU. It ended up being a wonderful hotel, really nice hardworking staff, it is clean and safe and a has a wonderful comforting feeling when you walk in the door!</Review>

<Text>I have lived at Westcliff apartments for almost 2 years now.  It's a safe neighborhood and good area to live in.  The floor plans are spacious.  That's about all the positives I have though.

I was told I would be getting new carpet when I signed my lease.  On day of move in, the manager told me they decided NOT to put new carpet in my place without ever notifying me.

The office has a very high turn over rate.  Most of the office staff are rude and passive aggressive.

This place is far from luxury as the signs state, and charges way too much for what they actually provide.  They went up over 10% on my rent when I renewed my lease.

People do not pick up after their dogs, and half the time they aren't on a leash either and come running up to you.  The trash compactor at the back of the neighborhood is constantly overflowing, its the ONLY trash in the neighborhood.  The dog park is falling to pieces and has gotten worse since I originally moved in.  Maintenance likes to close your maintenance requests even though they were never completed. Their 48 hour guarantee they advertise?  Don't count on it. There is no point in complaining to the office about anything because they don't care, and half of the time don't bother replying back to you either.  I left numerous voicemails at corporate too, and no one there ever bothered to call me back.

UPDATE 7/23/19:  Teri the manager at the office today told me to "stop talking" when I came in to talk about about a maintenance request not being fixed after 3 weeks(and I dropped by her office several times to mention it over the 3 weeks).  She blatantly told me that other customers without AC are more important than bugs crawling in under my door and my AC seeping out below the door due to weatherstripping that needs to be replaced.  I used to like her, but now?  Uh no way.  Sorry Teri, you aren't the boss of me, I don't stop when you tell me to stop, and you really should learn customer service.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Whenever I find myself getting ready for a small getaway up the coast to San Francisco I always make my hotel accommodations with the Villa Florence. The entire hotel projects an ambiance of class that you can feel from the time that you pull up in front, then continues into the lobby, and extends to each individual room. The staff is consistently courteous and hospitably in the most professional way possible. I would definitely recommend to anyone the they stay at this hotel if they ever went to the bay area.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>Avoid any property owned by JRK Property Holdings!
I live in a complex in Colorado where Several buildings have water damage and mold. They repaint and cover it up so you don't see it when you move in. In April we started having water leak into our apt in our livingroom every time it rained or snowed. We let the apts know but they did nothing about it. Once the paint started peeling you could see the water damage and mold. I have pics and video of the waterfall that my livingroom wall becomes when it rains or snows and I live on the 2nd floor of a 3 floor building! The ceiling, baseboards and floor are rotten and molded. We have been asking since May to be moved to another unit or let out of our lease but they have continuously refused and its now December.
They had some workers here doing work on the outside wall of our building. They put a huge hole (almost 2'x2') through our livingroom wall. The home caused the built in shelves to fall and broke our computer and other things. That was almost 2 months ago and they still have not repaired the hole even though they told us 5 times that someone would be here. We have to keep our thermostat set super high just to keep the apt warm. And they will not replace the computer.
On top of all this our rent is supposed to be $1420 but we have never paid less than $1600 and if we renew our lease (which we absolutely will not) the rent will be increasing by over $150/mo on this apt which is uninhabitable by Colorado statute. The pool and hot tub are constantly broken. There is only one dumpster for the entire complex so there are always bags of trash all over the grounds near the dumpster piled so high you can't even get to the dumpster. The gates to the "gated community" are always broke so anyone can come in anytime. Our garage was broken into twice and they won't do anything about it and even said we would have to pay to fix the garage door.
The office staff is nice but the complex is owned by JRK Property Holdings in Los Angeles California and the staff have no ability to do anything without approval from JRK who are slumlords and don't take care of their property or tenants. Avoid any property owned by JRK!<//Text>< user_name>

Worst customer service ever! Do not rent any of their apartment!
I am living in their property in Northville, MI, and I emailed them about many problems that their management caused to us and they never responded to that.
I also called them 100 times and always it goes to answering machine and no callback.
I rented an apartment, paid everything, got the key and went to the apartment and it was full of trash and middle of renovation! + 3-month problem with broken living room frame, etc.< /text>

Hideaway at Greenbrier is the best apartment complex to lose your money. They have the laziest most unhelpful staff you cant find anywhere else. The monthly rent is higher than a mortgage, the expense of Valet Trash service is really garbage and on top of that there’s hidden fees. What really put the icing on the cake is when they charged my security deposit $80 carpet clean, $50 touch up and $50 other touch up, after my lease ended and I left the apartment clean. They’re excuse for the charge were pictures with small dirts on the floor, dust on the stove top and a water stain on the bathroom mirror. This place is very unprofessional and are quick to make a buck. I’ve called JRK, there’s never anyone who can resolve my issue, just an answering machine to leave a message that hasn’t been replied to. Oh yea JRK you owe me $4, I need that since we being petty.<//review>

It has been a dream of mine for some time to move to Colorado. Recently everything seemed to align perfectly to allow me to finally make to move, and I could not be happier with where I am living. Being so close to the National Parks was one of the selling points of the complex for me. The grounds are very nice looking, and I love the way that the apartments are designed. I would recommend the Governor’s Park to anyone looking a place to live in Fort Collins.< /review>

Our garage door has been broken for weeks and cannot get a company out to fix it. The leasing office has their hands tied with only being allowed to use 1 company per JRKs rules. Weeks have gone by and still a broken, unusable garage door. I pay too much money at this poorly managed property to have a broken garage door.
Sprinklers are broken everywhere, so the majority of grass is dying. Looks so trashy. But of course the sprinklers at the leasing office are on all the time! Looks appealing to the eye until you take one step into this complex.
It's a "gated" community but the gates are broken every other week. Poorly maintained buildings and cheaply made.
Trash is a constant problem. 1 dumpster for and ENTIRE complex. It is constantly overflowing. The trash bins at the mail boxes are over flowing with dog waste bags and trash. See the pictures I have attached!
The dog waste bins are always full and over flowing and normally always out of baggies. The bugs are always a problem due to the overflow of trash everywhere.
I can never get anyone to answer the phone, but when I walk in everyone is sitting there. Can't take a phone call?
Where and what exactly are my HOA fees going towards?? Obviously not maintenance of the property! Ridiculous.
Do yourselves a favor and stay away from any property owned by them.
I find it absurd that this company is only responding to the very few positive comments. Why not address the bad ones and resolve some of these peoples problems?</Review><user_name>Alli Cummings< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

Awesome experience! Have lived at a JRK building for three years now and have had zero complaints. I pay my rent on time and the place is kept clean and safe. Our leasing manager Megan is really nice and super helpful. The couple times I had minor issues she was able to rectify it quickly and promptly. A+++ service!< /Review>

I learned a lot on how JRK executes business practices in fluid and collaborative ways without getting bogged down in paperwork. The Management Team is highly technical, they could provide feedback for challenging solutions and guidance on how to wrangle them.

Excellent Compensation and Benefits. Collaborative work environment is wonderful.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQTa4GeJ4B4b8gaVcRd-ENVhfFUlpwPTi2bF4t=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>{'time': 1524707189927, 'text': 'Thank you very much for leaving us a review!'}</response><gmapID>0x80c2bb676ae8a897:0xfc5d93b5ea1901a5</gmapID></record>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Just moved to Park Place at Northville, MI.  if there was an option to give NO STARS! I would. The level of incompetence in this place has no bounds. They first assigned me the wrong apartment then lost some of my Wayfair furniture that they promised they will move to the reassigned apartment. The new apartment was anything but ready but by then I had already let my old apartment so it was either take it or leave it. New apartment carpet is so old that I am stepping on the nails beneath the carpet all the time. The wall holding the door chain is about to fall off so I no longer use the security chain. Balcony is literally falling apart and nails sticking out every where.  Finally may mailbox has been broken into and it has been a week and two visits to the office and the mail box is still not fixed. NO ONE takes ownership of ANY mistake in the office. The will dismiss your concerns and go about their business. Called LA and no answer to my messages. I guess poor management at the top radiates in this place downward!</Text>< pictures>

I have seen my grow in leaps and bounds since I have began working in this position, and it can all be attributed to the immense amount of help that I have received from my management team.

There are definitely moments when the job became incredibly busy and overwhelming, all of which can be attributed to an extremely high volume of customers.

<review>I called today to discuss issues I've had since I moved into one of their properties only to be told that there is only 1 person that deals with tenant relations and they have no idea when I will receive a call back. The lady said it could be 2 weeks and if I dont receive a call back I should call back in two weeks.

Seriously? I just moved in 4 days ago and my apartment wasn't ready. And was dirty even after they sent someone to re-clean it. Pot holes literally everywhere and the trash compactor is always blocked. Trash all over the property, not enough parking and people parking their company vehicles there taking the only parking available for residents.

My keys do not even work for my apartment and they gave me one of their office spares. I have to go make ones for me.

This is the worst experience I have ever had. I pay a lot of money here and I think it's so disappointing that I have had all these issues. The manager did give me money off my move in but I am so worried I am going to hate where I live for the next year.

All these issues only to be told to call back in two weeks??!?!<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1555575309704, 'text': 'Very sorry for your bad experience.

When you are a family with two children and a dog, that cannot afford to rent a house your options are pretty limited on places that can accommodate everything we need. Fortunately for us though, Hibben Ferry turned out to be the perfect place for us. This complex boasts an off-lease dog park and a children’s play area that both my children and our dog love! Also, the grounds are incredibly beautiful, and we frequently the kids and dog on walks around the complex and out to the docks. This complex was an absolute godsend when we drastically had to look for a place to accommodate children and pets, and I would recommend it to any other families.<//Review>

These people are willing to leave you homeless during their buyout. As a company who tries to sell HOMES to people it really shows their true colours. This is regarding Apex Hudson Riverfront  .....I know first hand being their first poor victim (Apt 401). I have documented their entire process and their baffling 'add on' charges. Only place In my life that i have ever been made to pay for the actual keys to access the apartment. Avoid these people if they operate this way.

Update. They reached out pretending to sound concerned on the bad reviews and asking to contact them. I did just that and never heard anything back .... not even a returned call from them.

We continue to give honest reviews of JRK's incompetence to potential new tenants to save them from the pain< /Text>

Such a blessing to have found JRK back in 2013. I had been laid off from my previous employer and was in desperate need of work. I didn't know anything about property management but started on the ground floor (no pun intended) and gradually worked my way up to a property manager. JRK gave me the tools I needed to be successful and for that I'll always be grateful. Thank you with all my heart!!</Text>

The last one is going on 3 weeks late and still not "approved" meaning if we get it, it will be almost a month late. No one at corporate ever answers or returns calls or emails. Proper invoice processing is non existent here. They just ignore you and theres nothing you can do except file suit which is nearly a waste of time and money as they could just send you a very LATE check before court. Thousands of dollars from this place was NEVER on time yet I've worked for 6 other properties who all paid on time or better. They don't care!!!!! Unless you dont care when you get your money (months!!!!), I would watch out!!!! Also lots of issues at the particular property in question but that's not either here nor there!!! Just beware!! We are not the onlt vendor with this issue. Even the property manager admitted this is "typical" for this place.<//Review><UserId.>113080055021452124631<//UserId.><user_name>Kelsey Alexander</user_name><time>1561391051826<//time>< Response>

<user_name>John Bartell< /user_name><text>Interesting corporate policies?

About a month ago one of my kids applied (along with a roommate) to this company for an apartment. First they hit them with a $55 per person application fee (cost for credit bureau full background checks are typically about $30 - so there is some extra money for their "time"), but then came the other fees! A $205 dollar "administrative" fee (what is that for?), Utility transfer fee $25 (they don't own the utility - the utility company transfers the account - but they still have a charge), Fitness key fee $35 (keys cost about $2) ALL THESE FEES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE. By the time they were through, together they were out about $350, only to be told 2 days before move in day that they were not approved. Up to almost the last moment The office persons repeatedly said  "we can't wait for you to move in", "we're really excited to have you here".

This business is preying on the tight rental market and creating a revenue stream from applications instead of providing housing. Charging outrageous, unjustifiable fees to persons that can least afford it. Think of how this affects the people who apply. very quickly a person would spend hundreds of dollars for bogus fees then they can't afford their first months rent.

RUN THE OTHER DIRECTION.<//text>< Rate>

Finally found an apartment complex with a management company that isn't a bunch of jerks. The last few places I've lived in across the country were poorly managed. JRK has been an awesome company to deal with, from getting my lease constructed to helping me with a few cosmetic issues upon moving in. I pay my rent on time and don't complain, so maybe that's why I've had such an easy time.</Review>

I've been working at a hotel (remain nameless) in a JRK managed hotel for a couple of years now. Have really enjoyed my time here and for once, I feel appreciated. The experience has been rewarding and I'd suggest that anyone looking to get into hospitality get a job here.<//text>

I lived at a JRK managed apartment complex for a few years while going to school. I was always very pleased with the courteousness of their staff and the speed at which they fixed maintenance issues. The property was kept clean and I never had issues. It was great living somewhere where I didn't have to worry about all that adult stuff!</review>

I could not be any happier with the time that I have lived at The Boulders in Tacoma, WA! The facilities are absolutely beautiful and feature tons on amenities that are very useful. Washington can be particularly cold during the winter, but fortunately the complex offers an indoor pool, Jacuzzi, and gym. I would definitely recommend this as a place to live in Tacoma!<//review>

About a month ago one of my kids applied (along with a roommate) to this company for an apartment. First they hit them with a $55 per person application fee (cost for credit bureau full background checks are typically about $30 - so there is some extra money for their "time"), but then came the other fees! A $205 dollar "administrative" fee (what is that for?), Utility transfer fee $25 (they don't own the utility - the utility company transfers the account - but they still have a charge), Fitness key fee $35 (keys cost about $2) ALL THESE FEES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE. By the time they were through, together they were out about $350, only to be told 2 days before move in day that they were not approved. Up to almost the last moment The office persons repeatedly said  "we can't wait for you to move in", "we're really excited to have you here".

This business is preying on the tight rental market and creating a revenue stream from applications instead of providing housing. Charging outrageous, unjustifiable fees to persons that can least afford it. Think of how this affects the people who apply. very quickly a person would spend hundreds of dollars for bogus fees then they can't afford their first months rent.

RUN THE OTHER DIRECTION.<//text></record>

<text>Oh man, I have had an experience with apartments over the last decade. My experience spans from awesome complexes to utter rate holes. Over the lsat 3 years, I've been living in a complex that is managed by JRK and it's seriously the nicest complex I've ever lived in. If you have to rent (I do because I get moved a lot for work), there's nothing that beats a luxury apartment complex. JRK takes care of our needs and is constantly improving equipment in the gym, amenities, etc. It's like I live in a hotel, but it's an apartment. Awesome!< /text>< Gmap_id>

The specific issues that I had with JRK were with properties in Colorado. To start, I work in property management, both residential and commercial. I have never experience such incredible amounts of disrespect, incompetence, and flat our negligence, and this was just during the application process. I would hate to have to experience what the residents living at these communities are going through.

The leasing agent was dressed so unprofessionally, jeans and a tank top, and wouldn't even acknowledge people walking through the door. She continued to ask for copies of SSN's and drivers licenses multiple times, even though all the information was on the application. She mentioned that the applications were approved but she needed SSN and Driver license information again. She wanted copies emailed to her...Why would you need that information again if the application already came back approved? It was starting to feel very off. After reading several other reviews that mentioned scamming, things started to click. She tried to get the application/holding fees twice from us, stating that payment never went through even through the payment came out of the bank and we had bank statements to prove it. She tried to charge double the security deposit because she only screened one applicant at first, and wouldn't screen the other for days.

I was getting frustrated and called their corporate headquarters. No one answered, and I left a message explaining the situation and asked for a call back. I have yet to received a call back... Seems like they wanted to take the money and give us the run around, and if that was not the case, JRK you have a lot to work on.

We caught the agent purposefully ignoring our phone calls. She even hung up on us. The community was a perfect fit, however with the extreme lack of customer service we chose to look elsewhere for a home. Colorado has a very LARGE market of apartments, do not sacrifice customer service for beauty, trust me you can have both.

This was an identical experience I had with a JRK Property a year ago. I thought it was just that one location, but it sounds like this is a company standard.

Please do your research before moving into a JRK Community.< /review>

Easily the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  I lived at Citigate in Jacksonville, FL (those girls were great!) The moment I needed some assistance at move out from corporate regarding a hefty fine - my experience took a 180.  No one answers the phone. When they do, they just hang up on you (specifically Jessica). If you do get through to an extension, the mailbox is full, so there is no help anyway. I have sent emails - no reply. Literally called a dozen times, no answer.  If you want any sort of customer service beyond who rents you your apartment initially - STAY AWAY!</Review>

I had the complete circus-like experience of living in TerraMar in Santa Rosa Beach, Florida, for over a year, before I became the Leasing Assistant in the front office. What an eye opening experience it was... to say the least.  During my employment Shelly Marlin, was the Property Manager and then was promoted to Regional Manager. I observed more deceptive business practices and law breaking acts while employed there than I could have ever imagined. Applications were altered, lies were told to anyone and everyone who walked in to the office, company polices were not only NOT followed...they were completely ignored and broken, cash was taken from residents, and kept in Shelly's office,  this cash was for payments and this specific resident, Lee Fox... well...I continually saw him bring in his cash...also had the code to enter her office. The multiple car keying episodes that went on for months was a hush-hush topic, and we were not to tell any truth on what we knew, as employees. Like I said...a complete circus. The amount of fraud that I witnessed, was appalling.  As both a resident, and an employee there, I was told I would receive an employee discount, after I had worked 90 days. Well... imagine my surprise, when 30 days after my 90 days...still waiting on word for my discount...I was told that Christopher Murray, who is located in California and was Shelly's boss, had decided to go up on my rent, and then I could get an employee discount. Hmmm... It was so like them to NOT keep their word. What a great feeling of being valued,  I worked my tail off...most days without any break or lunch.  I did not ever receive any pay or compensation for hours each week that I had worked over. Funny how Shelly made sure that I was told that I would NOT be considered for re-hire, since I gave 13 days notice not 14. When no discount was going to be given to me... I resigned, with 13 days notice... I was never ever given a new lease, paid my rent on time every month, the increase amount was sent to me in a text, nothing in writing. On June 10th 2017, I received an eviction notice on my door from Brandi Polvado, who was the Property Manager at that time. I hired an attorney. No one would call my attorney back, no one would explain why I was being evicted, without a lease. I was also current on my rent each month.  They were all such fools from day one. I moved out August 2, 2017, received a collection notice, a few weeks later...I never got a bill, never received my deposit. Thankfully...JRK has a reputation here as does TerraMar.  Small towns listen to what people are saying.  Thank goodness there is another apartment that is new in the area.  Beware...use caution...and take time to read what other people have taken the time to share.  JRK and TerraMar are very similar to a $3 bill.  PHONY!!!<//Review>

<text>Been renting from these guys for 2 years now. Real top-notch operation and being a guy who's handy, I can tell what good craftsmanship looks like. There was this one time when my water heater was leaking and so I let my property manager know. She phoned a plumber who was at my apartment the next day. He was a licensed, bonded and insured plumber who clearly knew what he was doing. The gentleman took his time and then explained everything to me. We chatted about sports and was just a generally personable and likable dude. I applaud JRK for sending someone out that was so great and got the job done, the first time. So hard to find quality repairmen these days.< /text><gmapID>0x80c2bb676ae8a897:0xfc5d93b5ea1901a5< /gmapID>< username>

Moving here was one of the best decisions that I have ever made! When I moved from the San Gabriel Valley to Oxnard I was looking for a nice place that was close to what I had been paying as well as an upgrade. All the units I looked at were either over priced or looked sketchy. Serenade at Riverpark has provided a quiet and clean living experience. The management staff is great in answering my questions and providing any repairs on a timely and efficient basis The amenities in my apartment(central heating/air, refrigerator, dish washer and garage) make life much easier especially with my busy schedule. The 24 hour gym is also a great addition especially when you don't want to deal with over crowded neighborhood gyms. During the past two years that I have been living here I have been incredibly happy, and would recommend it to anyone!< /Review>

The specific issues that I had with JRK were with properties in Colorado. To start, I work in property management, both residential and commercial. I have never experience such incredible amounts of disrespect, incompetence, and flat our negligence, and this was just during the application process. I would hate to have to experience what the residents living at these communities are going through.

The leasing agent was dressed so unprofessionally, jeans and a tank top, and wouldn't even acknowledge people walking through the door. She continued to ask for copies of SSN's and drivers licenses multiple times, even though all the information was on the application. She mentioned that the applications were approved but she needed SSN and Driver license information again. She wanted copies emailed to her...Why would you need that information again if the application already came back approved? It was starting to feel very off. After reading several other reviews that mentioned scamming, things started to click. She tried to get the application/holding fees twice from us, stating that payment never went through even through the payment came out of the bank and we had bank statements to prove it. She tried to charge double the security deposit because she only screened one applicant at first, and wouldn't screen the other for days.

I was getting frustrated and called their corporate headquarters. No one answered, and I left a message explaining the situation and asked for a call back. I have yet to received a call back... Seems like they wanted to take the money and give us the run around, and if that was not the case, JRK you have a lot to work on.

We caught the agent purposefully ignoring our phone calls. She even hung up on us. The community was a perfect fit, however with the extreme lack of customer service we chose to look elsewhere for a home. Colorado has a very LARGE market of apartments, do not sacrifice customer service for beauty, trust me you can have both.

This was an identical experience I had with a JRK Property a year ago. I thought it was just that one location, but it sounds like this is a company standard.

Please do your research before moving into a JRK Community.</Text>

If you have to rent (I do because I get moved a lot for work), there's nothing that beats a luxury apartment complex.

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>I had the complete circus-like experience of living in TerraMar in Santa Rosa Beach, Florida, for over a year, before I became the Leasing Assistant in the front office. What an eye opening experience it was... to say the least.  During my employment Shelly Marlin, was the Property Manager and then was promoted to Regional Manager. I observed more deceptive business practices and law breaking acts while employed there than I could have ever imagined. Applications were altered, lies were told to anyone and everyone who walked in to the office, company polices were not only NOT followed...they were completely ignored and broken, cash was taken from residents, and kept in Shelly's office,  this cash was for payments and this specific resident, Lee Fox... well...I continually saw him bring in his cash...also had the code to enter her office. The multiple car keying episodes that went on for months was a hush-hush topic, and we were not to tell any truth on what we knew, as employees. Like I said...a complete circus. The amount of fraud that I witnessed, was appalling.  As both a resident, and an employee there, I was told I would receive an employee discount, after I had worked 90 days. Well... imagine my surprise, when 30 days after my 90 days...still waiting on word for my discount...I was told that Christopher Murray, who is located in California and was Shelly's boss, had decided to go up on my rent, and then I could get an employee discount. Hmmm... It was so like them to NOT keep their word. What a great feeling of being valued,  I worked my tail off...most days without any break or lunch.  I did not ever receive any pay or compensation for hours each week that I had worked over. Funny how Shelly made sure that I was told that I would NOT be considered for re-hire, since I gave 13 days notice not 14. When no discount was going to be given to me... I resigned, with 13 days notice... I was never ever given a new lease, paid my rent on time every month, the increase amount was sent to me in a text, nothing in writing. On June 10th 2017, I received an eviction notice on my door from Brandi Polvado, who was the Property Manager at that time. I hired an attorney. No one would call my attorney back, no one would explain why I was being evicted, without a lease. I was also current on my rent each month.  They were all such fools from day one. I moved out August 2, 2017, received a collection notice, a few weeks later...I never got a bill, never received my deposit. Thankfully...JRK has a reputation here as does TerraMar.  Small towns listen to what people are saying.  Thank goodness there is another apartment that is new in the area.  Beware...use caution...and take time to read what other people have taken the time to share.  JRK and TerraMar are very similar to a $3 bill.  PHONY!!!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Living in South Carolina at an apartment complex that is managed by JRK. It's been great! The place is clean, people are nice and my neighbros are cool. I think the rent is fair and I hear from other residents that broken stuff gets fixed quick. I haven't personally experienced a maintenance issue but that's what I hear.< /Review>

I’ve been ignored and given the run around for a month trying to get answers on my lease renewal upcharges. My unit is not modernized nor reflect the name “Luxury Apartment” and yet other units of the same floor plan  are listed at a lower rent rate which have been modernized. Turn over in staff happens often in the office, office phone numbers changed without notice, calls and emails go unanswered. And no one who is working seems to be able to help with anything other than taking checks or signing paperwork.

The laundry facilities are usually out of  order or mildly flooded and not cleaned. Pools are closed without notice of reason or tentative reopening. Waste disposal is always overflowing into parking spaces and the lot.

No one communicates timely, yet can find the time to put parking notices and extremely difficult to remove stickers on car windows that are parked on the street in unassigned areas...when you’ve only been parked long enough to unload groceries because your assigned spot is no where near your unit.

I have contacted the corporate office, including tenant relations now 3 times and have gotten nothing resolved or clearly answered.<//Text>

<text>***update*** I LIVE ON A PROPERTY IN CHARLOTTE NC AND IVE BEEN UPCHARGED RENT THROUGHOUT MY LEASE AND WAS NOT TOLD UNTIL I WENT IN TO ASK. ONCE AGAIN BO TRANSPARENCY FOR WHAT YOU ARE BEING CHARGED. seriously i wouldn’t move here if i had to do it over again. the rent is affordable on the front end but they definitely make up for it with a host of miscellaneous fees. every month there seems to be a new fee and what makes it even worse is there is 0 transparency. there’s no way to access details to see what you are missing. the way they handle mail is very disorganized and the staff is not helpful in anyway. i recently lost a package and the most the staff tried to do was look for it in the back. they also make sure to rotate their staff frequently to keep anyone from being held accountable. the gates are either broken completely or just left open. with all the new developments popping up around the university area i would not choose this one...< /text><user_name>Jerry Bacchus<//user_name><gmap_id>0x80c2bb676ae8a897:0xfc5d93b5ea1901a5<//gmap_id><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<review>Sorry, I don't like to do this but, since this company bought the property I rent at the place has been destroyed.
It's been a wonderful, family oriented, peaceful, green, happy place to live and within a few months, rent price raised to the sky and living conditions dropped to a fault.
The green is no longer green, dry land instead of lawn, maintenance issues above and beyond.
Just not what you want to write as a review anywhere.

We've been waiting patiently for things to get better for a long time. This is not looking good.
I would love to be able to go back and delete this review when things are taken care of.

You don't start improving a property by raising prices to what you later use an excuse whenever there are complaints; It's an old property we cannot fix it.
If you cannot fix it why can you raise the rent on it x 150%?

Reading below reviews I see the exact same attitude.
I experienced 100% what Dan Spohn wrote, what Brittany Hardy wrote, and more.
Don't even try talking to corporate office. They automatically transfer you to talk to a voicemail and if you call back the systematically hang up on you.
Wonder why their Facebook page doesn't have review option?< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1476057084573, 'text': 'Hi Sarah, please call our Residential Relations Line: (310) 696-7363'}< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c2bb676ae8a897:0xfc5d93b5ea1901a5< /Gmap_id></record>

If I could give zero stars to this company, I would!!! Had major issues with one of their properties ever since we moved in. Every time I brought an issue to the property’s attention it was excuse after excuse. Therefore, I decided to call their tenant relations line and the women on the other end was obnoxiously rude and gave me excuse after excuse as well and did not acknowledge anything I said. The. Proceeded to ask me “well, what do you want me to do about it?” Really!? This is your job!

My husband and I now specifically look to make sure the apartment complexes we rent at are not run by JRK. I will never rent with them again!< /text>

<Text>Hello from "The Charles" in Bellingham MA that was purchased last month by JRK Property Holdings.   The management team you put in charge of this property has ruined the community here and is the sole reason we are not renewing our lease.  Your company is awful at transitioning ownership and the one time we called your main number to try and not have to deal with the local management put in place,  the person on the phone was rude and did not respond to our emails as promised.  Your company is a joke.<//Text></record>

Perhaps the best customer service I've ever dealt with in a property company before. I've been renting at one of their properties for 1.5 years and have never had an issue. I've called a few times to handle some account stuff and everyone is always so courteous. Very impressed!< /Review>

Absolutely love my building here in Houston, Texas. Dealing with JRK Property Holdings has been a great experience and the few times I needed something, they would more than happy to oblige. I've been renting for a long time and this has been a very pleasant experience.<//Text>

A big thumbs up to the team at the Serenade at Riverpark property in Oxnard, CA.   They are extremely attentive and helpful and have quickly responded/resolved any inquiries I have brought up.  The complex and the grounds are always nicely kept and I have taken full advantage of the numerous of amenities they offer, including the pool which is like something straight out of a resort.  Safe and pleasant, Serenade has become my home and I have truly enjoyed my time here.<//review>

<review>We are currently living in one of their "million dollar renovated apartments" the montage! They are not NEW at all! I have pictures of just one of my NEW cabinets being supported with toilet paper and caulking!My first 2 months here the maint staff for the most pary do not speak English so our air conditioner went out we moved in here in August that was rough. They came 4 times Trying to fix the thermostat each time they said, oh jdt hold hold button down you ok. I'm not educated in heating and airbut i undestand howto use the thermostat even after the 1 and 2 time your showed me. Finally by the second month and 2 bills from smud totaling an$800 bill t he lady in the office alex says I'm so sry you have gone through this me get the supervisor out there. He comes that afternoon and says "oh ya let me replace that I'm sorry but we have to try and fix before we replace that's why we had to wait so long to swap your dryer too but i got you a new one today you shld be happy now." I really was hoping i would be but shortly after the air cond started leaking water i called them back they said they fixed it but the missing dry wall is still there
We didn't need to use the air after that theweather changed but i can tell you starting to use it again now its doing it again so I'm thinking maybei shld hire my own guy jst so i don't get a huge smud bill again. Any the next month here we get a notice to tow or truck for registration i tell them we haven't gotten the stickers yet but the registration is paid. They said ok we have it documented your fine don't worry. Well that Friday night 1:21am they tow our truck i go into find out whyas Alex says she is so sry they just switched tow  companiesand they must not have checked the notes come back Monday she still email ovi our manager and he will take care of reimbursing my $300 impound fees. I come Monday morning and Ovi screams at me that alex lied that she never emailed him anything about me and that he knew nothing about me. I said that's odd because i have been asking to meet with you since we moved in over how high our water bill is. Side note, thereis always a plumbing truck here and i have spoken with a few of the guys that have all said the same the plumbing here is just "all messed up". So needless you say ovi tells me that he has 2000 other happy tenants so he doesn't have to make me happy! I called his corporate office and spoke with carolina solano whom i have been speaking with and explained our situation and said basically i was wasting her time and to file a law suit if i was unhappy and when i asked for her superior she said she answered to the legal department and i can try and figure out who that is! I have since found other people that have had their cars illegally towed, one guy had good stickers mysteriously stolen and then towed. For the last 2 months every other day i have come home to a noticeto enter our apartment every time i emailed them saying they did not have permission to enter without us here. Last week they came in and woke my husband up that is a day sleeper which is why i said they couldn't come in by themselves! Could you imagine if my daughter would have been there home alone?! But i was shocked here they were again getting away with breaking the law and coming into my home without permission. We do not even know why they were entering just that that they came in. Scary!! Scary for other residents!! Everything in this place was not NEW and is breaking even the carpet was not new had stains in it! They had me do the walk thru after i signed the lease which i understandwhy now because i would have never signed it. I had 11 pagesof a walk thru of what they called a "new" apartment!! We have asked to break our lease but since we are at $1800 a month they won't let us out. I have yet to find anyone at this company to respond or care about their tenants except carolina solano who just wants you to "figure out" who her boss is. So do not rent any properties from these people, they may know money, but they do not know customer service; like my neighbors  t< /review></record></dataset><record>

It is amazing how many times I have called both the corporate office and the apartment complex and not one time have they called back.  The absolute worst experience I have ever had with a company, I hope you go bankrupt and lose everything.  I have called over 40 times to the local office and the corporate office, the fact that you replied for me to call you is comical.<//review>

<review>We reside at Breckenridge Point Richardson Texas. This is our third yearly lease agreement. The first year we were impressed. Clean property, maintenance was fast, pools regularly cleaned. This last year things have gone down hill. Pools are filthy, closed the majority of the time. The grounds are littered with dog poo and trash. The dog park is a minefield of poos. The pond has trash in it. Our rent increased again and fees for just about everything. As a past maintenance supervisor I strongly believe that the maintenance/groundskeepers are very short handed. This will be our last lease here.<//review><response>{'time': 1476057403410, 'text': 'Hi, please call our Residential Relations Line: (310) 696-7363'}<//response>< time>

< review>
Since JRK bought the Residences at Stevens Pond in Saugus, MA in the summer of 2014, the quality of the property and quality of life has dramatically diminished each year to the point where it has become unbearable and overly expensive to continue to reside here.
Some examples:
Longtime residents, who get hit with the exorbitant annual rent hikes, are never provided any regular preventative maintenance in their units nor is normal wear and tear of the residence ever addressed.
The grounds are filthy and disgusting. Taking a walk throughout the property, here are some of the things you will encounter on the grounds: trash/litter everywhere including spilling out of the compactors, dog feces, living/dead rats, cigarette butts, hypodermic needles, used condoms, dirty baby diapers, screws and nails on the road and in parking spots, empty beer cans/bottles, empty wine and nip bottles, broken glass, discarded clothing.  Residents keep prohibited dog breeds in their apartments, commercial vehicles take up all the parking spots, and decks/driveways are cluttered with unsightly furniture, boxes, etc. Residents freely smoke in their units even though it is prohibited. These conditions/issues are not addressed by management.
There is no landscaping. Lawns and shrubbery throughout the complex desperately need replacing. Curbs/sidewalks, outdoor lighting are broken/cracked and never fixed/replaced.
The snow removal has been deplorable. Even after the "clean up" during which your newly shoveled car gets plowed back in until they come back to dig it out hours/day later, parking and getting around the property is always very difficult. Property managers/staff don't last long, but most of them have been ineffective anyway. While they were here most of them did little to nothing to alleviate concerns. In fact, they were usually quite rude. Apparently JRK does not provide customer service training. Sarcasm, nastiness and turning the issues/blame back on the residents are standard practice. Calling corporate is just as useless. The tenant line is always "full" and voice messages, emails never returned. The "IKEA" makeover of the offices, clubhouse and pool that took way longer than scheduled was completely unwarranted. A good cleaning, sprucing up would have been adequate.  Besides the new amenities are not properly maintained and the gym, game room, clubhouse bathrooms, pool area are dirty and disgusting to the point where they are sometimes unusable. At night the basketball court/gym is taken over by who even knows (I hear they are not even residents). Security is much needed here but is nonexistent.
To sum up, the website is false advertising and this is a horrible, horrible place to live!< /review>

<Time>1527595637742<//Time><Rating>1<//Rating><review>I moved into one of your properties and was immensely disappointed, disgusted and dissatisfied. I was moved into a filthy apartment that smelled like pets and fecies. I can literally see the black hair throughout the carpet. My screens I'm the window are ripped and torn. The patio deck is splattered with paint and mold. The Windows sill had built up bugs and dirt and I find nothing luxurious about this place at all. In fact is an old dump and needs MAJOR renovations. I don't want anyone making the awful mistake of choosing this place as a home Its overpriced and poorly maintained and managed. Had management taken the time to resolve my concerns I wouldn't be writing this review. Also if you cared for your tenants your would consider checking the messages on your residential hotline, its been full for 2 weeks. I'm certain fulfilling this lease will be the worst year of my life!</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1527634073977, 'text': 'Please call our direct corporate line at (310) 268-8344'}<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c2bb676ae8a897:0xfc5d93b5ea1901a5< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It's all about service and I feel like that gets lost a lot of the time. Happy to say that the staff and management at The Heathman know the meaning of service and deliver just that.
I called beforehand with just a few questions and the concierge was so helpful. I mentioned it was my birthday trip and she sounded genuinely happy I chose this hotel for the occasion.

We arrived and it was an experience from the beginning. A WOW factor for me from the valet, the concierge service and a complimentary drink, they payed attention to detail and had a note about my birthday and gave us an upgrade. I felt so special. Everything from checkin to checkout, was better than I imagined. Being personable and friendly goes a long way. I highly recommend this hotel.< /Text>

If i could give arewn vista a negative star i would. Not because the trash is piled high and rarely ever in decent condition, not because there is never any parking but because of the staff but in particular the property manager. She is the worst person i have had to encounter in my life. She lives above my apartment and has been the worst neighbor i have ever had. First incident her son was bouncing a basketball at 6 in the morning waking me and my roommates up early. We went to say something about it and a gentleman that was visiting her was kind enough to apologize and assured us it wouldn't continue. After this we have went to her apartment on 4 other occasions because of the excessive stomping. We have attempted to knock against the ceiling so she would understand that they were stomping loud and instead she mimicked us and started stomping even harder. When i went to her door she slammed it in my face and said get away from my door. The time before that her response was what do you want me to do about it. So here i am 11:30 at night writing this because i am up waiting for the police to arrive to speak with her because she is being belligerent. I do plan to take this above her. JRK Property the people you staff at your properties disgust me as a paying resident. I will not be renewing here. I will be sure to tell all my friends that stay here to not renew here.</text>

<text>The Sheraton Grand in Downtown Nashville is a great hotel to stay at for business. Conveniently located within walking distance of top tourist spots, the Sheraton Grand Downtown totally takes care of your conference and business needs. All staff are not only Nashville friendly, but actually helpful. Our room was cold and the engineer Randy actually fixed the problem -- totally recalibrated the thermometer. I do wish there lights so one could actually read in bed at night, but that's a Sheraton design problem not management. They have a wonderful and friendly bar called The Library, with tons of books that you could borrow. A great hotel that I will be staying at on my next trip to Nashville.< /text><Rating>5< /Rating>< Resp>

They never fix anything and their property managers are punk little kids who treat their customers as if their the Gestapo in Nazi Germany. Avoid any property they own. Also, good luck calling their Client Relations line. What a joke! They never answer, they never call you back.

I neglected to write a review because I wanted to put this place in my rear view. Yet after not receiving my deposit since July of 2016 and just recently receiving a call from collections about an amount owed that was never mentioned in the numerous times I've called to receive my deposit, I feel obligated. This apartment complex is run a by a huge rental company JRK. They have no personal incentive to keep you happy or correct issues that arise. Many neighbors are loud. Domestic abuse and loud neighbors are quite common here. Talk to the Murrieta Police Department and ask about their reputation. All of this might be forgivable if they had a low price point but they don't, they list themselves as a luxury community. The whole complex has issues with ants as well. Please save yourself the headache. Also if you have suffered through a similar process I encourage you to leave a BBB review for JRK and file a complaint.

I neglected to write a review because I wanted to put this place in my rear view. Yet after not receiving my deposit since July of 2016 and just recently receiving a call from collections about an amount owed that was never mentioned in the numerous times I've called to receive my deposit, I feel obligated.

Through out the time that I have spent representing this company I have never had a negative experience. I have to portray this company in a positive light when showing people new properties, and I never feel like I am deceiving the potential clients in any way.

When it comes to collecting money things can always become complicated. People trying to negotiate a lower rate after their expenses have already been established, or trying to hide form paying each month.< /review>

They then raise my rent by 100 dollars. (Even though the front desk was telling me I am already paying way more than everyone else)

And also they have a 2 month lease break instead of the typical 1 month. It's a buyer beware situation with a big company like this.

No exceptions, no budging. I feel sad I have to leave because I really enjoy the property, but I will not be stuck with that heavy hitting of a contract while also jacking up my rent.

<Review>Greetings! I use to reside at the Bexley House Apartment Homes located in Columbus, Ohio for almost 5 years. Conveniently close to downtown, the Port Columbus Airport, and the bus line. The floor plans were beautiful, spacious closets, really high ceilings, washer and dryers, and a fireplace! So cute and quaint. Some of my fondest memories were when I was living at Bexley.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
JRK Property Holdings seems to be okay with its properties being run without any respect to the law or human decency. They owe me $533 and I have legitimate security concerns with regards to one of their property managers, and their response is to ignore the issue and send my calls to a voicemail box. Below is my full story-

We were tenants at Shadow Ridge at Southlands in Aurora, CO from June of 2016 to June of 2018. We paid rent and utilities in full and on time every month, and left the apartment in cleaner and nicer condition than we received it. We have receipt of surrendering the premise on 28 May 2018. We received neither our security deposit nor an itemized bill within 60 days of surrender, nor within 60 days of the end of the lease. This is a violation of Colorado Revised Statute 38-12-103 (2). We mailed our certified  7 day demand letter and served proper notice of our small claims case to the property management at Shadow Ridge. After failing to appear in court, a default judgement was entered against their property Shadow Ridge. We are now owed $533 for the illegal retention of our security deposit. I also have concerns about their property manager Tamara Huber. Despite multiple contacts (and proof of contact) with her about this issue, she denied any knowledge of it and became  verbally abusive to her staff and myself. Her behavior was absolutely reprehensible and unprofessional- I am shocked no one called the police on her for screaming the way she did in her back office. I have exchanged contact information with another tenant who witnessed Ms. Huber's meltdown for corroboration. Regardless of any issues I may have with her for illegally keeping our deposit, no employee (no human being for that matter) should be treated the way she was treating others today (screaming in her back office at employees for ~30 minutes). I feel very unsafe knowing that such a seemingly unstable person has access to our information and forwarding address.

To see sort of treatment and customer service that JRK Property Holdings is condoneing and finds acceptable, search "Shadow Ridge" on Youtube.</Review>

< Review>
I worked for them for about 5 months and I can honestly say that they are,  in my experience and opinion,  the worst company imaginable for which to work.   My perception was that they don't care AT ALL about their employees,  or residents!  I could not find  another job fast enough.   I've been in the workforce for over 40 years,  and I've worked for a variety of companies and held jobs for about 7 years on average.   JRK is at the bottom of my list of companies that I think someone should work for.   I never experienced micromanagement like I did at JRK.  I got the impression that they don't trust any of there employees.  My manager actually said to me,  very early on in my employment,  "the company we work for has trust issues.".   That is actually a gross understatement in my humble opinion.   I would never recommend that anyone work for this company,  or live in there properties.  I saw nothing that told me this company has any ability to respect it's employees or residents.   I felt complicit in what I felt was the unfair treatment of residents while I worked for this company.  I could not,  in good conscious,  continue to remain in their employ.  It seemed as though all that mattered was to squeeze as much profit as possible without any non financial criteria ever considered.  It's difficult to state these opinions strongly enough.   I wish I could give negative stars.<//Review>

<review>TRIED CALLING 10 MORE TIMES AND NOTHING!! DO NOT RENT AT RESIDENCES AT TEWKSBURY COMMONS ESPECIALLY WITH KIDS!!!
I have left numerous voicemails at corporate and nothing! We left due to safety reasons with drugs!  Many drug issues ( including a huge drug bust and some one rolling some kind of drug by my kids at the community playground last Thursday, in which they did not seem to care much about),  lost our $400 package until my husband dug through all the mail and found it even though they said no one signed for it and we have receipt that they did,  borrowed our pots and pans for a pipe burst emergency in the apartment next door ( which they handled horribly and the manager at the time disappeared for weeks and made my friend pay rent even though she could not live in her apartment since it was flooded) and never returned them until my husband went next store and got them himself and they were all moldy,  gym equipment is almost all broken,  did not have facility ready for a party I scheduled to have in the clubhouse,  there is trash and dog poop everywhere (which is awful since I have Muscular Dystrophy and use a wheelchair full time), there is never anyone in the office (No one was sure for a while who was running the complex), no community activities,  the tennis court is all broken up and my daughter fell and cut her elbow up on a chunk of broken pieces, our freezer almost stops working every month,  someone had parked in our paid spot on several occasions, the pool is opening less time this summer than usual, and the whole atmosphere is now unsafe feeling.  I am sure I have more,  but I cannot type forever.  WE BROKE OUR LEASE AND THEY WANT US TO PAY! I THINK NOT!! Still no call or answer even though they told us to call immediately. Funny how that works!<//review>< rate>

<gmap_id>0x80c2bb676ae8a897:0xfc5d93b5ea1901a5</gmap_id><Review>JRK Property Holdings has changed everything about our apartment for the worse. They changed our rent due date when my husband and I have been living there for 3 years and have never been late on rent, they charged us a late fee for the days falling differently and my husband and I not being able to pay without paying a huge credit card fee online. I am so utterly disappointed in the way things have gone since this property management team took over. We have been living with mold and instead of them changing our windows (that are 37 years old), they are deciding to not do anything about it and just patch up the problem. I am not one to write reviews about anything and normally I just let things slide, but I cannot hold my tongue any longer. I hope that JRK goes out of business at some point because of the way they do business and because of the people that they hire. I am fed up and done and I cannot wait to move out of this place that I am sure they will charge us astronomical amounts just to move out of .

Thanks for nothing JRK!<//Review>< Time>

<text>Absolutely horrible property management company, and apartment complex.  I haven't had trash picked up since July 1, and I'm paying for this 'service'.  I've called and left 3 msgs. w/dept. of tenant relations since yesterday, no one returns calls.  I've spoken with property mgr. here in W.Chester about this and other issues - "we're working on it."  Actually, no you're apparently not.  Multiple lease violators, fire safety issues, pit bulls, collapsed hole in parking lot, just goes on and on.  We're moving after 3 years - when JRK took over this winter (2016) the whole place went to hell.</text>< gmapID>

It is bitter sweet though as I have been promoted and have to move to California. I highly recommend Centreport Lake Luxury Apartments, great community, helpful staff, and close to the highways and attractions. You will be missed! :(</Text>

Having lived at JRK’s Citigate, in Orlando, Fl, for a couple of years now, I could not be happier with the time that I have spent here. The grounds are always very well maintained, and it has always been an absolute pleasure whenever we have encountered any of the staff. My husband and I love that they are accommodating to our dog. Honestly this place is amazing, it feels like they have thought of everything, even pre-wiring the walls with surround sound wires, which my husband insisted that I put in the review.</review>

One of the absolute worst property management companies i have ever experienced hands down. After being a resident of a property for 5 years JRK bought our property. In the last 2 years they have changed managers and leasing agents every 6 months and have had a total of 5 new maintenance crews in the property. They have destroyed what was a class A property and continue to hire unqualified managers who have zero regard for the residents or the property. I have never experienced such open thievery when it comes to the charges and bills they create and there is absolutely no customer service onsite or in the corporate offices. No one will even return phone calls or is willing to assist the residents in any way. If you want to be ripped off and have your property rundown then find a JRK acquisition.</review>

When you call this company to file a complaint against a property that was rented by us, they say to leave a voice mail but their their mail boxes are full.

They leasing agents lied to us and leased a property that was supposed to be away fromy the street noise. Was totally inaccurate since we did not get a chance to see the property as we lived 200 miles away. Now they want $ 700 transfer fee to move us to a quiet place, have not even lived there 8 days.

On top of that the dryer has posed a fire Hazzard. They tried to fix it once and made it worse. Now it smokes. And there is still more things wrong on the list that have not been attended at all.

Stay away from these con artists. Hope somebody will return our calls after they read this review and settle with us.<//Text>

< review>
I moved to Hideaways at Greenbrier in February of 2016 which is managed by JRK. Upon my move in I had read many negative reviews on-line from previous residents. Instead of taking heed to the reviews I went ahead a signed a 12-month lease. Huge mistake! From February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October and November was a living hell! My neighbors above me were beyond obnoxious. There were three male roommates who lifted and dropped weights all throughout  the day and night. Not only were they lifting and dropping weights. They would occasionally run sprints across the floor. I politely asked several times to quiet down but no avail. I also told the rental office which assured me that they would take care of it and they  didn't.  I had to wait until there lease ended and Hideaways allowed the three of them to move to another building. In addition to the noise, my a/c did not work for several months. Maintenance was called out to my place well over 12 times and I have the work orders to prove it. I was told the a/c unit was frozen. I was told my a/c unit had a leak. I was told not to run my a/c in the heart of summer because it was leaking into the unit below me. Again, maintenance comes back out says it's fixed. I'm running my a/c on 69 and my house still wasn't cool after being on for several days. I contact the front office again and I was told by maintenance staff "to just give it some time your place will cool". Well I gave it some time alright. My electric bill was 300.00 for one  month. I battled trying to staying cool the entire summer but it was an epic fail! I just ended up with a high electric bill for June, July and August. Well you would think the issues would end there. Not exactly. Between July and August I started noticing huge water bugs in my garage of my place. I notified the rental office and they placed me on the pest control list. Pest control only comes out one time a week on Wednesdays. Well pest control came out and the huge water bugs eventually made their way into my home. The water bugs were in my kitchen, in my bedroom, my bathroom and in my bed. We are now in the month of January and the problem is not corrected. I have been bitten by a water bug, showed management pictures of  the water bugs and nothing. I asked Lacey who works in the rental office could something be deducted off of my 1537.00 rent or could I be moved to another unit. She forwarded my concern to a Laura who was the property manager at that time. Laura advised her I could move to another unit but they would NOT cover my moving expenses. I advised the staff that I had been miserable as hell since moving in and they should be responsible for moving all of my heavy furniture and having my televisions re-hung since this issue was a Hideaway issue. Well Laura no longer works for JRK. She has been replaced by Amanda Powell. Well Amanda Powell has been absolutely no help at all. She told me my water bug situation was not considered an "infestation problem." I explained to her that I paid out of my own pocket for Terminix to come out and they sprayed and stated otherwise. It was an infestation problem.  Amanda pretty much told me to just keep paying my rent and she wouldn't even allow me to get out of my lease early and I asked in November could I get out of my lease due to a breech of contract because it states your home would be pest free. I have lived in many different apartments and this by far has been the worst! Please take all reviews into consideration before signing your lease at this property. Do not get sold on the first month rent free or  half off deal. It's not worth it. It has been a living nightmare and this has done nothing but inconvenienced me. The water bugs are so bad I had to go stay with my parents. Staff members change every other week and all they want is your money regardless of how bad your living conditions are in your apartment. Do not move here! I only gave them 1 star because it wouldn't allow me to post. They deserve no stars!</review>

I reside at Arwen Vista apartments and this has to be the worst experience I have ever had. I cannot wait until my lease is up. There is constant domestic violence and marijuana smoking below my apartment. The management team is do ineffective in handling issues and it is quite ridiculous. I am seriously considering breaking my lease so that I can live at a more peaceful property.< /Text>

I live in the Runaway Bay Apartments in Columbus OH and the management there is AWFUL. Iv had a leakage on my ceiling for almost 3 WEEKS! We've gone down to the office to tell them and they kept saying they are coming to fix it and never did. I finally got fed up and talked to the manager telling her how upset I was and how I shouldn't have to pay the full rent amount when I couldn't even shower in my own apartment (ceiling leakage was above my shower) the manager did absolutely nothing. She told me she was not giving me any type of discount and was raising her voice at me the entire time. She even threatened to kick me out of "her property" and told me to leave her office. I was so shocked at how unprofessional she was. Iv been trying to contact the corporate office and no one has called me back. Never in my life have I been treated with such disrespect.<//text>

We live in the JRK Westcliff Apartments in Westminster, CO.  Needless to say the management of this facility is an absolute joke.  They fact that JRK doesn't do anything about the reviews and complaints shows what kind of company this is.

Look at the yelp reviews and google reviews of this place. It is an absolute joke.< /text>

I was a resident of their apartment buildings at Centreport Lake Apartments, Fort Worth, TX during my job assignment in the area for approximately 17/18 months. It all seemed well as it looks kept up. Let me just say, that's simply window dressing. The staff on site is less than professional. They look the part, and even talk it when you are face to face. However, on numerous occasions we would call to have our bathtub drain unplugged (yeah, there was was down the drain). Maintenance wouldn't show up for the remainder of that day or the next. We would have to physically walk to the office to request this because they don't write anything down. We have a dog, and as such we are very much on top of our responsibilities to clean up after him. We walk around with baggies all the time just in case. However, we were in the minority. There is dog poop all over the common grounds. We complained about this as well, and only flyers went went out reminding pet owners to clean up after themselves. The poop situation did not get any better in the entire time we lived there. Another constant is that the security gates will be broken. They tout a gated community for your safety, however at least one of the gates was open at all times at least once every other week. They don't get fixed immediately either. It's nothing to find the gates open for 4-5 days at a time before they're working for about a week before being broken again. These, in our minds, were minor inconveniences. After all, we were only there for a short time before returning home.
The big kicker though, is after you move out, and the reason that I'm writing a review. We asked for a walk-thru the day prior to moving out. They didn't show up. Being that we were driving from Texas to Michigan, we left the next day well before the offices opened. During this last week we were in constant contact with the office. Paid our break-lease fees, rent, overages for our utilities so we wouldn't have to worry about it. Fast forward one month.... a call from a collection agency. Keep in mind, we have heard nothing from Centreport Lake Apartments or JRK Asset Management. Apparently, they don't grant you a courtesy of letting you know you owe them money. We owe them above $600, but less than $700. For what? They had to replace the carpet, the same carpet that we noted was in bad shape when we moved in. However, they claim the dog peed on it all over even though either my wife or I was home with the dog 24/7. I can assure you it wasn't from our dog. Regardless, the carpet needed replacing anyway and they conveniently could not find our initial checklist noting the damage to the carpet prior to moving in. We did not hang pictures or damage walls, there was nothing to suggest that we damaged it. What this complex will do, is wait until you move out and if your apartment needs some renovations, you are footing the bill.
I would caution anyone to rent from such shady businesses. Unfortunately I am seeing this first-hand now. You may be lucky and rent an apartment that needs no work and get out with minimal charges. I just wanted to be a cautionary tale for anybody else out there who might think they look like nice apartments, there's a whole slew of underlying problems with this place. They received 1 star from me (Hated It), mostly because I could not give them 0 stars!</Review>< pics>

I have decided to rent an apartment with JRK (Eagles Point, Tampa ) ,I paid 200 admin fee and 65 application fee total of $267.00
There has been lot of gun shoots in the apartment and I do not feel secure to rent this apartment anymore.
I have not even signed the lease and I decided to drop off.
Still they are not refunding the money back.
Is this how you make money ? to run your business ?
WORST MANAGEMENT EVER
They do not have phone manners.
The management is very terrible that even if I cancel the application .
They are not refunding the money.
The management is very annoying and not friendly at all.
Worst experience ever.< /text>

<review>I live in the Courtyards at Buckley in Aurora Colorado and it has been the worst experience of my life.

Please everyone look at the Google reviews from tenants that have had to put up with these crooks!

It's not even issues with other tenants, its JRK Management that is the issue!

This is a nice little shopping center.  The only bad store that needs to be replaced is Safeway.  Management doesn't seem to know how to keep the register lines from forming.  The Cashiers are nice but Management needs to be replaced.<//Text>

The entire staff was friendly and knowledgeable. I wanted to especially give thanks to Ish and Ricky for helping me out. They have all the latest equipment to mount and balance your tires. This is the only shop in the East Bay that I know of which has a road force balance machine. If you are not familiar with road force balancing, please google it. Thanks again, I will be coming back.< /Text>< GmapID>

<Text>Rolled up an hour before closing on a Saturday afternoon with a popped tire. Got me in and out at a fair price in 15 minutes. Like a pit crew.
Wish I’d had time for a full set but I was running late. Looking forward to buying the rest of the set next week. No wonder they’ve got so many stellar reviews.
Great job, guys!<//Text>< GmapID>

Went in to replace a OEM Yokohama tire. New tire already ordered but when inspected my old deflating tire was still in good condition and only had a small nail puncture. They recommended for that to be patched instead. Patching went very quick, only cost me a few dollars & new tire returned without any fuss. Top service from a small garage! Will definitely come back when in need. A+++!<//Text>

Life Storage has been the best storage experience I've ever had! I've had quite a handful of storage units over the years and Life Storage has been, the easiest and cleanest experience. It's great that the monthly rates are so affordable!

All the staff I've contacted have always been polite and helpful as well. All around, Life Storage has been fantastic.

10/10 would definitely recommend.</Text>

Ms. Ayala, the Store Maher, was quick and efficient in getting me into the right size space and at a great promotional price.  The facility is very clean and temperature controlled with many carts to assist with getting your items into your unit fast.  I would highly recommend storing your belongings here.</review>< gmapID>

Every time I needed to stop in, the grounds and buildings were clean and kept up. The automatic lighting worked perfectly and I never had a problem with the climate control. Though it went through a few ownership changes over the years, I’ve found that the most recent ownership group has some of the most friendly people in the office.

< Review>
Loved everything about this place. Being a young, single female my mom hated the thought of me having a storage unit outside, in the dark (I get off work late) and going there by myself. She rented me a unit and I always felt so safe going late in the evening while I was moving. You need a really long code to get in the gate which they don't really lock til 11pm, the premises is video surveillanced, well lit, well maintained and as far as storage units? Is so this one again for sure. They also sell excellent packages of moving boxes and provide great service. 5 stars!</Review>

Great initial experience. JP (Jaime) at the front desk was extremely helpful and went above and beyond to help me get everything I needed to secure my storage unit. The building is very clean and the units are, most importantly, affordable.</text>

I needed a storage unit while I was moving houses and Angelica was exceptionally helpful through the process of keeping the unit reserved while I waited for escrow.

The former manager, John, and the current manager, Patricia, keep the facilities very clean and are able to provide quality service over the phone or when I walk in (and I walk in a lot).

The security there is excellent, the exteriors well lit with complete coverage of the driveway, and the buildings climate control makes this location incredible. Nothing like the typical storage places.

I would absolutely recommend this location and it's staff to everyone I know, especially if you enjoy solid concrete walls and a controlled indoor environment instead of the typical humid, musty plywood partition storage facilities.< /text>

<user>100116065148623257338<//user><pictures>None< /pictures><review>I looked at one other newer storage facility in the midtown area of Sacramento, and this place was hands down above and beyond.  The person that helped us, Patricia, was so helpful, and made sure to let us know how to get a $25 discount by reserving the unit online, even though we were there in person.  The grounds are so clean, and the unit was impeccably clean as well.  All units are behind the drive through gate, which I love, and each unit has its own individual gate code, which also unlocks the security system for your individual unit!  Unlike the other place I looked at, the box where you enter your code can be accessed without leaving your car, allowing you to just pull right up and enter the code and drive through.  There are multiple entrances to the inside areas, making it convenient to park closer to your unit if its not near the first door.  Plenty of carts right inside the door as well.  They also are converting all of their units to cylinder locks, which means your unit is extra secure.  Haven't put anything in my unit yet, but I am extremely satisfied with my experience, highly recommend!</review>< rate>

I am looking to relocate to California.
I talked to Patricia Smith and she was so helpful!
I called other storage places in Sacramento area and I couldn’t get anyone to answer my questions.
Your storage facility will definitely get my business. Thank you Patricia for all your help!!!< /Review>

Great Friendly, polite customer service.  Jonathan was very thorough and accommodating.  Wanted to make sure I was happy with my unit, he really took the time to make sure my lock worked, and my gate accessibility functioned. I am very happy and comfortable that I chose Life Storage to meet my storage needs.<//text>

<rating>5</rating><text>I like LifeStorage of Sac.  They have long hours (I can access from 6 am to 8 pm seven days a week).  There security is great, they have something like a hand truck (but better, it's one of those big flat carts you see at Sam's Club when you need 16 cases of soda ;) ) always available for loading and unloading.  It's comfortable and climate controlled.  Overall I would definitely recommend, they do a great job!  Oh, they also have a free truck you can barrow for moving larger hauls.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

< Review>
This company took over my old company Superior Self storage the El Camino location. Everything went bad. First they started to require insurance on the unit. They were trying to sell me their insurance on a 5x10 it came to $130 per year through them. I have apt renters insurance for about the same and my goods are covered through that. Their insurance has a 5,000 coverage  limit for that $130. Next they shot up my rent by 33% they want $99.00 for a 5x10(new customers) Superior Charged me $50.00 for an outside unit. I am not happy. Suggest people not horde but downsize and keep only the good and important stuff. Our great grandparents never needed storage facilities. Just say NO! to self storage.<//Review>

Buyers beware. They offer great discounts to reel you in and then spring lots of hidden costs. In my case i booked a 5x10 unit for $47/month for 1st three months. The lady (amber) at the call center told me there was "small" $10 admin fee added which included the price of lock.
So I drive from Grass Valley hiring a U haul truck on which i pay .89 cents/mile. Load everything into it and arrive at their facility at around 1 PM. I am told that I have to pay a $20 insurance and i cannot opt out of it further the admin fee is now $25 and not $10.
At this point of time i cannot take the U haul back as the that costs me $100 for the day with mileage. So I have no other option but to cough up 47+20+25=$92.
As a consolation the manager tells me there many other people complaining about the call center and we are not the first people like that.
The only good part of this experience was the manager came and gave me hand with lifting a chest of drawers.</review>

Life Storage was a life saver! I had to move twice in three months, and it was so great to have nearby, easily accessible storage as I went from place to place. It was always clean, well kept and I felt safe there day or night. The staff was always helpful, online bill pay super convenient, and the free moving carts handle better than my Dodge Calliber. Highly reccomened!<//Text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>My girls just finished their semester at SacState and we were needing a place to put all of their stuff for the summer. Our first thought was Public Storage. So we went to the closest one with all of my daughters belongings but to find out they were completely full. Stuck, my daughter called a self storage unit number and directed us to LifeStorage which was only 800 yards from a Public Storage. We immediately drove there and to find out, they were very spacious and very clean. The manager Stephanie took care of all our needs and gave us a storage right away. No hassles and quick. Not only was self storage better then public storage in cleanliness and security, but they had carts and dollies to easier assist us in our move.
If your looking for a storage unit, look up Life-storage before you go to a Public storage and you'll see a big difference, well at least near Sacramento state!!!</review>< pics>

<review>This is an excellent storage facility, although pricey. Most of the units are climate controlled (i.e., air conditioning and heating for the whole building, not individually controlled), and therefore not prone to dust build-up or damage from temperature extremes. The staff is friendly, and they offer free use of their truck to move-in (or move-out if you didn't use it on move-in). They also provide flat-bed dollies to help move your stuff in and out of the units. Elevators make upper-floor access very easy. Each unit is individually alarmed, and they have good camera coverage over the whole site. My only complaint is that the whole time I was there (about 10 years), they increased the rental rate every few years. Sure, the rates in the whole area went up, too, but just be aware that the rate you start out at will probably go up in a year or two. Otherwise, it was a great place to store our stuff.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Rate>5< /Rate><gmapID>0x809adac302af3a89:0x2c69fccf9970592f<//gmapID><user_name>Will Murray (Willscrlt)< /user_name>< response>

Love their cupcakes and get them for my clients all the time. Friendly service but the wait can be long sometimes, but you can't blame them for providing food lots of people want. Worth the wait.<//review>

<review>Their sanwiches are amazing the turkey avocado is my favorite! Their bread is fresh and wonderful. Their cookies are yummy. They have all kinds of fresh baked goods. They have macaroons that are a must try. They have day old bread that is a great deal and still so fresh!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Name>Ana</Name><resp>None< /resp><user_id>116924114817823620052< /user_id>< rating>

I was so excited that a bakery was opening up close to my house. Went in the other day needing to order cupcakes. The employee told me they do not customize anything. All I wanted was simple cupcakes with a specific design and they insisted they make nothing custom. I can get cake and pastries at the grocery store. Why bring a bakery to the area when you can't customize a simple cupcake...</review>

Got a racist vibe from this place, saw advertisement on website about macarons so decided to try them out. Was greeted by a mean waiter who stated they were out of macarons and wouldn't have them again. Very cold place.</text>

Every time I call to either make my payment or inquire about account information, I’m always responded with a quick and professional response. For example, I called yesterday to ask about some payoff amounts for my policy and Lupita was not only extremely helpful but also very quick when providing me figures. I’ve been a customer with Joven’s Insurance for about 10 years and I absolutely appreciate them for all they do!<//review>

Went in today to receive a quote for my car and was greeted by Laura. She was so friendly and welcoming! Not did she only make the experience pleasurable but her and Mario were able to get the lowest rate for me with great coverage's! I also loved that Laura told me about all the services they offer and entered me into a 1000 raffle!! love Joven Insurance!!< /Text>

This place is AMAZING! I needed insurance and went there 1st...got a quote that tied with another place I went...I was like I'm getting the same deal elsewhere. THEN he done what all businesses should do- he won me over! He took $20 off my down payment and kept me under $50 a month. Plus took there time to explain what the difference is and answered all my 'girlish' question. Love this place!< /review>

Mario does my taxes, I get back money every year and his filing fees are low. He is very trustworthy and experienced in tax preparation. I recommend him to all my family and friends.</Review>

<review>Thank you Joven Insurance! I have my auto insurance there for 3 years now and everyone is so nice and helpful. I had to get papers notarized and was able to get it done there when I couldn't find a Notary anywhere on a Saturday. Thank you Debbie!</review>< pics>

Good quick service for ordering inside; unfortunately, I can not say the same about driver delivery service, I notice the staff and the driver were totally disconnected, no hand sanitizer for the customers, public restroom still closed and not inside eating allowed yet.<//Review>

I celebrated my graduation today in this gorgeous place. Well we passed a phenomenal evening and the place was absolutely the reason for that outstanding celebration. The crew  cooperated in a very nice style, the meals were extremely good and my friends were extremely  happy. We shall absolutely come back again for more events. Thank you very much.< /review>

<Text>I really wish I could give this place less then one star not only did they get my order wrong the first time. But when I finally got home with my order I realized the the egg in the breakfast sandwiches I had order was molding!

Be careful this place might give you food poisoning<//Text>< Date>

Service is sometimes kinda slow here, even with those new screens. At times, it's Awesome... The same goes for the food, sometimes dry. I guess it depends on the team working those hours.</Text>

I love McDonalds and I always catch myself getting cravings for it, but it seems like every single time I go to this certain. McDonalds location, they always mess up my order in some way. Whether it being no sauce with my chicken nuggets (even though I specifically ask for BBQ Saucs), or giving me the wrong size fries, wrong size drink, or just whole items missing from my order, its always something with this location to where I have to start checking inside my bag before I drive off and almost every time I still have to tell them "oh I didn't get any BBQ sauce"</text>

They have great staff specially the guy taking orders i didn't got his name .but he has great customer service skills. Thay makes the waiting worth it. The drive thru waiting is normal 5min-15 min keeping in mind its a busy MC Downloads restaurant.< /review>

<text>The service is to slow the employees must be retrained. The man's restrooms smell like sewer and the restaurant had the door open its horrible for the tables near the restrooms or for anyone who needs to use the restroom.  Then you have a bunch of homeless all around we had one who came to our table asking for money.
They need to have a more healthy environment for the customers if customers don't complaint than the ones who run this establishment will keep ignoring the comments and will keep running this place like their keep their homes.<//text>< pictures>

<text>Came to this mcdonalds because its my local one. Received my  order incorrect and they didnt even give me a receipt to go back and exchange it. Even when i went back the line was so long and couldn't even get my order fixed. Very disappointed with this mcdonalds and wouldn't recommend coming here as they do not have friendly customer service staff.<//text>< user_name>

They workers always sound so rude, don’t repeat the order at the next window, don’t give me my receipt and leave the window. I had to go to the next window to ask for it and even then they didn’t greet me< /Review>

<review>Who's idea was it to fry up a potato, GENIUS idea. If I do say so myself.  I believe there is a lot of competition out there as to who makes the best 🍟 fries.  McDonald's is a leading competitor along with their dipping sauce.  Thank you!!!<//review>< Pics>

The food is very good and fast but also bad. some of the fries felt soggy and like there were left out for up to an hour or more also there were long lines on the drive-thru almost all the time but I can't deny that the most of the food there is delicious< /text>

<review>Slowest McD... In the world!

Be prepared to wait 20 minutes plus no matter the time of day. If you are getting breakfast in the morning on a weekend... Forget it. Might as well go to the Denny's across the street, you'll eat and be out before you would get your order here.<//review>< pictures>

Fries are burned and stale, soda fountain are not put on right. I got Sprite, and it tasted just like syrup. They did not mix it right. Cleaning ladies are way to loud and keep dropping the signs. I live nearby, but I will not be coming to this one ever again. Thanks but no thanks.< /Review>

<Text>Omg.... I cant believe the service here at this Mc Donnells real bad service and the resturant is filty...the dinning area...the worker is too bust with his ear plugs talking on his phone than paying attention to detail . Like the tables need to be cleaned after ckearing it. There were condiments spillage all over and not wioed dwn. I took pictures and i have reported this resturant to the health dept.< /Text><name>Victor Lopez<//name>< user>

Drive thru there is horrible. I spend 40 mins in drive thru to not even get my food because as I was waiting in the drive thru like for 30 min I call the place and manager said sorry that they were trying to get thru the drive thru at quick as possible but no 10 mins later I just put my car in reverse and the 4 cars behind me also reversed out. Dont waste your time going here better driving to another driver thru.... p.s. managers name is Luis Chavez and I feel really bad but posting this but theres no way in hell I'm ever going back to this place horrible horrible service....< /Review>

You can't go wrong with McDonald's no matter where you go their coffee is out of this world as long as you get a fresh pot I've noticed later on in the afternoon the coffee's not as fresh as it could be that's when I come home and I make fresh coffee but McDonald's coffee is great< /Review>

It was alright. They did well in order, with the exception of putting onions on when I requested none. Other than that it was good. 😉!</Review>

Im not joking here, I saw a prep cook, while preparing food, poke his nose, while prepping food.  Super slow service, incomplete orders, poor management, no motivation by staff. They should just shut down. Why when you go to In and Out burger, the staff is always at attention, and any poor community McDs, everybody including management have this "hating there job" kinda look.  We the customer can complain all we want, but nothing changes at this McDonalds, nothing.<//Review>

Every time I come to this McDonald’s they never have anything! They should really be more specific with the times they want to serve stuff. For example they never have their ice cream machine on and they stop serving mc cafe menu items after 8 pm. Hmm thought it was 24 hour drive thru disappointed<//review>

Slow drive thru everytime I've been here, so decided to go inside instead but to my disappointment found the restaurant to be very dirty.< /Review>

<text>This McDonalds has recently finished renovating.   The interior has greatly improved, and looks much cleaner and modern.

The food is your standard McDonald's, with variances based on who's cooking.  They will often meet your special requests, but it's hit or miss sometimes.   They've gotten small things wrong (ie: mayonnaise on a no mayonnaise order).  The manager, Oscar, will do whatever is needed to fix it and have you leave happy.

The WiFi is bad, so don't expect to stream movies or TV shows while connected inside. The bathroom could use work as well.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2cec3afd11c51:0x71516d3ea68c41d1<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Date>1498059247627< /Date><Rate>1<//Rate><review>(Translated by Google) I come from La Puente and come to Bell City for an errand, in the end I go to breakfast, Mcdonald's on the corner that is fine for breakfast but disappointment or fatal service. It took me more than 20 min to give me my breakfast and then the person who cleaned an old lady, with the complaint, that the drivers what this other, on the side of the windows inside was super dirty .. rare in a McDonald's .. ahsss I said I come to breakfast and relax in the end .. My husband went to the bathroom and for bad luck someone had taken a shower and someone had also dirty the toilet at last, the lady again complained that because she washed the men's bathroom ahhh I said ufff need to find out the annoyance that he does not like his job in the end, then I finish finally cleaning the bathroom, my husband entered there was not. no soap, no paper .... Ahhh what a bad service .. Managers more attention with their employees, employees if they do not like their work let someone who wants to work do it and not be filled with stress just because they are not happy. In their employment and do not let us customers find out about the gossip. Apart from unpleasant is lack of ethics ... The truth is that McDonald's is a shame disaster that is beautiful

Tardaron para darme mi desayuno mas de 20 min y luego la persona que limpiaba una señora mayor , con la quejadera,  de que los manegadores esto que lo otro, de lado de las ventanas por dentro estaba super sucio ..raro en un Mcdonald's .. ahsss dije vengo a desayunar y relajarme en fin.. Mi esposo paso al baño y para mala suerte alguien se habia echado un Shower y alguien tambien habia ensuciado el escusado en fin , la señora nuevamente se quejo que porque lavaba ella el Baño de los hombres ahhh dije ufff q necesidad de enterarse de la molestia de que no le agrada su trabajo en fin, despues termino por fin de limpiar el baño,  entro mi esposo no habia. ni jabon , ni papel.... Ahhh que mal servicio.. Managers mas atencion con sus empleados, empleados si no les gusta su trabajo dejen que alguien que quiera trabajar lo haga y no se llenen de stress solo porque no son felices. En su empleo y no  dejen q nosotros los clientes nos enteremos del chisme.aparte de desagradable es falta de etica... La verdad este Mcdonald's es un desastre lastima que esta bonito</review>< Pics>
