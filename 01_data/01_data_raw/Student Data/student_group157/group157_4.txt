<Review>Place was great. Kelli the girl who helped me was so sweet and really knows her job. I would recommend this place to anyone who needs to rent a car but make sure to bring your insurance policy if you are renting with a debt card.</Review><Time>1613436491864<//Time>< gmap_id>

OUTSTANDING!
The other popular places had all these 2 day maximum,  one way only, policies and restrictions, didn't have the larger sized trucks that they advertised.
5 minutes at Enterprise rent a truck and we were out the door saving $600+
0 restrictions.
Couldn't have asked for anything better!
I will never go anywhere else.</review>

<Text>There is this assistant manager Kelli Schneider, she is rude, every question I asked she looked confused... not willing to help me at all to make a customer happy! She didn’t have a intermid size vehicle available, instead on upgrading me to a full size sedan she decided to made me wait 53 min! Terrible service! She needs training, she needs to be more caring.
Completely disappointed I waited 53 min to get sent home with a tiny corrolla! I have a beautiful suv luxury and spacious! I was treated pretty ugly. No customer caring 0 care.<//Text><date>1606179602032</date>< gmapID>

<text>I needed to rent a car for a day because my car was in the shop. I have used Enterprise in the past, with great results. Enterprise makes the process so easy. I called, made a reservation, and the next day I had a car. All I needed was a compact, but to my surprise I was given a very nice mid-size at the same price. The checkout process was fast, and the woman that helped me was very pleasant. I returned the car on the same day. The return process was incredibly simple, and a different woman assisted me. Again, she was very pleasant. I needed a ride home. Within a few minutes I had someone available to take me home. I had a long, and difficult day. Enterprise made my day so much better, with their timeliness, and excellent customer service. I chose the Enterprise on Monument in Concord, because it was close to my house. I've used many different Enterprise locations, and each one has provided excellent service. I would highly recommend the Enterprise on Monument in Concord.</text><userid>111195644025352415678< /userid><rating>5<//rating><Response>{'time': 1580769771012, 'text': "We appreciate your positive review about your recent experience with us!

Walked in and immediately got a great car.  They were helpful and attentive...even showed me how to use some features on the car that I was unfamiliar with.   Better service than what I got from  Hertz down the street who didn't even have a car for me even though I had reserved it the day before!<//Review>

Enterprise took care of me from the beginning.  They were incredibly accommodating and the prices were reasonable.  I had to swap out cars and there was no hassle at all.  In addition, they went out of their way to find me a car with a CD player so I could finish my book.  Cannot say enough.  Thank you, Enterprise.< /review>

<text>The morning after I totaled my car, my insurance company Geico paid for a rental for me at enterprise. It was such a smooth process and that is really important after a traumatic event.

I visited Concord Monument branch of Enterprise. It was my behind the wheel then. It was really wonderful given my very first experience with the enterprise rental service. I had a chance to meet two of your really helpful and amazing employees one of them was Amro Alalusi and his fellow colleague whose name unfortunately I don't remember. But above all I am really pleased that both of them understood my situation and offered me with a great deal of service. I would love to recommend enterprise to everyone who needs such service.< /Review>

<Review>The customer service at this location has always been excellent - fast, friendly people, consistently clean vehicles, a clean & well-organized workplace...basically,  a quantum leap above their competitor just down the street. Easy vehicle collection, fast and easy returns...exactly what a rental operation should be, time and again. If there's a caveat, and in my case this has occurred four times in a row, my reservation for a sedan has been "upgraded" to an SUV...which I neither want nor need. So, a great deal of good - but a bump in the road, regardless.<//Review>< pics>

<review>We always rent from this Enterprise location because the staff are very professional, helpful and customer friendly. I needed to change my rental period when I realized we needed to leave a day earlier and Rawny made sure I had the vehicle we needed. I also had to change the pick-up time and that, too,  was handled without any problem.  Their rates are also better than other Enterprise locations near our home.  And the vehicles we get are always good and clean.<//review>< Response>

<Text>I was sent to this Enterprise for my rental coverage through Jim's Auto Body and Geico. My $50/day free coverage went a long way here, but I was leery about getting set up with something too big for my assigned garage spot or not to my taste. Thankfully, Amro was working the front desk that day and went out of his way to make sure I walked away happy. He pulled some strings to set me up with the new Camaro! Pick-up and drop-off was a cinch. Everyone was courteous.

So all-in-all, I highly recommend this Enterprise, especially if Amro is there to help you out. I hear they even have Teslas here, which I may rent another time just for a fun weekend drive...< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Picking up and dropping off my car was SUPER easy. Car I received was extremely dirty on the outside, but clean enough on the inside considering it was a rental. I have been in nicer rentals from enterprise, so this one must have just come back from another customer?</text>

< Review>
Been using Enterprise for my rentals for a while..Made a reservation for an 8:30a pick up for a Full size SUV, took about an hour after I was told that they were giving it a quick wash. Wasn't busy as it just opened, but when the SUV was shown to me there was dried water marks and dust on it. Not filthy but wasn't what I was told..I've only had problems with the timing it takes for pick ups of rentals even with planned ahead reservations at this location even a few months ago when I was with my in-laws. Didn't think it should've took this long..put me an hour behind schedule with my family that day unfortunately< /Review>

Usually when I return after so long on yelp is to have a bad experience with any business but today was different because today receives the best care and service for a representative enterprise rent a car his name is Doug T and this gentleman works Enterprise Commercial Truck in 2550 Monument Blvd, Concord CA 94520.

The 01/12/15 I make an reservation for a commercial cargo van in another branch of enterprise in 1790 Concord Avenue Concord CA, but for some reason the reservation could not be completed at all because the van was asking was for commercial use . rent a commercial vehicle on time can be very crucial to determine that generate or lose money and was also what he understood the account specialist for commercial truck division Doug T, he offered to bring the van to my home and I did not have as going to collect the van because I have my REPAIRS currently go for chevrolet dealer. I think that an employee makes the difference between a good and bad company but definitely Doug T is the reflection of a very good and competent company.

I am more than satisfied with the service provided and that is why I put it in this way and if the branch 2550 Monument Blvd offers more options and discounts.

Thanks Dough T< /text>

<Review>The staff has always been friendly and helpful. The cars I've rented in the past have all been cleaned thoroughly before renting. I've never had any trouble extending my reservation if I decided to keep the car for an extra day either. I just rented a car for a trip to Las Vegas during Thanksgiving and I'm picking up another one in a few hours..... see you soon 😉</Review></record></dataset><record>

Reserved a car for a week (7 days) with Enterprise through Costco Travel.  When you use Costco Travel you get the Costco discount ~plus an upgrade (must be Standard size and smaller, also a plus 1 extra driver is free.)  I ended up extending  the rental for another week and was given the same weekly rate. That was nice that they did not increase the price as some do.

I reserved /ordered a Standard size vehicle. When I picked it up they gave me a intermediate class car 1 catagory down or down size 1 class.-
I did not know this until i got home.
i did not get the  Costco bonus upgrade on.this rental.  I think they had limited stock on hand since it was  New Years eve and they had reservations on most cars.

This Enterprise location is on Monument Blvd in Concord CA, . The office/location is not fancy. It  has a large waiting area with  carpet and some chairs along the wall.

I went in around 8:30 or 9am. There was 2 employees working  and I was the only customer there at that time.  I had  no wait..  Everything was pretty basic I thought.   I had did the reservation online on Costco's website. I use my own insurance and do not purchase any of thier extras. I asked about bringing my husband in to show & record his  drivers license info since he will be the  2nd driver. I was told I did not need to do that since he is my spouse.
This time they did ask for my personal insurance info/policy # etc to record. They had not asked for proof of insurance  before.

As a standard practice, We walked around the car looking for any damage on vehicle, making  a note of anything found.
I was in and out quickly probably took 15-20 minutes.
I have rented there before and everything went smooth with a real nice upgrade the other time & no problems.

I coinsider it unprofessional  for them not to of communicated & informed me  that there was a change  in my reservation.  My cost was lower due to that  change.
If you have a Costco membership (or family member does) and plan to be renting a car be sure to check  the Costco website for thier discounted car rental prices-  Those Prices were much lower then  on the Enterprise website directy.  Usually they offer better deals then AAA is offering.
You can choose a  Enterprise car (or another rental Company)  with the Costco discounted  prices.
AAA offers deals on Hertz cars at lower prices then most.</Text>

after a series of mediocre rental experiences here, my latest one has convinced me to go over to Hertz (oof). enterprise made me wait 20 minutes while they cleaned the car to give to me, even though I told them when I'd arrive and they insisted it would be ready. when I returned it today, 4 employees ignored a very long line, leaving me to wait again. the lady who watched me wait 20 minutes yesterday claimed she had no idea why I'd had to wait since the car was cleaned and ready for me (yet she watched it happen 18 hours before?). there's no trash can available for cleaning the car out upon return either. the whole place is clearly geared to the commercial truck rentals, and cars are an afterthought. they're a few blocks from my house, but it's just not worth getting treated like this anymore.</Text>

First let me begin with the fact I signed up for a reservation but still ended up waiting an hr for the car which had not been delivered yet. I was promised there would be 15% taken off all final charges for my discomforts. We rented the smallest version car to save gas and saved up for the gas program because we were told its cheaper. To make a long story short we lost the keys and ended up getting the car towed overnight to avoid being charged an extra day. Drove about 2 gallons. The next day i get on the phone with Danielle who tells me im being charged 339 in full for everything. I said how can that be? She told me they charged about 230 for the tow truck plus the charges for the day. i said how could i be charged $100 dollars for a days rental when i was told it was 29.99 plus gas. She said they charged $40 for gas which i claimed was an outrage being we only drove 2 gallons and it was a Nissan Sentra which came half full. How could we even have possibly used that much gas? She agreed and told me there would be a $40 dollar gas credit attached to my next rental. The other charges were her fault because according to her she did not get the car into the system before 3 pm. She promised she would get it handled before they close and return my call and email me a receipt. I never received that call and figured everything was taken care of. Until today that is when i checked my bank account and see ive been charged $330 for the car. I called the office to dispute and was told by the manager Danielle would return my call as she was currently with a customer. 1 hr later i got sick of waiting and call and Danielle picks up. I told her i called an hr ago and was waiting for her to call back about the reciept she promised me on the 16th which she never returned my call. She said she did and nobody answered. So she left a voice mail. Ofcourse i never got a call that night so there is no voice mail. Just like she never called back today. So Danielle tells me on her end it says they charged 253 and theres nothing she can do about it. I told her on my end my bank account says i was charged 330 and what can i do about this. She tells me she can call my bank and she them receipts and i asked her what would that do? She said she was trying to resolve the situation. I asked her why she never called me back that night and she started talking over me all ghetto and claiming i was talking over her? I thought the customer was always right? So i should just shut up and listen to you talk? Wow Danielle. So then she says i can take it up with her corporate manager but before i could get the number she hangs up like a child. I called back a few times and she literally picked up the phone then hung it back up. This is a professional establishment by the way. Or i thought it was at least. So now Danielle hates me and wont rent me a car so im never even going to get my 40 dollar gas credit. or have my charges disputed. Im actually online google the corporate managers number as we speak. This is appalling I cant believe they would treat a customer like this.< /Text>< Date>

Went in to get my 60,000 mileage done on my car and brake fluid and transmission fluid was leaking out of my car and stained my mom's new pavers.</Review>

poor service and quality

Font office clerck with an attitude, no written estimate was given, mechanics with NO gloves and oily hands and uniform, He hit my car door to the post, simple oil change, changing oil , oil all over the engine, scratch the engine cover to open and replace oil filter. Overall very poor service. The clerck made sure No repeat business going back there with his redundent questions and rude and bad service. Costing me 2 times more to replace the scratched Engine cover and polish the driver door.< /text>

{'time': 1506784615472, 'text': "Arthur, I know it's been a while since your review, but we wanted to assure you that we would never intentionally falsely advertise a certain price. We have multiple coupons go out at the same time. Each usually has its own terms and conditions, so it's sometimes easy to confuse them without seeing the physical coupon in person. We apologize for the miscommunication, and hope you'll give us another chance. -Barry H, General Manager"}< /response>
<pics>None< /pics><date>1356720612252< /date><review>I recieved a coupon in the mail for discounted service, so i called Perfect Auto to make an appointment and they said just come on in. I then mentioned the coupon and they asked what kind of vehicle required the service. I told them it was a Ford Ranger and they said it would be fine. When I got there with the coupon they told me the cost would be higher. The price went from 169 to 300. When i told them that they were false advertiseing i was offered less service for 200 dollars. These guys are liars in my opinion. They advertise one thing and sell you another. I would highly recomend going somwhere more reputable.<//review><user_name>Arthur Cox< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

I loved this store the minute I walked in. It's much bigger than I realized and I loved how everything was organized, clean and clearly labeled with the benefits of different crystals and stones. The owner was super friendly and helpful. The whole vibe in store felt good. I'll definitely be back again.</Review>

I want to tell you about possibly an Establishment of worldly and personal experience not in every place where their types of raw materials are sold.

Both the Owners are Extremely well versed in their amazing wellness items and you will be doing yourself a grand gesture favor to stop by and get aquatinted with this Sacred Spot. I highly recommend if your into this miracle spot to find peace of mind and more, pls stop by,

you deserve so the Best and again that's what their not promoting but Sharing with this makeshift world as their trying to bring you what you need: good vibrations and another 20 years of life, love, energy and positive healings...

Amazing! I cannot say enough good things about the lovely people who run this shop. Kind, compassionate, and energetically intuitive. I highly recommend making an appointment for a biofeedback scan. As soon as you walk into this shop, you'll instantly feel a warm welcoming feeling of healing love. They carry all of the stones, elixirs, healing teas that you need to accompany you on you or path of wellness.<//Review>

< Review>
The store was very lovely and had a lot of great stones and good info posted for you to easily read. However, when checking out the male owner noticed the stones I picked out and asked if he could ask me something personal, I said sure, I love an opportunity to learn! But he never actually asked me anything, except for "do you understand" multiple times after many different subjects. I did learn a lot about him, but then the conversation spun out of control and somehow got on the topic of menses and breast issues...??? (Not much of a conversation I was listening and nodding). And seriously this isn't even a tiny portion of what he talked about, it went from why my generation is so depressed, to women eating icecream, to a little physiology review. I was unable to leave because I had already paid and he was wrapping up and bagging my stones. He did give me a lovely gift of a stone he thought I would benefit from and I really appreciate it! And I can appreciate the attempt to help with his own experiences,  however the derailment of the conversation made me uncomfortable and I likely won't be going back for a while because of it.</Review>

<pics>None<//pics><text>Owned and operated by two of the most beautiful souls I have ever met. Everytime I come in I leave feeling so amazing and enlightened.. I experienced first hand a week ago the forensic understanding they have of energy and healing when I sat through my first energy balancing. I am a horrible insomniac and have been completely dependent on sleeping medications most to no avail with the exception of one. After my balancing for the first time in 15 years I slept on my own with no medication!! That is a miracle.. they were able to pin point health issues they had no way of being able to know before hand guiding me that's a harmonious existence and much increased comfort. I highly recommend the water filters as well. No third phase water will make you feel that good. . All around a happy place with happy people! Thank you guys!!!< /text>< Rate>

SOUND HEALING REVIEW
I’ve been waiting for a long time to start my sound healing journey and I was blessed with the opportunity on my birthday at the beginning of this week. It was a good time to start for me, as soon as the process started I felt heated points through my body and head, wherever I usually got aches and pains that’s where the hot spots on my body were. Then a few hours later i began to realize that my thoughts were going 100 miles per hour and I knew then I needed to focus on my mental state and all the aches in my body because if not taken care of now then they’ll only get worse. As the days went on I’ve been more sensitive and aware of MYSELF around others, what I say to others how I treat others, what vibes I’m giving out to people. I will still discover more as the process goes on and I encourage others to start. I feel lighter and I feel my body wanting me to make changes.< /text>

So the owner of this shop caused a ruckus at the Marysville peach festival recently. A police officer arrived to help and he immediately became excited and did his best to lure the cop into a confrontation. When that didn't work he took to Facebook in an attempt to find sympathy. This didn't work. People started commenting and he became belligerent. Stating many times that people didn't get it because they were white; furthermore he seemed intent on making clear that whites in general were somehow criminal. His shop has been a blight to all the other businesses on D street, and has had numerous complaints. By his own words he is an admitted racist, and not a fan of law enforcement at all. His shop consists of cheap crystals and incense and is a complete waste of space. I would strongly urge everyone to avoid it completely.</Text>

This shop is an incredibly serene place to just be.  There are many, beautiful gem-mineral specimens to see as well as touch and hold- yes TOUCH AND HOLD!  The owners are two of the kindest, most-gracious people you could ever meet and they both encourage you to handle the crystals and specimens so you can actually feel them, not just physically, but also to be able to really feel the individual specimen's energy.  I fell in love with the yenergy of this blessed place almost immediately.</Review>

<Review>If you’re looking for a resource to amplify your all around wellness NATURALLY look no further. The owners are always informative and courteous and answer all of my questions with kindness. TEAS, crystals, essential oils, sounds healing? What more can we ask for here In Marysvile? They also host community classes which are AMAZING and I have been privileged enough to attend a few! These few words cannot express the amount of joy I feel when I walk into this shop!!!!!!

I never knew that there was a local gem shop! This shop is bigger than most other ones I've found in the surrounding areas. The owners are super friendly and informative. I bought a cute quartz fairy cave and was told it came from Morocco. I've never had anyone be able to tell me where their items originally came from! Huge selection of tumbled stones, quartz clusters, raw gems, jewelry, tea and much more. What I loved the most is that the owners weren't even near me most of the time I was browsing- that might sound like a bad thing to some people but I've had experiences where the owners like to hover like you're trying to steal something. Overall a great experience and I'll be back for sure!<//text>

<Text>3 reasons why I will be taking my business to Ology in old sacramento.
1. There have been 3 separate occasions that I have stopped by your store during normal stated business hours and you have been closed.
2. There is a card on your store door with a phone number that doesn't even work. Your listed phone number has been disconnected.
3. I messaged you through Facebook to find out what your actual business hours are since the ones posted in the store window are inaccurate and could see that you clearly read my message but didn't care to respond to it.
I was planning on spending a decent amount of money in your store but will be taking my business somewhere else. GOOD LUCK!< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<text>So friendly and professional, and gave me a nice discount for having things organized in my garage and easy for them to get to. Lot's of communication beforehand about when they would arrive. Seemed a little pricey but the discount was much appreciated! Overall worth the money, I just got half my garage back.< /text><GmapID>0x808f7f01205d5949:0x929dcfdddbf153bc</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I have used Junk King on multiple occasions and am always impressed with the professionalism displayed by the dispatch team and the drivers, in addition to the value you get.  The hauling bins are a great deal and an easy way to get rid of that clutter around the house.  No need to break your back when you can haul to your driveway and have them pick up.  I was fortunate enough to have a bin delivery driver named Mark who made the experience better with his communication skills, timeliness, and knowledge of permissible materials for dumping in the bin.  If you are dumping materials be cognizant of allowable trash to avoid penalty fees.  Junk King is a service I would recommend and will use again.< /review>< GmapID>

Junk King experience was excellent. The team was professional; communicated arrival time, and was prompt. They were efficient with time in the removal of the furniture without leaving any mess behind. I rarely give reviews but I was so happy with their service that I want to give the highest recommendation. I would  definitely use them again< /Text>

Cesar and Juan called early and asked if they could swing-by earlier than our appointment time, which we agreed to.  They were prompt, professional, and courteous.  They effortlessly moved 2 bookcases, a heavy sofa bed , TV trays, ottomans, and bed frame with expertise within minutes.  I would highly recommend Junk Kings, and especially Cesar and Juan.  So pleased with the service and reasonable price.</review>

The crew was great! Luis, Juan, and Juan worked efficiently to remove my items from my second floor apartment… With no elevator! They went above and beyond, and were professional. I can’t wait to use them again.</review>

Easy to order Junk King Mini online. On time, professional help. Easy to fill it up. Cost effective. What more do you want when getting rid of household junk!?< /Review>

<Text>The team was professional, respectful, and fast. We had many items that filled an entire truck that the team made easily disappear. They even swept up the driveway at the end.< /Text>< userid>

The two guys who came to my place were fantastic! They were Covid-19 safe and quickly & efficiently removed a lot of items from my apartment. I heard a few large crashes of things while they were working but ultimately it’s junk so I didn’t mind. And my apartment was in perfect condition when they left so it all worked out. I would absolutely use them again if I could (I’m moving to Long Beach this month) but would highly recommend them to anyone who needs stuff taken away. Moving is exhausting in so many ways and having them come take this one extra step off my plate was an absolute gift. Worth every penny.</Text>

<review>I forgot the staff’s name but they were extremely efficient while being safe. They took care of a a ton of couches, and general junk. Our place of business is much roomier thanks to the people at Junk King. I would highly recommend them if you are in the South San Francisco area. Use them two times already and they get the job done< /review>< pics>

<Review>The first crew were prompt and courteous  when they came out for the estimate. I will say the estimate was a bit high.  The owner was  willing to negotiate a fair price.  The two gentlemen that came out for the job were friendly and professional and cleaned up the area afterwards. I will for sure use them again if need be.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><userid>114502954619136870043<//userid></record>

Not only did they show up on time, they actually showed up early and got everything done beautifully. Great team work! Friendly staff and big truck! Please leave your drive way open for them because I totally forgot! My bad..i would totally hire them again.

UPDATE: Since there was one item that they didn't remove from last week's visit. They said they had to get to the next job. They gave me a discounted quote ($110) and scheduled another pick up for today. SO, here is the reason why I downgraded them from 5 Stars to 1 Star. They arrived today and told me the charge is higher, at $90/hr plus the original quote of $110, for removing a failing 6'x 8' shed. The person who gave me the quote was also convienctly not here today. I should have insisted that they remove it last time. No cool at all.<//Review>

<text>Extremely nice people, and everyone wore a mask/mouth cover. Initially we were scared because a group of people came (like 5-7 people). We learned that they were training people from other states. Everyone were super nice and efficient. And be advised, women can do junk removals as well!!! It's nice seeing other women doing jobs that are considered "men only".

Also why does everyone get lost coming to our apartment complex lol.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

Such a great business! I was able to make a pick up appointment right away. On the day of the pick up, I received a text confirming my pick up window  and a call when they were on the way. They were on the dot with the time. They moved quickly, were open to say if I had anything else to throw out since I didn’t reach my cap. I will definitely use this service again!< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>We had an awesome experience! They were very responsive when scheduling the estimate. The day of the removal, they provided the estimate upon viewing all the items and did the junk removal so quickly! We had several large items to get rid of and they gave us the best price when compared to two other companies! I know who to contact the next time I need to do another junk removal. Thanks Junk King!< /review>< resp>

<review>They texted me a day before to remind me, and they called me an hour before to give me a heads up. Then they called again at 10 mins away so I had time to prepare any last minute items. And they arrived on time, the earliest part of the 2 hour window. They were done in about 20 mins with my couch, bed frame, 2 bikes and some random junk from the garage. Great work!</review>< pics>

This was my fourth time using Junk King. They’ve always showed up within the scheduled window of time. The gentleman quoting the price was personable and polite. They cleaned up in a timely manner and hauled away our “junk”! Who doesn’t feel good after that?!<//Text>

Starting with first call, everyone so helpful & willing to answer the few questions I had about the service. Learned about them from truck in neighbors driveway. Got set up with appt during first call. Everyone so nice & pleasant even with reminder notices! The men that came over to haul were very nice and did an excellent job. I knew it was alot, they dove into it the job was no longer than a hour. It was alot! No complaints just gratitude & compliments to them. I will need a second round and feel confident about hiring the Junk Kings again! Highly recommended & Thanks again!!</text>

Great value for the amount of time and space that you get to rent their dumpster. Customer service was very good and dropoff and pickup were seamless. My one criticism is that their scheduling/payment system has issues and my initial dropoff date was missed and I had to go back and forth with their CS multiple times. However, they compensated me for the trouble.< /Text>

<Text>This place is fantastic. The service is top tier, and our server Alex was a great soul. My fiancé and I had a wonderful meal and even better conversation, it's so nice to be able to come to a unique venue with an amazing history and even better food/service. 4 would highly recommend< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>Not really 100% on this one since I was already pretty buzzed when I went in but I wasn't 86'd and I am certain I had a few cold ones while I was there.  I only remember tid bits of this night so I will have to be more lucid in order to honestly inform everyone of my beer drinking expeditions.  The big question is;  Would I go here again?  I would but I am reserving my 5th star until then.<//text>< gmap_id>

< Review>
About 4 months ago. I came in while visiting. Unfortunately , before coming into this establishment, we have acquire bad service at 2 other bars. I just saw that the owner had responded. I would like to correct my review. That review was for another bar, which I updated. I'm not sure how my review ended up on this page. I had actually gave it 5 stars.
This bar was the only bar that treated us right. The bar tender was excellent and very friendly. I actually came back into this bar a few times after that for work trips. I'm am very sorry about the mix up.  To the owner and it's employees. I send my apologies. I love coming here, when I am in town .</Review>

Myself and a few friends have been going to Blvd Cocktails on a weekly basis since the change of ownership from Off Limits. There is a total change of atmosphere from before. The staff is friendly and outgoing. There are TV's everywhere, two pool tables and darts too. The bartenders are excellent and drink prices are reasonable, with many types beer on tap. If you want to cut loose and have a good time, there's always a good vibe here.</text>

I will say, I kinda find this surprising because Long Islands are strong by nature.

Justine is just so awesome of a bartender! Super down to earth, always willing to listen. She works normally Tuesdays and Thursdays. Darts, good beer, and pool are a necessity when going out and this place provides, hands down. At times when I'm in the area, this is the place I'll be back to time and time again!< /Text>

<text>Great bartenders and service is always spot on. I been there several times but tonight it was an awful and uncomfortable experience. Bartenders were awesome but there was a DJ there playing music way too loud with way too much treble where you couldn’t even hold an conversation with the person next to you. I usually stay for several drinks but tonight we were out of there after 1 drink. Thirty minutes  later our friends ( who also go there a lot) told us they walked in noticed how uncomfortable the volume of the music was turned around and left.< /text>< response>

Bar was great, drinks were great, prices were great, bartender lastnight wasnt so great someone in my group didnt tip as much as the bartender expected for pouring 2 beers and she started talking smack, being extremely rude to everyone in the group, pointing out the guy who didnt tip enough to im guessing was her boyfriend who was sitting at the bar to the point where there seem to be alot of tension and ppl started leaving. Very unprofessional. The bartender should be the one to deesculate situations and not causing them especially since everyone in the group was tipping independently and she got more than enough tips from everyone else. Most likely not going back it killed the vibe to wat was a good night< /text>

Golfed for the first time at San Francisco Country Club this week. We were greeted so warmly by Ed in the Pro Shop and our two Caddies Brian & Aaron. Met Krista who made us feel like family instantly. Thank you to Ashley & Patrick as well. Incredible staff, incredible golf course, incredible experience! Thank you!</Text>

<text>Enjoying Easter Sunday this morning at St. Thomas Moore Church. Feeling great after mass just to find out they towed 12 vehicles parked along a fence that does not restrict entry to their facilities. I understand theres a "no parking" sign. I'm not desputing that I was technically illegally parked. However, the so called manager enjoyed watching us come out of church to our missing vehicles. Again, parked alongside a fence that does not restrict entry to the club.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Awesome layout not too difficult to walk. Amazing condition, very exclusive. Some freeway noise on the finishing holes. Looking forward to coming back in the near future .<//text>

<Text>This private golf club (open to members and their guests only) is home to one of California's finest golf courses. At times relatively open, at other times more tree-lined, stylish bunkering lines the fairways and often surrounds the not overly large, but lightning fast greens. Devoid of water hazards, there are plenty of other golfing challenges that ensure this Tillinghast design gives every part of your game a thorough workout.</Text>< pictures>

A great test of golf.  I have played here my entire life.  There is new way to mess up a perfectly good round of golf every time out.  Great team in the clubhouse in case you need a lesson or two.  This is a family friendly facility with really great food and service.  Not a better country club experience in the Valley.< /Text>

Their food was as good as their customer service. I cannot remember the last time a place jumped to make sure our party was satisfied and taken care of like they did. The Pita bread is imported directly from Israel. Come check them out. Great people, great food, I will be going back.<//text>

Great service, authentic home cooked Mediterranean cuisine.
I love this place, the falafel is great, the pickled cauliflower is really good too. I don't have one negative thing to say about this restaurant.< /text>

They give big portions and have a unique blend  of salads, including some native sauerkraut. These are more like salads that have some degree of spicyness, but its okay because your not gonna get this quality of food anywhere in san Diego except 2Brothers. Try the Chicken Thigh Skewer because it is the most juiciest and tender chick on a stick you will ever have. This is quality food and you will be happy. The staff is warm and welcoming and will not disappoint your expectations.<//review>< user>

Ok so, I'm starving and my usual spot was packed. So I drive down the road and seen this place before and never thought twice about. I took a gamble and won! The food is amazing! Pitta bread was soft and full of flavor. The Hummus was creamy with actual flavor, service was great Ofer and Amir were very fast and friendly can go on about the Rest but you will have to try it!< /Text>

Just like the Schwarma in Jerusalem! Friendly place with great, authentic Isreaeli food. I've become a regular. It's not fast food; everything is made to order...fresh, homemade ingredients.</Review>

<Text>Oh so so delicious. You wouldn't expect it from how it looks from the outside, but this unassuming place has DELICIOUS middle Eastern food- hummus is some of the most authentic I've had in the US. Falafel is great, kebab was wonderful, and you have to try the spicy harisa to put with the hummus. Mmmmmmm.... Great service, Ofer is a sweetheart. Clean, delicious, great experience, I have absolutely nothing bad to say.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Food took long, especially since we were two of four people. The hummus had toops much tahin, there was no salad - their idea of a salad is off. And the meat was rubbery...< /Review>

I just recently switched from sprint to AT&T and my swap over couldn’t of been anymore pain free. Daniel one of the customer service representatives was a top notch help. I couldn’t be happier with not only the customer service he provided but walking me through each step along the way to getting me the plan and the phone I wanted. I will be recommending everyone I know to AT&T. Please stop in and ask for Daniel if you guys are thinking about switching phone carriers. Thanks again bud!<//Text>

Thanks to Fritz Bautista for his excellent customer service towards me. I switched to AT&T from T-Mobile and saved quite a few bucks monthly wise and in the long run. Fritz Bautista made everything super simple and super efficient. He is very knowledgeable about his promotions and products so that in return I can save the most money and get the most bang for my hard earned money. Plus the service was far more superior than T-Mobile I noticed. Once again, thank you. Everyone needs to see Fritz Bautista for any wireless and/or home entertainment needs. I wish everyone got treated the way he treated me as a customer. Love my new iPhone 11 Pro Max!<//Text>

Ordered new phone att online but my sim card was too big for my new device. Walked in immediately I was greeted by the manager, told him about my sim card issue, he got the gadget, quickly sized it and installed in matter of minute while we chatted..very friendly and welcoming. Didn't realize this location was there..definitely a place to come to with your att needs.Thank you!<//Review>

Went into AT&T looking to upgrade two of my lines. Upon walking into the store it was busy with only one associate there, Nadine. She greeted me as I walked in, and let me know she would be with me soon as possible, and apologized for the wait. Her customer service proved to be excellent, and she did not buckle under the pressure. I definitely recommend Nadine. She was a honest, hard working young lady, and she found the best plan for me. Thanks Nadine!< /text>

<review>This store is amazing! I had came into today to get a New phone because my phone was broken and I got immediate service. I didn't even get both feet in the door and someone was already assisting me. The staff was great and the manger was super helpful. Definitely would recommend this store!<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>Wonderful experience! Was welcomed immidiately and attended in a timely manner. Best service in Corona. The Manager at the store, Jesus, gave me the best deal available for my wireless services and also gave me a fantastic deal on my home services, entertainment bundle. I’m now paying lower than what I currently was and have brand new devices. Will recommend anyone to this awsome location.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dd29ee99139d5d:0x7c109f63efe5477d</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I used to work here a few years back and was told they no longer need my assistance the day after I pointed out a very large amount of fraud to the manager which happen to be the Owner's brother. Apparently they were skimming iPhone's and Black Berry's off of their own inventory and selling them overseas for large amounts of money. I've never been more frustrated. I guess I was better off not working for a company that has owner's with those types of morals.<//text>

When I came here, there was only one person working. Waited an hr just to get an upgrade on my phone. Should've gone to a bigger store where service would've been much faster.

They also have dummy phones on display so you are not able to test which kind of phone toy would want. That didn't matter to me since I already knew which phone I wanted, but it would matter to a new customer who does not know which phone to buy.</Text>

takes a bit long to get service. I was mad and yelled at the gentlemen for taking so long but realized it’s becaus they are helping people instead of dismissing their problems to customer service. I would definitely do my future business here. I was educated on my plan and advised on how I can save money. Because of the patience and time Daniel took to help me I saved $38 a month. I sent my sister over and she also was helped by a gentleman named Ray. I think he’s middle eastern. My sister said he was very polite and helpful too. He helped with phones and also got her a tv and internet bundle lower than what she was paying. This store is by far the best store I’ve ever been too. It does take a while but the service is great. I applaud the manager for teaching the employees how to treat customers.</text>

I stopped in just to "check on something" and I walked out with a new phone and an iPad mini- and I didn't have to pay anything extra on top of the cost of the phone upgrade. Nadine was the first to help me and she was so knowledgeable and helped me to understand what I could do with my plan and what I couldn't. The manager David also helped to reassure me that my account wouldn't change and all would be ok. They are a great team and I'm so happy I came into this location.</Review>

<text>One of the best experiences I have had at an ATT store by far.  I was able to get the best deal at the time. I got 3 new devices and my bill was still able to lowered. Look for Lance, Store Manager, he was able to get me a deal that no other ATT store can match.</text>< pictures>

Thanks you guys for all your help. Really took time to sit down with me to give me a thorough breakdown of my service. I understood everything and took advantage of a wonderful BOGO deal and Directv and Highspeed internet package. Thank you, Jesus, for the awesome deal and for always helping me with my questions and concerns. Highly appreciated and thanks for keeping my monthly price for my services at a low monthly cost. Recommend anyone to visit for a wonderful customer service experience.</review>

<review>Best Staff in the AREA hands down! Huge shoutout to the mangment here. I Went to the AT&T store on Mckinle St, and waited 2 hours because they did not have enough workers to help 3 people. Went to this store and was helped instantly. Rafael was fantastic and very helpful. Although I was already having a rough day, his customer service was on point and much appreciated, because I walked out of that store satisfied. Thanks staff and management !< /review>< gmapID>

This store used to be awesome..USED TO
For the past 3-4 month they have a rep there Esmeralda who is very unprofessional, rude and extremely inexperienced.
Every time you go in you hear here bragging about her night before being out drinking and party.....besides the point that no one goes there for the reps outside life to be described, she is ridiculously rude and never helpful...you try add a line, she doesn't even know what the promotions are or even care to ask around the other reps, she is into her own world - when you do add a line she calls the wrong customer service to connect your line, she is not updated on the roll over minutes nor the family plan.
I have my business with Verizon and my parents business with AT&T and I can clearly tell the difference in customer service at Verizon.
When I told her that she quoted wrong my new line and that she needs to pay attention because I never have this mistakes at Verizon she said "then go to Verizon
One of our lines went over the Data / it happens is fine - but in stead of actually hearing you why you are questioning the bill she points at the wrong issue and the wrong plan that she added to begin with.She talks all over you, very inconsiderate that you could be her grandmother age wise.
You may just go in there to buy a simple case not to complaint about a bill and you will be veeeery disappointed on the customer service when this rep is on the shift.
I am ready to write a check for whatever the cancellation fee is and go to Verizon with everything else we have, a true statement AT&T has the worst service in customer service at this retailer store..

GO ANYWHERE ELSE BUT HERE !!!</Review>

tuday around 5:30pm i arrived and had to wait in line for a while.  when it got to my turn i was helped by a rude manager named "isidro " he denied service due to damage on a phone that had been examined before with no problem and he refused to change it.  he said to go to a different store to see if they could help me.  that he needed a manager to override it.  being a manager himself he refused to do it. he said to go to a real at&t store cause apparently they couldnt help.<//Review>

Jonathan was extremely helpful. He did a very good job in assisting us with finding a style, with sizing and with recommendations. I would highly recommend this store to anyone interested in big sized clothing. Awesome customer service!</text>

Will definitely be coming here and totally recommend to all guys who have trouble finding some bigger size clothing. I used to shop at jcp and they have limited there selection over time and although some places carry a decent fit size I like my clothes slightly bigger for comfort. This place has a great selection of very nice clothing. Slightly on the more expensive side I'd say but its worth paying the money to not spend all the extra time looking for good clothing. They have a great clearance section as well. The employees are very helpful and make you feel very comfortable. 10/10 would recommend to friends and family and will definitely be coming here alot more in the future. 👍🏿<//Review>

Actually found my size shoes. Very hard to find clothes and shoes that fit me. size 15+ shoes available. Some in store but if your looking for work boots or shoes look at their website. Very nice workers also. -Kurt P.< /Text>

They are always willing to help you when you need it.  Their prices are a little in the high side but you do get what you pay for. I Highly recommend this store. We’ve also been to their store in Las Vegas (which is huge) and their store in San Leandro. Both very nice!</text>< Pics>

<Text>Worst experience ever!
First off I bought a shirt for my husband for Father's Day in the store and bought a shirt on line through the store . Well, I was told it was going to be in the store before Father's Day ( I paid extra shipping fee, two days)
Come the day for pick up, I receive no call. So I called and went to the store, they mentioned well we do not do shipping on the weekend.
Okay that blew my husbands gift!!!
So come Monday, again no call.
I called the store and told store manager what happened, well she looked into it.. NOW, I get well we emailed you last week that the shirt was out of stocked!!!
So I said fine, I just want my money back. They said you have to call another number, but your card was not charged yet..
I said that's funny because looking at my bank account(in which I called my bank) IT WAS CHARGED.
So in calling this other number, they told me yet again: They did not charge my card, again I had to explain what happened.
So now they say I have to wait 5- 7 days to get my money.
So no shirt, no money, no sorry. I am waiting for my refund.

I highly do not recommend this store, or at least do not buy it online< /Text>< user_name>

Very helpful staff and great selection of clothes. I always get frustrated when shopping in regular stores for sizes 3xlt to 4xlt but they have that and then some. Email and store promos offer a decent price for most clothes. Some items can be pricey but you get what you pay for as far quality. They have a great suit selection with an in house tailor that can make you look sharp. Overall a great place to shop for bigger guys.< /review>

Always great service. The manager has been there awhile and always provides the best service. Little pricey but they have sales all the time. Sign up for rewards program and you get free money and or great coupons in the mail.< /text>

Always a great shopping experience and I hate shopping for clothes. Cody always greets me with a friendly smile when I stumble into his store and today I was given superb customer assistance from their store associate Bryan!

The styles of clothing, available sizes, and their sales rack selections keep me from shopping anywhere else. If your an XL kind of guy who hates to shop for clothes...this is the store you need to visit.<//Text>

I haven't been there in years and I'm so glad I went today! It's so clean and the animals seem well cared for. Zookeeper were very knowledgeable and friendly. What a great experience! I plan to go back soon 🙂🐆🦓< /Review>

Great place for what it was!! Nice exhibits, various attractions (stingray bay, petting zoo, feed giraffes, etc) and food prices were reasonable at the cafe.  First time taking the kids; had a season pass for kids and I.  A lot bigger than what it looks like on the outside. We all enjoyed our time. We have yet to feed the giraffes and finish the African Adventure (which was pretty impressive). Will definitely be back!!< /review>

Grab your Camera it's A great day at the zoo. All of the great animals a zoo should have but not the crazy crowds of the big city zoos. Feeding the giraffes are a quick fun thing all age kids and kid like adults can do. Make sure to see the bird show. You will be amazed how close they fly over the heads of the audience. Be sure to take the little ones to see the dinosaurs. Who doesn't wonder what it was like when  these animals roamed the earth.
Bring a picnic or eat just a few feet away from what looks like African tundra. Too many other areas to mention so get a pass and go as often as you like. You will see something new every time. Pro tip get the parking pass and use it here and at its fullest at the Shinzen Friendship Garden over and over again.<//review>

This place was great!!! Very nice and cheap fun for the kiddos. Can bring your own water and snacks in. Also 2 food courts which are still fairly cheap to have a nice lunch in the park.<//Text>

<text>Come see the baby rhinoceros! The Fresno Zoo has made a lot of improvements since I moved here over 20 years ago. When I first moved to Fresno I took my wife and kids to the Fresno Zoo. It was a traumatic experience. The animals were kept in horrendous conditions. We never went back. Today was our first time back. I was very impressed with the new exhibits that are much, much larger and more humane. I would go back again.</text>< Time>

<review>I had a trip from LA to SF and decided to stop for a lunch in Fresno Town. I looked at the map and saw a zoo near the place I was having lunch. So I decided to check them out real quick and continue my trip! But OMG this turned out to be the best ZOO I’ve even been in a whole world!!!
You can feed giraffe, touch the stingray, and real rhinos walk like they are cool in their habitat! Amazing feelings! We’ve spend there almost 3 hours, zoo is HUGE! Memories for entire life guaranteed 👍</review><GmapID>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6<//GmapID><Response>None<//Response><Name>Krystyna Sylyvonchyk< /Name><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJpVtIYW9-XvkLqlLrYxpcVSTsgJpHCaX24M-W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBL1VlIGx9bxuRC9Pf0ngD-FV1gBx77KYJcaPz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Date>1620132030945<//Date><user_id>118024445207301997117< /user_id>< rate>

Best zoo I’ve been to! Really clean, the animals are very well taken care of, and the staff is very knowledgeable. On top of all that the prices are very reasonable from the admission to the food and even the souvenirs were affordable. The food was very good for a zoo and even though there is a lot of construction I can’t wait to see all the new exhibits they are making and it does not take away from the experience.</review>

I just love the Fresno Chaffee Zoo. I have been going since I was a little girl. I really enjoy all the new attractions they are have installed. I plan on going this year.  We just went to the zoo this week. It was wonderful and we enjoyed ourselves and we were able to stroll at our leisure and there was plenty of shade to enjoy all that is offered. Can’t wait to visit the Kingdom of Asia when it’s open.< /Text>

Had a lot of fun. It's really a nice place to visit. The dinosaur exhibit was amazing, wow really awesome. I can't wait for the new animal exhibit to open, with tigers and other awesome animals. So worth the price.<//Review>

<review>Nice zoo worth to visit! You can see so many special creatures, different while having the similarities, hinting there is a Creator behind all these. Suggest 3 to 4 hours to pace through entire zoo with curious little ones!< /review><Gmap_id>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6</Gmap_id><Date>1622761238791<//Date>< Rate>

Good family experience. Enjoyed the animals there. Bathrooms could have used some tidying up. Not many drink stations, or areas to cool down. I’d recommend going using cooler months. Would like more animal interactions. It was easy to purchase tickets online and avoid the long line.<//text>

<text>Ample parking, do come prepared to pay $5 to access the park in which zoo is included. This is separate from the fee to access the zoo.
At the time of my visit there was much construction underway. I look forward to visiting the new exhibits when they are completed. I enjoyed the exhibits currently open, especially those I could walk through as with the birds. I loved that the exhibits are designed for the animals to roam or fly, with beautiful landscaping and ample water features.
I'm not a fan of children, so very glad I was able to purchase my ticket online for when the park opens at 9am and the hot, tired shrieking truly got started. Clean and strategically placed restrooms always a bonus.< /text>< Time>

I Came to the zoo with a 9 and11 year old. We were at the zoo for about three hours.  The kids were bored and all in our group disappointed.
The zoo could easily improve its customer satisfaction. We really had no idea how to explore the zoo. Here is an idea:  as soon as you enter the facility have a spot separated by fences for about 10 to15 separate zoo walks each exploring a different highlights of the zoo. The tour would start/finish at the same place. The finishing tour group would then line up for a different tour. In a period of two to three hours most of the zoo would have been seen.
These tours would be covered by the entrance fee. Don’t charge another fee. You could let each tour leader accept tips.
As it’s set up now, I will never return to your zoo.< /text>

This Zoo never fails to amuse our family. We get season passes every year and we go almost every week. It's such a great experience to get out of the city for a while and just be around amazing animals. Our kids love love the petting zoo. We figure it's cheaper to buy a zoo pass and have them enjoy this experience than try and get a pet. Lol but overall great place to visit< /Text>

<review>Love all the new changes to the zoo and they haven't stopped. Working on an all new Asian area with hippo and more. It is so peaceful and relaxing there. Had a great dinner at Kopje Lodge where the rhinos seem to walk right up to you, really cool. The staff is for the most part friendly and willing to  answer any questions you have about the animals. Nice relaxing evening out. Not to pricey for members, I strongly recommend this because of all the discounts. 👍👍😁<//review>< time>

<review>We are members of the zoo. We think its worth it and really enjoy the zoo. The bird show is great! Getting to feed a giraffe 🦒 is the coolest!
Lots of things to see and do and a lot of fun even for younger age children</review>< Pictures>

My kids had a great time here at the zoo in Fresno our first time attending (we’re new residents to Fresno from the Bay Area) the most fascinating part was when we had our first time experience feeding the giraffes super fun the best times to attend are the earlier the better closer to when they open bc of parking space it’s the perfect family outing esp when it’s beautiful out also they had an awesome Zoorassic park my son is obsessed w dinosaurs so it worked out perfect he was absolutely fascinated so worth every Penny the priceless look on his face thank you for making our money worth it & such enjoyable experience we can’t wait to go back again</review>

The Fresno zoo is awesome! They have great programs for the animals. The enclosures are large and well-kept. Plenty of opportunities for kids to be hands-on. The restaurant is surprisingly good. Never been disappointed with the food.<//Text>

<text>We've gotten family season passes to the Chaffee Zoo for 4 years straight. It's a great atmosphere and will always support our local zoo. Came here as a kid with my great grandma once a month or so and have fond memories here. Now I'm making memories with my 2 kids. 115 bucks for season pass and 35 or 40 for the zoorassic park season pass exhibit. It's worth it. We come once a week at least just to get the kids out and see some exotic animals. We've had our son's birthday here and been to another boys birthday and the staff are very accommodating. The food in the Africa area is also pretty good. Better then fast food but not quite restaurant style. Bird shows are always nice. I do wish they would open the path from the reptile house to the Sea Lions as that was open when I was a kid and since that area is a dead end there isn't alot of incentive to go over there.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

They're always building something new, making repeat visits worth it. Feels like a smaller version of the amazing San Diego Safari zoo. All the staff are exceptionally knowledgeable. Thanks to measure Z, it's super affordable as well. Worth the visit, even during covid<//Review>

Feeding the giraffes was fun and the dinosaur exhibit was neat. But you have to pay extra which I didn't like. A lot of exhibits were under construction.</review>< Pics>

<review>This place has definitely gotten better with their exhibits. I wasn't born and raised here but my wife was and she has mentioned how much it's gotten better for the animals. They have added many exhibits and are still expanding.

Definitely recommend this zoo! Don't let the area where the zoo is located scare you from coming. It's absolutely beautiful!</review><user>113290824781967155512<//user>< Resp>

We were there last Friday. We bought our tickets in advance online. When we got there there was a huge line for people with no tickets, we had no line since we had tickets. Being Easter weekend, there was A LOT of people, but we really enjoyed it. There's a lot of construction going on, so some exhibits were closed. We loved the Zoorassic World! Our son loved feeding the Giraffes. Food was great!< /Text>

The zoo has come a long way from when I was last there. Much more natural habitats for a large number of exhibits. The kids loved it.</Text>

The park restroom aren't clean at all, broken glass at the picnic tables and I had to clean it up myself in order for the kids not to get cut. Men were using the restrooms with the door wide open and little kids playing and running around, if I can see it I know they seen it too. I know they work so hard on restoring the Zoo and Storyland but don't forget about the restrooms and the play area and the picnic area these places need tending too also. You can catch diseases in unclean restrooms, toilets wouldn't flush. But I already know better I had my Lysol spray, wipes paper, towels and each time I had to go to the restroom I made sure I sprayed it down.<//review>

<date>1615689821145</date><rate>4</rate><Text>Beautiful zoo. Some areas are under construction and I am sure it will be even better. It was true when they said it's better than Oakland's or San Jose's, Fresno is bigger. I loved how there's an elotero man and ice cream at the entrance/exit. Parking is 5$ and there's  a lot of space to park.

There is one thing I didn't  like which is that they charge for the Dinosaur area is just a walk through I believe it should be imcluded with the entrance fee but oh well it was still a nice experience.

Buy your tickets online it will save you a lot of time and you will be happy you get to not stand in line :) have fun.</Text>< Pictures>

Too much construction going on to raise the prices as high as they did. Almost $20 per adult, yet I did not see one monkey, elephant, tiger, lion, chimpanzees, none of that. Saw a few birds, pet some goats they're trying to say are exotic animals, & had to constantly dodge all the wild squirrels. In fact, only 2 stars because most of the staff were friendly, knowledgeable & genuinely cared.</Review>

Do not use the drink vending machine. Don't know how how long those drinks have been there. One of our 2 drinks came out with mold flowing around inside. Zoo still nice. Lots of people. Zoorassic was nice, not a many dinosaur as I expected< /text>

It’s a nice zoo, small but a good amount of animals to see. A big section of it is under construction so I can’t wait to be back to see it finished.< /Text>

<rate>5</rate><review>We had a great day at the Fresno Zoo! It was our first time here so we booked an early time. It was a great idea because the park was not crowded at all and the animals seemed to be pretty active! The park design is nicely laid out, with restrooms and little spots to snack along the way. Feeding the giraffe and the sting rays were probably my favorite part! Make sure to buy the all inclusive passes they are the best way to get your money's worth. Make sure your phone is charged so you can scan your tickets if you buy them online. Great way to spend the day and inexpensive too!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Review>This place is truly amazing I buy my family a zoo pass every year combined with the fresno park entry pass the kids love it the best part is I have toddler so if she starts to act up or get cranky we just leave and come back another day without feeling like we wasted a lot of money. It also leaves me more money throughout the year to buy snacks and toys while visiting.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<review>Still one of my FAVORITE zoos. They are still under construction because they are planning to add more animals and sites to visit but the safari area is amazing!! Not to mention, the jurassic area with moving dinosaurs is a hit for the kids. Definitely returning soon.</review>< response>

Me and my boyfriend went for an early anniversary gift on Feb 21st and it was absolutely awesome! Yes, since covid was happening, we pre-order tickets and were well aware of what was not showing since construction. Even with the construction, it was absolutely fun!<//text>

<Review>It's still a great place to go. I like what they did with directing traffic through exhibits. It limits bunching up and keeps people safe. Also it allowed us to see everything they have to offer without getting lost or backtracking and within a reasonable amount of time. And we didn't feel rushed. My son loved it!< /Review><pics>None<//pics><gmap_id>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6< /gmap_id><UserId.>118400914318504050512< /UserId.>< Resp>

I love our local zoo. We get season tickets every year. If your local you should too. Lots to see with the safari adventure, my favorite, making your trip more then worth it. I'm giving it four stars since it can't beat San Diego and Fresno doesn't offer enough attractions around it to make far travel worth it. However you also won't break the bank. All animal lovers around and or Traveling through,  your support goes to a great cause and doesn't disappoint.<//review>

<Review>Nice small zoo in Fresno for the family to spend quality time together. They have animal shows, a petting zoo, and a pretty wide range of animals. There's snack bars and a restaurant in the park,  as well, to appease your starving stomachs from walking around in the zoo. The zoo also provides a place for outdoor parties. You'd just have to reserve it.<//Review>< pics>

I have been to the San Diego zoo and the LA zoo, but this place has so much to offer and is just a delight to be at and having a great family day. I am so shocked and thrilled at the amount of animal enrichment, and habitat quality and care that the zookeepers provide for all of their animals needs both physically and mentally.

My family and I enjoyed this zoo and continue to contribute to this amazing zoos potential to the Central valley.<//text>

I had a good time spending my last day of spring break. I purchased the ticket online for $24 ea and I got free for all exhibit. Went there in the morning at 9, it wasn't a lot of people and the weather wasn't so hot. My favorite part was the bird show and dinosaurs.</Text>

<review>Haven't been to the zoo in ages. Went recently with the family and it's a nice little experience. Get some good walking in too. Unfortunately with the construction, some of the more "fun" animals to see are not available. But overall it's a pretty good zoo in Fresno's backyard.<//review><user>110272798874149111121< /user>< gmap_id>

<resp>None< /resp><Review>What Chaffee done to the zoo from when I was a kid is great. The improvement look fantastic. The zoo was crowded but I can understand people like myself wanted to get out. Good to see everyone following the mask rules. Some of the exhibits had lines to enter them. Currently I see construction going on in the center of the zoo for an Asian area animals and if it's anything like the at African area it will be good.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< userid>

Great little zoo... Lots of interactive exhibits... You can even feed the giraffes! My hubby free up in San Diego so needless to say we've been to the SD Zoo lots of times, but you can't feed the giraffes in SD so I think that makes or zoo special<//Text>

<Text>This is a wonderful zoo for the location and price but we have had a few frustrating issues.  The animal enclosures are all very large and do a good job of replicating the animal's natural habitats.  They are building a new section that looks very promising with some exciting new animals.  We especially enjoy the seal habitat, the African savanna area, and interactive areas like the stingray pool, petting zoo, and bird enclosures.  Some of the employees are a little too ambitious about enforcement of the mask rules considering everything is mostly outdoors.  The family membership is a good deal but we were disappointed with the dinosaur exhibit.  We paid the $36 to be able to get in all year only to have it cancelled after 2 months because they closed temporarily.  We emailed them about it but didn't not receive an extension or refund.< /Text><user>108624414504229023013<//user><rating>3< /rating>< resp>

It’s a zoo what i can I say. Small city zoo. Has few activities which kids loved was feeding the giraffe. Kids were very excited to see the dinosaurs. It would be nicer if it was more motion activated. But still we had a blast. There is story land next door for rides which is closed on Monday and Tuesday.< /Text>

Not sure if we are even getting in. Such a beautiful day but the lines are long and well the closest restroom isn't even open...time to rethink " a day at the zoo ". Having Playland would have helped out too! ...okay just found out you need reservations to get in....<//Text>

Great place to enjoy time with your family and see beautiful animals! BUT when we went in 03/21 it was super packed, long lines for everything and was under so much construction that a lot of our fave animals weren't even out! I hope the improvements are worth it because i felt a little underwhelmed.  I would suggest you go when the new exhibit is done. To beat the long line buy tickets online beforehand.<//text>

It would be 5 stars if not for the recent mask requirement. We're literally outside. Plus they limit capacity. There's no reason to require masks outside at the zoo when you can dine inside a restaurant without a mask. Just saying.<//text>

It's a smaller zoo but the animals are well cared for and seem a lot healthier AND happier than compared to animals at other zoos I've been to. The staff is nice and the park is clean, my son loves it and I bet he'll love it even more when they finish their expansions. Can't wait to see the end results.</Review>

Great place to bring the kids, suggest earlier the better. And buy tickets in advance!! Avoid the lines. Go early leave as soon as your kid get upset. Then come back for evening relaxing. Food was fast and perfect. Line get long if you don't reserve.</Review>

I been member from this zoo! For 5 years already! And let me tell you, in my opinion this zoo is much better and pretty than L.A. ZOO! Every year they have fun festival. Every year it get better. The food is very affordable and delicious. The admission price are very fair. It would definitely recommend this place to anyone! Trust me anyone would enjoy it. 🙃<//Review>

Most of the food we tried to order they were out and it was only 3pm they close at 7pm. We walked a lot didn't see that many animals and was expecting more from the zoorassic park.

Awesome zoo, definitely top 5 in the state of CA. I hadn't been since before the African Adventures expansion and it makes it feel like a whole new zoo. A lot of construction during my visit due to their kingdoms of Asia expansion being built, can't wait to see how the zoo looks in a few more years!!<//Text>

Big zoo some really cool exhibits (zoorastic dinosaurs and feeding the Sting Ray petting and feeding the giraffes) but unless you have the premium entry they all cost extra. The whole Asian Kingdom exhibit was closed for construction. Our tickets were gifted to us I would have been disappointed if I'd paid $25 a piece to get in (for the premium pass) once the Asian Kingdom is completed it might be worth another visit.< /Text>

Non-member lines were insane couldn't reserve tickets until 5pm park closes at 6pm wasn't a good deal but got to become a member the family pack is a good deal and purchase some add-ons and we're set for the whole year. Park like always is amazing kids will love it.< /text>

The Zoo is always a fun place for a family gathering, even with covid restrictions it's always fun to see the sea lions or feed the giraffes. The staff are all friendly and helpful and there are plenty of places to rest should you need to. Highly recommend a visit now, and even more so later on after restrictions are lifted!<//Text>

It would be 5 stars if not for the recent mask requirement. We're literally outside. Plus they limit capacity. There's no reason to require masks outside at the zoo when you can dine inside a restaurant without a mask. Just saying.</Text>

<Text>What Chaffee done to the zoo from when I was a kid is great. The improvement look fantastic. The zoo was crowded but I can understand people like myself wanted to get out. Good to see everyone following the mask rules. Some of the exhibits had lines to enter them. Currently I see construction going on in the center of the zoo for an Asian area animals and if it's anything like the at African area it will be good.<//Text><Response>None</Response><Pictures>None< /Pictures><name>david morais</name>< user>

Great little zoo... Lots of interactive exhibits... You can even feed the giraffes! My hubby free up in San Diego so needless to say we've been to the SD Zoo lots of times, but you can't feed the giraffes in SD so I think that makes or zoo special< /review>

<Text>I'm sure it's better than the experience I had. I went during covid-19 so there were no maps for me to hold. I didn't realize there was a second better eatery further down. Also, there were many areas closed for construction or due to covid-19 safety. I plan to go again in the future when everything is reopened because it definitely is worth going again.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<review>The water bottle they offer are terrible. 5 bottles for about $18, no one finish their bottle and I didn't even want to open mine. It had an awful after taste. Soon after, my 7 year old niece, who was kinda drinking it, threw up and she didn't want to drink the water again.  Also, there's no tigers or bears< /review>< Pictures>

<review>This place is nice for kids, I was looking for a place to park my car for about 30 minutes but that’s probably because it was Saturday not too many animals the place is huge it would take you couple of hours to walk around, kids really love the new place they have built with all the dinosaurs 🦕<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIVb042o5rKG2jHm5d47rON32x1OyOnGPtGt_9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJigE_LdCVfSuuB2HZRNnlkNSdMjf7GYWDG9HJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>All of my family including little ones enjoyed this place. The aquarium is nicely presented for children  and they have small indoor playground for kids under 5. Only one downside was the food. It was just okay. Pizza, sandwiches, and salads were not so great but eatable. Recommend any one with little kids as well as big one.<//Review><Name>Wanda Porter<//Name><gmap_id>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6<//gmap_id><time>1610906892807<//time>< user_id>

We love bringing our little ones to this zoo. The giraffe feeding is the favorite stop for our family. Going to pet the farm animals isn’t quite hitting the list yet at least.  We love stopping by to see the tiger, rhinos, and the elephants. There are a lot of animals to see and the enclosures are well kept. Not only that but the zoo keepers are highly knowledgeable.

The cafe at the zoo is great also with tasty and healthy options for kids and parents. The membership is well worth and has paid for itself many times over with the number of times we go a year. Not only that but the entrance line for members is always much shorter or nonexistent.

The Fresno zoo is a great place to spend time as a family.<//Text>

I was truly impressed by the renovations that have been done to the zoo. It's nothing like it was 20 someting years ago. The animlas have more space and it has a very natural habitat feel to it. I loved it!!!<//text>

<Review>There is currently construction of new exhibits in process, and that is fairly intrusive but at the same time well managed and didn't dampen our day. Almost everyone was wearing masks. The animals had a lot of space and there was ample viewing room. We had a great time.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

This zoo is so big, so you get a lot of exercise. Wear tennis shoes. So much interaction for the kids even Durning a pandemic! They have sanitizing stations everywhere and they have signs to remind you to wear masks. They take precautions to make sure people are six feet apart. Right now in the month of September through December they're going to have a dinosaur exhibition after those months it will be removed it really is cool and Worth to see there's even some dinosaurs that spray you with water. There is a food court you can relax and eat your food and there's a separate part to the food court where you could take your children and give them a bottle or help them nap or breastfeed your children. The bathroom seemed pretty clean it looks like they tend to them regularly. All the animals seem to be out and enjoying the warm weather they have misters for them or little waterfalls or some sort of water interaction so that they stay cool. You could feed the stingrays feed the giraffes for a couple of dollars per person. Right now you can not feed or pet the goats and sheep because of the covid 19. There is a play area that's currently closed for kids that is a water park the only thing available on it is the shower heads that you can use to cool down. The ice cream cones are only a dollar and they fill them up and put them also in a cup so it's basically like ice cream for two people for only $1. the sea lions are very active and I would suggest going underneath where the little cave area is so you can see them swimming underwater it's a great picture opportunity. They have little stands where you can pose for pictures everywhere! The family pass sis worth the money if you go frequently. If you love animals there's definitely lots to look at and they're very interactive. I personally had a nice experience with a macaw in the rainforest area if you say hello to him he will say hello back or if you dance and tell him to dance with you he'll dance back.<//text>

Very pleasantly surprised at what this zoo offered. My toddler and preschooler were excited to even forget their nap. In just 5 hours, we enjoyed a bird show, lion training, giraffe feeding, petting goats and alpacas, an adorable baby Rhino with it's family and so much more!

And here's the best part - all of this for sub-$10 per person!!! Definitely worth visiting!</Review>

Very nice smaller zoo. They need a few more bathrooms throughout the park. Their exhibits are pretty cool and they're growing. Its too bad though you have to pay extra for some of the attractions.<//Text>

I went today waited in line for almost 4 hours and the line only moved a few feet within those hours. Once we asked why the line wasn’t moving the workers told us that the zoo exceeded their capacity. Yet they were still letting in people that pre paid tickets and even people with memberships( or people becoming members). It was not fair that they weren’t letting us in because the zoo “Exceeded it’s capacity “ yet they were still letting people in.therefore we were never going to go in because it obviously was never going to get below capacity due to them letting dozens of people in still. NEVER going back.</Review>

It is nice since they expanded. Just kinda disappointed there was so much construction going on and so much was closed off. It will be an even better experience when everything is complete.<//Text>

Flat out great zoo, and should be for a city this size.
The Sea Lion Cove is an award winning presentation.
I'm sure the African Savannah will also win some kind of zoo awards too.
The African Savannah cabana food court is incredible. Great spot to rest up.
The LIVE bird show everyday, is over the top great. Maybe my fave.
The walk through bird cages are as good as any zoo in CA.
You can spend the better part of a day here.
Also, if you like taking photos of flying birds, the park pond outside the zoo is the best action around. Many different varieties.</Review>

<Review>Had such a great time!! The new Safari exhibit with the Elephants, Wildebeest and Giraffes is so awesome! And there is a awesome space to eat and watch the whole exhibit while the kids play on some rocks and the adults can relax! There is a really nice firepit too for when it's cold. And there are multiple stand up heaters to keep you warm too. Really nice job they are doing to the zoo!</Review><user_id>106974128302359844569< /user_id>< resp>

<text>Took my grandbaby on a Saturday for sonething to do.  We live in Los Angeles and have never gone to the Fresno Zoo.  Parking is horrible!! Waited in line a hour or more. Should have bought online. Who knew? Just a day outting. Well we didn't see many animals and the few we did see was sleep, sleeping oor whatever. Had to pay $4 each to see the stingrays abd $2 if you wanted to feed them...should  have been included in the price of admission. No I won't be going back!😥<//text><Date>1620947876570< /Date>< Name>

Very long line, but great place to go.  Best to get your reservation online because once they reach a certain capacity, they cap it and won't let the line move until people leave.< /Review>

Had a great experience. I always come to the zoo at least once a year with the entire family. I really like the new additions they've made to the park over the years.</review>

<Response>None<//Response><Text>Our family of 6 had a great day here while visiting from out of town. Good value. We did the total experience ticket so the Zoorasic Park, giraffe feeding, and stingray bay experiences were highlights. A few exhibits are closed for Covid and a fair amount of the zoo is under construction but we still had a great experience. The bird show was fun as well ... Not quite to the level I've seen at other zoos but still a great way to sit down for a while and be entertained.

Seems like they could have been doing elephant shows and sea lion shows. But hey, Covid puts a damper on things and is probably affecting all that.

I'd definitely recommend it for families to spend a day here. One of the highlights of our fresno visit.

I dropped $80 for lunch but the food was good and prepared on site. The wait for the food was a bit longer than expected and they didn't honor my no cheese request on my salad.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOA1CRcoxfMlDlZaQcoKrCrPyuN2N2zg1HZFuET=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><time>1618102143446< /time>< userid>

I love the zoo and since they were making reservations  times I figured it wouldn’t be so busy I wanted to take my son to the zoo for the first time and it felt so unsafe with a whole bunch of people not wearing masks we literally left with an hour of getting there because of how unsafe we felt my whole family is vaccinated but my 11 month old son is not and the amount of people not wearing masks was ridiculous the zoo really needs to enforce mask wearing and have certain areas where they can take masks off I won’t be coming back for a while</Text>

Worst visit ever. Will not return. Line was long, and we got close enough to the front they stopped letting people in that were buying tickets at the zoo. They said it was because they reached their capacity but yet they were letting people with memberships in. It’s not right and not fair, if you reached capacity it should apply to everyone. They told us that they prioritized members first, shouldn’t all guest be prioritized? They didn’t allow people to buy general admission tickets but yet they allowed people to buy membership packages and were allowed in. That makes no sense, they were not organized at all. My family and I will not be going back.< /review>

Have not been here in over 30 years. My mom wanted to go and I was more than happy to take her, just like she used to bring me when I was a child. Bought tickets for breakfast with the animals. It was fun and lots of people. So many changes from over 30 years ago. We enjoyed ourselves.</review>

Strict COVID guild lines in place if you care to know that information. Also, I highly suggest getting the zoo's membership if you visit quite frequently, & of you don't I bet getting the membership will make you want to go more. Such a fun time for the family, even see just couples there as well. Great for everyone of all ages.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<review>The park itself is cool..there is a lot of construction. HOWEVER this new "zoosaurus" that just ope ed was pretty cool. A lot of different dinos that look extremely good. The African Safari has been tremendous add in. Once the zoo is fully finished it will be AMAZING and definitely ey catching with all the different  animals.</review><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

Awesome experience!
The zoo was clean. The staff are very helpful and friendly.
The exhibits were not only educational but fun.
Most importantly, the animals look healthy and have adequate room, water, shade, misters, and fans. This is very important in this valley heat.

My 6 y/o had a blast.< /Text>

Zoo is clean and animals look in great condition. COVID precautions are non-existent, we went (purchased the tickets online) there was a huge line and the people were piled with no guidance or signage to what the "lines" were for.  Inside the park people were not wearing the masks and continued their trip instead of taking their "breather" (break from the mask) off to the side.  No one was around enforcing masks to be on for the sake of the kids. Also kids were all over the structures without masks and no sanitizer was near some of the structures kids were on.<//text>

They have definitely come a long way! I absolutely adore the lodge next to the animals ! The animals also look semi free since there is so much space in that enclosure.< /Text>

At the moment due to Covid-19 many attractions are closed. The zoo has many attractions under construction as well, but prices for tickets are still the same. They should have some sort of a discount until attractions become fully available. The restrooms were also very dirty and unkept, no toilet tissue in one of them. Not the experience we had hoped for.< /Review>

<Time>1615821072075</Time><Review>I have always enjoyed visiting Chaffee Zoo, but this last visit was a bit different.  I was unaware of the vast development that is taking place there which meant cramped space, no primates, where was the condore?  Empty exhibits. . . Bathrooms were dirty, empty soap containers, empty toilet paper dispensers. I think I'll wait about a year for my next possible visit.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

I'm from San Diego so I've been to their zoo and Safari Park numerous times, and they're both really cool.  But considering the new design of the Chaffee Zoo, their animals, the amenities, and just how cool the zoo is, it's really hard to beat!  It gets hot in the summer and they even have a splash park for the kids.  They've really thought of everything.  My family goes all the time...keep up the good work!< /review>< Pictures>

<rating>3</rating><Text>I love going to the zoo but today it was me and my sister , now is in a electric chair ,some of the rail are at the eye sight were it was hard to see. That is not all you had to go through the picnic area after the giraffes and that was hard to do. I think you need to have someone take a trip around the zoo in a chair. By the way she has MD so its a little hard to get around. And just a little note you need to swipe the walk way around the seals it was pretty  slipper and I was wearing shoes  not saddles. Thanks had a great time.<//Text></record>

The staff is really friendly, They all know a little bit of background most animals. You can easily spend 3 to 5 hours here.< /Text>

I wouldn't recommend visiting until the construction is done everything is being renovated and was a mess to walk around. Other than that I'd give it a 4 star< /text>

We had so much fun feeding the giraffe. It was only 3 dollars. 3 dollars is the cost to purchase a leaf of lettuce. Visited during the week and avoided all the crowds.<//Text>

<Text>My boys and I really enjoyed our animal adventure today. Just about every animal was out and about basking in the sun. It wasn't crowded and everyone for the most part wore masks. We really enjoyed feeding the giraffe. Because of social distancing we actually had a good amount of time to visit and ask questions. Everything was clean and the staff was polite and said hello all day. Great experience. We will be back soon.<//Text><userid>107613471706206064080< /userid></record></dataset><record>

Had a good experience here. A lot of different animals to see. The zoo cafe has good and affordable snacks and food. The only problem is the heat in summer so just keep some water.<//review>

Very fun zoo. The food is great and there are such variety of animals. The place is clean and it's never really SUPER busy. There's plenty to do for a day trip. The safari is beautiful and is a must see.<//Review>

Definitely recommend reserving ticket online before you go, we were able to cruise past a 100 person line and go straight in at our designated time. As far as the zoo itself it's ok in it's current state - several exhibits (including the kids area) are closed due COVID and remodel which detracted a bit from the general entrance experience (we didn't do the add-ons)< /text>

The zoo is a wonderful place to go for families or really anybody who is interested in animals.  I love that they have done such a good job using public and private finding to make such great improvements.  Makes me happy to vote for Measure Z and buy a zoo membership every time!< /text>

<Text>We love love the zoo I have been going since I was a little girl and now I have my own little girl and we go all the time I have gotten a sense pass every year. Its amazing being here when I was on leave from work I would come to the zoo every single day just to get away from life its self and just enjoy the zoo park and seeing all the animals are just amazing thank you all for being a member and supporting our zoo and all our beautiful animals that we have saved. The food could be alil cheaper cause times are very hard for everyone... and we all have more then one child these days. I feel if it was alil cheaper where people would come way more cause its alil more affordable and all that we spend their goes to supporting our animals for sure. We are headed out their today

<Review>A LOT is cut off from seeing because of construction on site, but that's not what made me give a low score.  Making my 2 year old put on a mask for just walking in the door was ridiculous.  He has a sensory disorder and won't wear one at all so threatening to not even let us in when we drove almost 45 minutes to get there put stress on me and my two small children.
Masking children is absolutely unnecessary.</Review>< rating>

<Review>This is a zoo that I love to visit with the family,  animals seem more content and healthy. The family has a chance to learn about these magnificent creatures while having a bit if interaction. For a small fee you can touch and possibly feed stingrays as well as the giraffes.< /Review><Rate>5</Rate>< date>

This is an awesome zoo. The pride of lions are so cool. They have a huge dining area and it oversees the african savannah exhibit . Gotta love being able to feed the giraffes and sting rays. Will definitely be coming back we want to see those zoo lights!< /Review>

Really really great experience. Could use a little bit more funding due to lack of space for the animals. I honestly think zoos should be huge and big so the animals have more space to run around and exercise. It seems like they were more occupied on building structures for people and customers instead of the animals. There's a crapload of parking spaces that could be modified or turned into more animal exhibits.<//text>

<Date>1557047022190< /Date><text>This zoo is amazing! It's one of my favorite zoos, after only visiting once! It's a large zoo, with tons of animals, restaurants, and nice walking paths. There are also places for younger kids do to run and play. Everything was very clean, and the animals looked like they had a bigger space to roam than most animals at other zoos that I've been too. The reptile and amphibian building was awesome. Also, the new baby rhino is ridiculously cute!!!</text>< GmapID>

<review>One of the better zoo's in California! It's clean, relatively quiet, and spacious. Most of the animals are of African original, and their habitats reflect this. You can casually walk the zoo in 3-4 hours.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<text>Fresno Zoo is a pretty fun and open space perfect for family trips! Even during the pandemic, the park is open for all to enjoy as long as you bring a mask. The park does limit how many people can enter in at one time, however so there can be a very long line for anyone who wants to buy their ticket there. Despite that though, most of the animals are still there and a new exhibit will be coming in next year!</text>< resp>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>I spend a pleasant day wandering around the zoo. The bird aviaries were plenty large enough. All animal enclosure were large and clean. The animals all seemed content except for the tiger who was continually pacing. Probably close to feeding time. I would have liked to see more animals. The setup was a little confusing. I would recommend a few footprints painted on the sidewalk to guide visitors on a complete your of the grounds. I was pleased to see a giant anteater which you don't see often at zoos. I was also pleased to see the kangaroo exhibit. All staff that I talked to were very friendly and knowledgeable. A good day.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOynQa1v8XDMAXI1cYy-ThRtLOhALvavOEB6PtV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNetzN4OckiqDB5YZqy8Qj4-rbPJ3MBP_mNSkWg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_2RA-QPMKdxfrPg1ZANLoVbrXzEKAd6sLlCW7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzPGyfkqz0erziGrZ-h6O85k0jQsEsoITfzkGa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_RMVDYDfteVLjXsN1VmxHCSLkXC5u348WSpHS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMq1vaAg88amB_ZJ0VF661doXoQC6_VA01-y3e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Incredible zoo for Fresno. Check out the bird show - we were totally surprised and impressed! Owls, talking parrots, giant cranes, cockatoos, and some other surprises.

Lots of other fun animals to see and an impressive reptile house. My kids are happy and worn out every time we visit without fail.</Review>

Awesome experience!
The zoo was clean. The staff are very helpful and friendly.
The exhibits were not only educational but fun.
Most importantly, the animals look healthy and have adequate room, water, shade, misters, and fans. This is very important in this valley heat.

My 6 y/o had a blast.</text>

At the moment due to Covid-19 many attractions are closed. The zoo has many attractions under construction as well, but prices for tickets are still the same. They should have some sort of a discount until attractions become fully available. The restrooms were also very dirty and unkept, no toilet tissue in one of them. Not the experience we had hoped for.</Text>

Zoo was a great way to get the kids out the house. We got the combo tickets that allowed us to pet the sting Rays and feed the giraffes. Definitely worth it. Kids had fun!</text>

I have always enjoyed visiting Chaffee Zoo, but this last visit was a bit different.  I was unaware of the vast development that is taking place there which meant cramped space, no primates, where was the condore?  Empty exhibits. . . Bathrooms were dirty, empty soap containers, empty toilet paper dispensers. I think I'll wait about a year for my next possible visit.</Review>

I love this zoo. I'm not from the area but visit a friend once a year or so and we go almost every time I'm here. The giraffes are my favorite followed closely by the chacoan peccaries and tropical birds. The petting zoo is a nice feature and all the animals seem happy. Keepers and volunteers are knowledgeable and friendly.
Highly recommend this zoo.</Text>

Always enjoy coming here. The employees are helpful and willing to answer any questions you may have. They take time with kids to make sure they don't feel ignored or dismissed.

I would recommend grabbing lunch here and enjoy the views of the savanna with the rhinos and elephants.<//text>

There have been so many updates, new exhibits, experiences, food choices--this zoo is a point of pride for any Fresno resident. We spend the whole morning and early afternoon and got to see everything the zoo has to offer. There are zoo staff at many of the exhibits and they were all very helpful and very knowledgeable about each animal. Would love to go back soon.</Review>< Pics>

Most of the safari animals and sea lion/seal habitat had a decent sized enclosures. Some of the other animal enclosures appeared to be far too small for the animals. The orangutan seemed incredibly depressed and looked to be lonely. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Definitely something you could do in one day.<//review>

Excellent place to spend a few hours, especially if the weather cooperates. Our son loves feeding the giraffes  and I especially like petting the sting rays. The new African Safari area is beautiful.  If you have kids, it is definitely worth investing in the annual membership.  The food in the newer section is awesome too.< /Text>

One of the best zoo I have been. It has a great collection of Africa animals, including at least 4 giraffes, 3 elephant, 3 rhinos (2 different kinds), 4 lions!!!! We went as a family trip when the zoo held it's annual Frogs & Fairytale activity. It had Disney princesses (besides Milan, Cinderella, or Rapunzel) for children to have pictures with, different art and craft activities, instant photo booth, and spot that professional helped our children to put up their make-up or face painting. We had a blast!!!!<//Text>

< review>
A few years ago this zoo was not in the best shape and was no different than any other small town zoo. In recent years, however, they have made some excellent improvements to the facility including an expansion they call African Adventure. This area is awesome and houses many animals that call Africa their natural habitat like elephants, lions, cheetahs, rhinos and giraffes (that you can feed for just $3.00) but also some not so well known or favorites animals such as wildebeests and antelopes. The animals are fairly active for being in containment which is nice to see and the staff is always do friendly and never minds when my kids ask a million questions about the animals.  The food in this expansion is great but fairly pricey. I have a family season pass for 2 adults and 3 kids (we needed to add on a child as it normally comes with just 2) which costs about $75.00-$80.00 a year which is definitely worth it if you go more than 2 times a year. The pass gives you discounts throughout the zoo on food and souvenirs as well as a admission to some special events like their ice cream social and some events not open to the general public.<//review>

<Text>I love this zoo. I'm not from the area but visit a friend once a year or so and we go almost every time I'm here. The giraffes are my favorite followed closely by the chacoan peccaries and tropical birds. The petting zoo is a nice feature and all the animals seem happy. Keepers and volunteers are knowledgeable and friendly.
Highly recommend this zoo.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8xnzd1xYb3lQlDf2wmrhCxcGjKglV4tmbxFZy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNreSReOHZgCH4jkQmPYSA_E6qh3lgxlhk_2WJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< resp>

<username>Josh Cummins<//username><text>Definitely recommend reserving ticket online before you go, we were able to cruise past a 100 person line and go straight in at our designated time. As far as the zoo itself it's ok in it's current state - several exhibits (including the kids area) are closed due COVID and remodel which detracted a bit from the general entrance experience (we didn't do the add-ons)<//text></record>

Feeding the giraffes, viewing the lion, lioness, & cub,  and the petting zoo animals are my favorite areas! The admissions cost is only $10 to get in, and it's for a good cause. The money you pay to enter is used to maintain the place and keep things running. I especially like the African Safari that was added. The Chafee Zoo has definitely been remodeled for the better.<//text>

Excellent small zoo.  African section is great.  Visit it early, because it has the least shade.  Asia is very shady.  Some very nice exhibits with great viewing in areas with room for the animals to roam.< /Review>

Awesome new renovation completed. Many many months waiting for them to finish the whole project. They are done and i must say great job Fresno County. I am glad to see what all the taxes went to be beneficial to the community around the county. Not just Fresno so come check it out people, and bring the kids.</Text>

The Fresno Chaffee Zoo has been a part of Fresno for decades and has entertained kids and adults and continues to still today. I have very fond memories of it and I'm happy to see it still be a relevant part of Fresno. Thankfully there is continuous expansion in the park and improvements meaning it should hopefully be around for many more years inspiring young minds.</Text>

They do a wonderful job here. Every time I bring my daughter it's a new and amazing experience. We love it so much we got a membership. They also have this awesome water area for the kids that is located to the left of the pathway leading to the African safari area.</Text>

<text>Horrible. There is NOTHING, plus if your not a member you have to wait HOURS. EVEN if the members line is empty. The animals look very trapped and anxious, like their pacing around looking stressed AND if you do get inside there is nothing to see, it is very small and dirty, oh and the employes are S, so rude rude and CARELESS. So, if you are thinking of going somewhere on your days off find a better place. Somewhere worth it. If one of you employes are reading this and CARE please ( if you don't want to go back in bankrupcy) fix this. I don't mind paying for membership,but be fair to the people who don't, or the people who buy tickets online!!! So just don't go, Again,TERRIBLE, terrible place.</text>< Resp>

Such a great day to break away from the COVID madness.   Park was super clean, lots of animals out and about to see.   Didn’t have to search for them... even in the hot part of the day!  The layout of the park provides LOTS of shade throughout, for the animals and the guests. The habitats are well cared for and staff is very knowledgeable, friendly and helpful!!  They are at every turn ready to assist. We didn’t realize we could take our own food and snacks on so we were prepared to pay outrages prices for food.  To our delight, prices  were really reasonable; 4 of us ate a beautiful healthy lunch for $48, including drinks!! The Zoo is taking the precautions as directed by the state, so just 2-3 areas require a mask.  Overall it was a great visit!!  Will definitely return!</text>

Very cool place kinda pricey for really not many animals but cool to take your kids and to get out of the house for the day...$18.00 for one adult.
Parking is $5.00
Handicap is free parking

I would go again..

Please like if I helped you
Thanks..< /text>

<Rate>2</Rate><review>It was clean and staff was great but the enclosures are way too small. The tiger was so stressed it was pacing terribly, overly skinny as well. Tbh a lot of animals seemed small in size compared to others. Quite a few had such depressed, sad faces, and were constantly pacing, it broke my heart!! The tiger was the saddest of them all 😥If you can't handle seeing animals in stress this isn't the place to go right now, maybe it'll change once they finish construction on the new habitat. Zoo needs to make better enclosures so the animals aren't so depressed asap.<//review>< Pics>

A great way to spend some family time. The zookeepers were so nice and so informative. We had a great time!! Between the great weather and the animals being in good spirits it was a wonderful trip</Review>

Really nice, full featured zoo! Constantly updating and building new and creative exhibits. The Marketing/Promotion Team for the zoo has done an excellent job coming up with ideas to attract visitors all year round. We just went back for our third year of Zoolights where the entire park is adorned in Christmas lights! Take the family and enjoy!<//text>

<Review>Very helpful and friendly staff, beautiful animals, and half-decent food. The gift shop is a little ridiculous with how expensive it is, so maybe bring a limited amount of cash so your kids can't pressure you to buy the store. I didn't take any pictures for the second half of our visit because it started raining pretty hard, but there really is a lot to see there.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFqVs9tDWH2rPSMOtxb4dWu2iqDBnP0-_8RG7N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoszOKaA135GCfBo1rnk_7Zvt-z6e6i8jdnEnd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnY0fRoniBmiByUwaQ5eTaavIGgBYF9cZFT1Ri=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Could use a little bit more funding due to lack of space for the animals. I honestly think zoos should be huge and big so the animals have more space to run around and exercise. It seems like they were more occupied on building structures for people and customers instead of the animals. There's a crapload of parking spaces that could be modified or turned into more animal exhibits.< /Review>< Date>

<text>it used to be fun a few years back, but sometime between then and now they began putting money over customers and safety protocols. the lines are so incredibly long, and ticket buyers arent even payed attention to. while members are allowed it when the zoo is quote on quote “at full capacity”, everyone else is forced to wait outside even as people exit. even when theres no members in line, noone else (even people who purchased their tickets online!) is allowed in ?/!:?)3 i saw múltiple people going to employees to complain about this, but still they keep being unfair. its not worth the wait tbh ! its pretty dirty and safety protocols for covid 19 are rarely followed. i hope the quality of the place improves , but for now im afraid i wont be going for a long while<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6</GmapID></record>

It's not so enjoyable because of all this covid-19 stuff going on. Reptile house is closed. Some animals are being moved to another place/exhibit, so they're gone 😔. MUST wear mask entire time. Signs throughout the park to try & control the direction of traffic. Not the best thought out plan for "flow of traffic".< /review>

<text>This zoo is amazing! It's one of my favorite zoos, after only visiting once! It's a large zoo, with tons of animals, restaurants, and nice walking paths. There are also places for younger kids do to run and play. Everything was very clean, and the animals looked like they had a bigger space to roam than most animals at other zoos that I've been too. The reptile and amphibian building was awesome. Also, the new baby rhino is ridiculously cute!!!< /text>< time>

< Review>
We love love the zoo I have been going since I was a little girl and now I have my own little girl and we go all the time I have gotten a sense pass every year. Its amazing being here when I was on leave from work I would come to the zoo every single day just to get away from life its self and just enjoy the zoo park and seeing all the animals are just amazing thank you all for being a member and supporting our zoo and all our beautiful animals that we have saved. The food could be alil cheaper cause times are very hard for everyone... and we all have more then one child these days. I feel if it was alil cheaper where people would come way more cause its alil more affordable and all that we spend their goes to supporting our animals for sure. We are headed out their today

This is an awesome zoo. The pride of lions are so cool. They have a huge dining area and it oversees the african savannah exhibit . Gotta love being able to feed the giraffes and sting rays. Will definitely be coming back we want to see those zoo lights!<//Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><resp>None</resp><text>Very big zoo. I would go when they open and make a day of it. In my opinion they should stay open longer but because of that if you go when they open and stay all day you should have plenty of time. Everything is open on the weekends but weekdays are just as awesome. The new safari exhibit is huge and wonderful to look at. Diffinitly awesome. Go to the zoo the animals will love you for it.<//text></record>

<Review>Feeding the giraffes, viewing the lion, lioness, & cub,  and the petting zoo animals are my favorite areas! The admissions cost is only $10 to get in, and it's for a good cause. The money you pay to enter is used to maintain the place and keep things running. I especially like the African Safari that was added. The Chafee Zoo has definitely been remodeled for the better.< /Review>< time>

When I was much younger I would not have given this zoo 5 stars. Now, I definitely can. The facility is well maintained, the employees are friendly, and the animals appear to be well taken care of. I have been twice this year so far and I just keep liking it more. I'd definitely recommend heading over and visiting.
As a note: there is some construction going on for a new exhibit, however it will not get in your way during a visit.< /Text>

Alot of construction so less things to see. The African plains is the best, we could sit and watch the animals all day. Definitely a better trip during the week when there is less people. Overall a great outing for the day.<//text>

Truly one must plan on more than a single visit as there are so many areas to visit.
The grounds are well maintained...plenty of clean restrooms. Parking is ample though at peak times, you may have to walk a bit further. There are food options as well as coffee bars for those must have cappuccinos and lattes.
The staff are all very helpful.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>Been a member for 20 years or so. Pays for itself. New African Savana exhibit was and remains a treat. Pride Rock for the lions. Hippos and other animals grazing.sea lion cove is great. Cant say I have a complaint.  Need more great  apes though. Wish they could put the long planned aquarium on same site. Would be a major tourist attraction.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTaYbZAGdgFHF3rZ1MP-e1ODPMxvqxIrdXMwes=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmUYbXvPYdTq2GyZoNRzmAbF4SdrQvVnieUWth=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyQcLGSfAN7zUjv-tnt5MOBiJnIP-jckBg9jcK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZbEMEZgWfCCkm7Y829Fu8g4Hf5YfRAzBQlxVM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOgaD_UKk_IE_OpT0Z-dNM4zGc-C2TJ5TJsMfj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNf0xBqEq3H7CPcTNdiwUtOuYfGxlufErItg2Nc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNroiRN503C5131PrQooX9xxJGYlRAhuREvNtbu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

All the animals were pretty much available to see. Wasn't a whole lots of people either so it felt like we had the place to ourselves. My family enjoyed it and that's all that matters to me💯💯🗣🐒🐆🦏🐘🐠🦕< /text>

I liked it, it was very nice. I especially liked the Elephant exhibit, the animals have ample room to roam. The reptile house was also very AWESOME although I didn't take any pictures this trip, I will next trip, because I'm definitely going back</text>

<text>So I recently decided to take my kids to the zoo. I thought it would be cool for them to see some of the animals that grace our TV screen with their own two eyes. I got to experience the SF zoo and I loved every minute of it. When we got there I instantly loved the realistic layout of every animal's enclosure. The zoo seemed well kept and the animals looked healthy and vibrant. That was until we got to the Tiger. First of all he was pacing back and forth obviously stressed but that I could have overlooked because it's common for some animals to become stressed in captivity. The thing that nipped and pulled at my heart strings was his frail extremely thin stature. He looked severely malnourished and it literally broke my heart to see him in such a state. It really bothered me to show my kids this Tiger (especially since he was one of animals they were looking forward to seeing). I never had a negative thought about animals in zoos but seeing him made it clear what PETA had been preaching all these years. Kind of ruined my perception of the zoo and I don't think I'll be going to the zoo anytime soon. Just my opinion.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<text>Really great zoo! Lots to see and do here. We spent about 5 hours here and STILL didn't see everything, but we were plenty satisfied with everything we did see and do. Besides general admission, you can pay a little extra for a giraffe feeding experience and to touch sting rays. Several animal trainer talks throughout the day at various locations.<//text>< pics>

Petting the stingrays/sharks is by far my favorite part of the zoo, the stingrays are so friendly and cute. The food is decently priced for what you get, and the reusable cups are very nice and eco-friendly by not needing a straw! There are lids that are given to you for the cups when you pay for your food, and there’s a spot for you to drink out of and it does not leak. The petting zoo is always lots of fun and the zookeepers in there are always very informative and friendly when you ask them questions about the animals. The sea lion and seal show is also very cute! The sea lions are adorable and so is the seal, and it’s very informative, teaching kids lots about the pinnipeds they have at the zoo! 10/10 recommend< /text>

What a beautiful zoo! The staff/trainers were extremely knowledgeable and answered all of our questions about the animals. The elephant and white rhino enclosure shown in the first picture is so amazing, it’s like something out of a movie.

All the animals were easy to see and seemed happy in their habitats.

Constantly saw workers doing their best to keep the environment clean and safe.

We even got to see a trainer chat talk about the elephants and show us how they care for them!

We will definitely be going back.</Review>

So much to see now that they've been updating and building new areas. The new water play area is a nice place to cool off but to my 5 year old it makes the zoo more about playing in the water rather than about the animals. But a great addition for those with annual memberships looking for a way to cool off in the summer months.< /text>

<Pics>None< /Pics><text>Zoo is nice. But when it comes to mask wearing and you can't wear one do to medical reasons they don't care. Was told I have to wear one or you can't see certain animals. Well I didn't pay to go there and then be told that. ADA should check them out. If they can't treat everyone the same. Then I'm sorry shut down those areas or make it so people can view them the same. Animals were nice and well taken  care of.</text>< resp>

My kids enjoyed the zoo even though the zoo is under some pretty heavy construction, as a result some of the our favorite zoo exhibits (like the tiger and asian bear) are closed and will be close for a couple years according to zoo employees.</Review>

Really nice & well kept zoo. It's a good size to spend the day but not too big to where you'll need to rush to see it all. Plenty of trees to shade in the hot valley sun/summer. The parking could use some improvements, it's rather small and undefined. Really appreciated the mom's nursing area.</Review>

<Text>This zoo is awesome. I love the Africa exhibit.
The last in the food court wasn't super nice so that's why I gave it 4 stars. But all the employees standing around to answer questions were very knowledgeable and informative.<//Text>< pictures>

The zoo is very clean and organized, where everyone can explore the whole zoo in few hours! Highly recommend visiting Fresno Chaffee Zoo! 👍<//review>< Pics>

Prices are low and worth every penny of the cost to get in. Kids all had a blast. Worth coming to again and again and wish we lived closer to get a membership. The giraffe feeding was awesome.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSg6Sva8lupW8siOh7a1IMu5lISO70HSEqrGuc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMuz156rlUN-ntvzeA46oBDz36K5WjYTE3jeTZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPi2VgWDw4VAYIDbMmrZDgfkKVpnQI9A5fWAEAn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMBVerVOmRMwV2XQxn-4rRsPPHeQOD3mYqJuVy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRGrvLRMCpfXq1VkaPLD-Eaq6nRhS-TM1yeq93=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIUDL8jgWyzSItmG56dK88frA_GT2efSXOSuC-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoz6jEASD_tOH7iuHu8yXlSVxrmDQsvE4YR6IS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXJOmvxZBcSky1uoVKoqI1ZkVsqdOe99HK-EGw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlD80jT_byGY5OGiiCXSBg-1IV4i-hdN3bnS3D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoydZkp2tCiKoumNAyQg4MsUcgayIYJT9pdZZM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Resp>

Overall it is a nice zoo, can be covered in half a day. Need to pay inside for some activities like touching sting ray, seeing dinosaur park, etc. Kids love the dinosaur park, it’s well made.</text>

It is not easy to keep animals in a zoo and still have a natural feel to the show. Fresno Chaffee Zoo does exceedingly well.
Looking at the elephant shaking a palm tree by the water side reminded me of a real wild scene just a couple of miles down from Murchison Falls, Uganda.
Some animals on the resident list were not there, but staff explained the situation.
Great place for a day out!</Text>

<Review>I have seen many zoos in California and Chaffee is still my favorite. The layout is beautiful, there are a wide variety of animals to observe and the food is delicious. There is seating throughout the park. The zoo also offers a variety of kids activities throughout the year. I highly recommend purchasing a membership, especially if you are a Fresno resident. The membership will also get you discounts at other zoos.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOuxMWWdr1Tz-5iTJBjHtZr2o6gjoFWbv9tfMN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6<//Gmap_id></record>

If you haven't been to the zoo or you haven't been in a few years... you gotta check it out. Major improvements have been made.

This is the best thing in Fresno.< /Review>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>It's been ages since I've been to the zoo. It used to be so boring. But, now the experience has been way better than it was then. I like the safari look, how you get to see animals up close, and the zoo keeps have shows of different animals. The old part of the zoo remixed in with the new, more interactions with animals, and good food. Only thing I didn't like was the parking, but overall it was a great experience seeing all the animals in a safari like theme.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwT2Q1GpKHmeUGRPwoqJap1y1Zl_NgpEmCiABR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3RW0BT-DI-7LzHhYO0ev6W62y8OI0VW86ToHw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGSzoJumCSwf7WKIbP1bC0Pgvcqf0dPVhJDFQC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlvxXLyfZGKMbTWE0nF1cnVUpzjKubXIovR9xK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOP7dRfrUyIRjmaWwPBiuQKugZOtj6s7fXH8hRl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObpWVV1RTlYADSooxMB2591dqaCOzMC8OosLTt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4jgvbyKK7osMIJK9Wy3fLsGSOy9V3w-pKX85P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVFQq5oEbb94bAnDxeKmQVLbd_4YdMSfY8EJkq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVwz2yU6U1wHckFp9keYpo4F2WDomrUNUAT6Nz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzf8SYl17J4pjuzPWHf5gb16bbGDDtQOgMUFCc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOPHZ91Pqm8R4jCK-fA_md3FjOsrVF9p4deKG-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiY1qTZ5zPYruLIweOlG5EPGnMqr7HL0dLR9Bi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPByLdbTkRtAHRkqp31lg48IHaf6KaRl5UsbCMg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOixDV1tzb-28HT-_0hM-SK1l43NkqgrF9tG4wY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Resp>

Enjoyed a delicious meal with loved ones while basking in the sunlight as we watched several types of animals in what appears to be something close to their natural habitat. Good times< /review>

<Review>I took my son on a day trip to Fresno yesterday to the Zoo, mall, dinner and movie...Wow they have done so much with this zoo, we loved it super relaxed not crowded beautiful animals and the absolute stars are their zookeepers!! So personal they talk to you and answer any and all questions you have and are the sweetest people.  One also told me they have special areas for kids and adults with special needs and like my son he is autistic with many sensory issues...i am definitely going to try a trip with him next time.  anyway for the kids to calm down after a meltdown or whatever may be bothering them.  What a plus in my book!! The cafe they have there we ate at is right on the African Adventure very yummy food above what i would expect.  You also can sit right there outside and watch the elephants, rhinos, giraffe etc. while you eat such fun!! The animals are superbly taken care of as well...We truly enjoyed our time there and will most definitely be returning and recommending to friends and family.<//Review>< user_id>

<review>The place is well kept. Maintain in manner where the animals doesn't seem to be mis-treated. In a nice loaction next to a park with lake. You and the family can have a picnic and go to the zoo at the same time.< /review><UserId.>118276009618252920205< /UserId.>< rate>

Beautiful and well maintained zoo. Lots of space between exhibits to space yourself away from other families. Several outdoor dinning options, hand sanitizer station easliy available and clean restrooms.   The staff was very friendly and helpful for the most part. We did have a very negative experience at the giraffe feeding. The giraffes themselves where awsome. You can get up close to see them. Where it went wrong was the very rude and unhelpful paid staff. They clearly need more training in customer service. It was not organized and no signs to where you should stand or park your stroller. The hand sanitation was placed after the lettuce pick up area so you had to walk to that point then go back to pick up the lettuce. The staff was barking out orders. A few signs and proper placement of items would have made it easier on everyone. At one point we were the only ones in the pavilion so it was not like the staff had a lot to do. It just needs to be better organized so you know what to do. Otherwise the feeding of the giraffes was interesting. The volunteer staff was great. They specifically explained what we should do and told us about the animals.  Overall the zoo was really fun and a great place to spend the day.<//Text>

We are members of the zoo so we love it. BUT
There is lots of construction right now and the entry into the zoo right now is very disorganized with the current situation.</review>

This was our first visit to the Zoo, I'm 100% happy I brought the stroller for my toddler because it's A LOT of walking and if I had to carry my son around I would have died. It was also super nice they give out free water cups because I got my son a juice but all I wanted was to down some water haha the hands on exhibits like the sting Ray's and giraffes were not pricey at all and my son enjoyed them!!! Can't wait to visit again!< /text>

There was a lot of construction going on that will likely not end any time soon & because of Covid you have to walk down a preset path. The Reptile exhibit is closed and a lot of the animals have been "relocated" to another exhibit that they're working on. Unfortunately those exhibits are all closed so we didn't get to see about a third of the animals.
Overall, it was still a fun experience and the lack of people made for a more enjoyable experience.</Text>

The zoo has improved so much. The animals have much more room for themselves. And for the first who visit now have a beautiful dinning/lounge area in the Africa Adventure section of the zoo.</Text>

<Text>Our latest trip was when they just opened after the Covid-19 closure.  You had to make reservations to go into the park. Adults were encouraged to wear masks. Kids 12 and under did not have to wear masks. The park has signs on the pathways for people to stand and walk.  Overall we had a great time.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Also, word of advice, visit the seals and sea lions last, it's a great place to cool down in the heat and you can see under the water.<//text>< Pictures>

<date>1608066368880< /date><rate>5</rate><review>My family loves the local zoo. It's not as big as sa San Diego Wild Animal park, but you can feed the giraffes and stingrays! It's usually not overly crowded  and its completely possible to see the entire pack, shows included, in a single day. My favorite time of year to go is actually December.  They have an event called Zoolights. The entire park is decked out in Christmas lights, Santa Claus is available for secret sharing and picture taking and there is even FREE hot chocolate handed out during the event! Dont forget to stop by their food shack for some of the best soft pretzels around.  All and all, we love Fresno Chaffee Zoo!</review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6< /Gmap_id></record>

Such a lovely place in Fresno. The animals are cared for well, and the precautions they have taken to keep us the public and animals safe are visable. Thank you.< /text>

<review>Really great place to go for a nice day out with the kids or on a date with your partner. The staff is really friendly and the animals look well taken care of. Make sure to bring sunscreen and lots of water on your visit. The new safari exhibit is really great. Although it can't compete with the San Diego Zoo and Safari park, the Chaffee Zoo is something great that everyone in Fresno should visit every once in a while.<//review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>This zoo is awesome. I love the Africa exhibit.
The last in the food court wasn't super nice so that's why I gave it 4 stars. But all the employees standing around to answer questions were very knowledgeable and informative.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPn_F9f7_PILnTKzcwfhAZ6YGR_klUmq_u_LjrK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_9jWw3BVm8xmRXb1T5mPSe8YG8CCoTHsJYIU4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

Its a great zoo seems like the city should give them more land for a better facility and it felt a little empty since some exhibits were closed and being replaced, but the dinosaur section was great my wife and kids loved it.</Text>

So proud to have this in Fresno. If you are visiting, go now...and take the kids. Price is so reasonable. The new exhibits are breathtaking. Feed the giraffes. Pet the sting rays. Go to the petting zoo. If you're local, send your kids to the summer camps. So glad to see my tax dollars put to great use.
Just go.<//text>

A bit disappointing but didnt expect much otherwise. Pretty much you can only visit outdoor sections due to covid. shame that they make you pay extra for some exhibits, its not that big of a zoo in the first place. the elephant giraffe rhino areas were nice. otherwise wasn't anything overly exciting. The sea lion area seems like a huge section what a waste of space for the 1-2 sea lions hiding swimming in the corner. There was very little or unclear signage of where to go and what to do anywhere in the zoo and they dont even hand you a map when you walk in.< /text>

place was PACKED, parking sucked($5 for parking/entering area) had to walk like 7 minutes to get to zoo area but zoo was fun and we had a blast. African Adventure was pretty cool.  $10 entry fee is not to bad. Go on a weekday less people, more parking space!</review>

Fresno Chaffee Zoo is an awesome place to take the kids and have a relaxing day. There are many animals here to see and you can even put your hands in the water to pet the sharks and stingrays. They also have an area for the kids to get wet and cool down. It is very big so if you want to try and see everything you need to get there early.  I definitely would recommend the Fresno Zoo to others.</Review>

Great zoo. The animal enclosures are big enough. Was really impressed with the indoor Reptile House - which should probably be renamed as reptile and amphibian house or the herp house as it would be more apt to the animals on display. Anyway, rich variety of reptiles and exotic amphibs, mainly frogs. It's a fun area to play "who can spot the animal first".  =)<//Text>

<text>Been almost 10 years since I went to tge zoo and got see all the brand new things they had which were nice! One thing i didnt like was that i saw alot of people not wearing masks and the zoo employees not doing nothing to inforce the rules! Also didnt like how some attractions were closed due to covid and they were still chargin full price! Looking forward to the new attractions in 2021 but wont go untill covid is over with not worth my life!!!</text><pics>None<//pics><rate>3< /rate><Resp>None< /Resp><Date>1606772501753</Date><user_name>Gustavo Vargas<//user_name>< user>

Zoo Boo and Zoo lights are two events my kids look forward to and always ask about! The lines seem really long when you arrive for them, but they move them along quickly. Very friendly, my daughter had a balloon, and they held it at the front for her while we went inside, since it wasn't  allowed inside.

Normally it isn't too crowded on weekdays, and it's a favorite of mine to take my kids on a weekday and enjoy the restaurant next the the African Adventure area... the prices are a little high for the food, but it's still good.< /review>

The area was beautiful and very nice exhibits but you cant take a stroller through the buildings and the extra areas so if you bring kids in a stroller dont expect to see it all.</Review>

<text>Amazing knowledgeable staff & the zoo is just breathtaking! They really did a good job on the zoorassic exhibit & sea lion cove!!! We touched stingrays & got to feed the giraffes & played with goats in the farm animal area. Finished our day with lunch at the lounge which gives a beautiful scenic view of lush African landscape. It was a day not only my granddaughter will cherish but us as well- so glad we became members cause we will definitely be coming back. Thanks so much 😊< /text>< user_name>

A Fresno gem and wonderful family friendly experience. Through Measure Z, the Chaffee Zoo has been able to improve and expand the zoo to make it a quality experience. The new Africa exhibit is really nicely done and the Kopje Lodge has decent food for moderate prices. If you live in the area and have kids or just like having somewhere to go wander I would suggest getting a year pass, it pays for itself in 7 trips. Great place to go for dates without spending a ton of money. Pro tip: If you want to go when it is less crowded, go in to morning. The animals are also more active. During the summer, always go as soon as it opens, before it gets hot.<//Review>

The African exhibit was very nice. The zoo is clean, but the Asian animals side needs a remodel badly and give the asain elephants some more room!!!</review>

Nice little zoo. Lots to see. The animals look well cared for. There are staff/zookeeper talks throughout the zoo where you can witness feedings, learn about them and ask questions. We enjoyed experiencing touching the sting rays and sharks as well as feeding the giraffes. Loved the elephant enclosure, which is mixed with other animals like zebras and rhinos where they have a large area to roam. There's also a splash pad for the kids because it's hot in California!<//review>

It’s a zoo and it has amazing habitats for the animals. You should definitely check this one out. They also added a dinosaur habitat.</Review>

<Review>Great place to go on a date.  Chaffee Zoo is better than I remember when I was a kid.  Kyle Train was relaxing and great places for selfies.  The Park makes a great picnic date.<//Review>< Pics>

Variety of different animals.  Land, air and water. Great food at reasonable prices. Also new exhibits opening soon.  I took my daughter and she loved it, especially the walk thru habitats and of course the monkeys.  I loved how parts of the zoo was separated, as in an Africa exhibit with animals from there same with an Asia, Australian and rainforest sections. I'm posting pictures I wish I got more and better ones like my girl did but.....sorry.  ENJOY< /Text>

<Text>Good local zoo. Especially like the reptilian exhibit. Good eatery with lots of options. We were not local but happened to be traveling and stopped I  Fresno for the day. This is not the San Diego zoo but worth an afternoon. Of fun. The admission is reasonable.</Text><userid>112372392960624277720<//userid>< date>

<Review>It was a pretty warm day in the valley today, but that didn't stop us from visiting the zoo. The only exhibit that was closed was the Reptile House, which I wasn't too sad about (lol don't like snakes). It was exceptionally clean, the staff was super nice and friendly. There were possibly 2 habitats that didn't have animals (sick/injured animal I believe or just being moved). It always brings back memories coming here and I'm glad we came today to support the zoo and see all the wonderful exhibits and animals. Oh and the African Zoofari is AMAZING. Oh and for $3 you can even feed the giraffes 🦒 😊.</Review>< pictures>

The African savannah exhibit is incredible - I’ve never been to a zoo where there’s so much open space for savannah creatures to enjoy with other species. I’ve been on a couple private tours in the reptile hut (family connection and through UCSF wilderness med course) and it gets better and better each time. I’d give 6 stars as you can feed the giraffes for a nominal fee.<//text>

Bought our tickets online and didn't have to line up at the entrance. Zoo is clean, nice place to spend your day with the family.</Text>

During covid, the zoo made changes while still providing an amazing experience. I bring my kids here often and it is always a joy! Come and support this zoo, enjoy the fellowship, and eat the amazing food!< /review>

Well done zoo and displays for this metro area, and great dining area overlooking African savannah  and animals; very friendly staff. Parking bit convoluted, bit of a walk, but only $5.< /text>

This zoo is amazing. Located in a weird part of Fresno but it is always a hit with the kids. Animals and displays are worth every penny. Our family purchases a season pass every year and we go once a month. It is regularly expanding and adding new exhibits, including an amazing Africa exhibit. Food is good but over priced. The extras (Zoo Lights, Zoo Boo, etc) are always fun.< /Text>

It's a great little zoo, they're always trying to find new ways to keep you conning back. The petting zoo is free and the sting ray area only costs $2! It's a great area to bring little ones and the keepers will answer all your random questions about the animals.</Text>

Well done zoo and displays for this metro area, and great dining area overlooking African savannah  and animals; very friendly staff. Parking bit convoluted, bit of a walk, but only $5.< /Text>

The place is well kept. Maintain in manner where the animals doesn't seem to be mis-treated. In a nice loaction next to a park with lake. You and the family can have a picnic and go to the zoo at the same time.< /text>

Its a great zoo seems like the city should give them more land for a better facility and it felt a little empty since some exhibits were closed and being replaced, but the dinosaur section was great my wife and kids loved it.< /text>

<review>First time at this zoo and we went on a whim. Super clean, and was not crowded for a Saturday! The food was surprisingly delicious! And for the cost to get in, the price for our lunch was very decent. My 5 year old loved it and was entertained all day. Definitely coming back!< /review><rate>5</rate>< name>

The best zoo I've been to out of the five in central California/ bay area/ Sacramento.  I've never been that close to the more exotic animals. Really amazing..very clean..prices beat all other zoos..only complaint was it was hard to navigate..even with map..had to retrace steps to missed exhibits.. everyone seemed to be stopping one another to ask where they can find such and such.. I had to bow out last hour from being wiped out.. so plan and rest accordingly.. but hands down WONDERFUL</text>

<Text>A very nice sized zoo to spend the afternoon or even a few hours. Key areas to make sure to visit are the sea lion habitat, ray petting area, feed the giraffes, and walk through the large reptile house. Parking can fill up quickly, so arriving closer to opening may make that easier. Lots of feedings throughout the day along with the shows with different animals make this a recommended zoo to visit.<//Text></record>

The zoo was clean and inviting. Hand sanitizer stations throughout the zoo. All staff was wearing masks in response to the covid19 virus. Gift shops had merchandise outside for purchase. Food was available for outside dining. I look forward to going back.</Review>

<text>Currently many exibits under construction. They have additional charges to get in to see parts of the zoo after you paid at the gate to enter. Gets pricy for families, but great for the kids.</text>< name>

<text>I love this zoo. The exhibits here just get better and better. The African animal exhibit is wonderful. Be sure to go feed a giraffe! Which reminds me, the giraffe handlers were very snarky and rude to me and my family when we last visited. I didn't like our treatment from them. Everyone else was great. If you ever get a chance to go to a special event that allows you behind the scenes, absolutely go for it. I've been in their on site vet clinic and it's great to see the equipment they use.<//text><rate>5< /rate>< username>

<Review>How could you not give this place 5☆. They are constantly renovating and upgrading every corner and nook making it even better than it already is. They offer a little something for every age.  I am married without kids and we go atleast every 6 weeks. They are constantly hosting after hours events introducing the community to something new and exciting,  such as the Roar and Pour a few months back!<//Review>< Pics>

It is so much fun for the kids.  The love feeding the giraffes and petting the stingrays.  They were totally enamored by the baby kangaroo.  The girls also lived all the photo ops with the animals and the statues.  Great food.  Especially the pizza.</review>

Staff did a great job of answering questions and very friendly. There have been a lot of good changes made since last time I was there. The water area it's a great addition. The only issue I had was the overall look. Wasn't as kept up maintenance wise as the last time I was there and I think security should be a little more stringent. For the price, it is a good family experience. If I could give 4 1/2 starts I would.< /Text>

I have not been there in about 25 years. I took my granddaughter. I was shocked. At the pricing schedule parking entrance fee extra charge to see stingrays extra charge to Feed stingrays. Extra charge to feed giraffes I was surprised it was not a charged for the geese and ducks. With someone standing out there selling bread. But my granddaughter had a great time. And I supposed that's all that matters.<//Text>

Awesome experience over all, however I was bummed to pay more for some exhibits after already paying the entry fee. The construction was a bummer too, but I get it has to happen for more exhibits.< /Review>

We just moved from LA to Fresno and this is zoo was a big surprise! It is really huge! It is the fastest-growing zoo in the nation and it has some marine animals like seals and stingrays you can touch, it has an amazing open space for African safari that resembles the San Diego Safari Landscaping where animals roam freely around a beautiful Lake. We fed the giraffes and got to learn so much from zookeepers! We definitely will be back many more times, got the membership which provides a lot of benefits like 10% discounts in the cafe and gift shop and preview events. having been to huge zoos like San Diego Zoo and San Diego Safari in the Los Angeles Zoo, we were surprised beyond our expectation at this beautiful and well-kept Zoo. It has so much to Explore! Oh, before I forget. My kids also spent a good hour digging in the dino dig, it was actually really fun to unearth bone and to get a real feeling of what it would be like being part of it fossil Expedition team.</text>

Love the Fresno zoo, the staff is always amazing and with all the Covid-19 stuff going on right now they are still finding ways to entertain and engage my kids, like with the virtual zoo camp. Definitely recommend supporting the zoo in any way you can.<//Review>

I couldn't find a couple places that i paid for I just got a little sick from the heat . I had to sit down for a min. They should have a couple of staff checking on ppl my age to see if their ok. I couldn't find the exit for a min. there went in circles cause of the way I was feeling. Just suggestion .</text>< date>

Great selection of animals and interactions available. The bird show is must cause they fly around the public and get close to get a better view. Good court has good selection of food as well.< /text>

Worth the time and money to check out this zoo. It’s right off the freeway, and huge parking lot but may need to walk a while to get inside the zoo. It’s located within the Roeding Park so a gate fee is assessed upon entering.  The exhibits are well kept and there are plenty of species to see while you’re here.  The African safari area is very well done and really immerses you in the atmosphere. Be sure to wear comfy walking shoes and bring plenty of water bottles!<//text>

Always fun. Parking sucks but it's a great time once you go in! I love feeding the sting Ray's and options of feeding the giraffes. The food is great and the African side is gorgeous!</text>

<review>Is a pretty place, nice with vegetation everywhere, even enjoyable during hottest days. Fair entance fee for what you can do. They do a fun Bird Show, perfect for the little ones and who loves animals. Birds are gorgeous. You can also feed Jiraffs! 😍 and talk with the animals' keepers about their habitat and characteristics of each animal.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<text>July 13 2019 I took my mom to the zoo for her birthday this morning/afternoon other then the extremely RUDE girls at the giraffe platform we had fun exploring and seeing all the beautiful animals and Dinosaurs. A zookeeper named Brandon who was visiting on his day off was very sweet and helped us find our way around the safari also Misha in the Lion area was amazing and taught us some very cool things about the big cats over all we had fun and hope to return very soon ! Thanks so much for a fun filled afternoon Fresno Chaffee Employees and Partners !</text>< pictures>

Great zoo! The Africa section and tropical bird section were out favorites. Our kids (1 and 6) loved being so close to the animals.  They fed a giraffe and stood within feet of tiny monkeys that weren't behind bars.  Amazing!  I cant wait to come back.</Text>

I love this zoo. The exhibits here just get better and better. The African animal exhibit is wonderful. Be sure to go feed a giraffe! Which reminds me, the giraffe handlers were very snarky and rude to me and my family when we last visited. I didn't like our treatment from them. Everyone else was great. If you ever get a chance to go to a special event that allows you behind the scenes, absolutely go for it. I've been in their on site vet clinic and it's great to see the equipment they use.< /review>

We took our youth girls group, from our church, and they had a blast. The animal exhibits are really cool, and the staff is entirely friendly and helpful. We all loved it!! Thank you, Fresno Chaffee Zoo!! 🐘🐼<//Review>

<Text>Such a beautiful zoo and the new African safari is AHMAZING! A must see. We spend anywhere from 2-4hrs here with our kids. So many new features have been added and the zoo just keeps getting better each year. They’ve even added a water feature. Which living in Fresno is a must.

Our favorite memories are visiting the zoo during the holidays. Lots of fun events to attend. Our most recent was zoo lights!

If you are new to the area or just visiting you need to come check it out!</Text>< Rate>

<rate>5</rate><text>I have a large family so we decided to go with the annual pass which has saved us so much money already. It’s a great buy I suggest anyone who plans on going to the zoo more than once a year should definitely purchase an annual pass. The food is not so pricey. They have been adding more things I personally love going to Stingray bay and they have sharks too. With the annual pass you get into stingray bay free just pay the $1 for feeding if option available. Great place for family outings.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><gmap_id>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6< /gmap_id></record>

Zoo lights was amazing. My first time there and I was so excited to see what it was all about. I was told we were going to see Santa and take pictures, I was excited. As we arrived, there was no parking so we were dropped at he front gates to wait in line. The line moved pretty fast so by the time he parked the car, we were up front.
As you go into the gates, it's all lit up. There were different characters and animals made from lights. Scenes made from cartoons cutouts and those were dressed with lights. It was absolutely beautiful. Sea Lion Cove was equally as beautiful, I dont remember much of what it look liked because I was ambushed by a mob of family and friends....I was proposed to that night, zoo lights will always be special in my heart.  #BerberCoronadoWedding2019</Text>

I didn't think I would enjoy this zoo, I usually end up seeing animals in tiny enclosures that look sad, but all the animals here seem loved and we'll looked after. My two friends an I had a great time! The staff was so nice to us and some asked us questions about Pokémon Go and was just over all really friendly and welcoming. We saw multiple shows in the zoo that were fun and educational, each show took time after to answer questions with the animals and audience. It's nice they let you know what your donation is going toward too. The food is pretty good and really decently priced, we paid like 10$ to feed 3 people and bought the refillable cup. Highly reccomend the member pass for the price. My husband and I will be buying the family pass and returning in future weekends.<//text>

Love, love love Fresno Chaffee Zoo. This oasis just off 99 and Olive (or Belmont) is a real joy to see - repeatedly. As Fresno has grown, the zoo has grown in size, quality, and aesthetics. It's a landmark worthy of being proud of our city. While it is not what I would call inexpensive, it IS a great value for your dollar and should be considered a special biannual or quarterly special treat for the kids (and you). Both exciting AND exhausting, plan for lunch (and rest) at the Kopje Lodge (great food choices), the Safari Cafe, or bring your own picnic. To see the whole zoo requires a LOT of walking so try to plan your visit where you land at food/rest at appropriate times. Highly recommend.< /text>

Best place for the whole family year round!! The animals are all healthy and well cared for. The grounds are kept clean and free of hazards! Super easy to push our stroller wherever needed! Great hands on kid areas for our 2 year old. Been coming here for years and they just keep improving! 10/10 would recommend< /Text>

They didn't have very many animals. The elephants were to far away to see trying to get into there enclosure. My favorite part was the dinosaur exhibit. I made my brother take pics with all of the dinosaurs. Lol< /Review>

Always enjoy my time here. Only reason I didnt give 5 stars is the restrooms do need some TLC. Rust and paint chips everywhere. But everything else is an awesome experience!< /Text>

<Review>Such a beautiful zoo and the new African safari is AHMAZING! A must see. We spend anywhere from 2-4hrs here with our kids. So many new features have been added and the zoo just keeps getting better each year. They’ve even added a water feature. Which living in Fresno is a must.

Our favorite memories are visiting the zoo during the holidays. Lots of fun events to attend. Our most recent was zoo lights!

If you are new to the area or just visiting you need to come check it out!< /Review>< Date>

While the entrance is not fancy you quickly find out it drops you directly into the action. I beautiful walk through tropical bird environment that thrills children and adults alike. Moving on to the elephants you are sill thinking this is a standard zoo adventure until you come out on the Savanna. 40 acres of beautiful environment designed so well you don't notice the barriers between the hunters and the prey. Off in the distance a herd of elephants sways while different antelope types wander and occasionally bound through. A pride of lions sits to one side. Lounging on rocks and lording it over all, cubs playing and lionesses watching over them. A rhinoceros wanders through with her baby at her side. Amazing everyone. Next is on to the giant enclosed tropical rain forest complete with waterfall and fowl of all types. The zoo in Fresno is well worth the visit. If you in town at loose ends or looking for something on the weekend to do with yourself or the family. You can't lose with this one.<//text>

Brought my Family from the Bay Area to checkout this Zoo and they loved it so much. The Fresno Chaffee Zoo has improved so much over the years its mind blowing, the African animal Exhibit is the masterpiece that this Zoo needed and finally got. I Definitely recommend visiting The Fresno Chaffee Zoo if you’re new to town.</Text>

The zoo was clean and inviting. Hand sanitizer stations throughout the zoo. All staff was wearing masks in response to the covid19 virus. Gift shops had merchandise outside for purchase. Food was available for outside dining. I look forward to going back.</text>

Prices were not horrible, but you do have to pay extra for certain exhibits. 1/4 of the exhibits are closed.<//Text>

They don't really have a big selection of animals to look at.We couldn't see a good hand full of them because the animals weren't let out or the animals spaces were being cleaned. Food and items are pricey as expected in any park. What I didn't expect is to pay for a second admission just to see the dinosaur exhibit inside the same park. And most of the staff were nice that is until I got to the seal training. The lady that talks through the hole show was genuinely bothered that my 3 year old was walking around while she was talking. So once he tossed a water bottle to my niece. She was like"don't throw objects and have a seat bud. It's distracting to everyone." But she was the only one who seemed distracted by it. But what she had said wasn't the problem the true problem was she rolled her eyes and shook her head as in disbelief that a 3 year can't sit still. Hello it's a zoo were people take their kids to see animals my 3 year old son is not the first nor the last child that won't be able to sit still. I just think if your going to work where there's kids you just have learn to work though it and be patient.<//Text>

What an amazing job Chaffee has been doing in creating beautiful, natural looking spaces. And as usual, it's wonderful to see some of these creatures... a poor man's photo Safari... that otherwise one can only see on screens or pages. Add to that the knowledge shared by the docents and other zoo staff and it makes an amazing outing. And to top it all off, the work done by zoos saving the last survivors of some species is invaluable.< /text>

<Text>You got to have more training & shows going on than just The Bird Show all the time that's the same old thing I seen since I was young and what happened to all of those little guide boxes/digital educational boxes throughout the park. Yeah, they would read to you the information and give you a lot of cool info & details about the animals. I think for the most part that if y'all get a tiger show going on it would be awesome & attract more people from out of state & around-the-world even!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Love the cafe there that overlooks the African exhibit. My 2 year old son had so much fun feeding the elephants. Highly recommend. Not 5 stars because there weren't really any kiddie rides or activities.<//review>

One of the best zoos I've ever been too. Exhibits are setup perfect, animals seem happy and active, and they are easy to view. My kids love to go just to go dig for dinosaur bones and play in the splash park. My personal favorite is the eating area in the Africa exhibit.<//Review>

This is a great family place! There are so many things to do and see. Even when the place is "crowded" there is still room to move around see the exhibits. So glad that Measure Z has endured and brought so many great changes to Fresno Chaffee Zoo!</review>

Their bright yellow and bluish/purplish colors were so beautiful. We also had a fun time feeding the giraffe and petting the goats. The place was clean and the personnel were friendly and helpful. The walk around the park was very pleasant and enjoyable. The weather was temperate that added more to trees that abundantly inhabited the place.</Text>< userid>

<Text>Fresno Zoo is the perfect zoo. Not too big where it takes up your whole day, but certainly not a small zoo either. It has all the major animals that the kids want to see and it's still improving. Not to mention the great food and retail shops!</Text>< Response>

I have lived in Fresno all my life and watched the Roeding Park Zoo transform into the Chaffee Zoo. This is a zoo the people of Fresno can be proud of. I hadn't been in a few years and was amazed at how big the Zoo has gotten. The exhibits are spacious and there's lots of spots to sit in the shade. Parking is free and limited close to the entrance. You might have to walk a bit from where you park to get in during the weekends. But worth it.<//Text>

It's great! Plenty of animals such as elephants, rhinos, tortoises, cheetahs and more. 2 places to eat inside. I've only stopped by the cafe which isn't overly pricey for a quick snack. Love that at $12 a person it's still affordable for us locals and of course the expansions are great!< /review>

<Review>Prices needs to be better esp for those whom live here in town... I would say make it affordable for the town and it would help out the zoo with funds for those animals... Its cheaper in L.A zoo at times...which is why people go more there...<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I lived in San Diego (the world famous zoo) for a long spell, and even with that, I was still very pleased with Fresno's zoo. Many vivid colored animals I'd not seen before and such fun watching monkeys swing and carry the young ones. For eats, gluten free vegetarians can get a salad...but little else at the cafe near the safari. Nice way to spend a few hours.< /text>

<Name>Sue Harrison< /Name><time>1559176977950< /time><Rating>5</Rating><text>Awesome zoo for a small City like Fresno. Awesome zoo. They are constantly trying to make it a better place for the animals and a super experience for the public. Tickets aren't too bad, but if you want to go back more than once a year it really pays to get a membership! Then you can go as often as you please and you get discounts in the gift stores and I think even on food, but don't hold me to the food. There is so much to see and experience and learn! Special places for kids and lots of benches to just sit and enjoy. If you like animals you have to check this place out!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<review>Great zoo! The Africa section and tropical bird section were out favorites. Our kids (1 and 6) loved being so close to the animals.  They fed a giraffe and stood within feet of tiny monkeys that weren't behind bars.  Amazing!  I cant wait to come back.<//review>< Gmap_id>

<text>Never been more disappointed.  I haven't left my home since March 20th due to the coronavirus quarantine, and I did today to go to the zoo!  Before I arrived I was under the impression that anyone over the age of 12 would be required to wear a face mask while there.  Once I entered the gates to the zoo it was quite a surprise when over 95% of the people in the zoo had no face mask what so ever, and it was not being enforced.  In fact, even some of the staff of the zoo had masks on yet were pulled down under their chins.  The fact that the Fresno Chaffee Zoo would encourage large groups of people to gather, with children, without any sort of protection during the time of a pandemic  is quite shocking to me and makes me question whether or not i should continue to support them financially.   They are willing to accept peoples money, and potentially risks hundreds of peoples of lives when all they had to do was enforce a mask police.  If Costco can do it, why can't they?  For me, I will be seeing about getting a refund on my membership, I don't want to fund a zoo that only worries about the dollars and not about its patrons.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

< Review>
I think this zoo is so well designed, it is one of the best zoos I've been too, even if it's a little on the smaller side. The African Savannah section is sooo well done! You feel like you're on a safari! The restaurant in that section is also really reasonably priced, and I love the garlic fries. Other highlights for me are the kangaroo walk, the stingray petting and feeding, and the rainforest walkthrough. Oh, and the sea lions are great as well. This is a zoo that I want to keep coming back to.<//Review>

So much fun! I hadn't been to this zoo in 10 years and so much has changed.  They have done some amazing improvements and additions. It is very affordable and a great time for all ages.  The exhibits are all well done and you can easily view the animals.  There are also two great locations to eat delicious food at affordable prices.< /Review>

<review>Came here with my family on an off day. It was an awesome trip to this zoo! They have a good variety of animals and reptiles. Animals look well taken care of. Admission, parking, and even food are of reasonable cost. My toddler son really enjoyed seeing reptiles, orangutans, elephants, and rhinos. He also had a blast in the Dino Dig area. Was a great experience and will come back. Some friends say it's the best zoo around(better than Oakland and SF).

As for the negatives reviews below.
1. Prices. This place is NOT that expensive 😂. Money goes to caring for the animals and employees. If PRICES are an issue then go park or stay home
2. Animals. Many of these animals are endangered or wouldn't last in the wild. They are well taken care of and in a clean environment.
3. Parking. Parking DOES stink!! I agree on that but arrive early then.< /review>< Rate>

ZooBoo (19 OCT 2019 // I arrived at 4pm to about 8pm)
Would not recommend. Would not go again.
I didn't know what to expect at first. My impression was hopeful them dreadful. None of the animals were out. My group of kids literally got 3 pieces of candy in total. Some areas had huge lines. Some places didn’t give candy but rather coupons. Very little decorations for Halloween theme.<//Text>

Amazing zoo.  If you haven't seen the new African exibit, then you need to go back to the zoo and check it out.  You can get a close look at leopards, lions, and tigers. You can feed a giraffe, and walk around with kangaroos. It is an amazing zoo experience where the animals have a great environment to live in.< /review>

<Review>I have gone to the Fresno Chaffee Zoo since I started college in the early seventies and seen how it has grown and improved into one of the best Zoos to visit. Our family has been members since my children were born and now it is a favorite family event with my grandchildren.  When I was young, the San Diego Zoo was a frequent event so I grew up loving the experience. The Fresno Chaffee Zoo is easier to experience in a day and an extremely memorable experience with special events and exhibits throughout the year. It's well worth visiting.

Visiting Zoos elsewhere in the Nation is something we have done over the years so I have seen some wonderful ones elsewhere, like Atlanta, Georgia and Portland. Each one has unique things and this Zoo does as well.<//Review>< Date>

Best place in Fresno. I have been going here ever since I could get in for free. I am so glad it is always doing new things, it really has come a long way since I was young, and I am very excited for what the future has to hold for the Fresno chaffee zoo. I am for sure going to always be comeing back for more, for years and years to come.<//Text>

Chaffee is a great zoo, however, I was very disappointed after getting there only to go d out that about half their zoo was empty due to creating new exhibits for the future.< /Review>

<text>Great Dino exhibit! Feeding the giraffes was so fun and my kids had the best time. We wrapped up the day at the splash pad. We come here often and appreciate all the work they are putting into this zoo. We loved it and it’s our favorite zoo. Not too small but not too overwhelming like other zoos. Can’t wait to be back !!<//text>< gmap_id>

One of the best places to go with the kids in Fresno. The African area is pretty amazing.... Even better than some high city zoos I've been to.</Text>

<Review>It's been a while since my last visit to the zoo. While fun, it's not exactly something I would get excited about. I was completely amazed by the huge improvements they've made there. The Africa exhibit is spectacular and getting a chance to feed the giraffes was super cool. Was not expecting anything close to this level especially here in Fresno. They did a great job on their food concessions too. Great variety and really good too. Again something I wasn't expecting and now a viable lunch/dinner option for the family. If you haven't been here in a while, check it out and prepare to be wowed.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Chaffee Zoo is one of the greatest family spots in Fresno. Good for everyone or even for an afternoon date. Even on a weekend day, it isn't unreasonably packed.<//review>

< Review>
July the 3rd, Friday, 2020....as the morning sun rose in the east, the Fresno Chaffee Zoo was ready for the visitors of the day.  Even though the Covid-19 cloud hung over Fresno County, the zoo was well prepared for this problem.  The animals didn't seem to mind that the people observing them had on masks and werepracticing social distancing.  They were content with their food and well maintained enclosures.  For the observing humans, there were plenty of hand sanitizer stations found across the grounds of the zoo. Granted the zoo had to close a few of the enclosed exhibits because of the "19" mandates, but the personal of the zoo had great presence and we think there were smiles beneath their masks.  Questions were always answered, and often you came away with more information then your question was asked about.  The zoo has come a long way since this person visited it when Nosey was still in her enclosure. So if you have not seen the Chaffee Zoo in 10 years or more, take some time out of your schedule, and if necessary,  put on a mask and stroll through a wonderful zoo. Hopefully in a few months the mask will not be necessary.  Enjoy...</Review>

<Review>Sea lion cove is amazing. The newest Jurassic exhibit is super cool. Can't wait for the Asian exhibit, it's going to solve the problem of hardly being able to see the tigers. Oh, and feeding stingrays is something you gotta try, feels like a slimy, kinda prickly vacuum sliding over your hand very gently... It's weird for sure, but so fun to have them glide through the water, slurp up the food and keep on it's way.</Review>< pictures>

Fresno Chaffee is always a great time for me and my family. They are continually improving, adjusting exhibits, adding animals and experiences, so that each visit has a good mix of familiar and new. It's great any time of the year. The food is a little overpriced, but you expect that. The animals are clearly week taken care of, and conservation is important to the entire operation.< /Text>

This is a great zoo! Our favorite parts are feeding giraffes and petting stingrays. Giraffe feeding is a couple of dollars and petting stingrays is a bit more but you can get in for free with annual passes. You do pay for parking but it's only about $5. Get there right when it opens for a great spot. There are tons of great features and you definitely won't see everything in one day. Bring water and snacks for sure. Sunscreen up to. There are some places that aren't shady!</text>

My favorite zoo in California. Not too big (if you've got little ones) but not too small (you do get your $$$ worth). Can't wait to come back in 2021 when they add even more stuff.<//Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>One of the best zoos I've been to.  Very crowded today as it was a school holiday but the parking lot full was a clue to how much people here love their zoo and for good reason.  Clean and well staffed.  The exhibits tend to the open and expansive almost as if one were not in a zoo at all.  The Africa display was particularly impressive.

It's worth an extra day even if your ultimate destination is Yosemite -- yes I think it's that good.<//Text>< Pics>

We have a family membership and it has been a great value. We have a great Zoo which is only getting better. Recently too some family who were visiting from Hawaii and they had a great time and were extremely impressed with the Zoo they want to make it a regular activity when they fly over. I went to the Zoo as a child and am very proud of the improvements they have made locally to the Zoo as well as the conservation efforts they are now a part of.<//Text>

<rate>3</rate><review>The zoo experience was great!!! The animals are awesome. Customer service was good and food/drink prices were competitive to similar attractions. Prices of the tickets was fair. However... It took an hour to pay and find a parking spot! Absolutely ridiculous, they really need to address this issue. Fix the parking issue and you get 4 stars.< /review>< pics>

It was nice, although a lot of the animals were asleep. A little pricey on the food. But customer service was good. Plan on good my back soon.</Text>

Families favorite zoo! Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys wildlife. They are undergoing some construction for more exhibits, but there is still plenty to do and see! Our favorite exhibit is the stingray pool! Pet huge rays and sharks! Can't wait to see what is in store for the new exhibits!</review>

<Text>It always seems to be hot when I go, but I always find that it is all worth it. I’m really glad to see that they are expanding many parts of the zoo for larger exhibits. There’s also a baby rhino and a baby orangutan that made me feel again.
Kangaroos are still superior<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<Text>So fun and so much to see. Park rangers all around to answer any questions. Prices are very good. Where we are wasn't ridiculously overpriced. I was very pleasantly surprised. Drive up from Gilroy to take our 3 year old grandson who had a blast!!

Kids always love it. Love that they are always adding to it also- totally worth the extra in taxes. Cheap annual pass ($90 a year for our family as fresno county residents) The new mini water park/play area is a HUGE hit with the kids for our sweltering summers. There can be a shortage of tables for the parents to sit while the kids play so get there early if possible</review>

My personal tour of the zoo was so informative because of the excellent information provided by the volunteer docent Linda Franklin. I have been to zoo's across America, but have never been so informed about the animals and the behind the scenes activities and care that must take place for the animals to remain healthy and active. A wonderful experience made all the better thanks to Linda. Be sure to spend a day, or two, when in Fresno, Ca.</Text>

Being born and raised in Fresno I have been going to the Fresno Chaffee Zoo for years. It is so nice to see how it has evolved. There are so many wonderful attractions. Stingray Bay where you can actually pet a stingray. The seal exhibit that allows you to not only watch the seals and sea lions frolic and jump out of the water you can walk down to the underwater level and watch them swimming. The African Adventure was so well done. It is expansive with lots of room for the animals to roam.</text>

<name>Moe Money</name><date>1581387276281< /date><Rate>5</Rate><review>Hands down the best zoo on the west coast! From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave a jungle based nature is present. My god kids love this place. The amount of exotic animals present is surreal. The pictures don’t even scratch the surface on how awesome this zoo really is. I love the detail placed here. The kids had a blast, but I can say I might’ve enjoyed the experience just as much.

Feeding the animals was a large part of our day. They are so friendly. The staff is very aware and alert. They know the animals so well. I was very pleased with the pictures I was able to get with the animals so close. Feeding the animals really creates the want to feed yourself. The food spots spread out across the zoo does the tummy right. They have proper meals for both adults and children.

A must see is the giraffes. The line to view them was amazing. They really capture the attention of everyone. Money very well spent for a full day at the zoo with the little ones. Will certainly return in the near future to stay informed on new additions to the zoo family.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<review>By far the best zoo I've been to. If you go shortly after opening, there is hardly anyone there and the weather is awesome. Definitely better than the LA and Indianapolis zoos. it always had a very reasonable price to get in.</review></record>

<Text>Seems they are renovating or adding new stuff. One or two exhibits are closed, a few others are detoured a bit, but nothing unbearable. My son is the best tour guide I could ask for. I recommend buying the family pass as it pays for itself in just 2 or 3 visits. It's nice to be able to run over after school for an hour to kill time and not have to pay admission for such a short time frame.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I love our zoo! We're so lucky to have this in our area. It's always a great day when we come here. We love the new wilderness falls and the African safari area too. The new kangaroo walkabout lets you really get up close and personal with the kangaroos! It's a learning adventure every single time.< /Text>

So much fun to see the animals.  It's great how they have workers periodically throughout the Zoo to explain the animals nature and habitat.  A learning experience for the kids and some Adults. My granddaughter wants to work with animals and that just peaked her interest even more. Great job Chaffee Zoo.< /review>

<Text>Great place to take the kid for a couple of hours.  I've always had membership to any zoo in a city I've lived.  I'm used to San Diego zoo so this zoo doesn't compare but always nice to have zoo nearby and I'm glad to have Fresno zoo nearby.< /Text><user>116996984299553223977</user>< gmap_id>

In all my adult life I've never been to a zoo and i had so much fun! I love cats so I especially enjoyed seeing the "big cats" ! Watching the handler talk, discuss and train with the tiger was amazing!< /review>

The dinosaur experience is amazing and so lifelike. We went to my nieces birthday party because she loves dinosaurs. They have a whole party area set up with a mini dinosaurs dig, dinosaurs as decorations. The works. You even get to walk through the Jurassic area with the dinosaurs and they move. Scared the bejesus out of my 2 year old. It was so much fun.<//Text>

I always love visiting here! I take my kids, but go for myself as well. Great place to eat too. Many restrooms which is nice. You can ask anyone about pretty much anything and get an answer. The bird show is awesome.  The petting zoo is great too. There is really a place for ALL AGES to enjoy. They even have a water feature area for little ones. I have kids ages 2, 12 and 15. ALL love going.< /review>

The flamingos and the rhinos are my favorites. The flamingos for their delicateness as well as their color; the rhinos for their thickness as well as their practical lack of color. Wonderful zoo.< /text>

Adding poles and extending the shade covers over the walkways.  It gets so hot and I've seen numerous people get drained by the amount of direct sunlight in this area.  Just a thought to help their guests last longer throughout their zoo experience.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6<//Gmap_id>< rate>

< Review>
Fresno Chaffee Zoo has improved over the years and I love the beautiful grounds and fun stingray pool that the kiddos can play and interact with. I am so happy that there have been so many wonderful renovations because I remember going to the zoo over 40 years ago as a child and it's nice to see it has improved over time unlike so many other childhood memories that are now long gone. Enjoy.< /Review>

The Wizard of Oz theme for the children's breakfast & meet greet and take pictures with Dorothy & the rest of the characters was cool, and my granddaughter had a fun time. Plan on coming next month, different theme every month, I RECOMMEND it.</text>

Absolutely loved this zoo. Lots of animals , well maintained and friendly zoo keepers. Plan out coming early because they won't let you in after 4:30pm. Enjoy the food and watch Elephants and giraffes and many such animals.</text>

Such a beautiful & impressive zoo for its size! Where else can you eat lunch and watch animals such as rhinos & elephants graze on the horizon? Zoo is very interactive, and if you have kids there are some nice play areas for them. This zoo never feels too crowded- it’s very spacious & well mapped out.  Staff is always friendly & helpful. Parking is easy. Entry fee is very affordable.  This zoo is truly a hidden gem in the Central Valley!!< /Text>

Being born and raised in Fresno I have been going to the Fresno Chaffee Zoo for years. It is so nice to see how it has evolved. There are so many wonderful attractions. Stingray Bay where you can actually pet a stingray. The seal exhibit that allows you to not only watch the seals and sea lions frolic and jump out of the water you can walk down to the underwater level and watch them swimming. The African Adventure was so well done. It is expansive with lots of room for the animals to roam.</text>

Can't wait for the Asian exhibit, it's going to solve the problem of hardly being able to see the tigers. Oh, and feeding stingrays is something you gotta try, feels like a slimy, kinda prickly vacuum sliding over your hand very gently... It's weird for sure, but so fun to have them glide through the water, slurp up the food and keep on it's way.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Chaffee is a great zoo, however, I was very disappointed after getting there only to go d out that about half their zoo was empty due to creating new exhibits for the future.<//Text>

My personal tour of the zoo was so informative because of the excellent information provided by the volunteer docent Linda Franklin. I have been to zoo's across America, but have never been so informed about the animals and the behind the scenes activities and care that must take place for the animals to remain healthy and active. A wonderful experience made all the better thanks to Linda. Be sure to spend a day, or two, when in Fresno, Ca.<//Text>

Amazing zoo! Almost every habitat had a very knowledgeable intern available to answer any questions. The exhibits allow for great movement and guest visibility of the animals. The number of bathrooms and water fountains are amazing. You are never more than a short walk from either item. Most importantly is the cost. The admission cost is very low. You get a great, all day value at this zoo. The food, also, is very reasonable. Personal pizza for 8$? Yep, and it was very good. $2 bottle sodas. The mac and cheese was the highlight of lunch though. Amazing!</text>

<review>We had a fantastic time! Zoo keepers where extremely nice, helpful, and provided good information. Loved the birdshow, feeding the giraffes, petting the stingrays, and the zoorasice park was awesome. It was so cool to hear the dinosaurs and see them. The the kopje lodge had some awesome food! It was a little pricey but good. I got a turkey wrap and the kids got a personal size pizza. The wrap had some amazing flavor. The kids loved the pizza and actually ate it all. Over all a great experience and will be back.<//review>< pictures>

I've had so much fun here, this is such a deal considering the price of admission! Feeding a giraffe was a great experience and I appreciate that they allow the giraffes to decide if they want to interact with people. Beers were kind of pricey but were worth it considering the views (which include a baby rhino). Heck of a deal, highly recommend.</review><rating>5< /rating>< time>

<review>Very pleasantly surprised!! We live in southern California and are are members of the San Diego zoo and Safari park. They are both incredible but, the experience here at the Fresno zoo was one we will never forget! The up close animal encounters were so amazing... Feeding the giraffes, petting the stingrays, standing 2 feet away from the sloths while the keeper hand feed them... All amazing experience that we never get in San Diego and for just a fraction of the entrance price! The staff was incredible, the crowds were few, and we will return next time we are in Fresno!<//review>< Pics>

<review>This is a great zoo! Our favorite parts are feeding giraffes and petting stingrays. Giraffe feeding is a couple of dollars and petting stingrays is a bit more but you can get in for free with annual passes. You do pay for parking but it's only about $5. Get there right when it opens for a great spot. There are tons of great features and you definitely won't see everything in one day. Bring water and snacks for sure. Sunscreen up to. There are some places that aren't shady!< /review>< user_name>

<Text>Being born and raised in Fresno I have been going to the Fresno Chaffee Zoo for years. It is so nice to see how it has evolved. There are so many wonderful attractions. Stingray Bay where you can actually pet a stingray. The seal exhibit that allows you to not only watch the seals and sea lions frolic and jump out of the water you can walk down to the underwater level and watch them swimming. The African Adventure was so well done. It is expansive with lots of room for the animals to roam.< /Text>< Rating>

Fresno Chaffee is always a great time for me and my family. They are continually improving, adjusting exhibits, adding animals and experiences, so that each visit has a good mix of familiar and new. It's great any time of the year. The food is a little overpriced, but you expect that. The animals are clearly week taken care of, and conservation is important to the entire operation.<//Text>

So fun and so much to see. Park rangers all around to answer any questions. Prices are very good. Where we are wasn't ridiculously overpriced. I was very pleasantly surprised. Drive up from Gilroy to take our 3 year old grandson who had a blast!! The reptile house and of course the dinosaurs!!</review>

<time>1542075098246</time><rating>5</rating><text>One of the best zoos I've been to.  Very crowded today as it was a school holiday but the parking lot full was a clue to how much people here love their zoo and for good reason.  Clean and well staffed.  The exhibits tend to the open and expansive almost as if one were not in a zoo at all.  The Africa display was particularly impressive.

It's worth an extra day even if your ultimate destination is Yosemite -- yes I think it's that good.<//text>< pics>

Seems they are renovating or adding new stuff. One or two exhibits are closed, a few others are detoured a bit, but nothing unbearable. My son is the best tour guide I could ask for. I recommend buying the family pass as it pays for itself in just 2 or 3 visits. It's nice to be able to run over after school for an hour to kill time and not have to pay admission for such a short time frame.< /text>

<Text>I literally was so surprised at what a great zoo this is! The animals were all out, great exhibits, clean facilities, wonderful staff! We spent 4 hours there and enjoyed every minute. We only had ice cream but even that was delicious. Only downer is the people whose children don't behave... screaming, tapping glass, littering, climbing, etc. Please control your children... you're supposed to go see the animals at the zoo, not bring yours.</Text>< pics>

<review>Lots of wheelchair or stroller access.  The Jurassic section was AWESOME!  We paid for the whole experience and fed manta rays - coolest thing ever, and fed giraffes as well, it was tons of fun.  If going in summer, take a hat and go early.< /review></record>

<userid>114355828613265443471< /userid><text>Fantastic zoo!
Our family visited Chaffee Zoo in November 2016. Even though the review was high, I didn't have too much expectations, but we were all surprised how wonderful this zoo was. Habor seals were plafull in a beautifully desighed pool. They were so amusing to watch, we could have watched them 30 more minutes. In African grassland section,  2 rino were walking and eating peacefully.  We had relaxing lunch while looking over African grassland area. Try their local OJ sold at the cafe. It was very tasty. Overall, 4 of us had fantastic time here. We will happily visit again when we are in Fresno.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I've been all over the country and this is one of the best zoos I've ever been to. The park is clean, the animals are happy and cared for, and there are always helpful employees and volunteers nearby. This place is a good way to use up two to three hours, even if your family is familiar with the zoo. Just be prepared for the lion exhibit if you're bringing small children; there is a retired range rover there, and they will fight you to the death to stay with that truck.</review>

Always clean
Big enough to walk with room around you.
Places to sit in the shade.
Feed the Giraffe.
Always building more space for the animals.

I've never been unhappy

Very impressed by the change that they have made, how beautiful it has become and how wonderful the staff were! They had giraffe feedings and stingray feedings. We took great pix and spent at little over 2 hrs there without getting to see the reptile home.< /Review>

We live in Bakersfield so we dont really live to close to any real big zoo's, so being able to go to Fresno and see the Chaffe Zoo was amazing. My little 14 month old loved seeing the seals from the underwater view room. She was a bit scared feeding the Giraffe but once mom and dad did it she was ok with it. It was such a beautiful day for our family. Thank you so much.< /text>

<time>1536379884519< /time><Rating>5< /Rating><Text>This is an amazing zoo. I, like many others, grew up when it was slightly shabby and perpetually struggling until the early 2000s; now, it is THE jewel of the Central Valley. With exhibits in both Spanish and English, a cheap entry fare, and an intimate setting coupled with the gorgeous Safari half, the Chaffee Zoo is absolutely the star of any casual tour of Fresno.

If you are a resident, purchase the yearly membership -- it more than pays for itself if you visit more than twice a year. The community and heart behind it is bigger than any nationally-recognized zoo.<//Text>< pics>

Not expensive to enter. Best part is they let you feed the giraffes for $3. The food in the cafe was delish and tons of food to choose from. No bears but lots of other animals to see.</review>

<Text>Really another dead elephant. I thought it was meant to be better now? Shut down the large exhibits that house animals in inadequate conditions. Keep only animals the zoo is able to properly care for and allow them to live more like their natural habitat.<//Text><Rate>2</Rate>< Name>

The Fresno Chaffee Zoo is a beautiful, well-maintained property with a wide range of animals and educational programs. The animal enclosures are designed to replicate their natural habitats and they look well and happy. (See the giraffes smile!) a visit to the zoo is highly recommended.</Review>

My family and i LOVE the Fresno Chaffee Zoo! It's so cheap! We can enjoy ourselves for about $40 For a family of 4. The only things we dislike about the zoo is the location, the parking and paying to park. Other than those things, the zoo is fantastic. It transports you to another world away from the bustling city life. It's so peaceful and clean. We absolutely love it!<//Text>

Good for a weekend/family outing.< /Review>

So far I like it more than any zoo I've been to. It is very big and has some beautiful scenery for the animals. The habitats are huge and the animals have room to roam. A wide variety of animals too. There are open areas that little monkeys can jump all around you and get inches from you. Walking through the aviaries is great as well. Definitely better than the LA zoo and Santa Barbara zoo. Animals seem more lively as well.</Text>

Great place to take my Kids even for a simple 'get out the house' day. They get to run around and enjoy learning about the animals. The water area is smaller than I thought but it'll cool you off for your walk. Glad we decided to become Members. Would highly recommend that.<//review>

We loved that all the animals were relatively easy to see too. The zoo is fairly small compared to other zoos I've visited, but it really is a great place to visit.< /review><user_name>Mariah Sheffield Wood< /user_name>< Resp>

Probably the least impressive zoo I have been to, but it is something to do in the valley.< /review>

I came on a field trip with my brother's school and there were only a few animals out. It might have been because we came in the afternoon and it was pretty hot. There were many different animals that I do not remember being here which was very neat. The highlight of my trip was being able to feed the giraffes.</review>

<Review>Lots of wheelchair or stroller access.  The Jurassic section was AWESOME!  We paid for the whole experience and fed manta rays - coolest thing ever, and fed giraffes as well, it was tons of fun.

I literally was so surprised at what a great zoo this is! The animals were all out, great exhibits, clean facilities, wonderful staff! We spent 4 hours there and enjoyed every minute. We only had ice cream but even that was delicious. Only downer is the people whose children don't behave... screaming, tapping glass, littering, climbing, etc. Please control your children... you're supposed to go see the animals at the zoo, not bring yours.</review>

<Review>Unique experience- well designed and executed. Food for humans has variety and great taste. Get there early on the weekend because it is a destination for families with young children and rightly so. The Fresno Chaffee Zoo has a rare gem on its hands, one we can all take pride in.< /Review>< rate>

A diamond in the rough of the big city. Improvements to animal habitats over the years is a plus. Zookeepers have great passion and respect for animals. Dino animatronics is a site to behold. Must see if you are a child of adventure age 1-100!< /Review>

My family was so.impressed in how perfessional and kind the staff were .. they answered all of our questions and helped us understand the beauty of nature .. over all it was just a great experience!  5 stars all the way< /text>

<Text>Visited this zoo this year with my kids. We Loved it! We went on a Saturday and it did get busy but we still had a good time. It does get less packed during the weekday. The paths are smooth for strollers, restrooms were clean, the park was clean. No graffiti or trash laying around. A lot of educational areas and the Safari area is really cool! There's a restaurant right by it so you can eat and see the animals. My kids loved it. Petting the stingrays is a must! It's really cool and feeding the giraffes too! Will be returning!</Text><rate>5< /rate><Date>1501308365656< /Date><name>rosa armstrong<//name>< Response>

Great for children's Field trips. Employees were nice and patient! Loved how clean it was and the food was great! It was so much fun feeding the giraffes and petting the stingrays at Stingray Bay! I can see why people have family passes and go back again and again.<//Text>

We buy the one year pass. Good price. Lots of fun family events throughout the year. And they keep building new additions to the zoo. I wish some of the animals had more roaming space. But overall..my kiddos always enjoy a visit to the zoo!</Review>

The zoo is nice.  The bird show was funny.  The kangaroo area is great.  The African area has an open feel to it.  My kids loved feeding giraffes, Ray's, alpacas, and goats.  It is not huge, but very well designed.  My kids really liked the rope bridge in the tropical bird area.  It was a great visit.< /Text>

We've been going to this Zoo for the.past 13 years and have made it a grandkids,and their parents family tradition.  My husband and I love it. The grandkids love it. Fresno chaffee zoo is so awesome.  I wish to thank the staff and the care takers for giving us the memories, that we've had for all these years.<//text>

Had a great visit. All of the staff were very friendly and informative. The elephants were replaced by rhinos. One died and the other is happy down in San Diego. She even has a boyfriend! A zoo guide showed us pictures on his phone. It was neat.< /text>

Giraffe feeding is special and you have to wait in the queue for feeding. You save few dollars if you buy as Combo ticket along with park general admission.<//review>< pics>

Other than getting into the parking area, everything is done rapidly, check-in and buying tickets is fast. The dinasaur attraction and feeding the giraffes is great!  Food was very good and a reasonable price. Clean bathrooms!<//text>

I try to come here Everytime I visit my family in Fresno. I absolutely love this zoo, the animals truely looked happy and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful to us last time we went. We only had about an hour so the woman at the ticket booth gave some suggestions on what to do with that hour to make the most of it.<//Review>

Such a reasonable price zoo with the perfect amount of attractions for kids. We were visiting family from Seattle and we're very impressed with the food offerings and the zoo.</Review>

Aways a great place to go with family. Now that the safari park is finished we have been numerous times. This makes the park better and more fun for children. Love the sea lion show and feeding the giraffes.<//text>

I love how much the Zoo has expanded. I have had a membership for quite awhile and the direction of the Zoo is definitely going the right way.< /Text>

Having been a member of the Santa Barbara and Los Angeles Zoo’s  over the years when I moved to Fresno I was excited to discover  a zoo. It is a wonderful place. I have taken my grandsons several times. It is just the right size to be able to enjoy a few hours and not feel overwhelmed and exhausted by the experience. They recently added a water park/playground for young people and my grandsons really enjoyed it. The collection of animals is very impressive considering it is not especially large zoo. I heartily recommend this wonderful zoo as a place for families to have very pleasant day.< /text>

This zoo is large. To see it properly is an all day process. In winter, the zoo closes at 4. If you take time out to eat lunch, you'll be able to cover the entire zoo in just enough time. There is a variety of animals and plenty to see! The staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Definitely a family friendly place to visit.</text>

I have to say the Fresno zoo looks amazing.  Great place to bring the family. They have done so much renovations that it is a complete new Zoo if you haven't been here within the last 3 years.<//text>

Had a fabulous time!! Everything is so impressive compared to the last time I came 20+ years ago. I loved seeing the huge enclosure for the elephants and the rhinos. The huge restaurant, with great food, was an added plus! The grandkids loved the new kids area as well. We were a little disappointed that there were no zebras or any kind of bears. One of the zoo keepers was saying about the new tiger project, so we look forward to all the new projects that they are working on<//text>

The zoo is an amazing place to visit. It is very well laid out with enough shade everywhere to keep you from being in the sun all the time. The exhibits are very well done. Zoo staff all very friendly and helpful. We loved our experience at the zoo. I would recommend anyone to visit the Fresno Chaffee Zoo, it's an amazing place</review>

Not as often as I wanted, but still it was nice to get to see the animals. Loved to see the giraffes and elephants.  I could have just stopped at either of these and spend the rest of the day watching. A big thank you to the zoo employees for such a wonderful experience.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>Lovely medium sized zoo. We spent a couple of hours there and there was far more we could have seen. The enclosures are clearly built with the well being of the animals in mind, and the staff are engaging and knowledgeable. Feeding the giraffes was also a lot of fun.< /Review>< Pics>

Had a wonderful time at the ice cream social zoofari event. The producers ice cream was delicious as per usual. Only thing I didn't like were the protesters outside using loud megaphones to protest the diary farms used for the ice cream. My son has sensory integration issues and so loud noises like the megaphone are difficult for him to sit through. Can't wait to come back again next year for more great ice cream and zoo experience. :)< /text>

It’s really fun and exciting see all these animals and then across it are these two play grounds which you have to pay for but is totally worth it if you are with your kids 9/10<//text>

I love that I can take my son now any time of day and enjoy a new section of the Zoo every time we go. During any weather. The food is great. The staff is very knowledgeable and polite. I have yet to try all the events, but my family favorites so far are Halloween at the park and Christmas lights decor in season. I can go on and on about how great this place is.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

The food is way to expensive. If I'm looking at it from a business point of view like they are I'd have food for people on a budget. Fresno only has one Zoo. They should be taking advantage of that and have options for the high class, mid class and low class. Instead they have this take it or leave it pricing<//Text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>What an amazing day our family had at the Fresno Chaffee Zoo.   I am so impressed with this zoo!  Kopje Lodge is so impressive as a dining area.   You feel as though you are visiting Africa or Jurassic Park. When you go to the Sea Lion exhibit. Be sure to go below. So you can see under the waters surface. Awesome!  This zoo visit will leave you feeling like you aren't anywhere near Fresno.  They have tried so hard to mimic the animals natural habitat.   I highly recommend a visit.   You won't be disappointed!! Thank you too all that care for the animals and maintain this beautiful zoo.</review>< pics>

<review>The zoo is our favorite place!
We utilize many of the zoo's educational services including the behind the scenes encounters, tot time on week day mornings, and zoo camp over the summer.
We love the Ice cream Zoofari, Zoo Lights, and the Zoobilation.
Fresno is seriously lucky to have such an amazing place right in our backyard.
Be sure to eat there. The food is delicious and reasonably priced.< /review>< Pics>

I have many fond memories of visiting the zoo with family and my school. I remember when you could ride the camels and take a picture, my mom still has the photo.

Now that I'm older and have my own children I visited this weekend and am so happy to see the constant improvements and new exhibits. The cafe is gorgeous. The water playground is a gem when you get tired of walking around in the heat with a cranky toddler. I especially love the little tables and chairs in corners of the zoo to sit down and eat snacks I brought with us. I nursed my baby there comfortably and then when we continued our tour I was delighted to see they actually have a breastfeeding nook in the kids area by the food shack.

Sea lion cove is another favorite and to be able to see them swimming underwater was an awesome experience. Thank you Chaffee zoo and staff. Your hard work and dedication is appreciated by many families.<//review>

Always a fun place to visit. The zoo is doing so much upgrades and it's starting to feel like a safari here. The elephant and rhino exhibit looked awesome! Really liked the dining area they setup next to the elephants. Makes it feel like you're in another country viewing these animals roam freely. I hope they take over the entire Roeding park and turn it into a drive thru safari. That would be awesome!!!</Review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>The staff have always been really friendly and knowledge every time I've been there. I really enjoy the “new” hours that have actually been in effect for at least a year or two now lol. It can usually get pretty crowded, but my tip is to go on Thanksgiving Day because it never gets too crowded then. They are only open until 2 pm on Thanksgiving, but it makes an awesome family tradition :) (my family's been doing this tradition for about 4 or 5 years now maybe?) Either way, if you love animals and/or smallish zoos you'll enjoy the Fresno Chaffee Zoo. I come from Cleveland OH and always thought that zoo was too big. IMO the Fresno Chaffee Zoo is the perfect size ♥️</text>< Pics>

This zoo charges for everything including parking! If you do go check out the stingrays and nursing sharks. You got to stay in there a long time and it is perfect for anyone who has sensory needs!< /text>

They have done a fabulous job in the new safari section... There are a great number of well designed areas... love the area where you can walk among the kangaroos.  The new 'cats' are great.  I didn't eat here but the prices seem pretty reasonable to me... annual pass for families are a very good value!< /review>

<Review>Over the years this place has gotten way better. I remember being a kid and this being a school field trip and there really wasn't as much to see as there is now. This zoo has definitely gotten better and is now a great spot to check out if you're in the city. Lots of animals and a good ambient to visit.< /Review>< Pics>

The zoo has changed a lot since I was little. With the new additions of the sea lions and the Safari zone, this zoo is now one of the best in the state. If you are in the Central Valley, you don't have to go to the Bay area or down south to have a great zoo experience. It's right there in your backyard. Make a day of it and see how much it's changed for the better!!</review>

Amazing! Seems like all animals are treated right and Have a perfect habitat. Even tho the gift shop prices are high. That does change that the zoo actually carea about their animal.</text>

Fresno Zoo has changed for the better since I was a kid. The larger animals have larger space to roam. Zoo was clean and seemed to be kept up. I was there last for the zoofari with free ice cream stations throughout. Got to love all the specials the zoo does<//text>

The African exhibit is a lot of fun. They are still making more changes too. These changes were long overdue and I am glad to see that they are finally happening. I remember when I went in high school, I thought it was looking pretty sad back then. It's a completely different zoo now. My family and I are members and my kids love going there.

<Review>This zoo is wonderful. The price is very reasonable ($12 per adult, children's prices vary by age but are less). The zoo is landscaped beautifully, they take good care of the animals (which means you may not see certain animals if it's too hot outside), and the food near the African exhibit if very good (but pricey). Costs $5 to park for the day (but gives you access to the surrounding park). Bring $3 to feed the Giraffes! Petting zoo and wonderful reptile house also available. Bathrooms clean and well stocked. Family bathrooms also available.<//Review></record>

The zoo is very nice. We love to see the open spaces for the elephants, lions and giraffes! The food though ... please!! Eat before or after... everytime we visit, the food is bad. Last time, the burgers were dry, the pizza was dry... This time--- Even the snacks were stale! The popcorn was stale, the dried fruit cups were stale... Why?? They have a nice looking cafeteria... just bad food!<//text>

My wife, kids, and I came to Fresno for a wedding from Florida and decide to go to the zoo with our infant and 4 yr old. We must say that this was a Great zoo! Especially for the price! You get the chance to get up close and personal with so many animals like elephants, rhinos, gazelle, sloths, monkeys, a bunch of different species of birds, stingrays and sharks. There was also a great petting zoo area that you are able to interact and pet goats, baby cows, donkeys, turkeys, and lamas which my son and I enjoyed a lot! Plus We were amazed that our 4 yr old son was able to feed a giraffe in the new African animals exhibit (which is massive) for only $2. He was Sooo excited by the experience that he fed them 10 more times! The food and drink prices were very reasonable as well.  Plus they are military and senior citizen friendly and offer a discounted rate for both.  It was a great way for the whole family to hang out and not spend a lot of money. If we ever come back to the Fresno area we are definitely coming back to this zoo. We highly recommend it anyone!!!</Review>

They have changed so much,  I use to get sad that the elephants and others were in such small places like a jail for animals. They have improved so much I saw family of rhinos in the newly improved area with many other animals. I cannot express how happy I am that these animals are getting more space and it's beautiful how they are making it look. I will definitely come back to see how it is finished.< /review>

Great place to spend the day with kids! Best thing about the zoo is their membership prices for families which include unlimited # of children...so that means a family with 6 kids pays the same as a family with 3 kids. Coming from a household with 6 kids, I know that large families will appreciate this!< /text>

This is the most amazing zoo! Their open spaces with elephants and rhinos is only exceeded by the huge animal preserve near San Deigo. This is a very fun place. The guides are very nice and helpful. Children can feed the giraffes too. There are other new exhibits on the way, with plenty of open space. Fun open or closed dining areas are avail and the food and beverages are above expectation. Just come and have fun, but check the hrs first.</text>

You don't leave feeling an Injustice for the animals Also tour guides are throughout the park for questions and answers about the animals The environment is clean and signs are posted throughout pointing to exibits
Restrooms, changing and nursing stations, and food. A wonderful place to be on any day of the week.</review>

< Review>
Had a fabulous time!! Everything is so impressive compared to the last time I came 20+ years ago. I loved seeing the huge enclosure for the elephants and the rhinos. The huge restaurant, with great food, was an added plus! The grandkids loved the new kids area as well. We were a little disappointed that there were no zebras or any kind of bears. One of the zoo keepers was saying about the new tiger project, so we look forward to all the new projects that they are working on</Review>

<Text>The food is way to expensive. If I'm looking at it from a business point of view like they are I'd have food for people on a budget. Fresno only has one Zoo. They should be taking advantage of that and have options for the high class, mid class and low class. Instead they have this take it or leave it pricing< /Text>< resp>

The staff have always been really friendly and knowledge every time I've been there. I really enjoy the “new” hours that have actually been in effect for at least a year or two now lol. It can usually get pretty crowded, but my tip is to go on Thanksgiving Day because it never gets too crowded then. They are only open until 2 pm on Thanksgiving, but it makes an awesome family tradition :) (my family's been doing this tradition for about 4 or 5 years now maybe?) Either way, if you love animals and/or smallish zoos you'll enjoy the Fresno Chaffee Zoo. I come from Cleveland OH and always thought that zoo was too big. IMO the Fresno Chaffee Zoo is the perfect size ♥️</Review>

<Text>Being a Member, I don't ever have wait long. Show my pass, scan in, and adventure begins with my little crew.

We always eat at the Safari area. As a member, I get a discounts so I enjoy it. I don't wait too long for my food and portion is good size. Kids love the Mac N Cheese and I definitely love the portion of that. My most recent visit was about a month ago. I ordered extra fries like usual and this time I felt I got very little for the price I was paying.  Normally the fries would be enough for 3 kids, however on that day, it only was enough for 2 kids out of the 5. I didn't say anything at the time since I gave my meal to the kids because they were hungry.

For that particular day, I give the trip to the Zoo a 3 star rather than a 4 star.< /Text>< Time>

It would be nice if the parking was included in the membership, or at least discounted.  We tried to make it worth it and we stayed to see the ducks at the pond after the zoo closed up.  I guess they have a playground there in that large park , but we left before we had a chance to play there because the kids forgot to bring their jackets.

We have the annual membership and it's kind of annoying when we all have to identify ourselves each time we go.  But the kids enjoy going.</text>

<Text>Nice simple doggy park for your fur baby to just get out and run wild...
They have a water fountain for your doggy but make sure to bring poop bags for them.
Plus you can walk your doggy on a leash throughout Roeding park as well.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<review>I drive the two hours from Stockton to come to this zoo instead of any of the several that are closer to us because it's amazing!

They have the Stingray bay where unlike other places, you can actually feed them! It's 1 dollar for a cup of little fish and they come right up to you and eat from your hand!
You can also feed the giraffes which seems to what the younger kids really enjoy.
I haven't been through it but they have the Kanga walk as well.

My personal fave is the big cats which there is no shortage of. They have tons of room to run around and do lion, and tiger stuff!

Overall it's a really cool place and worth the visit for sure.<//review>< Pics>

I highly recommend a season pass if you have Kids. I also recommend getting a parking pass if you plan on going frequently. My kids love feeding the giraffes. The expansion is fantastic and seems like it gets better every time we go.</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Fun for the whole family...We fed a giraffe. We love the sea lions and seals, cheetahs, and learned a lot from the keeper talks! We have found that going in the winter is excellent because you get to ask a lot more questions during the keeper talks! When you get cold, go to the reptile house or the sloth habitat, which are both heated.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

We haven't been there in years and it all looked good.   The new part of the zoo was great.  Our Zoo is looking great!!  We took my 86 year old mom and she enjoyed herself and the food was there good too.  I highly recommend everyone to visit it.< /Review>

<review>My first visit to the zoo was wonderful! Couldn't brag enough to everyone about it. I was very disappointed on my visit this year seems like all the animals were missing no tortoise no bears only one elephant one ant eater seemed halp of what it was. Entry went from 10 bucks to 12.95 and only halp the animals.< /review>< Time>

I do love this zoo and am a member. Having visited zoos all over California, I can say there are some that I just find down right depressing. This is NOT one of them.
The chaffee zoo is both part of the conservation and repopulation programs, so you will often see babies at this zoo. They staff is amazing and willing to answer any question your overly exuberant child might ask. The zoo is also working hard to continually improve the animal habits, making them appear and feel more like natural habitats.
The African safari habitat is amazing and one of my favorite parts of the zoo.

Be prepared for the $5 parking fee. Buy your tickets online so you can skip the line at the gate. It will cost you $3 to feed the giraffes, and $2 to visit the stingrays and a dollar more feed them. The current dinosaur exhibition has an additional entrance fee.< /review>

An honest good day of fun.  Fun way to spend the day with the kids. And, for the animal enthusiast kids Chaffee offers summer and winter zoo camps which is a great opportunity for kids to learn about animals.<//review>

We just spent a great day at the Fresno Chafee Zoo. It was a beautiful day and the animals were out enjoying the weather. The African exhibit is great and it was very easy to see all the animals. We also participated in behind the scene animal encounters and sting ray cove, I would highly recommend!! We will definitely be back.</review>

<Text>I love this Zoo.. my son would come every week if he could. Staff are often frazzled and bossy.(snapped at my five year old old for roaring) but overall great. Side not in case staff read. Don't discourage a kid from learning animals and sounds the animals make. Don't just "don't do that, he does not like it" a child. Explain what the sound mimicking does to the animal. That's children 101 if your tired of being understanding and patient FIND ANOTHER JOB.</Text>< rate>

< Review>
The zoo has really been upgraded since the past few years. There are still new construction along the way. It's a nice place for my family and I to come enjoy the animals. Bring extra cash to feed the giraffes for $3 or pet the sting rays! You can spend hours here. Love it.</Review>

<Review>Great zoo, I love every square inch. But if I had to pick favorite animals, I do love the seals and the giraffes. Wonderful place for adults or children, they do a nice job here.</Review></record>

The only down side is that the cashier for the food was very rude. Her adittude was not okay, i didnt want to complain which i should have. But didnt because she was not going to ruin my day with my child. I had an amazing time and so did my son. He wants to go back and we will soon. His favorite was the lion we scattered the whole thing twice trying to look for it and we did find it. Was very fun.<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Great place to walk aerpijd and enjoy the different exhibits.   The price is reasonable and the sights are many.  Highly recommend good walking shoes.   Great number of chairs and benches to take a seat. Lots if things to do for the little ones.  Recommend clearing your calendar for the day and getting an early start to avoid the parking issues. Easy to find off the freeway and the staff are phenomenal.   Truly professional knowledgeable and courteous.   Thank you Fresno Zoo!</Review>

<review>Freaking gorgeous! As a Sacramento native I was expecting a sad zoo like Sacramentos, but they did a fantastic job with the renovations and all of the interactive enclosures are so fun. We were face to face with tiny money's, kangaroos, birds and more.. San Diego Zoo is gorgeous and takes first place, but I think this is my second favorite Zoo in California.</review><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>The zoo is always a great place to spend the day with family, especially little ones who have never been. The only down side, however, is that there is never enough shade in some areas. The "food court" area near the entrance to the Safari zone is the worst. There are tons of open tables that nobody wants because they have been roasting in the Valley heat all day. Other than that, it is always fun and enjoyable.<//Review><UserId.>104625574620606793189<//UserId.></record>

Absolutely loved this place,  i felt like I was in the countries where some of the animals actually come from,  the landscape of the whole zoo is beautiful,  the way each animals homes are set up , while we sat at th Kopje Lodge eating lunch we were able to look out at the elephant,  white rhinos & deers, it felt like I was on a safari adventure!  I definitely want to go back and take our grandchildren next. Definitely a place to visit while in Fresno< /review>

The habitats look natural for the most part, and we enjoy the interactive nature of this zoo, like the tiger feeding and giraffe feeding.  From the lizards to the elephants our kids where enthralled.  We been here twice since moving to the Valley.  We'll mostly likely be back soon.<//review>< Pics>

I hadn't been to the zoo in almost 15 years, and it's like a different place now. They've done an amazing job with the new attractions and sprucing up the older ones. It feels like a real, big-city zoo. Thankful we got the season pass.</review>

Love coming to the Fresno Zoo.  My kids love to feed the Giraffes. It's a very cute zoo. There's a nice park with a pond of ducks and geese in the parking area.< /review>

<Review>I love this park. This park holds many great memories to me; from swinging on the swings as a child to feeding the ducks and geese with my fiance.

My favorite section of the park is of course the geese and ducks. They are so cheerful and happy to see people all the time. They just want to be fed and full so they can sleep comfortable in there giant pond.

Being there is just relaxing overall. The green grass makes it peaceful, the trees make the place shady, and the overall setting is just great for families and close ones alike.

You can take meat over to the park and sit on the benches, barbequing all day. Take the family out for an escape away from home or just chill out on the grass with whoever you want. You're only limited to your imagination.

There's also bathrooms there, so it's an all day type of place, and there is also a zoo inside Roeding park.

The zoo holds many animals like lions, elephants, alligators, snakes, tortoise, and much more. It's just a place you have to go to enjoy and see it for yourself.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

African animal enclosures are better than anything you'll see in LA or San Diego, Santa Barbara Zoo.  Fresno Zoo has more space than any big city and they're using it very wisely.</text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>I would give 0 stars if I could.   Waiting for a meal was fine, but standing in line I waited patiently for 8-10 minutes.  When I get up to pay another lady steps in and asks if her soda coupons would work today.  The cashier says” let me take care of this person, I’ll be back in a few minutes,  please get in another line”.   So I moved over to start the 10 minute wait again.  By then the  food was getting cold.  After 10 minutes waiting the first cashier came back and other people jumped in line to pay for their food.   I give up!!  I’m going home and NEVER coming back!!!!</Text></record></dataset><record>

Chaffee Zoo has done an excellent job in the past 5-8 years of revamping the exhibits and family friendly activities and spots for kids. May 5th a large play area with water activities is opening up and it looks awesome. Price is affordable and parking is not usually too bad. I will continue to support Zoo measures as it looks as if the money is being spent productively.< /text>

Great family friendly place. Really like the upgrades. Some of the areas were dirty and construction filled when I went. But gotta understand it's only temporary and it's to build everyone something better. Only thing I wish they had were little baby kangaroos you might be able to pet in petting zoo. Like the fair used to have at 1 point before kids started getting sick. Possibly controversial but not like they don't have a petting zoo already, PEOPLE/KIDS just gotta wash hands before putting in their mouth....A NO BRAINER</Text>

This is an awesome zoo!  I admit I haven't been to many others, but I love our zoo!  The recent African Safari expansion is awesome and they are still working on getting more animals and filling in other areas!  The restaurant is right next to an area where the rhino's and emus might come by and pay you a visit.  Awesome experience!</text>

<Text>If you haven't been here for a while you are in for a treat! They have updated and remodeled so much in the last couple years. The newest and most impressive additions have included Sea Lion cove, an otter habitat, the new African Safari with lions, cheetahs, and rhinos.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<Response>None</Response><text>Had a wonderful time here. Staff is very knowledgeable. Facility is clean and open. Went with a few classmates, they have a lot of endangered species. Some animals are there for rehabilitation or because they have permanent disabilities (such as the blind sea lion). There is plent of space for the animals to roam, they are treated well and seem very content.< /text><GmapID>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6< /GmapID>< Date>

The zoo is always timeless visit. Since I was a girl, the zoo has always been a favorite. The new additions and upgrades are a plus for the newer generations but definitely the classic family fun or even for a date.< /Review>

<time>1524957975579<//time><rate>4<//rate><Review>The Chaffey Zoo was a lovely after noon visit. Parking, admission and food was reasonably priced. While it is not the San Diego Zoo, the exhibits were attractive. One thing that was cool was their attention to providing shade for visitors. We enjoyed being able to see the animals fairly closely. We were able to actually see all the big cats. I especially enjoyed the bird show, which closed with being able to pose for pictures with a large eagle owl or a beautiful golden eagle.<//Review>< Pics>

The zoo today is so special in it's magical way of bringing the wild animals of the world to life as kids see them alive and in a habitat designed to keep them comfortable with good vision of them . 60 years I've been going and it still has that special ability to renew imagination and appreciation of nature's best .< /review>

Awesome zoo! It's a great place to take the kids & even if you just want to take a date. Not a very big zoo but still a good size to have a good time.<//review>

The zoo experience has been totally transformed from when i was there a few years ago.  I was Pleasantly surprised by the new African exhibit!!!  The animals look happy and healthy.  Can't wait till all the animals are able to roam free.  It's an excellent and clean place to take your family and friends.<//review>

The zoo is a very nice zoo. There is a great range of animals, its laid out well, and the kids seemed to love it. We greatly enjoyed it!

Our only issue during the day was the customer service, or rather lack of, from the cafe to the shop, the stingray people to the front gate. Every person we spoke to was either rude, condescending, bored or a combination thereof. It left a sour note, especially when my 8 year old nephew asked for help in the shop with a product and was ignored by 2 staff members. I would think a place that deals with people on the regular would be more personable.< /text>

<Rate>4</Rate><text>The dog park is nice here and if you already have a parking pass you don’t have to keep paying $5 every time to park. Annual Park Passes can be purchased for $50 from the SP+ office in downtown Fresno and they are good for Roeding and Woodward park. You can use them for any of your vehicles too which is nice.

<text>Having grown up in Fresno and since moved away, I can honestly say this is one of the best zoos in California. Their dedication to making larger and more efficient habitats for the animals has created an experience you will never forget!! Sea Lion Cove is gorgeous, and The African Adventure exhibit is just amazing!!!
So proud that the citizens of my hometown and the efforts of Measure Z only continue to make this zoo more amazing!!<//text>< username>

It's kind of like a maze. I somehow missed out on quite a few attractions, but all-in-all it was beautiful. There are a lot of birds. The sea lions seem happy. The orangutans seemed bored. The reptile exhibit had a large variety and I really enjoyed the sting ray and shark exhibit. Feed the sting rays and sharks. They suck the fish and shrimp out of your hands. Don't be scared. I was scared and I'm glad I fed them. The sharks feel like rocks when you touch them.< /text>

It's an excellent zoo for the size and city it's in. Very nice, lots of shade, and the African display is beautiful.< /Text>

Its ridiculous how they make you pay to pet the sting rays and feed the giraffes. It's also not as big as I thought it'd be. But my kids loved it.</review>

Great sights and good food. They have all the normal fair food stuff, plus a restaurant where you can get burgers, pizza, sandwiches, etc. and sit outside in a large patio area right next to the big outdoor exhibit.</text>

< review>
Roeding Park Dog Park is divided into two sections, one for small dogs (less than thirty pounds) and one for larger dogs. There was water available for your dog and "poop bags". Apparently people used the bags because there was not an accumulation of dog feces, the grass area was kept clean. Only two other visitors while we were there. We spent approx. 2 hours. The small dog area had 1 picnic table in a shaded area for the people to sit and one cement bench in the sun. Big dog area had a picnic table in the sun, and no shade anywhere. Guess the weather would be the deciding factor, too hot to sit in the sun. Otherwise quiet, friendly and a nice experience.< /review>

Had a good few hours today at the Zoo.
Had lunch at the Kopje lodge, and enjoyed the view out to the Savannah.
The Zoo grounds were very clean inside, outside the facility in and around the parking lot a different story...We will return..< /Review>

Amazing before, now more than ever with the African Safari extension. We learned that zoo's around the world actually use Fresno Chaffee Zoo as an example of how it should be done!!!!!...6 stars</text>

Come here once or twice a year with my daughter.  The frogs and fairytale and Halloween events are great.  We love the new savannah attraction and feeding the giraffes but the wait is usually horrible.  The food in the food court is really good.  Recommend the chicken salad sandwich</Review>

We came here for my son's 2nd grade field trip. It was our first time and we loved it. I was thinking the zoo would be bigger but was delighted to see that it wasn't too big. The attractions are clean with clear views. The animals look well cared for. Great price.< /review>

<Text>Take the kiddos here once a week and always come with put of town guests. This is a FABULOUS zoo. All of the animals are rescues, woukd not survive in the wild or are part of a species rehabilitation program. Fantastic exhibits and reasonably priced, delicious food. So many learning experiences and activities for kids. They have sandboxes, fossil digs, sting ray touch exhibit. My daughter loves the safari jeep at the lion exhibit. Admission is very reasonable compared to other zoos. Its very clean and the staff is knowledgeable. Plus you can also buy a parking pass for the Fresno regional parks at their box office to save you a trip downtown.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjfsc6Z-408Z3teE_JA8jYBtGtAgg2lRiW-Mb5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6< /gmap_id></record>

<review>Like the San Diego zoo, but 1/3 of the price. Everyone is super friendly, the animals are rescues and look very happy and healthy. Amazing layout at the k lodge so you have lunch watching the animals in the Savana. Can't beat that< /review>< Pictures>

This place is really great for kids. With lots of experience especially during Christmas because they put up bright lights all around the park. This place' s mechendise and cafe are a little too expensive for my taste though. All in all, this is a pretty great zoo.<//Review>

I've been going to the Chaffee Zoo since i was in kindergarten. I love the Chaffee Zoo.
As an adult i purchased the membership for me and 2 adults with 2 children for $110. That's 365 days I'm allowed to go for FREE.
Within a week i made back what i spent here comes with a 10% discount as well.  This zoo has become apart of my life.  With the awesome water feature my daughter and i will coming here over the summer.  They have alot of events planned through out the year.
Please visit there website for more information<//Text>

Fresno Chaffee Zoo punches way above it's weight class. Definitely one of the nicest mid sized zoos I've been to. It's no destination zoo like Atlanta or San Diego, but it is worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood. Highly recommend.<//Text>

My family absolutely loves this zoo! We have been members for two years. They have something for every age group. You can pet the sharks and sting rays at Sting Ray Bay. Feed the giraffes in the new Safari area,  which is really AWESOME!! Cool down, and play in the water by the bone dig area. Watch a really neat bird show. Or sit for literally hours while your kids run from one side of the glass wall to the other, watching the sea lions play! They have multiple options for food. They have the traditional snack bar area that serves hot dogs, nachos,  corndogs , and drinks.  Or what we like to do is go to the Safari area.  They have this HUGE sitting area outside under a covered patio over looking the animals.  The have multiple little restaurants to choose from. (kind of cafeteria style) They have Italian food, deli style up scale sandwiches,  beef and chicken  burgers, chicken strips, sliders and more. Everything is made fresh while you wait right in front of you. If you are a member you will get discounts on everything 😉 I also recommend buying a few( depending upon how large your family is) of the novelty cups. The refills on them are only about a dollar and change. You can bring them w/ you each time you return to the zoo. It saves a lot of money. Also the food portions are quite large.  You could definitely get away with sharing your meals. Restrooms are always clean. Parking is only 5 bucks. I recommend coming early. I believe it opens at 8am. It's such a wonderful place to visit.  They animals are clearly will taken care of.  This zoo has inspired my daughter to be come a zoologist. The love for the animals really comes through when you speak to any of the zoo crew.</Review>

I have been going to the zoo as a child and taken my own children for over 50 years.  The zoo has changed SO much recently.  The African safari like exhibit has a large eating area where you can watch the Rhinos while you munch on a pizza or hamburger with your kids ( or now grandkids)  We just celebrated our granddaughters 7th birthday there an became annual pass holders.
Get to the zoo with your kids !<//Text>

<user_name>Arlene lena< /user_name><Review>The new exhibits are AMAZING! the layout of the zoo though,  makes ABSOLUTELY NO sense! You have to backtrack a few times just to see all the animals. Other than that, everything was great! Good family funday! Just remember to take cash because most of the attractions inside the zoo, are cash only.< /Review><gmap_id>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6< /gmap_id><resp>None<//resp>< Rating>

The zoo was so much more than I had expected.  The baby giraffe and the the elephants were my favorites.  The grounds were lovely, and the people were friendly and helpful.  Sea Lion Cove was very interesting, and I loved that it was landscaped with California native plants.  It was both lush and drought tolerant.< /review>

This is my first time going to the zoo since they remodeled it a few years ago, this place is huge now. Was surprised by how nice everything looks, plus the animals don't look like they are trapped in their enclosures.< /Text>

Easily the best zoo in the central valley. Exhibits are nice, animals are active and healthy, not as busy as Sam Francisco. Cheap too, two adults and a 3 year old was $30. Great zoo.< /text>

Totally worth going. Truck broke down in Fresno and wanted to have an afternoon that wasn't stressful. Animals were out and moving so that also added to the fun, missed giraffe feeding but stingray and shark meet and greet made up for that.

Staff was fun, Friendly and approachable. Even though I made it for (essentially) the end of the day they still wanted to engage and have more than just a surface level conversation. Met a twin who's twin also works there, I'm a twin so it felt kinda cool to have that and other neat little moments with the staff (thanks Amanda you were bubbly and it rubbed off made the afternoon more enjoyable)

Prices were quite reasonable and overall a good way to spend an afternoon.<//text>

It was a fun visit. Nice zoo, clean and the food court went quick even when you could tell it was busy. The street dog was very good, worth the 4.50. The staff was friendly and answered questions with smiles. The bathrooms I give 3 stars though.</Review>

Affordability, quality of habitats, and exceptional upkeep of the animals, makes this park a must see destination! I was thoroughly impressed by the design of the African Safari portion of the park and there are plenty of shade trees to keep you cool. They also have a petting zoo!!! Low price and big family fun!</Text>

One of the best Zoo's in California,  don't miss this one. Compared to the San Diego Zoo the city has a tax measure that helps expand an improve this Zoo. The new African exhibit is awesome. The also have a winged wonders bird show you won't want to miss. Parking can be difficult so get there early.</Text>

This place was amazing! My boyfriend and I drove two hours just to see the zoo. It was well worth every penny! We got to touch stingrays and feed giraffes.  All of the exhibits where great! The sea lion cove was up close and personal.  All of the staff were friendly and the animals were too. Overall the place was wonderful.<//Review>

The Zoo has really made some great improvements! Check out the Giraffe area, lions, elephants, sea lion cove, and the Roo walk a bout. The new area has great food, a cozy place to sit, and the animal enclosures are stunning. The design is too beautiful for words. YOU NEED TO GO. Support the zoo, the animals, and help with conservation.</text>

This Zoo is amazing! And it just keeps on getting better! After Prop Z past they started renovating everything. There will soon be an "African Safari" type area as well, when they take over about 20 acres of land from the surrounding park. It should be an incredible sight to see when it opens!<//text>

< Review>
The African Adventure is a great example how enclosures should be nowadays-more space. The Kopé Lodge has decent food and provides a nice sitting view to rest and watch the safari. The only concern is the placement of the Asian elephants, tigers, and sloth bears.  They are often overlooked and kept in small enclosures. Every time I pass them they are depressed and sleep most of the time.< /Review>

This is the only zoo that I know of in the area, so it's a relief that it is so good. The exhibits are well made, and the animals are well taken care of.< /text>

If your a member you should at least get a better discount then what they give for food or anything else paying $100 for a membership it would be cool to get a little more of a discount on things<//Text>

It was a chilly day (Jan 7th) and a bit damp, but many of the animals were very active and eating breakfast when we were there. The keepers were very friendly and helpful. We had a wonderful time!< /Review>

What a fun day! Great deal on the price of admission, lots of great animals to see. The African safari exhibit is quite splendid. Members of staff are friendly and passionate and know all the animals names and back-story's. Can't wait for my next visit! Snack and food options while inside are limited and expensive.< /text>

Lots of animals to see very inexpensive for all of the animals you see it took us 4 hours to see everything. Great place and can't wait to take my daughter when she's old enough.<//Text>

Wonderful time for the price of a movie ticket you could see a huge selection of animals big and small! You must go to the sea lion show! It's done twice a day so get there early!!</Text>

<Review>Very good selection of animals in naturalistic habitats that allow good views of the animals.  Great people to help
Reasonably priced snacks.  Small enough to see it all with older kids.  Large enough to a variety.</Review>< Name>

<Review>Great zoo! The only downside is the parking to get into the park that houses the zoo, story/play land and the park. Remember to bring it in cash too, 5$. The African exhibit is amazing, the reptile house is fun and don't forget the sea lion and seal exhibit either.</Review><gmapID>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6< /gmapID><name>Eric Larsen</name><UserId.>109789041850632480731<//UserId.></record>

My parents took us to this zoo many years ago, I was there with my Grandkids. I had as much fun seeing their little faces light up at all the wonderful exhibits. The upgrades are amazing. Much more kid friendly.<//review>

Beautiful zoo! We love it here! Shayna the Zoo Keeper was fantastic with my animal loving son. She totally made his day! We were just overwhelmed by how crowded it was today, especially since there wasn't a special event going on. I'm so glad we have our membership and were able to skip the rediculously long line.</review>

The reptile exhibit is pretty cool. It was a nice zoo and not too expensive to get in. Food and drinks are expensive here if you plan to eat here. Went around the whole zoo but they were missing a few animals. Some you couldn't see because they were sleeping in the shade away from sight but that's okay. Nice place to walk around on a date or bring the kids. I wish I could have seen the elephant and the rhino's a little closer but them having space to roam around is better for them. It gets hot so make sure to stay hydrated.<//Review>

The enterance and the first exibits I visited were beautiful, leading to the only problem I seen, the Giraffe feeding. We are allowed to feed the giraffes, but not allowed to touch them. This doesn't seem like a too big of a problem, until you have many children in the feeding area being yelled at from staff not to touch them Every time they hold their hand out. If giraffes are so dangerous that they can break your hand in one hit with their head, why couldn't they have us pay to feed another less dangerous animal. Staff should not have to yell at children to not touch the giraffes from across the exibit. The feeding area should be closed and the giraffes should only be looked at from a view like all the other animals.</review>

It's a cool place, small playground, the thing I didn't like is even outside the "dog park" fenced in area, where they can run free, I still kept finding poop everywhere. (Dog of course) I couldn't even play soccer with my son in the field because it was everywhere<//review>

Small Zoo,  all the animals the kids' wanted to see were not out, ultimately the kids were bored. Took about 45 mins to walk around the entire Zoo. We were visiting from Texas and this compared to our Houston Zoo this was night and day difference. Not worth it. (Visited back in 2011)</Text>

When I traveled to Fresno and was lucky enough to have a little time the afternoon before I left, I thought visiting the zoo would be a nice way to kill some time. I completely underestimated this zoo. It was fantastic! The African exhibit was incredible and I could have spent the entire day watching the animals interact on the Savannah. The monkey cage was also ablot of fun. They had stingrays that you could pay to interact with that looked fun, but I didn't a chance to participate. My only complaint was the sea lion habitat. The habitat itself was beautiful, but it was so big I just stared at empty water the whole time. Overall it was amazing and I will definitely go back!< /text>

<text>One of the best zoological gardens anywhere! But currently remodeling and moving many of the exhibits leaving lots of empty areas. Very popular in Fresno. The African Adventure is amazing and also the Sea Lion Cove. We purchase annual membership so our children and grandchildren always have a zoo visit to look forward to when they come to see us in Fresno. Feed a giraffe! Pet the stingrays! Chillax in the Amazonian Rainforest!</text><user_id>107817061231863195517< /user_id>< gmap_id>

Went to see the African Adventure area. It was done very well. The animals were all out to see. Some sunning and napping. Ate lunch at the African Adventure eatery. Food was good and price reasonable. They also have specialty coffees and baked goods. All in all a good day. Get there early on  weekdays as there are MANY school children visiting.< /review>

Very nice zoo, parking will get pretty crazy on weekends and you have to pay to park before you even step foot to pay to enter the zoo. But they have numerous animals that you would find at any other zoo. The staff here are great, and very knowledge about each animal they have. The cafe is in the heart of the zoo and it was also really good. Maybe we were just starving lol.. They have nachos, hotdogs, churros, grilled sandwiches, chicken salads, burgers.. Also a good selection of desserts like cookies, brownies, pie, etc..</text>

<text>If you're stuck in Fresno for some god awful reason and are looking for something to do, go to this zoo. It's surprisingly amazing, especially with the new African exhibit. Every time I go I'm always impressed since it seems like Fresno shouldn't have something this nice. The price is very low too, especially compared to big name zoos like in San Diego. Definitely opt for feeding the giraffes since it's only like 2 bucks but is a lot of fun and makes a great picture. Parking sucks though. Last time I went was on Labor Day weekend and we were gridlocked in the overflow lot for a good 10 or 15 minutes. I'm surprised we even found a spot. The walk from the parking lot to the zoo can be pretty long too.<//text>< gmap_id>

<review>I want to give a shout out to Fresno Chaffee Zoo.
Growing up with Chaffee Zoo and Roeding Park filled my mind with many exciting memories as a child that has helped shaped my character, personality, and well being, with adventure treks and escapades of a little ones imagination to the profound respect for animals, being an animal lover myself.
I witnessed all the amazing upgrades and transformation of Chaffee Zoo and all for the better of the animals and entertainment.
Yes there were dark days of yesterday's past with the famous Nosey the elephant who spent many of her years in a tight closed-in metal bar space. As a child it was so exciting at that time to be able to feed her peanuts. I will not forget the touch of her trunk, she loved people. I profoundly remember a donation bin to upgrade Noseys environment, one which you drop your coin as it spirals down in a circling cyclone. Thank God Fresno residents came through along with many others in thier contributions, I believe it was in 1982 Nosey had a new upgraded and amazing home now of natural dirt, a swimming pool, waterfall, and toys to play with. She also for the first time in over 30 years had other elephant companions. I'm glad she had this experience before her passing. I believe to this day it was Nosey who inspired many to fight for the animals here to have much more. Yes there's the bitter/sweet of animals being in captivity but today most of these animals were born more or less in captivity and wouldn't survive the wild. So enjoy the many adventures to come. Thank you all who had part in giving Nosey her new home and for the amazing upgrades of the Fresno Chaffee Zoo.
As an adult I walk into the zoo with my annual membership and my children at my side seeing the excitement of sparkle in eye. It these moments that I re-live the child in me. Let the journey begin!<//review></record>

Very good some things are over priced but they have to make money somehow considering how cheap the entrance is the view is amazing very big and still expanding you should visit the goat and the wolves I whould recomend to anyone  who likes wild animals< /text>

When I traveled to Fresno and was lucky enough to have a little time the afternoon before I left, I thought visiting the zoo would be a nice way to kill some time. I completely underestimated this zoo. It was fantastic! The African exhibit was incredible and I could have spent the entire day watching the animals interact on the Savannah. The monkey cage was also ablot of fun. They had stingrays that you could pay to interact with that looked fun, but I didn't a chance to participate. My only complaint was the sea lion habitat. The habitat itself was beautiful, but it was so big I just stared at empty water the whole time. Overall it was amazing and I will definitely go back!<//text>

It's had a lot of improvements since the last time I went. The whole family had fun. I just dislike the hours of operation. I do wish they'd be open longer.< /text>

I visit to Fresno Chaffee Zoo today and I was very disappointed because elephant the kind of skinny and the sea lions those are bigger and very happy and Indian and dining area where you can buy food at where the green chairs are at they should have some kind of side that window or some new pictures up there so it more attractions in the zoo to track more people and kids in there because it's boring</Review>

Nice zoo, seems they are constantly improving it too. Nice habitats like African adventure, sting ray bay, sea lion cove, and more! The zoo lights at christmas is very cool too!<//Review>

I love the zoo. I only have 2 complaints, that "zooracic park" thing was stupid.  The other thing is that I never see the keepers out.  Used to be you would see them around even if it was keeper talk time.  I miss that</review>

<rate>5</rate><text>Excellent for families with younger children. I recommend getting the Family membership! Plenty of Zoo Events, but are always really crowded.

Edit- we've moved out of CA, and our new local zoo cannot compare to the Fresno Chaffee Zoo! Fresno's zoo has TONS of activities that many other zoos don't (Dino Dig, Stingray Bay, the bird show, giraffe feedings, Small Wonders petting zoo..) in addition to the best exhibits I've seen in nationwide (African Adventure, Sea Lion Cove ..)</text>< pics>

As zoos go I'll as far as to say it's a C+. To start, at it's busiest parking is impossible. The lot arrangement is poor due to it's single entry/exit point, lack of room, and the fact that it is shared by the amusement park across the street. Parking was $5 but I could see it being free when it's not so busy.

The membership to the zoo for a whole family is $99, if you can't decide if you want to buy it in line you can actually pay your normal entry fees and then comeback and have that day's fees go toward the  membership if you do decide to get one. There are, of course, different levels to membership but the gist is you can stroll in on the member line and get 10% off purchases in the zoo.

The zoo itself does have some great exhibits, most of what you'd expect to find at a zoo but some are just a bit lacking. I've only been here a few times so there may be other ways around but from what I can tell there are at least two, maybe more, exhibits that so not have handicap/stroller ramps on one or both sides.

The dining facilities range from a medium sized quick bite spot to a large shaded, artesianal foods with an amazing view of the zoo's largest exhibit containing many African favorites cohabitating in one area. There aren't many food stands or generally opportunities for snacks besides these two spots and the gift shop - wouldnt want to tempt people to feed the animals I guess...I still wish they had Dippin' Dots..

Animals seem well taken care of and there are certainly a variety to be seen. If I could change one exhibit, I'd give the Tiger much more space. Seems a shame but you be the judge.

This zoo is well kept and popular with locals but it really doesn't have that something to it that I would needed to want to keep coming back. It's not bad by any means, just average I think.</review>

Very sad zoo. Never thought a zoo could be so boring. It has very little animals. The layout of this zoo is very frustrating. More than half of the animals are not visible< /Review>

I took my family for my daughter's fourth birthday. Everything was exciting. Visitors were disgusting, though, kept throwing trash on ground and disregarding "no touching" rules for animals. Staff was very friendly and kept animals well being in mind. Will definately go again.< /review>

Visited 2 weekends in a row. Not that its that big, but had enough fun to see it again. Giraffe feeding, Stingray petting/feedings, and a petting zoo for the kids. The kids almost had more fun than I did!< /review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>This zoo is amazing. I remember as a kid when Prop Z was considered thanks to the measure passing this zoo is incredible. I traveled the couple hours to visit the Santa Barbara zoo and was so disappointed. We have a zoo in Atascadero and its so sad how everything is kept. The great changes from the zoo from always been kept tidy to the friendly staff. I don't enjoy other zoo's anymore. Pricing may seem a bit high living in Fresno but its actually half of what of other places charge. The Santa Barbara Zoo was so blah and yet we paid so much more for a whole lot less. If you have nothing to do and you have young ones I highly suggest this place. Its a great way to let them run around and explore a different world.< /review>< time>

<review>price of food was too high.
animals looked sad.
some exhibits were closed.
can walk through the whole Zoo in an hour.
boring.
the only good thing about this Zoo is that it's cheap to get in.
it's a one star compared to the San Diego Zoo.</review><name>Nancy Saucedo</name><rate>1< /rate><response>None<//response><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< time>

<review>2 stars for ONE reason. This employee “Sofia” that worked the area with the Sloths and Mata Mata turtles, the humid environment. Was VERY RUDE to my 5 year old son and was speaking to people as if they were stupid. When my 5 year old asked a question. The look she gave my five year old was absotluey Appalling. She looked at him as if he was absolutely STUPID. Unbelievable. I told her; “ he’s 5. He’s not asking  collegiate level type questions”. She assumes everyone is supposed to know everything about that environment. She needs to slow her role or be replaced. She can’t be treating people like that<//review>< pictures>

Horrible upsetting experience!!! My first time visiting this small zoo, I assumed it would be worth it especially getting to feed the giraffes. Most animals were sleeping or hidden, mind you it’s mid-morning only! But what made it worse was the employee Karen at the feeding encounter who completely made a scene when we requested to feed the first giraffe to take a memorable photo of my kids feeding the giraffe who stood taller and was able to lean over the ledge. Got into an argument with the Karen as if we were holding up the line after standing in a long line to purchase the lettuce. I even offered to allow others to go ahead of us but she would not stand for it. She refused to allow us to feed the first giraffe, forced us to feed the second giraffe thru the fence. We would probably have to get into the line to buy more lettuce for a chance to get to feed the first giraffe. I understand that you guys are trying to make money but this was for my family memory and due to this awful experience with Karen, we left the zoo, and wasted our money and time.<//text>

The new upgrades to the zoo are insane! The African Safari makes you forget that you are actually still in dirty old Parkside Fresno. Sea Lion Cove, Stingray exhibit, all awesome. You can actually stay here for hours and get tired of walking around. Not at all like the zoo I remember as a kid.<//Review>

Had a great time, spending our afternoon there for our 49th anniversary. Haven't been there in at least 20 years, except for hauling equipment in and out for Harris Construction. One thing that bothered me is that you have a major problem with a lot of dead trees and limbs that need to be taken care of. They are a major liability,  not only to visitors,  but the animals also. Great job,  great place,  not like I remembered at all. Bob and Patti Groh,  Madera Ranchos.</Review>

And it wasn't just a few employees that went out of their way. Everywhere we went, from the elephants, the llama petting, turtle exhibit, to the sting-rays, all the staff was great. An Asian guy named Mike was just the best, who totally explained to my 3 year old daughter that the turtles just like to wrestle a lot, and to not be alarmed :) he was amazing! We've had bad trips out before, but today was just magic. My thanks to the staff for making our day today one of our most memorable family outing in Fresno.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

A lot of care has gone to this zoo. It was just OK years ago, now it is very nice and clean. The African Adventure is amazing.<//text>

Excellent zoo. Theres all kind of special events going on with during the whole year. It's been upgraded the cages and the enclosures are big. Roading park there as well train rides and other rides there also Storyland which is great for the younger kids. Reoding Park and Chaffee Zoo are very nice.<//Text>

To start, at it's busiest parking is impossible. The lot arrangement is poor due to it's single entry/exit point, lack of room, and the fact that it is shared by the amusement park across the street. Parking was $5 but I could see it being free when it's not so busy.

The membership to the zoo for a whole family is $99, if you can't decide if you want to buy it in line you can actually pay your normal entry fees and then comeback and have that day's fees go toward the  membership if you do decide to get one. There are, of course, different levels to membership but the gist is you can stroll in on the member line and get 10% off purchases in the zoo.

The zoo itself does have some great exhibits, most of what you'd expect to find at a zoo but some are just a bit lacking. I've only been here a few times so there may be other ways around but from what I can tell there are at least two, maybe more, exhibits that so not have handicap/stroller ramps on one or both sides.

The dining facilities range from a medium sized quick bite spot to a large shaded, artesianal foods with an amazing view of the zoo's largest exhibit containing many African favorites cohabitating in one area. There aren't many food stands or generally opportunities for snacks besides these two spots and the gift shop - wouldnt want to tempt people to feed the animals I guess...I still wish they had Dippin' Dots..

Animals seem well taken care of and there are certainly a variety to be seen. If I could change one exhibit, I'd give the Tiger much more space. Seems a shame but you be the judge.

This zoo is well kept and popular with locals but it really doesn't have that something to it that I would needed to want to keep coming back. It's not bad by any means, just average I think.<//Review>< pictures>

I've never seen anyone else at this dog park, and it's probably because its location next to the freeway is not appealing to humans, nor does it provide any shade in the large dog park area. With all of the large trees and beautiful areas within Roeding Park, the city could have provided a nicer and much larger area for the many canines and their human companions who live in this area.< /Text>

The zoo has great exhibits (the African Adventure exhibit is pretty incredible) and there are several fun events throughout the year (like the Ice Cream Zoofari). They've been working hard on it for the past several years and it shows.< /text>

Zoos okay. Not worth the price nor the entrance fee. Unfortunately, the park is horrible which reflects the zoo. Food overpriced, restrooms not clean, and bad customer service. Did enjoy the new exhibits, yet animals seem unhappy, depressed. Fresno really needs to invest more money into the park and restore some culture back to the city.<//review>

I live near this zoo and it is the best zoo in the area and since the African exhibit opened it grew of me and my family to visit the zoo and I recommend to absolutely visit this zoo if you live in the Central Valley and visit if you're visiting the Central Valley.< /Text>

Probably the best family activity in fresno. Sea lion cove, the rainforest, and African safari are especially great. Some of the old exhibits are a little sad. Annual membership for 2 adults and all children is only $75.<//Text>

I hadn't been here since 1999 when it was "Roeding Park Zoo" I wasn't expecting such a great experience! Before we arrived, I figured the kids would be bored, and ready to leave the zoo in an hour. The whole family was impressed, and 3 hours flew by. The Africa exhibit is a truly immersive experience. When you take a picture here, people will think you were in Africa. In addition to many awesome exhibits, you can feed Girraffes, Pet Goats, Touch StingRays, and Sand Sharks. You can even feed a Stingray! Definitely worth checking out!</review>

I've never seen anyone else at this dog park, and it's probably because its location next to the freeway is not appealing to humans, nor does it provide any shade in the large dog park area. With all of the large trees and beautiful areas within Roeding Park, the city could have provided a nicer and much larger area for the many canines and their human companions who live in this area.<//text>

I haven't been here for maybe 20 years. I was afraid it was going to be the same crappy zoo it used to be. I was wrong. Clean. Well kept and clearly moving away from cages to more open animal friendly habitats. I like the direction they are going. It was worth the stop for a few hours of walking around with the family.</review>

Probably the best family activity in fresno. Sea lion cove, the rainforest, and African safari are especially great. Some of the old exhibits are a little sad. Annual membership for 2 adults and all children is only $75.< /Text>

I live near this zoo and it is the best zoo in the area and since the African exhibit opened it grew of me and my family to visit the zoo and I recommend to absolutely visit this zoo if you live in the Central Valley and visit if you're visiting the Central Valley.</text>

Love the new area for the animals to rome. The only reason gave it a star less is San Diego Zoo is still bigger, but Fresno is improving for sure.< /text>

<Text>Until today I hadn't been here for about 7 years or so .  My wife and I took our 2 & 4 year olds today and I was expecting decent zoo and fairly quick trip.  I was amazed at what they've done with the place and my wife and I both agreed that this may now be our favorite zoo in California (and we've done all the major cities).  The new(ish) safari area sold it for us.  All of the animals were out and visible.  Can't be beat for the price imo.  Note:. We didn't purchase any food so I can't speak to that.  Otherwise, easy to get around, something around every corner, not too big, not too small.....very impressed.< /Text>< username>

This is a great zoo. Recently enrolled my kids in zoo camp (2 hours of driving each day for a week). The photo I took with my kids is one I used on a book cover and had enlarged to put up on my wall.

I've visited often with and without the kids. Regular times and special events - ice cream, behind the scenes, Dia de la Familia, Zoo Boo, Zoo Lights, and Safari Night (adults only).

The zoo keepers are friendly and knowledgeable, care about the animals and give the administration ideas about constantly improving and updating the zoo.

On hot days there is now a kids water play area, and we always visit the reptile house (probably the most comfortable spot in the zoo).

Also recommend venturing up to the African Safari area. Not only is it well done but that's where you'll find the best food in the zoo. Woodfired pizza is our favorite. Then see the cheetahs up close (glass wall). Closer than any other zoo I've visited.

Too many great exhibits and experiences to list. Well worth the visit and certainly an amazing value for a family!</Text>

After the new additions, the place is awesome! I grew up coming to this place and it was alright, but considering the admission price and what you get for a city the size of Fresno, it's great.< /review>

Just got back from this dog park, and we will not be going back. There were a dozen homeless hanging around outside the the fence, with their dogs running loose inside. Two very aggressive dog's were left inside the large dog area, with no one willing to accept the ownership of these animals. Hopefully someone will correct these problems, so responsible people and dog's may use the area.</text>

I see some reviews complaining about the prices and options for food at the zoo... I always pack a healthy lunch for my kids. Easy fix. You can bring food and drinks into the zoo, just no alcohol and no straws. The one time that I did buy food, I got a Caesar salad in the eatery in African Adventure. It was actually less expensive than I expected it to be, and it was quite large. Couldn't finish it myself. Very tasty.

I love the staff and the animals always  seem happy. (Only exception being a tigress who was in heat and upset that the male wasn't interested.  Poor gal.)

I love the meerkats and the reptile room!! The kids love the dino dig - can't do the zoo without the dino dig!<//Review>

<review>This is a miraculously well kept zoo that you probably wouldn't expect from Fresno if you've lived in the area for a substantial period of time.</review>< GmapID>

After the new additions, the place is awesome! I grew up coming to this place and it was alright, but considering the admission price and what you get for a city the size of Fresno, it's great.< /text>

<Text>I see some reviews complaining about the prices and options for food at the zoo... I always pack a healthy lunch for my kids. Easy fix. You can bring food and drinks into the zoo, just no alcohol and no straws. The one time that I did buy food, I got a Caesar salad in the eatery in African Adventure. It was actually less expensive than I expected it to be, and it was quite large. Couldn't finish it myself. Very tasty.

I love the staff and the animals always  seem happy. (Only exception being a tigress who was in heat and upset that the male wasn't interested.  Poor gal.)

I love the meerkats and the reptile room!! The kids love the dino dig - can't do the zoo without the dino dig!</Text>< pics>

Went with my sons class and had alot of fun. My son really enjoyed the animals he got to see them all without having to fight his way through. The food was a little pricey but im sure the cost to take care of the animals isnt cheap either.< /Text>

We were impressed at the size of zoo.  I would like to make some suggestions. Before that , I want to thank you for free parking for disable persons. Also your discount on senior admission. I was surprised to find you offered no discount for vets with disibilities or seniors on you electric carts. Both could really use a break on the $20 dollar charge. Being a senior myself, it is hard to push my husband around in wheel chair up hills or even flat surfaces.  We came early because of heat. However when it got hot, you had shade to eat in but it was still hot. I would like to suggest miss
ters in several places. Children become quite heated also. Cooling places would really help them. Also in one area where children feed animals, the soap quickly ran out. You have people selling food, maybe someone could help keep an eye on soap too.
We found amimals well cared for and clean areas they lived in. Restrooms also clean. Overall our trip was a good one and we only cut short because of heat for us.  Thank you for asking.</Text>

<review>I was so depressed after visiting this zoo.  I felt so sorry for all the animals.  The grizzly bear was sick, under medical care.  We heard on news two weeks later, she had to be put to sleep.  One of the large galapagos turtles had big pus in corners of both eyes.   The animals looked so sad.  I will not go back to this zoo.</review>< Pictures>

The zoo has really grown the price if the food and thing for the kids was high.The price to get in was not bad.But the sea lion cove and the stingray bay does not look like what they show on TV. The staff were nice.</Text>

We arrived at opening (9am) and stayed until closing (4pm).  We didn't have time to visit the reptile house, but we spent an hour and a half walking around with a napping toddler in a stroller.  The new African exhibit is amazingly beautiful, and I love that the animals are all together.  The lion cub was out and playing with its mom right up against the glass.  We were definitely impressed by the new zoo additions.  It had probably been 10-15 years since I last visited.

I am only giving 4 stars since, after visiting several zoos over the last couple of years with a little one, there were a few things that struck me during our visit: 1) Zoo staff is not uniformly dressed and in most cases, not easily recognizable.  Most of the staff wore plain, nondescript black jackets.  They might have had the zoo logo on the breast, but that was about it.  When we had a question, we found ourselves wandering around until we heard a [very loud] walkie talkie/radio, which most wear. 2) Bathrooms are few and spread pretty far apart. 3) Many of the animals had old/poor descriptions or even no description at all.  There were a few exhibits that had no signs with any information about the animals.  There are scheduled talks about some of the more popular animals, but I have been to other zoos that have signs that mention the animals by name, talk about their background, etc., in addition to the information about the species, and it's really much nicer.  4) What happened to all the birds in the Rainforest?  I remember as a kid the Rainforest was AMAZING because there were birds everywhere.  During our recent visit, we only saw a small assortment of ducks, a couple other species, and the macaws.

Overall, we had a great time at the zoo.  One thing did strike me and make me sad, though, and that is all the signs with the number to call if you see someone abusing the animals.  I thought, "Do people really do that?"  Apparently, it's enough of a problem that the signs are necessary.  So sad.<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Our not-quite-2-year-old had a GREAT time at the zoo!  We arrived at opening (9am) and stayed until closing (4pm).  We didn't have time to visit the reptile house, but we spent an hour and a half walking around with a napping toddler in a stroller.  The new African exhibit is amazingly beautiful, and I love that the animals are all together.  The lion cub was out and playing with its mom right up against the glass.  We were definitely impressed by the new zoo additions.  It had probably been 10-15 years since I last visited.

I am only giving 4 stars since, after visiting several zoos over the last couple of years with a little one, there were a few things that struck me during our visit: 1) Zoo staff is not uniformly dressed and in most cases, not easily recognizable.  Most of the staff wore plain, nondescript black jackets.  They might have had the zoo logo on the breast, but that was about it.  When we had a question, we found ourselves wandering around until we heard a [very loud] walkie talkie/radio, which most wear. 2) Bathrooms are few and spread pretty far apart. 3) Many of the animals had old/poor descriptions or even no description at all.  There were a few exhibits that had no signs with any information about the animals.  There are scheduled talks about some of the more popular animals, but I have been to other zoos that have signs that mention the animals by name, talk about their background, etc., in addition to the information about the species, and it's really much nicer.  4) What happened to all the birds in the Rainforest?  I remember as a kid the Rainforest was AMAZING because there were birds everywhere.  During our recent visit, we only saw a small assortment of ducks, a couple other species, and the macaws.

Overall, we had a great time at the zoo.  One thing did strike me and make me sad, though, and that is all the signs with the number to call if you see someone abusing the animals.  I thought, "Do people really do that?"  Apparently, it's enough of a problem that the signs are necessary.  So sad.</Review>

Ok zoo, has a variety of animals, reptiles, birds & different things to see. Has a couple areas to sit & eat at. Also has a gift shop most items are over priced & expensive. Overall was nice visiting the zoo.<//review>

< Review>
I grew up going to the zoo. It was always a special treat to go see Nosey the elephant.  I still miss him. I have grown up, I am now 57 an!d live in Oregon. I love the zoo! I always have and always wil. Thanks to this great zoo no matter where we travel I always want to find the nearest zoo !. All because of the Fresno zoo! P.s. I love storyland too !!!<//Review>

<Text>Everybody loves a zoo but when we went a certain day we didn't create as much as we did when we last went you can't get a Zoo discount I believe from La as well that would be valid that's only if you're going to go a couple of times during the year and don't forget to support your Storyland<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<text>There's quite a bit to do at roeding Park. You can visit the zoo, go to storyland, ride the rides at Playland, and/or play in the water at Playland. You can have the kids play at one of the parks within roeding park, or you could just relax with family and bbq!</text><gmapID>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6<//gmapID><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<review>Great park with a wide variety of mature trees covered and noncovered picnic/BBQ locations, tennis courts, memorials,  statues ponds, open grass fields, dog park ect.
Not to forget home to The Chaffee Zoo with the recently opened African Adventure(awesome)
Also within the part is Playland and Storyland.</review><GmapID>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6</GmapID>< Date>

I really wanted to give it a 5 stars but the only reason for 4 is the food ,is kind of expensive 1 bottle of water is 2:50 ,I suggest taking some snacks and water .they been adding more attraction so there are more things to see.<//text>

Restrooms are filthy. Plus they want to charge you a $5 fee just to go in during the day. Unacceptable.</review>

<Time>1603229328613<//Time><user>107707317216413337477<//user><Review>(Translated by Google) The zoo is great. Very clean, well-groomed animals. We really liked that you can feed the giraffes. Everyone was delighted. It is very interesting to watch elephants. Everywhere there is a good view and you can safely observe the animals. There are several fast food zones on the territory of the zoo. If you are tired, there are many places to sit and relax.

(Original)
Зоопарк великолепный. Очень чистый, животные ухоженные. Нам очень понравилось что можно покормить жирафов. Были в восторге все. Очень интересно наблюдать за слонами. Везде хороший обзор и можно спокойно наблюдать за животными. На территории зоопарка есть несколько зон фастфудов. Если вы устали то есть много мест где можно посидеть и отдохнуть.< /Review>< Response>

<rate>4< /rate><Resp>None< /Resp><Text>(Translated by Google) We were traveling from San Francisco to Exeter to visit the Sequoia National Park and, to break the long journey, we decided to stop in Frasno and visit the Zoo. It was never more appropriate choice! Really beautiful, full of animals of every species, very large and with many attractions (to eat giraffes, walk in the cage of kangaroos, brush the goats). I remember it was really hot, so bring a hat and plenty of ice water. Great food also point to the zoo, the prices were affordable so you can safely stop for lunch and then leave.

Eravamo in viaggio da San Francisco a Exeter per visitare il Sequoia National Park e, per spezzare il lungo viaggio, abbiamo deciso di fermarci a Frasno e visitare lo Zoo. Mai scelta fu più azzeccata! Veramente bello, pieno di animali di ogni specie, molto grande e con tante attrazioni (far mangiare le giraffe, camminare nella gabbia dei canguri, spazzolare le caprette). Ricordo che faceva veramente caldo, quindi portate un berretto e tanta acqua ghiacciata. Ottimo anche il punto ristorazione dello Zoo, i prezzi erano abbordabili quindi potete tranquillamente fermarvi per il pranzo e poi ripartire.< /Text><user>108815780648424803610</user><GmapID>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6< /GmapID>< Pictures>

<text>(Translated by Google) Wow! I visited this place 6 year ago and The last weekend, the different is amazing! They still fixing some areas but the place for lions and Africans species is really beautiful. The animal are well care and they have a large spaces. Prices are reasonable for entrance but if you want to feed the animal. You have to pay 5 dollars per 3 pieces of lettuce for 🦒 and 6 dollars for the dinosaurs tour. The place for birds are nice to look exactly like jungle. Just one thing to observation: they don't respect disability conditions people or caregivers! San Diego and los angels zoo don’t charge anything if you are helping to people with wheelchair!
I visited this place six years ago and this weekend I was in for a big surprise! The renovations and arrangements for the African animal area is very nice and big! They are still fixing other areas but you can still enjoy some animals! The animals are well cared for. And they look great! Prices are reasonable for entry but you have to pay $ 5 to get three lettuce leaves and feed the giraffes and $ 6 for the dinosaur tour! If you bring dependent or disabled people, do not wait for them to have redoeto or consideration with them or with the caregivers! In other places people who require wheelchairs only pay their entrance and the caregivers or caregivers are exempt from the payment but this zoo does not! If you have plans to visit the place, I suggest you wait for the repairs to finish! Parking costs $ 5 but axle plate cars do not pay! Very good for this consideration!

Visite este lugar hace seis años y este fin de semana me encontré con una gran sorpresa! Las renovaciones y arreglos para el area de los animales africanos es muy bonita y grande!  Todavía están arreglando otras áreas pero aún  puedes disfrutar de algunos animales!  Lis animales están bien cuidados. Y se ven muy bien! Los precios son razonables para la entrada pero tienes que pagar 5 dólares para obtener tres hojas de lechuga y alimentar a las jirafas y 6 dólares por el tour de los dinosaurios! Si llevar personas dependientes o con deshabilitases no esperes a que tengan redoeto o consideración con ellos ni con los cuidadores!  En otros lugares las personas que requieren sillas de ruedas solo pagan su entrada y lis cuidadores o caregivers están excentos del pago pero este  zoológico no!  Si tienes planes de visitar el lugar te sugiero que  esperes a que terminen las reparaciones!  El estacionamiento cuesta 5 dólares pero los carros con  placa axil no pagan !  Muy bien por esta consideración!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

(Translated by Google) There are several areas closed for remodeling and works, even so it is worth it after so much time in lockdown, it has all the hygiene and safety measures due to the pandemic. Kids love it.

<name>Marco C.<//name><Text>(Translated by Google) We were traveling from San Francisco to Exeter to visit the Sequoia National Park and, to break the long journey, we decided to stop in Frasno and visit the Zoo. It was never more appropriate choice! Really beautiful, full of animals of every species, very large and with many attractions (to eat giraffes, walk in the cage of kangaroos, brush the goats). I remember it was really hot, so bring a hat and plenty of ice water. Great food also point to the zoo, the prices were affordable so you can safely stop for lunch and then leave.

Eravamo in viaggio da San Francisco a Exeter per visitare il Sequoia National Park e, per spezzare il lungo viaggio, abbiamo deciso di fermarci a Frasno e visitare lo Zoo. Mai scelta fu più azzeccata! Veramente bello, pieno di animali di ogni specie, molto grande e con tante attrazioni (far mangiare le giraffe, camminare nella gabbia dei canguri, spazzolare le caprette). Ricordo che faceva veramente caldo, quindi portate un berretto e tanta acqua ghiacciata. Ottimo anche il punto ristorazione dello Zoo, i prezzi erano abbordabili quindi potete tranquillamente fermarvi per il pranzo e poi ripartire.< /Text><Date>1575888700170< /Date><Gmap_id>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6</Gmap_id><userid>108815780648424803610</userid></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) Magnificent zoo. Especially the area of ​​Africa. At the moment it relaxes you, much better than any massage! Magnificent views from the restaurant. We arrived at 12pm until 4pm. Just to see it all.
Very easy to get to from anywhere in the city by public transport.
Ideal if you have a few hours left in Fresno and you don't know what to do.
Ideal for children.

(Original)
Magnífic zoo. Especialment la zona d'africa. Al moment et relaxa, molt millor que qualsevol massatge! Magnifiques vistes desde el restaurant. Vam arribar a les 12h fins les 16h. Justet per a veure-ho tot.
Molt fàcil d'arribar desde qualsevol part de la ciutat amb transport public.
Ideal si et sobren unes hores a Fresno i no saps que fer.
Ideal per anar amb nens.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The price is pretty high. But I saw that the animals z. B. from Africa have a much larger enclosure than in other zoos. The animals do not look as if they are feeling bad or missing something.
I had fun at the zoo and I recommend it to anyone who has children ...

(Original)
Der Preis ist ziemlich hoch. Aber ich habe gesehen dass die Tiere z. B. aus Afrika ein viel größeres Gehege haben als in anderen Zoos. Die Tiere sehen auch nicht so aus als ob es ihnen schlecht geht oder es ihnen an etwas fehlt.
Ich hatte Spaß im Zoo und ich empfehle es jeden weiter der Kinder hat...</Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) An absolute dream zoo. We paid $ 25 for 2 adults. For parking 7 dollars. The zoo is clean and bigger than I expected. In addition, a lot is offered. There are many walk-in halls. Most animals have a presentation. For a small surcharge, you can stroke rays or feed giraffes. The food in the park is good and the price is fair. The stretches for the animals are big and beautiful.

Ein absoluter Traum Zoo. Wir haben für 2 Erwachsene 25 Dollar bezahlt. Für das Parken 7 Dollar. Der Zoo ist sauber und grösser als ich erwartet habe. Zudem wird einem viel Geboten. Es gibt viele begehbare Gehäge. Zu den meisten Tieren gibt es eine Präsentation. Gegen einen kleinen Aufpreis kann man Rochen streicheln oder Giraffen füttern. Die Verpflegung im Park ist gut und der Preis fair. Die Gehäge für die Tiere sind gross und schön.</review>< response>

(Translated by Google) It is a zoo in Fresno. Animals are housed here as a "safari". We have been here for the second time and there is still a lot to offer.

(Translated by Google) The park is beautiful, has a lot of space, children and puppies have a lot of fun. Well, we all have fun. The only thing that worries me is that I saw homeless people.

(Translated by Google) Horrible do not come there is nothing to see and part everything is super expensive ... they charge as if it were 5 dollars the entrance to the park 15 per adult and 9 per child and part buy drinks and food super expensive a mini pizza $ 10 ... hopefully someone regulate this because they speculate on prices

(Original)
Horrible no vengan no hay nada que ver y a parte todo esta super caro... cobran como si fuera 5 dolares la entrada al parque 15 por adulto y 9 por niño y a parte comprar bebidas y comida super caro un mini pizza $10 ... ojala alguien regule esto porque especulan con los precios<//review>
