Fiji Honey<//user_name>
<text>I recommend the Loco Moco burger with beef marrow gravy! If you know how bone marrow sauce is made, you know the chef put some effort into it and this gravy is quite similar. It's definitely not your typical burger. It won best burger on the L.A. Times 20'. I don't eat spam bacon so I removed it. We also ordered the honey yellow tail and that was just as good, but in a different  way. It wasn't particularly sweet due to the ginger and miso flavors. The ambiance was perfect and the lighting inside is very warm and inviting. Our server was very knowledgeable and helped us decide on drinks because they have a variety of drinks to choose from. On the down side, the drinks are mostly on the sweet side and the ones that are not sweet are amazingly small, but delicious. My only criticism is that some drinks are $14 and you get less than 4 ounces of liquid. Yes, I know! That's a lot for a drink that small. I recommend the Botanical Thyme if you want something refreshing. Also, due to their limited space, expect to wait up to 1 hour outside with no seats so you feel like you are in Disneyland waiting in line. Guests with reservations also have to wait to be seated - not as long though, about 10 minutes.< /text><gmapID>0x80dcd7d79b5200a7:0x7fd343e6dd924e8</gmapID></record>

<review>Spectacular ambiance, with phenomenally crafted cocktails, leaves a recipe for a grade A Tiki bar and Restaurant!

Always, always, always, a great time when I visit, friends, family, or date, the artistically well crafted scenery of a ship wrecked paradise awaits anyone that wants to bask in it's glory.

Top cocktails, Southeast Spice Trade (if your a bourbon fan), Zombie king (if you want that classic tiki experience, and Tarocolada (for that exotic classic drink you can't make at home!).

Service is great, everyone is super courteous and welcoming. There is a lot of pride that goes into the effort each member of the staff puts into creating an awesome experience.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPysrzNroSg_FSr4-m9SwAkbIk9R42sE8dwakMD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dcd7d79b5200a7:0x7fd343e6dd924e8< /gmap_id></record>

I feel the need to make sure this review is in google maps as well. Lol.

Okay let me start with: this review is long overdue. And I actually almost don't want to write it coz I don't want to share this hidden gem. LOL. But this place is just too awesome, they deserve to be recognized. It's not just the atmosphere that we love - tiki theme. The food here is soooo good, it's addicting! I think we've become regulars. Our favorite is the loco moco burger. It's super juicy! And the combination of flavors just go so well together, I can't explain it but from the gravy to the spam to the bun and the egg it's just all on point! Oh and those fries! Just the right amount of kick to it! And even with a huge portion of serving, we inhale the food so fast coz it's just that good! We've tried a couple of their drinks too. I actually can't remember what the ones on the pictures are, but doesn't matter, they're all good. The flavor profiles of their food and drink are all praise worthy to us. That's why we keep on coming back!

Also the people here are the friendliest. They really are so nice, you can tell they want their customer to have a great experience. And they seem to really like their work and it's not that common to find an establishment with staff that are passionate and proud of their work. Oh! Last note, if you see a long line at the restaurant or you're placed on a long hold over the phone, and you get impatient and get the urge to just cancel your plan, don't! Be patient! It's worth it!< /Text>

<text>Great tiki bar with awesome staff. My husband and I stopped in on a Monday night, sitting at the bar, and ended up chatting with the bartender, I think his name was Ash(?). The staff was fast, courteous, and tolerated lots of questions about the drinks. We even got a few tastes of off menu syrups and infused liquor which was awesome. Will definitely be going back and really enjoyed the ambiance and drinks. Try the Three Dots and a Dash - it is delicious, complex, and deceptively boozy!<//text>< UserId.>

Frequent visits - amazing drinks, great food and excellent staff.  Monthly changing menu, which makes coming back exciting as well.  Always something to enjoy.  They’ve also followed COVID19 policies and orders quite well, so they are definitely worthy of the support.< /review>

Just stopped by for their curbside pickup. It was meticulously prepared and ready to go. Their drinks are fantastic! I would highly recommend the Buzzn' Jungle Bird which is very unique tiki drink with its coffee infused campari. I can't wait until they are open again for in-person drinks, as the atmosphere is excellent, as well as their cocktails. As for now, order online and pick up a cocktail for two, you won't be disappointed.< /review>

<Text>The main goal of any bar is escapism, to transport you from your daily life to a place where the world's weight is lifted from your shoulders -- and tropical bars, even more so. Well, even in COVID times, Strong Water still does this to a T! Their small outdoor setup was done so well, good service, everything touchless, no compromise in the drink quality. Highly recommended, now, or once we regain some normalcy.< /Text><Time>1601018661748<//Time>< user_name>

Strong Water was fun! Wish you could stay longer than 2 hours because between the strength of the drinks and the food you really want to relax awhile. Great service from the bartenders and wait staff. If Ash is there, try for an off menu specialty (hint hint, it's a play on his name). Mussels are a must. Crabby mushrooms, too. Tales of the Black Lagoon is a new fave drink. The Saturn is also a must try. Captain's Daughter is weirdly refreshing. Pictured: mussels, Captain's Daughter, Taro Colada< /text>

Excellent, new tiki. Get the fries, they're perfectly fried with amazing seasoning. The burger was delicious, though messy. As for the drinks, the Zombie King was spectacular. All drinks I tried were solid, but the Zombie King was really above them all. They've stolen Ash from Trader Sam's, so you know the drinks will only get more refined over time. As for the atmosphere, it can't be beat. Deeply immersive, perfect lighting. They created a whole world in this small little nook of a bar.< /Text>

Very cool speakeasy near Disneyland in Anaheim. The ambiance is nice with low lighting. Their drinks are the best thing they have! So delicious and so beautiful. They have food options as well if you are looking for a bite to eat. I have tried their glass noodles which are similar to a pad Thai. Great/quick service.<//text>

<text>This was a pleasant experience. It feels like you're on a deserted Island with addicting polenisian music playing in the background. The way the location is set up, it feels like you are on a different  country. I would definitely  recommend the one of a kind drinks. nothin like this in the greater Los Angeles  area. The bartenders are so inviting Wow love these guys. Drew was the best. His descriptions of our food and drinks were on point. Definitely will be back!!</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJLPKt10qnC92M6VLCjKIqI9SLXAxykZOwVGVc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1Ac7brUunt1K6CLTf-U0cQkS1hBGFB8l00Vji=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvRaFMnHSow_-NlfgLgHp2CB0Y59jhXGH2UQr9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMg95NgXgMNUhTCMdNe3LZzvMOt6vciCjeIWqXe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><rate>5</rate><resp>None<//resp>< name>

<text>What a cool place! Great cocktails that compliment Strong Water’s unique vibe. The food was also delicious and paid homage to some Asian and Hawaiian classics like Spring Rolls, Glass Noodles, and Loco Moco. The theming was fun and lots of attention was paid to details of the decor. Definitely looking forward to returning soon.< /text><resp>None<//resp>< user_id>

I was able to make it to the soft opening last night, and I was impressed. Even with a limited menu and a constant flow of customers this tiki bar is definitely ship shape. The crew is friendly and helpful with drink or food choices and will even give you a tour of the ship.

You can even get reservations for the Captains Quarters, a gin bar that is behind a heavy door. Once again they did not hold back with the decor and it helps keep you immersed in the tale of of this vessel.

I highly recommend you check it out if you enjoy tiki bars, theam bars or craft cocktails.</Review>

Went for the soft open and was blown away. Amazingly crafted interior, knowledgeable and welcoming staff, and delicious food and libations. Make sure you get the Moco Loco Burger, the levels of umami in the burger are outstanding. For cocktails, highly recommend the Taro Colada, and if you love coffee liquor, the Buzzin Jungle Bird (which came with the option to purchase the special design Collin's glass).

We have been wanting to pay them a visit and heard good things, but definitely better than we anticipated. We only tried thier sipping santa pop-up, but by far the best one we had been too. The drinks were amazingly different than the other pop-up and were WAY MORE DELICIOUS!! Also had notice the pricing on the mugs were different as well, they are less expensive here than at other pop-ups in so cal. We cant wait to come back and try thier regular menu!!
The other thing we enjoyed was the awesome decor, it's like being in the belly sunken ship. They went all out on the interior and it shows. We enjoyed our seats at the bar and chatted it up with the bartenders that really knew thier stuff when it comes to a premium drink or say a craft cocktail.<//Text>

<Text>Just stopped by for their curbside pickup. It was meticulously prepared and ready to go. Their drinks are fantastic! I would highly recommend the Buzzn' Jungle Bird which is very unique tiki drink with its coffee infused campari. I can't wait until they are open again for in-person drinks, as the atmosphere is excellent, as well as their cocktails. As for now, order online and pick up a cocktail for two, you won't be disappointed.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<text>My husband and I came here on a date night and it is a cool new spot. I strongly recommend getting reservations if you are going on a Saturday night, we were able to get in but we did wait in line for quite a while. The menu is pretty pricey but it's a really cool concept. We sat in the Juniper Merchant area which was lucky because the main bar area looked totally crammed which tends to bother me when people are on top of each other at tables. All and all a good experience, the drinks we had were good and the fries were amazing but if we had been in the main area I think it would have been a bit too crammed.</text><Rating>4< /Rating><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

<Text>This place was fantastic! The vibe was perfect, you have to make a reservation online and you are booked out for a set amount of time. Loved the decor and from what it sounds like they are constantly improving. The drinks are not exactly traditional tiki but fever drink I had was delicious. The food was also great. The staff is incredibly attentive and being a freshly opened bar they were looking for feedback on how to improve. I would definitely give this place a go. You need to make a reservation on their website which is slightly confusing if you're looking for a phone number. They also have a second gin bar that I'm keen to check out.<//Text><Rate>5</Rate></record>

We have been wanting to pay them a visit and heard good things, but definitely better than we anticipated. We only tried thier sipping santa pop-up, but by far the best one we had been too. The drinks were amazingly different than the other pop-up and were WAY MORE DELICIOUS!! Also had notice the pricing on the mugs were different as well, they are less expensive here than at other pop-ups in so cal. We cant wait to come back and try thier regular menu!!
The other thing we enjoyed was the awesome decor, it's like being in the belly sunken ship. They went all out on the interior and it shows. We enjoyed our seats at the bar and chatted it up with the bartenders that really knew thier stuff when it comes to a premium drink or say a craft cocktail.</Text>

Great atmosphere and very friendly staff. Has different areas with different themes (tiki area, captains quarters of a ship, etc. Rooms are on their website). Was just passing by so only had a quick tour of the place (shout out to the super hospitable/informational doorman), but definitely plan on going back to sample the menus! Has the same owners as the blind rabbit (packing district speakeasy), so I'm sure the full experience will be great.<//Review>

<review>I love that Anaheim has its very own tiki bar!  Must check it out!  The drinks were so good!  The food is Asian fusion-poutine fries, moco loco burger, etc.  it’s pretty pricey! Keep that in mind. I was hoping this would be a new regular spot but at $13-15 a drink that’s not feasible. :(
Still check it out, stop in on payday or for a special occasion.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOU2XBchsO4LDAf233TEQdcf9gCH4a7EVEH9tT4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Name>

“Give us a chance to work the kinks out”
Most pretentious place in Anaheim and the launch lineup of drinks were very bad.<//review>

They only had a limited menu for the soft opening but our drinks were delicious and so was the banana bread dessert. Good times, good vibes, and good drinks.</review>

<Review>We were there on a Thursday evening around 7pm and it was full. Was lucky enough to get 2 seats. Especially as we were from out of town and weren't going to have a chance to come back. We were greeted by a very friendly and energetic women upon entering. She did a great job chatting us up while our seats were being put together. The decor is nautical themed and not strictly tiki but very well done and put together. Really enjoyed the water feature at the back (as pictured). The menu is a nice blend of original tiki style cocktails mixed with classic tiki drinks with their own subtle twists, not to mention if asked they will make off menu drinks if the ingredients are stocked and the recipe is at hand. Both bar staff that night were chipper and having fun, which makes it a even better experience. Currently they did not have a house tiki mug but was told it is in the works. However that being said they do carry glassware with logo and designed by B.Rex. The food was very good as well and came out pretty quickly.  They also have a semi hidden/secret bar in the back which is reservations only as it only holds about 12 people and is a Gin bar. Also very nice decor. Sad they didn't have a Tiki mug and as were from canada it will be hard to get back to get one, but if we are ever back in Anaheim we will for sure be back.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8BULM1CpUnuWMXtLu-dHDPhq4N-IG3tNhkn_x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

Get yourself a reservation stat.  The attention to detail here is second only to the wonderful staff and owners.  Proper tiki drinks and tasty bites.  The venue may be new, but the bar has a rich backstory if you ask.</text>

Came on a Tuesday afternoon, food was old and had mixed tastes, such as chicken had a seafood flavor. Owners need to fix. Won't be returning any time soon. Picture shows two types of broccoli - one fresh and the other most likely a day old mixed in the plate I was served. This place should be ashamed, OC health inspector needs to pay this place a visit. Stay away on slow days.<//Text>

<text>Pretty crappy place. No AC inside, cups of water were warm until we asked for ice, food is bland and tates like it's loaded with salt, doesn't feel clean inside.

My girlfriend spat out her food. She couldn't even eat it. Avoid if you can.<//text>< pics>

Surprises skeptics of Mall food. I came here because I was craving Chinese food and all the other places were closed or closing already. I had a a list of dishes that I wanted and they were not on the overhead list offering. I showed my list to one of the servers. They said they have most of them and I told them that I needed to feed 5 hungry people. They took care of what I wanted and they even gave extra food and condements without higher prices.
The eaters were making comments of great taste and wondered if I went to an expensive restaurant.
The prices were more than reasonable for "fast food restaurant".  The workers were very friendly and extra nice. I even gave them a well deserved tip.< /Text>

<Review>Would give this place 0 stars if possible. The food is trash and tastes super old. I can tell the chicken is low quality from the beginning and nothing really tastes like anything. The noodles are super soft because theyre old and have absorbed all the gross sauce they put on it. Do not go here, go to any place in the outlet mall besides here, it will make you sick. This place needs a new look and menu or it needs to be closed down. Panda Express is 100 times better than here.< /Review>< Pictures>

They have brown rice and veggies (broccoli, carrots, cabbage) for those of us that don't like greasy sides. Not very fresh tasting. The teriyaki chicken was ok.<//Text>

Bad service, flavorless, over priced. Why is this place here. Don’t “try” it.

Only if I can rate this place a 0 ! Because I came by to explore this place 2 days ago trying to find the cheapest place to eat at and decided to go to this one hoping it would be better than the chinese food in L.A. here. Sadly I got disappointed by this place $8 for a one item plate really? And the food wasnt even that good I've tasted better Chinese food around town and much freshly cook than this place. It is sad to say that they use leftovers and cook it with the fresh batch and just mix it up in there... which I find gross.. The orange chicken I had way to much flour and chow mein was greasy and tasted old the eggroll was to greasy as well.. Its sad to say that this place is open its disgusting and disappointing so dont even bother stop coming here. UNLESS you want to get a stomachache!<//Text>

When they brought out my dog, I didn’t recognize him for a split second 😂 I took him to work and within hours I had someone ask me where he was groomed ❤️ I proudly told them Dirty Dogs, called the location and booked her an appointment 🤗

Unfortunately, when I picked him up I was in such a rush and I didn’t get a chance to thank the staff appropriately.
Thank YOU staff  and Soul (I think the groomer) at Torrey Hills you guys are amazing and Friday will be back!!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<review>Awesome facility! Super friendly employees. We used the self wash for our dog while visiting and it was perfect. For $18 we got shampoo, conditioner, brushes, deshedding tools, ear cleaning solution, aprons, and towels. The tubs are just the right height so you don't have to bend over the whole time. I definitely recommend Dirty Dogs if you're in the area.< /review>< pictures>

<text>Great service and the friendliest staff! Ashley did an amazing job grooming my little maltipoo - she was very matted but she dematted her beautifully! The gentleman at the front desk was so friendly and personable (I can’t remember his name).

This place is amazing! The sales team is passionate and friendly. They carry a variety of healthy dog foods, and also have the joint supplement we use for our Cane Corso puppy. We wouldn't go anywhere else.</Review>

<Text>Love the grooming or the convenient location but the scheduling process is so incredibly poorly managed. I've been taking my dog here for grooming for years and every time I bring her in for her appointment I never know whether the appointment will be honored, will have magically disappeared from the system, or will have somehow been switched from a haircut appointment to only a wash with no haircut. The online booking system is equally as bad as the phone-based booking.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

They don’t practice safe social distancing at this location! They had their staff stacked on one another. The receptionist was extremely rude to me and my four year old daughter. She even snapped at the groomer who clearly had nothing to do with this scheduling issue. My puppy came out amazing.< /Review>

Went to the Torrey Hills location for the first time on a Saturday for a dog grooming (10lbs maltipoo). They had SUPER friendly staff and they only took 1.5 hours when everywhere else I’ve taken my child keeps her for at least 3 hours. They gave her the best cut ever and I could tell they took great care of her. Very pleased with this business and will continue to go!</text>

Nice staff and affordable grooming options. Make sure to pay ahead of time or while your dog is being groomed. This location keeps treats stored at puppy level no protection right at checkout.</text>

I have a very wiggly, sassy GSD and they always do a wonderful job helping me trim/dremmel her nails. They all have the patience of a saint which, trust me, is needed with my dog! We are always received with a warm welcome and they are kind to us even when my dog gets over excited and wants to jump on them and lick their faces which I know is something not every human enjoys (we are working on it).</Text>

We have been loyal customers for 4 years. On March 1st of this year,  they  suddenly raised their prices for a small dog wash and haircut from $69 to $79.  We asked that our dog get the traditional miniature schnauzer cut, but when I picked him up, he had just been buzz-cut:  very short all over.  So the result is one of going from a good business to an incompetent one, and charging 14% more !  They've lost our business.<//Text>

Great store, great staff, great place. Our pups have had both professional and do-it-yourself grooming here. Well, the do-it-yourself was a bath. The staff is very helpful and friendly. When dogs go in for grooming, they hangout in the grooming area as a pack, no cages. The dogs seem as happy as the people. Especially cool is that there is a dog park above the parking lot so you can let the little ones get tuckered out before going in for their baths. Highly recommended.<//Review>

I love dirty dogs and so do my two 100 lb black labs! This is a community minded store and they go out of their way to make sure the customer has the best experience. I often use the self wash (for the dogs, not me) and the staff or always keen to give me a helping hand. All around good feeling when you go to this store!< /review>

<text>Great customer experience. I went to wash my 90 lb German Shepherd and they were so helpful and sweet-- definitely animal lovers! The facilities are clean and modern, the shop is cute, with lots of boutique-y items and high-end products. I didn't use the groomer here, just the wash-your-own option and I loved it. I've since moved, and this is no longer convenient, but if I hadn't-- I would be here regularly. Awesome experience.</text>< rating>

<Text>Brought our dog here a bunch of times and can't say anything but stellar service and staff. Even if we can't pick her up right after a grooming they make it a fun environment and I know she's in good hands.

Update 1/26/18: let's just say that for a 5lb dog at $60 is completely ridiculous and when we include the standard services like anal glands and such they never get done. Service has gone down, staff never wants to make it right. Unfortunate for the franchise.< /Text>< Pics>

I sent my sister there and now she is completely grommed and raised. Now she is so groomed that she sent her son there. Just imagine that a dog sent its son( puppy) there. And now her son is so groomed that he uses INSTAGRAM with the name of waqar something bla bla, and Besty raised him so greatly, that now, that dog likes my daughter picture. There is no doubt that he is a dirty dog< /Review>

Took me in with out an appointment that was the good part but the price for a full set was in believable 80 dollars.  Wow never in my life paid that much I did have anything special done. Way to pricey.  But they also switch you off to another person to finish off I don't like that either. I like one person to do the whole job. Anyway learnt lesson here. They were a nice couple.  And friendly. And that's what the stars are for.</text>

<Review>Honestly, I don't think I'm ever going to go to another salon. I was so blown away at the beautiful work Ann did. The nails are a little fatter, and not so thin. She soaked my older nails off instead of pulling them off (which I hate). She listened to everything I wanted, and was just a wonderfully pleasant woman.

If you need a new nail salon, come here. I cannot say enough good things about them.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1PBB1LRSTFYyPtws-7cCkVG_vsjXZ7S3XPbuT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKjYEC3GrVDSxe3Hd_GEHls5oFK056a9AX2MQe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

The place is clean the staff is beyond nice. I did not feel rush at all. They get busy so it’s best to make an appointment, they also do walk in but I am sure it will be a bit of a wait .

< review>
The lady that did my nails started with an A. First off I asked for the old set to be removed.. They ripped them off taking my real nail with it.  I asked if they can be soaked instead which she did but only grinded the fake nail down and did not removed them. They are lumpy and each nail has a different size.  I paid $45 for crap and my nails hurt way to much to go back to get them fixed.  My advise  is to slow down! I've attached pictures which don't do the justice of how bad they look.<//review>

Been going here for over 15 years! I always get great service and I am VERY picky about my nails. The late Sunday hours are a big plus with my schedule. Plus I get to support a female owned small business in my neighborhood.</Text>

<username>Tina Sperber</username><time>1402361000931< /time><Review>I had been seeing Peter for a very long time when out of the blue when attempting to make an appointment I was told Peter was on vacation.  Ann assured me Peter would return in two weeks and told me she would be so happy to fill my nails in Peter's absence.  Ann was LYING, and I should tell you that she is the only woman filling nails in the salon in case you're wondering who the last reviewer saw.  Peter is never returning to this establishment however, I am delighted to report that I have found him.  He is on the south/west corner of Soledad & Sierra next to the Pizza Hut.  I received a magnificent spa pedicure at an unbelievable price as well as a much needed fill to perfection!! If you're looking for Peter you too may find him at 251-3186.</Review>< GmapID>

Had her wax my eye brows waxed here and I live local so it was convenient to go there and get it done. But a huge mistake! 😠 Because now I'm going to have to wait for three to four weeks or more to grow out me eye brows? Both are now completely uneven and look like two different eyebrows now. If I could seriously give zero stars for a rating, I would! But it requires at least one star. Avoid them at all cost! They're too stupid and careless to be in business. They're absolutely the worst and need their license pulled! I would always have to tell her how to do it and she would get offended???
She shouldn't be offended says I'm a customer. Her and her boyish girlfriend are not even legal here...
I'm calling the Better Business Bureau. Anybody else who has a problem should also. We can get them shut down if we all call. I had her offer discounts to give her a 5 star rating and begged me not to say anything bad about her poor work. I have also heard her say this to other people. In one case I know she did a girl's nails free and her sisters nails for free.
Most of their ratings are by their friends anytime they get five star. If you look at the scale they never get 2,3, or 4 Stars, it's either 1 Star mostly... the few 5 star ratings she gets her boyfriends of hers that she gives big discounts or does free work for.
If this is all she does by trade, then she has absolutely no Talent at all! I'll say it again, avoid her at all costs! Better to pay more and get it done right then to Pay less and be unhappy.</text>< Pics>

<Text>The service was horrible. They screwed up my cousins nails and made her cry when it was their fault. And in seeing that my cousin was crying, they didn't even try to make her feel better. Instead, they proceeded to tell her that it was her fault for not telling them how she wanted her nails when we had specifically told the lady to do her nails a certain way when we first got there and reminded the lady again before my cousin got her nails done. They don't do it the way you want it done. Instead, they tell you how you should get them done. Which is fine whatever recommend all you want but telling someone exactly how to get their nails done is a huge no.<//Text></record>

<Text>Very tasty sauces! The chicken is real, not like Mc nuggets. Prices are decent and service is friendly. The best part is you can choose your tender, delicious wings with over 10 different sauces depending on how spicy you want them. Also, you get to choose bone-in...or boneless! Great chicken for about$10 a person. 👍 👍<//Text>< Pics>

Twice in the last week...and outstanding service. Mgr was making sure the employees were greeting guests as they walked in...today an employee was putting up Valentine deco and handed out Valentine's to each guest..very nice. Glad to see we have a business in town with great management🇺🇸<//Text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><text>Always been a wing lover, and this is the place to get it. A little slow, but the wings are really good. Always get Original Hot and Cajun. And if you're wondering the Atomic wings are pretty spicy! Had them twice and the first time they were spicy-ish, but just had them yesterday again and they caked the sauce on and it was really spicy! Very good though.<//text><rating>5</rating><username>Lourde Gourde< /username><gmap_id>0x80ec1f4c26bd2d1b:0xd89472ce76c028b7<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Online order took 35 minutes, fries and lemon pepper very under seasoned, fries undercooked, no napkins or wet wipes. Have had much better In Arizona and Michigan locations.

But, staff was very friendly and apologetic on wait, wings were hot and fresh and ranch was good as always.<//text>

Good food at affordable prices.  The 25 piece family meal for ~$25 was more than enough to feed my family of four.  We enjoyed the lemon pepper wings.  This location offers a 10% military discount.<//review>

Excellent fries, good customer service. Similar to, but better than Buffalo wild wings.  I wish they had a honey BBQ, or a sweet BBQ sauce.</Review>

Love the wings and fries here, but the service is a little slow. I'd recommend ordering online before you show up and wait in line. It's a popular place for a reason the food is amazing.< /Review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>It was a center, in the town of Encino. It centered very well, and felt very Encinoesque, I suppose. What can I say, I already reviewed the Yogurtland that I stopped here to visit. Go read that one, it's a real hoot! Really riveting stuff, quite compelling is what I wrote about that Yogurtland. Yep, nothing to see here...why are you still reading this? Seriously, I've nothing more to say about the place. Get a life, yeesh...lol!

Just go for more than waffles. People are showing up with the free birds. Try not to sit at the end and food size is wonderful and worth it</review>

<Review>A large, multi-story shopping mall located on both the North and South sides of Ventura Boulevard. There are two national chain stores, Petco and Michael's. In the lower level is a multi-screen movie theater. There are several restaurants throughout the facility.

Parking on the North side of Ventura Boulevard is located behind the stores. There is underground and above ground parking South of the boulevard. Parking is wheelchair accessible and free. The multi-story structure has an elevator. Underground parking puts your car on the same level as the movie theater. A very comfortable garden, with seating is also located in the lower level.

Located on the North side, behind an unamarmed door is Menchie's Yogurt School. The store in front has a delicious selection of their products.</Review><time>1574713396762<//time><Resp>None< /Resp><user_id>111644673136196029337<//user_id><Name>Cary Brown</Name><gmapID>0x80c29836712d394b:0xcbc89923f834d018</gmapID></record>

< Review>
Horrible! Gave us the run around for 2 weeks as we are trying to move states kept stating we only had to do one more thing every day, then once we were actually in Cali hoping to get moved in we were told that “unfortunately we weren’t approved because our income comes from unemployment” when we had been told everyday for weeks that it was fine. The woman here did not want to help us had me and my boyfriend calling everyone for information they needed. I work for a rental Agency and have never in my life had to deal with a property who didn’t want to rent to people as much as this</Review>

My move in was pretty good. Jourdan was Great and helped us get in quickly. She was very nice and professional during this process. My wife and myself really like living here and it is a Quiet place to come home to. The amenities seem very good and we will enjoy using them once Covid restrictions are lifted. We have only been here 3 weeks and all is good except for one thing that caught us by surprise and was quite embarrassing for myself and my wife not to mention a little uncomfortable.
Let me try to explain. We have a dog, and every morning I get up early to walk my dog before leaving for work. sometimes I walk within the gated community and sometimes outside the gates. One particular morning my wife and I decided to walk our dog outside the gates and walked to the parking lot of the Metro train station which is literally a few feet from our gated community. We were not there more then 5 minutes before the Metro train security yelled at us to get off there property, I do realize this has nothing to do with Metro Gateway but this sets the scene to what comes next. After being harassed by Metro Train security even as we were walking on the sidewalk(city Property), towards our gated community we we then being talked to from what sounded like a loud speaker telling us to move away from the gates or the police would be called. At this point we felt humiliated and embarrassed. Felt like we were unwelcome at the very place we call home. The loud speaker was actually mounted on the Metro Gateway apartments and we were told to leave like common trespassers. Hello, we live here and the fact that we used our gate code to get in should have been a clue to that fact.
Hopefully this was an isolated incident but time will tell.</Review>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Please do not move into this apartment complex!  We wish we could move out but have not been able to due to COVID.  This apartment has  multiple issues, first our car got broken into and all the management service did was send a memo saying that lock your cars. There are no cameras, no security , and most of the time the homeless population walks in and can be found going through the trash.
Secondly, our upstairs neighbors have flooded our ceiling twice! And no consequences, we have had to deal with holes in our ceilings, with a dehumidifier while the assistant manager will tell you that she "understands what you are going through because she went through it too" With no actual helpful suggestions. We will be moving out as soon as we are able to but wish we had gone with metro gateway apartments off Main street, not only it has great restaurants nearby but there parking situation is much better.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNl_-8A23xprn-z0_SXfRlFBO6-7xCTX3FCU7px=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLM4zj2KcSQtdtKHdky__zbmU3-DO1utnk1jBF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDCy8duissb2rjdMwuiJfi-slr_j2X90GjDxW-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

<text>My family and I moved in to Metro Gateway a little over a month ago. It’s a very nice place; spacious and quiet. However I’ve noticed that the overall upkeep of the entire complex has faltered from the super clean state it was in when my family first moved in. The hallways were pretty much spotless but now there’s stains, trash, and ants roaming around EVERYWHERE. I’m quit sure it’s been difficult to maintain spotlessness during this COVID-19 pandemic though so I’m not bothered. Our first work order was fixed the very next day, I was super impressed but our next three work orders took a month to complete. Every time I called to check on the status I was told they were backed up, which I completely understood during this time, but I was also told ‘it should’ve been fixed by now’. The keys to the gates don’t always work either. Pool is kept clean as well as the gym and BBQ area. The ladies working in the office are incredibly professional! Metro Gateway has exceeded my expectations, even with the problems I experienced, they are simply better than most apartment complexes in every way. Would definitely recommend to friends and family.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

If I knew what a nightmare dealing with the leasing staff here would be, I definitely would have considered moving somewhere elsewhere. Unfortunately, being military, we were across the country when deciding on a place and had to have a place ready to move in upon arrival.

We reserved the this unit over 2 months before move-in day (unit was "move-in ready" at the time of reserving), which one  would think would be more than enough time for the property management to ensure things were good to go on their end, right? Wrong.

Before I even get into that, there were a lot of issues dealing with the electronic move-in documents to sign. That should have been a red flag for us. I was away from my spouse at the time due to temporary duty in another state, so we were receiving all the docs via email individually for each of us to sign seperately. Except for I was, but she wasn't. After multiple requests that she gets the documents resent to her email, and property staff (clearly annoyed with HER) insisting the problem was on her end, turns out THEY put an extra 'L' on '"...@gmail.com". On top of that had we had to re sign multiple leases and welcome letters because they kept putting the wrong dates on all the documents even after multiple calls with them confirming dates. The final lease was eventually signed on move-in day.

Parking here is a nightmare, but thankfully residents have a reserved spot, with the option to pay for another. Except for on the day of our arrival, the garage for my unit had not been set up yet, and they were unsure if there were any other available spots, so we were instructed to park outside of the property until the garage guy was able to program the fob the NEXT WEEK. Again, they knew we were coming for 2 months before move in day... My wife's paid parking spot isn't even on the same property as us. Her spot is outside the property gate, across the street, into their other property gate, and down the lot a ways. Honestly it wouldn't be so bad to park outside the gated property if it wasn't for all the homeless mosying around the area.

The apartment has a really convenient Valet Trash service, where they give you a specific bin to leave outside your door each night and somebody collects the trash for you, that way you don't have to deal with the homeless people constantly going thought the property dumpsters. Sounds pretty cool, except for I wouldn't know. The leasing staff neglected to have a bin ready for us until literally the day of me writing this. We followed up with them a few times about it, but they don't answer the phone 90% of the time, and don't respond to voicemails 100% of the time. When we eventually did get into contact with them they said needed to order a new one for us. Ok, understandable, kind of. But today I give them a call to follow up on it after a couple of weeks, and they have a maintenance guy drop off a filthy used bin that's missing a lid. We don't want a topless trash bin just sitting in our unit but at this point I'm over it. I don't want to deal with calling them anymore for a while.

The unit itself is not so bad honestly, and the property and amenities seem pretty good. It's also in a really convenient area. If you do decide to live here I hope you have a better move in experience than us. Maybe we were just had a series of unfortunate events coincidentally all happen around the same time. I don't know. We've only been here a few weeks so I'm hoping things start getting better.<//text>

The property is beautiful and there are some very nice accommodations.
Simone is great and has been professional, responsive and accommodating with our inquiries and requests from our initial tour to our move-in, and thereafter. Having moved in around March as the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders went into effect, we really got to know the property management team and experienced nothing but compassion and professionalism.

The only thing I hope to be expanded on is the parking situation as it does seem to be very difficult to find guest parking if we want to have visitors. Other than that, we are very happy with our experience so far!<//text>

I've thought very long and hard about writing this review. Moving is always a turbulent time in peoples lives and infinity more so during the COVID pandemic. There are no perfect situations and things happen that are often out of our control. All that being said the metro gateway advertises its self as luxury living or at the very least high end.
This is most certainly not the case. I would not go as far as to call living at the metro gateway an unpleasant experience. For the sake of fairness I shall list the things I have enjoyed about my stay at the metro.
1. My neighbors have been pleasant and kept to themselves. Most of them are younger working men and women or small families both tend to keep to themselves (a plus in a pandemic), but I can say with certainty have all been genuinely nice people.
2. It's conveniently close to lots of my favorite eateries and grocery stores. It is also close to the mall but in a pandemic I will consider this a null factor.
3. The front office is accommodating to new tenets (emphasis on new). My girlfriend and I make our money in a lot of unusual ways. We are both freelancers and don't have traditional income sources, but they allowed us to use bank statements over a long period of time to prove we could afford to live at the metro. This is a level of flexibility you cant find everywhere and was a pleasant process.
4. A diverse population. This may be problematic in some ways but as a first generation American and a minority it puts me to ease seeing such a wide range of backgrounds in my neighbors (this provides value to me specifically so feel free to ignore this point).
and that's about it to be honest. There are a lot of bell and whistles they'll try to dangle in front of you but they're not available due to COVID or are negligible considering the price of rent.
THINGS I DISLIKED/COULD NOT STAND
1. COCKROACHES, COCKROACHES, COCKROACHES. There was a pest infestation because of the grills not being cleaned after being used by others and surprise surprise cockroaches made their way all over the place. The metro did very little to deal with this and I wouldn't be surprised if it was a common occurrence. I despise bugs especially roaches. My apartment is kept clean so why do i have to deal with pests because a luxury apartment cant be bothered to clean the common spaces?
2. HOMELESS PROBLEMS. Look, other people being without a home during a global pandemic in riverside county, that's not a surprise at all. As someone who comes from humble beginnings I empathize with the homeless but they dig through the communal dumpsters and leave garbage everywhere! It's not an isolated incident either the same homeless guy is there every morning around 6am like CLOCKWORK. Honestly this guy might as well be advertised as coming with the place at this point. Save your bottles and cans for him and maybe he wont make a huge mess of your garbage looking for them lmao.
3. There's not enough parking. Parking spaces are assigned so no problem right? There's literally only two guest parking spots though so what could go wrong? Well people park in your assigned spot all the time that's what could go wrong! Food delivery people, UPS FEDX people, random guests, you name it they will take your spot while you're at work or shopping for groceries. Call the tow truck then? You can but it wont stop it from happening over and over and over again. If you like having to deal with the hassle of towing people so you can go home after a long day of work then no big deal, but i'd rather not deal with it.
4. Stuff only sorta works. Parking keyfab? replaced twice in a 6 month period. Smart home system? Doesn't come with the code to use and they don't have the code so congrats on your useless hindrance?
4.2 Maintenance is nice enough but they don't wear masks during a global pandemic and instead of fixing the aforementioned smart home system after it triggered the intruder alarm. Easy fix right? have maintenance reset it. They tore it out of the wall and called it a day.
TLDR: The rent is too high live elsewhere.</Text>

This is addressed to the corporate office. I was a former resident of Metro Gateway and was issued my deposit refund check within a reasonable amount of time. However, after cashing the check I was notified by my bank that it was rejected due to insufficient funds. This is extremely frustrating as I have not been able to get a clear answer from the leasing office and have not been able to get a hold of anybody at the corporate office. I really hope that this does not have to escalate further, and hope to receive my deposit soon. It’s not fair to me or any other former resident because to us, it’s a substantial amount of money being withheld. Anyone from corporate, please contact me immediately.<//Text>

I just moved in a couple days ago, so I haven't been exposed to much of the complex especially due to COVID. However, both Jourdan and Yasmin have been extremely helpful throughout the entire application process and the transition from Texas to California.< /Review>

please do not move into this complex! Overpriced, no parking for guests and homeless people are going through trash and at night are wandering about. No security at all, and gates are non-functioning 50% of the time. want to move out as soon as we are able to buy a house!

I've been living here since the complex has been open (the very beginning). I can say I 100% love my apartment. The amenities and the events the management office puts on are a plus and are usually very fun if you attend them. Brandon and Chris are amazing and have been extremely helpful since I have been living here. Parking for guest hasn't been an issue in the recent months and even more so since they instated the new parking policy. There are transients who frequent the complex dumpster bins but there is little that can be done to deter them other than calling the cops and asking them to leave which I have done myself and Brandon does on a regular basis (I've seen it with my own eyes). As with anywhere you live, there will be pros and cons. I've searched high and low for rental properties in Riverside area, and in my opinion this is the best you'll get for your money. My only suggestion would be to have actual security, instead of a courtesy patrol, and to start fining people for not picking up after their dogs. All in all, I love living here.<//text>

I enjoy living here. Brandon and Kelly were nice and attentive. The gym, pool area and parking lot are kept clean and Chris was quick to respond to any service requests I made. The only negative thing I have to say about living here is that I often see transients digging through the dumpsters and leaving trash everywhere.  Overall, great place to live.<//review>

<Review>DO NOT LIVE HERE. I lived here for 13 months after moving to SoCal from Philly. The original property management company wasnt too bad; the one who took over after 2-3 months of me living there is HORRIBLE.
1. Its a gated complex but there have been multiple garage and car break ins. They have no cameras and no security. Not to mention the homeless people wandering all over the place and digging in the dumpsters.
2. When the new company (Davlyn Investments) took over, they couldnt figure out how to add my info to the gate entryway call box so I could let in people and deliveries. They couldnt "find the instruction manual."
3. The parking situation is a complete joke. There are 4 guest parking spots but they are always taken by the residents who are too cheap to pay for a parking spot.
4. Yes, you need to pay for your parking spots. And they threaten to tow you if you dont. I have never seen a tow truck in the complex. EVER. I had 2 vehicles and a motorcycle. I had to pay for a garage and a parking spot.
5. I accidentally lost my garage door remote. The garages have a way of opening them for maintenance. Well maintenance couldnt get it open and tried telling me that they would have to go into the next garage and cut a hole to get into mine!! And they would have to CHARGE ME for it! I called a lock smith and they had it open in 20 mins for $50 bucks.
6. My ex-girlfriend moved out after 4 months and I had to take her name off the lease. I went through a new approval process to ensure I could afford the apartment and signed all the papers, etc. To this day... they still have her name on my emails and paperwork.
7. COVID 19 hit and the office shut down and so did the pool, gym, etc, but they never lessened our rent since we didnt have all the amenities we were paying for.
8. During COVID 19 my lease ended and I tried to get a hold of the office many times. By phone, by stopping at the office. But no one was ever there or answered. So when I went to put in my official 60 day move out notice I couldnt get a hold of anyone. By the time I got a hold of someone I had to put in a 30 day notice. They tried telling me I still had to pay the next 30 days rent, even though I was completely moved out and cleaned up by 30 days.
9. They say its a no smoking complex... there are cigarettes and weed being smoked everywhere.
10. The pet owners in the complex are disgusting. There have been many times I got on the elevator and there was pee and poop from peoples animals that they never cleaned up. Management just shrugs and says oh well.

This place has beautiful apartments but the management and living situation in the complex are pathetic.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

I had an 18 month lease from December 2018-March 2020.

The good:
Fairly new units with modern floorplan & nice appliances.

The bad:
PARKING!!!! - As you can read in EVERY. SINGLE. REVIEW. since Metro Gateway opened, parking is comical. Each unit is assigned 1 spot (regardless of number of residents) and can purchase an additional spot or garage for $50-100 each month IF there are additional spots available. I tried to get a garage and was put on a waiting list for 9 months. There are 5 guest spots per side of the complex for about 200 units. These spots are occupied 100% of the time by residents (same cars in the spots at all times). You will NEVER be able to have friends over and, if they do come over, they will hate you for the stress of trying to figure the situation out and will never come back. The management will try to tell you they have a new flavor of the month parking policy...(new parking policies were "implemented" 3 times in 18 months and none were ever actually enforced). Because all the guest spots are full, people illegally park in fire lanes and handicap spots daily (sometimes overnight and beyond). Note: When I moved in, the agent told me to just park in the train station when you have guests...Don't do it! Unlike Metro Gateway, they actually have consistent on-site patrol who will write tickets and have vehicles towed.

Management - There was an ownership change to Davlyn that took place about 6 months ago. Previous management was awful about customer service but maintained the property grounds REALLY well. They'd regularly scrub and pressure-wash the hallways, pick up trash in the islands, have crews regularly replace seasonal flowers & mulch, and pick weeds in islands. Maintenance dude was AWESOME - very friendly, attentive, fast, and super thorough! The new staff are more pleasant to deal with but the condition of the property has suffered dramatically. Landscaping and common areas aren't nearly as well-kept as they used to be. Water dispenser was removed from the gym, towels no longer provided, and equipment wipes are always empty. Since they took over, they've had 4 new property managers. We'd get an email or letter introducing us to our new property manager and a week or two later they'd be gone. My last month in the community, my rent did not auto-load in the app, so I called the office and they calculated the total for my final months rent, which I paid that day. Then, I received my move-out statement and their calculation turned out to be a few hundred dollars off so they charged me the difference from my deposit despite it being their (Simone's) clerical error. Also, regardless of the condition of your unit upon move-out, they will charge for paint, carpet, and cleaning...don't waste your time (12hrs) and money ($90) on supplies to clean every spec of dust from the back of the deepest cabinet - it won't matter because they'll assess mandatory charges totaling about $300 (more, I'm sure, if you're a slob).

Terrible residents - The property appears to be somewhat upscale but it's all a facade. If you dare open your windows, you'll get a contact high at any hour of the day because people are endlessly smoking weed in this "no smoking" community - reported countless times with no result. No one cleans up after their pets despite several pet waste stations - urine and smeared dog (I hope) poop in elevators, stairs, walkways, etc. The scrawny wannabe gym bros never clean up after themselves and leave dumbbells, mats, and benches everywhere. Loud music and beer bottles constantly fill the courtyard from authorized and unauthorized gatherings alike.

Pets - My small, older dog was attacked by another (restricted-breed) dog that was not on a leash and had to have surgery (total costs came to around $1,700 in all after follow-up visits). The office staff would not assist us or animal control in locating the owner to pursue legal action against them and their vicious dog.</Text>

I’ve been living here for almost 2 years now and it’s definitely over priced for what it is, I’ve lived in many luxury apartment complexes and this one just looks nice , but you don’t get what your paying for here. Parking is horrendous, they expect you to never have social life with the parking being non existent. homeless are always in the dumpsters, floors look gross including the elevators, (which by the way is the slowest moving elevator I’ve ever been in) and they charge for every little thing that should be complimentary with the high prices they charge. Disappointing because it could have been something great.< /text>

I moved in to Metro Gateway, June 2019.  I was impressed with the apartment package, i.e. appliances, decor, location.  I did have some concerns about how well the property would be kept up, and responsiveness of the management and leasing agents.  The first six months of my tenancy turned out to be a terrible experience.  Poor up keep of the grounds, faliure to enforce basic regulations like no smoking, parking, pet policy etc.  In the time I have been a resident here to date, I have seen the building sell once, six different managers and eight different leasing agents.  There has been no continuity to addressing and resolving property issues.  I am pleased to say that things have finally turned around.  About a month ago the new owners assigned Angela MacAskill as Property Director.  From the first day she arrived, things have steadily improved.  She resolves problems, treats residents with respect, makes hereself available, and follows up with personal e mail whenever there has been a concern.  She has raised the bar for management here.  I also see improvement in the other staff members.  I wish to also recognize Leasing Agent Autumn who also has been very helpful.  Angela has shown that problems can be corrected, and the rental experience can be a positive one.  My hats off to Angela MacAskill for her professional management and a tip of the hat to Davlyn, for having her on staff.  I am giving four out of five stars, there is always room for a bit more improvement.</review>

<date>1573923127822</date><rate>3</rate><review>Our family moved in two months after the second building opened. We were the only family on our floor, very peaceful and super clean. Then, old management I think got bonuses for signing leases to some tenants who trashed the common areas. Now, the stains on the concrete floors from spilled drinks, etc. Can't come out even with power washer. Elevator is constantly dirty with fingerprints and finger drawings; ( are these adults?) Constantly on the stainless steel wall finish. Huge pet issues; ( once found a pool of urine and feces In the elevator with a footprint in it, obviously someone stepped in it). Worse part about it was several tenants used the elevator wall to post their feelings about the issue with taped messages some of which had juvenile / vulgar language written on them. Couple weeks ago we came back to our parking space late at night and three car windows of cars parked around our space we're smashed in. We Ourhad to drive into the parking lot of the other building to notify the two security guards who were sitting in their car. They said they hadn't been notified of incident but we called the Riverside police Dept. And were told that incident had been reported to them but the cars involved had not had their addresses updated on their registrations so they were waiting for the victims to call in. Apartment is nice and modern but the common areas are bad.</review>< pics>

So far so good! I love this community it is relatively new so my experience so far has been positive. If you enjoy young and modern living this is the place. The pricing can be a little more than an average apartment complex within Riverside, but it is defintely worth it!< /Review>

We’ve had numerous problems with this place. First, they never told us when we first moved in that we can’t have more than 2 cars on the premises at a time. They only have 5 guest parking spots on each of the sides and not to mention “residents” can’t park there or they’ll get towed. We have 4 cars and we wouldn’t have moved in if they told us we couldn’t buy more than one extra spot. It’s nowhere in the contract and they’re very rude about it and when we asked where we should park they just say “I don’t know figure it out.”We also pay more than 2,000 dollars a month not including utilities or our parking for terrible customer service, no parking, and no perks. All in all, terrible place to live the guest spots are always filled I can’t have anyone over and terrible service.< /Text>

Great place to live. Brandon was very helpful and made our move in date pretty easy. Community is quiet, calm, and peaceful. Grocery stores and gas stations are with in walking distance or if your in rush and need to get gas you can pull right into the ga station. Very convenient.< /review>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Review>There are many words that can be used to describe this apartment complex but the one that is most applicable is “surprising.”

The apartment itself is quite nice— it was built within the past 5 years and the amenities are very modern and accessible to all residents. It is a gated community that is split into two sides: the side with the main office and the side with all residents. The insides of the apartments are practically brand new and decorated with modern appliances. The ease of accessibility to nearby train stations, public transport, and abundance of stores made these apartments extremely appealing. However, there are many things about this complex that completely invalidate these perks.

To start, the parking situation. As seen by other reviews of this complex, the parking is, for lack of a better word, shit. Each resident is assigned one spot and one spot only. For residents’ guests, there are at most 5 guest spots on each side of the complex. What happens when all guest spots are taken up? Their solution is to have your guests park at the train station right next door; however, parking at the station is technically prohibited and has resulted in warnings and tickets. Attempting to buy another parking spot or even a garage slot is a long and harboring process and seems like the management team wants to work at least as possible in trying to help their residents. They say that their team routinely walks around the complex to check for violations and concerns, but that is not true as there are cars constantly parked in wrong spots or even illegally on red zones.

Another problem: pets. The amount of pet feces in the planters and even on the asphalt is appalling. There have also been accounts of dogs attacking other dogs (pit bulls specifically, which are prohibited in this complex). Again, if there was a team that routinely checks the complexes, then someone should have noticed at some point that there are prohibited dog breeds within their complex. Not to be unfair to the residents who are responsible pet owners, but the ones who let their dogs run around without leashes should not be allowed to reside at this complex.

All in all, I would not recommend this complex to anyone who is trying to move to the Corona/Riverside area. It is a two star review only because the amenities are actually quite nice and the apartments themselves are clean and practically brand new. However, the cons far outweigh the pros with this place. Along with the problems I listed about, the management staff is also extremely hard to reach, harboring multiple emails and calls before receiving a response. It also seems like if you do not live on the side with the front office, the chances of getting their attention are quite low. If it were not for these issues, this would be a place that I would highly recommend. I hope they can address these issues before it affects any more of their current and future residents.</Review>< pics>

Worst place ever to live. No parking, bums in the trash every morning. The elevator is always dirty. Place is way over priced for the perks. Do yourself a favor and move to metro at main in Corona. They have awesome amenities and the parking is the best. This place is a scam.< /Review>

Came in right now to look at an apartment for my mom who is moving from the Bay Area to Riverside to be close to us. Walked in & had the displeasure of dealing with Vanessa who wouldn't even show me an apartment because my mom wasn't here! I've never heard of no foolishness like this. We are pre-screening apartments for her and when we find a place my mom would of come in & filled out all paperwork. Vanessa said she couldn't show me an apartment because I wouldn't be the one who'd be moving in. I told her I had no problem giving her my license to view the property but she rudely said no that's not how it works. Management really needs to train their staff on customer service & lack their lack of.</Review>

<Review>Called to receive some information on the property's pet policy's while I was at work trying to complete a market survey...the leasing consultant was extremely rude...she stated that she was working and could not help me as I could not get the answers from the website.

I would think that she would know answering a few questions on their pet policy if their are any restrictions, pet rent and deposit was part of her job description.

I would never respond to a person in that manner no matter what her position was. Called again right after she hung up and left a voicemail as she probably screened my call. Poor customer service in my opinion.

I wanted to schedule to tour as my family and I are looking for a new place in the next  30+ days. First impressions matter, even if its over the phone.

Update to the response from the owner of Metro Gateway: Thank you for your response but...No matter what, professionalism is very important, it goes a long way.<//Review>< UserId.>

<text>I have lived here since their phase 1 opened August 2017 and I have never had a problem with this place until feb 2018 when new tenants below moved in stating we are loud and noisy. Despite my numerous amounts and attempts to assist in the complaint against me I could not satisfy the tenants below me. I was called by the leasing office time and time again but between conversations I told them I have done everything I can to help ease the noise they are hearing even to a point of not coming home till the late evening with my kids since that was the main complaint. Now feeling like I am being ran out of my own apartment due to the tenants below the leasing off chooses not to contact me about the issue and just ignore the issue yet when the tenants below complain they are so quick to call me . I have had the tenants complain about us just living our lives we stress about how to walk in the apartment or carry a conversation in this apartment just to please the tenants below. I am very angry at the leasing office whom I thought would help but seem to brush this issue to the side. Coming home has been nothing but unpleasant and stressful. This place is not for people who are single going through a divorce with children it will just add to your already stressful situation.</text>< Gmap_id>

The Metrogateway apartments are truly a treasure here in Riverside. The facilities are kept clean, the staff members are friendly, and the apartments are beautiful. There is a state of the art two floor gym, (which is what initially caught my eye) fully equipped with everything you'd need to have a productive workout session. The pool and the hot tub are picture perfect, and exactly what I need to help unwind after long work days. The grills are located next to a fire table, which adds to the overall ambiance and also will help keep you warm on the chillier SoCal nights. The entire facility is Instagram and Snap Chat picture ready, and so if you are a social media enthusiast, you'll appreciate that aspect as well. Since this is a new community, there are still a few minor kinks to be worked out (as expected), but I still rate them 5 stars because the staff members are always ready to help rectify any concern, and to answer any questions to ensure that their residents are happy. I absolutely love it here! If you want to live in a place that will make all of your friends jealous, then this is it! Come see for yourself :).</Text>

My fiancé and I had a wonderful time searching for apartment units with Alisa and Jordan. They were both very patient with us and communicated in an extremely professional manner, as they were always quick to respond. If we ever left voicemails they were sure to call back within 24 hours. We had a great experience so it’s clear that the management is excellent!< /review>

Just bought a 2020 Chevy Silverado. Traded in my 2005 Chevy Silverado. I am very happy with our purchase. These are very reliable trucks. Alan Berg was very helpful and knew the truck inside and out. If I buy another one I hope he is still there. Thank you Alan. The truck fits in good at its new home.<//text>

< Review>
Pleasant experience.   Called lot and spoke to Efren to see if 2019 Ford Edge we saw on website was still available. Told him we were coming to look at it from about an hour away.   Upon arrival, Efron had the vehicle parked up front waiting.  Very nice mannered young man.  We took vehicle for test drive and was very impressed with it.  Ended up not purchasing due to wanting a higher trim level.  Would definitely do business with them in the future if they had the vehicle I was looking for.< /Review>

My wife and I live in Reno NV and she was back home visiting when the starter went out on our truck. Joe McGrath sent one of his techs to her to get the truck started so it could be brought over to the shop. They got our truck in and out in a couple hours and she was back on the road. Joe is awesome and the advisor my wife says was very nice and professional. And thank you to the tech, Brandon I think, that helped get the truck over to service.  I can’t thank the service team enough for making sure my wife’s trip home was safe.< /Review>

Jeff Steves is a straight shooter and a fine salesman.  The inventory is low right now but that will change over the next 6-12 months.  I have purchased 3 vehicles here and will return for my next purchase.< /Review>

I reached out to Napa, Solano and San Joaquin county dealers. Joe Machado at Steve's outperformed every single dealership by a wide margin. From "I'm just looking" until I took delivery yesterday I feel like he had my best interest in mind. I was looking for a very specific truck and I ordered it in person. I left slightly apprehensive without agreeing on a number but I was assured by Joe I'd be taken care of at Steves. He was true to his word. The price I got was more than fair and the process was easy. I'm glad I chose to look outside of the bay area and found a solid family dealership.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>My husband and I were looking for a new truck but could not find what we were looking for in our area (southern California).  So I spoke with Alan Berg who helped me get all of the details completed through phone calls and emails and my husband and I made the 389 mile drive up to Oakdale. Alan worked to get me the best financing and had the truck ready to go and made the experience simple and easy! We are very happy with the service we received and with our new truck!< /Review>< pics>

Had aftermarket GM exhaust installed during recent service visit. There was a mix up with ordering parts but Jason in service handled it well. Very happy with the service I have received with two service visits. Same with Rocky in sales when truck was purchased. I live 70+ miles from Steves but plan to continue to make the drive to avoid dealing with another local dealer.</review>

I went and spoke with Todd, he was very helpful and provided awesome service. The first time I went to Steve Chevrolet was back in February of this year, Todd and Aracelie were the one's who helped me through the process and provided excellent customer service. Both gave me good advice and trust me I will be going back soon.. thank you for all the great service.</Review>

<text>Joe Machado did a great job working through the new vehicle purchase of a 2020 Blazer Premier. I feel we received a fair price and the 20 year 200,000 mile additional warranty even made it a better value. I will definitely recommend Steve’s Chevrolet to anyone looking for a new Chevy or Buick.< /text><Resp>{'time': 1597085997965, 'text': 'Thank you for writing this amazing review for our team!

Excellent experience buying a used vehicle here! These folks set the standard. They were very straight forward and started off with reasonable numbers to work with. We didn’t have to do the back and forth 5 times. Everyone in the building was very nice.  Next time I need a vehicle or service I will definitely return here. See John in sales he was great to work with.<//text>

I bought a 2015 Colorado and it had to be ordered.  We did this with just a "handshake", Jeff was awesome!!  I was treated like royalty... Four years later I had a problem with the check engine light.  I took it in and it was repaired at NO CHARGE!  I can't say enough about the staff and service department.  THEY ARE INCREDIBLE.  I drive 32 miles out of my way for their service.  Thank you Manuel M<//review>

<name>Ryan Longden<//name><time>1564274552738</time><rate>4</rate><review>I'm the original owner if a 2015 Silvarado, Smith has always done my service because it's the closet dealership from home. I was in a bind and needed my truck serviced so I drove the 20 miles to Oakdale, and had the truck serviced there. this is what they found....  after 72000 miles no one at Smith EVER thought to check the engine or cabin air filters! even when last year my AC quit working completely. (thank god for the extend warranty!)   Most likely my blower unit will die prematurely because of the incompetence of a service tech. I trusted this company with the wheels of my livelihood. I will have a hard time ever going back there unless they make it right. I'm in customer service, people trust me in their homes. if i see something out of the ordinary i will inspect and fix it. sad I trusted the Service Department at Smith to do the same thing.... I am so thankful for the guys @ Steves Chevrolet for bringing this to my attention< /review>< pics>

<Text>Wow. I was dreading going to get the oil changed on my  husband's car. But the guys there were so so sweet and kind and very well mannered. They made me feel calm and explained things carefully. The waiting area was comfortable and nice and it was less than an hour wait. Probably closer to 45 mins. Even the women who had me sign off for the car was very sweet. Definitely surprising for a car dealership.

<text>Austin did an excellent job with this unusual transaction. I live out of state which made the process of looking at the car, talking about options and rebates, etc., and, most of all, taking delivery somewhat challenging. Austin made it clear that he was there to make this a great experience for me (I hate buying cars).

And he did!

We talked many times about the options available and those with which I was interested. He knew the car very well, which I truly appreciate (way too many clueless salesmen over the years that had no idea what they were trying to sell me). He was always quick to get back to me when I had a question (there were many), and when he had to do research to answer it, he jumped in with both feet and presented an answer thorough that he often preempted my next one.

When we had finally put together the car I wanted we did zero haggling over the price. I had done a little homework and when Austin gave me his price I immediately knew Steves had offered me a GREAT DEAL!

The final stroke was Austin driving the car from dealership to my house near Portland, Oregon!

Flash forward to today: I am loving my new Tahoe! I have driven a Tahoes and Suburbans before, but this new model is, by far, my favorite. And I would recommend, without hesitation, Steves to anyone I know.< /text>< Pics>

My wife and I drove from Murphys to Oakdale to look at a 2020 Silverado 1500. I did all the research before going so I knew what we wanted and our payments we wanted.  I emailed Tiffany and we set up the truck color my wife wanted. We arrived and was met by Tina Huckabee and she showed us two trucks. We settled on the one and started the buying process. It was the best truck buying I have ever done. They were upfront with every detail , no hidden cost, were not pushy in any way.  They did not try and sneak in things we did not want.They have to be the most honest car dealership there is. If I could give her 10 stars I would. If you are looking for a great and honest deal, drive to Steves Chevrolet in Oakdale .<//text>

Alan Burg, has been my salesman for many years, I have bought 3 different vehicles from  Steve's... Each time the experience has been pretty great.. no pressure, and he took the time to answer all the questions... and was very knowledgeable about the vehicles... This last time he even went above and beyond my expectations... This type of customer service has earned a life long customer! Thank you for being a place that others should learn from...< /text>

Called and scheduled an appointment with Liz for service. She was able to get me scheduled in my requested time and date. I received the reminder text from Ashley the day before. I really appreciated that! Frank was my service adsivor, we was very pleasant to deal with and explained what maintenance to expect in the near future. I couldn't be happier! Great customer service! Thank you Steves!< /Text>

<Text>Steves Chevrolet has always been the best experience when shopping for or buying a car or truck. Fernando Will always have a return customer with me and my family. Besides Chevrolet making great products, Fernando always makes buying simple. There is no back and forth, pressure or the typical sales games. This was the fifth or sixth (I have lost track) vehicle I have bought from Steves, Fernando has orchestrated the last four sales. Five stars for honesty, integrity, friendly and best deals in the Central Valley!</Text>< Rating>

<Text>After hearing some many good things about Steve's Chevrolet via word of mouth from friends and family, I decided to contact them on my recent truck purchase.  I began online,  putting together the truck I wanted via their easy to use website and was quickly contacted by Tiffany Henson.  After letting her know exactly what I wanted to purchase she was able to get me in touch with her Internet Sales Manager Fernando Guzman.  Fernando was able to locate the 2018 Chevy Silverado I wanted and had it waiting for me.   He was great in working around my busy schedule.   I would not hesitate to recommend Steve's Chevrolet and their great team!  Thanks Guys for the wonderful buying experience!<//Text>< Pics>

Steves is the best dealer I have ever worked with or from whom I've purchased a vehicle. They are honest in their financial dealings and determined to get your long term business.  I've been a customer since 1983 and won't go anywhere else.< /Review>

< Review>
First this is a great place to buy a vehicle but the service side of Steve's is horrible. I bought a vehicle from here and had no issues at the start. Then my car developed a coolant leak. I called and set up an appointment to bring it in to have it checked. I told them I wanted to have the full service done and they said that would require an oil change, so I agreed to that as well. The coolant leak was covered under warranty. After leaving I noticed my car wasn't running the same. So I called and they told me it was going to be $150 for a diagnostic test that they had just performed the day before. I am on a limited budget and could not afford another $150 payment  so I contacted GM and had them step in. They were able to get the dealership to take my car in and look. When it got there they noticed that the oil cap was not placed back on all the way,from them doing the oil change the day before, allowing air in. Then they said it was going to cost $2700 to fix. When it was running just fine before I took it to them for the coolant leak and an oil change. They half way fixed the problem and told me that instead of $2700 it was now going to be just shy of $1700 to fix what they screwed up. Telling me that it had a leak prior to bringing it to them and that it was not their problem  All in all it has been horrible experience and now I am stuck with a $1700 bill to get my car running the way it was. HORRIBLE SERVICE DEPARTMENT. I brought it to them thinking that since I bought the car from them that it would be handled properly. Instead I felt like I took my car to a budget shop and was given the run around to just pay money for things that weren't needed. On top of all of this I had no car for a week and had to uber to work. All at my own expense. DO NOT USE THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENT IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO HAVE PROBLEMS LATER WITH YOUR CAR.< /Review>

We had bought a new Buick years ago at Steve's Chevrolet and was very happy with the car and Steve's.  We we're out out CA for 18 years and we moved back a few months ago. We just bought another new Buick from Steve's. This time we bought from the son of the previous salesman from years ago. Steve's is a good family company and they treat you right. Give them a try when looking for a new car.</Review>

<Text>Definitely a 5 star service department. Had a breakdown and left my truck to be serviced. They couldnt help me but they made the calls and helped me get the service i needed from someone else. By being upfront and honest, helping me with the information i needed, and assisting me with a problem they were not able to service i think Steves Chevrolet (and Brian in service department) deserve your next service appointment.<//Text>< pics>

<review>Just purchased a new Chevrolet Trax at Steve’s Chevrolet in Oakdale. Best experience I’ve ever had when buying a car. John, who showed my daughter and me around was helpful to the max AND DID NOT PUSH. The car is beautiful and drives well. I’m very pleased. Next time a friend tells me he/she is looking for a car, I will remind them Oakdale is the place to go. 😀< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

We based the repair on what our diagnostics equipment told us, that being the incredibly high level of unburned gases that were exiting the valves of which the remedy in more cases than not is a standard machining of the heads and valve train. I do understand this was remedied however by using a liquid additive that cleaned or sealed the valves enough to pass smog. Performance Automotive should be commended indeed.Thank you for your comments.  Rand M / Customer Relations Steves Chevrolet Buick'}</response>

<Review>The service deptartment tried to rip my parents off for over $3000 to fix/do repairs for her 2006 Chevy Cobalt just to pass smog!!!! Hell no!  I told her to take it to Performance Automotive in Modesto (good people and honest& good work)for a second opinion.
She was only charged less than $200. Guess what, her car passed smog!!!
I'd  recommend Performance Automotive to anyone 😉<//Review>< user_name>

< review>
I contacted Steves Chevrolet in regards to a 1991 Silverado I own that had been purchased new at Steves. I was immediately contact by Tiffany Henson who was more than happy to help me get some 1991 era Steves Chevrolet dealer tags and plates. It is very cool for me to be able to keep some of the history of this truck.

It would have been easy for them to low prioritize this but they worked very promptly and kept me up to date with what they found. A package from them came in the mail.

I have not been to Steves Chevrolet in person but if this communication and professionalism is done online for such a small unimportant request, I can bet they are even better in person. Cheers to the staff involved! Thank you Tiffany and Joe!< /review>

We were looking for that perfect truck and just not knowing where to go that would meet our needs. I had called a. couple dealers and just did not feel 100 percent happy with the service. So just happened to find Steve's Chevrolet in Oakdale. I picked up the phone at 7:30 pm and spoke to Alan and with in 20 minutes I had applied for credit and was offered the $8,400 rebate and was able to use as our down payment. So then this morning I get the word that they had our loan all written up and truck was ready for us. We got there at 2:00 this afternoon, meet Alan and he had all loan docs ready to sign and within 20 minutes we were done and taken to our truck and he went through the truck top to bottom with us.. Alan is a top notch sales rep for this company.. We decided on Thursday afternoon that it was time for a new truck and in less than 24?hours with Alan's help we have a beautiful new truck,in out driveway.. I would send all my friend's to him, we also will stay with them for any service needs we might have.
Alan thank you so much you were the best car salesman we have ever had.

I had been taking my car to the Chevy Dealer in Modesto, and I couldn't be happier with Steves. It takes me a bit longer to get there, but it is well worth it. These guys fixed a problem in the first visit that went unresolved after two visits at the other dealership. The folks are friendly as can be, and all in all a great group. I really wish I had bought the two cars I bought at the other dealership here!!< /Review>

<text>As usual I shopped the internet for the best possible deal including rebates. The Cruz Eco was an amazing deal, MPG was the largest selling point for me.Chevy claims 42 MPG combined, so far so good seems to be about 46 WOW. Sales (Nick) delivers 100%, I love straight forward car sales. It is rare these days to get more than expected. Home run guys!<//text>< Pics>

<username>Thermie Art< /username><Text>Steves Chevrolet brings back the definition of "GOOD OLD CUSTOMER SERVICE", which is a rarity these days.  Im writing from Australia as we purchased a Chevy Suburban from Steves 2 yrs ago to accommodate our growing family of 7 children.  We rang many dealers in the States, many which we are still waiting to hear back from.....We contacted Steves Chevrolet because we had seen a car on their inventory and thats the beginning of our relationship with them.  We were importing the car so there were many questions and many emails all which were answered promptly and honestly.  Nothing seemed to be a bother, friendships were formed which lead to trust, we purchased our car without seeing it and all over the phone.  We thank Henry and David Webb for their honesty and always going the extra mile to ensure that we the customer are satisfied.  We thank Steves Chevrolet for their outstanding customer service.  You have a great team !  I have no hesitation in recommending them.  You will not be disappointed !!!<//Text>< Response>

From the first moment Fernando Guzman greeted me at the front entrance of the dealership to the last moment when we shook hands before drove away in my 2016 Chevy Silverado 2500 I had a terrific experience. Fernando listened to what I wanted, said it was currently not on the lot but 'let's see if we can get it'. He went right to work searching on the internet and came up with 3 options right away. I was given trucks with different options to choose from with no 'pressure' to choose any of them. It took several days for me to go through my own process of choosing what to buy and during those days Fernando provided the best customer service I have ever had in a vehicle purchase. For real. He kept me informed, provided information, verified with facts and always let me know he was putting together the best deal possible for me. In the end, I was very happy with my deal and my new truck. and I might add - A friend had recommended that I go to Steve's Dealership in Oakdale and I was hesitant to go outside of Modesto. My friend recommended Steve's because of the good experience he had... so I took the drive. I am very glad my friend gave me that recommendation - I will be paying it forward to others!</Text>< pictures>

<text>We love Steve's Chevrolet Service Department.  Joe and his staff are professional, friendly, accommodating and THE BEST!!  Our family has been purchasing vehicles from Steve's for years and we have been using the Service Department for over 5 years.  We have always been very happy with their service.  They are truly concerned and interested in what our car issues are and their drivers Jerry and Jerry are great.  Joe, Jerry, Jerry and the rest of the Service Department are hands down the best anywhere.  I always refer anyone who asks, and sometimes when they don't, to go to or call Steve's.  My next car purchase MUST BE a Chevy or GMC so that we don't have to lose the personal, excellent and awesomenes of Joe and his staff.< /text>< Pics>

Best new car buying experience in a long, long time. The process began as an internet inquiry on a particular vehicle. Jay Bentley contacted me very promptly and we worked out a good price including available GM rebates. The car was about 300 miles from where we live and the trip was worth it. That day was my birthday  and also Jay's day off, but he met us at the dealer and the car was detailed and ready to go. He even arranged to have a big bow and banner on the truck. Jay explained Onstar and some of the other features and how to operate them to me and my wife. He then introduced to other people including the service manager Joe McGrath. Joe later helped us with a small fix the next morning, in and out in ten minutes. The whole car purchase experience was quick and painless. Jay and the people at Steves made us truly feel special. I will come back for my next Chevrolet.</review>

Jay Bentley was so helpful as we went thru the process of picking out the perfect car. This is the 4th car we have purchased thru Jay and Steve's Chevrolet and each experience was completely stress free and we got the best deal on every car we have bought, The sales team and the service department at Steve's Chevrolet are top notch and are for sure the best car dealership in Oakdale and the surrounding area,
Thank you Jay for treating us as friends I truly believe you care about your customers and it shows. My next vehicle will be a new Chevy 4X4  Diesel pickup and am looking forward to working with Jay to find the best truck at the best possible price.
Thanks

<text>They will cheat you out of your money when they cant program a simple remote.  I should have never signed the contact until I knew they could or couldn't do the job.

I wanted to reach out and sincerely apologize for leaving you with this impression of our service team on your most recent visit. Our service team did attempt to reprogram your remote, but as part of the process we need to depress the lock and unlock buttons in order for the remote to accept the changes and unfortunately these two buttons are broken on your remote.

< Review>
We found the color and model of Chevy Silverado on the internet.  There was ONLY 1
in California - located at Steve's. We lived 120 miles away, but we called and Fernando said he would hold it until we arrived.  After a short time of dealing we drove our new pick up home!!  Fernando was able to negotiate a price agreeable to us and this was very important as our choices were limited.
The service department arranged for us to take the truck to the Chowchilla dealership for detailing, this was great service!!  Using the internet and dealing with  great people made our experience above and over the top.  Jim & Kay McBee</Review>

<Response>None< /Response><text>I was married here a few years back and had a bad experience. The man who performed the ceremony arrived an hour late.Ceremony was at my home and he told me he forgot it was at my home and was waiting for us at Chapel. Our guests and I had to wait an hour! And then he was rushing..making our special day feel like we were just a number. This past Saturday he married friends of ours and he was also rushing AND his cell phone was ringing during ceremony...couldn't turn it off!! He doesnt explain steps to couple.Photographer was rude.I would not recommend them. They need to be courteous,respectful and professional,which they were neither.<//text></record>

< Review>
We had an awesome time here from beginning till the end. George was outstanding handling all our family needs. The food was delicious and hot ready to serve, the staff were all dressed to impress. The Factory of Dreams is second to none, this place sets the bar high with excellent attention to details. The bar tender, DJ, Security were all polite and respectful towards all my guest. The lighting for dancing was really unique and professionally  set up. I highly recommend this place for any occasion and want to thank George and staff for a night to remember.<//Review>

< Review>
I went here for a party and it was a very nice place. It was a bit small so if you're thinking about having a huge party, I wouldn't really recommend it. Other than that, the place was beautiful and very well adorned. The overall setting was wonderfully arranged. The workers there were very helpful as well, at least in my experience. The restrooms were pretty clean too so that was good.< /Review>

Located in the heart of downtown Chula Vista this hall is Absolutely amazing and affordable!! It's a little on the smaller size but not too small.. I'd describe it more as cozy or intimate but that doesn't matter, the cleanliness, the security, the professional staff and the beautiful decor will blow you away.. liked it so much that we decided to book our daughters quinceañera at this location.<//Text>

Catered food was not that great,  but I don't even know if that is something specific to the company. They did take care of us, but in my opinion was a bit expensive for what we actually got in the package. Overall, I would recommend if you want to have a party and do very little work.  PARKING IS VERY LIMITED!<//Review>< pics>

This place was awful. Everything from the bartenders to the food to the service. The bartenders had no clue what they were doing...wanted to put the bottle of scotch on ice. The appetizers were served late and cold. The entrees were combined together so everyone got chicken AND steak instead of chicken OR steak. And neither of them were any good anyway. The sound system and decor was good, though.< /text>

<Text>They would've received 5 stars but due to the Security Guard that Though he was tough Now it's 3 stars,

Guetto Security with A Disrespectful Attitude Towards the Host. And Disgruntled Bartender Isn't A Good Way To Earn More Business.  2 family Events Hosted at this location In One month and Both times Experience was Very Similar.

Beware when Pre Paying Your Event. Most of these companies Sell a Packet But they Don't Actually Care that your event goes well they're Not there To keep employees in line,  or toake sure they're Not Acting Disrespectful Towards the Host or they're Guest.<//Text><gmapID>0x80d94dfd900552d1:0x562873f75308207d< /gmapID>< Name>

<Review>This appears to be a very nice mid range resort hotel in Desert Hot Springs.  Several type of rooms are available include in room jacuzzi. Outdoor pool and large jacuzzi are accompanied by a covered jacuzzi if you don't like the sun.  A handicap assist device is found in the big swimming pool.</Review><user>109227524350287460054</user><username>William Gray</username>< gmap_id>

I had a very bad  Experience at this location last time I was there..i ordered a hamburger and told the lady i wanted no pickles and extra onions.. i got no onions and no pickles. It was late night and I didn't notice until I got back home.  Called the next day thru the customer service phone number. They were unable to find my order.  The rep advised me to go to the location and explain what happened..so I went back to the location and they asked her, she says yes I remember you.so I told her what happened being messed up. Then she says I'm sorry.  Did you want some onions?  I just looked.  I actually felt offended by her remarks. What I really wanted was for my sandwich to have how I  ordered it.  But ok. That was my bad  experience I had..</text>

<Review>This Shopping center is ok. There are a few stores here that offer fair pricing .The downfall of this shopping center is that it doesn't coincide with the people in this community  Budget wise. Every community should have pricing that everyone in a community can afford. Otherwise what good does it do for the community. There are only 2 Grocery stores in desert hot springs .Vons,  Stater Bros. The only store that meets the majority of peoples budget within this community is a Mexican Market. Rancho Grande. They are not a Grocery store, they are a market. The majority of there food is  Mainly Mexican food . American food, if you can find some, is overpriced or almost always a day or 2 before the expiration date expires. Why would you put a restaurant that has a lousy burger, fries, and a soda  for almost the same price as a gas bill.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

The center's anchor store is the Stater Brothers. There is a bank, some fast food, a bakery and an ice cream store and auto repair shop. The center is located on Palm, the city's main business corridor.

The Sprint store is new and convenient otherwise DHS residents would need to drive south into the valley to purchase and service phones.

The center is unremarkable in appearance but always busy, especially the Stater Brothers, as it is just one of two large food stores in the city. There is ample parking, in part, due to a few empty store fronts.< /Review>

The shopping centers driving lanes are difficult to navigate, when conjested. Lot's of homelessness. Great little stores inside for the town plus there is the remodeled McDonald's, so it is a main town center. I just don't like how it's the heaviest traffic area in the town and it seems to be patroled the least.</text>

This shopping center has an amazing ice cream shop with dairy free options for myself. There is also a panaderia were my boyfriend picks up treats for himself. I want to try the hip little cafe next time I get an oil change.</Review>

<review>The market place is always busy when I go but not overly crowded. There's a starter Bros market that offer crv recycling behind the store, a Carl's Jr, Bank of America,a smoke shop, and a run down car was that kind of seems like a sanitary problem because there's tons of trash and I think people use it as a dump spot lol. If they did something with the car wash I'd give the shopping center an extra star.</review>< UserId.>

Pretty layed back lots of room. Stater Bros always good to have close by. The donut shop has fair prices. Bank of America is my bank
And they've been improving service over the last couple of years. Carls Jr. One of the remaining really good fast food burgers. I haven't tried the rest yet.< /Review>

Making things hard for local while making it easy for SNOWBIRDS acting like it's a problem for a frequent shopper to get cash back off a debit card " You need to let me know a head of time if your getting cash back its going to be a little wait for your cash almost 15 min for this transaction and I bought groceries WTH<//text>

Not much to say. Don't ever leave a kid or pets in the car it's HOT plus don't ever leave your cars unlock. Be very careful  seen some of the most gruesome, crazy, dangerous, wanted, wicked, lucky, beat down, up to no good, insane, loving, drunks, druggies, pimps, cheap, weak and strong. (A list of the type of people and events you will see here some times many at the same time if your lucky none of this will be around then go play the lotto cause that's too lucky. Lol true story in a a short expression.<//text>

Sometimes overcrowded parking lot and a nuisance to get out. Refuse to shop at the Ranchero store. Been said by former employees,  that they are forced to sell bad meat, after soaking it in vinegar to mask smell. It's also been seen repeatedly of employees dropping food on floor,  including meat and still sell it!< /Review><username>Janet Van Buren</username></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
BofA & Chase Banks
Stater Bros,
City Auto repair shop, (crazy cheap oil change, waaay cool owner 'Jeff') Excellent prices but closed on Sats/Suns.
Adjacent window tinting/car stereo guys (get a Bluetooth stereo for $240 installed! WTH?! (right?) Good window tinter: couple hrs ea car. $175 my '13 Fusion, $135 my daughter's Kia Rio: both light tint both fronts & limo all 3 back windows.
A single bay DIY car wash w/Saturday detail crew you can hire for cheap.
Continuation school
Radio Shack, Doughnut shop, Asian Massage Shop, Mex Food place
Carl's Jr & $1 store. There's a water fill up place in corner (I never went).
I usually just go to Staters & I'm done.
Typical middle income to low middle income environment.
Just go in, get your whatever and move on...unless you run into someone you know, like I do, and yackety yack I go!< /Review>

(Translated by Google) In this city there are not many shops and the few there, well it is the best thing we have here ... the only thing please ... do something with the homeless, scare away customers!

En esta ciudad no hay muchas tiendas y las pocas que ahí, bueno es de lo mejorcito que tenemos por acá... lo único por favor ... hagan algo con los indigentes del lugar, ahuyentan a los clientes!<//Review>
