I couldn't be more pleased with the work that was done, the staff, and the attention to details that Quality provided. The work was done ahead of schedule and my vehicle looks like new - perfect. The Thank -you note that was signed by the staff says a lot about Quality. I will be back to have other work done. Thank you to everyone at Quality.   Brian<//text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>How lucky am I to have found Quality Body Works?! This past summer, my car was unfortunately hit on the side and the door didn't close well. I called Quality Body Works from a recommendation from a local friend. From the first moment I called to the point of driving my repaired car home, this business has provided the best customer service, well beyond my expectations. Doug not only understood my complicated situation with the damage to my car, he also took care of everything, and I mean EVERYTHING with my insurance company. He reassured me repeatedly that things would work out with the insurance...and they did! He also saved me a huge amount of money on finding door replacements. The two doors looked practically brand new at a fraction of the cost. And what about the work on my car? I can say that the investment paid off -- it looks amazing. Everything was assembled well and the paint was blended flawlessly. I am so happy to have my car back!

TL;DR: Quality Body Works is the best body and collision shop you will ever find. Doug and his team are true professionals, and I highly recommend their shop to fix any damage to your car.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1607538376112, 'text': "Hi Tracy!\n\nThanks so much for taking a moment to share your feedback with us, we so appreciate your kind comments about our team and the work we provide.

<review>I can't express how amazing Ross and the entire Quality team are! I had a gnarly scratch on my front bumper and wanted it fixed before I left on a road trip to visit my parents. I submitted photos for Quality's online quote and their team got back to me the same day! Ross had me bring my car in the same day to better assess the damage. This is my first car and my first time dealing with an insurance claim and auto shop, and Ross made me feel so comfortable throughout the entire process. He was an advocate for me in dealing with my insurance company (Geico made the process difficult), always kept me in the loop of what was going on, and made sure I knew my rights as a Geico customer to be fully reimbursed for my out-of-pocket expenses. Ross also made sure to get my car fixed within my short notice schedule (about 1.5 weeks) which was amazing! The team who fixed my car did an excellent job, it looks like a brand new car!! They even left a bottle of car paint for touch ups, and a hand written note with a gift certificate when I picked up my car. I'm SOO happy with the quality, care and professionalism that Ross and his team showed. They will be the team I go to in the future and I would recommend Quality Body Works to anyone!!<//review>< Pics>

YES! YES! YESSSSS! This place is THE PLACE for anything and everything for your vehicle. The two WONDERFUL ladies (Amber & Liz) up front are always very welcoming. My car has been repaired by them on two separate occasions and both times have been nothing but a breeze. They communicated with me throughout the repairs making it such a stress-free experience. I will definitely say that it was nice knowing my car was being taken care of by the best. Every one of their workers are genuinely all about getting vehicles back to their original state (and even more). Give them a call today, you will not regret it!<//Text>

There is not much else to say but excellence! My fiancé and I are traveling out of our Sprinter Van and ran into some major damages on the undercarriage of the van. Thankfully we came across Quality Body Works, Liz and Ross were incredible to deal with. Parts came in exactly when they said they would and the work was done quicker than expected. Full transparency through out the entire repair on what was going on, and when all was said and done we couldn’t be happier. DO NOT HESITATE to go to these guys, family owned and they should be proud of it.</Text>

Nate and staff were awesome to work with.  Kept me updated throughout the entire process, and delivered on time as promised.  I also got a quick tour of the facility. Don't let the street looks fool you.  This place is huge and well equipped to get the job done right.

Repair work performed was awesome, and it was as if my car was never in an accident.</review>

<date>1583784735451<//date>< Review>
I needed some front repair work done to the frame of my car so that it could pass the brake and light inspection that it previously failed. Since I only had 30 days to do a retest, I was extremely worried that I would not find a shop to be able to do the work in time for me to pay my registration. When I called, Doug said he would take a look at my car and that he was sure that he could squeeze me in. Sure enough, I was able to buy my parts and get into the shop the very next week. The customer service (Doug especially) was awesome, and the end results were quite pleasing, though I had a few slight concerns with other parts of service.

My two concerns were:
1. I was never given a quote for how much the work would cost. I was kinda shocked at how much it was went I went to check out, but saw the cost breakdown and it made sense afterwards, but still left me reeling a bit (especially as a poor college student)
2. They had taken the panels of the sides of my trunk to put in my new brake/tail marker lights but never put them back on, so I had to re-install the panels

Overall, the work was really good. I saw immediately that it looked 10x better in the front than before. And I was able to pass my re-inspection with flying colors. Thanks again, Doug and team.< /Review>

<Text>I recently had work done here on my 2019 Prius Prime. It was a small job involving a bracket between the back fender and bumper. I arrived one day and was helped by Liz. She was fast, confident and personable. She provided me with an estimate and even called Toyota to make sure that the part information and pricing was up-to-date. After deciding to choose Quality Body Works to do the job, I called Liz back to give her the go ahead. Again, it was a quick interaction with little effort on my part. We scheduled a time for me to drop the vehicle off. Liz was flexible with me when I had questions about changing the date/time. On the date of service, Liz was there to check me in, which was a very quick process. The work was completed in about the same time they estimated. Picking up my vehicle was also hassle free. The bummer/fender misalignment was fixed and looked like new. I recommend this business because I found Liz to be transparent and easy to work with. I appreciated that she respected my time by keeping the check-in and pick-up processes time efficient.<//Text><rating>5< /rating></record>

They helped me get insurance squared away with the person that hit my car, they helped me get a rental and constantly let me know what was going on as well as when.

Staff was extremely friendly and professional. They gave me an estimate immediately, scheduled me for the next day, and were quite helpful about working with my schedule.  They were happy to give me a ride to work when I dropped off my vehicle and the work was completed in a little over an hour.  It was just a partially detached bumper, but I had heard plenty of stories about how much just fixing a bumper could cost.  They quoted me a much cheaper price than I was expecting, the actual bill was even less than the quote, and the bumper looks absolutely perfect.  I can't say enough about their service, highly recommend.< /Text>

< Review>
Amazing experience! Highly recommend! Professional staff, incredibly friendly and helpful with all of my questions, patient and kind customer service. This business goes above and behind, taking responsibility for errors (if rarely they do occur), however in my case they did a phenomenal job, fixed my fender bender after my car was hit, even keeping it within reasonable price per customer request.</Review>

<review>Ross was extremely helpful and professional! I came to their shop with a huge scratch going down the side of my vehicle. Ross gave hiqqs honest opinion on how to repair the scratch!! Plus by listening to his advice, I saved tons of money. My car looks new again. I am very thankful for the excellent customer service and quality of work that was done on my car! Thank you. I also recommend your shop to all of my coworkers. Thanks again Ross!<//review>< rating>

<text>Had a little of a miscommunication about my drop off date and my repairs took a little longer than they expected but they gave me a loaner car and some coffee gift certificates for the inconvenience so it was no big deal. Besides that the repairs turned out great my car looks much better now and the price was on par and actually slightly cheaper than some other shops in the area. I was overall very satisfied and would recommend this shop for body work!<//text>< Resp>

As the name suggests Quality delivers high quality service and performance.
They were on time and on budget.
Attention to detail was better than expected for sure.

They did an excellent job. Turned my car in on Tuesday and they had it back to me by Thursday.  Not only did they do the repair and paint job superbly, but they also vacuumed out my car, cleaned the matts and had it smelling brand new.  I was blown away by that!!!  Great place to get your auto body work done.  Front desk gentleman was so helpful and very customer friendly.  Was a great experience all the way around.  Thanks Quality Body Works.</Review>

I highly recommend Quality Body Works. They are perfectionist in their work, personable, friendly, and fair.  They did work on my 2007 Rav4 after an 18-wheeler backed into my front end at a stop sign.  You can't tell it was ever damaged.  Also, I was highly upset that my Rav4, in perfect condition prior to the accident, would never be the same.  They actually made it look like new.  They also were understanding and worked directly with my insurance company so all I had to do was sit back and wait until the work was completed.  Good job guys and gals.  Thank you.<//review>

<Review>Quality Body Works has now worked on my vehicle twice over the years.  Their professionalism and attention to detail are next to none.  Each time, the vehicle has come back to me looking just as good as when I picked it up from the dealership.
The paint, in my case a 3-stage pearl, is matched and blended flawlessly.

I highly recommend this body shop, you won't be disappointed.</Review><Gmap_id>0x54d3fffd338d22cb:0x5aa2882a4fbc2ff9<//Gmap_id>< user>

<review>Went in for an estimate. The owner was extremely rude. I asked if I would be charged a higher rate if I wasn't going through my insurance company and he gave a vague answer of no not necessarily. When I asked him to clarify what that meant he told me that he's not the right shop to do the job. Awful, business practices. Whatever you do stay far away from the shop it's quite obvious that they are not a good shop to do business with. From asking the man more questions I eventually found out that he does charge more money to customers that are not with insurance agencies that he normally works with. He was then further rude and I left. Beware!! You will likely get ripped off here.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>
{'time': 1502744130371, 'text': 'Hello, Miss Anonymous...\n\nI"m afraid you are very misinformed about how the insurance repair is done.  We write an estimate using Insurance Industry agreed upon rates for the work needed to repair your vehicle; however, it is an "estimate" based on what we can visually see without tearing your vehicle apart.\n\nIf we find something we could not see during our estimate, then we submit what is called a supplemental to the insurance company and, if they agree with us that it was caused by the accident, then they give us approval to repair at what is now a higher cost.\n\nWhen pressed with specific questions without actually doing the repair, we can not give concrete answers.   We have been in business for almost 40-years and are in great standing with customers, many of whom have come to us multiple times throughout their lifetime, and have repaired vehicles for nearly every insurance company still in business.\n\nYou may contact us anytime without fear or the need to hide behind a pseudonym.

Wow.  Impressive!  My body work on my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland Eco Diesel with Quadra lift was not an insurance claim, but operator boo boo!!  Not only did Bo come to my place of work to take photos and prepare the estimate, he was more than helpful on the discussion of claiming insurance or not.  The estimate was transmitted electronically, which i LOVE, and was very professional and thorough.  And i felt the price was more than fair for the work required.   He offered a loaner but i chose to rent thru Hertz.  They have a great symbiotic relationship i learned, as not only was Hertz already at QBW to pick me up when i dropped my girl off, but 2 days later i was able to leave the rental with QBW who then called Hertz to come and get it!   My car...let me say that she looked brand new!   Can't even tell where the scratches were, AND they touched up some other minor ones i didn't even ask them too!  She was washed and waxed and vacuumed as well!  Cherry Cruiser looks brand new again..and smelled great!  I will use them again if ever needed!</Review>

My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE this place!! Their fried Artichoke hearts (ranch is our dip of choice) are to die for! So good! They always have great deals on artichokes and other veggies. Love their fruit, fruit stands and the family feel that this store gives off! Even with covid it has a pleasant atmosphere and abide by safety guidelines quite properly. Always stop here on our way to monterey or on a cruise down the coast! Highly recommend visiting this place and getting a snack!< /Text>

I agree that the deep-fried artichokes were to die for. I only wish that they included a non-dairy batter. The steamed artichokes were a healthier option. It would have been wonderful to have a non-dairy dip besides the plain Mayo too.< /review>

I was lured in by the enormous artichoke outside, then I saw the sign for 5 avocados for $1 in the fruit stand (mini avocados, but still a good deal.) Once I was inside I just couldn’t stop myself from buying all the fruits...and 3 different sizes of artichokes.  I haven’t eaten the fruits yet, but they all look fresh and good quality.  I would definitely stop here again, if not just to take a pic with the giant artichoke.<//Review>

I have to say eating them fried was another level of good.😊 you get to choose different dipping sauce of choice for .50 extra. Im simple and got the ranch mixed with mayo. Yummy!< /review>< pictures>

We get deep fried artichoke hearts every year for the past few years... it's the highlight of our annual trip.  Last week, we ordered the 30-piece and we were extremely disappointed to find mostly petals and hardly ANY actual hearts!  On our way home to Sacramento, we gave it another try, and again, we got petals and barely any hearts.  We like the staff there, especially the nice brother and sister...< /text>

Very tasty with ranch dressing dipping sauce. Nice friendly people as I stopped in late afternoon.  My first time here and will be back. Fun kitschy place for a visit to taste many different interesting. A little dark as they were open by energy saving with not all the lights on. Some vegetables looked a little dried out, but they offered fresh Jumbo Giant Artichokes. Awesome.</review></record></dataset><record>

<text>The pricing at this fruit stand was amazing, very cheap. We are use to central valley prices. We spent a lot and then ordered a 20 piece of fried artichoke hearts. They were so hot couldn't just eat right away. The ranch we were dipping with must have been home made some of the beat ranch ever.< /text>< pics>

5 stars for fried artichokes and friendliness. The actual store is... Weird. Looks like it is out of business when you walk in or something. But the fried artichokes were delicious - best I've ever had at least. They're actual artichoke hearts, not from a jar, and because of that they have a very different taste. There really isn't much spices or seasoning with them - so i suppose i could see then being called watery. The long reigning champion of fried artichokes previous to these were very seasoned. I love them both for different reasons, but ultimately these take the win. They're just so meaty and good dipped in ranch. Mmmm, go get some. They do appear to have upped the prices though - $12.50 for 30 pieces. Totally worth it though<//text>

We had lunch next door at the Giant Artichoke Restaurant.  This shop isn't affiliated with the restaurant.  I found that though the selection was a bit on the small side for produce, what they had was fairly cheap and very fresh.  They also had froze artichoke hearts for sale in the freezer.< /review>

<text>Ordered the Artichoke platter times three . . . all three artichokes had to be sent back as not properly cooked . . . V2.0 . . . One was OK, two were sent back again . . . we were told this is the best they could do, so we went without. A lifetime resident of central CA, I've been personally cooking artichokes for 50 years, and have NEVER had a problem properly cooking one . . . just steam 'em 'til they're done. If you can boil water, you can cook an artichoke properly . . . These folks truly are in the wrong business.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Text>Fun place to stop.  Prices have skyrocketed.  Used to have 5 avocados for $1, now one medium for $1.50.  Baby artichokes have also gone up in price.  Next door is a fairly good restaurant.< /Text></record>

The sandwiches are large and made to order. The ingredients are fresh. The employees are also friendly. The fried artichokes are the original recipe. A great place to get a good sandwich. Bring your appetite!<//review>

<Review>Giant Artichoke was awesome as usual. The deli is delish. And of course the fried artichokes are #1. It's like walking through a time capsule. The sign in the parking lot that you could see from afar is all faded now.  They have these great old vegetables displays that you know were great in their prime. Their wine bar too. Apparently the people running it now are out  after this year's lease is up. Everything's getting priced out. Even in little Castroville. So sad. It really could be something again that restaurant..<//Review><user>109164016174819392132</user><Response>None<//Response><Rating>5</Rating><pics>None< /pics>< gmap_id>

<Review>We stopped here on a weekend for a late breakfast consisting of artichoke omlette and deep fried artichoke hearts. Both were very tasty and we looking forward to trying more items on their artichoke themed menu next trip. Btw the produce stand adjacent had the most flavorful strawberries I've tasted in a year☺️</Review><Gmap_id>0x808e0712b1d249b5:0xb4ffc6e2d4c39718<//Gmap_id><name>Monica Potter<//name>< Time>

Service was slow and resturaunt was not busy.  Had to ask for ketchup 3 times before the waiter brought it, and he never brought Tabasco that was also asked for 3 times.  Food portions are huge, but flavor was flat.  The best thing between 3 breakfast dishes was the salsa which was probably not homemade.< /text>

If you're in the area this is a must stop for any artichoke lover. Don't even bother with the restaurant next door. The Fruit & Veg Stand has antiquate seating and you can order directly from the counter. You will not find better prices anywhere for fried artichoke hearts period. As of July 2013 you could grab a 20 piece with 2 dippings for 6.50 or a 30 piece for 9.50.  These are the largest artichoke hearts you will find anywhere on planet earth and they come out hot and fresh. I'll end this review now since I'm beginning to drool on my keyboard.< /Review>

Service was good, coffee was decent. Pancakes were abysmal. Potatoes over seasoned but otherwise good. The eggs benedict were buried under a lumpy yellow sludge that we first mistaked for melted cheese. It was edible, but not exactly tasty. Whatever it was, it wasn't hollandaise. I hope it doesn't kill me.

We reached this place around 6 pm (Friday) on our way back from Monterey Bay. The restaurant is placed very close to the freeway , was easy to get on there. The complex was dark as the nearby stores were all closed by this time. However the restaurant àmbience was good.

The Service was fast and in fact the waitress helped us with the best options they had for the day. We ordered Artichoke- Jalapeño dip and Castor roll. Castor roll was perfectly cooked . The artichoke and Jalapeño did not had a proper blend and tasted more of mayo than artichoke and Jalapeño, however it wasn't bad.
4 stars for the service , Ambience and the quality of food.</text>

I was looking for a new storage facility as my previous location had upped their pricing. I spoke with a man who was very informative, personable, and provided great customer service. If youre needing someone to talk to, Akiel is your man. He has a great head on his shoulders.<//text>

< Review>
Just moved my stuff out of Public Storage Palm Desert to bring it back to Los Angeles. We were in this Public Storage facility for more than 10 years, may have been Shurguard when we started with them. The experience has been great. The facility is super clean, cool and we've always felt very safe there. The people we worked with through the years there have been very good and easy to work with. Carlos, in particular was wonderful and continued to provide top notch service through our last day in the facility. If we have a need for storage in Palm Desert again, we'll be back at Public Storage!< /Review>

I visited Public Storage with my friend Lynda looking for a unit as well. Unfortunately they were full. Carlos, the manager was pleasant and sweet. We’ll  return near end of the month in hopes of better luck.< /text>

Just visited Public Storage off Fred Waring and I have to say Carlos is a great manager. He usually helps me with my packing supplies and today was no different, purchased two mattress covers. I was in and out in no time. I also have to mention they take COVID very seriously, I love that. Thanks Carlos.<//text>

Nice mini storage. Very popular, it took my wife weeks to acquire an ac unit here. Worth the wait after viewing other storage in the area. Carlos was efficient snd thorough.< /text>

<review>Alma and Carlos helped me get a storage unit same day! I really appreciated their time and understanding my needs, I called Saturday morning and got a unit that’s after noon and was able to move in my stuff that evening. Super affordable if I could give 10 stars I would!!!< /review>< pictures>

I wish there were more than 5 stars.... I have had a storage room for the past year and a half. I can't say enough about Carlos who has answered many of my questions patiently and handles the transactions with a smile always. He is so professional and helpful and I really appreciate his kindness. The facility is well run, clean and well maintained.<//Text>

Concierge-style service at this location!  We received the utmost care and personalized attention from manager, Carlos, in obtaining and setting up the rental of our space.  Thank goodness there is someone of his caliber managing this facility. Have not moved in yet but we have high expectations that the cleanliness, security and professionalism will continue into the future under his high standards of quality and guidance.<//review>

I have rented units from Carlos (mgr) since 2007, and most recently from Alma. They are very pleasant & patient in dealing with my concerns & made my transfer between units efficient. My one question: I paid my current month's rent and insurance, transferred to a smaller unit, and had to pay the pro-rated insurance (for 28 days) again. Why the double payment? Will I get a credit?< /text>

<Text>I'll admit I dreaded my excursion to this place.  I assumed it would take forever and be a pain in the you-know-what.  Instead, I came away completely sold -- a customer for life.  Their secret?  Probably the fact that their manager "Carlos" is competent and professional.  He was knowledgeable and made it easy for me to understand my storage options.  As a result I chose an inside, climate-controlled unit (accessible by a big oversized elevator).  This place is completely secure -- personal codes to open the gate and operate the elevator.  A special deadbolt lock.  A steel roll-down door.  Clean and dry. (Good selection of boxes and moving supplies, too.)<//Text>< Gmap_id>

<date>1574816818011</date><rating>5<//rating><review>I was in a hurry and needed a unit immediately and Public Storage 800 number operator was of extreme help; she connected me to my local Public storage and from there "Alma" assisted me and made the process extremely easy and with no stress! She had me in and out in less than 20 minutes which included going to the locker, showing me it to make sure it is what I needed...great help...great people!!  Update: Once again I was in a bind for a locker and made one phone call to public storage and spoke with Carlos who made it all happen and I was able to get a locker at a great price with in a very short time. Excellent location, people who are extremely helpful and courteous and the facilities are very clean. Thank you again Carlos for taking the stress out of moving!</review>< pictures>

<Text>Carlos always provides excellent customer service. This is my second time needing a storage unit so I was fortunate to return to this facility located in the convenient Palm Desert location since I know it to be secure, well-maintained, and very accommodating of my sometimes complicated arrangements. Two thumbs up!</Text>< gmap_id>

First and foremost is the amazing customer service! Carlos (and Alma) have continually gone above and beyond for me, handling all of my requests and getting me everything I needed. I can't say enough good things about them. The location is very convenient and building access is open late in the evenings. Units are climate controlled / have air conditioning, which was an important point for me here in the desert.< /Review>

<review>My mother had two units at your Palm Desert location for about four years.  During that time she was in the units to put in or take out things many times.  She had many occasions to interact with Carlos your Manager there.  She always had a good experience with him.  He was polite, efficient and knowledgeable.  She felt he genuinely cared about the safety and condition of her possessions.
When it care time to finally move her things out and into our home it was over several visits in a period of about two weeks.  We used our personal vehicles and a for hire trucker.  Again, Carlos was helpful and considerate.  Unfortunately one of her units was on the second floor and due to a failure of the air conditioning on that floor it was very hot in that area .  Carlos again warned us to come in early and apologized for the problem.
We have all had repeated contacts with Carlos and think you are lucky to have him.  He has also trained the women who help out to do a good job, as well.
We realize no air conditioning during a heat wave is his worst nightmare; but, Carlos was just as professional as always.
If there is an award for Employee of the Month -Carlos Should Qualify!!
Sincerely the family of your tenant in Palm Desert.

<Review>Alma was great during the sign-up process.  Excellent customer service.  Web site should make more prominent the fact that the renter must insure the items in storage.  Adds cost to the rental....  Not a big deal for short term renters but adds up for the long-termer.</Review><rate>5<//rate></record>

Alma was very professional very helpful she was also a delight to talk to. When I went there I was a little bit confuse, I  didn’t know how big of a space I need it. She made  it easier for me to take the right decisions so now I am so happy. Thank you Alma!!!</text>

Carlos and Veronica were exceptional. I was stressing over performing a transfer from my current unit to a smaller unit. Carlos provided great ideas to repack my items so I utilized my space efficiently. The property is also very well kept. Public Storage is fortunate to have Carlos and Veronica working for them....professional and friendly.< /review>

Carlos was amazing, made sure I saw the he entire facility and helped me choose the right storage for my needs. I'm consolidating my Northern CA., NYC and MS properties which requires a great deal of logistical planning, editing and general craziness in scheduling. I feel safe, choosing this particular facility...because of CARLOS! Also, it's super convenient... my Rancho Mirage home is really close, so I'm much more likely to dig in and get all this organization done😉.<//review>

Carlos was extremely personable and very helpful and informative. He really took time with me to go thru the process of selecting the best storage units for my needs. He set me up with the perfect climate-controlled spaces to accommodate my furnishings and belongings and he was very professional in guiding me thru the rental application process each step of the way. This is a very secure, clean, well maintained facility with flexible hours as well!< /review>

Your employee, Carlos helped me with the rental of my first unit a year ago.  He couldn't have been more accommodating, helpful and friendly. He's been a great help year round.
Great service, 5 stars all the way.</Review>

Carlos and Veronica were both extremely helpful, friendly, and knowledgable.  They are the best!  Their prices are competitive, too.  Carlos continues to go above and beyond what is expected.  Truly amazing in today's environment of poor service.<//text>

Alma is a great rep for your company! Very helpful and knowledgeable...when we could not find a space big enough, she immediately called Steve at the Rancho Mirage property and immediately reserved a space he had available! Great teamwork and customer service! Thanks guys!< /review>

My unit was $ 91 a month, they tried to charge me $40 LATE FEES after my payment had issues going through, due to fraud alert on my acc. Public Storage made no effort to help me out, after explaining my situation she simply said pay or you dont get your stuff.<//Review><userid>109390298930465985388</userid>< Rating>

<Review>I give them 5 stars. When they come a family member is always the team leader. Each member of the team has a certain job to do and they do it like a well oiled machine. No unnecessary talking just attention to detail I have a 4 story house with 33 windows and they were done in 1 hour. As soon as they enter they put booties on. And before they put  water buckets on floor they put down towels. Interesting, while cleaning the windows they have 3 towels that they use for certain areas to be cleaned. 1 for glass. 1 for window casing . And 1 for wiping their squeezes.  THEY ARE THE BEST ..... Jason Stanley 10 stars< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

These young men have been doing my windows for over 20 years. They give a window of time and always fulfill their promise. They are polite and respectful. Should it be necessary to correct anything they will return to accomplish this.</Text>

<text>Stanley window washers do my windows twice a year. Heres what I admire the most. Like and body they make mistakes but guess what they come right back out and correct the issue. Also since it's a family business there is always a family member on site. I give them 5 stars for last 3 years.< /text><Name>Kimberly Parsons</Name>< userid>

These are strange times. Jeff and his team went above and beyond to reach every outside door and window in our three story house with many large plate glass windows on the second and third floors, and glass panels on two decks. This was done with no contact with us, other than waving through the window, and took some ingenuity to avoid coming inside the house. Their usual thorough and careful work. Thank you!</text>

I could go on forever about Stanley window washing. They came when they would right on time.  Three of them were professional and paid attention to detail. I would give them 10 STARS. They aint cheap, but worth every penny. THEY WILL BE BACK AGAIN. p.s. my house is 3 stories 32 windows.</review>

<Text>Hello Rebecca,

Just wanted to say that my husband just called to let me know our awning looks new again.  The guys did a fantastic job and now I can get the neighbors off my back ?..   He was very impressed with the results and they managed to get it cleaned in under an hour.  They actually did a much better job then our maintenance staff that does all the common area awnings.  It always helps when you know what your doing..

Thanks and take care!!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Hi Rebecca,
A friend of mine just had her windows cleaned by one of the Stanley teams.  I told her the company has always done an awesome job for us and she should try you.
Just wanted to say thanks for living up to my opinion of you all.  She was extremely happy with the work!< /Text>

<Review>My appointment was originally on Thursday. I was called and informed that the jobs ahead of mine were running longer than expected and was given a new time. As the day went on, it was getting later in the day. I was given the option to reschedule or someone could come out on Sunday. I was very surprised and pleased with the Sunday offer and went with that. One washer came out and did a wonderful job on my very dirty windows. Also, the price for the job was very reasonable and did not charge extra for the Sunday job. I will definitely be using Stanley Window Care for all my window care. Thank you! Best window cleaning company in Orange County! Thank you!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

We used “Stanley Windows Cleaning” three times and although at first the overall experience was ok, each time there was a problem in something. The crew had never cleaned the screens’ tracks, although it was an item that should be cleaned according to the description of their offerings. Once they forgot to wash one of the windows. This company that runs by Rebecca is a poorly organized one. She made a protocol but neither her or her crew followed it. The lack of communication between them always created a problem for us: in payments, scheduled dates, arriving times, etc. Rebecca claims that the company cares about their clients, however we think differently about that. Everyone has cellphones these days and there is no excuse not to call a customer prior coming to their home, but the crew never made an attempt to do that. At their last visit when a manager rang our door bell he did not even care to put the face mask on, although their website says that during COVID-19 time it’s their priority to take every precautions. Besides, the crew arrived 30 min earlier agreed time between me and Rebecca on that day and on my question: “Why?” the crew manager arrogantly told me that they come when it suits them more than us. And on top of that the guys showed such inexcusable carelessness by putting me into a dangerous situation without even noticing it. That was the last straw!</Text>

I first used Stanley Window Care a year ago. I have been very pleased with their work. They are always on time and call me when they are on their way. They are very professional and I have never seen such clean windows. I feel it is money very well spent. I could never get the windows this clear no matter how long I tried. They are very fast and know their jobs well. I would highly recommend this company.</review>

My husband and I had our tile roof steam cleaned after years of dirt, moss/mold build up. Stanley Window Care came out with their Steam Clean trailer and made it look new again. Their pricing was competitive and they did a full clean up of the house and the ground around the house which made everything completely clean. One of the most comforting things was the safety gear they used to insure the well being of the workers. I would definitely refer them to anyone looking for a professional/ safety minded company.<//review>

I just love it when Stanley Window care comes to do our windows every quarter. It makes the whole house feel/look better. I didn't realize how dirty the windows can get until I cleaned them. I have used them for many years now and I am always happy with their great service.< /Text>

We moved here from Georgia and were nervous about finding a window cleaning company that did good work and was trustworthy. Stanley Window Care exceeded my expectations. They were professional, friendly, and were reasonably priced. We also love that they have a follow up program to make sure we are completely happy with the job. We have signed up for their quarterly service.<//review>

I was beyond satisfied with Jason and the work he and his crew did. From beginning to end it was easy. Rebecca in the office was pleasant and professional. The work was done very efficiently and very detailed. Their pricing is beyond fair. I would highly recommend them.</review>

I was totally amazed by the quality of work and professionalism. We had a shower enclosure that was badly damaged and needed to be replaced (based on other window companies). I saw the Stanley ad for glass restoration and decided to go down that road first. They did a great job and made the glass look like new for less half the cost of new. My bathroom looks great again!</Text>

<username>Eli Pasetes< /username><text>Clean windows is great! From start to finish the crew of at least 3 does a great job of cleaning my house windows. They keep the dirt in their towels while inside the house.  And they wear booties over their shoes to ensure the house is not tracked with dirt from outside.  Respectful of the house.  The windows always come out clean.  And within 24 hours, if there are issues, a number is provided to call.  Never had to use it.  And Rebecca calls to remind me after 6 months of another cleaning as requested.</text><user_id>101316811078341058087<//user_id>< Time>

Stanley Window Care has looked after our windows for the last 10 years, and has always been great: careful, courteous, efficient, and the windows look lovely when they finish.  They always volunteer to return to address any issues, but in all the time I've used them there have never been any.  Happy to recommend them.</review>

This company is fantastic!! They communicate well; telling you if they are running late (or early :-)). They are clean, polite and efficient.  Have used them at several properties and cannot say enough about how pleased we've always been.  Give them a call - you won't ever need anyone else!</Text>

I really appreciate the service I received. They came to do my windows and did a great job. However, it rained a day after I got them cleaned. So, I called the office to notify them. They sent a crew out 2 days later to touch up the windows that had been affected by the rain. Very nice customer service.<//Review>

I wanted to thank Stanley Window Care not only for their actual service but also for what they didn't do. I was under the impression I needed some extensive cleaning done. However, Jeff assured me he could take care of the problem at a fraction of the cost. So I got a great window cleaning job.  And got my pressure-washing done for a lot less than I expected. Thanks for the honest business practices guys.</Review>

Our 60 home HOA hired Stanley to perform window washing (exterior) services following the conclusion of all homes being painted.  We were very pleased with their punctuality and quality of work.  They were also very respectful of our properties, including shrubbery and flowers.  Many residents expressed satisfaction with the job that was done and commented on how nice the workers were.<//text>

<Review>They saved me a lot of time and aggravation by pressure washing (steam cleaning) my badly neglected hard scape in my backyard and around my house.  It came out looking amazing and the best part was I didn't have to do it. I would highly recommend them.< /Review>< Pics>

Stanley Window Care is first rate. I have lots of windows and noticed the Stanley truck at a neighbor's home. She rated Stanley Window Care first rate too. The team is quick, and careful.  I have relied on them for several years.

Wow, what a cluster%$&^! This company apparently has local and national offices. If you give your personal information to a local branch and then call back the same number, you will be sent to a national number who will not have any of your info at all. In addition, the national company cannot even tell you what hours your local store is open. Glad I found out how bad they are so I won't use them in the future.< /Review>

< Review>
We enjoyed eating here. We didn’t understand the menu at first so my son and I ordered sides as entrees. My husband got the ramen and enjoyed it a lot. The pork belly was excellent. We also ordered a side of rice but would like to try the sushirrito next time. I can’t eat too much gluten and a seaweed wrapped burrito sounds like an excellent idea. Good portion sizes and lots of flavor!</Review>

Kopan Ramen restaurant located in Los Angeles,California in the popular Korea Town (K-Town) section of LA is one of the best ramen restaurants around!
Japan Ramen features a great variety of ramen dishes and appetizers that are freshly made to order and delicious!
We ordered the chicken curry katsu and ramen noodle soup that was well made and delicious.Our courteous and helpful waitress was attentive and prompt.
Portions were generous with a beautiful presentation that made out meal a great experience. Located in the Ma Dong Courtyard Plaza with plenty of parking and close to a wide variety of entertainment including the historical Wiltern Theatre
and the world famous hip hop and R&B "Arena" Nightclub .
Kopan Ramen Restaurant is a great experiance.</Review>

I waited very long for my order. We ordered 4 things and when me and my mom finished our food, my younger brother wasn’t able to eat because they forgot about our order. I wouldn’t recommend coming. It has slow service. I know better places than this.</review>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>I walked in the restaurant around 930pm and I was denied service by Evin he told me that they already started closing the kitchen down and I was not able to order. I was very confused being that the store doesn’t close until 10pm. I asked if I could speak to a manager and he said that the manager isn’t around and that he’s NEVER around which is another major issue. This was very upsetting for me, I am a huge fan of Kopan Ramen and eat here VERY often, the food is amazing but the way I was handled tonight was very unprofessional. very disappointing!<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>A nice and solid place for ramen. They have a good menu with a solid selection of items. The wait is never too long. The prices are also very good for what you get. I recommend the spicy miso ramen!< /Text>< user>

<Text>Staff were friendly and the restaurant was clean. It's like chipotle, but with sushi. Tried the fish bowl and fish burrito and loved them both. I prefer the bowl tho. I will come back to try other stuff on the menu.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I personally love kopan ramen but this location is something I will avoid. They close early and don't even validate the parking ticket. It's $2 per 15 mins of parking, pathetic.</Review>< gmap_id>

<review>My best friend is Catholic and wanted to stop by and see this church in person while in Lake Tahoe...it's a beautiful peaceful place. I grew up as a Catholic and remember going to church and how peaceful it was for me as a child. I'm Christian and I now know more and feel his presence in me where ever I am 😊<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><user_id>110445393670481991415<//user_id>< Time>

<review>The church was open at 9:30 in the morning. A Filipino family led the novena to our Mother of Perpetual Help.
We returned on Christmas day for the 12 noon Mass and the service was solemn and the choir was excellent! At the end of the service, the Pastor gave out a copy of 'Rediscover Jesus" as Christmas present to the community.< /review><user_id>100038807418058834931<//user_id><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmapID>

<text>Was visiting a friend in SLT. Went to St T about 3pm when arrived in town hoping to make a visit to the Blessed Sacrament.  Rang doorbells no answer. Guess I did not have on the right clothes. Went to the 8am Mass today.Mustabeen irish retired priest. Raced thru the liturgy. No Confetior. No homily. Raced through an abbreviated version of the Eucharistic prayer. Should I be glad I do not live there but was only visiting? Father priests. You might be burned out and bored with reciting these words for years on end. But if you really want the Church to live and thrive please at least make the effort to bring some fresh new rejuvenating WORD to the people you are ordained to serve. If you are tired and bored what the heck do you expect of us nobodies in the pews. if not for us you would be out of a job. Would I  approach a bored priest for the Sac of Reconciliaion? Heck no. But at least the liturgy was in English, my home language. No longer the case in my home.parish. I am grateful for that. As well as.the.opportunity to attend Holy Mass. Thank you.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80998fe2f98039ab:0xcb043914feafa145<//gmapID></record>

I just finished their 6 week challenge and successfully lost 6% body fat! The coaches are so amazing and supportive—pushing you when you need it & cheering you on! The challenge truly kickstarted my fitness journey & was worth every dollar to get me to my short-term goals. Try it!< /Text>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Great workouts for those who don't like the same routine workouts!

I joined the 6 week challenge like many others which did require the $499 deposit and to meet either goals of losing 5% body fat or 25lbs. I think the hardest part of the challenge was probably the diet plans because it really required a lifestyle change, and it really made me aware of what I was putting in my body. Their meal plan is very straightforward, but you really do want to workout everyday regardless of the minimum 3 times a week class workout to meet the challenge. I focused on cardio and going to the classes which are super fun! You do it at your own pace but you get more out of it by challenging yourself. It was awesome to see myself being able to slowly follow the class at a better pace and I definitely felt myself having more energy throughout the day as well. They vary the warm up circuits and boxing rounds which make each class different! It's definitely important to try to book the class ahead of time since they do book up quite quickly!

I was able to ultately lose 27lbs and 5.1% body fat after the challenge! Highly recommended for anyone wanting to change your lifestyle!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1626365454867, 'text': 'Thanks for the review Cheyenne'}< /Resp>< GmapID>

This is a place where I take time for myself. It’s my playground, my fitness home. They have excellent, motivating instructors who will help you meet your goals in fitness and guide you along the way. They have a great location on the second floor with high vaulted, well-ventilated celings, open, airy, spacious, and always kept clean. The members are friendly and helpful. Great selection of music and the instructor always make it fun and energizing and it almost feel like you are not at the studio.<//review>

I love the workouts and I love the FB groups! It's a great community! The coaches are amazing too!
Only reason for not choosing 5 stars is the schedule. I wish there was a 6:30 class on Friday's too and a later class on Saturday so we could take full advantage of the workouts. I don't like being just limited to 4 days for what the month costs.</Text>

<review>I recently completed the 6 Week Challenge and chose the goal of losing 6% bodyfat. I ended up losing 17.4 pounds, 6.4% body fat and gained 2% muscle - which means I'll be getting my accountability deposit back!

All of the coaches were helpful whenever I came in with a list of questions. Throughout the six weeks, I had the opportunity to take class from 5 different coaches. The only negative (for me), is the location. I was commuting from Chula Vista, so this meant commitment and a set schedule.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1625346465379, 'text': 'Jasmin you CRUSHED it!

<Review>Something really shady about not being able to give me a price unless I come in, especially during a pandemic, during which many other providers have created safe alternatives for their customers. Not these guys. (Mind you, used car dealerships give you prices over the phone). I really wish I could post my screenshots from my conversation. I offered to do a consultation on Zoom or over the phone and they said "no you have to come in so we can discuss your weight and goals." Hmmmm.... Yeah no thanks. Sounds like a total gimmick to me. There are TONS of options for unlimited classes online for $20 or less. Crunch fitness does a 90 day free trial and $10 a month for online. Les Mills Kickboxing is $20 a month. There are WAY less shady options if you want to go online.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1614985823804, 'text': 'Jennifer thank you for your feedback. We kindly disagree with your “shady” comments as we are a highly reputable organization with an excellent service we are very proud of.  We are an upstanding business in the community fir the past years, and have even won the Best Business in Poway award.\n\nIn response to your comments, you showed interest in our 6 Week Challenge (6WC) which we explained can be earned (there are two ways to earn it for free). But not everyone will be suited for the 6 Week Challenge as it’s a highly successful program (you welcome to see some challenger transformations https://www.facebook.com/ILKBBestBodyTransformation). The 6WC is used to teach great healthy habits but with  a goal of losing 25lbs, or 6% body fat. As explained to you we therefore need to do a body composition and weight measurements with our scale to ensure a prospective challengers BMI is acceptable to be admitted to the program, as we DO NOT promote unhealthy weight goals.\nSo once you attend the consult then we could make that determination.\n\nMost Challengers do workouts at our studio, but the 6WC is also available online, if that is what you preferred, but the initial consult, 3 week and 6 week check-ins are also done at our studio.\n\nWe wish you all the best'}<//Response><gmap_id>0x80dbfa33f963693f:0xe10b2ddacb59d0f3< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I found this gym on an ad through my Insta. I took the 6 week challenge and with the support of my awesome coach Sway as well as the challenging workouts and diet plan I lost 27lbs in 6 weeks. I really feel like my old self again. I’d gained the “COVID” 19 and was determined to get back in shape. The team and members were very welcoming and the Facebook community was very helpful. I bet on myself and with ILKBs help I won. Thank you to the entire team. Definitely check out this gym if your looking for a good time while you put in work.< /Text>< Pics>

{'time': 1600120527896, 'text': "Dear Nicole, thank you for your feedback.  There are actually 2 ways to earn the Challenge for free.\n1)You can either join the ILKB family and you will IMMEDIATELY get the 6 Week Challenge (6WC) included for free, and that includes unlimited in-studio workouts, or at-home live zoom and on-demand workouts.\n2)Or you can chose to just do the 6WC in which case if you are serious about getting into shape and are ready to commit to yourself then we ask you to put down a $499 accountability deposit, and when you hit your goals you get it all back which means you get the 6WC for FREE (and yes ask anyone who has done the Challenge, you do get it back).\nThe accountability deposit is critical to the success of the program as it makes challengers take this seriously. We ran this program before with $0 down and challengers didn't take it seriously and didn't complete the program.\nIf someone is not prepared to back themselves and commit to program, then now may not be the right time for them. We take the 6WC very seriously and invest a significant amount of time, effort and resources into every single challenger to ensure they hit their goal.\n\nFollowing this process over the past 2 years over 80% of female challengers meet their goals and either lose 25lbs, or 6% body fat in just 6 weeks following our enjoyable AND sustainable nutrition plan, highly effective and fun workouts, and accountability coaching. Those that didn't meet their goals unfortunately didn't follow the plan 100%.\n\nWe welcome and encourage everyone to reach out to any former challenger (most are still with us working on new personal goals beyond weight loss) and ask them to get firsthand feedback. Many of them will leave comments in posts on the challenger FB groups, or have actually posted their transformation stories to try help others take that step to change their lives. And all of them are very willing to speak to new challengers."}<//Response>

< Review>
Big disappointment! I had purchased 5 classes thru Facebook and once I took my first class I ended up purchasing 60 additional classes that cost more than $1200. Then covid happened, I have been stuck at home homeschooling 4 kids. And today ILK told me all my classes expired! I used only 6 classes. I understand covid wasn't their fault but being stuck at home with my kids also out of my control. on top of all the stress, now I lost over thousand dollars for nothing!

Update:
Well, thank you for your reply. First of, I knew I couldn't commit to a regular schedule that is why I paid extra money per class and opted out to purchase bulk classes instead of a membership.
I had a hectic schedule for couple months because of health problems. Just because I used few classes in the first half, are you implying I wasn't planning on using these classes?
These are group classes by the way, it's not like I am taking a private instructor's time who was gonna make your company money otherwise.
I am also not asking for a refund, me joining a group class is not gonna lose your business any money. I am only asking to be able to use the classes I paid for. We are in a pandemic, things are out of everyone's control.  I dont understand why these classes expire in these extreme circumstances.</Review>

<resp>{'time': 1614983774168, 'text': "Hi Nesli, thank you for your message. We are sorry that you didn't get to make use of your membership but I would like to clarify all the efforts that were made so that you could make use of the membership you opted to buy.\n\nYour 1 year membership started 9/24/2019 and was set to end 9/24/2020. After showing you all the membership options you decided to select  the 65 Class Card which provided you with the flexibility you wanted to decide how often you wanted to work out, and has a set expiry of 1 year.  We only shutdown for mandatory closures in the middle of March 2020. So you had already had access to approx. 6 months which equates to 50% of your selected membership, but at that point you had only made use of 13 of all your available classes.\n\nIn March 2020 when CA Stay at Home were issued and we shut down the studio in-person classes, you had approx. 6months of membership left. The Stay at Home order lasted approx 3 months, and were only able to reopen the studio doors in June 2020. We therefore automatically extended your expiry date by 3 months, moving your expiry to 12/24/19. Later on we then added another 2 free months to extend your expiry to 2/24/20.\nSo in total we extended your remaining 6 months of your membership by a total of 5months.\n\nHowever at no time throughout the shutdowns did we stop providing ALL our members access to their favorite ILKB workout. When the Stay at Home order went into effect in March 2020 we immediately  gave all our members, including you, 100% free access to our Online workouts, which includes Live Streaming workouts throughout the day, as well as over 100 On-demand workouts.  We still offer that additional service to our members at no cost. We developed this new service and built out these new platforms so that we could provide all our members with access as we understood that their daly schedules were impacted by Covid, and that some members circumstances wouldn't allow them to workout in-person at the studio (some were high risk, or were looking after high risk family members, or had children at home which prevented them from attending in-person workouts as often as they would like to, or simply at the time due to Covid concerns they preferred to workout At-home)\n\nWe also went ahead and built an outdoor studio to ensure those members who could do in-person, or preferred in-person workouts, still had access to in-person workouts.\n\nWe understand your frustrations but as can be seen we made every attempt to ensure you had access to ILKB workouts, and even added a further 5months on the remaining 6 months of the  membership option you selected even though throughout that time there were various options to access your workouts, including options to workout at home. Most of our members were totally reliant on these workouts during the Stay at Home orders, and we still have several members that for various reasons continue to only do our Online workouts even though they have had access to in-person workouts since June 2020.\n\nDespite all the measures we put in place we always prefer that you made full use of your classes during the past 17months. We know you enjoyed the workouts so we could look at rolling over a few of your  remaining classes into a new membership. This option would give you an opportunity to make better use of your expired classes. We could even look at letting you select a smaller class card membership and rolling over some of your expired classes into it. This would give you a further year. Pls reach out to the Owner to help you out with this option if it is of interest."}</resp><Gmap_id>0x80dbfa33f963693f:0xe10b2ddacb59d0f3< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The ILKB Poway team is amazing and there is nothing else like it in the area! The ILKB brand itself is pretty reputable and is known for it's tough workouts/strong sense of community. Knowing that, this Poway location is no different. The workouts are freakin tough and the instructors all have their own personality and make it a joy to workout. I live in San Diego, CA and know how many restrictions have been put on gyms since the start of COVID, so I am really thankful they do their best to follow the rules and keep all the members safe. They have 2 options for joining the studio which are membership or challenge. All of the information is laid out online or you can simply schedule an appointment to discuss with them. Not sure why people leave a 1 star when you can easily just call to get the info. Either way, I really enjoy working out here and have seen good results! Keep up the good work team Poway!</Text>

<Review>ILKPoway is the best hour of my day.  I been coming here for about a year off\on.   When I first came here I was about 215lbs,   I’m now down to 185lbs and counting.   All the Staff here are awesome and will always motivate you to do your Best.  But the real life changer is their meal plans.  They teach you what to eat and they cater it to your needs.  I would definitely come and check it out for yourself.  They are offering a one time free class trial to check it out.   Message me if you want to Take a class.   Thanks ILKPOWAY

I'm so happy that I found this studio! Over the past couple of years, I have tried out many different studios and classes (barre, spin, pilates, etc.) This is the first place that I visited and immediately wanted to become a member. The facility is spacious and clean, the coaches are all friendly and make an effort to get to know you. Each class is different and exciting- warm up, stretch, 6 rounds of bag work, partner work, and another cool down/stretch. They constantly have different challenges, events, and giveaways to keep their members engaged and motivated.

What to expect on your first visit:
1. Call and make an appointment for your first class!
2. You walk up the stairs and are immediately greeted by a huge chalkboard with your name on it!
3. Check-in at the front desk and they'll give you a quick tour
4. One of the coaches will guide you through the class, teaching foundation moves and technique
5. Sweat and enjoy!< /Text>

Kickboxing is SO MUCH FUN!! I was intimidated at first but once you go, you don't want to stop. Every coach at ILKB-Poway is awesome.

<review>Love this place!  I was looking for a killer workout and community and I found both here.  Tried out a couple classes then decided to become a member.  As a former collegiate athlete structure is my best friend and the class schedule allows me to create that.  Whether you’re a beginner or professional the instructors are really helpful in teaching proper form and giving you pointers to improve along the way.  It’s been worth the investment so far!  They were super accommodating when I got pregnant and had my baby.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><gmap_id>0x80dbfa33f963693f:0xe10b2ddacb59d0f3<//gmap_id>< name>

<review>I decided to give Kickboxing a try after a friend of mine told me how much she loves it. I purchased a 5 pack of classes and went to my first class on a Saturday morning. The Instructors I met we're friendly and very helpful with making sure I was doing the punches and kicks correctly. I was quite surprised at how much fun it was. I knew it would be a good workout but I wasn't prepared for working every muscle in my body. What a great feeling! In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I signed up for a one year membership on the spot. I look forward to my next class. If you aren't sure if Kickboxing for you, give it a try. Don't be intimidated (like I was). Everyone is welcoming, motivating and I guarantee you'll have fun!</review><UserId.>117180813712460607071< /UserId.>< Pictures>

False advertisement. The email from iLKB poway advertises “free quarantine at home workout”. Once your on a zoom call with a live coach they start throwing different prices and challenges at you. ITS NOT FREE.

They were very persuasive with me signing up for the 21 day challenge program. I was told that I would be given a “special deal”. IF I’D SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE CHALLENGE I WOULD BE REIMBURSED 100%. I was hesitant to accept, but I did. Once I signed and payed, the costumer service declined. My “mid week” consultation was booked, but when I logged on, I waited 15-20 minutes with no response. The meal plan was standardized by hight and weight. Nothing special.

On the “exit consultation” is where your surprised with details that were not provided at the begging or were unclear. They lie to you initially to get you hooked, but at the end of their programs they don’t keep to their promise.

Poor communication. Getting a hold of a staff member is a hassle. Almost a week passed before I was able to get a hold of someone. I felt like I was being avoided. It took several Facebook messages before I got a response. Facebook was the only way of communication until I requested to speak to the manager. I was given an incorrect email address. Again another delay with a response.

I shouldn’t have to pay for low quality service, or staying for another program and see my money go to waste again. They DON’T reimburse you. That is N an option. They are not accommodating. All they do is throw numbers at you.

Do not sign anything! You’re better off doing your own workouts and diet program, since they’re a waste of time. They don’t check on you or respond in a timely manner. Very unfortunate to have people and businesses taking advantage of people in this situation. If 0 stars was an option, that’s what I’d give them. They scammed people out of their money!<//Review>

<Text>ILoveKickboxing is Amazing! As someone who likes high energy workouts, I could not have found a better gym. Each workout provides the ability to challenge yourself and grow. I can feel myself getting stronger after each workout, and just being in class makes me happy. No matter what happens during the day, kickboxing makes everything better. The staff is so dedicated, motivating and welcoming. They welcomed me with open arms and I couldn’t have asked for a better kickboxing family.</Text>< pics>

I am very new to kickboxing. I joined with a couple of my friends just to try it out and have some fun together. This is a hard workout but it is a fun environment and the staff is very helpful! I am so proud of the progress I have made so far and everyone we have met have been so supportive and kind! A great way to workout and improve your overall health! We have gone to nine classes in two weeks and it is so rewarding to feel yourself getting stronger and better at the sequences. The coaches are encouraging and never yell at you, which is so helpful. I am so excited to see where this journey takes me!</Text>

I have always been very active in staying fit and keeping a healthy lifestyle, but I have to say, 'I Love Kickboxing' has blown it out of the water. The work out is challenging, effective, well-rounded, creative and above all, FUN! The instructors are like family, the energy is through the roof and it is one of the favorite parts of my week. I recommend this studio to all of my friends because anyone can do it!  5 stars, 10 out of 10, two thumbs up for my favorite work out at I Love Kickboxing<//Text>

Kickboxing is such a fun and great workout for beginners or athletes.  I think it's great for former athletes who enjoy interval and group training. I joined about a year and half after having a baby, and I love feeling strong and flexible again!  They are really into using heart rate monitors so you can track your progress and compete against yourself each workout.  I definitely recommend this gym!</Text>

You'll see dozens of reviews that kick boxing is the best workout ever...and they're right.  They focus on your STRENGTH...its not just about losing weight.  Beyond that, they take personal interest in their members.  I was out of town for two weeks and coupled with a work schedule that kept me away for almost three weeks, and they sent me an email asking where I was.  What gym notices when you're absent?

Get here.  Try it.  Don't be intimidated.  They're here to help.<//Review>

<review>Super workout that always manages to be fun and challenging at the same time! The location is easy to get to and the gym is always clean (which is a very nice change compared to some gyms). The most notable thing about this gym is the staff; they're helpful, enthusiastic, positive, caring, fun and keep you wanting to come back and succeed.

I went from basically never working out at all to doing ILKB three times a week. I was intimidated going into it but everyone has been so helpful and supportive. After 2 months in the class I already can feel the big improvement I've made. The class is really what you make of it - there's always a couple people in the back chatting through the whole thing and other people giving it 110% effort drenched in sweat. It's a structured class but you really go at your own pace and the instructors help you to find modifications for pieces of the workout as needed. If you're hesitant at all or have anxiety about starting a new routine, this is definitely the place to put your worries at ease!<//Review>

I honestly never though I'd be able to find a "gym" that I enjoyed going to! This place is great! Kickboxing is great! Everyone here makes you feel like you're part of a family and I actually find myself missing it when I miss a class! If you're looking to get in shape, look no further, this place will kick your butt and tighten it too! The instructors are super fun too! Shout out to Vanessa and Lisa, if it weren't for her I probably never would have signed up!</Review>

WOW this gym is beyond words!!!! I've never felt better. The instructors are so nice and push you to do your best. I have never felt more motivated in myself. I go In the morning before work and every time I leave feeling so great and ready to start my day. The instructors truly do care about everyone and want you to benefit. Most important they help you, my footwork isn't the best still but they always show me so much patience to help me correct it. I 100% recommend this to revenue who actually wants to get fit and wants to have fun doing it!<//text>

ILKB Poway ROCKS!!! I joined last month and it was the best decision for my fitness journey. The classes are super intense but so much fun! You burn a crazy amount of calories and even though it's a challenge, it's so worth it. The instructors are motivating, energetic and always encouraging. This is way better than going to a boring gym everyday. I walk out of class each time and feel strong both physically and mentally. Join and you won't be disappointed!<//text>

Great workout, great instructors. I truly believe kickboxing helped with my stamina during my 10K. I felt great the whole run (and I'm not a runner) and probably could have kept going! I attribute my strength to kickboxing! The instructors are very friendly and helpful, I've been going for a few months, but I've seen them with new people and they're very attentive to make sure new kickboxers feel comfortable with the moves. The hour long workout goes by quickly and I feel energized afterwards.</Text>

<user>103722260449360509279</user><Review>I really like the class because they start with a good warm up and stretching is always included which is important to relieve further pain the following day.  They change the routine on the jabs and kicks so you wont get bored even if you come on a daily basis.  I like it as an alternate to running and dancing.  The trainers are super nice and not intimidating at all.  They teach you proper form.  Like other reviews, the whole hour goes by pretty fast you won't get bored at all.  Classes regardless of time seem to be always packed which means this facility is well liked and established.

I suggest you bring hand wraps because your hands will get sweaty and they rub off on the gloves. Compression socks if you don't want to workout bare foot.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Time>1512378986339</Time>< gmap_id>

This place is seriously amazing! I have never had so much fun working out and on top of that you sweat like CRAZY. The instructors are all so amazing and really structure the class to fit any fitness level. The best part is that every class is different so you can go every day and leave sore every time. The classes are upbeat and there's always room so you can just show up! They've even added classes which is great for a quick after work session. Highly recommend for anyone who's tired of the boring typical gym life.<//text>

I've never been someone to go to the gym willingly (especially for cardio!) but I always knew I needed to! The energetic staff have created a fun environmen that gets me pumped and excited to get moving! and now I find myself wanting to go all the time and encouraging myself towards my goals! The workouts are a good challenge at your own pace which is perfect for anyone. Everyone there is super friendly and the facility is very clean! I've been going for a few weeks now and I've already seen progress!< /Review>

<Review>I absolutely LOVE ILoveKickboxing – Poway. I found them through their Facebook Ad for 3 classes. I said, “Why not?! It’s worth a shot!!”

After taking my first class, I felt I made a GOOD decision about this place. The entire staff is SOOOOO welcoming and friendly, you always feel a part of the “family”!

They start you off with a tour of the facility, then talk to you about your goals. Once those are established, you get to learn how to wrap your wrists and hands and finally get to put on your gloves! That’s when it became real to me, LOL!

In your first class, your coach teaches you the basics and is there for you the entire time. I really liked that part, especially because I have never done it! It was definitely a nice intro to the class and you can guarantee you WILL be sweaty after it!

I don’t like going to the gym but coming here is a different story! It’s a different workout each time and you are ALWAYS challenged. You can go at your own pace which is also very nice!! I get a GOOD workout in EVERY SINGLE TIME!!

I would encourage ANYONE to try it out! Put in the work and SEE/FEEL the results! You will be glad you did, I sure am!! Hope to see you in class!!<//Review>< pics>

I am amazed at how much progress I have made, with the help of the AWESOME instructors. They go out of their way to help you and to make the classes fun.

For my birthday, I received 4 free kickboxing classes and free gloves at ilovekickboxing in Poway. I wasn’t sure at first if this would be the kind of workout for me but I was pleasantly surprised. I love it so much I ended up signing up for a year membership almost immediately.
I was most impressed with the instructors. They are so friendly and committed to help you meeting your fitness goals. They have fun raffles, DJ nights, contests, etc...that help motivate you and make working out really fun. I’ve met some amazing fellow kickboxers too because you can see that they love working out at ilovekickboxing Poway just as much as I do. If you’re looking for a place that provides a fun  full body workout that is geared toward helping you meet your fitness goals this is the  place for you!<//text>

First, the exercise is never “routine” which means your body is effectively challenged every single time. Second, it’s like the "Cheers of Gyms" - it’s a place you go where everyone knows your name. Going to a gym is just going to the gym. Going to ILKB is like meeting up with a bunch of friends and laughing. Plus, every time I walked in that door, I got a cheerful hello. I was really impressed with how attentive the instructors were by making sure to talk to me before class and ask how I was doing. It’s a full body and mind immersive workout which means you’re not watching the clock to see how much longer. It's dynamic, fun, and the fact that everyone is working hard means just gives you the extra lift to keep going.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>After paying for a gym membership for a year and realizing I just didn’t enjoy being anywhere near a treadmill, I started looking for alternate activities. That’s when I heard a kickboxing studio was opening down the street.  I figured I would give it a try because who wouldn’t want to go and hit something for an hour.  So glad I decided to try.  The first 15 minutes of “warm-up” can definitely test your limits but after a month of regular classes I can see a difference in what I am capable of doing during those first 15 minutes.  The bag rounds are always fun and the instructors will roam the class and help correct your stance, punches, and kicks. They are not intimidating and will continue to work with you until you get it right.  They will always explain the “do’s” and “don’ts” so that you don’t injure yourself (or anyone around you).  Overall it’s just a fun experience.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I have been a type 1 diabetic since 1989 (yes, I’m old)! I have always been insulin dependent on two types of insulin. I started ilovekickboxing on opening day back in February. I attend class 3-5 times a week on average and I LOVE it! Everyone is so uplifting and motivating, I look forward to being challenged. I feel myself getting stronger and have lost inches. On May 1st, I started the 21 Day Nutrition Challenge with one of our instructors, Vanessa, and some other members. I decided to go mostly paleo on this challenge and I have almost completely eliminated carbs all together. I have not needed to take ANY of my short acting insulin since then and my long-term insulin dosage is getting lower and lower! I am in awe and disbelief as I watch my blood sugar levels stay constant and “normal.” I have never experienced such success with this disease nor felt more in control of it. I owe this almost entirely to my ilovekickboxing family. The moral support, motivation, and fun atmosphere are things I wouldn’t change for anything in the world!! THANK YOU!!</Text>

<text>It's a great place to hangout. The senior center provides lots of things to do.  Monday  is classic movie day. Weds  is bingo
Fridays is new movies.  Special luncheon for only $3. Free hair cuts. They have crafts, computer,  library  billards,  a gym, many other classes. A person can get the senior bus. Be left off and picked up. You could buy lunch or breakfast on certain days. You can also bring your own.  The center also sells coffee and snacks for less than 50 cents. They also offer excursions . You can read all about them in the Riverside parks & recreation magazine. The senior center is a great place to meet people and get social. The staff and volunteers are helpful and friendly.  Once a month the center gives out a bag or two of food items for free. The program is called food share
In the summer there is air conditioning.  In the winter there is heat. Come on down. Seniors in Riverside means 55 and up of age. No one has a time limit of how long you could hangout.  At least until closing.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

< Review>
Great friendly little bar on base. They have free pizza during "happy hour". I my case it was not free. It was the first place I found after arriving on a Space A flight and checking into my room. Don't be a rookie like me and walk in with a baseball cap (hat) or you will hear cheers and a bell ring. Next thing you know your buying a round for the bar. Thankfully, when I entered only four people where at the bar. The round was $32.00 with tip. Four new friends, great conversation and several slices of pizza (to try to make up for the loss).

They also have rules against putting a cell phone on the bar (almost got me on that one also) & touching any of the model aircraft hanging from the ceiling so be careful.

Hey, I am retired Air Force what do I know about crazy Navy rules. It was all good.</Review>

<Text>This on base bar/club is a hidden gem.  We had a great command outing and I enjoyed a solo visit once before as well.  The staff are very friendly and accommodating.  Just be certain to read the rules or you may find yourself buying a round for the room!< /Text><user>109734422248696261364</user>< pics>

< Review>
AMAZING! Our last stop for the night, with our whole wardroom, it was a total blast!!! The bartender handled all of our orders and the whole group very well, despite an extremely rowdy dice game! Full of history from all the aviators who have gone before us, it was the best way to celebrate together and not have to deal with the drama of rides and driving on base... We all simply walked back to our lodging after the night was over!!!<//Review>

I'd give it 5 stars but I had to buy a round for having my cell phone on the bar just as I was closing out.  Lol.  Great place with great history!<//Review>

If you're a service member or know a service member you need to stop by here. Best bar with the most affordable prices. Debbie (the bartender) is amazing.< /text>

I like going to the one in Montclair with my daughter the people are very Pleasant and patient they have everything you need and want and if they don't have it they can get it for you they can either ship it to your home address or you can pick it up at GameStop.</review>

They're getting rid of all the classic system stuff. No more Gameboy games or other legacy stuff... Get rid of some of the junk that isn't games to make room for.... Games!<//review>

Everyone at this location is so friendly!!
I love how excited they get whenever we ask about certain games, they have no problem breaking down the pros and cons. My daughters (4 and 9) always ask a lot of random questions and the guys here are always patient
and try to answer their questions with lots of details.
I live in upland but this location Is definitely worth the drive.<//review>

Super kind and friendly staff. Really went out of their way to be helpful. Used stuff is reasonably priced and the selection is totally decent, but the service alone merits five stars easily.<//Review>

<text>Good place to get your hands on used equipment and games quickly. Prices for new things are in the high side so consider for convenience only. It is nice to have more items related to the gaming culture provided the new Think Geek ownership. Pricing and price tag information may be a little confusing, ask before buying if there are any questions on promotions. Also remember that the initial price provided when your purchase it's totalled may include protection plans and other warranty services that can be declined.

I would not recommend selling them any equipment or games, their but back prices are shamefully low, but understandable due to business overhead costs.

Staff at this location are friendly and helpful in all my interactions.</text>< pictures>

Thomas Store leader is TRASH.  So rude.  Pulled the 3rd customer in line when we were first for no reason.  Was super condescending about a product that he said doesn't exist when it does they just don't carry it.  Some "leader" teaching his employees how to be as rude as possible.< /Review>

<Rate>3</Rate><Review>Was placed on hold for 45 mins just so they could check that my preorder was still there.  Ended up hanging up and had to go in person.  Employee sounded like the same person who put me on hold and never apologized for it either.  Took her for ever to look for my item when it was in plain sight.  All she had to do was tilt her head up and she would have seen it.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I don't get the point of having a number to call, if nobody answers. You work at gamestop, how hard can your job be!  Ridiculous</review>

This location has just recently changed from Sweetwater to Coronado. As soon as we walked in the manager greeted us and walk just around the entire store. He took us in the back to show us his personal bike along with other customs. The sales people here immediately greeted us and helped us with all of our purchases. Everyone here is super friendly. Only reason I cannot give it five stars is because they had very little in local merchandise for their store because they were still switching over. Otherwise this is five stars all day long. Decent selection of bikes and a very nice waiting room if you having your bike serviced.<//review>

I came to this location to pick up a shirt as a gift for my friend. The sales associate Desiree was friendly, welcoming and made me feel like a valued customer.
Excellent customer service experience, job well done!</Review>

absolutely love this place took my Dyna into the service department for routine maintenance and repairs. A little pricey but they got the job done with speediness and communicated all necessary repairs required. Definitely going back to this location for my trade in and purchase of my new ride!</review>

Professional yet down to earth staff. Always willing to lend a hand and almost always have what I need in stock. Parts dept guys are awesome and patient even when you for some reason can’t remember what you came in for. The motor clothes/accessory dept is well stocked and the staff is friendly and not pushy. The sales guys, I’ve chatted them up a few times and they’re a ton of fun to shoot the breeze with, hooked up a buddy of mine who had gotten a bum deal from another dealership. If I was in the market to get a new bike, this is where I’d shop.< /text>

A few days ago I stopped by for the first time looking for a new set of tires for my Road Glide. Since they were all booked up for a couple of days I decided no to buy them. Instead I walked around the store and get some shirts and stuff. I was great by a girl named Andrea, she's super nice and so helpful. I'll definitely come back again. Excellent customer service in here ..<//text>

Don't buy your new or used Harley here. My experience from beginning to end was not enjoyable. I was treated like I didn't matter and that if the sale wasn't made to me then another customer would walk in after me and buy the bike because they're in such high demand.

Here is just one example to be more specific. I had set up a specific meeting time with the sales manager and a salesperson concerning a new shipment of bikes coming in that day. When I walked in that afternoon, the salesperson asked "what brings you in today?" and the sales manager told me he didn't think about me or the bike until I walked in the store. The shipment never arrived and they didn't know  that until they looked into the issue when I walked in.

Take your business somewhere you'll be valued as a customer.

Edit**
The parts department at this store has always been extremely helpful. I've only dealt with service once and they were neither good nor bad.< /text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Took my electra glide in because the cruise control was blowing the fuse every time I turn it on, after paying for the diagnostic the technician recommended a new $106.00 switch, and if that didn’t work the next option would be the module that according to service advisor Harley Davidson didn’t make them any more. So i decided to look for the problem myself and found a grounded wire between the fairing and the frame. Cruise control works great.<//Text>< user_name>

The girls in merchandising were super sweet and attentive. They had a nice selection of clothing, helmets and leathers. They have a great selection of new and used bikes...all in excellent price points. The salesman Dino was patient and informative. The financing department can work miracles. We well definitely be back! They have created repeat customers with us.<//Text>

Dropped in yesterday with a problem with sluggish running on my 2013 FLSTC. We were on the road from San Diego to Yuma and didn't want to risk a breakdown in the desert.
Jake, the service manager, despite a full schedule got my bike on the lift in minutes and gave it a thorough inspection.
Although the battery was a little older than it should have been Jake did not try to upsell me a new one but said it was still good. I'm the one that insisted on having a new battery installed.
After the diagnostics and inspection were complete they sent me on my way with a full tank of fuel!
Overall the dealership is very clean, friendly and professional. I will definitely visit Coronado Beach Harley Davidson in the future!

I came here because I tried calling numerous times with no one picking up the phone.  When I arrived I was helped immediately and was able to get my bike worked on the spot which is convenient. I havent had any complaints with the customer service so I will continue to get my bike serviced here.  They offer a military discount which is also a great incentive.</text>

Super friendly! I told them my budget and they work with my budget to the fullest! Gabriel answered every question I asked. He also helped me picking the right bike for the right price. After buying the bike they provided my wife and I with a full tour of the establishment. I got to meet everyone! The GM, parts guys, service guys, and receptionist. When I say everyone I mean everyone! They really made me feel like apart of the family!<//Review>

<review>Big shout out to the service department. We recently moved from Seattle to San Diego and after having my bike shipped, it sat idle for over a month. Battery was weak and after making a call to Coronado HD, they came, picked up my bike and worked on her for the next 24-35 hours. I picked up my bike yesterday afternoon and she roared like Mufasa on a fight day with Scar. Thanks for bringing my baby back-to-life! This will be my go-to place for all service needs!! (Wifey needs a new bike too, so we’ll be back to check out some of those preowned’s)!<//review>< Date>

I had a fantastic experience at Coronado Beach Harley Davidson! The staff was friendly and welcoming, the events there are always consistent and fun for everyone. I'm pleased to make this my new hometown dealership of choice! I recommend you give them a visit and see for yourself that great customer service does exist in Southern California!<//Text>

<text>First things first I want to specifically thank Gabriel and herb for their dedication to helping me get the bike I wanted I went in there last weekend with the intention of looking around for a trade I spent some time with Gabriel as he showed me around all the bikes specifically the preowned because that’s what I asked for he ran the numbers and was able to find the one that matched my budget needs I definitely was not an easy customer but Gabriel went out of his way trying every option to make things work. Today I rode my iron 883 down to CB Harley Davidson and rode home on my road king I couldn’t be more happy thanks to everyone down there I definitely feel like part of the family< /text>< Date>

<Review>I go here to pick up parts for my 99 Sportster.  Most of the time they are cheap parts like screws, connectors, or some small plastic piece.  The man in Service with the long black hair and Charger tattoo is always incredibly helpful and patient even though the parts I need are extremely cheap.  Very impressed with the customer service and the helpful attitude.</Review>< pictures>

I have gone to them for several different parts and they usually have what I need even though My Harley is a 2006 Sportster. If they don't have my pat they always order what I need. Marco and Nacho are always very helpful and very nice to boot. I would definitely recommend them to anyone who has a Harley. Oh and they give a Military discount which helps. Great people there.<//text>

<Review>Confused about electric. They have level 3 fast charging that I considered checking out while shopping at their store last Saturday. I was on way to work ( few hours to get ahead of project). I own a 2003 Fatboy since 2003... Recently bought a BMW R9T. I also very recently bought a Chevy Bolt! The Livewire was a bike I've been wanting to check out for some time. I arrive at dealership...two employee Harley's parked in the "electric motorcycle only" Level 3 charging spot. They saw me drive up and let me park at charger. Chargepoint system not working. I was hoping to check out the Livewire while charging for 20 minutes or so. I wanted to schedule a test ride. If installing an electric charging station that entices electric vehicle owners to show up at your dealership isn't a good thing for your business model...your business model is in trouble. The very next day I read that Livewire production is halted. I'm pro electric. The torque is fantastic! Gas stations suck. I'm hoping Harley figures this out. I won't be wasting my time on a Saturday for a free 20 minutes of charging any time soon so they don't need to worry about that.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80d9520d469363fb:0x9a86f79f3d1ea9e1</gmap_id><user>102561454578516563986<//user><response>None< /response><Rating>2<//Rating>< Pictures>

The best costumer service experience! The people here are very friendly and very professional. They will go above and beyond to make sure that they find the perfect motorcycle for you. So if you are thinking of buying a motorcycle you have to go to this place! Ask for Adrian, he was really great, very helpful and will not try to upsell. He will make sure you find a bike you love.<//Review>

They went over and Beyond what I was expecting at the dealership to get my motorcycle fixed. They were even able to suggest some parts for my bike that I could get. When I went to go pick up my bike after my accident it look like the day that I got my motorcycle which was great and the day that I went to go pick up my motorcycle they were doing a benefit for people that have cancer which was great. Considering that I deal I am dealing with cancer myself.</text>

<text>Sweetwater Harley is a great dealership with an excellent staff.  Recently I took a job back east but my bike was still in San Diego.  My girlfriend was trying to prep my bike to be shipped but was having issues.  I called Bobby Bradshaw who actually sold me my Street Glide about a year prior and asked him if he could assist my girlfriend in making sure my bike was good to go.  He didn't even hesitate and went over on his day off to make sure everything was squared away.  To me this shows the commitment and dedication the Sweetwater Harley crew has to their customers. It's more than just selling the product. Thank you again for everything throughout the years!  I will miss coming into your dealership.  Best of luck to all of you guys!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Bought a 2015 Heritage from Bobby at Sweetwater Harley and had a great experience. By going in with my bud Brian and getting my Heritage, Bobby hooked us up through the referral program. The Sweetwater poker run was awesome too, walked away with a Harley long sleve shirt. Bree was awesome because she made sure that I would be running trouble free for the next 5yrs. All in all, great experience from California's first HOG chapter. Keep up the great work and thank you!! Live to Ride-Ride Easy< /Review>

I went in to find out about a new Harley and the guys were so welcoming that I ended up with even more than I had imagined, we went through then inventory together and walked around the entire 50k sq ft showroom, I even got to check out the upstairs party scene. I'm happy to be a part of this group and can't wait until I can take my hand-picked street bike out! The classes they referred me to seem very feasible, so I should be ready in no time. Bobby B.  and Mikey V. are the best guys here!!</Text>

My buddy took me into harley to check a few bikes out. He introduced me to Bobby B and I was immediately impressed by the way he and Sweetwater Harley presented themselves. Bobby made sure I knew everything about anything that I wanted to know. He got me a great deal on a 2016 Street Bob and I absolutely love it. I strongly recommend going down to see Bobby at Sweetwater Harley. You'll leave a happy customer guaranteed.<//Text>

< Review>
My son bought a Harley from Bobby. I live in Oregon and went down to San Diego in July. My son introduced me to Bobby and I was so impressed with Sweetwater Harley and Bobby, that I told Bobby that the next Harley I buy would be from him. Last week my son called and told me there was a sweet FLTRI that I would love. After talking with Bobby I bought the bike over the phone! Bobby went out of his way to make all this happen. And of course I have to thank Brooke as well. You both are amazing people. Bobby really makes you feel like "part of the family" and not just another person. Now, I cant wait to see the new bike! I strongly recommend Sweetwater Harley, and Bobby, what a team!<//Review>

<Review>We came in about a month ago to scope out bikes and get an idea of what we wanted. My husband didn't even have a motorcycle license yet, and we needed more information. Bobby was seriously so wonderful from the very beginning. He directed us on how to start the licensing process and to come back and see him once we were done. We came back a month later and Bobby helped us find the perfect bike for our needs, and budget. Everyone at sweet water is so friendly, and makes you feel like family. Any concerns I had were reassured and they really listen to what you want. Thanks Bobby for taking your time with us and helping us find the perfect fit!<//Review>< Pics>

<review>Too many screw ups!  From financing, to ordering stuff, to getting our license plate!  We do like the service department here though. They seem knowledgeable and friendly. It's like two different planets dealing with service and EVERY OTHER DEPARTMENT!  They don't answer the phone!  Unfortunately we bought out bike here. We wish we had gone to San Diego Harley Davidson!  We will NEVER go to this location again.</review>< Date>

<name>Ron Rogers</name><Pics>None<//Pics><text>I have been using Sweetwater since long before they were in this building. I have been riding for over 50 years and can tell you there is no perfect bike shop! However, if you want a shop you can develop a personal relationship with, depend on to make it right if something goes wrong, and have the best prices, I would recommend Sweetwater!  Unlike other Harley shops, many if not most employees stay here. Also, it has been my experience that, if I find an item cheaper at another Harley shop, they match the price. As for the shop, I have to remember that not every mechanical or electrical problem is easily diagnosed and sometimes is seems there is a gremlin living in the older bikes, (just sold my 97 Road King with over 100K on it). To the best of my knowledge they always stand behind their work.
In summery I will say this is a great locals Harley shop, just like the shops of old when we depended on word of mouth and not advertising to locate a reliable Harley Shop. Spend some time there, ask their names and call them by name when you return.

Service department is really overpriced and they charge you even for the air you breathe.
I am saving around $200 in my full services since I go to San Diego.
Besides everytime I pick up my bike after a service or whatever, it comes back with a new problem, with no gas and all dirty.

Update:

Travis from service is amazing, best customer service I ever had, for real.
That will give you an extra star.</Review>

Best Dealer in town. Courteous, fair, and understanding; my sales person didn't nag me, push me or harass me when it came time for me to buy my first bike, or my second. He understood everything I was going though and was patient. Even offered me some great advice! I will always recommend Sweetwater.<//text>

<Text>Wow, I called in to schedule a  rear tire replacement and the guys says he has time now. I rush my bike down to get the work done and when I get there they try and charge me $150 in labor saying the free tire change was not available. Watch out for these guys! After a quick google search I found the same Dunlop  down the street much cheaper.</Text>< user>

They lied to us saying the bank approved us then he said they didn’t, then said they did , they  made me go to my bank pull out $5,000 for a down payment only to find out they lied to us . Bad customer service & sales people who are just liars ... I’ll take my $5000 somewhere else where they are honest & where they don’t lie to customers... It was a waste of 4 hours & made the experience so stressful & ruined it for us . BAD BAD BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE</text>

Coronado Beach Harley-Davidson
4 months $4173.oo
after 4 months I got my bike back with Fender bolts loose, fork cap nuts loose, windshield/nacelle hardware loose, caliper loose, gas gauge wasn't installed properly, grips not glued, steering head out of adjustment, brake rotor screws under torque, riser bolt loose, handlebar clamp bolts loose, fork pinch bolts loose, fender tip light misadjusted and was installed before paint was cured causing damage to paint.
fender was done different from the pictures I provided

I was told by Coronado Beach HD service manager they would take care of the repairs if I wanted to bring the bike to a different HD.
Got repairs done, sent invoice by email, and called to speak with Service manager Jason T.
he will not take my call

One of the better Harley-Davidson dealerships we've visited from across the country. Under New Management from the old Sweetwater Harley-Davidson; Coronado Beach Harley-Davidson as it's now known is a shiny example of just how long this legendary motorcycle is supported and loved by its community.

After a couple of phone calls, they accepted my offer.  I went in the next day to put the bike on hold.  The hold was $500 non-refundable.  During the process, something told me to confirm that our deal still stands.  JJ asked the manager and he said a big “NO!!”  Wow!!!  After dealing with many dealerships, throughout my life, I never had such a “shady” thing happen to me. The manager was going to let me give $500, non-refundable and then stiff me for what we did not agree on.  Funny, my friend told me they did something similar to him.  “This is not the way you do business”</review>< Pics>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Recently got my first "Freedom Machine".....everyone at Sweetwater Harley was AWESOME in helping me get started.  Bobby was my salesman who instantly made me feel welcome and part of the Harley family....Brooke handled my financing, and it was sooooooo much better than the headache that is dealing with car dealerships, plus she's HI-Larious!
And I can't forget Blanca and Nacho who went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure I had the right gear to get out on the road and start riding!!

Basically, if you're looking for a Harley, Sweetwater is THE place to go!!  THANK YOU GUYS!!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80d9520d469363fb:0x9a86f79f3d1ea9e1< /Gmap_id></record>

I'm going to be honest with this review as I always have. I was used to having the old Sweetwater Harley, apparently they got rid of some. The problem with this is new ownership comes new rules and they really never have anything stocked. The young ladies at the counter say that they've been on order and they're waiting for him to come in in the meantime you need a pair of gloves you had your have to buy the ones they have in stock which are from like 2015 they're very limited ugly and nobody wants them. Along with the lot of the other stuff they say they're on order but they never get there so you're forced to buy stuff that wouldn't have been sold in the first place. All in all the customer service there is is okay everybody's on edge because of the new management which in turn turns to the customer customer service you get over treated nicely. Because everybody is afraid they may get dismissed or reprimanded they're expected to over act which is being fake to me. So if they can just cut it with the acting act normal I know most people there from before act like they are and will continue doing business. In the meantime we'll see where these family nights and events take this place these happy hours on Fridays is logrolling on Thursdays and these little bands on Saturdays we'll see what happens in the meantime we'll keep will keep going until they give us a reason not to.</text>

I came into town with a squeak that the bike picked the day before in AZ.  I called @ about 5:00 & asked if they could fit me in.  They said bring it over in the morning.  They were ready and waiting for us.
Quick, courteous & professional.  I couldt ask for more.
The staffin motor clothing was also friendly and helpful.<//review>

Bought my first new harley from here.  I had a few add ons to put on so i left the bike with the sevice department for 11 workdays while i was out of town. They did no work on it and gave me no updates. The service department  claimed they couldn't get the parts shipped in in that time frame. Offered no compensation for their tardiness. Literally the only employee I worth anything is Eric in sales.  I will not be returning to them for any service or parts.  Another customer lost.<//text>

<Text>I went in to Sweetwater Harley-Davidson for the first time to have a new set of foot pegs installed on my Softail Fatboy by their Service Department. Brian the service manager was professional and the staff was really friendly while I waited. They have a fantastic selection of riding gear.

< review>
I bought a 2014 Low Rider last year on Halloween from these guys.  Leading up to my buy I visited all the H-D dealers in the area; SD, El Cajon, and Sweetwater.  I live in Chula.  Sweetwater was by far the best and knows how to do business.  I took maybe 2 months to buy a bike and really appreciated not being sold to.  It was the first time in my life that the product sold itself.  Every time (4 times total) I showed up at Sweetwater they were all like, "pick two bikes and let's go test ride."  I found exactly what I wanted and we came to an agreement.  Since then I've only taken my bike in once and that was for the 1000 mile inspection and service.  I've gone in for parts a couple of times and early on even did some business with the rental folks.  Everyone I've met there has been solid.  I'm pretty sure someday I'll buy another bike from here.  The only negative I'd give these guys, and all H-D dealers, is on the cost of service.  I chose to do my own 5K service because of the cost they charge to do a simple inspection and oil change.  I'll probably go in for bigger service milestones with these guys.< /review>

Service was terrible. The motorcycle started rusting seconds after leaving the lot. They will not stand behind their product. I was told I should have been washing the motorcycle every day with Harley special soap. I’ll never recommend this dealership or Harley to anyone< /Text>

<Date>1466623016553</Date><rating>5</rating><text>First of all, i just want to say, there are quite a few different dealerships around the San Diego area that you can go to for the same exact bikes, but hands down, Sweetwater is #1 on the list. Being that im in the military i am on a fixed income. I had a 2006 Dyna Low Rider that ive had for about a year and i was looking to upgrade. Ive known Bobby Bradshaw for a while now and know multiple people that he's sold bikes too and ive got to say, he is by far the best salesman i have ever encountered, HE is the main reason i went to Sweetwater for my new bike. He is a Marine Corps vet who understands what people in the military go through and he does anything and everything to get you on the bike that you want with no pressure. 10 times out of 10 i would 100% recommend anybody, ESPECIALLY military, to go to Bobby Bradshaw at Sweetwater. I know that if i ever need anything else that i can trust him to take care of me and my brothers. Thanks again Bobby for everything you do for the HD community and what you've done for this country.</text>< pics>

<Review>I have always wanted a motorcycle and saturday may 21st 2016 i decided to go take look at some. Some friends of mine recommended sweetwater harley Davidson, saying it was a good place to go so that's where we went. I got there and was greeted with hospitality and introduced to bobby bradshaw. So we started browsing the large inventory of beautiful Harleys and i came across one i liked. The 2016 street 750 in superior blue. Bobby did wonderful talking to me about all the paperwork and payments never trying to force me to buy and was understanding in what i had to say. Everything was looking go so i decided to go ahead and purchase the motorcycle and i dont regret it! The whole staff was so friendly and helpful and really make you feel like family. If you or a friend is looking to purchase a motorcycle this is the place to go, you won't be disappointed.< /Review>< pics>

<Text>I had a fun time negotiating with JJ  and 0Effrin. I bought a 2015 free Wheeler. JJ , Effin and Britney helped me.
Brittany knows the right stuff,keep it up.

Nacho is your parts guy , the best. Glad nacho stayed,

JJ told me  "they're writing crazy deals", So I made a crazy offer. It took a couple of days, but that gave me time to make sure of what I wanted.
Test rode it twice.
Talked with Michelle in service, she was great ,she looked up the history on my bike.
I am waiting to see if after sale follow up is good.
Effin owes me.
This my 3rd purchase from this location.
5 stars will follow if after sale care comes through?
Sales counter girl, Came back "Sailor mouth".
She is fun to deal with.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Date>1414205926495<//Date><Rating>5</Rating><Review>I brought my bike in for a service a week ago. After getting ready to roll for the weekend, I noticed a strange noise coming from the primary. I suspected it was due to something that may have happened, or been missed, during the service.

I called the service department and the manager, Charles, had me bring the bike in for a look-hear. Andy, the technician who conducted the service on my bike last week, was brought out to listen to my bike. He immediately identified it as a loose compensator nut (if any of you have ever heard this noise, it is horrible. I've likened it to the sound to one of those small pull back toys you had as a kid when you would pull the car back and, instead of letting it go on the floor, pick the toy up and let the tires rip out in the air). I had had this exact noise a few years back and recognized it again after he stated the problem. I can't believe I didn't recognize it myself.

Not wanting to miss my weekend ride, I realized I was now at the whim of the schedule since the issue was not at all related to my prior service. I asked Charles to see if he could get me in...Alfredo said they could get Andy onto my bike the next available time slot. I gladly accepted the offer and prepared to take a taxi back to work.
Upon hearing me mention a Taxi, Alfredo offered to have Marcos drop me off in the SweetWater F150. This saved me a chunk of change... furthermore, Marcos even came back to my work to pick me up and bring my back to pick up my bike. Apparently, this is a free service that SweetWater provides if their drivers are available.

While Andy had the primary cover off, he recommended replacing the Chain Tensioner pad since we were already in there since it was only a $5.00 part and was half worn. This is great advice and preventive maintenance. I believe other technicians may not have been so observant or bothered to recommend the replacement.

Upon paying, Nate advised Alfredo not to forget my military discount and saved me a bit more cash on the gasket.

Thanks guys, so far, I'm glad I selected you to be my dealer of choice while serving in San Diego.
See you further down the road.

(Translated by Google) Very nice people take care of you without eagerness, they sit with friends and help you financially to take you the desired motorcycle, Danny and Omar total partners ... and the entire warehouse celebrates with you when you close the deal. A great place

(Original)
Gente muy agradable te atienden sin afan, se sientes con amigos y te ayudan financiramente a llevarte la moto deseada, Danny y Omar parceros totales... y todo el almacen celebran contigo cuando cierras el trato. Un sitio genial</review>
