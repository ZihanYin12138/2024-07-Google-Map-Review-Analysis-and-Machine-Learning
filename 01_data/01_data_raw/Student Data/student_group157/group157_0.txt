<Review>Why 5 stars?  Cuz a pita of this caliber, a pita of this freshness is too flava-flav to passover  with a sad 4-star.  In Hebrew, when something is so great and so supreme, there is no word for it. I won't blaspheme, but the combined flavor of lamb, hand-made grilled pita wrap and garden-fresh veggies oozing with yogurt dill...words escape me as my buds ache to define that flavor.  I'll just stick with some hack yiddish and say this place is mechuga-good, crazy-good!😛< /Review>< UserId.>

<text>Now this little  gem of meditation  flavors is tucked away next to a van's mkt , to my surprise I've been  very happy with my choices, of a Laffa or pita  sandwich . The Falafel  or Sharwma,  correct me on this spelling,  but the flavors are what I'm coming here for and I can back that up cause , I brought  someone a  sandwich  and they were raving  about how good it was . This  is a solid , in my book, also  there is a little  bakery a few doors away that is a nice treat if your into sweets, 4 stars as well.</text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c29babb69c8517:0x9a2feef9ba8fe008< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Again, my kids turned me on to another great place to eat.  Food is delicious and the service is great! I'm vegetarian and I was so happy they have options for me as well. The falafel wrap is excellent.  FRESH, FRESH, FRESH!! Mutabal is bomb! I will be going back again. Owner gave us a complimentary red cabbage to try and gave his love to my family.  Who does that anymore?!? Highly recommended them!<//review>

Friendly staff. Easy pickup experience.

Perhaps the Bay Area and the recent trip to Israel has spoilt me with excellent falafel plates and falafel sandwiches. I was excited to try Pita Pockets, especially after reading the excellent reviews.

My experience was average. The falafel was slightly soggy, lacked the crisp/crunchy texture and did not have a distinct flavor.

The falafel plate had plain boiled white rice, which lacked flavor or seasoning.

Perhaps, the food is better enjoyed fresh at the restaurant than as takeout. Also, this place may be better for their meat options. Or they were having an off day.

It's COVID, and restaurants are working very hard, so I do not want to dissuade anyone from giving Pita Pockets a shot. I did, and found them lacking, but this is purely based on the 2 falafel items that I experienced.

On the positive side, their hummus wasn't bad. Also, they have a hot sauce that I enjoyed -- it adds a much needed punch to your falafel sandwich.</review>< Pics>

<review>There is nothing I can say about this place that everyone in Northridge doesn't already know. Family run business, fresh food, and laffa bread made right when you order it. You haven't had laffa bread before? Then please try it here first. Allow your first experience with this deliciousness to be at a place that has perfected it.

I have been ordering the same thing every time I come here since they first opened...Chicken Shawarma Laffa. Think of it like a mediterranean burrito. You can call it a wrap, but it isn't remotely close to what most people envision when they hear the word wrap. The chicken shawarma is rotating slowly on a vertical rotisserie waiting to be placed in the the warm laffa. You get a choice of fries or rice. Not on the side, but on the inside of your laffa creation. Go with the fries. Trust me. They top it off with hummus, lettuce, tomatoes and marinated onions and roll it up like what could only be described as a giant burrito.

I have been all over Los Angeles and tried shawarma and laffa at dozens of places. Pita Pockets is the best. Hands down.< /review>< Pics>

DELICIOUS! I got the Chicken Shawarma Laffa, which was so big I couldn't even finish it. They gave me some extra foil to wrap it up, and I got to enjoy the rest of it for lunch the next day. My friend devoured the Gyro Plate (except for what I was able to sample!) The meat practically melted in your mouth, it was so tasty and spiced to perfection. The hummus was fresh and the pita - just WOW! So soft, warm and flavorful.

I was surprised that we were the only ones in this little gem of a restaurant. I will definitely be back to try everything else on the menu!<//review>

Their gyros are absolutely delicious and filled with so much flavor! They're packed to the brim so you will definitely leave full!</Review>

Stopped in here randomly while on a road trip. Excellent gyros and baklava. The employees are extremely helpful and polite. Everyone in our party was thoroughly satisfied with their meal especially for the price that the items were. I can only hope that I come back here some time to fetbanoget  gyro from Pita Pockets!< /review>

<Review>I always get the laffa gyro. Mainly the one with rice. They also have an option with fries in it instead. Both are awesome! Big, fresh pita from the clay oven, tasty, and consistent. Haven't been there in about 4 years, but tasted the same as the first time. Little on the pricier side for a gyro, but the quality and taste show why.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

If you’re not looking for it, you might miss this great place! It’s tucked away in a strip mall and doesn’t stand out in appearance but the food makes up for it! They have great wraps with their amazing fluffy laffa bread. I was happiest about the falafels and all the vegetarian options they had. I was impressed at the quality and speed of this eatery. I will be returning soon!<//text>

They have a tandoor AND a vertical grill and offer all the middle eastern/Mediterranean goodness that can be made with those.  The pita and larger flatbreads are all made right in view of customers, so you know it's fresh and has a homemade vibe.<//review>< GmapID>

I love the food at Pita Pockets. The quality of the kabob is great and the portions are large which is a plus because most places give more rice and salad than meat. The owner and staff are friendly and I have been coming here for about 1 year.< /text>

The food is pretty good and the prices are very good. You feel a bit heavy when you leave, but don't usually regret it. Try the laffa, it is hard to find elsewhere and is really special. They have vegan options too.<//Review>

The food is perfect. You can actually see them making it rather than taking it out of a can or bag. The people there are also helpful in helping you decide.<//Review>

One of my new fave places.  They give a lot of food and it's also good quality.

Unfortunately they won't sell you Laffa bread.   Don't know of too many restaurants that won't take your money for their food. Isn't that their business?

If I ran a restaurant or a store and ran out of items I would try and make more so I can sell more.< /Review>

Really really like it!
The chicken shawarma was dry to me but with the hummus and sauce it works out.
Bread is really yummy and fresh,  same as hummus.
The manakish has been my favorite thing there so far. Sooo goood, reminds me of a pizza.< /Text>

<text>Best Mediterranean Laffa ever, when I am in the area, I will definitely stop by Pita Pockets. I will always get their Gyros and Chicken Shawarma Laffa, with everything and French fries on it. My wife and I love them so much. They recently increase their price which is understandable because of the increase of minimum wages. Their staffs always have great attitude, very friendly and sometimes funny. I highly recommend this Mediterranean Cafe for a quick casual bite.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

This was my first time there, though I had been meaning to go for awhile. I love falafel pitas so I finally went to Pita Pockets to get one. Disaster. My first mistake was being talked into using laffa bread instead of the usual pita bread. The laffa bread was not fluffy, only thick, very dry and rough. Then there was only maybe a teaspoon of sauce on the sandwich along with a scant amount of shredded carrot  and lettuce, however the supreme
Insult were the falafel balls themselves. Omg, they were not fried, they were mealy, a bit slimy and had absolutely no flavor whatsoever! I only give 1 star to this place because it was clean and the counter person that I dealt with was very friendly. I will never go back to Pita Pockets.<//review>

I have been going to Pita Pockets for over 10 years. The chicken shawarma laffa with french fries is delicious. The house made laffa bread is very good and an item that I have not seen at any other restaurant. I highly recommend Pita Pockets.</text>

This place is a gem. The laffa gyro is huge and stuffed with great tasty ingredients. It costs a bit more than the pita but It's more like a burrito and very large in size.

The feta fries are quite good too. The feta is super smooth, not crumbly.

The staff is very friendly.

They have a Coke soda fountain here too.

While I did enjoy the gyro, I do want to try the falafel next time.

My only gripe is that the seating is mostly 2 person only. You also have the patio which can accommodate more, but is limited.</Review>

I was told about this by a friend of mine and love the small places with great food. I drove the 35 minutes out of my way to try the Lamb Gyro Laffa and it was great.....I hope to return on my next trip into town.< /Review>

Lots of food for the price and very fresh! The Laffa bread is baked daily and so delicious! I love the chicken shwarma or lemon chicken Laffy but always stick to that because I love it so much! Good hummus, as well! Very friendly and family owned<//Review>

Pita Pockets is best known for its lemon chicken. Their lemon chicken is just delicious - especially if you pair it up with their home made lafas; winning combination right there.

It's definitely a lunch establishment. Not fancy, just straight up good food and friendly service.

Can't go wrong with the lemon chicken like I said, but if you want to be more adventurous their shawarma is great too!<//review>

<text>I had tuna salad in a laffa. Laffa was home made and amazing! Yes, the laffa was a tad pricey but well worth it. The service was outstanding! They noticed it was our first time and gave us free drinks! I would recommend this place to every that loves fresh food. I live in AZ and will definitely be returning here.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I have been eating there for years. There is no better falafel in the valley. The shwarma is fantastic and the lamb absolutely delicious. The family are really caring nice people. I have tried every other Mediterranean place in the valley... None compare. This is also one of the only few places that make laffa bread. It is not fancy, but damn delicious.</Review>

I took my 1 year old for her first dental appointment and it was an awesome experience. The office was recommended by neighbors on Next Door app. The staff was fabulous and the dentist was so great with my daughter. They had a lot of great advice and gave encouragement as well. They also explained everything that would be happening. My daughter especially loved the Princess room she was placed in. I’m glad I went and will be using this office for all my daughter’s dental needs. I wish i had a dentist like that growing up!< /text>

We had such an amazing experience at Smile Kingdom. From the billing coordinator at the front counter, to the dental hygienist, to the Dentist himself - everyone was so professional, kind, helpful, and caring. I just transferred my daughter from another kids dentistry that had a really cool playroom and playground, Smile Kingdom definitely had cool elements for kids, but no playground. I was worried my daughter would be disappointed about not being able to play after her visit, but instead she said she loved this dentists office and the people so much she didn’t care about the playground. This was also my little guys first trip to the dentist and he loved it too! He left with a big smile and can’t wait to come back. My daughter even woke up today and said she felt what the dentist told her was true, and she needed to make more of an effort to brush her teeth at night. I was shocked! At the end, they even gave me a couple recommendations for adult dentists in my area. It’s hard to tell after just one visit, time will tell if this is standard for Smile Kingdom, but as of right now - I am hugely impressed and would recommend Smile Kingdom to anyone - especially to those with kiddos that fear or have anxiety about going to the dentist. They really have a heart for kids - and you can’t fake that.</Text>

Amazing!! My 5 year old had check up and office was 60 miles from my home and worth every mile driven. We had surgery for teeth removal for her and she was back to normal next day...awesome dentist and staff is so so sweet!! Thank you all staff for making Tinleigh's dental experience so welcoming and friendly..she loves her dentist. The office is all castles and princesses..what is not to like about that!!! The dentist explained everythjng up front and also after surgery...what a super star!!!</Review>

<text>We had a great experience here. Brought our 4 year old daughter for her first dental visit. She was very nervous but the staff did amazing with her. Explained everything and let her touch the instruments and see how they get before they used them. She did so amazing and it was all because Dr J and the staff were so gentle and sweet to her!< /text><Resp>None</Resp><user_id>108027670802273252792</user_id>< GmapID>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I have taken all three of my little ones here and it has always been an amazing experience. Dr. J was incredibly patient with my 2 year old, and explained what he was doing in terms she could understand. With my 10 year old twin boys he explained what was going on directly to them and then discussed options with me. I love that he doesn't push to do more treatments than necessary and that he is strong on preventive care. My one son did need a couple of fillings, which ended up being a positive experience for him, which is fantastic! The kids love going to the dentist and my little one often asks to go see the dragon doctor!

I also have to mention that the front desk help is amazing, they are always polite and very caring!< /text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1463696090380, 'text': 'Thank you so much!

My son LOVES it here! They are absolutely PERFECT for children! I would recommend them to anyone. After every appointment my son tells me, “Mom, I really like that dentist! He is so cool!” It warms my heart that my son actually wants to go to the dentist! And I have Smile Kingdom to thank for that! If I could give more than 5 stars, I would!<//review>

Took our daughter to her first dentist appointment and we definitely chose the right place! Walking in to the office was like walking into a fairy tale 😀. From the flying dragon, treasure chests and different rooms w/in the castle.

They did a geat job balancing a fairy tale theme and modern day technology to help your child feel at ease. I must say, my daughter's first visit was a success!

The staff is very warm and friendly. Dr. J is very patient, kind, knowledgeable and professional. I highly recommend Dr. J and his staff at Smile Kingdom!< /review>

<Text>I'm really grateful for the time that was put into my son's care by everyone in this office. He had fallen while walking his bike and knocked one of his front teeth out. Since my son is two, I was a wreck! It will literally take years for a new tooth to grow in and it was a painful experience for him.

Dr. J literally was my first choice. We had seen him at iFest and his balloon animals were memorable, but his reviews speak for themselves. He was the quickest Doctor to get back to me personally and set up an appointment. With the help of his wonderful staff of course! He was more thorough over the phone then the ER doctor was in person, right after the accident. We were in good hands. Same for our visit today. I'm so sad for the outcome (one less tooth), but I'm thankful that Dr. J talked me out of getting an expensive replacement that wouldn't work out in the end. This office is not out for your money. They are there because they are passionate about caring for children.

Getting the best care is number one to me. Respect for children comes in second and everyone we came in contact with loves and respects the kids that come into their office. Nothing was forced and nothing was rushed. Everything was on my son's terms and if something didn't work, we tried something else so that my son could feel comfortable. He cried tonight when bedtime came around because we couldn't go back to Dr. J's castle until next month.

It's not just a fun place with balloons, toys, and decorations... (Although that made it so fun and it was really beyond cool!) It's quality care and I'm so glad we got the help we needed. I know my son is in great hands and we already scheduled our next appointment. Thanks so much!<//Text>< Date>

My 4 kids just had their first appointments here. Dr. J and all the staff were friendly and great with kids. Very gentle approach and all my questions were answered.

The office castle theme was really fun. My kids did not want to leave and my 8 year old asked if we could cone back and play the next day haha!<//Text>

Dr. J and his staff are excellent with kids! My son has white coat syndrome and was very mistrustful of anyone touching him. I appreciated Dr. J’s slow approach to gain trust before doing any work. We are half way through the treatment and my son is actually looking forward to his next appointment! I highly recommend Smile Kingdom!

Dr. J and his staff are all so kind, patient, and sincerely caring.  They explained everything to my very nervous and anxious 4 year old, took everything at her pace, and were so sweet to her.

Excellent staff and Dr. J  is so patient and provides gentle care.  We have worked with Dr. J for may years and refer many pediatric patients for dental care to Smile Kingdom. My nephew sees Dr. J, he is 3 years old and loves  the office, it is very kid friendly. I would recommend this office without hesitation to all families looking for a top notch children's dental office.<//text>

<text>Amazing. The staff and Dr. J are phenomenal. We drive from EDH to go there and it is completely worth it. They are honest, kind, and my kids LOVE going to the dentist. My oldest has had a lot of work done and she still loves going there. That's how wonderful Dr. J is with kids. I can't say enough good things about them.<//text></record></dataset><record>

My daughter was deathly afraid of the dentist after multiple bad experiences at another office. I warned Dr. Juarez and his staff, and they COMPLETELY turned my daughters outlook of the dentist around. Even with getting some heavy dental work done, she was giggling through it. They take the necessary time needed with each patient, we feel welcomed every visit, no wait time, after each visit we get a call to check on the patient and won't go anywhere else!< /review>

A very kid-friendly and fun environment. Dr. Juarez is patient and kind and when my toddler was feeling uneasy and uncomfortable, he sang to him during the entire cleaning. My 1 year old, who normally strongly protests having his teeth brushed or even looked at, even let Dr. Juarez scrape off some tartar build up with the scraping tool, all the while being serenaded by the doc. A very positive experience, we highly recommend Smile Kingdom.</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
I had an emergency with my grandson who is eight years old.  The Dentist called me back after hours and had me in the next morning.
Pulled the tooth and fixed the problem
He was so caring and really wanted the best for my grandson
I highly recommend Smile Kingdom<//Review>

On January 18th, 2019, I had an appointment for my 4 year daughter at 2pm. We arrive a couple minutes early, and my daughter was so eager to get inside she couldn't wait for me to park. My daughter never liked doctors or dentists but last time when she went here at age 3 and a half she was SOOOO good. She sat in the chair and let the dentist do whatever he wanted, I even have pictures. My daughter had a very normal morning and didn't exhibit any moodiness to me. I however am 38 weeks pregnant with Hyperemesis and recently had a fall so I gashed open my toe and split the skin open completely. From the day of the appointment I was walking around 3cm dilated and was scheduled to be induced 5 days from that Friday. Im nauseous and limping without a shoe on trying to wrap my foot, and they dont ask me if I'm okay or if I need anything. An overly "energetic" employee comes out and asks my daughter for a picture and that's when the meltdown begins. My daughter knows that they take pictures and they check teeth, after all she's done this since she was 1, but for some reason she was upset (go toddlers!). We go back to the chair and the unnecessarily high pitched employee keeps talking to her like how id talk to my dog, and it visibly made her more and more upset. I at that point was ready to just reschedule, I was unsure why my daughter all of a sudden got so upset and I am currently dealing with a lot of physical issues so I didn't have the time or patience to deal with it. What I wanted for my daughter was to be removed from the situation that's causing her frustration and harm (The dentists office and employees) and just try again another day. They decide to take her back to some "princess room" without asking me or my husband, and I'm hesitant to allow this to continue because I know my own daughter, she was not going to just be okay with the situation and I had no way of fixing it because I was not sure exactly what was wrong, but I knew that the employees are the ones that initiated her tears and her being upset. We get to the room and she's just clearly not having anything to do with these people or having them check, she is old enough to explain herself and let me know what's going on but clearly didn't feel comfortable with them and I was about to reschedule when the doctor cones in. My husband is holding her down in his lap as directed as they chant over her while she's screaming bloody murder begging to be "helped" and promising shell "listen" if they stop. At this point the whole situation was completely abusive and I had trouble even sitting there listening to it. I mean with a toddler in a position she's in while people are chanting over her, it really felt like a sacrifice or a cult ritual, yes--it was that bad. So he says he checked her teeth and she has no cavities, and our disaster of a visit would have been over, except Dr. J decided to put me and my husband down as parents. He decided to tell us, inappropriately and without permission, that he believes her behavior was "completely okay" and essentially told me how to parent my child and justified his reasoning because he "has 4 children" and that means he's all of a sudden a god? I kindly let him know that I appreciated him checking my daughters teeth, but that he has crossed a line and did not need to mention anything related to my parenting, and I also let him know that he has no idea what its like to grow a child, as I'm sitting here trying not to vomit with my gashed open toe and having minor contractions on and off. When I told him essentially that his opinion on my parenting was unwanted his facial expression changed and he was angry.

My daughter love going to the dentist now! Her first  visit to a dentist was elsewhere and she was left feeling uncertain and a little afraid even though it was just a check up.
Her first visit at smile kingdom dental was so exciting she wanted to dress up like a princess to match their theme and the entire staff were just amazing and kind and they helped her have fun.  From picking her favorit flavor of tooth polish to haveing fancy pink sunglasses to wear during her exam!  They have baloones as a prize and Dr J even made her a baloon animal on one of her visits. We a very lucky to be right down the street from them but I would travel a long way to get the wonderful care we receive every time we come in.  My daughter was so excited to earn a gold coin for not having any sugar bugs to use in their great prize tower too!  Her only compliant is that she has to wait 6 months between visits! I would and do recommend smile kingdom dental to my friends!< /text>

Would've gave 5 stars, had the staff not wasted my time today. Initial contact, process & pick up went great. Car was rear ended, Body work came out good. I called yesterday to inform the alignment had worsened. Was told to bring in the car today to test drive. Came in, same stubby lady, starts giving me copies of the suspension check/alignment saying there was (unrelated) front strut issues so they weren't able to re align the car. If it was apparent that they weren't going to work on it, could've just told me that over the phone. I had 2 doctors appointments today, one which I was late too since I was trying to drop off the car as instructed. Could've saved my time and emailed me the papers. Just a heads up for future, anything that doesn't need physical presence, technology has advanced enough that no ones time needs to be wasted.<//text>

I can’t praise Caesars enough for their quality and professional work.  Their customer service is tops. Office staff is friendly and helpful, owner offered me a ride back to Tulare, young man who drove me was so kind. The staff who did a beautiful job on repairs made my car like new. They even cleaned it before returning it to me!
Anyone needing their service won’t be disappointed!
Thank you, Caesars!<//text>

Wonderful customer service! They offered to get me a lift to where i was supposed to rent my car but it was just across they street. They also went out their way to make sure I didn't forget anything important in my car. Even remembered to take off my house keys on my key chain when I forgot. Hands down amazing customer service. I had even gone in upset because the place I was renting a car from had messed up my reservations for a third time. So thank you for being so kind and patient!< /review>

<review>I took my car for dings and shattered windshield. I spoke with Juan.  He was very helpful and professional. My car was completed earlier than expected which is always good.  When I picked up my car  Juan walked me out and explained everything plus they washed and cleaned my car. Thank you Cesares!!<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>Cesare's was great to work with! I brought my car in during the holidays and they provided an accurate, reasonable timeline for repairs.

The absolute best part was that they detailed the care inside and out. I couldn't believe it. It was a wonderful surprise.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I would like to start by saying that the  staff at Cesares Collision Repair were awesome. They were communicative, respectful, helpful, and overall did a great job on my vehicle.
As I was picking up my car, I was pleased to notice that they not only did a great job fixing my car, but they cleaned the exterior and interior of my car and even cleaned my headlights! (Now that's quality service!) Again, the best of the best--I am glad I was able to get my car serviced here.
If  you are someone who needs work done on their car look no further--I  would highly recommend them to anyone who needs work done on their car.
Once again,  THANK YOU to the staff at Cesares Collision Repair doing an amazing job!<//Text>< date>

<Name>Rene Hernandez<//Name><time>1544753946754<//time><Rating>4< /Rating><Text>Excellent customer service. I was sold by the greet I received by Gabriel and the fact that he reassured me that he and this team would take care of the Insurance issues. I put it all in their hands and by golly I had my car back within a week. The reason I  give a 4 start and not a 5 ( as much as i want too) is because they received the wrong part initially which pushed my original due date back therefore having to keep my car and me the rental longer, little to my knowledge the reimbursement for the rental does not cover the insurance I added on the rental therefore leaving me out a couple hundred dollars out. However I am grateful that they did an AMAZING job, left my car like new, literally washed inside and out. (minus the muffler that wasn't leveled which I haven't had a chance to take it in to get it fixed because I live in Porterville and my job keeps me busy. But hopefully the offer still stands. I will be returning soon for a dent repair on my right side. Don't give these guys a second thought, make this your first stop. You won't regret it.< /Text>< pictures>

I'm  Definitely giving Caesar a 5 star review, they did a wonderful job on my Honda, couldn't have asked for anyone to do a better job. Left my car looking brand new again, even detailed it upon pick up. Would recommend to everyone who's in search of professional  work. Thank you Gabriel...< /Review>

Took my car in because my bumper was hit and it came out better than it looked before the accident!!!  Enterprise is right across the street if you need a rental and everyone was really friendly!< /Text>

AAA recommended this auto body shop to me and I'm so glad I went with them. They did an excellent job. Car looked brand new. They even finished early. They kept me informed throughout the whole process. I met directly with the owner both when I dropped off and picked my vehicle up. Thank you for doing such a great job!!They even gave me a gift card for Starbucks 😁 as a thank you gift.< /text>

<text>The worst customer service,  the big gal at the front desk was super rude, so I decided to take my money elsewhere.. I don't like to leave bad reviews but I didn't want to deal with that type of people... I hope the owner sees this review and gets her some training and if she is the owner than I feel sorry for the business they turn away...</text>< Pics>

This family owned and operated business does an absolutely amazing job. I've now used them twice and they truly amaze me! They offer a reasonable price and quality work. I can't say enough good things about this business. They did not put excessive milage on my vehicle when it was in their shop (less then a .5 miles). They had the repair done in 3 days, which amazed me. They have a talented painter, there was no orange peel. The vehicle really looks as though it was never rear ended.

When I picked up the vehicle I was planning to take it to be detailed/cleaned. I was surprised that they detailed the car for me, and they did a great job doing so. This is the place to go for repairs!

If you're looking for an auto body shop, this is the one! Fast quality work at a really good price. The best part is they are family owned and operated so you're helping support your local community!<//review>

I went in on a Saturday and was greeted by Gabe. This man surpassed my expectations on assistance with my car issues relating to a hit and run on my rear bumper about a year ago. He was so great I have an appt 10/13 to drop off my car for the repair.</review>

Gabriel was so helpful and let me tell you these guys go above and beyond for their customers. They detailed my car including the engine I'm pretty sure they could tell Im a mom by all the cherRios in the back seat. So sweet of them. Lastly I lost a ring about 2 months ago & I went to pick up my car & it was sitting in my cup holder they must have found it under my seat! talk about winning.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80952f782d57959b:0x7775edc44f34041a< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>I needed a simple tow and this guy shows up earlier than scheduled and said I need to be there in less than 5 min or he's gone. When I get there, he's complaining about the position of the car in question. He finally gets the car propped up on his truck and then just takes off without saying anything, despite the fact that I clearly stated I needed to follow him to the shop where the car was to be delivered.
The whole experience was odd and just plain rude.< /text><Time>1508781003938</Time><pictures>None</pictures><user>112658417745963948638</user></record>

< Review>
We ate here recently while visiting SD as it was close to our hotel on a rainy cold night. What a lovely experience--very romantic! The restaurant is absolutely beautiful, and our meal was so delicious! We shared a scrumptious salad and the lasagna was surely the best we have ever tasted. There are many restaurants in SD, but we will definitely have to return here on our next visit! for dessert, I got some kind of cherry cheesecake and it was to die for. I can't remember what my friend got for dessert because I was so enraptured by mine!<//Review>

<review>Rating is mainly for food - I thought it was ok. Its also possible that my bar for Italian food is higher having been to Italy recently. Service was very good.< /review>< pics>

Went to try this place out after reading great reviews and awesome updates from the restaurant itself, only to find out it was actually closed. Willing to try again once it reopens.</Text>

Amazing food. Traditional, high quality. They are doing delivery and pickup during COVID and they have some great specials if you check out their social media and website. Was able to get a great deal on a bottle of wine too. The veal is amazing and their desserts are to die for. Highly recommend this place, been around for 30 plus years and they have it down. Support local.</text>

Wonderful experience. We had a four course dinner and dessert that was fabulous. The antipasto was yummy. The eggplant creamy soup was delicious. The steak was tender and cooked perfectly. The selection of 3 pastas was delicious. The creme brulee was superb. Also, the wine was delicious. Overall, a fantastic experience with family and the bridal couple.</text>

My husband and I came to this amazing restaurant this past weekend, for our anniversary. For someone like myself who had been in Italy, I can vouch and say this restaurant makes you feel like you are having dinner in Italy. The atmosphere and the music from the harp made our night so delightful. I also want to say that the customer service was so great, and our server Rachel was super great in informing us about the menu options, she for sure knows the meaning of customer service. If you want a great romantic dinner come to Salvatore's Cucina Italiana.</Review>

This place is fantastic. Everyone meal was so good. The food is rich and hearty. The bread was very good. The service was very good. You are surrounded by white and light grey painted opulence and decor for for a wedding. Just plane delicious. The praline cheesecake was bland and the single thing that wasn't fabulous. If you line Italian, you will love this place.<//text>

Salvatore’s is my favorite Italian spot in San Diego. I’ve lived in downtown San Diego for three years and they are hands down the best Italian spot. Everything is made from scratch and personalize from the sweet little Italian lady (she’s been there for 20 some years).  The happy the hour is legit too. Check out the shrimp scampi. Thank me later</Review>

Staff was polite, attentive, and patient. I had the scampi and my date had the lasagna...both were amazing!

Very romantic and contemporary setting. Relaxing music with dim, ambient lighting. Extremely affordable for the quality of experience.

My number one date spot!!!</Text>

One of the moths eventually ended up in one of our plates, so we couldn’t eat majority of it. Maybe they should start actually caring about the hygiene and deal with the bugs instead of letting them stay and having the customers deal with them. Kind of really annoyed. Food was also very mediocre, definitely not worth the price.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<review>It was such an amazing experience! The atmosphere was incredible, and the food was great, and the manager, David, went above and beyond to make our night memorable. My husband and I went there for our anniversary. I didn't bring my phone, and my husbands phone had died, so we weren't going to be able to get a picture of our special day. He stopped what he was doing, took our picture, and made sure to send it to us right then. It just showed how much he cares about his customers, not just their business.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Easily the worst service ever experienced in any restaurant downtown from start to finish! Staff completely out of sorts how to service a party of 12 leaving us unintended & waiting between any table server's appearance. Food had obviously sat long prior to finally being served & was barely adequate! Shrimp in my meal was tough & beyond over cooked! Nothing fine bout the experience!</review>

We regularly stop at Salvatore's Cucina Italiana store and deli on our way back to Oregon.  We love the deli!  We visited the restaurant for breakfast on our last trip. The omelet was just 'meh', but the servers were friendly.  We'll definitely stop at the deli, but probably not the restaurant.<//Text>

Group of 3.  Every meal was excellent.  Service was attentive but not intrusive.  The Scampi divine, all pasta fabulous, soups and salads excellent.  Cocktails - ask for a Rye Old Fashioned- yummy.  Wine list by the glass very good; by the bottle even more extensive.  Good stuff!  Just go!<//review>

<review>I had an amazing 21st birthday experience at Salvatore's Cucina Italiana! The staff were very welcoming and friendly, and made my birthday very special. The harpist surprised me with the birthday tune and the waiter surprised me with a very delicious slice of cake. The food was incredible, for a very reasonable price, and my whole party enjoyed it. I shall definitely recommend this place to my friends in San Diego!<//review>< pictures>

Elegant, romantic, yet unstuffy ambiance. We were warmly greeted upon entry. Service was spot on, attentive but not overbearing in the least. The server was knowledgeable about the menu and the history of the restaurant, and was more than accomodating when my husband ordered a traditional Italian dish off menu. The food was impressive, great flavor. I wished I had ordered a full portion of my pasta. Homemade ricotta was a delightful finish. Great find!< /text>

Expensive, high markup on the wine (80 for a 20 dollar bottle) but great food and service. You pay for the ambiance, and live, romantic music. There was a young man playing piano< /Text>

Great service at this place; although the decor was a bit outdated and garrish . . . . although, perhaps to some that is part of the charm.  The food overall was pretty good; however, the wait staff really pushed the "classic"/"favorite" dish, which was was good, but not worthy of all of the praise heaped upon it . . . . nor the cost.  Some of the other entrees served at our table of 10 were much better (I did sample a few); although the prices were a bit high for what you got.<//text>

<text>Excellent service, the best food (we had meatballs for an entree, lasagne and ossobucco for dinner and the vanilla cake and vanilla and chocolate gelato - all of which we eagerly finished!) and the atmosphere was amazing.<//text>< Date>

Best italian food I have had in San Diego! It's a very nice atmosphere and great classic italian dishes. The osso bucco is ridiculously good, I have also had the lasagna and it is incredible. Great staff that are very attentive and helpful!

I love this place, and highly recommend it!< /Text>

< Review>
This review is for the coffee shop part.

This is true espresso bar with great quality. I enjoy lighter/medium roast espressos and they have that. They took extra care for making a shot with good solid crema. I recommend this for espressos and keep going back.

The staff was welcoming and well serving.

There are enough of outside seating.

They down side that they close the espresso bar before they close the skate board side. If shop was to close at 6pm then bar closed 3:20pm already. The store hours does not reflect that and could make a trip that does not end with great cup of espresso.</Review>

< Review>
Grab a seat in the sunshine beaming down the Paseo with a fantastic cup of tea or coffee, be it drip, espresso, or cappuccino—all in a legendary skate shop in the heart of downtown San José. Be sure to say hello to Bob, a local legend and purveyor of quality beans and boards. It's a perfect spot to people watch and to support a truly local business.<//Review>

< Review>
Awesome central location skate shop on this spot for more than 20 years. Decks & all the gear you need as well as shoes, clothes, caps skate apparel too.

Great coffee at the adjacent shop  with compostable cups & lids, cool pics on the walls and lots of natural light from the big glass windows everywhere.

Interesting health and #sustainability feature is that there's no dairy milk on offer only oat or  almond milk if needed with coffee. #vegan #plantbased

So much nicer to buy gear and coffee here than inside a shopping mall.</Review>

<Text>I haven’t really skated in like 5-7 years and I have walked by this place a hundred times. What a mistake I should have gone in the moment I saw it. Immediately was felt welcome and comfortable. Bob was incredibly nice and knowledgeable. Being a very tall and big guy he knew what I needed and recommended things even if he didn’t have them in stock. All I can say is that I will be going back for anything I need skating wise and next time I’ll try out the cafe .<//Text>< pics>

My wife and I were introduced to Bob who provided us with the most memorable customer service experience! He met us at the door, got to know us and opened the door as we departed. I can honestly say this was a Top 5 customer service experience in my lifetime. How my other places can you go, where after 5-10 minutes you feel like you have known someone for years? I will now go out of my way to go back to Circle-A and you should too. Just for the experience! New businesses should go or send new employees just for training! The shop has skateboard memorabilia and very cool off major label clothing and product like 101, curb nerd, etc. Thank you Bob for making up for all of the poor customer service experiences prior to this visit!< /Text>< pics>

<Text>While heading towards the Post Office from the ABC office on Thursday morning, we saw an espresso machine through a window of the Circle-A skate shop. Which was curiously surprising.
Who would have thought that a skateboard retail space would have the best espresso in San Jose?
They use a serious Slayer LPX 2 group espresso machine with a bottomless portafilter, which I have never seen used in person. It only does double shots, but since we were getting quadruple shot Cappuccinos, it didn't matter.
The young gentleman new his craft and even though they didn't have milk or cream, he boasted the Oat milk/cream, which was just as tasty without killing the flavor of the espresso. Deeeeeelish!
Well done!< /Text></record>

I was really disappointed with my experience. I spent 70 dollars on a skateboard deck only to have it break in 2 days on a warm up trick. I’ve been skating for 5 years and have never seen anything like this happen. I’m not heavy either(roughly 130 pounds). I went in to the shop hoping to get a replacement deck or at least some money back but was told that nothing could be done. Horrible customer service.< /Text>
<pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1587603008962, 'text': "Sorry, but like I said Nathaniel, no one would replace that board. Your board was clearly broken with NO defect showing. Had there been a separation in between the plies due to an air bubble in the glue spreading process things would be different, the board MFG would replace it for you. I simply saved you time and money by stating exactly what the Board Company would tell you. To back my knowledge in this situation, I've not only ran this retail store since 1997 but started Circle-A the brand as a board MFG(with my own wood shop) in 1986 and I have a personal relationship with the current top wood shops in the business today including the one that pressed your board with 5 straight grains and 2 cross grains of hard rock maple from the Great Lakes region of Vermont. So, if this is your first board break, I applaud you for your good luck because as you MUST know almost anybody that's been skateboarding(not longboarding) for five years has landed wrong and broke there board. As far as calling me out for horrible customer service, that is messed up. I was in the middle of helping another customer when you approached me with your deck in hand and I gave YOU my attention immediately. I'm sorry if that was not the answer you wanted to hear but it was the truth!\n\nAll I can tell you is: Bolts Kid! Land Bolts! #maybewatchsomeshaneoneill\nIt's All Love,\nBob"}< /Response><Gmap_id>0x808fccbbd18aa865:0x53ec7b75291f7eae< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

One of the best cups of coffee I’ve had. I drink Coffee daily and this place has it figured out. Great shop for Skateboards, Shoes, Shirts, Hats. Bob is one awesome guy. He’s a skate legend who shows respect to everyone. Must see place in San Jose.<//Review>

<Review>Was happy to get an appointment for today and went in to get a hair cut.  My first since Covid hit and was happy to be the only one in there and she sanitized once the prior customer left.   My prior beautician  closed her business so after 20 yr had to find a new place.  I showed her a picture of what my style was like before it grew out and she nailed it and I feel so much better and after not getting a cut for over a year.  I'll definitely go bad.🤗☺️< /Review>< pictures>

I have the worst hair cut in my life for only 20 bucks. So not worth it. Uneven chopped up hair. The lady was very lost throughout the entire time and couldn't even style it at the end. She was so desperate that she asked the other lady what to do. She cut 4 inches after I told her I want to let my hair grow long. Not coming back..
Update: After 2 months my hair still look aweful, uneven and choppy. I wake up every morning so unhappy about my hair. I regret going to this place. Avoid Tasha. The end.<//review>

This place is top notch for me :). My stylist is the #1, Elizabeth. She always cuts my hair and like always, she does an amazing job. All the staff is very friendly and genuinely care about your hair cut. Carmelita also does a wonderful job and is EXTREMELY friendly and can keep up a good conversation going and she's a REAL ONE :)</review>

< Review>
Its hard to review a barbershop because while their may be some good barbers here, the one I got a few days ago was HORRIBLE. She couldn't understand what I wanted to do with my hair and she cut it UNEVEN!
I had to go to another place to fix it up after so I ended up paying for 2 haircuts. What a waste of my time and money. Stay away from the older big black lady if you must come here.< /Review>

omg... i read the reviews, but was desperate because she was leaving town & our regular lady was unavailable. the person started nice, but my daughter was in tears as the cut went on saying that she was being rough w/the brush. she's never cried over a hair cut. i also tried to tell the woman that her hair is thick & curly so it must be wet when cut, that it needed to be washed first, but she kept spraying it w/water & telling me she would wash it @ the end (a $5 charge). we left & the next day when it was all dry, my daughter yells from the bathroom "my hair!!" i came in & it was crooked. the one side cut more than an inch off the other. one side @ her neck where we wanted it & the other up @ her ears. i took her back right away to fix it & the woman tries to blame my daughter for not sitting still. she is 10yrs old, not a toddler, she sits more still than i do. then out came the spray bottle & i told her, no it has to be saturated & she wants to charge me for another wash. i said absolutely not, you ruined it, you fix it. she still argued with me. TERRIBLE experience. my daughter & i will never trust anyone else.</Review>

If I could give zero stars I would. Very disappointed in services provided to me by Monica the hairdresser. She over processed my hair leaving the hair dye on too long. Monica bleached my hair for highlights and it resulted in a big unpleasant unprofessional mess. I wish I could upload pics but since I can’t I will warn you to never go. Monica is untrained and inexperienced. I’m embarrassed and ashamed to go out in public due to her ruining my hair. She recommended re-dyeing my hair black after she just bleached for highlights as a solution what a joke.<//review>

Customer service is very poor. The stylist are very unfriendly. This place needs a serious makeover in just about everything that makes for a successful buisness.</review>

I always had good haircut experience but tonight this lady named Carmelita was by far the worst experience. She gave me attitude and she jabbed me with her clippers.  Lazy fat rude lady. Fire this lady</text>

<Review>Went in two days ago at 8:30PM. I was a walking. The person that gave me my haircut seem like someone would know how to cut hair for other people but no clue on mens hair cut. It was like shearing a goat. I showed her an example as to how I want my hair cut even after that she just butchered my hair. No scissors no wetting the hair just shearing. Stay away from her has light purple hair never gave me a name so can't name her but short light purple hair. I guess just anyone can become a barbar these days....</Review><time>1405700954156< /time><Pics>None</Pics><rate>1< /rate><name>Amir Khan<//name><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c2b581c63483c7:0x73526fcebaaa4b53</gmap_id>< user_id>

2 times in a row they said no wait and kept me waiting. Today they said there were 2 call a heads in front of me but neither one of them were there so they could take me in five minutes. So instead they left me sitting there for 10 minutes and started taking the people that were walking in AFTER me. When I said something about it the girl said to another stylist "I told her there were two people in front of her" (which was a lie because she already told me they'd take me because the call aheads werent there) and she did this in front of the other customers which was embarrassing. I will NEVER come back here.</text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Redondo 7 has got to be the best nail salon I've ever went to, hands down. The first two photos with the street background was taken on March 26, 2021 and the last two photos with the room background was taken 5 weeks after!
The service here is incredible and they treat you like you're a priority. When you first walk in, you're immediately greeted by Raymond and the other nail technicians which makes you feel oh so welcomed. Michelle did my nails to perfection and she took her time to make sure they looked amazing. These people know what they're doing and they're perfect at what they do!< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
I love Redondo 7 Nails. I followed Raymond from shop to shop because of his work ethic, personality and professionalism. When he opened up his own place, Redondo 7, I haven’t gone to anywhere else since.
Michelle does my nails and she is a blessing. My nails are thin, flat and flexible. When ever I’ve gotten full sets, they always pop off within a week. With Michelle, they last 2-3 weeks! That is a miracle for me. She’s so gentle on my hands and is a stickler for detail. I won’t let anyone else do my nails but her.
The color selection they have is ridiculous. They have any and every color you could think of. Mermaid, color changing, glitter, cat eye, metallic, you name it they’ve got it. I love that I can come in and and just pick any color off the color wheel. Michelle and Raymond will also help you out wit picking a color that will go well with your skin tone.
If you’re looking for a a clean, professional, energetic, creative, happy place for your nails, Redondo 7 Nails is where you want to be.<//Review>

I’ve been getting my nails done for years and I can whole heartedly say that Redondo 7 Nails is thee BEST place to go to in Long Beach. This hidden gem has become my go to place for the last year and a half, I am so glad they are open again.

Raymond and his staff are the most welcoming and sweet people. They cater to every one of their clients, from new customers to loyal returners. Even with the pandemic , they have taken all the measurements to ensure a safe, clean and excellent environment for us all. Masks are required for all, they have barriers between the technicians and customers and they limit how many customers are in the shop at a time to provide social distancing.

As you can see below, I have been to Redondo 7 Nails numerous times and I’m always very satisfied with my set. Michelle is my girl and she always does a phenomenal job. My set usually last 3weeks to a month before I need a fill again !!!
I cannot recommend this nail shop more.</review>

Clean, professional, friendly. Raymond and his staff are wonderful. They are like family to me. They always welcome me with open arms and do an excellent job every time. They care very much about their customers and always go the extra mile to make sure you are satisfied. Small family owned business. I highly recommend.
Thank you Raymond & Michelle. See you soon.<//text>

Raymond and Michelle are absolutely phenomenal. Very friendly atmosphere. I haven't been to a nail salon that I've been so impressed with in a LONG time - and I've been getting my nails done for upwards of 10 years. My nails were made to the perfect shape and size (almond shape and medium-long length). I also wanted an ombre dip and it came out beautifully. I've never been to a place that hit all of my criteria so well. I'm from out of town and I promise you, if it wasn't for the travel I would come back every damn time!</Review>

In all of my years of getting pedicures, I have never gotten such great service as I do at Redondo 7 Nails. I used to think I had ingrown toe nails, and that's why my toes would hurt with tight shoes....at least that's what all the pedicure people would tell me in the past. Well it wasn't true! It was just built up dead skin along the nails of my big toes. That's how awesome this nail salon is. After going to them regularly for a year, my toe pain stopped coming back. They healed my feet. They're so good that even though I just moved out of state, I still plan to come back to get my pedicure whenever I'm in town.</Text>

<Text>This nail salon is the best. They're very nice, and they do a wonderful job with taking care of my hands and feet. My daughter referred me here, and because they do such a great job, I drive 20 min from home just to get my mani/pedi. They're worth the drive for the quality work they do!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<review>I saw the positive reviews and had to see for myself. To my surprise Raymond was very attentive and positive attitude. I called to schedule an appointment he was very polite and friendly.  I went in there with ingrown toenails painful and he removed them instantly and it was a gentle removal. He’s truly an expert. Definitely recommend!

Clean, organized, friendly service, variety of goods, lots of photos, and more.  I tried this bakery for the first time.  I enjoyed their croquette, and it was of one the best I've had so far.  Just reviewed their photos, and I will be visiting again in a few days to try lots more.  It's a great place for a quick meeting or mingle.< /Text>

<Review>Great coffee buns. My wife and I had not been here in quite sometime, and brought back old memories when we used to come saturday morning just for the coffee buns! Had not been off on a Saturday for a while and felt good to spend the morning enjoying a coffee with a coffee bun!</Review><Rate>5</Rate><UserId.>113494471021185238017<//UserId.></record>

This bakery is an absolute delight and I always stop in for their red bean buns! Their green tea crepe cake was light and creamy. Everyone I've seen working there has a smile and happy to help recommend new treats. One of my favorite places! The also do special order cakes (wedding, birthday) and have some high end sweet boxes at the front of the store that make amazing gifts.<//Text>

If you're going to use a debit card, you'll have to meet an unposted minimum purchase requirement. I just wanted to buy a slice of cake ($4) for my daughter but I was told that I would need to also buy some gift cards to meet their minimum. As a consumer, I prefer to purchase only and exactly what I want and I don't appreciate being told that I need to buy more than that. It was very crowded and very difficult to find parking. Perhaps they don't care if they lose business from new customers but they did lose mine.<//Review>< gmapID>

This place is a bit humbler than some of the other Asian bakeries in the neighborhood, but in my opinion their actual baked goods are better than 85 degrees or Paris Baguette. Less of a selection than you'll find at 85, but more or less the same as at PB. What sets them apart is their coffee buns, doughy buttery things with carmelized sugar coating the outside. They're constantly bringing out fresh ones - get one and eat it while it is hot!</text>< Rate>

<Review>Staffs are ill-mannered and cake is so small and expensive.
Their tiramisu is not tiramisu. Awful!!!
I only come here cuz this is walking distance from the restaurants I like.
If you go, just have coffee. Don't eat cakes. So expensive and poor quality.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I started going to Leo Fit lab when I needed to loose some weight and tone up for my daughters wedding.  I was given a weight goal by Riley ( which I hit before the date)  and got lots of great personal training from Kayla.  They are both great to work with. The workout is so easy and fun!! I love doing the Vasper machine and seeing my weekly results on the ARX Machines!  I highly recommend this  Fitness for anyone, no matter what age!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Perfect location and lots of parking. State of the air equipment. 5/5 for being clean and covid friendly. Personal training sessions at an affordable price. Always feeling like my body got a great workout. Brought my partner and he loves it too!! Will definitely continue working out here and highly recommend!</Review>< Pics>

Kayla and Riley are the best! This gym gives great one on one training and the machines are amazing. I can track my progress and push myself to be better than my last workout. I have to mention the glute machine which is my favorite! Give that a try for sure!</text>

He was very thorough and explained every step and the purpose of it. As he was working with me, he welcomed new customers and helped them get prepared for their workout. He bounced between both of us and gave detailed attention to everyone. I enjoyed the equipment and excited to try some new ones next time.

<text>Wow! stumbled into this place on accident. The adaptive distance training is for me!!! Not being a “fitness” person I find these 30 minute training sessions are perfect. Riley does a great job getting updated equipment and working new things into my ARX work out. I love being able to track my progress on the ARX website. They’ve been super flexible with my schedule and the strength I’ve gained I one short month has helped reduce my chronic lower back pain. Kayla is also a great trainer motivating me through every set. everything is clean and sanitized.  Essentially it’s private training with maybe one other person in the gym. The best investment is in your health and I would say it’s money well spent here!<//text>< Pics>

<text>Today was my first work out with the best trainers ever. I suffer from lower back pain and have always been sacred or working out with a trainer do to past experiences. I was very apprehensive to try Leo Fit for that reason. From the start I let the trainers know and they listened Rylie and Kayla are the best they took all the measures to make sure I received not only a good work out but a safe and secured one as well. I am very excited to continue my work out goals at this facility. I highly recommend coming in and giving this two wonderful trainers and opportunity to show you what personalized training is all about. I am so happy and excited thank you both Rylie and Kayla for giving me back the trust in working out!!!!

I am amazed that you can get such a good work out in such little time. The science and efficiency behind it  is cutting edge. There are no short cuts in getting fit. You are still putting in the work, but utilizing everything modern technology has to offer. And working out in a private gym is perfect in these times.< /review>

I am 75 and have been interested in fitness and wellness for most of my adult life. I still compete in bodybuilding competitions around the country. As a hobby I have studied most of the science of body composition and re composition and have experimented with most of the techniques  and equipment as they were developed and joined virtually every new gym that was available in San Diego since 1968,from the hard core weight rooms of the YMCA to the mega facilities  of 24hr and LA Fitness and in between.
What I discovered when I stumbled on to LeoFit Lab was that they are the only facility in San Diego to have the new state of the art machines that truly provide for the most effective body re composition in the least amount of time--as little as 20 minutes a week. The progress is accurately tracked and reported by computer. the machines are safe and effective for anyone from a 25 yr old bodybuilder  to an 85 yr man or woman. The programs are more effective both from a results and cost standpoint  than the "super slow" or "perfect  workout" or private personal trainer approaches available.

<Review>Its a time saver if your time is important, i do 25 minutes a week for a full body with higher results than the regular gym
A lot to explain, you will need to set yourself for a free session and Riley or Jonathan will explain it to you
PS..you will not need to change your clothes and you will not be sweating!<//Review>< Pics>

Before I came here I was unmotivated to work out, but the fast workout of (30-45) minutes was something I was really looking for. It literally is equivalent to 3-4 days training in just 30 minutes. Also the incredible staff here such as Riley and Kayla are always here to help you achieve your goals and keep pushing you. I 100% reccomend coming here. It is the best gym I have ever been to.</Review>

Being a personal trainer and in the fitness industry for over 10 years I’ve tried many different fitness trends / fads always looking for new workout devices which can help to maximize strength, increase lean muscle mass and performance as well as enhancing your body’s endurance.

I have been to many state of the art “high tech fitness studios” many with very unique equipment helping to take you to the next level, however when I came across Leo’s fitness labs - I was truly mind blown.

The ARX machine which focuses on time under tension , and putting the main focus on the eccentric portion of the exercise is one of a kind.

I’ve NEVER felt such an intense as well as time efficient workout in my life before ! 20 minutes after starting I was completely flushed of my energy which is insane ! My workouts never go for less than 45 minutes at the very least. Leaving the fitness lab , I was shocked to see what a pump I had going on.

The soreness was very intense just the way I like it - no need to let that scare you off , the intensity of the workout is only as hard as you like it to be , meaning your only working against your own resistance you apply. The trainers RIley and Kayla are great, very knowledgeable and friendly , pushing you to go past your limits.

Highly recommend this gym (better said fitness lab ) to anyone who is looking for an intense workout, incredible results along with an amazingly strong and toned physique .</Text>

For someone like me who's always on the go, Leo's Fitness Lab is the right gym to fit your workout into your busy schedule. Jon is very personable, interactive, and knowledgeable. I've truly never seen or used equipment like the ones here. The ARX machine is seriously top-notch; I was able to see the intensity rate I was going at. It definitely tested my force, strength, and power. Jon guided me and pushed me past my mental barrier. Unlike other trainers I've hired and experienced working with, Jon actually cares about your health, well being and results! 10/10 would recommend to family and friends.<//Text>

One of the best workouts I’ve had in a while! I workout all the time at your average free weight gyms and would consider myself quite strong, but after the workout I had at Leo’s Fitness Lab, I had never felt so weak. In a good way! The staff and the advanced equipment really push you to your limits. A point I never really reach just working out at my regular gym. Jon was the personal trainer that put me through the workout and he really knew his stuff. I 100% recommend trying this gym out and make sure to ask for Jon to be your trainer!<//Review>

want to start by saying that I am 52 years old, I have had two disc replacements in my neck. At one point I felt like I couldn't find a workout that worked for me, with my injury, my age and how much time I could spend working out to get the results I was looking for.
I found the perfect solution! Leo's Fitness Lab.
I am in my skinny jeans in 8 weeks,  I get ask all the time from my friends " what is your secret ?"
I work out two sessions twice a week for 20 minutes that's it! I haven't felt better in over in 20 years. This is the best kept secret!
I want to scream from the rooftops to share this with everyone. There are so many health benefits from this type of resissant train...  the list goes on. All I can say is go try it ! it speaks for itself.<//text>

I have never been an athletic person. I have always hated working out and never found a way to incorporate fitness into my life, until I found Leo Fit! Only having to work out once a week to see results had made Leo Fit easy to fit into my life style and the wonderful personalized service provided by both trainers (including text reminders it time to work out) has kept me accountable to my  commitment to my self. I love Leo Fit!</review>

<Review>I have been working out here for a short time and am already seeing and feeling amazing results.  I was skeptical at first, but after my first workout, I was sold.  The machines are genius.
I have a horrible back and have for most of my life.  I used to lift weights regularly, but have gained a lot of weight as an adult.  Mostly due to immobility from back pain.
This workout helps build muscles without hurting my back.  The way it is set up and because of the technology used, it is virtually impossible to put too much stress on my back while doing the most effective muscle workout I have ever tried.
Building muscle has helped a lot with my metabolism and mobility.  I highly recommend to anyone looking for better health.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I have worked out for 35 years. I am the proverbial gym dweller. It was hard for me to think working out once or twice a week for 20 minutes would be as effective as pumping iron 3-4 days a week. I was wrong!  This workout pushes you to the limits and is far more effective than a traditional workout!!

Come in and try it out (1st session free) you will be impressed!!</Review>

Your entire workout is spent with a friendly and helpful trainer urging you on, and keeping you focused.  Your workout is specific to your needs and particular capabilities, and your progress is automatically recorded and incorporated into the settings for your next workout.  20 minutes twice a week is all it takes to build muscle.<//text>

<review>This workout is like nothing I have ever done.  I am not a fan of working out and spending hours at a gym nor pushing myself hard.  The workout I have been doing the last few months  is only for 20 minutes a week so well suited to my schedule.  I truly can tell that I am building muscle and losing fat while also actually enjoying the workout.  I find the ARX machine fun because you can see if you are improving every week by the statistics it records.  Almost like a video game.  You gotta try it for yourself to see.</review>< name>

As a result I feel like I have good overall endurance but l am plateauing, appear "skinny fat" and lack strength. I get overwhelmed at the gym and don't always know if I am doing the weight training properly on my own when I do try it. I discovered LeoFit and couldn't be happier with the results. You are basically getting personal training so they help you through every step on the machines and you get a very intense workout. The workout only took 20-30 minutes and my whole body was worked! I have been going once a week for a little over two months and I have seen big changes in my body already. I have more muscle and each time I come in I can compare to the last workout so I can see that I am getting stronger. Highly recommended!< /review>< pics>

<Review>I love, love, love this way to exercise and Leo’s fitness Lab is the answer I received after months  of research. Multiple  injuries told my body that I needed a rest from hours spent at the gym  lifting weights with questionable forms that I maintained to compensate the pain I was experiencing.
I read a lot about the Vasper System and the ARX machines, and if you are into bio hacks and time optimization these tools are going to work you out,  make you strong and change your body composition.
21 minutes on the Vasper Machine will give you physiological results comparable to a couple of hours of intense cardio workouts. 30 minutes on the ARX machines are going to challenge your
Muscles session after Session. I also did the metabolic test and the body fat test in the Body Pod.
These two test confirmed my need to lose body fat while going back to eat way more calories I was eating before. So I have a long road ahead but I am confident that Riley and Kayla will help me get where I want to be; they  are great motivators and always available to answer the million questions I keep asking. This place is for you no matter your age and your fitness status!!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>This training experience is amazing. It’s short, to the point and exhausting. I emphasize “exhausting.”  I have been heavily involved with weight training my entire adult life. Multiple gym memberships, kettlebells, CrossFit, and I am a daily practitioner of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ).  My BJJ training forces me to seek ways to gain maximum strength without gaining tremendous size and weight such that I am elevated to higher weight classes.  When Mr. Hamel first told me of this training system, and emphasized that I would only need to train approximately 20 minutes, one day a week, I was skeptical to say the least. Coming from the old school meathead mentality that I needed to be in the weight room pumping iron and grunting it out 2 hours a day 5 days a week, the notion of training once a week, hitting my entire body and actually gaining strength seemed ridiculous.  That was until I did the first work out. My mind was blown. I was exhausted after 20 minutes, and I felt like I had just worked my entire body with a maximum level of efficiency. It was unbelievable. I have trained every week, once a week for 20 minutes and my strength has gone up over 20%. (That is the beauty of these machines, they actually measure your progress down to the level of resistance, and the maximum amount of weight you are pushing.) This is the epitome of training smart. I’m not training to be a bodybuilder so I can stand in a front of a mirror covered in tanning butter, rocking a banana hammock and flexing. Nor am I, as someone who wears a suit every day to work,  wanting to look like some swollen doorman standing outside of a Gaslamp nightclub. So, while my strength has noticeably increased, I am more lean and flexible than ever and my core strength and lower back strength is absolutely off the charts. I highly encourage anyone, including those most skeptical to give this a try. Just once. (Unless of course, you just enjoy the social aspect of the gym, standing around talking, waiting for machines, and looking at yourself in the mirror. If that’s what you are about, knock yourself out -  there are plenty of other places to go for that silliness.) But if you are serious about wanting to work your entire body, make amazing strength gains, minimize the amount of time it takes to do so, be exhausted after every training session, and be able to see measurable results every time you train, this is for you.< /review></record>

<Review>I can't say enough about this place. I order it consistently for my painting crew. They're ceviche mixto is amazing. Highly recommend this place. The service is beyond reproach always friendly and attentive. Carmelita is far and away my favorite server. I wish I could give more stars. Try the ceviche you won't be disappointed.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

If I could give no stars I would. Asked for an appetizer never received it. Asked for our appetizer a few times never received it. Ordered our food. Never received it. Never received anything. Couldn't have made us feel more out of place. All of the other tables were getting service immediately. We just got to sit there and be ignored. WILL NEVER BE GOING BACK!!!! Dont recommend this place unless you're ok with being ignored.< /text>

<review>Was in town visiting family and we all went here.  I am from SoCal, and I think if you from anywhere in California and nearby, you know good Mexican food, or at least you should.  This is pretty good Mexican food, and I absolutely loved the Michelada they serve.  The staff was pretty friendly.  I hope to stop by here again the next time I am in town.<//review>< pics>

Very delicious.  Service was exceptional.  The guy that waited on us was very friendly.  The restaurant was also clean.  The beans were a bit salty, rice, enchiladas and tacos were excellent!  Very big portions.< /review>

Usually tree his is our go.to spot. I don't what happened but I was disappointed. My rice was crispy like if it sat in the warmer way too long and crisped the sides. My sons carnitas were way over done. I'll try again just becasue I have never had a bad experience before. Hopefully it was a one time bad experience.< /review>

Slow service and no respect from the waitresses. I am a white man who speaks conversational Spanish. I make an effort each and everyday to only order and communicate in Spanish at Mexican restaurants. Even after asking in Spanish for Spanish only the young waitresses  didn't honor my request. If someone is making an effort to learn and speak your language, treat them with respect no matter what their color is. It's not rocket science to recognize someone is trying.</text>

< Review>
Not very good. The service was attentive and prompt. The two young ladies that served us were fine but the food is a different story.

Rice was bland. Guac just plain ol not good. The Enchiladas and beans tasted like something out of a t.v dinner. Not impressed at all by their food to be honest. Prices a little higher than other mex restaurants that serve the same thing but better. My gf however loved the Sope that she ordered. Maybe it was just what i ordered.

Inside is nice and clean so no issues there. Absolutely no repeat for me. Very disappointing.</Review>

<review>There food is great don't get me wrong but in times of Covid they have been slacking for orders. Specifically, on door dash. I have had more than three times where they just cancel your order like why are you guys even on DoorDash? Change your schedule so people know when they can order!! It's frustrating</review>< pictures>

Use to be a very good Mexican restaurant. I’m not sure what happened but the quality went way down hill. Just another average Mexican restaurant in Chico now. Only good thing about this place is if you want a quick meal you can go here because the place is usually empty.</review>

I ordered a carnitas burrito,  with no extras and it totaled $10 and some change. I was excited because of the positive rating on Google but what I got was less than exciting. The burrito was very small the sour cream and guacamole that was supposed to be inside was instead served on the side. as you can see in the pic,  my first bite was extremely unpleasant. There was what I can best describe as a wooden branch about 2.5 inches long inside my burrito. It was too hard to be a tomato vine - hard enough to hurt my mouth when I bit into it. After thoroughly checking the rest of the burrito I decided to continue eating. The tortilla was really good,  however the only other contents were rice (I ordered no beans)  meat and a few pieces of tomato. The carnitas was extremely salty and nothing else had any flavor. I asked for hot salsa,  which might have saved the meal in terms of flavor,  but none was given. I've had $5 taco truck burritos that were 10 times better. The price matched with the quality of the product means I'll likely not try this restaurant again. If you do, beware of foreign objects and make sure you get what you asked for. Good luck!< /Review>

Authentic, fresh, we portioned and less $ than downtown Chico.. possibly all of Chico.
First time here. My wife and are were suprise and impressed! The decor is very new and clean but not as extravagant as others. But you won't mind.< /review>

Tried this place last week for the first time because we saw it had high reviews and we were not disappointed! I've been talking about it all week.

The interior was super clean and well-decorated, the food was fresh and absolutely amazing, and our waiter was very kind and attentive. We went at around 11am and it wasn't too crowded, but by the time we were leaving it was filling up fast.

I don't remember the prices, but I'm sure they weren't outrageous. Probably a little on the expensive side, but totally worth it. Can't wait to go back!</text>

I loved the catfish fillet I tried, although it was a bit on the greasy side. The chips and salsa were great, but the rice had frozen veggies in it, and that's just not acceptable to me. The refried beans weren't bad, but I've had better. Will go back to try other things for sure. My two friends enjoyed their meals.</Text>

<text>I chose this restaurant for a birthday dinner tonight since it had 4.3 rating.  We showed up with a group totaling 6 adults at 8:10pm. The restaurant closes at 9:00pm.  The hostess right away said as we waited to be seated "oh, i think our kitchen is closed now, but let me ask".  Comes back and we ask if they're closed "yes, I'm sorry". Definitely not going to try going back to try this place.</text>< pictures>

The food was decent. And the service was almost nonexistent. I had the carnitas plate with rice and beans. The rice and beans were good but the carnitas were a little on the salty side and dry. I would have given this place an extra 2 stars if our waitress was actually giving us service and not busy sitting at a  table flirting with her boyfriend.  At one point she had us waiting for 20 minutes before she took our order because she was 3 tables away sitting down entertaining her her boyfriend.  After she took our order she never returned and we sat there for about 30 minutes before someone else finally came over to bring us the bill. This place really needs to pay attention to the amount of service they're providing.< /Text>

< Review>
I stopped by on Sunday, it's the best food that ever entered my mouth. I had the chile rellenos, I ordered one and that was plenty since it was served with rice and refried beans, which were the best tasting rice and beans I have ever had. I was not going to stop in because the website said small plates, well, they need to take that down because there wasn't anything small about my plate. The service was great as well, I will definitely go back.</Review>

The food was delicious: costal seafood dish and a traditional dish. Good thick chips and chunky salsa.
The interior looks great; we hadn't seen the new interior since they moved two doors over.<//text>

Stood in line again to get chips. Had to buss my own table before siting down. Chips are stale , salsa so watered down it barely coats a chip. 10 servers  aimlessly running around between two buildings trying to place one small plate at a time.</Text>< Date>

We heard great things about the seafood here...but our food was really terrible. We got a shrimp burrito that cost $12, and all that was in it was lettuce, plain white rice, and shrimp in a white sauce. The mariscos relleno was really greasy and tasted like the canned tomatoes you get from Costco. Both plates were very bland. Maybe we just didn’t pick the right dishes...but I doubt we’ll be back.< /review>

<Text>I would give it 4 stars if they de-veined the shrimp for the cocktails. A black line down the spine is gross. I deveined myself. Flavor of the shrimp cocktail, though, is really good...just like the places down in East LA. Good memories from familiar tastes. Note: to get the best flavor add 2 tablespoons ketchup and A few dashes of Tapitio...to your threshold. That's LA style. Enjoy!<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>Mom and I went to this place for lunch yesterday 5/23/18 since it was the only place close enough to our CISR class. We told them we were in a hurry and they made sure to get our order in ASAP. We both got the carnitas tacos plate with rice and beans. OMG, it was the BEST carnitas we have ever had! And we are carnitas fanatics! Even the rice and beans were fabulous. The service was very friendly and they were super accommodating to us with our time limit. Everything was delicious and we will DEFINITELY be back again! New favorite place!!!< /Review>< pics>

Just had a delicious shrimp chile relleno there as well as my hubby's beef taquitos everything was wonderful from the chips and salsa to the beer everything tasted fantastic and the staff is very friendly. My only complaint is that the shrimp on my chile relleno we're very tiny and very few, as in three. That being said, I will definitely be going back!< /review>

<review>We're new to Chico. Have tried 5 other recommended Mexican restaurants and have finally found an authentic one with a good cook!! Excellent carne asada and carnitas. Salsas and hot sauces very tasty and the fajitas, shrimp cocktail and molcajete served to next table looked and smelled sensational!! I think we've found "our" restaurant.<//review>< pics>

< Review>
I have to agree the food has been amazing before, but the consistency of the meal and customer service leave something to be desired!! My family orders the same exact meals 99.9% of the time, but the same meal (which should taste the same EVERY time) has been changing every time we order it. My burrito was covered in the most delicious sauce the 1st time, the 2nd i couldnt even eat it the sauce was so spicy and the third time it had ingredients in it that shouldnt have been in it. My son likes just chicken and cheese on his nachos, we got a box of chips with no chicken and cheese. Most importantly the customer service is horrendous, call in to mention a mistake and they'll either place blame on the way you ordered it, or argue "the sauce is made the same way and we only have one red sauce, so no sauce then?" WoW!!!< /Review>

<Text>So my first experience there was phenomenal. I was raving about this place to all of my friends and family. BUT I went back a handful of times after that and MAN! They are extremely inconsistent, if you fancy a game of russian roulette but the version on whether or not you're going to have a good meal. Then this is the place for you. My boyfriend and I went there and he ordered the shrimp cooked with lime juice and the waitress delivered it to our table. The shrimp was gray and our waitress tried to tell us that we were wrong and the shrimp was fully cooked. For all you people who dont eat seafood, shrimp turns pink when fully cooked. She did not know what she was talking about whatsoever. The only think I will say was consistent was their horchata. But this isn't a Horchata Cafe it's a restaurant. I will not be returning to this establishment to waste any more of my money.< /Text>< Response>

Great food and friendly service. Staff will tell you service time may be a little longer due to no one applying for work. So if you're in need of a job, give them a shot!< /text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I've tried the shrimp cocktel and octopus cocktel and very rich shrimp. I also liked the shrimp that are stuffed and wrapped in bacon ... I forgot the name.

(Translated by Google) The ceviche has gone down a lot of quality, I don't know if they changed cook, the pieces of tomato and cucumber are very large, it shows that it is more quantity but I would prefer less quantity but quality.

(Original)
El ceviche ah bajado mucho de calidad, no se si cambiaron cocinero, los pedazos de jitomate y pepino estan muy grandes, se nota que es mas cantidad pero preferiria menos cantidad pero calidad.<//review>

<Text>Has everything you need. However, my wife and I tried to adopt two kittens while there but because of COVID, you have to email this specific email they give you to set up an appointment. Unfortunately, when I did email the person, I got no response and still don't. It's ok though because we found other cats to adopt somewhere else.<//Text>< Name>

I've taken my dog to doggy day camp. This place is so cool. They have a schedule hour by hour on what they do with the dogs. They have snack time, then ice cream time they even sit down to read to the dogs. You gotta check them out.< /Text>

This pets mart has such a great variety of food. My dog discovered Nulo brand food and she loves it so of course now my cats do too. This location is easy to get to from the freeway and get back to the freeway from. The employees are always nice and chat with us for a second when we go in.</text>

They took care of me on several occasions in regards to a price match and price discrepancies over the years. More recently I was watching them handle an unruly customer and they handled it professionally. I've never had any issues with the team there, they're always present and willing to help.</Text>

Took my dog for her first Covid grooming and the process was pretty smooth and easy. I'll be sure to bring back my dog and refer others to my dog's groomer as well. I'm happy with the customer service and communication given all around.</Text>

<text>My dog Jack looked great afterward, BUT, the other dogs (2 of them) looked terrified on the grooming tables. The one  male groomer there had the collar so high on this dog's neck and attached to the pole the front legs of the dog were up in the air 😕 I mentioned  this to the manager but nothing was done....< /text>< Pictures>

It took a while to get help while searching through the isles for worm medications, but eventually I waited in line to ask the cashier where I could find the med. Luckily it was locked up behind the counter near the cashier, she was friendly and gave instructions on how to administer the med to my kitten.< /review>

Normally my trips there are nice and helped out with a friendly smile. Today's visit was different,  I am disabled and had asked the clerk if she could get someone to trade the three cans that I picked up by mistake, she was more than happy to call back and have someone do this, the person  that came up with the cans looked at me and says "they were right there on the shelf you know" then asked if I wanted the empty box. She was very rude and have no intention on ever asking for help at this pet smart again.< /Review>

Manager was nice and corrected the cashier initially helping us. She suffered from some serious short term memory loss. Tried to charge me for what I had already paid for 10 minutes before. Don't shop when manager not present.  That cashier is a serious liability< /Review>

One of the managers was also very helpful when helping us find the right toys - I think her name was Lisa (a young blonde girl).<//review>< Rate>

We have started going to PetSmart over the other big brand place who recently stopped carrying our brand of cat food. PetSmart has a lot of brands, shelves are well stocked, store is neat, personnel is friendly. Only 4 stars because there is no location close to my house.< /review>

I always have to wait around a long time just to get crickets for my lizard. The employees look like they are miserable working there, don't bother asking for help or it seems like you are bothering the employees. I rather go to the Vista PetSmart where employees care about the customer.</Review>

I went here to get supplies for my new puppy, and i was very happy with the customer service. Braught my dog and everyone was very friendly to her. Lisa is the best! She helped me get a crate mat the store was out of, and got me the same price and had it held for me at the vista store. Thanks very much Lisa rockstar level service you have earned a grateful customer for life. Would highly recommended this store.< /Text>

We have been coming to pet smart for our Maltese, Bacchus, to get groomed since he was a little puppy. Our regular groomer is Jen. She is a delight. And he always comes out looking spiffy.
Great selection of pet products. They also have a vet and a pet hotel on location.< /Text>

She helped me get a crate mat the store was out of, and got me the same price and had it held for me at the vista store. Thanks very much Lisa rockstar level service you have earned a grateful customer for life. Would highly recommended this store.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<review>I've been going to this Petsmart since my cat was prescribed c/d pet food. Went in yesterday only to find out that with Banfield no longer being in there, they are no longer going to carry prescription foods. Employee we talked to suggested we order it online, which wouldn't work with the time frame needed. (And it's prescription so I don't know if that would have worked period...)

We ended up having to drive all the way to Oceanside to find a store that sold it.< /review>< user_id>

Jennifer grooms my dogs.  She is so sweet to them, they love her.   She is very patient with them.  My older Schnauzer is 13 and can get tired, so Jennifer will let her rest while she works on my other dog.   I feel comfortable leaving my dogs there and feel they are being treated well.   She always goes over everything she has done during the groom.
Also I am pleased with the new rewards program, I got an extra $10 off the cost of the groom.</text>

<text>Had a great experience here every visit since the day we got out pup. They always remember and love to see her, and are helpful when they know I'm tight on funds. You find something for any budget! They are always thoughtful enough to ASK before giving my pup treats (I'm picky about her diet). Make sure to sign up for the MyTreats program! You can save a lot!<//text>< pics>

Just had my pride handed to me by the cashier who disapproved of how I stack my cans. Apparently ringing them up separately takes too long. But the lady behind me is her favorite because she had hers in perfect, separated order. Thank you for embarrassing me and making me feel just a little more crappy today.  Vista is a bit more of a drive but no one ever lectures me on my inefficiency.</review>

< Review>
Man in the fish area won’t sell you fish unless he approves of it. Meaning if he likes the type of fish or not. Petco only asks size tank. They never ask if my tank is set up or tell you that you have to wait 72 hours before putting a fish in there. I only wanted 3 tetras and this guy would only sell be Mollies because he said they would last longer. I was so mad because it’s my only day off and this guy wanted me to come 3 days later to buy them. PetSmart won’t be selling with this guy handling the fish section.</Review>

Mia just had her first day at doggie daycare...... she was happy and not traumatized when I went to get her 4 hrs later...... as a first timer I was a bit nervous,  but staff looked after her and after a few minutes Mia was happy and running around with other dogs......I appreciate that they keep small and large dogs separated in two different play yards.....
I will b boarding Mia there soon.< /text>

<date>1552197105626</date><Review>Man in the fish area won’t sell you fish unless he approves of it. Meaning if he likes the type of fish or not. Petco only asks size tank. They never ask if my tank is set up or tell you that you have to wait 72 hours before putting a fish in there. I only wanted 3 tetras and this guy would only sell be Mollies because he said they would last longer. I was so mad because it’s my only day off and this guy wanted me to come 3 days later to buy them. PetSmart won’t be selling with this guy handling the fish section.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>I drove from the vista petsmart because this location said they had the last dog costume. I rushed because they were about to close, this location didnt bother to look at the costume before I drove! Apparently wires were ripped from the costume. All they said sorry & not offer a 10%-20% for the drive...<//text></record></dataset><record>

This store is great! They are always ready to help you find just what you need, and they even match lower prices on Chewy and their website. It's a smaller store but very clean and friendly, and always have what you need.< /review>

👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼I took my dog for the first and last time to their location in Escondido Blvd👎🏼  but unfortunately they did the worst  job ever , they told me they will clean the ears but👎🏼 they didn't touch the ears at all  worst than all after I took my dog home 👎🏼he started scratching himself to death I thought he was allergic to something but after I spent a few  hundreds at the vet for the tests  they told me that  the person at pet smart who washed the dog  she  didn't  rinse him enough so the soap washes off of  the poor dog 👎🏼so he was carrying detergent on his skin for days after he got washed and that's what caused the itchiness then I called and talked to the supervisor at pet smart👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼 she was the worst and worst   than all,she said oh I don't know and she didn't even say SORRY at least then she said bye.
What a customer service. 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
I don't recommend going there for the grooming.</review>

Went to banfield inside to update all the dogs shots. They did and said all was good now.  Turned out they only gave her the rabies shot and when I pointed this out they now wanted to give her the other shots with another  $54 office visit charge on top.  I complained so they dropped it to $42.  Not going back,and cancelled my plans to use their pet hotel.<//Review>

We go here for dog grooming. Groomers truly seem to love their jobs, and are very kind to animals, We've never had a bad haircut!</Review>

Shopped on a Sunday for my first visit. Only one register was open, so bit of a wait.  Used a grocery type cart since I was getting 20 lb bags of dog food.  The asiles were very narrow, no room for two carts to pass imho. If you bring your pet, cashier will offer a pet treat. Cannot believe how expensive dog food and treats are.</review>

Today went in and there was actually someone working the dept but never offered to help, didnt even acknowledge my presence. I walked out, no sale.

I went to the store to return a bag of dog food that had worms in it and when I talked to an employee she was very rude and told me that it's obvious I am going to find worms in my food if I am purchasing cheap dog food. I thought that was very inappropriate to say to a customer and all I wanted to do is exchanged it and when I told her that she said yeah go change it and she was mumbling stuff to herself about it. That store is very rude and that wasn't my first that an employee was rude<//text>

Friendly staff and decent prices when products are on sale.

The crickets are consistent sizes but smell bad sometimes. When you buy large, you typically get large crickets. At Petco this rarely the case.</Review>

Aug 26 2018 at about 6pm i went here to get some dewormers for my dog. They had them put up i guess to prevent theft. When i went to the cashier, didnt get her name, she was super freindly and tried so hard to get her managers attention. The manager was helping another customer at the time so not a big deal i had to wait. Personally delt with some horrible customer service lately but this cashier and her manager were very helpful and freindly. Not leaving this to get more people to shop here. Im leaving this so hopefully petsmart corporate sees it and reconize these two young ladies for a job well done. Im usually a pain as a customer because i have high expectations for customer service and not very often do i leave a store happier than when i walked in like i did today. Petmart corporate, give these two ladies the kudos they deserve. Good customer service is scarce these days so i would recommend retaining them as employees for as long as possible.< /Text>

I will actively avoid this location from now on. The only reason I need to go here is for prescription cat food, and I will try to find it somewhere else. I've visited multiple times, and the cashier is somewhere between rude and inconvenienced. I've watched an inexperienced dog trainer teaching new dog owners they need to yell at the top of their lungs at their dog, inside the store. It's frequently understocked, and there are usually several pet messes that need to be cleaned up.< /Text>

I brought my golden retriever to be shaving,  after 3 hours they called me and said they had not been able to cut his hair because the dog did not want to get up.
When I picked up him was still wet. Stay away for this place. The people that work here are young and do not have any experience</Review>
