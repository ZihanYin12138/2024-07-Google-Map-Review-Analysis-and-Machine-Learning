<Review>Fantastic service! Brandi, helped me out and made the whole experiance hassle free and set up my appointment to change my brakes and tires at a convenient time for me. The time it took to check in was fast. I recommend them to everyone I know. Definitely call in and make an appointment with them, and plan out your services, if you don't want to wait there just ask a friend or family member for a ride and wait for them to call you back.< /Review><Name>Carlos Zinzun<//Name>< UserId.>

< Review>
Came in for a flat and a noise coming from the front end on my car. They fixed the flat and diagnosed that my suspension was the issue. I agreed to the repairs (which were fairly priced) and no more noise! They even got it all done same day. Car drives like new with almost 300k miles on it! Will be coming back and referring friends. Thank again Just Tires</Review>

<Review>Clean and fast. Slightly priced higher than most for oil changes, but the service is worth it. They check your fluids and other items for free and rotate tires for free with your oil change< /Review>< rate>

I saw a nail in my tire and stopped by. Spoke to the woman up front who went out and check to see if it was leaking. Turns out it was a tiny nail and never went thru so no leaks. She was honest and quick! Even offered to check my tire pressure for free since I haven’t done it in a while. Will be a back for tire stuff in the future!</review>

I had stopped by the shop to get some work done to my vehicle and I was so pleased with the way I was taken care of from the moment I walked in. Brandi was the one who helped me purchase the right tires for my car and informed me so well it really helped me feel at ease. Definitely will be returning for my car future car needs!</text>

Jason and his team were very friendly. Jason was very informative and easy to talk to.  I was impressed with his knowledge and willing to take care of his customers vs the sale. I thought I was special, but quickly notice while waiting, all customers where giving the same red carpet  treatment.

Nice job Jason Wheat!!!

Nice job Barndi Nolasco and supporting staff.

I will be reffering my family and friends to your excellent shop.

Cheers

These guys are awesome. It was 6:30 pm driving through town when I heard the sound of a screw stuck in my tire. Trying to be proactive, I was now trying to get my tire patched when all the shops around town were close to closing. After being turned away at Pep Boys, the guys here at Just Tires had me fixed up and rolling again in twenty minutes. Thanks you, saved me.< /Text>

<text>Excellent service and very friendly staff. Clay was extremely helpful and courteous. He even offered a complimentary air conditioning and heating vent service for free for being his first customer of the day. Just Tires is going to be my go to place for all of my automotive maintenance from now on. I highly recommend this business.<//text>< pictures>

Needed a new tire due to picking up some metal that I never saw, heard, or felt. Tire was 3 months old...uggg! I left my car overnight. I had $65 cash in the center console.  Kudos to their honesty. I usually take my cash out when I leave my car at a service shop. Forgot. Great job on my new tire! Very friendly.  Got an alignment as well. Was referred by a close friend. Thank you Just Tire Orange!</review>

Pros:
1. Friendly however bit lazy staff. They take their own  time to attend and to service. But the end quality of work is good so you would be satisfied after waiting.
2. They have big waiting area where you can enjoy the outside view.
3. Average clean restroom.< /text>

I don’t trust this place anymore. I had been using them since 2005 and always had friendly reliable service.
The new management alway gives you worst case Scenario of what might be wrong or up sell you on services. Just dropped off my car for front wheel alignment for which I paid
for a 3 yr. alignment package.
Mgnt. is already projecting something might be wrong. I miss the previous manager. I’m going elsewhere<//review>

This location takes care of its customers. They are friendly, knowledgeable, and fast (make an appointment!). They don't push maintenance like other shops and the guys in the back are likewise beyond friendly whenever I need a little air in my tires. This location is the definitely best in OC.

Update 2021. After having some communication issues with another Just Tires location (they weren't honoring my alignment warranty), the owner/manager of both locations took care of the problem right away with a simple phone call. Despite a little hiccup, the customer service here is impeccable and I wouldn't trust any other shop with my hotrod.<//review>

Seeing as how tires are one of the most important pieces of a car (without them you're SOL,) it's understandable that the name- brand quality Just Tires offers will be a little high in the price range. However, once you buy the tires rotations are free for the life of the tires. They offer package deals and are willing to accommodate budgets as best as they can. Also I got my struts repaired for free, as a courtesy after having to buy tires (my struts were leaky.) I didn't realize how bad my tires were until I drove away in the new ones. My car drives so much smoother now and I'm getting better gas mileage. Shout-out to Clay for being awesome and willing to work with my budget, and a big praise for the mechanics that worked on my car. Y'all are great.<//Text>< pictures>

I'm an 81-year-old woman who appreciated very much the fact that they did not take  advantage of the fact that I don't know anything about tires . I thought I needed for new tires and they said no I only needed two. The price was extremely fair. I was referred to them by my daughter who has used them for years . I didn't realize they do all kinds of other services which I definitely am going to take it vantage of .< /review>

There is little integrity in this tire shop.  Ever since we had them put on a new set of expensive tires, one of the wheels made a significant noise.  So I took it back to them and they said I was imagining it and sent me away. Using my other mechanic, I validated the noise existed and he recommended I take it back for warranty replacement because of a visible defect.  When I returned to Just Tires the lies and poor service started right away.  Their version of the story changed, the noise existed this time even though they had not even looked at my car again.  But they didn't want to waste anymore time helping me because it would cost them money using an outlandish scenario to prove his point where somehow he loses money on two tires.  Maybe it did cost them in the end, maybe the problem wasn't the tire and it was just a strange coincidence, but I am never going back there because I felt the unwillingness to help my solve my problem was compounded by making me feel like a second class customer.  My trust was broken.  I can't help but think they just put the old defected tire back on.<//review>

<Text>This is the hardest thing to do since prior to the new management this has been the place we have taken all 6 of our cars into. The new manager CLAY not only was rude but unhelpful and only tried to upsell a credit card to us to save 10% on our brakes. They never honor our original brake job 2 year warranty because we were 6 days over the 2 year warranty timeframe, however we were 7000 miles under the 24,000 mile  warrenty. We were willing to pay for the new calibers but not the replacement of the brakes. If Junior or Tony we’re still there they would not only give us the best customer service but they would have honor a 10 plus year customer relationship. They have not only tarnished there reputation but have created a problem which shows the lack of skill sets needed to manage an establishment such as Just Tires! If I could give them 0 stars I would, for any future customers going in be aware that Clay will not only be rude to you but also talk down to you to prove his dominance.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80dcd9feb3ffc449:0x54ee133a5a9da767< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I worked for Goodyear in a previous life and have owned a car dealership for over 10 years. This location has either recently switched Management or simply had a change in ethics. I called in the morning with make of our minivan, model and tire sizes I needed, I spoke with Tony who told me he had 8 of the tires I needed and quoted me $109.00 each "installed", so I gave my Wife the green light to head down there because we had an upcoming road trip, we've used this Just Tires for years with success. Once she arrived the price on the tires doubled to over $200 per tire, I told her, "just leave" and she spoke with Tony while I held on the phone, suddenly, magically the tires were down to $109.00 again. How much profit margin do they have? Later my Wife texted me about an alignment and an oil change, looking at about $540.00 plus tax so I texted her "OK". Then once the car was done there were all these "extras" for valve stems, wheel balance, tire pressure sensors, I spoke with Tony and said, "What happened to the 'installed' price I was told this morning?", he went on to lament how "Goodyear sets the prices" and he has no control over all that. Then the more I spoke to him, and the more my Wife spoke he kept changing the prices. Suddenly the tires were down to $94.99 to absorb some of the balancing and other costs. So he has control or he doesn't have control? I mean which is it?

In the end everything was very shady and we had to confront, kick and scream to get close to what we were originally told. There used to be an employee there named Noel, (not sure I spelled his name right I just remember the name) and he was a much more straight forward person, what he said was what happened and that's why we went back so often. I'll have to see if he is still there and deal with him, if he's at another location and go there, or just find a new place for tires, there are plenty on Tustin. We personally own 8 cars total, plus the inventory that passes through my Dealership that occasionally need tires, brakes, or other work done. I'm sure we can do better than this experience.</review>< Pics>

<text>Brought my car in for an alignment. I told them there was a shaking in my steering wheel and they said they could fix that by aligning the front tires. Sounded great, and the price was reasonable.

I come back to get my car and I drove it a block or so back to my house.

The next day, everything went to hell. I get on the freeway and my steering wheel is still shaking. Then, suddenly, something falls off the bottom of my car, the stick shift lodges itself into the side of the passenger's seat, and I can't shift into fifth. Then I notice that my steering is acting funny. My car starts changing lanes on its own. I can't turn left.

Now, to me, it's more than just a coincidence that this happened immediately after I took my car to a garage. On top of it all, my car wasn't even aligned. Nothing changed other than the balance in my checking account.

All I wanted was a refund, seeing as they clearly didn't fix anything in my car, but my car is now unsafe to drive thanks to them, and they said they can't do anything without looking at it first. I do not want them touching my car again.

They obviously destroyed my car, yet they don't even have the decency to refund me for the work they didn't even do. Don't go here. They're absolutely horrible in every way.</text><date>1354577341385<//date><userid>113030767888384323790</userid>< Name>

The man at the counter told me will be a looong wait, like an hour & half, "or I can come back tomorrow". Really? Takes 10mins to fix a flat. I have a FLAT TIRE! (not my problem you are open til 8pm and ONLY have 2 guys left) He told me it would be about $35 bucks. I have NO CHOICE! While i was sitting, he laughed to another customer "we deal with crabby people all the time, I'm used to it". When someone is stressed, that should be when the GREAT Customer Service kicks in.

I made an appointment online for a basic oiI change and was quoted $45 and 1 hour wait time. Upon arrival I was told that the appointment had "not been processed" but it would be no problem. Noel said he would give me a $5 coupon  so I would only have to pay $39.95. when I went back to get my car, I was told I would have to pay for an additional quart of oil, even though the online price said it was  for all 6 quarts.So i actually paid $5 more than what I was quoted online. On top of it all... I waited 2 hours for an oil change that said would take one hour. It was supposed to come with a complimentary alignment check, but after 2 hours it was still not done and i opted not to wait any longer. They said I could come back in for a free alignment check and had to chuckle because I will NOT go back to this DIS-organization<//text>

How you doing yelpers, I wanted to send in some feed back on my experience with my departing from the Amtrack. First off it was a pleasure riding the 2112 Amtrack witch they said it was 7667, but thats not for me to understand I'm leave that for someone else that could make since of it. But my friend Scott was very kind and help me out to all my needs. Also the Gentleman in the food Cart as well. I had the pleasure of meeting Leam and his mom on the train 🚆 and that always a great thing to be able to meet friends and there love ones hut over all it was a pleasure riding with you again see you next ti.e Essing< /Review>

<Review>Love this station. It is classically one of the best Amtrak stations in the country absolutely beautiful old California style architecture. Very safe location monitoring is well done.< /Review>< user_name>

My son and I were there this morning to get his Greyhound bus ticket and the ticket agent was very nice and polite and respectful and helpful. The customer service is very good and the train station was very nice and clean.< /text>

<Text>I just like waiting for a train here. The station architecture and the aesthetics of it all just makes me feel at ease for some reason. This station is an ideal location for the opening or end credits of a romantic comedy or drama. If you're ever passing by, don't hesitate to park your car and catch the train towards downtown LA or San Diego. You'll enjoy waiting here, at least I know I do.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Trains from into union station are often late here. There is a repetitive announcement on an intercom to let you know every 5 minutes. That's  great but the sometimes muffled and unclear. Also, tapping on google mas gives you a schedule right away which is nice so you dont have to download the app, but it's not usually up to date with delays. The lobby smells like the 1960's bars of asbestos and cigarettes<//Text>

<text>I got off AmTrak Pacific Surfliner and approached the information window. First, I spoke to a man who I had to tell to speak into the mic. He didn’t know the answer to my questions.A woman took over who also didn’t speak into the mic. I said, “Please speak i the mic. I can’t hear you.” She turned around, walking away with her back to me and LITERALLY threw her hands in the air. Wow!</text>< pictures>

In general, I love taking the train. The food car, the scenery, and the slowed down pace you experience. However, I recommend avoiding any segments of travel by Amtrak buses. I was a bit leery of it, but the agent on the phone said "Oh they are not like greyhound or anything, these are Amtrak buses, very nice." Uh, not really. We left Santa Ana at midnight, or were supposed to. The driver was about 20 minutes late, no big deal I guess, my sister was waiting with my son and I for the train to arrive..and even tho Santa Ana is not the first place I would choose to be around midnite..nothing happened. The problem was after we got on..the bus driver got lost, and there we were, not on a free way or main thoroughfare, but lost, in a "bad" part of Santa Ana. Me and my son..and a few rough looking guys saying they hoped the bus didnt get 'jacked'. The driver announced over the PA system if anyone was familiar with the area and if so could they give him directions.. Fortunately, someone did, and after about 15 -30 minutes, we got back on track. Every segment of our 3 leg trip was late, which I personally do not mind much. However I DO mind being put in danger. When I finally got through to Customer Relations after getting home and spoke with Angela, she said there was no record of the driver getting lost or being late (after about 25 minutes on the phone with her looking through her different "screens'" and explaining that the buses are leased and difficult to get information on. She asked for the bus driver's name, saying they don't even know that.) She actually said the bus arrived early, and there was nothing she could do. I may take the train again, as I have had other good experiences with train only trips, but my recommendation is stay away from the buses. And if anything goes wrong, I would get names and make sure the employees report the problem, be it lateness, getting lost or what have you.< /Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) The terminal is very lonely as priority is given to the car is the only thing that California critics focus a lot on individual car use, on the other hand the terminal is in very good operating condition very clean.

<text>All popular pizza chains operate by the same basic standards. To me, at this point, it really just comes down to mood and taste. The pizza hut app never works for me though but that isn't exactly an issue for me as they have the website version.< /text>< pictures>

☆☆~Was happy when I found out that Pizza Hut works with schools to  encourage kids to work on learning to read, by giving the teachers gift certificates for a personal pan pizza to give the kids who have gone above and beyond as an award!! Was a GREAT incentive for my son and was REALLY encouraging to him....!! :-) THANK YOU PIZZA HUT for helping our kids want to and enjoy learning!!!!!♡♡</Text>

Pizza is great and so are all the employees whom are working at this Pizza Hut. Each certainly goes above and beyond in Customer Service. In all my experiences, I have never been disappointed. The Delivery Drivers always arrive on time and are often early. I'm also about to take advantage of the free pizza deals for ordering often. Thx so much!< /review>

Ramona Pizza Hut delivers to the Estates.
Im very happy about that.
Online orders placed for delivery in the Estates may give you a prompt that reads "There are no stores that deliver to this area" put the Pizza Hut Address for the delivery address. Then call the store to correct the address or they will call you. Thanks Marisa.
Food and service have been fine.
Over several orders we received what we ordered in the time frame indicated for delivery.</Review>

No longer offering my favourite crust (pretzel)  or premium tomato sauce,  and sometimes running out of deep dish crusts takes the Hut Experience down to three stars!<//Review>

<Review>I recommend this establishment the process was smooth and stress free.  Robert and Javier did such an awesome job.  If I decide to buy another vehicle I know where to go and who to ask for.   If you are on the search of a new vehicle I highly recommend Patriot Hyundai of El Monte ask for either Robert or Javier they would take care of you guys.  Thank you guys for the great deal. I am loving my new vehicle.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Let me start this review with I am a happy customer!  My story with trying to get a new vehicle in the age of COVID needless to say has been a struggle.  I live in Victorville and commute every day to LA I needed a vehicle that was reliable and the vehicle I had wasn't cutting it.  I have some credit issues and they are being fixed, however I went to three dealerships in Victorville Nissan, Ford, and Hyundai.  All three of these dealerships ran my credit and none of them of them wanted to get me into a new vehicle. I owed a lot on my old car and the dealerships in Victorville like I said didn't want to make a deal the Nissan dealership was out right rude and the finance manager was very condescending and made it like he was doing me a favor by selling me a car that I didn't like.  The Ford dealership just didn't try and they Hyundai dealership there just gave up.  But THANKS TO PATRIOT HYUNDAI!!!! they were able to make me a deal put me in the car I wanted and I am forever grateful.  Arya did a magnificent job on putting together the deal and I want to also thank Ryan for making it happen.  These guys went above and beyond to make it happen.  I also want to thank Paul in finance for taking the time and walking me through the contract process.  Patriot Hyundai treated me with respect and they were able get a deal done and they are absolutely amazing.< /review>

The service department here is professional and honest. Joey is great and communicates everything you need to know to make the best care decisions for your vehicle. I did not purchase my Hyundai here, but I would consider buying my next one at this dealership.<//text>

Buyer beware! If you are looking at their vehicles online don’t waste your time driving out to this dealership... THEY ARE A TOTAL SCAM! I was looking for a new truck and came across their ad, called the dealership to verify that they still had the vehicle and Brenda confirmed multiple times all the information. It was a complete bait and switch well it’s actually a clear case of false advertisement. The pictures in their ad did not match the car they were selling, the excuse they tried using “our picture guy took pictures of the wrong car”. Clearly this dealership doesn’t understand what constitutes false advertisement because apparently the manager informed us that it happened to another customer earlier and he had to apologize. I questioned him as to if he knew there was an error this large (10,000 price difference) on his website why did he still have the ad up? His response was that it was for another vehicle. So this just shows that they are clearly misleading the consumer. This dealership should not be allowed to operate.<//text>

<GmapID>0x80c2d1e3dc62988d:0x80f84f64d59a5540<//GmapID><Review>If it was an option I'd give this place 100 stars. I went to a handful of dealerships before finding this location and each salesman either didn't take me seriously or respected/ valued my negotiating terms. Then I reached out to Patriot expecting the same experience, however as soon as I spoke to Alex he did everything in his power to provide the best customer service.

No hassle or haggle on vehicle price, he really worked with me to meet my price point and provide the best finance option. Another thing I'd like to add is I live in Salton City (150 miles away from the dealership), but that didn't stop him from making me a Hyundai owner. All communications and paperwork were signed and done in the comfort of my home and Joseph took the time to hand delivered my new Hyundai from El Monte to my home.

The people at this location went above and beyond to provide me the Christmas miracle I prayed for. And I thank them for giving me and my family stable transportation we needed. I definitely plan to go to them in the future for future car purchases regardless of distance.

Thank you Patriot!<//Review><Rating>5<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

<user_name>Joey Benadiba</user_name><Review>I wouldn’t recommend anybody to lease or buy a car here. I leased my car at this dealership, came to purchase my car now that my lease is ending, and was provided a number to buy my car that I was told, included taxes.  After taking some time to think about my decision, I let Brianna know that I would like to buy my car based on the number I was provided.  After speaking with her manager, she then gave me a number that was $2,200 higher than the number I was originally given. I was completely blind sided with this larger number which was explained as “dealership fees.” Brianna was very polite and helpful,   her manager must be the reason for this disaster of a situation.  Working in sales myself, honesty and transparency should always come first and I did not experience either at this dealership.

Don’t visit Patriot Hyundai in El Monte unless you want to be bait and switched, or treated like a number.  I had an absolutely horrible experience.</Review><user>108158831455427851647< /user></record></dataset><record>

Wasted my time and told me I would be qualified for 2.99 interest rate. Then switched it to 7.99. What's worst is that they tried to charge me 5k for vehicle warranty.  Robert said it was the banks requirement to add the warranty in order to get my loan approved by the bank. These shady people are making money off the vehicle and they tried to make another 5k from  the warranty. I didn't ask for any discounts and was putting 5k down payment.  Didn't budge on their price.  Avoid these people.<//Review>

DONT bother coming here if you are looking for a dealership to work with you! They are not willing to work with you here. As a first time car buyer they were making it very difficult for me and on top of that they ran my credit 3 different times and now my credit score is lower! Not once did they mention that to me that it will affect my credit score. I even told them I was a first timer. I guess you live and you learn huh. I don’t recommend this place at all. And to add the cherry on top they’re inventory is very dirty and unorganized. Very different from other car dealerships I have gone to. Thank Goodness for Covina Valley Kia!! They helped me out!!! 😊<//Text>

Buyers beware. Get something in writing before they reel you into the dealership.

Their online prices are very misleading. I drove 2.5 miles for a vehicle only to learn that the dealer added $3k in who knows what!

The sales reps didn’t seem interested in my business- A not very friendly sales person, who never gave me her name until I asked for it,  waddled back and forth with the sales manager, whom I had asked to speak to,because I had spoken to the online customer representative told me to go to them but the sales rep said, that she would work with me instead.

The price was about 28K on a Toyota preowned vehicle- which would be about 35K instead! I can buy a new car at that price!

I would have paid that price until they added all this other stuff, but they didn’t want to negotiate or take me serious, which was too bad, when they have Longo Toyota right around the corner and so many other dealerships.

Be clever, get the details, and don’t waste your time until you have a clear set price with no added fees.

Sheeeesh!< /Text>

I normally do not write negative reviews but in light of the situation and the numerous times I have been ignored and not called back this leaves me no option. I bought a used truck 2 months ago. Everything appeared to be ok until we got home and noticed that the rear inside fender guards were missing. I assumed when the truck received new tires, that they just forgot to put them back on. It took 3 weeks to just get someone to address the issue. Finally due to being sick, which I completely understand, my salesman was able to get the Used car manager to order them from Chevy and that seemed to end my issues. Well my husband works everyday as a business owner, he does not have time to drive to El Monte but went on a Sunday not knowing that there wasn't another manager there with keys to get us the parts. He told my husband they would mail them to us. 3 more weeks and 4 phone calls later I still do not have the parts and no one will return my calls even when I tell them my experience with past calls. I have been in Customer Service for 25 + years and this is bad customer service after buying a $35000.00 truck</review>

The prices they post on their website are not honored. They added $3000 to the pre tax price of the car once I showed up to look at it. Ask for the out the door price before you get there or be prepared to be surprised.

Ari was the salesman I dealt with. He made no mention of the $3000 protection package they require you to purchase with their vehicles until I was ready to fill out the paperwork and buy it. Huge waste of my time.<//Text>

Never trust this dealer. They replaced my battery that is certified by AAA toll truck driver as "Good" (No need to replace!). The agreement was $320 including all the fees and tax and it is a "Hybrid" --- according to the Adviser Garrek. My car is NOT a hybrid and battery is $99 cheap one that does not have warranty. When we came to pick up the car, it became $435. Again, never trust this dealer and the Adviser Garrek.< /Review>

<review>Bought a car Nov 2020. The purchase process was fine, but the dealership messed up my address and they have been AWOL ever since. Paperwork not arriving. Extra key fob missing. Who knows what's going on with the registration. I'm getting no response from Alex, who sold me the car. Hoping that this review gets someone's attention.

<text>I inquired about a Ram 1500 advertised online.  Jocelyn Quintero informed me it was available.  The dealer website sent me 2 emails that a 6pm appointment was set for the next day.  Jocelyn told me to disregard them and come in anytime the next day.  I began driving there,  100 miles round-trip,  when I decided to verify the 1500 would be available.  I called and was placed on hold because the salesmen couldn't confirm its availability.  He had to call me back.  When he did I was told it wasn't ready. That it was "dirty and in pretty rough shape". That it needed a seat replaced. Why would Patriot advertise a vehicle that's not ready to sell?? Very unprofessional. Luckily I called or I would have wasted two and a half hours on the freeway.</text>< GmapID>

Our "sales man" Jose was not interested in selling a car today. Maybe it was cuz both my son and I looked not as people with money looked I guess. Both of us had just gotten off work. My son is a mechanic so obviously he was greasy looking.  But no, José was not intersted in dealing with US. Thats ok, we just took our business else where. We got the exact same car elsewhere for ALOT less. Thank you José for not helping us<//Review>

<review>On my first visit to Patriot Hyundai I met Giovanni (manager – Gio) and Tommy (salesman) who accompanied me on a test drive (Kona SEL). I left the dealership and continued to communicate with Giovanni.  (I would be back on Labor Day weekend).   Gio never responded to my last text.  I questioned this on my 2nd visit.  All he could say was that he was extremely busy to call (?).  I was introduced to Reza; a salesman with professionalism.  He introduced me to the Kona Ltd., and I fell in love.  During my talks with finance, I was provided with my total mileage a year which was lower than originally stated. I refused and paperwork was withdrawn and reissued after talks.  I asked for the car to be delivered and Reza volunteered to drive my new car home.  Giovanni asked if I would drive Reza back, due to the fact that they did not have a service at that time to pick him up. (?)  To avoid returning, I drove Reza back to the dealership (it was my pleasure).   My two Stars reflect my experience.  I have yet to go through my paperwork and provide you with an update.</review>< user>

<Text>This review is solely on my experience on buying a used Jeep.
First off, I was lied about the Carfax. Salesman stated that the car was still under manufacture warranty because it had less than 20 miles. I had later found out that the warranty was VOIDED because the Jeep came from Canada. Never did he mention the JEEP was from CANADA

Finance manager (BIG OVERWEIGHT WHITE GUY)  convinced me to buy the extended warranty and I later cancelled and then he harassed me about it and said  " I hope your Jeep doesn't break down". Basically guilt tripped me because he lost his commission.

Months passed by to the point that the paper plates that were given to us were about to expired. It wasn't till we got a phone call saying that the JEEP was not SMOGED. How do you sell a car that has not been smoged???

Now back to the extended warranty, the petty over weight finance manager mentioned that it was going to take WEEKS for my refunded. I WAITED 5 MONTHS. it wasn't  until i was blowing them up and they confirmed that they had FORGOTTEN ABOUT MY REFUND.

This place is a joke. Everyone here is so unprofessional.
They will give you the run a round. Like we just spent 36k and this is how you treat your customers??? I will be filling a complaint to the DMV.

NEVER COME HERE PLEASE, KNOW YOUR WORTH!!!!</Text>< Pics>

The worse dealership ever. In 2018 I bought my car.
In November 2019 I was involved in a car accident that wasn’t my fault. I dropped my car at Patriot Hyundai for repair and the person in charge was Valerie Machado. Without mu consent Patriot Hyundai sent my car to a third party body shop to do the job that suppose to be done by them. After a month and a half my car couldn’t be released because they said they didn’t receive the payment from the insurance company, but they didn’t receive because the checks were sent directly to the body shop that did the repairs.
On Jan 7, 2020 I finally got my car from Patriot Hyundai, and one more headache. My car had a really poor repair. So after my complain with Patriot Hyundai I was informed that my car was repaired by a third party body shop. And then the mess started. Patriot Hyundai start blaming the body shop, insurance company etc. they did everything to get out of the scene as I never dropped my car over there. Because of Hyundai Patriot did not release my car I had to pay $800 for rental car that they said they wouldn’t pay. During Jan, Feb, March and April 2020 I went to them to try solve the situation. But they kept saying that they are not responsible for a anything since my car was repaired by another body shop and they don’t have any records of my car been there even proving with documentation provided by them that I dropped my car over there and picked it up over there. They even lied to BAR saying that my car was held because I didn’t want to pay $70 for the maintenance required by me when I dropped my car for repairs. After going there several times the answer was always the same. I spoke with Ronnie the manager that said he could not do anything because the person in charge for my car repair at the dealership is no longer working for them. Again, they did everything to not help me to solve the situation and lied badly to keep in this way. After 7-8 months in this mess I’m still trying to solve with them.
I’d never ever recommend this dealership to anybody for any reason.< /text>

<Review>I took my 2010 Hyundai Elantara in for a check up in July. The car needed new spark plugs and head gasket. Joey took care of everything. He was polite and professional. The car has been running great, no problems. I would refer any Hyundai owner to take their car to Patriot Hyundai for servicing.</Review></record>

It depends on the person your explaining the situation, & how you present yourself. For me, was different.  I explain the situation as much detail as I can and he explain it to me what was the problem. I wrote it down since I go to school to learn this. Took about 3, almost 4 hours but hopefully took there time and there told what was the problem. Good place<//review>

I am grateful this local Hyundai dealership is around my neighborhood first of all.  I came in to this dealership with some knowledge about my car problem.  Later found out from their diagnosis that a new transmission needed to be done.  I have come to conclusion that this is true because I learned from my diagnostic scanner tool about the same symptoms and diagnosis.  Hyundai staff in this dealer is very helpful and reliable.  My personal mechanic were charging me extra 75% more of the transmission price but Hyundai gave me big discount as opposite.  My car is driving like new right now and couldn’t be more pleased.  I’m thankful for Hyundai personal financial assistance also to my situation and I look forward to return for regular maintenance.  Hyundai patriot is my go to service spot for my ionic from now on.  I appreciate their expertise in a high level and decided not to bring my car anymore to independent shops.<//Review>

<text>Absolutely the Worst service Ive ever experienced.

I had been looking for my specific vehicle for Weeks and I was delighted to see its availability at Patriot Hyundai of El Monte. They assured me, when I called ahead the first week of June, that the vehicle would be reserved for me later in that day to purchase. Giving me the impression it was drive-off-the-lot-ready. I called a head because I live nearly 2 hours away from their location....

I would give these people a zero, but I had to press a star to rate them. This is the worst car dealership ever. First, I had everything locked on with USAA to complete the financing the day of. The finance manager said he will take care of it first thing the next day. A month later, I noticed my previous car wasn't paid off! I called and they claimed it was due to the pandemic. A month later I called again to see if they were going to pay my previous car off, they hung the phone up. So I called again and asked for a manager, they hung up again. I finally got through after the 6th call. They some how lost my contract. So I've been driving around in their truck for 2 months without it being tracked nor my car being paid off. I finally had to drive down there for the 2nd time, 3 hours away. When I got there, I literally had to do their job by submitting all the paperwork to USAA, because they failed to locate my contract (I had to bring my own).
Here it is 3 months later, and I still do not have my license plate. It is due to expire and I called and they claimed it was because the pandemic. They are extremely unprofessional and I cannot believe another agency hasn't shut them down. I called true car to complain and hopefully, this makes a difference. Stay away from this dealership, incompetent staff period.</Review>

After 3 years of leasing a car from them, now trying to return the car, and they say they don’t have any available appointments until next month to return the car. The manager straight up told me “it’s your problem that we don’t have a spot for your car now and you have to pay your monthly bills until we have a spot available to take your car”. How ridiculous is that? Friends had warned me about their poor customer service. This was definitely my last Hundai.< /review>< pictures>

<resp>None</resp><Text>Yesterday, I purchased a 2018 Wrangler Jeep Sahara from Patriot Hyundai of El Monte. At 64, I have purchased many vehicles over the years. This was BY FAR the most enjoyable buying experience I have ever had. My sales person was Will. He didn't push me or try to up sell me. He was professional, kind, attentive and extremely personable. If you go there ask for Will. You won't be disappointed. Alex was the finance guy and the same can be said for him. He too did not try to up-sell me but he did give me food for thought so I could make informed intelligent decisions. He is to be commended for changing my mind about buying an extended warranty. I am very grateful that I did. I cannot complete this review without mentioning the dealership owner. His name is Sam. When I met him, I had no idea he owned the dealership. He mingled among his employees as if he were one of them. No pretense or ego. Just an extraordinarily kind and personable gentlemen. If you ever get the opportunity to meet this man talk with him. He has a fascinating background. I am leaving out a few things here. The reason is I don't want anyone to demand the kind of service I experienced. But when I say Will, Sam and Alex went out of their way to make my buying experience comfortable ... I mean WAY above and beyond (especially Will). If you are in the market for a new or used vehicle, go here first!!< /Text><username>Bill Gaines<//username><time>1591835786579</time>< user_id>

Came for a vehicle checkup. They thankfully replaced this part on my steering wheel that was making clicking noises. They told me I needed to get rear brakes changes, driver belt changed, brake fluid, transmission fluid, coolant and more adding up to a $1000+. I told them not to do anything and picked up my car (they didn’t wash it). I got home and checked on my rear brakes, driver belt, brake fluid. Everything was fine. I added more coolant myself. CHECK EVERYTHING THEY SAY. You could save $$$$< /review>

Excellent service, super professional, fair price, really interested in  meeting customers' expectations and solving any eventual problem.
Oscar, in particular, is very friendly and available for any clarification and support, even after the office hours...remarkable.
My car had an engine failure, everything solved with a complete replacement in few weeks, covered by warranty and with a beautiful rented car offered in the meanwhile.
Simply excellent. Definetely 5 stars< /Text>

<review>My 2019 Sonata Hybrid's engine light came on so I made a 8:30am appointment the previous day and Joey from the Service Dept assisted me. He diagnosed the issue by 10am and because the work was going to take a while he provided me a Lyft home. The car's warranty covered the cost and my car was ready before 3:30pm. I appreciated Joey for his prompt and friendly customer service, especially since it was my first time there.< /review><user_id>106170268251643692215<//user_id>< pics>

If I could give this dealer zero stars, I most definitely would. About a week ago, my boyfriend insisted on looking at this 2017 Ram truck listed for almost $23,000 online and so we made an appointment to check it out. When we sat down with Manny to talk numbers, he told us there were new tires installed and a lift kit added on the truck 2 days prior to us going to see it so it was going to be an extra $3,500. Well, there was NO lift kit added. The managers kept lying to us for over 2 hours saying there was a lift kit. They told us “We promise we won’t lie to you again.” Why lie to a customer in the first place? They couldn’t even show proof that ANY of this was installed because the “business office was closed”. If you can’t show proof that something was installed on a vehicle when you are adding an extra cost when the price online says otherwise, why open on the weekends at all? Anyway, we are all so thankful this truck was sold before my boyfriend even put money down on this truck. We are disappointed in the service and DO NOT recommend this dealer.</review>

<Time>1601656069548</Time><Review>1. I wasn't even there at the dealership for 1 hour on Sept 25, 2020 so I don't know where you supposedly spent over 3 hours reviewing a variety of options with me.

2. I knew I didn't qualify for some of the incentives. I was asking Gio to honor the dealer discount on the offer I received.

3. I called a total of 6 times between Sept 28, 2020 and Sept 30, 2020. I came after 6:00 pm and Thomas wasn't even there. When I called asking for the GM and was asked "for what reason", I said a complaint.

4. When did Thomas supposedly call me on his day off? What number did he use to call me? I will provide my phone records to show an incoming call never came. How about you own up to your lack of customer service instead of replying with false statements?

5. I was never told how to email the GM. I was only told that he would give me a call back.

Sept 25, 2020: I came here to check out and test drive a 2020 Ioniq EV Limited with an offer from this dealership through Truecar. I met with Jocelyn, who then introduced me to Thomas, the sales person. Thomas was great. He answered all of my questions regarding the car and understood exactly what I was looking for. When it came time to discuss price, I met with Gio (I think that's how his name is spelled) and explained that due to my situation, we were unable to buy that day but I wanted to get a price down and ready for when I was ready to purchase. He wouldn't give me a concrete answer on whether they would honor the offer through Truecar or not. He told me to go shop around and bring him offers and he'll beat them.

Monday, Sept 28, 2020: While I'm about to test drive at a different dealership, I realized I didn't have my driver's license. I am 99% sure that I left it at Patriot, so I call them and explain that I believe I left my license there. They told me that Thomas had left for the day and to call back the next day.

Tuesday, Sept 29, 2020: I call and ask for Thomas but was directed to Jocelyn. I explained that I believe I left my license there. She acknowledged it and told me that she would have Thomas call me after his meeting. 2-3 hours pass and I received no call, so I called Jocelyn back. She apologized and told me that she would tell Thomas to call me ASAP and that if the license was left on a desk, then they would have called me. 3 more hours pass and no call. I called Jocelyn again and she said that she would have someone go to the car I test drove and look and then Thomas would call me back. By 6:30pm, no one had called me so I drive to the dealership. I met with Gio and explained the situation. He told me that Thomas didn't see my license on any desk and that someone had gone and checked everywhere in the car. I ask for the keys to check it myself. Within 1 second of opening the passenger side door, the license was sticking out between the seat cushion and the backrest. If someone had checked the car, it was 100% easily noticeable.

Wednesday, Sept 30, 2020: I called back to talk to Jocelyn but she wasn't available, so I asked to speak to the General Manager. I was told that he was busy and to leave a name and phone number and he'll call me back. The call never came.

I am writing this review because I am severely disappointed by the lack of customer service to someone who is in the market and was interested in a car on their lot. Thomas was great when I was talking to him about the car, but despite leaving a message to call me back 3 times never did. I don't know the circumstances for this, but someone else should have called back. Secondly, telling a customer that you looked for their license in the car and couldn't find anything only for them to take 1 second to find it as soon as they opened the door does not look good on you. From the customer's point of view, it looks like you didn't even try to look because of how obvious the license was located. If they showed me that lack of customer service when I needed them to look for my driver's license that I was 99% sure I left there, how would their service look like when I had an issue with a car I bought from them?<//Review>< Name>

Most clients want to finish quickly at the dealership, in your case you asked us every question and beyond. We also never refused your pricing, you simply did not qualify given your personal information provided, we are not in control of that. Vehicle\'s pricing change on the regular based on manufacturer\'s rebates that we do not control. We therefore  as explained to you, cannot "lock in" pricing. It\'s so disingenuous of you to state we had a lack of customer service when it wasn\'t that we did not look for your license but rather we told you we would send someone to look and that we were serving other guests at the time. We are sorry you could not respect the time of our other clients and you needed everything right now, for you and nobody else. With COVID19 we take extra steps for clients which means delays in our staff assisting everyone. Your call was 2 hours before your arrival with Thomas on lunch and our other staff assisting 2 different elderly clients to return home after a late vehicle drop off. We are sorry we could not simply drop the other clients to immediately serve you, perhaps under normal circumstances we could. We\'ve further reviewed our recordings and when asked you admit Thomas called you back but you were busy, despite this being his day off! You requested to speak with our GM and were plainly asked "For what reason" but did not wish to provide it, we are not sure the purpose of hiding your information. Regardless Justin,  we understand it\'s tough to understand when you simply don\'t qualify or can\'t get the vehicle of your dreams, but it isn\'t a reason to take it out on us after we did everything we could and more for you when you were irresponsible with your license and over demanding. If you wish to reach our GM as you were told that day you may contact patriot.help@patriotgroup.ca'}</Resp></record></dataset><record>

<text>Our experience at this dealership was outstanding. We contacted Patriot and was cheerfully greeted by Will. We immediately fell in love with our vehicles, I explained to Will our concerns with the current Covid situation and me working in the healthcare I felt the need for extra precautions to be taken while making this transaction happen. Will went over and beyond to meet our needs in making sure all the paperwork was completed and we were able to sign paperwork outside in a timely manner and at the same time respect our current Health Care issues. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Employees like Will will definitely take us back to this dealership.</text>< Date>

<text>My service advisor, Garek Wong, was so great! The first time I went to the dealership with my trunk problem in the late afternoon, he told me it's best that I come back the next day right when they open at 8am so that I didn't have to sit and wait so long. I came back the next morning as instructed and he was there to help check me in. I came in for a trunk that was having issues closing. I also got an oil change and he recommended a brake flush to preserve the vehicle. He told me it was going to take several hours and graciously enough got me a Lyft ride to drop me off and pick me back up. During my car's evaluation, it was discovered there was a problem with the front axle which was luckily still under warranty so they got it fixed.

The financial advisor Paul Jacob's is A HORRIBLE FINANCIAL ADVISOR. Very rude, pushy, and misinformed. MAKE SURE TO DOUBLE CHECK PAPER WORK BECAUSE THEY WILL CHARGE YOU FOR EXTRA FEES YOU MIGHT NOT WANT. He told me he would not sell me the car if I did not want to pay for additional fees for something that was supposed to be optional, but claimed it was not when it REALLY WAS. HORRIBLE FINANCIAL ADVISOR, I WISH I CALLED A LAWYER BEFORE SIGNING.<//review>

{'time': 1599347706513, 'text': "Hi RL, we're surprised to read this as many people often praise Paul for his thoroughness and clear explanation of everything. To add to that, Paul frankly isn't a salesperson as you mentioned he's a financial advisor. Perhaps you misunderstood that due to your credit worthiness the bank wanted to charge you additional fees. The dealership doesn't cover credit-assistance required fees.\n\nWhy don't you reach out to us at patriot.help@patriotgroup.ca and we can then make the whole set of conversations that follow public as we don't have anything to hide.\n\nLet us know, the Team at Patriot."}< /Response>

I purchased my 2016 Hyundai Genesis R spec from here I am very happy with the price and the beautiful car i got. I highly recommend William if you are looking to purchase or lease a car. William will help you get the car that you are looking for with your budget in mind. William is a very informative sales representative. He was very nice and friendly and was not pushy about anything even though I had a lot of questions for him about the car and finances  and he was able to answer everything for me with no problem. I highly recommend this Hyundai dealer!!! Everyone was very nice and made you feel like home.<//review>

After going to multiple dealers, we decided to go to this one. Not only did we get a great deal, we also got great customer service. Will Martinez was by far the kindest salesmen we've encountered and he made the process very easy and enjoyable. Anytime we need a Hyundai, we'll definitely be back to this one</text>

I purchased my Hyundai Elantra in 2015 it a 2016 model. I've been going to service there ever since. Obviously this was prior to Patriot  Hyundai taking over from Win Hyundai , but many times at my visit there is some sort of complication. The new manager Oscar, is excellent at what he does and how he addresses anything with the customers. I also love my service rep Valerie, she's always on top of things and goes above and beyond every visit. However recently I have noticed a drop in morale in the overall service department. I'm not sure what's going on but it is reflecting in the service. I also want to state that is very frustrating that every time I'm told I need a part, it always has to be ordered. That should not be the case foe dealerships. However it is the case all too often at this dealership. I have owned a few other makes and mode outside of Hyundai, and I've never had this type of inconvenience.</Text>

<Text>I went in for an oil change today and found that only 2 out of 6 employees that I saw were wearing face covering, and one of them was wearing it incorrectly with the nose out. Also, there was not a single container of hand sanitizer in sight. When I asked my service tech if they're not required to wear masks, he showed me his mask that was on the desk next to him, and said that he'd taken it off because he had been back in the service area. This is so disrespectful! Why do they think that they are above the county mandate? All of the customers were wearing masks and maintaining the recommended social distance between one another, but the employees apparently don't care about one another or their customers. Shame on you Patriot Hyundai!< /Text><GmapID>0x80c2d1e3dc62988d:0x80f84f64d59a5540<//GmapID></record>

Salespeople at this location put on a extravagant show for the people wanting to buy, but when it comes to a transport driver picking up a vehicle they become late, shallow, rude and inconsiderate. They also like to put you on hold for an hour to ask you again what was it that you needed. I’d say the new ownership needs to address this outstanding issue.</Review>

<review>They had a price on the website for a 2018 jeep Rubicon of $28000 for over 72hrs , drove 1hr to get there and finance Alex to tell me it was a wrong price. Which this means it was a FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!
Said there's nothing they can do .
But thank you for making a long drive .
Any business should honor the price regardless,  dont pump up the price just because you want to make more $$ .
It was not professional at all .< /review>< Pics>

<response>{'time': 1584654306888, 'text': "Hi Crystal, our intention wasn't to make more $$ at all. Unfortunately that week we had an inventory error with our software that caused incorrect prices to be displayed. That Rubicon for $28,000 would have been an over $7000.00 loss to the dealership. We had and have no problem selling our client's vehicles at a fair and reasonable price but we cannot sustain such huge losses and continue to serve our clients. Regardless it was our mistake and we are sorry for the inconvenience."}</response><GmapID>0x80c2d1e3dc62988d:0x80f84f64d59a5540<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Walked in to get some info on new hybrid cars.
Very friendly staff,
Got all my answers on the new full electric Kona.
At $45000 full option the best deal in market.<//Review>

<Text>I had a factory maintenance appointment. Hindsight, I suggest calling your service location ahead of time because when you're making the appointment, Hyundai likes to hide the prices.

Appointment was scheduled for 11:45A, though I wasn't helped until around 12:15P, there wasn't much going on that I could see, but again, that I could see, maybe there was a lot going on in the back. There's chips and water while you wait. Pretty pricey for factory maintenance, so I'd suggest putting money on the side a few weeks in advance, so the hit on your wallet isn't too hard and you're able to afford all the suggested maintenance.

I was helped by Raymond, and he was friendly & informative.

The waiting area has a small children's play area with cartoons playing. My little one loved the foam blocks. The popcorn wasn't working. There's vending machines and free coffee to the side, by the restrooms.

There's fast food restaurants just a block away, in case you have a long wait, like myself. Convenient.

I was pretty bummed that my car didnt get washed or vacuumed. It's on the list for the package. I spent over $200 and didn't get all that I paid for. Raymond said I could come back, but honestly, this was my day off, I had already postponed maintenance because it's tough to find the time to go and have things done. 100% inconvenient. I guess I'll have to pay for one of those express washes & vacuum myself, on top of the hour long wait and +$200 I already spent on my car.

My car is working great though, I will say. No complaints about the work that was done.

In comparison, when I had a Honda, service at all of it's locations was always above 5 stars.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>I had a great experience here at "Patriot Hyundai" in El Monte, Ca. Specially with the help of "Maggie Tellez" who was the greatest sales person who showed me my car options. She was very friendly and was more concerned in helping me find exactly what I wanted versus just trying to make a sale. She showed me in great detail the specifics about each car I looked at and also offered a test drive for them as well. I would definitely recommend her to my family and friends. Thank you so much "Maggie" and thank you "Patriot Hyundai" in El Monte.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<review>Do not waste your time, found a truck online called them with a pre approval from my bank to purchase the vehicle, they told me it was state law that they had to run my credit to verify my identity which was a flat out lie I looked it up it is just a used car salesman scheme!! And the price was different when I called them from what they listed on line total waste of my time!!! They lost a sale that day was ready to spend my money there, but  I went elsewhere and bought a pick up where They treated me right and didn’t try to bend me over!!<//review><Name>Nathan Osborn</Name><UserId.>106250080217222134066<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<review>This was not where I purchased my car, but where I chose to complete my first service because it was closer to my home.  The staff was friendly and the dealership nice.  My only complaint is that I made an appointment, which was not honored.  My appointment was for 8:00 am, I got there at 7:45 and there were four cars it front of me which were taken ahead of me. It was a first come first service.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Review>This place used to be terrible and I always avoided here for servicing my car, but I noticed a new owner took over and now it has a new management, so I decided to give it a try! And I am sooo glad that I did that, cause everything has changed and they are definitely trying to fix the reputation and they really take care of the customer.
Patriot Hyundai is now my go to place to service my cars. My wife and I have two Hyundai cars and we really enjoy the customer service here ever since new management change.
Also, I have to admit another main reason I go here is the coffee! Believe it or not they have this amazing advanced coffee machine that makes absolutely great quality and tasty coffee 👌
It creates great coppucino and latte very professionally.😋
Thank you Patriot!<//Review>< rating>

Came to this place with an appointment. Waited for 20 minutes for someone to acknowledge me just for them to tell me that my vehicle was no longer under warranty, which I already know. I wanted them to take a look and give me a price for repairs, but they didn't look like they wanted to help me. I will never go back to this place again. It doesn't look like they want business.< /Text>

Had an appointment and arrived 20 minutes prior. After seeing I had a maintenance agreement, they said they didn't have time for just an oil charge. They even mentioned they do not make money and believe they took the guy who arrived after me. Doesn't matter that I bought last 2 cars there. Good luck if you have a maintenance agreement.oh, that's after waiting for 15 minutes as they were doing who knows what.</review>

Hyundai El Monte helped my husband  find the car we were looking for and had great customer service! We purchased a 2012 BMW thanks to stefania she did an amazing job getting us in THE CAR HE WANTED and she didn’t try to get HIM into a car just to make a sale. I recommend Stefania to put in work for you. I would definitely go to Stefania and Hyundai of El Monte for great deals.<//review>

FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! When looking at online prices for vehicles advertised on this company's website, please call and verify that the price is correct. We drove out from Temecula to El Monte to possibly purchase a vehicle and once we got there, they hiked up the price 4 grand and said it was a mistake. They didn't offer to pay for the gas we had used and the finance department didn't even have the common courtesy to come out and let us know that it was a mistake. I've personally worked in management for the DCH companies and I can say that this was handled very poorly. I would never recommend this dealership to anyone.< /text>

He became my advocate to ensure l had enough information to make sound decision on my next vehicle. He was friendly, patient and helpful, which allowed me to think through.

After visiting multiple dealerships, we visited patriot Hyundai in El Monte. We already had in mind what we were looking for, Jhojan Garcia has amazing customer service he didn’t try and up sell us to other vehicles like so many other sales people we had encountered. He was very patient with our 2 young kids. Overall it was a great experience, laid back environment. Would definitely send friends or family over to see  Jhojan Garcia</Text>

On 9/25/2920, I went there to buy out my leased vehicle,  they seemed very nice at that time, my buy out price only $15900, they said I have very good credit, and gave me 3 options, 0 down, $1000 down or $2000 down, I decided to put 0 down , when I saw the final costs, I asked them why so high, they told me because interest rate,,,, I believed at that time, after that, finance manager told me to sign the paperwork, I thought the manager is honest, but I am wrong, he put all optional protection to the contract, almost $5500 more without I knew it, the final costs my used car is $27000, I don’t need optional service  protection $3500, gaps insurance $900, devices $800, key protection $400, I don’t need them at all, the sale manager has never asked me before, I called him today, he did had attitude, ,,,,,,,I felt very upset, very worst dealership,< /Review>

<text>I spent a large portion of the holiday season shopping for a new car and the ONLY reason that I chose to drive all the way out to El Monte and lease from Patriot was because of the outstanding customer service and prompt replies from Prashant Sadani. I wish I was able to give more than 5 stars - the process with quick and painless and I strongly recommend anyone looking for a car reaches out to Prashant at Patriot Hyundai.<//text>< Gmap_id>

<response>None<//response><Review>I went in on Labor Day 2019 to buy a 2019 Tucson that I had already scoped out and selected online from their inventory. Maggie was the first person to greet us at the door and was so friendly and direct. We told her exactly what car we wanted and had all the price and information ready to go--she understood that, arranged to get the car from their secondary lot, was super knowledgeable about the vehicle, and made things move quickly. It was so great to not hassle or haggle with someone! She took care of all of the logistics while we waited for finance (which took some time because it was Labor Day). She remained attentive and ensured that we got seen as quickly as possible. She also sent the car back to get a small stain removed when we noticed it at the very end of the transaction. It was a great experience and I'm super happy with my car.<//Review><Name>Albert Angelica Garcia Pena<//Name>< Date>

I drove down from Palos Verdes.  one might wonder why I would buy a car in El Monte!  Well let me tell you, buying a car now a days is a crazy journey.  You get 10 people calling you all over the place with the same story "I WILL GIVE YOU THE BEST DEAL!  I am a busy man and don't have time to go into 3 different dealerships and negotiate.  My first call was from Maggie at Patriot Hyundai of El Monte.  Not only did she make a great impression, she provided me with absolutely everything I asked for from pricing of the vehicle to pictures and videos of the actual car.  She also made the buying process simple and easy.  I was in and out within an hour and a half.  My Finance Manager Tupu was amazing.  She was patient, thorough and I did not feel pressured into purchasing anything extra.  She did such a good job explaining the options that would protect my investment.  Thank you Maggie, Tupu and to the rest of the team at Patriot Hyundai for this pleasant experience.  Be sure to ask for Maggie if you want an easy, quick and no haggle process.  I love my 2020 Hyundai Palisade!< /review>

For online reservation only, scheduled 1:30PM for fixing a recall with simple oil change and tire rotation. Got confirmation text message and email. Arrived @ 1:20PM and was told that have to wait at least 3.5 - 4 hours.  They are closing @ 6PM? And asked me to come back next day...... what's the purpose for confirming appointment?
DO NOT TRUST THEIR WEB SITE FAKE APPOINTMENT TIME. Try to call them before heading out.</review>

They had a car for sale online that said new for sale. I drove 2 hours to find out it was used with 5k miles and overpriced. You could literally buy in online and it wasn’t what was advertised. Terrible experience and customer service.</Text>

Never buy a Hyundai! Always breaking down and customer service is horrendous. My vehicle lit up with hybrid system error and turn off engine. The service rep stated it was dangerous to drive but refuse to offer a rental. To top it off he said very articulately if you want to drive the vehicle even tho is a danger to you. Selling my vehicle immediately. Class action suit come soon.<//review>

I recently bought a Hyundai Kona Electric from Patriot Hyundai.  I had been shopping around for awhile and was discouraged by some of the sales tactics I'd encountered in the fully electric vehicle market.  Patriot Hyundai treated me very well from the moment I called.  The offer price was reasonable and Sean treated me very well with any questions I had and took all the time I needed on a lengthy test drive.  I highly recommend at least stopping by this place to comparison shop!</text>

< Review>
My husband and I walked in to Hyundai at El Monte to just "take a look" as we weren't really sure what we wanted as far as for a new family SUV. Prashant walked out and gave us such an amazing no pressure experience. He was very patient with us and explained all the features of each type of SUV they offered, new and used options on their lot, and when we narrowed things down - the ways we could save depending on which trim we chose. He is a great listener and has many years of experience. We felt he really catered and individualized the discussion to what our family needed. He cut through the bull and went straight to the point of what was practical. He really left an impression and after looking at other dealerships we went back to Prashant to buy our 2020 Hyundai Tucson with just the right amount of bells and whistles our family needed. He made it very easy and gave important tips that ended up saving us a pretty penny. Can't recommend him and this dealership enough!</Review>

I walked into the lot with the intention of just getting some information. Sales associate William greeted me I told him I was only looking around no intention of purchasing anything today with no pressure he answered every single one of my questions. He showed me a very nice van. I went home and thought about it overnight the next day I went back to the dealershipwith my special needs son and the intention of test driving that van. William were so kind to my son he kept him occupied while I signed contractsI believe I got a good price and a good car and  I will gladly work with William in the future.😀<//review>

<Review>I came in on Saturday to see if I was able to trade in my Hyundai Elentra , I had no hopes because honestly I know it’s not easy because I wanted the Hyundai Sonata 2020 But when we got there, right away Jhojan Garcia helped me out, he was really nice and very helpful, he went out of his way to see if I could get the car I wanted , next thing you know I was able to get my Hyundai Sonata 2020 I am So So HAPPY with my purchase and very grateful with Jhojan that he helped me and was looking for the color and interior I wanted if you guys ever want to purchase I recommend Hyundai of El Monte this is my second time I come here and honestly their staff are the nicest and ask for Jhojan Garcia, he is really nice and will go out of his way to help you as much as he can< /Review>< pics>

Jhojan Garcia and Alex Banuelos are very professional. Not only were they very knowledgeable of every feature but willing to explain with detail. I recommend everyone looking for a great car at a fair price to come see Jhojan and Alex!!!<//Text>

<review>My parents were looking to buying me my 1st car and I wanted something nice the very 1st person who contacted me Was Beatrice she was absolutely the most caring salesperson I came across everyone kept saying come on in, I explained both of my parents work all the time and they wanted to do most of the negotiations over the phone and just go in the dealership and sign paperwork. She called each and one of them got all the info, Jhojan then contacted me sent me pictures of cars and to not make this sooo long we went in and signed paperwork we were out in 1 hour! Amazing team work everyone is nice and helpful! Thank you Beatrice and Jhojan.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Yesterday my life changed for the better. From the first phone conversation Jhojan exhibited the utmost confidence in his ability to help me in my financial dilemma
that nobody else cared to help make better.
I walked in with a 19% APR on a dead end road to nowhere. And not a penny to put  down. I had almost lost hope. But I made one last call to Patriot Hyundai in El Monte, and I have to say they changed my life for the better.
I am today driving a 2019 Elantra at a 3.9% APR and ZERO out of pocket. I know buying a vehicle is not the first thing we want to do. But if you want to work with people who to me have demonstrated the ability to not only make a sale but actually help. Call Patriot. Call Jhojan Garcia. I cannot thank them enough for what they helped me accomplish financially. 🙏🙏🙏
Sincerely,
AR</Text>

I went to Patriot Hyundai of El Monte looking for a car,  Because I recently got an a total lost I'm on the market for a new car not quite ready to purchase a vehicle just yet but definitely looking. That is when Jhojan Garcia Approach me I told him my situation he didn't not walk away from me like all the dealerships had  and provide me with a lot of information and one of a few test drives. I'm truly thankful for the customer service that Patriot Hyundai of El Monte offer me. When I'm ready to buy my vehicle I will be visiting Jhojan Garcia at Patriot Hyundai of El Monte</Review>

The lady that work at the service desk told me if I don't purchase their $220 maintenance package my 2018 sonata it can die on me in the middle of the freeway. Not sure if this is true or not, but regardless, after my lease is over I will never get a hyundai ever again. I'll also make sure everyone I know avoid these cars and this dealership as well.< /review>

Purchased a vehicle.

Was informed that it was being sent out to be detailed.  Instead it was washed.

When delivered it was missing some items that were supposed to be included.

Attempted to get the items delivered or return the vehicle to the dealership.

Phone calls not returned.

Voicemails ignored, and then making statements like the phone system is defective.

Employees, when asked why no call back, indicating must have been because of an emergency, when in reality, they have no idea.

All in all I'd look for a dealership with employees who have better character and do what they say they will do and not directly lie to customers.</text>

<Review>Hands down best service ever! We purchased our first Hyundai Sonata from Downey with Tupu.. totaled our sonata when someone ran a red light, so went back to Tupu when she had transferred to Huntington & she helped us into a Kona.. then we followed her to El Monte to trade that in for our new Santa Fe! We LOVE IT & we LOVE HER! Go pay her a visit, she’ll take care of you. Thank you Tupu!!♥️< /Review>< userid>

<rate>1<//rate><review>(Translated by Google) Well, the truth is that I am very disappointed in hyunday elantra 2016, we bought a very nice car but now the car is failing a year ago, it broke down when it is understood, it does not want to start, it was fixed according to them but again it is doing the same, my question is if they composed it because he is doing it again, my car has been in the dealer for 2 weeks and they don't find him that he is so sad and angry because one invests the money in a new car so as not to be struggling to get rid of it, I don't know what to do the truth hopefully nobody happens to him.

Pues la verdad yo estoy muy desilusionada de hyunday elantra 2016 nosotros compramos uno muy bonito el carro pero ahora el carro esta fallando hace un año se descompuso cuando se ensiende no quiere arrancar ya lo arreglaron segun ellos pero otra vez esta haciendo lo mismo,mi pregunta es si lo compusieron porque lo esta volviendo hacer,mi carro lleva 2 semanas en el dealer y no le encuentran q tiene estoy tan triste y enojada porque uno invierte el dinero en un carro nuevo para no andar batallando aque se desconponga,no se que hacer la verdad ojala  a nadie le pase.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Text>The cauliflower crust is super crispy and delicious!  You can choose from preset menu items or customize your own order with unlimited toppings.  So many topping choices!

The pizza salad was basically an entire salad on the side with the pizza crust.  Next time I might try the toppings baked into the pizza so the meat isn’t cold.  But it was nice to have a refreshing salad on a hot day.  Everything was fresh and tasty.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlh-a_k0Vy_JknoSqtz-HcGRAx9uklYK0Xt-oJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO79AoKnvFj_HDMM17_N8gjL1fDcJ7RYYWdZC-K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAmCB2mPXh3bRw__1vl5_BytnCfvJJnzQVYtVT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTGCPuivRs5SFOy7FN_BWGO4UJUZayx5HFsocu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

You choose everything you want on the pizza, and it is cooked for you to your liking on the spot. They have a fantastic variety with pretty good quality ingredients. My only complaint is the wait, and the weird smelling parking lot.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Love Mod Pizza. This location seems larger than those I've been to before. Went at off peak time which was nice - no line or wait. The one employee working was very nice and helpful from start to finish. Even with all the choices for toppings, I always seem to get the same ones-still love the variety though. Nice to have more options on "the Hill" than there was before. There is also a Fish Grill type of restaurant and a Habit burger joint right next door.</Review>< Pictures>

Love this place,  and would recommend (great to eat outside too).  One star taken off because lately the roasted garlic,  usually oh so good,  had been undercooked.<//Text>

Great quality and very friendly service. You can sellect a pizza from their list or, of course make your own.the double crust is a good idea if you are going to load it up. It can get soggy so I get twice baked.
There is a great patio with umbrellas. Lots of parking available. It can take a while if the line is long. Look at pics for menu and details. Please like if helpful.<//text>

Usually I go to Blaze and this was our first time to MOD, but we were treated really nicely as we explored how we could create our own pizza with the ingredients available here. The person making our pizza was very helpful in providing recommendations like blue cheese and letting us try some of their sauces. The Buffalo Sauce elevated our pizza to a new level and I think I've got a personal preference to this experience over Blaze.</Text>

I made a mistake with my online order and accidentally ordered for 5:15pm when I meant to order for 5:30pm.  I arrived at my expected time but since I mistakenly set the order for earlier the pizzas were already sitting out and waiting.   I asked for the pizza to be heated up real quick but the staff offered to make NEW pizzas!  Totally unexpected,  great customer service and attention!  Thank you!< /text>

<Text>The Pizza was great as always. I ordered the ‘Dillon James’ with additional topping of Mushrooms. I got my pizza within 10 minutes of ordering. Fresh, crispy and tasty! This MOD Pizza location is located in a fair-sized shopping plaza. The neighborhood is upscale and cozy.<//Text>< Rate>

< Review>
They literally mislabeled every single one of their chocolate no name cakes so I ended up buying 6 nasty birthday cake flavor cakes instead of chocolate. And I’m sure as heck not gonna drive back there to trade them out for the chocolate because I’m never going to MOD again. Their pizza is mediocre their sauce is subpar I only come here truly for these chocolate cakes and for me to waste my money buying 6 cakes that end up being wrong flavor that is just the nail in the coffin.  How hard is it to do your job properly ???????

Every single time I’ve ever been here they always mess up the order. I’ve given them enough opportunities and I’m done now.

No chocolate cake is worth enduring the never ending mess ups.<//Review>

MOD is one of those build your own pizza joints and unlike similar chains this one is actually good, as in the pizza tastes amazing. The crust is thin and therefore cooks up perfectly. More importantly, it has real flavor. There's a wide choice of toppings and you can put as many on your pizza as you want for one price--nice. They also offer salads, local beers on tap and desserts. The staff is super friendly and engaged which makes going to MOD a nice experience. And it's very reasonably priced.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<review>I love pizza, and when this store opened I was thrilled. Great quality, lovely people, and delicious pizza. I decided that pizza would be great so I went to Mod to get some. As I walked in I noticed that there where some new people there. The lady who took my order was very rude. I asked for some more sauce and she very rudely said that it would make it soggy. As I asked again she reluctantly gave it to me. I miss the other people. Other than that it was ok.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80dd4b90f67e92d9:0x212c86e52e2ca48e</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I wanted so much to love this place, as I'm a big fan of Blaze Pizza. The overall experience, although I know today was opening day, was not good. First, I waited 13 minutes in a short line just to order my pizza. There was a staff of 16-17 people I counted but only one person to take the pizza order!? People were indecisive when they turn the corner of the line to be greeted by the order taker (even though I knew exactly what I wanted). One guy literally had to be asked 7+ questions just before they got his first pizza ordered! Then once I was able to order a MINI Ella, it took another 22 minutes to get the pizza. No one checked with me or asked if I wanted anything while I was waiting. Overall, 35 minutes for one mini pizza. It is good but not that good to wait so long. I think they should be taking orders much sooner and get people moved through the line faster and they should talk to the customers more. The guy at the pizza preparing counter liked to talk but never gave anyone an update about their pizza. No number system, no table signs. And the WORST was no WIFI at all? So I waited for 35 minutes with no Wifi or cell service (it's a dead zone for Verizon right in their spot for some reason). I wish I could like it, but overall I had a bad experience.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHRYQkngjqWJ81jqudQ8cgDjyBxSPbWTG0wyRN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

Love this chain!!
Great place for build your own Pizza, if you havent tried Mod, you have to try it. So good and quick.
I always get great pizza because i can put exactly what i want on it. One Price and you can pile on whatever you want. Ive never heard them say No.
Great selection of toppings, get a pie in pretty fast time.
Im definitely a fan of this chain, if you havent tried it, check it out.< /Review>

I used to frequent Mod weekly. A year ago, I cut out dairy from my diet. Without cheese, I deemed pizza a lost cause. On a whim, I popped into Mod, pondered a pie without cheese, scanned the ingredients available, and had the pie maker piece together a masrerpiece. Pizza without cheese is not a sin. In fact, I hardly noticed it was missing. The selection of parts for your pie at Mod is 2nd to none. And everything is fresh amd tasty. The crust makes the pie and at Mod, the crust is in tune and on pitch.<//review>

<Review>The pizza here is good. It’s just that one of the employees came in here (probably from break) shouting I’m back and kinda shocked us. She grabbed a cup and filled it with soda and disappeared into the back of the kitchen. She seemed so messy. Her hands looked dirty. I wouldn’t want someone to come in like that and make my pizza.</Review><gmapID>0x80dd4b90f67e92d9:0x212c86e52e2ca48e<//gmapID><response>None<//response><time>1534121782962</time>< pics>

I love that you can really "have it your way" with ingredients from special suppliers, different sauces, and more interesting toppings than most other places! MOD - "Made On Demand" while you watch. The wait isn't very long to get your pizza, either!</Text>

<Review>We walked in. Looked on the clearly printed menu choices.
Chose to do the 6 incher so we could experience two set flavors.
We learned that we, at no charge, get to add toppings.
Awesome!
Value.
Artichoke hearts too! WILD!
WAY GOOD!
FOUNTAIN DRINKS ARE PRICED PERFECTLY!!!!!
Thank you for coming "up" here.
Great!
The staff is very friendly.

< Review>
This place is ok. It's no Blaze. I asked for my pizza well done, and after a team of eye rolls, my pizza looked like it went into a blender. Don't ask for any adjustments after the pizza is cut (like having it cooked longer)... Just have them remake it. He told me, "Sorry it looks bad. It'll taste the same." Meh. No thanks.</Review>

Had an appointment for a COVID test and waited over 45 mins. Would not recommend going here for a covid test when so many other places will do this efficiently and on time.

EDITED: more than 1.5 hours in and out to get a simple covid test. Will not be coming back.<//text>

Management, tell your employees to provide transparency on drastic delays for appointments. For example, if they’re over an hour behind and you’re standing in the rain, please have the people at the front desk communicate that to the people in line.< /review>

If there were more places like this that worked like clockwork like the folk here do, then we would have beaten this Pandemic already.
Also, the staff are friendly and professional.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c2bb4ee099eac9:0x9a6cddf09578f9ec< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I visited Brentwood Urgent Care yesterday while visiting the city. I was seen promptly and efficiently with care and knowledge by the staff and the doctor. It was a very pleasant experience. This morning I received a totally unexpected follow-up call checking on my condition. I wish I received this level of care from my own doctor on the East Coast. It has been a most heart-warming experience and the treatment is improving my condition. Thank you.<//text>

<Review>Wow! I was hesitant to come here after seeing some of the reviews, but they accepted my medi-cal insurance and I was desperate, and I'm so glad I did!

They verified my insurance over the phone and made sure the Dr. On duty was able to diagnose the issue I was going in for, before I went in, which was really nice.

The reason I went was because I was convinced I had a kidney infection. I looked it up and had every symptom. My general doctor said I probably had Coronavirus and that's what they were going to test me for.... Not my kidney... , so I immediately left and found the Brentwood Urgent care. They saw me within 30 minutes, and the Dr immediately said, It sounds like a kidney infection and was shocked the other Dr would say otherwise. And of course, after tests, it was kidneys!

They gave me an injection of antibiotics and a prescription for antibiotics for the week and I was soooo happy that I had gotten a 2nd opinion! The whole office was so nice and efficient. I am shocked that anyone would give them a bad review! I will definitely be coming here from now on when I have an urgent issue!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Clean Facility, knowledgeable Staff
End of December - my husband cut his index finger while slicing a baguette - it was a gusher. We arrived at Brentwood Urgent Care at 7:45 and were greeted  warmly by the staff who remained past closing time help. Wound care supplies were plentiful. The assistant cleaned the wound thoroughly, the doctor glued the cut and applied durable bandages. we left with instructions, supplies and even a follow up call. The finger healed easily. This is the first urgent care facility that I can truly  recommend!< /review>

Been there a handful of times, and it's always been better than other urgent cares in the area, but that isn't necessarily saying much. I went in last week and was told by the doctor that I only had a cold and to go home, take Tylenol and wait it out. I did so and actually began to feel better after a couple of days. But then the nasal congestion I was feeling returned and spread to my ear. The doctor said this might happen, so I called and inquired whether I would have to pay for a second visit since it is still within a week of my last visit. I was told that I would indeed have to pay again. Other urgent cares (such as one in Hollywood and another Downtown) offer a free return visit if symptoms persist within a week. Not Brentwood. Very disappointing. At this point, I'll wait and see. If I get worse, I'll try and see an ENT. An ENT would have a lower copay anyway. Never returning.<//text><time>1568844673938< /time><response>None</response>< user>

I had a great experience going to Brentwood Urgent Care when I was sick. They took me in even though I arrived really close to their closing time. I was quickly diagnosed and didn't even have to go to a pharmacy to get my medicine. The cost was very reasonable (~$149 for first visit, $99 for subsequent visits). Would definitely go back here again, though hope I don't have to :)</text>

I injured myself at a concert and don't have a primary physician in the area, so I called ahead to make an appointment for the day. They had no problem getting me in and there was no wait time once I arrived. The doctors were pleasant and helpful, and I was in and out in a timely manner. Only downfall was the operator who took my call was slightly unpleasant.</review>

I have been to the West Coast Urgent Care in Pasadena as well and both places are excellent.  At this location I saw Dr. Miller and he was funny, professional and knowledgeable.

The wait time to be taken back was almost non-existent and I was seen in and out in 30 minutes.  Quickest, easiest doctor visit ever!  I should note that they only take walk-ins and it is kind of amazing that I had such a short wait.

I will definitely recommend both of these places to friends and family.< /text>

< Review>
I came here to get a TB test and physical for work and they were very fast and efficient! In fact, I think it was the best urgent care experience I've ever had. I waited less than 10 minutes to be seen and all the staff seemed very friendly. I would definitely come here in the future for any other needs. They also have their own parking spaces which is very convenient!</Review>

The moment I walked in, I was greeted with smiles from the sweetest people.  I have been to urgent care before but I never experienced such speedy service like I did here. If anyone is looking for genuine care without being rushed, COME HERE!!< /text>

First I called to be sure they accept my insurance. They actually took the time to check and confirmed they do. When I arrived they created a computer print out of my coverages and expected co-pay.  I value their professionalism and providing me with this information because I hate surprises and I've had too many times when people have said oh yes you're covered and then found out that I'm not.
The nurse took my vitals and went over what was ailing me and previous conditions very thoroughly. When the doctor came in she was very compassionate, kind and focused entirely just on me. She was very thorough also. They sent me with the proper prescription. They were even kind enough  to follow up on the phone the next day to see how I'm doing. I cannot ask for more and I'm super happy to know that this places there is should I need them again.<//Review>

This place is better than my doctor's office. If I lived in this area, I'd go here before calling my doctor. I had excruciating back pain while on vacation here. Both the staff and doctor were quick and very attentive. Thank you Dr. Robins.<//text>

Visited recently because I was feeling well. The doctor on duty Dr. Nyugen just kept taking notes, did no checkup, was not to diagnose what was going on and was not able to answer any questions. She kept on saying that "here we just check if a patient should go to ER or not". She wanted to do a urine test since she had nothing else to say. They just did the paperwork and charged me for the visit.
Only one star because the staff is nice and professional. Not going here again< /text>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>Visit was going well until I had to deal with Tanya.  It's really a shame how one nasty person can ruin an otherwise good experience.  But that's what happened when my medical group sent me to this facility and Tanya went out of her way to be purposely disagreeable and uncooperative.  She actually refused to send the medical order that the doctor wrote to my provider, the very group who sent me to this facility in the first place.  One bad apple can spoil the whole bunch and Tanya managed to do exactly that.  This visit was a complete waste of time and money.  But the Tanyas of the world don't care about healthcare.</review>< userid>

The person who helped me and took me for a tour was extremely helpful, friendly and gave me a very good impression, but the only thing is that to sign up needed to have my bank account number which I don't usually carry it with me, so after going home I sign up to try it out, so far it's been good.< /text>< Pics>

This was mine and my friends first time going to this particular planet fitness. When I arrived I informed them it was my first time there, they quickly got me registered and helped me with my guest pass for my friend. Everyone was respectful and most if not all of the patrons were good about cleaning after themselves and wiping down the equipment after use.<//Review>

<Name>Alex C.</Name>< review>
Cancelled my membership in person back in 2018 when I had to move states. I filled in the form and turned it in. Many months later, I learned that Planet Fitness was still charging my account membership fees. I called the customer service line and they told me that whoever took my cancellation form at this location never put it in their system. Their solution was for me to cancel again. So I tried doing that but I lived hours away from any location and tried sending certified mail which also never worked. I have never dealt with such an enormous headache like this before. I liked the gym and would've rejoined at another location, but they made cancelling into such a pain that I wouldn't recommend Planet Fitness to my worst enemy. Eventually I had to call my bank to flag their withdrawals as fraud. Be careful when cancelling and make sure they send you a confirmation email.<//review>

She canceled my membership after she had a disagreement with my gym partner about wearing his mask at the bridge of his nose. Extremely unprofessional because I literally did not have anything to do with the situation. She canceled both of our membership after we left the facility and had another staff member call us both to inform us about our cancellation. She couldn’t even call us herself and she put coronavirus for the reason for canceling our membership on our documents via email. She couldn’t even have an adult conversation because she appeared aggravated when my gym partner attempted to speak to her. Overall very petty of manager Angel.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< rate>

These MFs were closed for 6 months for the pandemic. They open up a couple days before a billing cycle and hit every member with a bill and refuse to refund them. Claiming you have to write a certified lette to cancel your membership. Where do you send this letter when they are closed bot taking calls and obviously can't walk in to ask. At the end of the day it was $23 they could have refunded and I would go on with my day. But they chose a 1 star review.</Review>

{'time': 1616678510352, 'text': "Thank you for voicing your concerns, Matthew! Our club was closed as we were adhering to local guidelines. As soon as we reopened, updates were posted to our club page: planetfitness.com/gyms/upland-ca. We always ask that our members keep an eye on our club page that way you all stay in the loop! Additionally, once our club reopens, your normal billing resumes as your membership becomes active. Since you're charged within the terms of your agreement, it is typically non-refundable. However, our club manager would ultimately be your best point of contact for any refund requests!\n\nIf you'd like to cancel your membership, you can either go in person and sign a cancellation form at the front desk with a staff member or you can send a letter by regular or certified mail to our club. You can find our address on our club page that we linked previously. To cancel your membership by regular mail, all you would need to do is place the signed letter in a stamped envelope in your mailbox and the club will handle your cancellation request accordingly. As for the contents of the letter, we ask that you put your name, the reason for canceling, contact information, and your written signature.\n\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please give our club a call at (909) 297-5090 and request to speak with our club manager. We sincerely hope you'll stay as a member of our PF family but if not, we wish you the best of luck on your amazing fitness journey!"}< /Response>

Staff is always friendly, professional & helpful at this facility. They follow their own plus the city's guidelines & I appreciate it a lot. It's very clean. Masks & sanitizing equipment before & after each use is a MUST at this time & they hold people accountable (which is rare these days), politely asking everyone whom they see not following the rules to abide by them & it's very appreciated.<//text>

It's always clean and if I go to any City I can use their bathroom because of my membership. I can take a guest or friend with me anytime I want and we can work out. I wish the kids could come here but for the price it's pretty good. It's always spotless.< /review>

PF has a bad reputation in the bodybuilding community but I like it. Granted the weights don't go very high and they only have smith machines but it works for me and will work for those who aren't trying to get huge.

I've only been here twice so far but its always clean and well organized. The guy at the front is friendly always saying hello.

I come at 4am on weekdays so I can't speak for the rush hour between 4-8pm.< /review>

That one EMPLOYEE that unexpectedly takes a DAY OFF to VEGAS MAKES the ONE EMPLO. and fitness environment not do 100% satisfaction.

- NO TOWELS FOR either side
- 1 STAFF HAVING TO WORK 200% scanning and turning on the massage machines and clean the machines and overseeing the PF. BUILDING.

GET YOUR priorities straight, WORK AS A TEAM AND PLAN AHEAD.</text>

I signed up for the black card membership and have had no issues going to other gyms around the area.  The staff is friendly, and the extra ten bucks a month is well worth it to be able to bring a friend and use the message chairs.  Happy I joined!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

This expensive gym is brand new with new equipment and very clean cause its NEW.  The perfect little gym for people new to working out and for quick workouts.

Located next to The Spot Cafe (a healthy Cafe serving Juice and Healthy Food). Its easy to see from either Mountain or Foothill.  I always order a juice on The Spot Cafes app when I work out and they deliver it right to the front desk of Planet Fitness.  So easy and convenient having the two right next to each other.< /text>

This gym would be five stars if they were open 24 hours a day 7 days a week however they are not. I don't understand why a place that is so busy all of the time wouldn't stay open for 24 hours on the weekends. It boggles my mind.

The reason why it is four stars is that as far as planet fitness type gyms go this has all of the equipment that you need. It has a wide selection of dumbbells a wide selection of machines and a really nice cardio area complete with televisions on the cardio machines.< /review>

Although they encourage people to park ones own bicycles for anyone's in business inside their gym they don't guarantee their security and its at their own risk.

I got my bicycle stolen when it was chained and locked with heavy duty equipment but it still wasn't enough, when I asked the service desk all they said to fill out a Planet fitness form, that was it.

A Poor business practices and could be improved upon but has choosen not to, I left planet fitness upland CA for this reason and will be going somewhere else better.

Also keep in mind, I am not the only person that has gotten their bicycle stolen.</Text>< userid>

Nice selection of vehicles. They don't speak or seem to understand the English language well. It becomes an issue when you are searching for a vehicle to purchase.<//review>

<text>The best dealer experience by far. I came here because a family member recommended La Playita to me. So far, I know of 4 immediate friends and family members that have had an excellent dealer experience with them. I am always trading in vehicles, so I have visited many dealerships before and have plenty of experience. The sales rep was very nice, informative and professional. I called in and scheduled a test drive and he was not pushy trying to sell me a car once the ride was over. I was able to trade in my used 2008 F150 and they gave me a fair price for trade in. It came in handy for a down payment and some extra money to take home. I am now the new owner of a 2016 F150. I did my research and had an idea of what I was willing to pay vs fair market value. The dealer gave me a good price with easy financing. I would recommend this dealer to friends and family and I know I will be returning for their business.  Also, the manager was awesome. He was was able to negotiate for a good trade in price.< /text><resp>None</resp><name>Mariano Del Rey</name>< gmap_id>

We arrived to see a Vehicle and ask the price and Milage. The car salesman was just standing there looking at us like, Why are you here!!! He told us the price and left. Couldn’t ask any further questions. We remained there for 10 min. Nobody ever came back out. Very poor customer service if you ask me!!! I will take my business elsewhere!!!!<//review>

We were originally helped by a very helpful Man, honestly I can’t remember his name. But Jose was the one who did everything he could to get us to leave with the Car we Originally fell in love with. I’d recommend them to anyone. Best experience we had. (& we went to a lot of dealerships) We are looking forward to coming back & getting another vehicle in the future!!</Review>

My husband purchased his truck here as a first time car buyer. Our salesman was really easy to work with, he tried to help us out the best he could in regards to the loan.
A couple months after we purchased our truck we noticed a noise had gotten worse (they had initially said it was due to the truck being lifted). We took the truck in and they fixed the problem within a couple of days, staying true to their word.< /text>

Worst place I’ve ever been too. The manager was so rude to us not to mention the prices here are outrageous. Bought myself a much better car at a better price compared to here with a ver low down payment at Dana’s Discount in Tulare. Go there and ask for Jesse . They have much better customer service prices and friendly people.< /review>

Sold my son a truck that had several issues that they never took care of and finally told him the truck was no longer under their warranty.  The main issue was related to the fuel smell my son complained about since day one which he took it to you guys for repair. All you told him was he needed a new gas cap. We took it to a mechanic who traced the fuel that was leaking down the tank and found that a part on the fuel pump was cracked almost completely and whenever the key was turned on gas would spray everywhere!! He could have been hurt or worse if the tank ever ignited. I will never reccomend this place and will tell everyone I know about this.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<text>Not great.  Overly sweet, not refreshing.  Ordered the raspada piña colada which was shaved ice, too much flavored syrup, shredded coconut and some pineapple.  The coconut was the kind that comes from a bag and the pineapple tasted like canned pineapple.  I was disappointed.<//text>< UserId.>

It has an okay service. Food is not anything extraordinery. The mangoneadas taste the same as if u buy them from the "Elotero Man" and if you're craving ice cream some Ben and Jerry's should do the trick..<//Review>

<Text>DO NOT SHOP HERE!!! I will never return to this store! The customer service was horrible. I was looking to buy guayaberas. They did not have all the sizes I needed. I bought 2 from one store on 4th St and was told they had the other sizes in their other store on 1st, only to get their & they didn't. On top of that they charge me more money & did not honor the price I had just paid. I clearly heard the owner/manager tell the associate to charge $2 more because he had just brought them... BUT they had not been put out on the sales floor at that time. The girl & the owner/manager were extremely rude. I could have taken my business elsewhere but I needed these shirts for my mom's funeral. They did NOTHING to correct their mistake or make the situation better. BEWARE OF THIS STORE & USE CAUTION WHEN BUYING FROM THEM. THEY ALL COULD USE BETTER BUSINESS SENSE & LESS GREED!! If I could give ZERO STARS I would. DO NOT SHOP HERE!!<//Text>< rating>

It was relatively inexpensive with the wait staff being nice, the only issue would be that they need to contact law enforcement more as a result of wannabe gangsters tagging their walls<//review>

Bad experience with the actual store owner and associate.
Ordered boots and made a deposit of half of the amount of order. It took almost 3 weeks to get them when they had said a week, when I went to pick them up and pay the rest of the order. Apparently they were not the price I was paying and were charging me more. I guess the prices “range” when they do special orders.. that was not mentioned at all when I originally purchased, i also read the exchange/return policy but did not mention anything of that sort. I refused to pay the new amount and guy basically told me to pay the new amount or I could leave.
So rude and unprofessional. Be careful wen you order things from this place..<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Good service, My first time bought boots for my daughter and the many helped us with our questions gave us options for the right boot for my daughter and although I had to return a couple of times and not for any bad reason, the girls were always . flexible and above all very friendly, I personally would recommend El vaquero, good service 👍👍

<text>They sent me junk advertising mail labeled "2019 important documents SECOND NOTICE" Inside was a misleading ad saying that my MediCal dental benefits have improved and I can use them at, and presumably only at, my "Assigned Location", followed by their address and signed Dr John Luther.

Dr John Luther, you are a disreputable businessman and I will never use your services.  You are a disgrace to your profession, and worse than a fool to think that deception is an acceptable way to solicit new clientele.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPK0xzBZY3BvyHUC7thTs4rvcLkg-q81sYVeBUT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1550795993226, 'text': 'Steven, we would like to know more about this situation and we invite you to speak with us directly for additional support at (866) 319-9409 or if you prefer, please send us an email at customerservice@westerndental.com'}<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Ielene was the best and made the whole process as simple as can be. Stephanie was able to help me figure out the billing process and find the best solution. The whole process was fast and handled with the upmost care. Dr. Rolle easily explained my dental needs and was definitely handed with the best care.<//Text>

< Review>
First timer here, was very busy and both of my appointments were delayed by an hr. The orthodontist had dry sarcasm which made my mood even worse.
But what made me come back was thanks to Iraiz! who helped me out with everything along the way and made sure I had my needs taken care of!
And thanks to the manager on making room for my exam even though you were full.</Review>

<text>Everyone I spoke to was kind and helpful. I'm a new patient and got evaluated and my teeth cleaned (after not going to any dentist in a very long time) and the process as easy and relieved a lot of the anxiety I had coming in. I had Dr. Miranda and there were many other people what helped with my care and were great. Explained every step asked if I had questions, etc. Some of the people helping were Keren, Viri, and Iraiz, but seriously everyone was helpful.</text>< pics>

Dr Rolle was very pleasant and explained everything to me. Alycia the hygienist was very patient while doing my cleaning and I kept moving around and Karen was friendly and helpful throughout the entire visit. This is a great place and I look forward to coming back<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Worst experience  at a dentist second time coming for wisdom teeth because they only have one guy that comes once a month and after waiting for 3 hours AFTER checking in we were sent home cause he had gone home and had to reschedule for a month later next appt comes up we get here an hour early to check in we waited almost 4 hours before getting seen and had to do 45 minutes more worth of paper work all the while my fiancée had not been able to eat or drink even water for 12 hours cause of the wait then we had to pay an unexpected expense that we had not been informed of totaling 500 dollars on top of that they aren't following covid guidelines very well no social distancing of the sort  either and the parking lot is an absolute disaster due to all wisdom teeth patients having to be scheduled on the same day people were parking on the fire curb  just to fit  they really need to get their schedule in order do not recommend coming here and I will not be returning< /Review>

Fast pace, wait time was not long. I recommend this place. I got a clean up & they are professional at extracting tooth, I felt no pain during & the extraction was only 3 minutes. I’ll be back to work on my teeth here & I always do.<//review><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

I am a first time patient here, the service so far has been phenomenal! Dr. Miranda diagnosed my dire need for braces, which I was completely unaware of ; in the process helping me find the underlying reason for my back pain. Since a young age I’ve been aware of a misalignment in my skeleton & now I am finally made aware of the root problem. I feel beyond satisfied not only was I able to resolve this problem, we also began my dental care plan. Heydee took my x-rays very carefully & made sure any questions I had were answered successfully, afterwards I met Keren which also helped clarify the remainder of my questions. She was extremely helpful in explaining the pros and cons of regular braces, & clear braces. Up until now I had no idea there were even any differences, I will definitely be completing my dental care plan here. They are also very welcoming and kind to children!!< /Review>

Went in for a crown today. Dr. Khasru and Chris helped make sure we got the perfect placement. Chris is friendly and guides through the whole process. Really helped me put at ease. Dentist visits are not my favorite and this visit was different than my other visits. Ladies at the front are friendly as well.<//text>

They are straight up greedy.  They over charge for simple procedures they others charge half the price for. They sting you along or even lie about things you need when you don't. This is the case of name brand charging expensive prices because you are paying for the name.  You aren't getting better service.</text>

<text>Went in because I had an infected broken tooth and wanted to know about bridges for my impacted canines.. They herd you in this open room where you can see other patients. Proceed to spit out codes to the assistant. Make you watch a video about their patented peroxide inserts.

To top it off their low quote was 5gs for extractions and implants when I clearly stated I didn't want implants. Also didn't even quote me on the bridges I asked for. 21gs for all the work they recommend which didn't address the things I asked for. Called a real dentists and got my infected tooth out the next day. Also she gave me a clear plan to get where I wanted while also addressing the other work I needed. Will cost me around 5gs but that will include fixing the impacted canines.

P.s. I stated twice on the website when I made the appointment, 2 times when I checked in and once on the way out I wasn't interested and they still quoted me for braces. Not worth the hassle for the "free" exam and X-rays</text><gmap_id>0x80db415e8bda4dad:0xf75038a4173a0cc</gmap_id><userid>110243874316165465160<//userid><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>

Unfortunately wouldn’t let me give zero stars. Horrible place, terrible costumer service. Office staff don’t care to hear your complaint or concern, they basically wave you off to hurry on to the next chart number. They don’t care about their patients or our time. Waited 2.5 hours to be sent home with nothing but X-rays because they way over book appointments (every time), told me they were closed and for me to reschedule after that long of a wait. We are just another number to them, I only went to them because it was a convenient location for me. I gave them a few chances but it has been the same every single time. Also, they make you write a positive google review for them before they do anything. At a previous visit I was sitting in the chair waiting for the dentist and was asked to do so, ( I have deleted that fake review) you feel obligated before you even receive treatment. They are such a large company you would think they would have mastered how to run a good business with decent costumer service. Definitely Would Not Recommend This Place!< /text>

Western Dental, Banning is awesome! Sylvia was very welcoming at the front desk and was pleasant to speak with. When I was called back for X-rays, Keren was phenomenal! She was very gentle took her time. She made sure I was comfortable and walked me through the whole time. I definitely recommend this office!</Review>

I went in today and after my x-rays was told I needed multiple things. I spoke with an assistant about my options and she served as the middle man between myself and my dentist. The dentist didn’t seem to care to speak with me directly and after he introduced himself he didn’t say a single word to me. I asked the assistant to have the dentist perform only what my insurance would completely cover and she came back and informed me that the dentist refused to work on me unless I got the other pricier work done. She went on to explain financing options and other ways to pay for this work like she was some sort of car salesman. I just wanted to get a couple fillings taken care of and take care of the pricier treatments when I can afford them. I’ll be looking for a new dentist.< /review>

<text>Waited 3 hours after our appointment time and still no word on when we were getting in. We were told they were “a little behind” when I asked. I had to complain twice and ask for the manager to come for them to start to process and get us back and going. Ended up being there almost 5 hours for less than 30 minutes of work. If the guys who helped during the surgery weren’t so nice and helpful I would have rated lower. Not sure if this is the norm here but it was not a great experience.< /text></record>

Came in for a root canal, I was attended right away as soon as I checked in.
Dr. Jameel did an amazing job, he walked me through the procedure and explained everything. I did not feel any pain or pressure through my procedure. The dental assistant Keren did awesome also, I felt very comfortable in her care. Hope to work with these two again if I need work done again. Awesome work!<//Text>

First time seeing him. He told me step by step what he was doing and made sure I was doing ok during the processes. He was the first one that didn’t have as much trouble putting my powerchain on. Great job Chris and Dr. Alexander.

<text>My name is Linda, I started my journey with W.D. the end of Aug., 2019. I was terrified. There was a young lady by the name of Angie that was able to calm me down during my journey. I was seen by Dr. Khasro & Dr. Chris, they took an interest in me. I was not just a number to them. They walked me through my procedures step by step and answered all of my questions & concerns in away that I was able to understand them. They were able to work wonders and because of them I now have a full mouth of teeth for the first time in many, many years. This office and their complete staff are very professional and at the same time they honestly take an interest in their patients. You guys are assume. God Bless you all.<//text>< date>

< Review>
Dr Khasru and Chris were amazing. I walked in in tears from the pain of my tooth thinking nothing would happen when I went in. Luckily for me I was wrong and they did an emergency extraction within 2 hours of me walking in without calling. This was my best experience here.< /Review>

Worst dental office.
I have had 2 appts here where they make you wait an hour or more in the waiting room. No one comes out to tell you theres a delay. Do not recommend this place.< /text>

<Text>Wait time is too long, have attended this office 3 times to complete a general cleaning and I continued to reschedule, due to getting admitted 40 min to 1 hr after my app. time. There is no sense of urgency in respecting patients time and commitment to appointment times. Not to mention issues with staff inputting accurate information into my chart and appointments not populating at time of check in. Lastly poor communication between office and corporate,  received several inaccurate billing calls. When I actually got the cleaning done I was not impressed with the quality of service. Please note doctor's were nice and the 2 front office girls (not the receptionists) sitting behind the girls that check in were polite and accommodating.<//Text><GmapID>0x80db415e8bda4dad:0xf75038a4173a0cc< /GmapID>< UserId.>

Poor scheduling. They schedule to many people at the same time. Each time I've came I've waited over 3hours to even be seen from the scheduled appointment time. I thought maybe it was just the day I came but this has happened every time I've had an appointment.< /review>

Cait was very helpful and knowledgable. She answered all my questions. She put me at ease and I had a great polishing experience.

Update: The wait to be seen even with an appointment is about an hour. The dentist always seems in a hurry and passes you off to other office staff. You have to really ask all the questions because no one will explain any care plan. I never knew what I was coming back in for until I was actually back in the dental chair. The two dental hygienists were always great.< /Text>

Today I feel like a real queen ! Two crowning glorious teeth that finally, after several months of feeling unattractively deprived and scary, Dr Khasru and his amazing and gentle professional assistance made it a true life changing moment.  Dr. Khasru is gifted and as knowledgeable as they come. I'm extremely fortunate to have him at my dentist office. Chris and Alycia shined the final glory as the best dental hygienists I've ever had! I can't wait to come back and I'm going to miss everyone for the next six months! I'm so humbled and grateful for this experience.</Text>

<text>Go in for my wisdom teeth and they didn't even seem worried about it, I'm in severe pain and all they wanted to do was sell me this gum disease package which was like $1,100, then he sent me home with Motrin 600 which did not work at all. Had to go to the er and they're the one that prescribe me antibiotics because my wisdom teeth was bad and infected. Smh it's all about money with these people won't wasted my time with them again< /text>< user>

Had to go to the er and they're the one that prescribe me antibiotics because my wisdom teeth was bad and infected.

The best!!!! I honestly was so nervous for my rootcanal and I have always been a little nervous to go to the dentist, after my experience with Dr. Jameel and his assistants Ieleen and Karen, I will no longer hesitate to fix what needs to be done with my teeth. Thank you so much for changing my perspective when it comes to the dentist 🤗</Text>

<text>My daughter in law works at this office, and my son brought my grandson here for treatment with the pediatric Dentist. And I heard that she did a wonderful job. So well that my grandson didn't cry or have a bad experience. He loved it and was showing off what he brought home from his appointment.< /text><pics>None<//pics><userid>106304399788375659688</userid>< Time>

So far  my experance  officewith goodthis  considering what I am going through.  I have so far had all my upper teeth pulled which now I wish that I had taken care of my teeth.  If you still have your teeth and they are in good condition please take care of them because not having them anymore really sucks.
They are vary nice and I do recommend going to this office.

What great service. Angelica, Chris, Keren, Ilene and Dr. Khasru were wonderful. Patient, and explained what was happening, why and how to treat it. Can't ask for better service. Would highly recommend.<//Review>

Was trying to put less than a star, place is a dump. Not that it's dirty or anything it's just so unorganized and unprofessional.  If you schedule an appointment you'll have a 45-60 minute wait until you are seen, if you don't have an appointment that number only goes up, good luck!  The dentist are all about money and will "recommend" so much work to be done so that they can make there buck and do a half ass job doing it.  I'm back here for the second time trying to get them to fix a filling so let see how this goes, had a nice 90 minute wait. Safe to say I will not be coming to this "dump" again< /Text>

Chris was so sweet with my daughter. He kept her anxiety at bay by telling her what was about to happen and made her feel comfortable. Also, Dr. Khasru was very informative in educating her on fear that she broke a tooth when in fact she just has an adult molar growing in place.</Text>

I’ve been coming to this office for some years now and I can honestly say I love it here. From the front office Sylvia, Angie, Nilvia, Iraiz and Veronica to the back office Christin, Nikki and Viridiana. They are all so sweet and genuinely caring. They are always in communication with my mom and I as she also has been there for years and we both appreciate them so much! Thanks Banning team for all you do for your patients.</Text>

We got to the office early today and Sylivia was kind enough and able to check us in before our apt. Kaitlyn was gentle with Addys cleaning and Keren did an awesome job with my daughter's sealants. They made sure everything was througho and good. And both doctors, Dr. Jameel & Dr. Khasru are just wonderful.

I was trying to make the trip fun and Light, and Dr Khasru made it so much more easier on me. He was very friendly and gentle with my boy and even let him sit on top of me so that he won't be anxious or nervous. Because of his patience, my son was able to be cooperative and let the Doctor take xray pics and 3D pictures as well. My little boy had a very good experience in this place!

We got to the office early today and Sylivia was kind enough and able to check us in before our apt. Kaitlyn was gentle with Addys cleaning and Keren did an awesome job with my daughter's sealants. They made sure everything was througho and good. And both doctors, Dr. Jameel & Dr. Khasru are just wonderful.

<review>Not going to say names, for that's the only respect I can give them at this point. They pressured my friend into having me and her boyfriend called to the backroom just so we rate them. On our way home, her mouth started bleeding due to them failing to file down the wires that were worked on her braces. Thankfully they fixed it right away when we got back, so there's a minor redeeming quality.<//review><resp>{'time': 1566926868574, 'text': 'Jakob, we are happy to hear your experience was to your expectations.

Very unprofessional. Not organized sitting for hours with an appointment. People go in for cleanings and for the orthodontist to change rubber bands and tie in braces and then leaves home for the day and patients go home with a wire Because the doctor left home EARLY.  How can you have a schedule an appointment for your braces and cleaning and for them to tell you it's OK to be without your wire for 2 to 3 days because the doctor left. The staff does not know how to talk to patients professionally and when they do they tried to con them into getting something that they don't want, when you hear a  patient say no  Stop talking and making them uncomfortable.<//text>

Viri and Dr. Kllasru were amazing. You can tell they care about their patients. My daughter is terribly scared of dentist and Viru and him are super gentle and understanding with her. They’re extremely patient and professional. My daughter doesn’t want anyone else touching her teeth but these two!<//Text>

Dr Jandali is amazing! She is patient, kind and very loving to my Granddaughter. My granddaughter had to have a couple teeth pulled and was very scared. She is 6 years old and Dr Jandali and her assistant Cinthia were patient and explained what they were going to do and she did great. Today we had to have spacers put in and once again they did a great job! I would highly recommend Dr Jandali!</text>

I came in as a walk in and I understand that there were patients before me so I did have to wait a while. The receptionist, Angie, and the dental assistant, Viri, were really nice and helpful. Angie gave me some pain killers to try to help with my pain and even put me down as an emergency visit. Viri came and checked on me and kept me updated while the doctor was finishing up another patient. Christian was very comforting and kept a smile on my face as i waited. I really don't like going to the dentist and since this was my first time in a while, I'm glad I came here. I got what I was expecting to have done. My only issue was having to wait almost 2 hours to finally be seen.</text></record>

<text>Specialist my ass. Thank you W.D.- Banning,  Ca. whom ever was nice enough to finally helping my poor husband out with his very painful 45 year old baby tooth. Thank you so much for pulling that damn thing out, and not making him wait longer. He's been dealing with the tooth being infected for about 2 1/2 week's.  That caused him to be dizzy all the time, headaches and vomiting from time to time. Plus being a diabetic made things worse for him, then for others. Unlike the other W.D. and one other denisit group, you made him a priority today, unlike the others. Thank you so much,  as his wife the worried went away.

<Text>I hadn't been to see a dentist in 17 years.   I dont have a particular reason- just never had any pain.  But with that said, All people that are afraid of the dentist should have gone with me today.  I had 2 appointments today.  From the moment I walked in I was helped by some very beautiful young ladies and seated. I was called to meet the ortho and a young- also beautiful woman began to prep me and answered any and all questions I had.   I met the ortho surgeon who was male and also very nice. ( My teeth are drifting apart and I was concerned I would have rotten teeth, unusable for braces  It had been 17 years afterall.)  I was given a good examination by somebody with knowledge. I was deemed good for braces.  I have no money so it's for the future.
My 2nd appt was for a cleaning- I really feared bad news from the dentist.  I was called 10 min after my prior appt. I had x rays done and had to bite on plastic which wasn't so bad I just have a small gag reflex with the plastic throwaway sleeve they cover the biting part with.  The gorgeous young lady that took the xrays was also extremely helpful in any of the Q&A I had.  I was moved to a different room where they would actually do the cleaning.  I met the dentist-  This guy was middle aged and cracking jokes.  He is awesome.  I feared his news after a young woman(also beautiful) came and took different pictures of my teeth and.. dried them.  The dentist saw me and had me open wide, he searched for cavities and other complications and found none- which is awesome! Yay Me!  After sooo long of not seeing a dentist I really didnt expect that.  I try to take care of my teeth but I dont floss.  It was now time for my cleaning.  I think I am like everyone when I say having power tools in your mouth can be quite scary.  But, BUT- they've made leaps and bounds in dentistry since 17 years ago.  The tools are very small and not very noisy.  I braced for some sort of pain while they turned on the tool and started cleaning- there was none.  The most awkward anything was the sensation of the tool doing its job in front and behind my teeth.  My dentist finished cleaning , cracked some more jokes and ran off to some other beautiful smile to help.  A young woman chatted with me while finishing with flouride and asked me to rate them and so I am here!  These guys kick ass, All of em! Everyone that I spoke to or had questions with was genuinely professional,  pleasant, and courteous. ... and beautiful.

I understand that wait times could be different and that you may need more than just a cleaning.  In my experience when you find a good place filled with heartfelt, wonderful people,- it normally stays that way.  This Western Dental has it in spades and I recommend any and all to go and check em out.

Sorry to all at Western Dental in Banning I am extremely horrible with names.  You guys keep kickin ass, I'll see you guys soon :)<//Text>< pictures>

Horrible customer service with girls at front end. Wanted me to continue payments for something I had already paid off. The wait was extremely long. Didn't get the warm feeling that would make one want to return and when I pointed out I wasn't pleased about their service it was "oh okay"</Review>

The staff are not friendly.  They triple book appointments and make patients wait for a very long time.   They split x-rays, exams and cleanings into 3 appts and each one takes from 1.5-2 hours.  All 3 things could be accomplished start to finish in 1.5 hours,  NOT 3 sessions totaling 4-6 hours.  On top of all that,  the staff purposely try to upsell services and don't mention that these services (i.e. white filings versus silver) are NOT COVERED under insurance.  They make it seem like these services are completely medically necessary (antibiotic cleansing,  fluoride sealants), don't inform you of covered options, etc.  and my husband walked away with a $600 bill!! I realized what they were doing at my appt and point blank asked them if those recommendations were covered under insurance at which point they stalled and tried to talk around a straight answer. They're in it only for the profit and we're NEVER going back.  We switched dentists.</Text>

<text>Very long wait time and poor job.  Went in to get my temporary crown replaced and waited 1 hour and 30 minutes to get in.  I could tell the dental assistance was getting stress out when she couldn't get my bite to even out each time she was fitting my temporary crown on.  So she did what she could and stated it may need to be replace or remade in my next proceedure.  Sure enough it fell right off the next day.  My next problem was, the periodontist wasn't available for a month, so that meant I had to drive out of town to meet him at a different location if I want to get my dental work done faster.  After I've got my dental bill contract situated, they schedule my next appointment and I left home.  Days later western dental called me and told me they wanted to confirm if I had any future appointments with them because they didn't have anything in their system for me, which I thought was very unorganized and careless of them, but because they gave me a card with my next appointment date, time, and locatiom, I was able to update that for them over the phone.

So I drove out of town to meet the periodontist a couple weeks later.  The lady working at the front desk checked me in and made me fill out a new application, and afterwards stated that because they are although it's the same company, they are a different location and due to policy they don't share or transferred pt information.  Then she proceeds to tell me I have to pay an extra $130 out of pocket because I've used up all my insurance allowance at the previous office visit.  I was frustrated because I've already establish my dental bill that would include all my procedure.  It was my understanding that all I need to do was follow up with my appointments.  So after I disagree, a few phone calls were made by western dental and the office finally agree to let me see the periodontist as scheduled.  My appointment was suppose to be at 11 am, instead they pushed it back to 230pm that day, and when I showed up on time, I waited another hour to get seen for a 15 minute proceedure.

As of right now I really want to switch companies because of the bad services I recieved.  I have one more procedure and I hope it goes smoothly. I know I said alot, but it's important for people to know the the kind of service they're paying for and I wouldn't recommend western dental to my family.</text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1471286532216, 'text': 'Hello Tchaa,\n\nThank you for taking the time to provide us with feedback about your recent experience.\xa0We are sorry to hear that you were unhappy with your wait time.\xa0Please know that we are making every effort to improve upon longer wait times, and we understand how frustrating it can be.

<text>This place is a joke, I’m supposed to be on vacation but I had to come in because one of my molars started to hurt. Since I got here they took about an hour just to sign me in, and about another 2 hours before I was even seen. They put me in the back room and just forgot about me. Other patients who had later appointments came in and were out in no time. If I could give no stars on here I would.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80db415e8bda4dad:0xf75038a4173a0cc</Gmap_id>< date>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Don't waste your time with this place. That is exactly what happens here, they waste their time because many people quote for a while but they cannot see everyone. My son had an appointment at 4:30, orita is 5:45 and they still haven't called him. I wouldn't be so mad if this didn't happen almost every time I come. And since his brakes are under contract, I can't go anywhere else. My daughter continues to put on the brakes and not even free to come to this place.
Don't waste your time coming here. That is exactly what will happen, your time will be wasted. My son's appointment was at 4:30, it's now 5:45 and hasn't been seen yet. It wouldn't be so bad if this didn't happen almost every time we come here. They overbook ALL the time. I'm just so sick of my time being wasted. I had something else scheduled after this and had to cancel because they don't respect peoples' time here. I've wanted to write a review so many times. I have had so many negative experiences here, but I'm an optimist and always want to give people / establishments another chance. I wish I could change my son's orthodontist but can't because we're under contract. My daughter is next to get braces and they couldn't pay me to bring her here. Just don't waste your time.

No pierdan el tiempo con este lugar. Eso es exactamente lo que pasa aqui, pierden el tiempo porque citan muchas personas para un tiempo pero no pueden ver a todos. Mi hijo tenia una cita a las 4:30, orita son las 5:45 y todavía no lo han llamado. No me enfadara tanto si esto no pasara casi cada vez que vengo. Y como sus frenos estan bajo contrato no puedo ir a ningun otro lugar. Mi hija sigue en ponerse los frenos y ni gratis viniera a este lugar.
