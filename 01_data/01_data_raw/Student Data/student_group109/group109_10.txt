Though sometimes busy, it's a very clean place and has pretty much every type of equipment you'd want in a gym.< /review>

<Text>This was my gym for years. Unfortunately due to the fact there is no rule against video chatting in the restroom/lockeroom.  My mother and I will not be returning. Manners and privacy are required during this age where your phone can do almost anything except give you class enough not to video chat in a Locke room full of women changing. Your next sign should read. No video allowed in the locker rooms.< /Text></record>

Staff is friendly and very tentative.The Equipment is clean. Its not too crowded and parking is not a problem. There are lots of machines to choose from and the indoor pool stays warm for the kiddos. Its just a nice environment all the way around and the people there are not rude. I give this place 5 stars. I got signed up there by a rep by the name of Monica and she took the time to show me around and explain what memberships they had. I of course got the membership thats gets me in all the in shapes so yes i would definitely recommend the In-Shape located in Quail Lakes. Oh I forgot to mention they have plugins to charge your phone and that's a plus. I can't have my phone dying while working out.</review>

<Text>Sadly have to say I had a bad experience here I pay for my husband and I to go to the gym and with our memberships I also included towel service and access to all gyms mind you my home gym is Pershing so this was my very first time coming. The second we came in the door and scanned our phones  for some reason the man at the front said there was a problem then proceed to take a call and talk to another staff next to him just goofing off and by the time he's done at least 10 people already came in then he says your good to go so my husband and I already frustrated and confused of why he had us wait if it was ok ask the man for a towel he then says it not on my husband's membership only mine but we have the same account after 5 minutes he then says oh my bad I see it there sorry and tell his co-worker very rudely give them a towel then my husband and I go to the locker rooms and meet back up and we both said the same thing the place was so unkept there where dirty towels everywhere, no toilet paper truly not a good experience and AC wasn't on so the place stunk definitely not going back</Text>< pics>

<Review>This place is enormous. Just the 1st floor alone is pretty big, and there's a 2nd floor as well. Indoor pool, 4 raquet ball courts, a big parquet floor (that's mirror walled), dumbbells and plates in at least 2 different rooms, same for cables, TRX, outdoor jungle gym and bodyweight stations, and metric tons of cardio machines. I'm missing some amenities but hopefully you get the idea.</Review><time>1556655742627</time>< pictures>

<review>Unfortunately I had a very bad experience with the personal training program. I paid for a PT package only to have my personal trainer no call no show and I did not receive a cancelled session from in-shape staff. And to top it off I was promised a refund from the manager that was not fulfilled. Also the store manager Sobe does not return phone calls.<//review>< Name>

I'M DISAPPOINTED AGAIN. THE LADIES STEAM ROOM IS A JOKE. THERE IS NO STEAM. DIRTY AND SMELLS LIKE MOLD. I LEFT WITH A BAD TASTE IN MY MOUTH. SO I ALWAYS ASK WHEN.I COME IN IF THE SAUNA IS ON SO I CAN GO IN AFTER WORKING OUT BUT THE SAUNA IS NEVER ON. NOTE: ALL OF THE IN SHAPE STEAM ROOMS ARE DIRTY AND NEVER WORK PROPERLY. I WILL NOT BE RENEWING MY MEMBERSHIP AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND GOING TO ANY IN SHAPE CLUBS. I LEAVE FEELING FRUSTRATED. I ONLY GIVE IT 2 STARS BECAUSE THE TREADMILL AND BIKE WORK.</Text>

<review>I lived here for almost 3 years during my studies at UCLA. It was a great experience and super supportive of my financial condition. My favorite part of the co-op is to wake up with a hot breakfast and end a tiring school day with a good dinner. No matter how busy I am with my school work, I never have to worry about feeding myself. The variety of food is also good, you are expecting different food every day. Some of them are amazingly delicious.
While working for 4 hours a week seems a lot, it is not that bad. I worked as a kitchen chief for a while and it did cultivate my managing and communication skills with people.
People are also really nice. I came here as a non-native speaker and make lots of friends and at the same time build up my language skills. Whenever I need something urgent (such as batteries or light bulbs), there are always people that help me out.

In conclusion, this is a great place if you are a more outgoing person that can give up your privacy a bit. I do love this place and I like the communal living atmosphere a lot. However, if you think privacy is an important issue this place might not be a good place for you.

The photos are from several different rooms I've lived in for the years and the omelet for brunch every weekend :)< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-OrUI98Z1JOWaWPvO5c0t1JFKatD8IVvwYEsa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOaGKBJVXxIpQtZuHauwJyyTkwEg31lLWUTRFK8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCd9zw_fGNLCuSrILfwLsQM5lKmIl3cgsum1T4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1WKbCmW0cpygKjDtmDgEUErPWCIBDYXkZWL3s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I would highly recommend living here if you're interested in cooperative living. Very unique to live in a place that you partly own democratically. It's so nice to see people put effort into the community just to benefit each other. Shout out to dessert crew making amazing desserts from around the world!< /Review>< Pics>

I love this place so much. Elsewhere in LA, it is like pulling teeth to make friends and be part of a community, especially during the pandemic times. Here, not only did I find myself in an established mini-world with a rich history and culture, but I was also able to take advantage of the low rent and an amazing meal plan. Doing the chore shifts becomes second nature after a while, and is a great opportunity to connect with more people in this little bubble. The co-op really inspired me to get out of my shell and feel accepted. It's a great place for students of all ages!</Text>

<Text>I've been living at UCHA for a quarter now, and I love it. I've gotten to meet a ton of cool people even during Covid because we work together on chore shifts and stuff. It's really cool to be part of a cooperative - it feels like we're all in this together. One of the best things about UCHA is that it's one of if not the, cheapest housing options in Westwood and this is partly because of the chore shifts that everyone is required to do. Again though, this aspect of the co-op highlights one of the other incredible things about it, that you get to meet a large range of people who you will live and work with throughout your time at the co-op. If you are looking for a cheap housing option that comes with meals (19 a week), a community, and ways to engage, then this is the place for you!<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEScX1rXHyh940Qn1Sb-Yxj8H5QvaUDaShH6PM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

<review>Disregard complaints about the management of this place; the co-op is a lot better run these days than it was a couple of years ago.

Sure, the facilities maybe a bit old and all, but it's still the best place to live around UCLA for a student—and not just because it's cheap. Here you have a community of great people from around the world. This is a place where many have found companions, friends, mentors, and more who will be with them for the rest of their lives. No one is alone at the co-op!< /review><user_name>刘鸿韬<//user_name>< pictures>

< review>
Living here is awesome! It is so close to UCLA and it really nice coming back to food cooked for you everyday. The rent is really cheap, my room came fully furnished with a brand new bed, dresser and desk. The entire place has been going through building renovations and my room was really nice with a beautiful view overlooking UCLA, Los Angeles & Santa Monica. The staff is really nice and supportive of my studies. I have met so many kids from around the world here. Every week we have to contribute 4 hours, I did mine in the kitchen. It was really fun learning to cook dishes and the chefs help you. The negative reviews are misleading. It's really simple and straightforward cheap living. If you do your 4 hours a week and keep your area/ room clean then its a great place. If you are lazy and don't then they put a fine on your account. The staff is just doing their job making sure everything is clean and nice. I highly recommend checking this place out if you are on a budget. I also met students that went to Cal States and Santa Monica College.<//review>

Lived here for about a year. Awesome place and a great community! It's probably the best place in Westwood if you're not looking to pay an arm and a leg. You sign up on a quarterly basis which is amazing if you're looking to go abroad a quarter (you won't have to deal with finding a subletter, etc.) You get 19 meals per week but you're expected to do your job/chore 4 hours a week. The job is not bad and for what you get (19 meals/living in a fun community/parties/patio area/a little store in the co-op/cheap rent); it's a fantastic arrangement. The co-op also has a rich history (one of the first desegregated student housing communities in the nation/it offered refuge for Japanese-American students that faced discrimination during World War II) Also, it's nonprofit so I really don't think it would be possible to get a better deal. It's fun. It's weird. It's the co-op.</Text>

<Review>I was planning to live here for one quarter or two; I ended up staying for four years, and still contribute my time to this organization even after moving out. This student housing is perfect for international students and UCLA students who do not want to get screwed by the high college living cost, especially in Westwood( it provides Food, Utilities & more). Members get to meet lifelong friends & colleagues from all around the globe and they contribute their time to make this place better. This organization definitely gets better over the years. A lot of the bad reviews are from student who lived here a decade ago. I believe that my opinion is not an exception, because I have met many members along the way that shares the same opinion as mine.
If you are thinking of living here; be aware that this is more of a dorm and not apartments, you are living on the Frat Row (there will be noise on party nights, but some Coop buildings are quieter than others), don't be picky with food, be social (if you are more mature than the average college student, it might be hard to fit in and get along with people), you are responsible for doing your chores.
Unfortunately, the people who complains about this organization usually are members who are picky about food, people/culture, living style, & get into trouble because they do not pay rent on time, nor do their chores, etc. Members are paying for what they are getting, I don't know why people are expecting some Luxury Apartments when they are paying this cheap rent!
Overall, I am extremely grateful for this amazing & unique housing organization.</Review>< Rate>

<review>Best place to live! The people are amazing, you build a community through the everyday interactions. There's so much diversity!! Extremely affordable. The negative reviews are just people who are ungrateful to the resources the co op has to offer.<//review><Date>1536221305983<//Date><gmap_id>0x80c2bc8fe7998a91:0xff1f8f594ed98d8c<//gmap_id>< name>

< review>
Cheaper housing option for UCLA students, where members need to work  ~4 hours per week for their shifts (kitchen, facilities etc.). People staying here are mostly international students, which makes Coop culturally diverse, unique and more fun.</review>

Im at a loss of words for the atrocities that take place at the eye of the political storm that washes over the ucha coop. the memcom which is formed from "fellow" students gives said students thee ability to eject one from their current housing this would be good if the bored was not swayed by personal vendettas<//text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I was thinking of renting a room here, but I read the comments and I am scared, also your page does not allow to know the payment method, apparent scam !!!

I love Dr. Jett and his staff, it is always a great experience and I don’t feel like I’m just a number. I am always greeted with smiles and friendly conversation. I love that feeling of being treated like a person and not a patient. I highly recommend Dr. Jett and to anyone and everyone that is in need of his specialty.</text>

I had gum surgery here. The office staff is very friendly. Dr. Scott is a wonderful doctor, he explained the process to me as I was having surgery done. Staff asked me what music I would like played as I went through surgery. In fact I should have went to Kaiser to have surgery done cost wise, but I felt very comfortable with Dr. Scott so I stayed here. I suggest you see Dr. Scott if you ever need work done. I will come back to him if ever I need to. Thanks Dr. Scott and staff.<//text>

<text>Gum surgery can be very intimidating to get into, the team at Dr. Jett's practice is knowledgeable yet down-to-earth, and provides superb care.

Dr Jett and his staff are super nice and put my mind to ease right away. I had a gum graft done and even though I have hypersensitivity, it wasn't nearly as painful as I had anticipated. Dr Jett was very gentle and quick too! I'd advise anyone who needs periodontal work done to go to Dr. Jett and his awesome staff.<//text>

Fantastic office the absolutely best Dental surgeon. Dr Jett and his team took personal interest in each step of my implant. I needed to be seen initially within a week because of a sheared tooth before a 10 day out of state trip. Not only was I seen, he took care of the broken tooth Set up a care plan and started the 9 month process for the implant. I never felt any discomfort and am here for my last visit today. I highly recommend him.< /Text>

Their enthusiasm is contagious, definitely sets the mood for a good day! Everything went wonderfully, they're a spectacular team and are extremely knowledgeable.

I am new to Fresno and relied on my dentist at Willow Dental for a referral. I am so thankful I was referred to Dr. Jett.  From the moment you walk into his beautiful office, you are greeted by Shannon at the front desk. His front office staff sets the tone.  Shannon was so warm, welcoming and kind.  She fixed me a cup of coffee and made feel at ease.  I was beyond nervous and scared.  I was brought back to the room by the hygienist Ashley and she was just as warm and kind.  Ashley explained what the course of my visit would entail in great detail.  Then, Dr. Jett walked in... and the magic started.  I admired that he started the visit by asking personal questions to get to know me.  We immediately clicked.  He was very professional, comforting and made feel confident that I was in the right place.  Not once he made me feel ashamed or embarrassed for the reason of my visit.  I left his office feeling better and confident he will take good care of me and get me back on the right track.  Do not hesitate coming to see him.  He is wonderful.  I did not take any pictures because I was so terrified of my visit.  But I will next time I see him.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1579546797313, 'text': 'Wow Nancy!

Had my first visit with Dr. Jett today.  It was by far one of the most positive and memorable (in a good way!) dental experiences I've had.  His staff was beyond professional, and the process of registering as a new patient was easy and efficient.  The quote for my pending procedure was very straightforward and helpful.  He provided great feedback and education for how to keep my teeth and gums healthy.  Highly recommend!<//text>

<Text>Dr. Jett performed the pinhole gum graft surgery on all 4 quadrants in my mouth.  Everything went really well!  He has an awesome staff with upbeat personalities, he lets you choose your music during the procedure, and everything was done in 2 hours.  I would definitely be a repeat customer if needed in the future.<//Text>< pics>

It was my first office visit and I received a warm welcome once I came through the door. The office and staff were so nice, I felt super comfortable. Dr. Jett was extremely insightful and thorough. I really appreciated the time he took to explain things to me throughout my visit. Everyone is kind and provided excellent customer service! Thank you!< /Text>

IF...I could only have Dr. Jett as my everything doctor (primary, surgeon, dentist, GI, labs, you get the picture) I would be beyond blessed! He’s funny, caring, thorough, very gentle and talked me through the entire procedure because I turned into a big baby at 50+ 🤷🏽‍♀️! Ohhhhh wait, plus he has a love for photography and providing dental care to other countries - Dr. Jett’s Ministry! 🙌🏾

Staff gave me the warmest welcome when I arrived, friendly, very relaxing, super clean! Ms. Chanel, I love her! She stayed with me during each office visit, played my favorite artist and topped it off with a nice warm blanket that almost put me to sleep!

I give Dr. Jett and his staff a 10! So if you’re ever in need of some serious dental work, PLEASE...take the referral! I promise you won’t be disappointed! xoxo

< review>
I had laser surgery on my gums in January. It was a very pleasant experience.
Dr. Jett made me feel very comfortable and his staff is amazing. I had no pain
whatsoever. He also made an adjustment to my bite which had been a very
serious problem for 2 years since I had a tooth extracted. I had been to my dentist,
and two doctors wondering why my ear, jaw and head were aching to the extent that I couldn't eat any thing that was chewy or hard. When he noticed I couldn't open my
mouth very wide at all he adjusted my bite and changed my life in about 20 seconds.

Recently I went to his office again for a cleaning with his hygenist Ashley. She
too, was amazing. I am not the best dental patient because of past experiences.
Everyone in his office is very patient and understanding and helpful.
My only wish is that I could go to them for all my dental work.< /review>

<Review>It would be difficult to find anything negative to say about Doctor Jett and his office.  I have never had to wait to see him, he explains everything to my satisfaction, and he is careful to keep the procedures as pain-free as possible.  The staff are very friendly, and I have actually been known to come a bit early so that I can have a cup of coffee from a machine that grinds and brews it in the waiting room.  I highly recommend Doctor Jett.< /Review>< Pics>

After a long and tedious journey (14 years prior) of retainers and orthodontics, I had never thought it possible that this would all end thanks to Periodontist, Dr. Scott R. Jett with the assistance of his well-organized and friendly staff. His techniques are thorough and well-thought out toward the needs of each individual and are technologically advanced as well as up-to-date in scientifically proven techniques. Thanks to Dr. Jett, a new beautiful and real smile is shining in the world.< /text>

<Review>I've had two separate surgeries with Dr Jett and if I ever have to get more I would choose him and his staff every time. Shannon is so friendly and helpful and I love working with them. Dr Jett is very personable and professional. I hate dental work and he always makes me comfortable when I have to get a procedure done. Would definitely recommend!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Dr. Jett and his staff are amazing!  I had a gum graft with absolutely no pain or issues.  My son, who is a dentist, warned me about how uncomfortable the recovery from such a procedure would be.  I had zero discomfort in the days and weeks following the graft.  The office staff and assistants are a joy to visit and Dr. Jett is a great guy too!<//review>

I enjoyed all parts of my visit with Dr. Jett.  His staff is inviting, the office is beautiful, and Dr. Jett is very informed and up to date with his specialty.  He was very gentle fixing my tissue recession and the results have lasted with no issues.  I would recommend Dr. Jett to any of my friends and family.</Text>

He has great but simple techniquesand products to care for the gum which has saved me from surgical intervention going into 2nd year now. The standard of care provided is also higher than what I expect. My dental hygienist is also great, always care about temp of water that works for me, facilitates what I need, I never had problem with pain or increased sensitivity after cleaning. The front office staff is so helpful and so nice. Service is also quick, in and out, but with high quality. Thank you so much<//Text>< Pics>

I have had a tooth extraction and a dental implant done with Dr. Jett. The staff are consistently friendly, helpful and efficient. Dr. Jett has an excellent bedside manner.

Dr. Jett and his staff are nothing short of amazing! I was a bit nervous about my procedure (implant), and Dr. Jett and his staff made me comfortable throughout the process. Dr. Jett's work is impeccable. I HIGHLY recommend him if you find yourself in need of an implant/implants.<//Text>

I can’t express enough how grateful I am to Dr. Jett,  I’ve been a RDA for over 4 years and in my work experience I’ve learned that he’s the best at what he does. It was no question that I refer my mom to Dr. Jett  when she needed extensive treatment. My mom has severe anxiety of dentist and any type of dental work and she was worried that no one would be able to help her, but all her worries went away by her First initial exam. She felt very comfortable and welcomed and not embarrassed of everything she had going on because Dr. Jett ensured her of that. Today was the first day of her treatment and she did so well and is so happy to start this journey to a healthier smile. Thank you again Dr. Jett and staff for doing quality work and quality care.</Text>

I can't say enough good things about Dr. Jett and his staff. Over the past year I have had 3 gum procedures and my husband had a dental implant. From the moment you walk into the door, you are treated like one of the family. Dr. Jett's chairside manner is exceptional. He takes the time to talk to you and explain the procedure and expectations clearly and at a level you can understand. His office staff are extremely friendly and of course they serve Starbucks!!! I would highly recommend Dr. Jett!< /review>

Dr. Jett and his staff are amazing. Dr. Jett and his assistant Mindy hooked me up with the best care. I am not the best person to work on when it comes to being in the dentist chair, never been a big fan of the dentist, always been real stressed about it. But coming to Dr. Jett changed that. Very little pain after my procedure. I like that he talks to you and lets you know what's going on while he's working. Two thumbs up for Dr. Jett and his crew, for sure!!! 👍👍< /Review>

Dr. Jett is very friendly and confident in what he does. He is so knowlegable and puts you at ease. He answered all my questions about my dental treatment, and was very professional. I felt like he did his best to lay out all my options and gave me his honest opinions on what was the best treatment for me, short and long term.

I appreciated not having to wait too long to be seen and they are very organized.  With their professionalism and Dr. Jett's patient and gentle manner, this was the best experience I've had at a dental office.  Highly recommend.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x8094680ba9729b9f:0x15608779bf3c145c</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>What a superb and kind group of rescuers at TAPS. Our beautiful rescue dog Dempsey has been so cared for by the truly nurturing Bonnie, who has answered so many of our questions. If you're concerned their fees are a little high - don't be. They cover vital surgeries and vets' trips during the fostering, and ensure you are comfortable with the pet as well as the pet being happy with you. They really do want the best outcome for the saved animal. This small organization relies on donations: they don't have the facilities of a large shelter - and we were alerted all along to the costs. We are SO glad Dempsey found us through TAPS. And we would wholeheartedly recommend them to others - especially seeing how shelters often find an animal's new owner through lottery. Not here: it's true care. Thank you!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I adopted my doggo in 2014. Porter was one of 9 puppies that were 5 weeks old! The mother dog was on site so I asked to meet her. I climbed into the x-pen and observed the puppies for about an hour until I settled on "Dallas". He was playful and also fell asleep a lot. LOL

They were nice enough to meet me halfway to drive Porter to me since I live in San Diego. I appreciate that they send out a person to do a home inspection; that will ensure that puppies/dogs are placed in a safe environment. Porter is now 5 years old, healthy and happy!</text><Gmap_id>0x80c2957ee2d29c21:0xa3755ef9d5f9ca23<//Gmap_id><user_name>Lisa Turney<//user_name><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBp6N8NPhhkZO4XVvNu5dBaTU21OXxc2WWV-q4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKTPN1YS_8zBA49PpZQmS-pnKYR18DfxJrr7Cw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjSMSNwHRxeoIrzsjogRkUKmFUeJyry2bNdMdX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMF7Jof6_UDdov6kxYFLA8meVlOrga4c3J3h-Q-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMocddxDNjIQ7K1iC53nKHz7dLukhotAi2uhtQX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMuAugLSesAHK8EoZeIstyv9qpB1XsK5iSuGyP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtQtTSID7dSRpqSfjx89jK1735nx5H5Dgv1jSO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdBtGEfhzunSDUgvc8nvuGY9OkhxmHecmH4gfr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Time>

<Review>They understood that we needed an older dog, not a puppy.  We are first time pet  owners and they communicated with us to find the right dog.   Really appreciate the fact they they were still available to ask questions especially, as stated before, we are first time pet owners.  I assume the service will be even better when COVID-19 Safe at home order is over.<//Review>< pics>

I adopted a sweet little kitty from TAPS. Everyone was wonderful to work with, and I can tell they love animals and want them to have the best homes possible. The pets at TAPS are vaccinated, microchipped, spayed/neutered, and in happy and healthy condition. Dedicated volunteers help find them homes. If I had room for more cats I would come back!!!< /Text>

First I want to say everyone was extremely friendly and helpful when we had issues arise after adoption, and second that we love our dog. They also referred us to a trainer after the first one failed and we really liked his methods and they’ve helped a lot. But I feel wronged and can’t go without mentioning the not so positive parts of our experience.

We adopted our dog 1 year ago. We were told he was about a year old, and that he was a stray captured by the pound. We had to pay a relative premium for such a “young” dog. We knew he hadn’t had any formal training yet, and that we’d have to take him to classes which we were fine with, assuming nothing was too engrained after just a year. We were not told, however, he has a heart murmur and would be severely limited in exercise. After we specifically requested a dog that would be capable of longer hikes. Not the end of the world, frankly. What was more challenging, is after we received his paperwork from the shelter, there was a note that he was owner surrendered and was listed as 4 yrs old! That by itself is not so bad, BUT he had ZERO training, and he has severe anxiety about other dogs (we noted we live next door to a dog park and he would be frequently near other dogs). We’re realistic people and we know this all can’t possibly be vetted (pun intended) prior to adoption, but all of these issues stacked together, along with paying a premium for a dog they had documented as being 3 yrs older really has not sit well with me, especially with the few hundred dollars in vet bills to treat a heart murmur that’s existed his whole life.

I would not necessarily recommend against adopting here, but after seeing some other stories and having our own experience, I would definitely say to be cautious and thorough when considering a pet here.<//review>

{'time': 1568840549998, 'text': 'David thank you for complimenting staff and volunteers and acknowledging that we are there for our adopters even after the adoption is finalized.  In the concerns that you raised, I think there must be a mistake because I just re-checked the paperwork from the shelter medical staff and it says "heart/lungs sound good" and it also notes a DOB (date of birth) as 8/25/17, which would make him just about 1 year old when you adopted him on 9/6/18.  We aren\'t sure which paperwork you are referring to, but we would love the opportunity to review it with you.  Thank you for being so devoted to this dog and for believing in the mission of adopting an orphaned animal.'}</resp>

Laurie and the entire team at TAPS and Operation Adopt were simply wonderful to work with! When we found our girl online and fell in love, they worked with us quickly and professionally to unite us as a family. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to help give an animal a second chance and a happy home. Thank you, TAPS, for making our lives so much better!<//Text>

Wonderful Animal Rescue group!  Super local, and you can meet the animals any time they are open instead of having to apply sight unseen like so many places!  The place is clean and nice, and the animals are well cared for!  Plus you can tell how much they care about each and every one!</review>

<Response>{'time': 1553868206514, 'text': "Kelley thank you for recognizing the importance of having a physical location for people to meet animals for adoption.  So many people want to adopt but can't bring themselves to enter a shelter - it is just too emotionally upsetting.  Operation Adopt is able to help match orphaned shelter animals with these people in a calm setting.  We are proud of how clean we keep the facility - it keeps the animals healthy and lets people meet them in a pleasant environment."}</Response></record></dataset><record>

<text>Aside from being wildly over-priced, my biggest concern was that the owner's son didn't like the dogs barking so he would tell at them and spray them in the face with water while they were caged. If you can't handle dogs barking, don't work at a pet rescue. This person seemed untrained and inexperienced in humane animal care. If he did that in front of me, what was going on behind closed doors? It wasn't a good sign. There is another worker there who was very kind and gentle with the animals. It seems these rescues are running a bit of a racket: $700 for a dog? Hm. I love the pup I rescued from the rescue, but I wish the staff was required to have proper training. For that much $$$ they can afford it.

UPDATE: I was mistaken that it was the owner who I had initially talked to (it was a volunteer's son, not the owner's). The owners just called me and said they would correct the problem and speak with the seasonal worker who was spraying the dogs. They sound genuinely concerned. So if you go visit, hopefully things will be different. It sounds like they are open to requiring actual training by any staff working with the animals. Hope so!
The dog I brought home does not seem traumatized or mistreated. He loves people and is friendly and wonderful.<//text><username>Stanya Kahn< /username>< time>

<response>{'time': 1549986476155, 'text': "Stanya, thank you for taking time to address your concerns.  The Animal Protectorates is a nonprofit animal welfare organization so there are no owners - but staff and a generous group of volunteers who give freely of their time.  Your review deals with 2 separate items - adoption fees (which you feel are too high) and how you may have perceived treatment of the animals at the center.\n\nDuring our conversation, I explained that the reason Operation Adopt is different than other small rescue groups who are home-based or who conduct pop-up adoption events on the weekends is that we have a physical facility.  Running a business like Operation Adopt includes staffing, insurance, rent, worker's comp, utilities, supplies, collars, leashes, harnesses, food, vaccinations, etc.... After our conversation I believe that you understood why the adoption fees are different - they help offset the cost of running the center along with our generous and supportive donors.\n\nI was not physically present during the time you describe an incident occurring.  What I can tell you, however, is that over 1200 dogs and cats have been adopted through Operation Adopt and that we care for our animals so much that we are still one of the very few organizations in Los Angeles that still require a home visit prior to placing an animal in a home because we want to make sure their new home is a safe and fit environment for them.\n\nYour concerns were heard and if there was any corrective action needed, it was addressed.  Thank you for adopting an orphaned animal from Operation Adopt and we hope to hear how things are going over the years you have with your new family member because we like keeping in touch over the animals that we have rescued from shelters and devoted time and love to."}<//response>< Rate>

TAPS changed our lives! My husband and I were looking to rescue a dog, but were overwhelmed with the idea of wandering into a shelter. Then we found TAPS. They rescue dogs, they make sure all the dogs and spayed/neutered, chipped, and loved by their volunteers.  We got the sweetest little girl from them and 10 months later we went back and adopted her sister too! We are one big happy family! Thank you TAPS!!!! What a fantastic operation.<//text>

<Review>TAPS is great! They made the process very easy and I like that they do an in-home visit before allowing an adoption. We are very grateful to TAPS for our awesome fur babies!!  They are the sweetest kitties. We renamed them from Ethan to Yejin (meaning precious in Korean) and from Joel to Minho (meaning brave & heroic, also in Korean).< /Review>< Pictures>

Had the absolute best experience here and couldn't be happier.  My partner and I initially came in to meet a dog we found on Petfinder; when we arrived, that dog was no longer available - however, as soon as another dog became available that Laurie thought would be a good fit for us, she called us -- and it turned out be our DREAM DOG!!  All in all, I don't think we could have adopted a dog had it not been for TAPS; TAPS allowed us the time to make an informed decision that would be right for all of us.  Thanks TAPS, and thanks Laurie!!! :)</Review>

{'time': 1522683940675, 'text': "Jeremy, we are so glad that your daughter found a kitten.  Pets enrich the lives of people and her getting to grow up care for an animal is wonderful.  We are not exactly sure when you came into Operation Adopt since this review was just written (and we haven't had kittens in quite a while), but nonetheless we are hoping that giving you the reason why we don't allow everyone coming in to hold kittens (or puppies) helps you understand.  We don't allow people to hold them without an application on file for a few reasons.  First, everyone coming in would want to hold them and given that we are a pet adoption center with a large number of animals instead of just a pet supply store like the place you mentioned, we give first priority to people with applications on file because going through the process shows us that people are serious about adopting - not just holding animals - which helps our staff and volunteers know where to focus (because it they had to let everyone hold animals, they wouldn't have time to dedicate tho their primary role of caring for the animals).  Secondly, and most importantly, diseases spread by touch, and young animals are extremely vulnerable.  Let's say for instance someone was looking for a puppy or kitten and had been visiting local shelters and holding multiple animals - and one of those animals had a disease.  Diseases in shelters are sometimes fatal and many are contagious not only to other animals, but humans as well.  So, by allowing anyone coming in to touch or hold animals, we are putting our animals and people at risk.  This is another reason we require people to sanitize their hands prior to interacting with our animals.  We are sure the kitten you adopted is healthy and disease free, but hope you understand that we take a lot of precautions to care for our animals and humans coming into contact with them."}<//resp>
<Review>I took my daughter in to look for a kitten to pair with the other kitten we had adopted a couple of months ago from a store.  They had several kittens in there but they wouldn't allow us to even touch an animal till we filled out an application.  Why spend the time filling out paperwork only to hold an animal that may not like us?  So instead the next day we went to Burbank Pet Plaza where they had a cat adoption.  My daughter found a kitten she loved and we took her home that day.  And the kitten was under $100, neutered, chipped and vaxxed.<//Review><Rating>1<//Rating>< Date>

I have heard and read that this group goes to city shelters and outbids perfectly fine potential adopters rather than rescuing pets that truly NEED rescue. If so, this helps no one and breaks hearts of potential adopters kind enough to go to high-kill city shelters. I would not adopt from them.</Text>

<rating>1</rating><review>Found the perfect cat to which I wanted to adopt. I’ve been looking for a year or so. I applied and talked with one of their employees about our (my partner’s and I’s) situation of going back to college after the summer. She said that it didn’t sound like a problem to her and that we sounded like very capable parents to a new cat. I called this morning to discuss my application since I never received an email confirmation—their application continually would auto-correct my name, so the email was probably messed up. The person who I talked to on the phone was RUDE. She treated me with no respect and questioned my financial means to care for an animal. (I work while at  school and both my partner’s and I’s family are fairly well off.) We have plenty of time and commitment to an animal and would have provided a safe, loving space for the cat to live for many years to come. I also have raised animals—cattle, horses, swine, chickens, dogs, and cats—since I was in grade school. I was ready to finally find an animal for my own home.

< Review>
The people at this place are exceptionally nice and seem to take very good care of the pets. I’m giving  one star because their model doesn’t serve any purpose other than satisfying some pretty troubling elitist attitudes regarding shelters and removing “highly adoptable” dogs from qualified middle and low income adopters. Hear me out.

Based on my visit to their store and information on their website, TAPS selects dogs that have a high probability of adoption, i.e., very cute, young dogs and puppies. I didn’t see a single pit bull though it’s possible they have selected some in the past. After adoption from the shelter, TAPS relocates the animal to a spacious and swanky store located in a very popular and very expensive district in Burbank. Once there, the staff sets the dog up for re-adoption the and adds a hefty premium: we’re taking around $700. For reference, the fee for the same neutered and microchipped dog at the shelter is around $95 or less.

Here’s why this is problematic. Although TAPS claims its methodology “frees up shelter space,” it logically would have a minimal effect in achieving that end, given that the dogs they select are the most likely to be adopted, and fastest adopted at the shelter. Moreover, they are intercepting the animals from potential forever homes just for placement in a self-described halfway house. As a representative from TAPS has admitted in a comment to a previous review, they have even adopted animals who already had potential permanent adopters lined up! These methods perpetuate the problem it claims to be solving. So obviously “freeing up space” or finding forever homes is not their primary goal.

The inflated adoption fee doesn’t seem to add up either. The shelter staff explained to me that the fee covers surgeries, microchipping, food, and lease payments for the Burbank boutique. Assuming the dogs are neutered/spayed and microchipped at the shelter and are eating moderately priced dog food, the vast majority of their adoption fee is going to their lease. The dogs there seemed healthy, and when I asked about the one dog who seemed to
need surgery, the staff insisted that the issue was cosmetic and would not be covered by the adoption fee. Note: my current dog had the same “cosmetic” issue that later caused her recurring injuries and warranted surgery. Providing needed medical care doesn’t seem to be the primary goal either.

So, that leaves us with one other remaining goal of TAPS, which is to provide an alternative for “people who find the shelter experience emotionally upsetting.” Okay so first of all I don’t know a single person who fits that description. With the exception of those with PTSD, this is not an issue for most  people. If you’re unwilling to rescue a dog because you find the shelter experience that unbearable, you probably shouldn’t have a dog no less have a nonprofit dedicated to your “struggle.” Second, if that is your main goal, get a less expensive boutique to house your adoptable animals so you can make the adoption fee accessible to more income levels and place more animals. You can still bring the dogs to popular areas with lots of foot traffic. The shelters do it all the time.

Finally, the most irksome issue with this place is how class (and race if you want to get deeper) are implicated in its mission. The organization, located in an affluent, mostly white part of LA, skims the shelters, located in the lower-income areas to take the best dogs away from low and middle income community members and potential forever homes so that they can be placed in a temporary shelter and adopted at an inaccessible fee by those with much greater means. Coupled with their aversion to the shelter experience, which perhaps requires a trek into a “dirtier” and less white area, it’s hard to not feel the subtle undertones of classism (and perhaps racism).

In short, don’t feel good about yourself if you adopt here.</Review>

<response>{'time': 1522461801250, 'text': 'Katelyn, it may help you to have background on how Operation Adopt came into existence.  For years, The Animal Protectorates worked on "puppy mill" legislation to stop pet stores in Burbank, California from selling animals coming from commercial breeding facilities.  The alternative business model is to help rehome animals coming from shelters, humane societies or qualified rescue organizations in the same space.  Consumers visiting pet stores selling the commercially bred animals were spending thousands of dollars on purebred animals, having no idea where they were coming from.  We are really excited that these same consumers are finding joy in adopting orphaned animals coming from shelters.  Their mindsets are changing from thinking shelter animals are inferior to making a shelter animal a part of their family.  You are correct that adoption fees at Operation Adopt are higher than they are at a shelter.  This is because there are no subsidies from local agencies to offset the rent, staff salaries (we have to have staff to care for the animals), workers comp insurance, utilities, vet bills, and everything else that comes along with running a pet adoption center.  The perceived value of shelter animals are increasing in peoples minds (and hearts) because we are bringing them into a clean environment where meeting them is easy and supportive.  We also conduct home visits on every adoption to try to insure that these animals lives are headed in a better direction than where they came from (most of the animals we receive are neglected, some matted to the point of not being able to walk comfortably and many have medical issues requiring immediate and continuing vet care to get them to the point they are ready for adoption).  Sometimes though, even our rigorously vetted adopters have circumstances change in their lives that prevent them from keeping their pet.  Our guarantee is that in those circumstances we will receive their animal back and once again try to rehome the animal so that the animal will never enter the shelter again (our Purple Collar Promise to the animal).  So, our mission to that end has a positive impact on reducing the strain on shelters.\nWe hope knowing some more background will give you a different perception.  Thank you for visiting and for your compliment about the staff (we think they are pretty awesome too) and the good care we give the animals while they are with us.  We don\'t take your review as negative, on the contrary, we think all reviews are positive because they help us grow as the most unique adoption center in the country.'}<//response>< user_name>

We were informed by the shelter that Moira originally came in as a stray, then was adopted and returned by the person just adopting her(reflected as OWNER SUR RETURN) on her shelter records.   The shelter estimated her age as being born in 2005, likely because they thought her blindness was due to age (but after spending nearly $1000 at an eye specialist to try to have sight restored in at least one eye, we learned this was likely a condition since birth).  Our age estimate was taken from several vets who saw her as well as our assessment of her activity level - all of which we shared with you.  It is impossible to know a shelter animals exact date of birth.  We do the best we can.\n\nPrior to your adopting Moira, we gave you the veterinarians information who had been treating her for bladder leakage and urged you to contact them.  We told you she needed to be on medication for life and gave you the price estimate for it - the foster also provided you with a month's supply.  After having Moira in your home for a few days, you decided she was not the right dog for you.  We offered you a credit of the adoption fee towards another dog which you refused.\n\nThere are many other inaccuracies in your review and I fear that trying to address them all here will lead to more comments from you - none of which are productive to what we do - try to save animals from the shelters - which since opening just over a year ago we have done just that with nearly 450 happy families.\n\nOn a really great note, we would like to let you know that Moira was adopted into a lovely home where they think she is terrific.  We hope you find the perfect furry family member to enrich your life and bring you happiness."}< /response>

A few months ago I was on the hunt to find a companion. After searching high and low I found the cutest dog on PetFinder from this rescue and decided to send an email to get more information. I wanted to do the four day foster but Shelley (the owner) denied that. I moved forward and adopted my blind dog Moira however, I had to sign the contract before I ever got to see the records. After having my dog for a day I started noticing that she was panting a lot and sometimes even shaking and this was when we would just be laying on the couch. After finally receiving the records I was livid! The record showed that my dog was ten almost eleven years old BUT online they had her as a five year old puppy! I completely understand that rescues never know an exact age but come on! Cutting down half of an animals age is completely unacceptable! I decided to try not to let that get to me as she was such a sweet animal so I kept her for awhile. The first weekend that I had her I tried to go on a walk and after a short ten minutes she was coughing and breathing so hard that I had to rush her in the house. I was afraid she had sniffed something bad but once she got in and was able to lay down she was fine. So the next day I took her on the same walk and the same thing happened after ten minutes. That is when I realized she was too old and unfortunately I would need to give her back. I sent Shelley an email and she called me one morning and I can honestly tell you Shelley is the most UNPROFESSIONAL person to run a business that I have ran into so far. She was so rude and was cutting me off as I was trying to explain myself and talked to me like I was a child. She then yelled and told me I could bring the dog back and get my money back. The next weekend I took the dog back and Shelley refused to give me my money back stating she had a signed contract which she is right she does however, she LIED about the age of the dog and also had me sign the contract before she sent me the records! Such SHADY business. I decided not to cause a scene at her store so I went home and sent her a very serious email. After going back and forth with me she eventually told me she would discuss this in her next board meeting on Oct 11th and get back to me but the next day I received a call from a lady, Laurie, claiming to be a part of the board but I have yet to find proof of that and she advised they would give me half of my money back IF I signed a nondisclosure agreement. Again SHADY!!! I had them send me the nondisclosure and after review it was completely ridiculous. It states their side with the contract attached but does not state that they LIED about the age. I let Laurie know I would only sign this IF I could add in my part and attach the records but of course they denied that. Shelley stated that they have some vets who stated the dog was eight and another six however they have NO proof that she is five and not to mention the vet records that show she was ten is the shelter that the owner surrendered her too and it has an exact date of birth! I am posting this and will continue to post and warn people and report my experience to the BBB so NO one makes the same mistake I did. Do Not let your excitement get the best of you or trust them because their store is clean or that they do home check ins. Do ALL research and ask for the records BEFORE signing anything. Shelley is an attorney and knows ways around how to scheme and manipulate. OH and not to mention Moira is posted back on PetFinder as five years old which is completely false due to the fact that she will be eleven in two months on December 30th as she was born in 2005. This situation for me was SHADY and a complete FRAUD and Shelley should be ashamed that she lied and then had the nerve to make it seem like I was the issue.
*In response to Shelley's comment, the eye care receipt I received showed they paid $234 for eye care. I kept Moira for a total of 3 weeks. Also, the prescription is NOT the issue, her LYING is! Be careful when adopting here!*< /text><rate>1</rate>< pictures>

Nice facility, well maintained. Extremely secure area, as it is patrolled by Sheriff's deputies. All legal matter needs can be addressed in this building. Central North County location. Easily accessible from nearby streets and freeways. Plenty of parking and easy in and out avenues.<//text>

Relatively easy parking, good judges, and it's not overcrowded. Court hearings in civil departments typically start when they're scheduled. Unfortunately, small claims and unlawful detainer cases all got transferred downtown. There also needs to be an additional courtroom handling civil harassment cases. It's odd to review a court because they're not supposed to be competitive. Still, I'm glad North County has high reviews, at least for now.< /Review>< Pics>

Free parking and access to the courts! What a concept. The unlawful detainer (eviction) clinic was very helpful. Unfortunately you must go downtown to file an unlawful detainer.< /Text>

Victor performed an excellent, thorough and very quick turnaround inspection and report on a residential property we are purchasing. He was very kind, courteous, professional and knowledgeable. He took time to explain his findings and answer all my questions. We would highly recommend At Home Inspections and our wonderful realtor, Mike Dunn, who made this great referral.</review>

<Review>We purchased the Basic Home Inspection for a home on which we recently made a cash offer. We were able to schedule the inspection only 3 days after calling. At Home Inspections was was very responsive--they answered the phone every time we phoned, even on the weekend. Emails were promptly returned. The inspector was on time, courteous and professional. The inspection appears to be well done and thorough. The online report was available to us just a couple of hours after the inspection. Overall, we are very pleased with our experience and recommend their services.</Review>< Pics>

<text>The At Home Inspections team was professional from start to finish. As a first-time home buyer, it was extremely important that I was not only a part of the inspection process, but that the inspectors were very thorough, knowledgeable, patient and friendly. Renny and Bradley were all of these. At Home Inspections was the right choice for me and my family. I would recommend At Home Inspections to anyone looking for a first-rate home inspection company.</text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Review>At Home Inspection’s is our preferred Home Inspection Company here at The Ryan Dobbs Team. They have conducted multiple inspections for my team, myself, and all of my clients. In doing so they have always supplied the most quality service without a doubt. They are responsive, thorough, and have years of experience in the business. From their Scheduling Department to the Inspectors themselves, At Home Inspection’s always gets the job done. 👍🏻</Review>< pics>

Wasn't able to be at the inspection due to scheduling but the inspector appeared to have been thorough. Was sent photos and videos with explanations. Found many faults with the property that I otherwise wouldn't have noticed and found somethings that made getting the premium package worth it, such as foundation and plumbing issues. Can't really comment on the price as I'm unaware of how the market is but I would definitely say I'm happy I hired them.< /review>

We hired At Home Inspections to inspect a 12 unit apartment building for us. Veronica was very professional and fast to accommodate our schedule. He communication is great.  Jamie and Tristan came out on inspection day and were very thorough.  In all it was nice to work with this company and we will be using them for future property inspections on buildings we're buying.<//Text>

Jamie and his team are the best in the biz! I have worked with a lot of local home inspection companies and At Home Inspections has always stood out as the best. I highly recommend them to all of our clients needing a home inspection because of the value and their customer service. They get out there quick, do a VERY thorough inspection, and will go over the inspection with our clients and answer any questions.  Anyone needing a home inspection company would be making a great decision going with these guys!</Text>

As Always, At Home came through like a rockstar!  It was a ridiculously hot day and they were dripping in sweat, but you wouldn't have known that by how professional and thorough they were.  They traveled to Rosamond for me and my client, and we were truly grateful.  The car problems they had on the way there didn't deter the job they knew needed to get done.  Professional, friendly, experienced and understandable.  My client needed things explained multiple times in many different way, and they helped her feel like an expert when they finished.  :-)  Highly recommend them and their services.</review>

Mr. Jamie Trammell is amazing at what he does. He explains very well to the clients and is very thorough both in his inspection and when talking to the buyers.
I usually don’t recommend services because of liability purposes but I definitely recommend Mr. Trammell. I look forward to working with him again soon.
I almost forgot to mention the office lady I spoke to was very kind. She tried her best to accommodate our need and schedule.
Thank you!!!</review>

< Review>
The inspector that came to inspect our new home missed glaringly obvious problems. We paid extra for pool inspection - there was a crack in the cartridges and the drain plug was leaking. She was lazy and refused to clean off the water meter to check it. Instead, she sent us pictures of leaves on top of it. The inspector missed rust in microwave at the top of it. She missed a high pitched squeal in the fill valves for our toilets. All of three fill valves needed to be replaced. The plumber actually told us that we should call the inspector and get our money back. Which is why I did. We have had a total of $800 worth of home warranty claims within the first month of owning our home. That isn't including the pool. They have given us a total of $50 after three weeks of sending them information about all of the things that were missed. She also stated in her report that she did not go on the roof. We are told that her body cam did show her on the roof but that there were parts she couldn't access, supposedly. We have a one-story roof, so. Regardless, I was skeptical from the findings in the house already but we missed the opportunity to make a concrete decision on whether or not we wanted the house, as well as asking the previous owners to pay for repairs. This was shoddy, lazy work. Flat out. Im glad we have a great warranty.

The only reason I gave them two stars is because the person I talked to was very nice.< /Review>

Love it! Helpful staff & great products make this a must stop for your kitchen needs. They carry Corningware, Corelle, Pryex, Lodge, & many more trusted, made in the USA brands. It's nice to be able to replace a lid to a Pyrex container or the pan you've loved & used for years, when you don't need a whole new set. Have fun!</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Great selection of kitchenware, especially items to hold and store food. The prices here are comparable to what you will find online, but you don't have to worry about shipping prices. They also have in store specials where you can buy specially discounted items after meeting a minimum purchase amount. The manager was super helpful and answered every question I have. I would recommend to just about anyone with a kitchen and dining room table to check this spot out< /Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
My ex-wife loved shopping at Gilroy Premium Outlets – me not so much. Corningware Corelle & More was one of the few stores I enjoyed. I love cooking with CorningWare® and Corelle makes the best plates, cups, saucers, etc., IMHO. You can drop a Corelle product and it never beaks.<//Review>

Lots of kitchen gadgets so if you have time wander around the entire store, and you will find stuff you can't live without, or ask the staff if you can't find something or want to know if they carry it and you don't  have time to browse.</text>

< Review>
We ordered the cheese pizza and mozzarella sticks. The pizza had a thin crust, which is just the way I like it. The slices are large, so you might be full after eating just one. We had the rest of the pizza for lunch the next day, and tasted good after re-heating. The meal was a good value.<//Review>

<review>The shrimp and gorgonzola pizza was amazing! I think my husband got the herb chicken potato and that was good too. The crust on the shrimp pizza seemed thinner than on the chicken which made it somewhat difficult to eat. But it was so good i didn't mind getting a little messy. The small is actually quite big so we could've shared one but we wanted to try more than one item on the menu. To top it off, the prices are ridiculously reasonable! Seriously, pizza hut is more expensive and this is place is 10x better in terms of quality<//review><gmap_id>0x80c2bb181fc6481f:0x8969cf0bf1399c74<//gmap_id>< username>

Great food! Their sandwiches are my lunch time go-to. Good sized portions with a great side salad. This hole in the wall restaurant is a Santa Monica gem.</Review>

<Review>My family is truly happy we found this place after living here for 9 years...better late than never. The pizza has a delicious classic crust. The cheese is good quality unlike waxy cheeses elsewhere so if you love papa johns or dominoes, stay away.  The sauce is just right and also has classic taste. Toppings offered is probably the biggest plus. Huge selection! Nowhere else can you get potatoes which tastes absolutely amazing with sun dried tomatoes and garlic. They mince garlic just right that it melts away in your mouth. Delivery is always fast and at $0.99 delivery fee...how can you beat that?

Negative comments seem to be with those ordering or dealing with store via telephone. I’ve ordered online approx 6-7 times in 3 months and I haven’t had an issue. Take a chance and try a few different variations and order at different times. I noticed sometimes late at night pizza is rushed so it may not be as well done (as in the bake) compared to ordering earlier but still no complaints here.

Keep up the great work!< /Review>< user_id>

I'm a regular orderer here.  Good food, good portions, and reasonably priced.
The pizza is good.  The chicken pesto sandwich is great.</Review>

<username>Erik Stouffer</username><Review>Some of the best pizza I've ever had. Cheap. Great pasta, five stars, not enough noodles but plenty of chicken. Really nice salads with great dressings. They make the dough themselves. Deserves to make it big, hopefully they'll stay humble though if they do : )< /Review>< pics>

How does this have 4 stars? Literally any other pizza is better. Papa johns, dominos, whatever else shows up in the search results will be better< /review>

The pizza has no flavor, literally.
It's like eating a pizza immediately after leaving the dentist office.
I tried their spaghetti it was bland and overcooked. Somewhat reminiscent of spaghetti-o's.
I would prefer a pizza pocket (as horrible as they are) over their pizza.
And a Cup-o- Noodles would be two steps above their spaghetti.
P.S.
The only reason I even gave them 2 stars is because the counter girl was very attractive.< /Text>

<text>I pass by this pozza place every single day on my way to take my school bus back to the yard, I always say I'm going to stop amd try it out but there's never any parking to park my bus. So today I had craving for pizza and said I'm going to stop amd get a slice. I was lucky enough to find a park, so I went inside and ordered 2 slices of chicken with green bell peppers and red onions, and a slice of pepperoni and a slice of chicken and bacon for my friend. The lady at the counter was very friendly and the place looked clean. It didnt take long to get my order which was a plus cause I didn't want to get caught up in too much traffic. But when I got on my bus I tasted a slice and let me just tell you it was soooo good! The pozza was so light and was not over powered with cheese I didn't feel heavy after eating the slice either. One of the best pizzas I've ever had! When I got back to the bus yard I gave my friend her pizza which was still hot after being in traffic for over an hour! She tasted the pizza and said omg this pizza is bomb! Lol. Thanks for the amazing pizza! I would definitely take that drive to get this amazing pizza!</text></record>

🤢 First my boyfriend and I tried a slice of the pizza we ordered it tasted so terrible that we couldn't eat it. Next we tried the spaghetti with meatballs, it was so disgusting that we were afraid it would be considered animal cruelty if we gave it to the dog. Next we decided to have the tiramisu, unfortunately the tiramisu they gave us was still partially frozen. Instead of having a nice relaxing meal together, we ended up cooking an entirely new dinner together. As a result our plans for a relaxing evening together didn't go as planned, and we didn't have time to go out to the movies together. This is an awful place that can't even make food that has a tolerable taste to it. 🤢< /Text>

Nice decor, spacious, clean.  Servers were friendly and attentive.  The quality of the meat was good. Seasoning and flavors were good on all the dishes we tried. We had boneless wings, dohkbokki, bulgogi tacos and calamari. Only complaint was the chicken didn’t have a lot of sauce on them. Server corrected it promptly.  Would go back again.</Text>

Came here to have a snack and try their Korean chicken.  Food was very tasty and the place is very clean.  The servers r very friendly and take immediate action if there is something wrong.  The only complaint I have is that the radish was a bit bland and overly sweet.  They have numerous locations all over the US and world.  Maybe Korean fried chicken domination will happen sooner than we expect;0  Next time I am in the area, I would definitely want to try other food from the menu.< /Text>

Double fried chicken is one of life's pleasures! :) Bonchon's KFC is crispy and moist, not heavily breaded and dry as a lot of fried chicken I've tried lately. And if you like spicy, the spicy is truly spicy, not overly so though, so don't be discouraged. I like to have both the spicy and soy garlic combination, so we can get the best of both worlds.

We've tried other food here as well, the seasoned fries (get it), the Japchae (meh), and the tacos (just okay). I would stick with the fries and the KFC.  The kimchi side is very small for the price so I wouldn't order it again. A Medium portion is good for two people if you want to take some leftovers home.

I've also pre-ordered here for a party and they had it ready for pick up at the appointed time. Parking in this lot can get tricky when during peak time but there's plenty of street parking on Hays St. We will definitely be back here.</Text>

< Review>
Loved the spicy fried chicken wings. Although, if you get other flavors like we did(soy garlic), you should eat it first. The spiciness over powered the soy garlic. We also tried the fried shrimp shumai and it was good.<//Review>

<text>I'm a fan of Korean fried chicken and saw this was close to the San Leandro BART station. I was very hungry, so when I saw the lunch specials I figured it wouldn't be enough. So I ordered a small combo with half soy garlic and half spicy. They warn you on the menu that your food might take time (30 mins) since it's usually cooked to order. I also ordered a banana milk (I thought it'd be home made but it's in a carton) and seasoned fries. The seasoned fries were seasoned perfectly and cooked well. When my chicken order came out, I was surprised at how large the pieces were. They're much larger than Kentucky Fried Chicken. I had to double check I ordered a small because it was enough to feed two people. Everything tasted great, including the side of daikon. I will definitely recommend this place to others who like Korean fried chicken.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzZhlntEDTtNeuK4gWDNiXiCEU6Hqtsgjw7fyP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6dwwxec3stY0pN0BEwEOlhaXXq0GJ8EkTMvYg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics></record></dataset><record>

<review>I used to work at a Bonchon location for awhile and this ain't it. Each piece of chicken should be painted upon order to avoid getting soggy but when we opened it in the car it was already very soggy. My guess is they double cook and paint the chicken in batches then throw it under a heat lamp for awhile. The boneless wings didn't look like your stereotype boneless wings at all  and despite there being 12 instead of 10 you aren't getting your money's worth of meat in comparison to the strips and other choices. Prices were marked up very high without options for modifications. Alcohol is purchasable to go and staff is nice.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

How hard is it to follow directions.. Geniuses.  Called and ask for chicken to be done well done arrives has a gross taste. I wanted a refund. Owner and apparently the guy who works there are screening my phone calls(I called after the owner stated I should call he's never there very convincing). Way to go customer service and why does the chicken taste like chemicals when you bite into the chicken it's a nasty dry taste. Def bad. I'm done with eating from this place. Awful food<//text>

<text>COVID TAKEOUT REVIEW

Phoned in order, they said 30-45 minutes. Got there to a 10 person line out the door (most were deliver drivers). Finally got in to check in (40 min after order is placed). They say to wait another 15-20 minutes. After 20 minutes went back in to check on my order & nobody could tell anyone how long any orders would be. They said it was up to the kitchen how long it would take. 😒 After 1 AND A HALF HOURS our small order of chicken was finally ready. We pay & leave... eating on the drive home AND ITS COLD!! The chicken strip were cooked BEYOND DRY & SAUCELESS. Please don't waste your money!

Food delivery drivers were even walking away & declining orders because it was taking too long.<//text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I've been to this place multiple times, and both the chicken and rice is excellent. However, earlier today I ordered 15 drumsticks and chicken house rice which was a total of $52.00. Once I arrived at home, my wife counted only 8 drumsticks, so I made multiple attempts to call them and let them know they're 7 pieces short of what I paid for. No one answered so I drove back to the restaurant. As I explained the situation to the cashier, he walked to the back and then another guy approached me. The other guy told me that he was the owner and he prep the food himself and that this was the one chance he'll give me as if I was lying about my order. I told him to check the camera and that nobody's perfect, people do make mistakes and errors. He responded with the words I don't have time to look at the camera. He walked to the back and the cashier returned with an apology and gave me the correct order. I will return but the owner in San Leandro was rude and in so many words excused me of lying when he could of just check the camera and admit he was wrong.</Review>

This was my first time ever doing hot pot and honestly it was okay the customer service was horrible I kept trying to get a waiter to come help me and they just kept ignoring me it's kind of weird because although you order with one person you don't have your own waitress or waiter everybody who has his apron on can help you which was confusing because you tell one person you want your food one way and then they bring it out and it's another person who bring it out and then you can like know it's wrong and I know you like yeah I ordered this and they like No And so for that it was horrible for the customer service definitely far as the food it was actually good I got the Creole broth so if you go try it it's good I got shrimp corn do not eat them crab balls I'm crab balls is not what you think they are that was horrible in my mouth but I will go again and I will try to ask them can I have the same waiter or waitress because trying to flag down a waitress or waiter is horrible<//Review>

!The chicken is a good staple food. However it was over fried and didn't have the soy garlic flavor that was had at other Bonchon.  Very friendly staff though!!!<//text>

<text>I love Bonchon. This location's fried batter was thicker than the usual bonchon fried chicken but it was still very good. It is part of a shopping plaza nearby Safeway Petco and other stores, so it's super safe and there was a ton of parking right in front of the store<//text><pics>None<//pics>< user_id>

In the front for 10 minutes before anyone spoke to me.  It seems like all the servers are young boys who are afraid to talk to anyone and have no customer service skills.  How many times can you walk by a person without asking if they’ve been helped yet?  Anyone who walks in should be greeted as welcome customers.  The customers shouldn’t have to prompt the staff on what to do.  Not impressed.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I will not come back to this place again.  I.lpace the order online and call to confirm my order and the guy told me that it will be reDyh in 25 minutes.  I arrive and guess what , my order was not reewady and he told me to wait for another 24 minutes.  This is ridiculous  services. He could have told me that it will be ready in 45 minutes when he was on the  phone.  Now i am waiting outside in the car for some chicken that I hope is not dry like last time.  I will not come back even it is free.   Need some professional help and better services and sad thing is that they are not even busy.  Ruin my whole dinner plan on a Sunday night.<//Text>

Food was just ok and took a really long time to come out. Servers didn’t know what was going on most of the time. Definitely not worth a 2nd visit.< /Review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The fried chicken is very dry, and it tastes good by the Korean seasoning. The taste is good, but the fried chicken is really fast. In addition, there are a lot of take-out orders in the store. Please wait for more than half an hour for meals, whether it is a dine or a take-away.
Conclusion: It is also a store with too many food quality instability. I also recommend Berkeley downtown for the same name.

炸鸡炸得非常干，全靠韩式调味料做出来的味道，味道是好的，可是炸鸡真的炸得都快焦了。另外店里面有很多外卖order，不管是堂食还是带走请预备半小时以上的等餐时间。
结论：又是一间数量太多食品质量不稳定的店，同样名字的店我个人推荐Berkeley downtown的<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Very unpalatable, won't come again. The meat of the barbecue stone pot rice is not so fresh and smelly. Fried chicken outside flour is super thick

Now i know every one who shops at this place has their own experience with their own gripes, with that said  i have my own story to tell. It is all about customer service. Forget about the stuff they carry . We all know it a gamble from the start so good or bad that part is all on us.
Back to customer service this place is top notch in helping me out in a situation that most places would push back with what i claimed to have taken place  have in mind i had proof for what i said what happened and not even one bit of backlash the assistent  manager the tall guy wish I knew his name he always there  when I'm there shopping . He was the nicest person  took care of my problem  not even try to push back  on the spot I was satisfied and happy to be a loyal patron of this liquidator .
Thanks Bulldogs for all you do

This place is absolutely terrible to shop in. I checked the website on my computer at home to determine if there was something there I wanted to buy. I found a generator and tried to call about the availability however no one answers the phone. So I decided to go and see the place. Of course the generator that was advertised on their website is not available. I talked to one of the associates and ask him if he had an inventory listing of the products they have on hand. He told me no they do not and they do not log items into the computer as they come in. The bottom line they do not know what they have in the store you just have to go there and roam around until you find something you like. I would rate this place as a POS.

until today I would have given this place for stars but the pricing system has been redone and it does not work paying $200 for something that cost $300 brand new not knowing if it even works does not seem like a good deal to me too many times previously have I gotten something home excited to play with it only to find that an essential piece is missing or it just flat out doesn't work but at the price that cost in the end it was always worth it because I could bye many things and usually the Lost per gain was worth it not always but often enough I found myself paying typically $300 per trip and now they want $300 per item almost I strongly recommend finding a coupon online and purchasing your item brand new opposed to coming here and playing Russian roulette with your money< /text>

Messy, extremely overpriced, broken, dirty, disgusting merchandise. There's no way their prices are "discounted". I compared and half the stuff they're selling prices similarly OR LESS on Amazon or at Walmart/Target. If you're looking for lower prices, there's better priced and cleaner/nicer/newer stuff on Craigslist. Extremely disappointed, no need to visit again.< /Text>

You dont go to a walmart or target and have the very same employees hoarding merchandise for themselves.

Bulldog!! I used to go every other day to this place, since 2017, buying stuff and getting good deals sometimes broken items that at the end Bulldog’s was exchanging with no hesitation. Now June 2019, the staff treat you like they don’t need from you, they treat you like you’re there to ask for a favor instead of recognize you give them a check for their families, for example some cashiers have been so impolite; you have to like them and be like their close friend to give a good deal or good service!  Now they don’t want any returned merchandise, they will tell you, not to return anything at all, because they are giving you a good deal already, I didn’t agree to this and now those guys do all possible to make my shopping experience a nightmare suddenly telling you Back Off!! when trying to get products, only a few other employees will give a real customer service and have been helpful and know the importance of serving you as customer..Bulldog! Customers are always First, and always agree to us, is one of the rules for a successful business.. Still taking this matter to the appropriate owners, so much stuff in my possession that is broken and can’t just do nothing about it, California laws are clear, money back or exchange products..and the most important, do not discriminate against for race or ethnicity..I don’t hide,  this is my Real account I’m a profesional and educated by the best Mentors in USA, I know 100% what is to serve a customer.. Bulldog you must train your people to respect, provide value, and learn how to Serve customers! 🔟❌💪🏼👊🏼</Review>

<text>Varying selection of goods that are way cheaper than retail. I have started to save a good amount of money because I now shop here regularly. You have to go consistently to keep up with the new product they get.<//text>< Date>

<text>A year or two ago I would have given them 5 stars but for the last year my experiences have been very unimpressive and worse.  Their merchandise has been really second rate and their prices have gone up dramatically.  On the rare occasion I find something I want it almost always is cheaper online in new condition compared to torn, dented and stained condition at BullDog.   A fair amount of their stock comes from items which don't sell on Amazon by FBA (third party) sellers who ask Amazon to "destroy" their merchandise to avoid inventory fees.  I do agree that their employees are very pleasant.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><name>Eric Splaver<//name></record>

Found s craphy softbox photog kit! Wait for it......25$ the soft box alone is that much. Led light pad for my artist friend 10$ and white corner shelf ez install 5$. I always find things I didnt know I needed until i come here. Come here first if you are small business on budget... remodeling on budget... replacement on budget....just come here first.< /Review>

<date>1531714422022< /date><user>115058016940046003266</user><text>First time buyer at this location. Let me start of by saying , good customer service. Before the store opened and while I was waiting outside I spoke to a few customers about what type of pallet have they bought and their experience. They all told me the same thing. Its all TRASH ! I should of listen to them but I took my chances and literally that's what I got . I can't believe what I found in the pallet, empty Gatorade bottles, empty boxes and some with trash in them, random left over stuff from other things and most of the stuff was either broken or missing parts. It was a big disappointment knowing that I got ripped off. If the store doesn't have the merchandise to fill a pallet don't throw trash in it and rip people off. I don't recommend this place at all and I would never waste my time going there again.< /text>< Resp>

Great place for what it was!! Nice exhibits, various attractions (stingray bay, petting zoo, feed giraffes, etc) and food prices were reasonable at the cafe.  First time taking the kids; had a season pass for kids and I.  A lot bigger than what it looks like on the outside. We all enjoyed our time. We have yet to feed the giraffes and finish the African Adventure (which was pretty impressive). Will definitely be back!!<//Review>

Grab your Camera it's A great day at the zoo. All of the great animals a zoo should have but not the crazy crowds of the big city zoos. Feeding the giraffes are a quick fun thing all age kids and kid like adults can do. Make sure to see the bird show. You will be amazed how close they fly over the heads of the audience. Be sure to take the little ones to see the dinosaurs. Who doesn't wonder what it was like when  these animals roamed the earth.
Bring a picnic or eat just a few feet away from what looks like African tundra. Too many other areas to mention so get a pass and go as often as you like. You will see something new every time. Pro tip get the parking pass and use it here and at its fullest at the Shinzen Friendship Garden over and over again.</review>

This place was great!!! Very nice and cheap fun for the kiddos. Can bring your own water and snacks in. Also 2 food courts which are still fairly cheap to have a nice lunch in the park.< /text>

Come see the baby rhinoceros! The Fresno Zoo has made a lot of improvements since I moved here over 20 years ago. When I first moved to Fresno I took my wife and kids to the Fresno Zoo. It was a traumatic experience. The animals were kept in horrendous conditions. We never went back. Today was our first time back. I was very impressed with the new exhibits that are much, much larger and more humane. I would go back again.</text>

You can feed giraffe, touch the stingray, and real rhinos walk like they are cool in their habitat! Amazing feelings! We’ve spend there almost 3 hours, zoo is HUGE! Memories for entire life guaranteed 👍</Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< date>

<Text>Best zoo I’ve been to! Really clean, the animals are very well taken care of, and the staff is very knowledgeable. On top of all that the prices are very reasonable from the admission to the food and even the souvenirs were affordable. The food was very good for a zoo and even though there is a lot of construction I can’t wait to see all the new exhibits they are making and it does not take away from the experience.<//Text><time>1615170205564</time><Response>None< /Response><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtEBLSEnB2y2rc6W8ruAWXs1I5b7DriU9bP0QV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLTQTHBitd2WEsq2eHAodQb84HthKsD5OGmE_Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODHLCJa5V83p7nZpPL7ChnrOZUAtSzv6sEPFKG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMOkTvhZSRIyVF6zSYI3uw_MrQnU1EenDkHZHT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFhRATC3mYZDRzMa7CWRy9-MMa1I-t6f9JNRw-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMONm9GEpGvupa35bnVB7Qnl_FS8qEpCclHSmw9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Name>Sue Evans</Name><rate>5< /rate><GmapID>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6< /GmapID></record>

<Review>I just love the Fresno Chaffee Zoo. I have been going since I was a little girl. I really enjoy all the new attractions they are have installed. I plan on going this year.  We just went to the zoo this week. It was wonderful and we enjoyed ourselves and we were able to stroll at our leisure and there was plenty of shade to enjoy all that is offered. Can’t wait to visit the Kingdom of Asia when it’s open.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>Nice zoo worth to visit! You can see so many special creatures, different while having the similarities, hinting there is a Creator behind all these.

Bathrooms could have used some tidying up. Not many drink stations, or areas to cool down. I’d recommend going using cooler months. Would like more animal interactions. It was easy to purchase tickets online and avoid the long line.<//review>< rate>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>Ample parking, do come prepared to pay $5 to access the park in which zoo is included. This is separate from the fee to access the zoo.
At the time of my visit there was much construction underway. I look forward to visiting the new exhibits when they are completed. I enjoyed the exhibits currently open, especially those I could walk through as with the birds. I loved that the exhibits are designed for the animals to roam or fly, with beautiful landscaping and ample water features.
I'm not a fan of children, so very glad I was able to purchase my ticket online for when the park opens at 9am and the hot, tired shrieking truly got started. Clean and strategically placed restrooms always a bonus.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6< /gmapID></record>

<Text>I Came to the zoo with a 9 and11 year old. We were at the zoo for about three hours.  The kids were bored and all in our group disappointed.
The zoo could easily improve its customer satisfaction. We really had no idea how to explore the zoo. Here is an idea:  as soon as you enter the facility have a spot separated by fences for about 10 to15 separate zoo walks each exploring a different highlights of the zoo. The tour would start/finish at the same place. The finishing tour group would then line up for a different tour. In a period of two to three hours most of the zoo would have been seen.
These tours would be covered by the entrance fee. Don’t charge another fee. You could let each tour leader accept tips.
As it’s set up now, I will never return to your zoo.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

This Zoo never fails to amuse our family. We get season passes every year and we go almost every week. It's such a great experience to get out of the city for a while and just be around amazing animals. Our kids love love the petting zoo. We figure it's cheaper to buy a zoo pass and have them enjoy this experience than try and get a pet. Lol but overall great place to visit<//review>

Love all the new changes to the zoo and they haven't stopped. Working on an all new Asian area with hippo and more. It is so peaceful and relaxing there. Had a great dinner at Kopje Lodge where the rhinos seem to walk right up to you, really cool. The staff is for the most part friendly and willing to  answer any questions you have about the animals. Nice relaxing evening out. Not to pricey for members, I strongly recommend this because of all the discounts. 👍👍😁</Review>

<Review>We are members of the zoo. We think its worth it and really enjoy the zoo. The bird show is great! Getting to feed a giraffe 🦒 is the coolest!
Lots of things to see and do and a lot of fun even for younger age children</Review>< gmapID>

<username>Althea Hokafonu<//username><Text>My kids had a great time here at the zoo in Fresno our first time attending (we’re new residents to Fresno from the Bay Area) the most fascinating part was when we had our first time experience feeding the giraffes super fun the best times to attend are the earlier the better closer to when they open bc of parking space it’s the perfect family outing esp when it’s beautiful out also they had an awesome Zoorassic park my son is obsessed w dinosaurs so it worked out perfect he was absolutely fascinated so worth every Penny the priceless look on his face thank you for making our money worth it & such enjoyable experience we can’t wait to go back again</Text><Rate>5<//Rate>< Response>

The Fresno zoo is awesome! They have great programs for the animals. The enclosures are large and well-kept. Plenty of opportunities for kids to be hands-on. The restaurant is surprisingly good. Never been disappointed with the food.</review>

We've gotten family season passes to the Chaffee Zoo for 4 years straight. It's a great atmosphere and will always support our local zoo. Came here as a kid with my great grandma once a month or so and have fond memories here. Now I'm making memories with my 2 kids. 115 bucks for season pass and 35 or 40 for the zoorassic park season pass exhibit. It's worth it. We come once a week at least just to get the kids out and see some exotic animals. We've had our son's birthday here and been to another boys birthday and the staff are very accommodating. The food in the Africa area is also pretty good. Better then fast food but not quite restaurant style. Bird shows are always nice. I do wish they would open the path from the reptile house to the Sea Lions as that was open when I was a kid and since that area is a dead end there isn't alot of incentive to go over there.<//review>

A beautiful park. Lots of activities for kids. There is a zoorassic park inside for dinosaur fans. My kids loved that. I will try giraffe feeding next time.< /Text>

<Review>They have a few new items added since I was there 3 years ago.  The restaurant overlooking a field with rhinos and other animals was pretty popular. Feeding the giraffes was fun and the dinosaur exhibit was neat. But you have to pay extra which I didn't like. A lot of exhibits were under construction.</Review><Date>1618995796823< /Date>< UserId.>

This place has definitely gotten better with their exhibits. I wasn't born and raised here but my wife was and she has mentioned how much it's gotten better for the animals. They have added many exhibits and are still expanding.

Definitely recommend this zoo! Don't let the area where the zoo is located scare you from coming. It's absolutely beautiful!< /text>

We were there last Friday. We bought our tickets in advance online. When we got there there was a huge line for people with no tickets, we had no line since we had tickets. Being Easter weekend, there was A LOT of people, but we really enjoyed it. There's a lot of construction going on, so some exhibits were closed. We loved the Zoorassic World! Our son loved feeding the Giraffes. Food was great!< /text>

The zoo has come a long way from when I was last there. Much more natural habitats for a large number of exhibits. The kids loved it.<//text>

< review>
The park restroom aren't clean at all, broken glass at the picnic tables and I had to clean it up myself in order for the kids not to get cut. Men were using the restrooms with the door wide open and little kids playing and running around, if I can see it I know they seen it too. I know they work so hard on restoring the Zoo and Storyland but don't forget about the restrooms and the play area and the picnic area these places need tending too also. You can catch diseases in unclean restrooms, toilets wouldn't flush. But I already know better I had my Lysol spray, wipes paper, towels and each time I had to go to the restroom I made sure I sprayed it down.<//review>

<username>Diana Jimenez< /username><time>1615689821145<//time><rating>4<//rating><review>Beautiful zoo. Some areas are under construction and I am sure it will be even better. It was true when they said it's better than Oakland's or San Jose's, Fresno is bigger. I loved how there's an elotero man and ice cream at the entrance/exit. Parking is 5$ and there's  a lot of space to park.

There is one thing I didn't  like which is that they charge for the Dinosaur area is just a walk through I believe it should be imcluded with the entrance fee but oh well it was still a nice experience.

Buy your tickets online it will save you a lot of time and you will be happy you get to not stand in line :) have fun.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMyKOJ_rckoxZetzpe20-0w-UFQeBOdFneVZZwV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEBYEHAT1q6npgiGTRZeCm691pIzmAgTN5aBuJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNS-qoAnQSI6y--AKjN12vKPM3MSXCWeC49F6XA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEy2LzgBJL98y9M9U_e87WU5ag3pxzvUS-Q7nS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6< /Gmap_id></record>

<rate>2</rate><review>Too much construction going on to raise the prices as high as they did. Almost $20 per adult, yet I did not see one monkey, elephant, tiger, lion, chimpanzees, none of that. Saw a few birds, pet some goats they're trying to say are exotic animals, & had to constantly dodge all the wild squirrels. In fact, only 2 stars because most of the staff were friendly, knowledgeable & genuinely cared.< /review>< pictures>

We had a great day at the Fresno Zoo! It was our first time here so we booked an early time. It was a great idea because the park was not crowded at all and the animals seemed to be pretty active! The park design is nicely laid out, with restrooms and little spots to snack along the way. Feeding the giraffe and the sting rays were probably my favorite part! Make sure to buy the all inclusive passes they are the best way to get your money's worth. Make sure your phone is charged so you can scan your tickets if you buy them online. Great way to spend the day and inexpensive too!<//text>

This place is truly amazing I buy my family a zoo pass every year combined with the fresno park entry pass the kids love it the best part is I have toddler so if she starts to act up or get cranky we just leave and come back another day without feeling like we wasted a lot of money. It also leaves me more money throughout the year to buy snacks and toys while visiting.< /Review>

Also it allowed us to see everything they have to offer without getting lost or backtracking and within a reasonable amount of time. And we didn't feel rushed. My son loved it!<//text>< Response>

I love our local zoo. We get season tickets every year. If your local you should too. Lots to see with the safari adventure, my favorite, making your trip more then worth it. I'm giving it four stars since it can't beat San Diego and Fresno doesn't offer enough attractions around it to make far travel worth it. However you also won't break the bank. All animal lovers around and or Traveling through,  your support goes to a great cause and doesn't disappoint.</review>

They have animal shows, a petting zoo, and a pretty wide range of animals. There's snack bars and a restaurant in the park,  as well, to appease your starving stomachs from walking around in the zoo. The zoo also provides a place for outdoor parties. You'd just have to reserve it.</Review>< Pictures>

I am so shocked and thrilled at the amount of animal enrichment, and habitat quality and care that the zookeepers provide for all of their animals needs both physically and mentally.

My family and I enjoyed this zoo and continue to contribute to this amazing zoos potential to the Central valley.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Haven't been to the zoo in ages. Went recently with the family and it's a nice little experience. Get some good walking in too. Unfortunately with the construction, some of the more "fun" animals to see are not available. But overall it's a pretty good zoo in Fresno's backyard.<//Review>< Rating>

<Name>david morais< /Name><Review>What Chaffee done to the zoo from when I was a kid is great. The improvement look fantastic. The zoo was crowded but I can understand people like myself wanted to get out. Good to see everyone following the mask rules. Some of the exhibits had lines to enter them. Currently I see construction going on in the center of the zoo for an Asian area animals and if it's anything like the at African area it will be good.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><rating>4< /rating><gmap_id>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6<//gmap_id><Time>1614484951440<//Time><user>105116906333845711156< /user></record>

Great little zoo... Lots of interactive exhibits... You can even feed the giraffes! My hubby free up in San Diego so needless to say we've been to the SD Zoo lots of times, but you can't feed the giraffes in SD so I think that makes or zoo special</Text>

My family and I love this zoo! The people that work there are extremely nice and the zookeepers take the time to talk and answer any questions that you have. The animals are well cared for and the zoo is big. The food is decently priced. Do yourself a favor and get the refillable cup.<//text>

<review>This is a wonderful zoo for the location and price but we have had a few frustrating issues.  The animal enclosures are all very large and do a good job of replicating the animal's natural habitats.  They are building a new section that looks very promising with some exciting new animals.  We especially enjoy the seal habitat, the African savanna area, and interactive areas like the stingray pool, petting zoo, and bird enclosures.  Some of the employees are a little too ambitious about enforcement of the mask rules considering everything is mostly outdoors.  The family membership is a good deal but we were disappointed with the dinosaur exhibit.  We paid the $36 to be able to get in all year only to have it cancelled after 2 months because they closed temporarily.  We emailed them about it but didn't not receive an extension or refund.< /review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>It’s a zoo what i can I say. Small city zoo. Has few activities which kids loved was feeding the giraffe. Kids were very excited to see the dinosaurs. It would be nicer if it was more motion activated. But still we had a blast. There is story land next door for rides which is closed on Monday and Tuesday.</Text><Time>1565208998161<//Time><Rate>5</Rate><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

They have definitely come a long way! I absolutely adore the lodge next to the animals ! The animals also look semi free since there is so much space in that enclosure. I also love the events they have. My kids and I just attended zooboo tonight since we had attended Zoo lights last year. I love it !< /Review>

Great place to enjoy time with your family and see beautiful animals! BUT when we went in 03/21 it was super packed, long lines for everything and was under so much construction that a lot of our fave animals weren't even out! I hope the improvements are worth it because i felt a little underwhelmed.  I would suggest you go when the new exhibit is done. To beat the long line buy tickets online beforehand.< /text>

It would be 5 stars if not for the recent mask requirement. We're literally outside. Plus they limit capacity. There's no reason to require masks outside at the zoo when you can dine inside a restaurant without a mask. Just saying.< /Text>

Smaller than expected. Still was very fun. The bird caged area was our favorite. The Giraffe feeding was our favorite.<//Text>

It's a smaller zoo but the animals are well cared for and seem a lot healthier AND happier than compared to animals at other zoos I've been to. The staff is nice and the park is clean, my son loves it and I bet he'll love it even more when they finish their expansions. Can't wait to see the end results.< /Review>

Great place to bring the kids, suggest earlier the better. And buy tickets in advance!! Avoid the lines. Go early leave as soon as your kid get upset. Then come back for evening relaxing. Food was fast and perfect. Line get long if you don't reserve.</text>

We ordered food inside the zoo and the cashier was rude and full of herself. The food was horrible made my stomach hurt they didn't have mayo for the hotdogs and the popcorn was stale.My son ordered fries with cheese they put very little cheese. Most of the food we tried to order they were out and it was only 3pm they close at 7pm. We walked a lot didn't see that many animals and was expecting more from the zoorassic park. Overall made the best of it and tried to enjoy ourselves.</text>

<Text>Awesome zoo, definitely top 5 in the state of CA. I hadn't been since before the African Adventures expansion and it makes it feel like a whole new zoo.

So glad the Zoo is open again! Some things are shut down and some animals aren't out because of cold weather BUT it was still a good time. Loved feeding the stingrays and giraffes. Excited to see the new spices coming soon with all the construction.< /review>

Big zoo some really cool exhibits (zoorastic dinosaurs and feeding the Sting Ray petting and feeding the giraffes) but unless you have the premium entry they all cost extra. The whole Asian Kingdom exhibit was closed for construction. Our tickets were gifted to us I would have been disappointed if I'd paid $25 a piece to get in (for the premium pass) once the Asian Kingdom is completed it might be worth another visit.< /text>

Non-member lines were insane couldn't reserve tickets until 5pm park closes at 6pm wasn't a good deal but got to become a member the family pack is a good deal and purchase some add-ons and we're set for the whole year. Park like always is amazing kids will love it.< /Text><name>Rita Ochoa-Gonzalez< /name><Gmap_id>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6</Gmap_id><Rating>5< /Rating>< user>

A really good experience. As of 05/23/2021, they are working on Asian experience, this means that Gharial, Tiger, Panda, and few other animals will not be present.<//review>

It would be 5 stars if not for the recent mask requirement. We're literally outside. Plus they limit capacity. There's no reason to require masks outside at the zoo when you can dine inside a restaurant without a mask. Just saying.</Text>

<text>What Chaffee done to the zoo from when I was a kid is great. The improvement look fantastic. The zoo was crowded but I can understand people like myself wanted to get out. Good to see everyone following the mask rules. Some of the exhibits had lines to enter them. Currently I see construction going on in the center of the zoo for an Asian area animals and if it's anything like the at African area it will be good.< /text>< UserId.>

<text>It's a smaller zoo but the animals are well cared for and seem a lot healthier AND happier than compared to animals at other zoos I've been to. The staff is nice and the park is clean, my son loves it and I bet he'll love it even more when they finish their expansions. Can't wait to see the end results.< /text>< time>

Great little zoo... Lots of interactive exhibits... You can even feed the giraffes! My hubby free up in San Diego so needless to say we've been to the SD Zoo lots of times, but you can't feed the giraffes in SD so I think that makes or zoo special<//text>

I'm sure it's better than the experience I had. I went during covid-19 so there were no maps for me to hold. I didn't realize there was a second better eatery further down. Also, there were many areas closed for construction or due to covid-19 safety. I plan to go again in the future when everything is reopened because it definitely is worth going again.</review>

This place is nice for kids, I was looking for a place to park my car for about 30 minutes but that’s probably because it was Saturday not too many animals the place is huge it would take you couple of hours to walk around, kids really love the new place they have built with all the dinosaurs 🦕< /Review>

We love the zoo. We have a great digging for the dinosaurs parts. Great place to take your kids. The dinosaurs 🦕 look so real.</text>

The aquarium is nicely presented for children  and they have small indoor playground for kids under 5. Only one downside was the food. It was just okay. Pizza, sandwiches, and salads were not so great but eatable. Recommend any one with little kids as well as big one.< /Review>< Pics>

We love bringing our little ones to this zoo. The giraffe feeding is the favorite stop for our family. Going to pet the farm animals isn’t quite hitting the list yet at least.  We love stopping by to see the tiger, rhinos, and the elephants. There are a lot of animals to see and the enclosures are well kept. Not only that but the zoo keepers are highly knowledgeable.

The cafe at the zoo is great also with tasty and healthy options for kids and parents. The membership is well worth and has paid for itself many times over with the number of times we go a year. Not only that but the entrance line for members is always much shorter or nonexistent.

The Fresno zoo is a great place to spend time as a family.</text>

<Text>I was truly impressed by the renovations that have been done to the zoo. It's nothing like it was 20 someting years ago. The animlas have more space and it has a very natural habitat feel to it. I loved it!!!<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>There is currently construction of new exhibits in process, and that is fairly intrusive but at the same time well managed and didn't dampen our day. Almost everyone was wearing masks. The animals had a lot of space and there was ample viewing room. We had a great time.< /Review><Name>Charlene Brown</Name>< Response>

<date>1599424823638< /date><Rating>5</Rating><text>This zoo is so big, so you get a lot of exercise. Wear tennis shoes. So much interaction for the kids even Durning a pandemic! They have sanitizing stations everywhere and they have signs to remind you to wear masks. They take precautions to make sure people are six feet apart. Right now in the month of September through December they're going to have a dinosaur exhibition after those months it will be removed it really is cool and Worth to see there's even some dinosaurs that spray you with water. There is a food court you can relax and eat your food and there's a separate part to the food court where you could take your children and give them a bottle or help them nap or breastfeed your children. The bathroom seemed pretty clean it looks like they tend to them regularly. All the animals seem to be out and enjoying the warm weather they have misters for them or little waterfalls or some sort of water interaction so that they stay cool. You could feed the stingrays feed the giraffes for a couple of dollars per person. Right now you can not feed or pet the goats and sheep because of the covid 19. There is a play area that's currently closed for kids that is a water park the only thing available on it is the shower heads that you can use to cool down. The ice cream cones are only a dollar and they fill them up and put them also in a cup so it's basically like ice cream for two people for only $1. the sea lions are very active and I would suggest going underneath where the little cave area is so you can see them swimming underwater it's a great picture opportunity. They have little stands where you can pose for pictures everywhere! The family pass sis worth the money if you go frequently. If you love animals there's definitely lots to look at and they're very interactive. I personally had a nice experience with a macaw in the rainforest area if you say hello to him he will say hello back or if you dance and tell him to dance with you he'll dance back.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_PmkaL9qqIhyk7D0DP0aJl8Z4KiWLgd85K1TW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQQuw-1sR9APpz76auLZw-9YemLTvMApZIpSeL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIWOIjZ_IBabxXbdOYhE0S4ch8Kv5HTT24Q8d9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZqfNCmLR_2ZwZ9pqImeYgqPXAy8mXfBb1Og3S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAJFM9c0GpwOCNYDyVXp8pWAOb7DDicbB0kVF-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3WJe8wcBHVinjdc4lXD-pqLcDwtY5BRGOAvdS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWAgPTI0G5fVpgEv66ywEJY4UzXWMKfclFrFSa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNskcNJXizN4Tq0tCSIBGO4LE7epHtIwvVw4JdA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Resp>

<text>Very pleasantly surprised at what this zoo offered. My toddler and preschooler were excited to even forget their nap. In just 5 hours, we enjoyed a bird show, lion training, giraffe feeding, petting goats and alpacas, an adorable baby Rhino with it's family and so much more!

And here's the best part - all of this for sub-$10 per person!!! Definitely worth visiting!</text><gmap_id>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6</gmap_id>< resp>

<Review>Very nice smaller zoo. They need a few more bathrooms throughout the park. Their exhibits are pretty cool and they're growing. Its too bad though you have to pay extra for some of the attractions.</Review>< user_name>

<Text>First you pay to get in, then you have to pay inside to see different areas of the park such as the giraffes, the dinosaur display, etc. and they were $6.00 a person. Plus there was hardly any animals to see! It was a big disappointment.</Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<Review>I went today waited in line for almost 4 hours and the line only moved a few feet within those hours. Once we asked why the line wasn’t moving the workers told us that the zoo exceeded their capacity. Yet they were still letting in people that pre paid tickets and even people with memberships( or people becoming members). It was not fair that they weren’t letting us in because the zoo “Exceeded it’s capacity “ yet they were still letting people in.therefore we were never going to go in because it obviously was never going to get below capacity due to them letting dozens of people in still. NEVER going back.< /Review>< gmap_id>

<text>Flat out great zoo, and should be for a city this size.
The Sea Lion Cove is an award winning presentation.
I'm sure the African Savannah will also win some kind of zoo awards too.
The African Savannah cabana food court is incredible. Great spot to rest up.
The LIVE bird show everyday, is over the top great. Maybe my fave.
The walk through bird cages are as good as any zoo in CA.
You can spend the better part of a day here.
Also, if you like taking photos of flying birds, the park pond outside the zoo is the best action around. Many different varieties.</text><Rating>5< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

We came here during the summer for a quick visit during our road trip to Sacramento. It was five dollars to park and then I believe $12 to get in. My kids really liked the open zero theme they were able to feed a giraffe as well as see many other animals even though it was very hot that day.< /review>

<review>40 acres and about 7 under construction for an Asian area. Well worth the visit. The African area is fantastic!< /review>< pics>

<text>Had such a great time!! The new Safari exhibit with the Elephants, Wildebeest and Giraffes is so awesome! And there is a awesome space to eat and watch the whole exhibit while the kids play on some rocks and the adults can relax! There is a really nice firepit too for when it's cold. And there are multiple stand up heaters to keep you warm too. Really nice job they are doing to the zoo!< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVTUwTyVhf9ZrKJAHamAILx0w7s_BVX_UcZ0D6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOH1j3QlJWn9aKAxt6NL9juGpjT6zXVM4v3XYy2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOaiMqY4RHdirT4Dr3FwzEw9-MveeQPrmgBS6I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNisXiVClyuBAOXF408m7FmjNMQVFCIuzK7lmkL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUQFOF-aR2lPFnJUAzMxEUad4C69uTMIJWtTZ4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOY2_gJX82aGAxVuA81fKqIXpCQrlUizNCxYUSy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_LyXaDyp3mAdWlF8Db3UrAnq96KhLSs1pXsaT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPd1XVg017P51Ju-i7Oai0tYeJqaDGPKa_KMAq4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEtFwI1KAu6F4qkNB-d-xRn6fqFeYpPnZwruHx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9_wtOUmxA0AxdpaENHGT8-SS90eCuP24854Ws=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJuG993LUAI_hiib6EOi2IrqWE3UWTg0d4BFl9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsRr0mj2ouLNlBbDymsH8t8mCpAk-CkihN0hCz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN16FBaYW0fYhY78nt-ttyVUPADJmRlMagKBm8K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIxC4ZOiKPzslA5tcHzCZYBDuAX7AUQWLfg6GL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

Took my grandbaby on a Saturday for sonething to do.  We live in Los Angeles and have never gone to the Fresno Zoo.  Parking is horrible!! Waited in line a hour or more. Should have bought online. Who knew? Just a day outting. Well we didn't see many animals and the few we did see was sleep, sleeping oor whatever. Had to pay $4 each to see the stingrays abd $2 if you wanted to feed them...should  have been included in the price of admission. No I won't be going back!😥<//Review>

Very long line, but great place to go.  Best to get your reservation online because once they reach a certain capacity, they cap it and won't let the line move until people leave.< /Text>

<review>Our family of 6 had a great day here while visiting from out of town. Good value. We did the total experience ticket so the Zoorasic Park, giraffe feeding, and stingray bay experiences were highlights. A few exhibits are closed for Covid and a fair amount of the zoo is under construction but we still had a great experience. The bird show was fun as well ... Not quite to the level I've seen at other zoos but still a great way to sit down for a while and be entertained.

Seems like they could have been doing elephant shows and sea lion shows. But hey, Covid puts a damper on things and is probably affecting all that.

I'd definitely recommend it for families to spend a day here. One of the highlights of our fresno visit.

I dropped $80 for lunch but the food was good and prepared on site. The wait for the food was a bit longer than expected and they didn't honor my no cheese request on my salad.<//review><time>1618102143446</time>< user_id>

I love the zoo and since they were making reservations  times I figured it wouldn’t be so busy I wanted to take my son to the zoo for the first time and it felt so unsafe with a whole bunch of people not wearing masks we literally left with an hour of getting there because of how unsafe we felt my whole family is vaccinated but my 11 month old son is not and the amount of people not wearing masks was ridiculous the zoo really needs to enforce mask wearing and have certain areas where they can take masks off I won’t be coming back for a while< /text>

<Time>1613974578850<//Time><Review>Worst visit ever. Will not return. Line was long, and we got close enough to the front they stopped letting people in that were buying tickets at the zoo. They said it was because they reached their capacity but yet they were letting people with memberships in. It’s not right and not fair, if you reached capacity it should apply to everyone. They told us that they prioritized members first, shouldn’t all guest be prioritized? They didn’t allow people to buy general admission tickets but yet they allowed people to buy membership packages and were allowed in. That makes no sense, they were not organized at all. My family and I will not be going back.< /Review><userid>113279863356872062221</userid><Gmap_id>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6<//Gmap_id></record>

Have not been here in over 30 years. My mom wanted to go and I was more than happy to take her, just like she used to bring me when I was a child. Bought tickets for breakfast with the animals. It was fun and lots of people. So many changes from over 30 years ago. We enjoyed ourselves.</Review>

< Review>
My kids & I absolutely LOVE the Chaffed Zoo, even tho it has a lot of exciting exhibits under construction at the moment, they still have plenty to see and do, feedings are still do able, the animal talks & shows, Zoorasic is till open YAY!, gift shop is setup right outside so it's nice. Strict COVID guild lines in place if you care to know that information. Also, I highly suggest getting the zoo's membership if you visit quite frequently, & of you don't I bet getting the membership will make you want to go more. Such a fun time for the family, even see just couples there as well. Great for everyone of all ages.</Review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>The park itself is cool..there is a lot of construction. HOWEVER this new "zoosaurus" that just ope ed was pretty cool. A lot of different dinos that look extremely good. The African Safari has been tremendous add in. Once the zoo is fully finished it will be AMAZING and definitely ey catching with all the different  animals.< /review><Gmap_id>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6</Gmap_id><user_name>Yo Gotu</user_name><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvniaAkpI-B2JpxBi7EBnwXH2TQEEL2V911XZu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< date>

<text>Awesome experience!
The zoo was clean. The staff are very helpful and friendly.
The exhibits were not only educational but fun.
Most importantly, the animals look healthy and have adequate room, water, shade, misters, and fans. This is very important in this valley heat.

My 6 y/o had a blast.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Zoo is clean and animals look in great condition. COVID precautions are non-existent, we went (purchased the tickets online) there was a huge line and the people were piled with no guidance or signage to what the "lines" were for.  Inside the park people were not wearing the masks and continued their trip instead of taking their "breather" (break from the mask) off to the side.  No one was around enforcing masks to be on for the sake of the kids. Also kids were all over the structures without masks and no sanitizer was near some of the structures kids were on.<//Text><resp>None<//resp>< user_id>

They have definitely come a long way! I absolutely adore the lodge next to the animals ! The animals also look semi free since there is so much space in that enclosure.</Text>

<Text>At the moment due to Covid-19 many attractions are closed. The zoo has many attractions under construction as well, but prices for tickets are still the same. They should have some sort of a discount until attractions become fully available. The restrooms were also very dirty and unkept, no toilet tissue in one of them. Not the experience we had hoped for.< /Text><resp>None<//resp>< username>

I have always enjoyed visiting Chaffee Zoo, but this last visit was a bit different.  I was unaware of the vast development that is taking place there which meant cramped space, no primates, where was the condore?  Empty exhibits. . . Bathrooms were dirty, empty soap containers, empty toilet paper dispensers. I think I'll wait about a year for my next possible visit.</text>

<Text>The Fresno Chaffee Zoo is one of the best zoo's I've ever visited!  I'm from San Diego so I've been to their zoo and Safari Park numerous times, and they're both really cool.  But considering the new design of the Chaffee Zoo, their animals, the amenities, and just how cool the zoo is, it's really hard to beat!  It gets hot in the summer and they even have a splash park for the kids.  They've really thought of everything.  My family goes all the time...keep up the good work!</Text>< pics>

I love going to the zoo but today it was me and my sister , now is in a electric chair ,some of the rail are at the eye sight were it was hard to see. That is not all you had to go through the picnic area after the giraffes and that was hard to do. I think you need to have someone take a trip around the zoo in a chair. By the way she has MD so its a little hard to get around. And just a little note you need to swipe the walk way around the seals it was pretty  slipper and I was wearing shoes  not saddles. Thanks had a great time.</Text>

We had so much fun feeding the giraffe. It was only 3 dollars. 3 dollars is the cost to purchase a leaf of lettuce. Visited during the week and avoided all the crowds.<//review>

< Review>
My boys and I really enjoyed our animal adventure today. Just about every animal was out and about basking in the sun. It wasn't crowded and everyone for the most part wore masks. We really enjoyed feeding the giraffe. Because of social distancing we actually had a good amount of time to visit and ask questions. Everything was clean and the staff was polite and said hello all day. Great experience. We will be back soon.</Review>

I haven't been here since the sea lion cove was constructed and wow! I Love the updates that have been done! So many beautiful animals in the African safari and they are not yet! I'm definitely coming back. But also, I love that they hold special events here, really cool.</Review>

Had a good experience here. A lot of different animals to see. The zoo cafe has good and affordable snacks and food. The only problem is the heat in summer so just keep some water.< /text>

Definitely recommend reserving ticket online before you go, we were able to cruise past a 100 person line and go straight in at our designated time. As far as the zoo itself it's ok in it's current state - several exhibits (including the kids area) are closed due COVID and remodel which detracted a bit from the general entrance experience (we didn't do the add-ons)< /Review>

We love this place. A great variety of animals to observe. The African Savanna is beautiful with lions, rhinos, giraffes, and many more. We spent about 3-4 hours here. Make sure to catch the Winged Wonder bird show when you come.<//Review>

<review>Me and my son love the zoo, but there’s so much construction going on at once, right now, it really takes away from the experience.<//review>< name>

We love love the zoo I have been going since I was a little girl and now I have my own little girl and we go all the time I have gotten a sense pass every year. Its amazing being here when I was on leave from work I would come to the zoo every single day just to get away from life its self and just enjoy the zoo park and seeing all the animals are just amazing thank you all for being a member and supporting our zoo and all our beautiful animals that we have saved. The food could be alil cheaper cause times are very hard for everyone... and we all have more then one child these days. I feel if it was alil cheaper where people would come way more cause its alil more affordable and all that we spend their goes to supporting our animals for sure. We are headed out their today

A LOT is cut off from seeing because of construction on site, but that's not what made me give a low score.  Making my 2 year old put on a mask for just walking in the door was ridiculous.  He has a sensory disorder and won't wear one at all so threatening to not even let us in when we drove almost 45 minutes to get there put stress on me and my two small children.
Masking children is absolutely unnecessary.< /text>

<Text>This is a zoo that I love to visit with the family,  animals seem more content and healthy. The family has a chance to learn about these magnificent creatures while having a bit if interaction. For a small fee you can touch and possibly feed stingrays as well as the giraffes.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>This is an awesome zoo. The pride of lions are so cool. They have a huge dining area and it oversees the african savannah exhibit . Gotta love being able to feed the giraffes and sting rays. Will definitely be coming back we want to see those zoo lights!</Review>< Pics>

Could use a little bit more funding due to lack of space for the animals. I honestly think zoos should be huge and big so the animals have more space to run around and exercise. It seems like they were more occupied on building structures for people and customers instead of the animals. There's a crapload of parking spaces that could be modified or turned into more animal exhibits.<//review>< pics>

This zoo is amazing! It's one of my favorite zoos, after only visiting once! It's a large zoo, with tons of animals, restaurants, and nice walking paths. There are also places for younger kids do to run and play. Everything was very clean, and the animals looked like they had a bigger space to roam than most animals at other zoos that I've been too. The reptile and amphibian building was awesome. Also, the new baby rhino is ridiculously cute!!!</Text>

One of the better zoo's in California! It's clean, relatively quiet, and spacious. Most of the animals are of African original, and their habitats reflect this. You can casually walk the zoo in 3-4 hours.< /review>

<Review>Fresno Zoo is a pretty fun and open space perfect for family trips! Even during the pandemic, the park is open for all to enjoy as long as you bring a mask. The park does limit how many people can enter in at one time, however so there can be a very long line for anyone who wants to buy their ticket there. Despite that though, most of the animals are still there and a new exhibit will be coming in next year!< /Review><userid>114647779707495303688</userid><gmapID>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6< /gmapID></record>

Currently a little torn up during construction. The new Asian exhibit will be awesome when it opens.</review>

<review>I spend a pleasant day wandering around the zoo. The bird aviaries were plenty large enough. All animal enclosure were large and clean. The animals all seemed content except for the tiger who was continually pacing. Probably close to feeding time. I would have liked to see more animals. The setup was a little confusing. I would recommend a few footprints painted on the sidewalk to guide visitors on a complete your of the grounds. I was pleased to see a giant anteater which you don't see often at zoos. I was also pleased to see the kangaroo exhibit. All staff that I talked to were very friendly and knowledgeable. A good day.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOynQa1v8XDMAXI1cYy-ThRtLOhALvavOEB6PtV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNetzN4OckiqDB5YZqy8Qj4-rbPJ3MBP_mNSkWg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_2RA-QPMKdxfrPg1ZANLoVbrXzEKAd6sLlCW7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzPGyfkqz0erziGrZ-h6O85k0jQsEsoITfzkGa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_RMVDYDfteVLjXsN1VmxHCSLkXC5u348WSpHS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMq1vaAg88amB_ZJ0VF661doXoQC6_VA01-y3e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6< /Gmap_id></record>

<Review>Awesome experience!
The zoo was clean. The staff are very helpful and friendly.
The exhibits were not only educational but fun.
Most importantly, the animals look healthy and have adequate room, water, shade, misters, and fans. This is very important in this valley heat.

My 6 y/o had a blast.</Review></record></dataset><record>

At the moment due to Covid-19 many attractions are closed. The zoo has many attractions under construction as well, but prices for tickets are still the same. They should have some sort of a discount until attractions become fully available. The restrooms were also very dirty and unkept, no toilet tissue in one of them. Not the experience we had hoped for.< /Review>

<Text>I have always enjoyed visiting Chaffee Zoo, but this last visit was a bit different.  I was unaware of the vast development that is taking place there which meant cramped space, no primates, where was the condore?  Empty exhibits. . . Bathrooms were dirty, empty soap containers, empty toilet paper dispensers. I think I'll wait about a year for my next possible visit.</Text>< name>

< Review>
Had a great experience here today visiting from Minnesota. The animals seemed happy and well cared for and the exhibits were clean. Even the notoriously smelly sea lion exhibit could barely be detected. Was so impressed for the size of the zoo. Staff was all really friendly and seemed to enjoy what they were doing.</Review>

<review>I love this zoo. I'm not from the area but visit a friend once a year or so and we go almost every time I'm here. The giraffes are my favorite followed closely by the chacoan peccaries and tropical birds. The petting zoo is a nice feature and all the animals seem happy. Keepers and volunteers are knowledgeable and friendly.
Highly recommend this zoo.< /review></record>

Amazing place, love how theyre trying to extend it to give the animals more capacity to roam around, u might find the food expensive, but i know it must not be cheap to feed every single animal.< /Text>

<text>Always enjoy coming here. The employees are helpful and willing to answer any questions you may have. They take time with kids to make sure they don't feel ignored or dismissed.

I would recommend grabbing lunch here and enjoy the views of the savanna with the rhinos and elephants.<//text>< Resp>

<review>(Posted this on another zoo location? , either way The Fresno Chaffee Zoo is great) Had such a wonderful Saturday at the zoo! There have been so many updates, new exhibits, experiences, food choices--this zoo is a point of pride for any Fresno resident. We spend the whole morning and early afternoon and got to see everything the zoo has to offer. There are zoo staff at many of the exhibits and they were all very helpful and very knowledgeable about each animal. Would love to go back soon.<//review><user_id>108207168080487259039<//user_id>< pictures>

My kids enjoyed the zoo even though the zoo is under some pretty heavy construction, as a result some of the our favorite zoo exhibits (like the tiger and asian bear) are closed and will be close for a couple years according to zoo employees.< /review>

Most of the safari animals and sea lion/seal habitat had a decent sized enclosures. Some of the other animal enclosures appeared to be far too small for the animals. The orangutan seemed incredibly depressed and looked to be lonely. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Definitely something you could do in one day.<//text>

<review>One of the best zoo I have been. It has a great collection of Africa animals, including at least 4 giraffes, 3 elephant, 3 rhinos (2 different kinds), 4 lions!!!! We went as a family trip when the zoo held it's annual Frogs & Fairytale activity. It had Disney princesses (besides Milan, Cinderella, or Rapunzel) for children to have pictures with, different art and craft activities, instant photo booth, and spot that professional helped our children to put up their make-up or face painting. We had a blast!!!!</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLOB2a_xiBQ0i-ntfM2IU9i8gEPxMRF5LjOyGM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhiMlcrs-jZeu48qDegdNiE9mwJLjAX1dZxJVK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

Exciting habitat enclosures, the stingray bay, upgrading this zoo all the time. Great care of the animals and exhibits. Covid conscience, shaded areas for the heat, placement of quick refreshment stands. Very thoughtful educational talks at most enclosures. I like it far better than the SF zoo.<//Review>

A few years ago this zoo was not in the best shape and was no different than any other small town zoo. In recent years, however, they have made some excellent improvements to the facility including an expansion they call African Adventure. This area is awesome and houses many animals that call Africa their natural habitat like elephants, lions, cheetahs, rhinos and giraffes (that you can feed for just $3.00) but also some not so well known or favorites animals such as wildebeests and antelopes. The animals are fairly active for being in containment which is nice to see and the staff is always do friendly and never minds when my kids ask a million questions about the animals.  The food in this expansion is great but fairly pricey. I have a family season pass for 2 adults and 3 kids (we needed to add on a child as it normally comes with just 2) which costs about $75.00-$80.00 a year which is definitely worth it if you go more than 2 times a year. The pass gives you discounts throughout the zoo on food and souvenirs as well as a admission to some special events like their ice cream social and some events not open to the general public.<//Text>

<Review>I love this zoo. I'm not from the area but visit a friend once a year or so and we go almost every time I'm here. The giraffes are my favorite followed closely by the chacoan peccaries and tropical birds. The petting zoo is a nice feature and all the animals seem happy. Keepers and volunteers are knowledgeable and friendly.
Highly recommend this zoo.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8xnzd1xYb3lQlDf2wmrhCxcGjKglV4tmbxFZy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNreSReOHZgCH4jkQmPYSA_E6qh3lgxlhk_2WJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6< /GmapID></record>

<date>1564929838169< /date><rating>5</rating><text>A few years ago this zoo was not in the best shape and was no different than any other small town zoo. In recent years, however, they have made some excellent improvements to the facility including an expansion they call African Adventure. This area is awesome and houses many animals that call Africa their natural habitat like elephants, lions, cheetahs, rhinos and giraffes (that you can feed for just $3.00) but also some not so well known or favorites animals such as wildebeests and antelopes. The animals are fairly active for being in containment which is nice to see and the staff is always do friendly and never minds when my kids ask a million questions about the animals.  The food in this expansion is great but fairly pricey. I have a family season pass for 2 adults and 3 kids (we needed to add on a child as it normally comes with just 2) which costs about $75.00-$80.00 a year which is definitely worth it if you go more than 2 times a year. The pass gives you discounts throughout the zoo on food and souvenirs as well as a admission to some special events like their ice cream social and some events not open to the general public.</text>< UserId.>

As far as the zoo itself it's ok in it's current state - several exhibits (including the kids area) are closed due COVID and remodel which detracted a bit from the general entrance experience (we didn't do the add-ons)<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

The admissions cost is only $10 to get in, and it's for a good cause. The money you pay to enter is used to maintain the place and keep things running. I especially like the African Safari that was added. The Chafee Zoo has definitely been remodeled for the better.< /Text>< name>

I wouldn't recommend visiting until the construction is done everything is being renovated and was a mess to walk around. Other than that I'd give it a 4 star<//Review>

<Text>This was our first visit to the Zoo, I'm 100% happy I brought the stroller for my toddler because it's A LOT of walking and if I had to carry my son around I would have died. It was also super nice they give out free water cups because I got my son a juice but all I wanted was to down some water haha the hands on exhibits like the sting Ray's and giraffes were not pricey at all and my son enjoyed them!!! Can't wait to visit again!</Text>< Pictures>

Even with this pandemic we had an okay zoo trip. Wish they would of told us ahead of time about the line we were going to have to get into for the giraffe feeding. I understand they are doing their best but shade needs to be provided</Text>

Excellent small zoo.  African section is great.  Visit it early, because it has the least shade.  Asia is very shady.  Some very nice exhibits with great viewing in areas with room for the animals to roam.< /text>

Awesome new renovation completed. Many many months waiting for them to finish the whole project. They are done and i must say great job Fresno County. I am glad to see what all the taxes went to be beneficial to the community around the county. Not just Fresno so come check it out people, and bring the kids.< /Text>

<Review>The Fresno Chaffee Zoo has been a part of Fresno for decades and has entertained kids and adults and continues to still today. I have very fond memories of it and I'm happy to see it still be a relevant part of Fresno. Thankfully there is continuous expansion in the park and improvements meaning it should hopefully be around for many more years inspiring young minds.</Review><user_name>Joseph Potthast<//user_name>< user>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>Horrible. There is NOTHING, plus if your not a member you have to wait HOURS. EVEN if the members line is empty. The animals look very trapped and anxious, like their pacing around looking stressed AND if you do get inside there is nothing to see, it is very small and dirty, oh and the employes are S, so rude rude and CARELESS. So, if you are thinking of going somewhere on your days off find a better place. Somewhere worth it. If one of you employes are reading this and CARE please ( if you don't want to go back in bankrupcy) fix this. I don't mind paying for membership,but be fair to the people who don't, or the people who buy tickets online!!! So just don't go, Again,TERRIBLE, terrible place.<//text></record>

<Time>1594248877352< /Time><review>Such a great day to break away from the COVID madness.   Park was super clean, lots of animals out and about to see.   Didn’t have to search for them... even in the hot part of the day!  The layout of the park provides LOTS of shade throughout, for the animals and the guests. The habitats are well cared for and staff is very knowledgeable, friendly and helpful!!  They are at every turn ready to assist. We didn’t realize we could take our own food and snacks on so we were prepared to pay outrages prices for food.  To our delight, prices  were really reasonable; 4 of us ate a beautiful healthy lunch for $48, including drinks!! The Zoo is taking the precautions as directed by the state, so just 2-3 areas require a mask.  Overall it was a great visit!!  Will definitely return!< /review><user_name>Diana Staib</user_name>< gmapID>

Very cool place kinda pricey for really not many animals but cool to take your kids and to get out of the house for the day...$18.00 for one adult.
Parking is $5.00
Handicap is free parking

I would go again..

Please like if I helped you

The tiger was so stressed it was pacing terribly, overly skinny as well. Tbh a lot of animals seemed small in size compared to others. Quite a few had such depressed, sad faces, and were constantly pacing, it broke my heart!! The tiger was the saddest of them all 😥If you can't handle seeing animals in stress this isn't the place to go right now, maybe it'll change once they finish construction on the new habitat. Zoo needs to make better enclosures so the animals aren't so depressed asap.< /Text>< Pics>

Very helpful and friendly staff, beautiful animals, and half-decent food. The gift shop is a little ridiculous with how expensive it is, so maybe bring a limited amount of cash so your kids can't pressure you to buy the store. I didn't take any pictures for the second half of our visit because it started raining pretty hard, but there really is a lot to see there.< /Review>

Really really great experience. Could use a little bit more funding due to lack of space for the animals. I honestly think zoos should be huge and big so the animals have more space to run around and exercise. It seems like they were more occupied on building structures for people and customers instead of the animals. There's a crapload of parking spaces that could be modified or turned into more animal exhibits.< /review>

This zoo is amazing!! The sea lions cove is my favorite exhibit. I always have a new experience everytime I visit. The zoo keepers are very friendly and informative. We have a zoo pass so sometimes we just go to have lunch. Fresno's best place to visit!</Text>

<Review>it used to be fun a few years back, but sometime between then and now they began putting money over customers and safety protocols. the lines are so incredibly long, and ticket buyers arent even payed attention to. while members are allowed it when the zoo is quote on quote “at full capacity”, everyone else is forced to wait outside even as people exit. even when theres no members in line, noone else (even people who purchased their tickets online!) is allowed in ?/!:?)3 i saw múltiple people going to employees to complain about this, but still they keep being unfair. its not worth the wait tbh ! its pretty dirty and safety protocols for covid 19 are rarely followed. i hope the quality of the place improves , but for now im afraid i wont be going for a long while</Review>< Gmap_id>

It's not so enjoyable because of all this covid-19 stuff going on. Reptile house is closed. Some animals are being moved to another place/exhibit, so they're gone 😔. MUST wear mask entire time. Signs throughout the park to try & control the direction of traffic. Not the best thought out plan for "flow of traffic".</Review>

< Review>
This zoo is amazing! It's one of my favorite zoos, after only visiting once! It's a large zoo, with tons of animals, restaurants, and nice walking paths. There are also places for younger kids do to run and play. Everything was very clean, and the animals looked like they had a bigger space to roam than most animals at other zoos that I've been too. The reptile and amphibian building was awesome. Also, the new baby rhino is ridiculously cute!!!</Review>

<Review>We love love the zoo I have been going since I was a little girl and now I have my own little girl and we go all the time I have gotten a sense pass every year. Its amazing being here when I was on leave from work I would come to the zoo every single day just to get away from life its self and just enjoy the zoo park and seeing all the animals are just amazing thank you all for being a member and supporting our zoo and all our beautiful animals that we have saved. The food could be alil cheaper cause times are very hard for everyone... and we all have more then one child these days. I feel if it was alil cheaper where people would come way more cause its alil more affordable and all that we spend their goes to supporting our animals for sure. We are headed out their today

This is an awesome zoo. The pride of lions are so cool. They have a huge dining area and it oversees the african savannah exhibit . Gotta love being able to feed the giraffes and sting rays. Will definitely be coming back we want to see those zoo lights!<//review>

Very big zoo. I would go when they open and make a day of it. In my opinion they should stay open longer but because of that if you go when they open and stay all day you should have plenty of time. Everything is open on the weekends but weekdays are just as awesome. The new safari exhibit is huge and wonderful to look at. Diffinitly awesome. Go to the zoo the animals will love you for it.< /review>

It definitely was a cool way to spend the day with my nieces and nephew but it was so hot. I hope they think about putting more misters. So much fun!</Text>

Feeding the giraffes, viewing the lion, lioness, & cub,  and the petting zoo animals are my favorite areas! The admissions cost is only $10 to get in, and it's for a good cause. The money you pay to enter is used to maintain the place and keep things running. I especially like the African Safari that was added. The Chafee Zoo has definitely been remodeled for the better.</text>

<UserId.>108308647676497626653</UserId.><Text>When I was much younger I would not have given this zoo 5 stars. Now, I definitely can. The facility is well maintained, the employees are friendly, and the animals appear to be well taken care of. I have been twice this year so far and I just keep liking it more. I'd definitely recommend heading over and visiting.
As a note: there is some construction going on for a new exhibit, however it will not get in your way during a visit.</Text><rate>5< /rate></record></dataset><record>

Alot of construction so less things to see. The African plains is the best, we could sit and watch the animals all day. Definitely a better trip during the week when there is less people. Overall a great outing for the day.<//Review>

<review>So many amazing opportunities for children of all ages to "dig" and unearth bones and truly gives them a hands on approach to possibilities.
Truly one must plan on more than a single visit as there are so many areas to visit.
The grounds are well maintained...plenty of clean restrooms. Parking is ample though at peak times, you may have to walk a bit further. There are food options as well as coffee bars for those must have cappuccinos and lattes.
The staff are all very helpful.< /review>< Gmap_id>

Been a member for 20 years or so. Pays for itself. New African Savana exhibit was and remains a treat. Pride Rock for the lions. Hippos and other animals grazing.sea lion cove is great. Cant say I have a complaint.  Need more great  apes though. Wish they could put the long planned aquarium on same site. Would be a major tourist attraction.<//Text>

I liked it, it was very nice. I especially liked the Elephant exhibit, the animals have ample room to roam. The reptile house was also very AWESOME although I didn't take any pictures this trip, I will next trip, because I'm definitely going back<//review>

I thought it would be cool for them to see some of the animals that grace our TV screen with their own two eyes. I got to experience the SF zoo and I loved every minute of it. When we got there I instantly loved the realistic layout of every animal's enclosure. The zoo seemed well kept and the animals looked healthy and vibrant. That was until we got to the Tiger. First of all he was pacing back and forth obviously stressed but that I could have overlooked because it's common for some animals to become stressed in captivity. The thing that nipped and pulled at my heart strings was his frail extremely thin stature. He looked severely malnourished and it literally broke my heart to see him in such a state. It really bothered me to show my kids this Tiger (especially since he was one of animals they were looking forward to seeing). I never had a negative thought about animals in zoos but seeing him made it clear what PETA had been preaching all these years. Kind of ruined my perception of the zoo and I don't think I'll be going to the zoo anytime soon. Just my opinion.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6<//gmap_id></record>

< Review>
Really great zoo! Lots to see and do here. We spent about 5 hours here and STILL didn't see everything, but we were plenty satisfied with everything we did see and do. Besides general admission, you can pay a little extra for a giraffe feeding experience and to touch sting rays. Several animal trainer talks throughout the day at various locations.<//Review>

<review>Very helpful and friendly staff, beautiful animals, and half-decent food. The gift shop is a little ridiculous with how expensive it is, so maybe bring a limited amount of cash so your kids can't pressure you to buy the store. I didn't take any pictures for the second half of our visit because it started raining pretty hard, but there really is a lot to see there.<//review>< Time>

Petting the stingrays/sharks is by far my favorite part of the zoo, the stingrays are so friendly and cute. The food is decently priced for what you get, and the reusable cups are very nice and eco-friendly by not needing a straw! There are lids that are given to you for the cups when you pay for your food, and there’s a spot for you to drink out of and it does not leak. The petting zoo is always lots of fun and the zookeepers in there are always very informative and friendly when you ask them questions about the animals. The sea lion and seal show is also very cute! The sea lions are adorable and so is the seal, and it’s very informative, teaching kids lots about the pinnipeds they have at the zoo! 10/10 recommend<//text>

The staff/trainers were extremely knowledgeable and answered all of our questions about the animals. The elephant and white rhino enclosure shown in the first picture is so amazing, it’s like something out of a movie.

All the animals were easy to see and seemed happy in their habitats.

Constantly saw workers doing their best to keep the environment clean and safe.

We even got to see a trainer chat talk about the elephants and show us how they care for them!

We will definitely be going back.</Review></record>

So much to see now that they've been updating and building new areas. The new water play area is a nice place to cool off but to my 5 year old it makes the zoo more about playing in the water rather than about the animals. But a great addition for those with annual memberships looking for a way to cool off in the summer months.</Text>

Such a fun, relaxing place to enjoy animals with the family. Africa is our favorite, with outdoor eating. The dinosaurs were a cute walk through.<//Review>

<review>Zoo is nice. But when it comes to mask wearing and you can't wear one do to medical reasons they don't care. Was told I have to wear one or you can't see certain animals. Well I didn't pay to go there and then be told that. ADA should check them out. If they can't treat everyone the same. Then I'm sorry shut down those areas or make it so people can view them the same. Animals were nice and well taken  care of.</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6<//gmap_id></record>

My kids enjoyed the zoo even though the zoo is under some pretty heavy construction, as a result some of the our favorite zoo exhibits (like the tiger and asian bear) are closed and will be close for a couple years according to zoo employees.<//Review>

<text>Really nice & well kept zoo. It's a good size to spend the day but not too big to where you'll need to rush to see it all. Plenty of trees to shade in the hot valley sun/summer. The parking could use some improvements, it's rather small and undefined. Really appreciated the mom's nursing area.<//text><Time>1563144846201</Time></record>

This zoo is awesome. I love the Africa exhibit.
The last in the food court wasn't super nice so that's why I gave it 4 stars. But all the employees standing around to answer questions were very knowledgeable and informative.<//Text>

Fresno Chaffee Zoo is one of the best zoos to visit in the Central Valley. Animals may be limited; however, the size is great based on the size of the city! The zoo is very clean and organized, where everyone can explore the whole zoo in few hours! Highly recommend visiting Fresno Chaffee Zoo! 👍< /text>

Great zoo . Love the African Safari got to see a lion climb a big rock and stand tall. We will be purchasing member passes next week so we can go back as many times as we want.<//Review>

Absolutely loved our visit. Grew up in Fresno but moved 14 years ago. Last visit was 3 years ago and absolutely amazed how the zoo has changed. Prices are low and worth every penny of the cost to get in. Kids all had a blast. Worth coming to again and again and wish we lived closer to get a membership. The giraffe feeding was awesome.</review>

Overall it is a nice zoo, can be covered in half a day. Need to pay inside for some activities like touching sting ray, seeing dinosaur park, etc. Kids love the dinosaur park, it’s well made.< /Text>

<Review>It is not easy to keep animals in a zoo and still have a natural feel to the show. Fresno Chaffee Zoo does exceedingly well.
Looking at the elephant shaking a palm tree by the water side reminded me of a real wild scene just a couple of miles down from Murchison Falls, Uganda.
Some animals on the resident list were not there, but staff explained the situation.
Great place for a day out!< /Review>< Resp>

Really nice, full featured zoo! Constantly updating and building new and creative exhibits. The Marketing/Promotion Team for the zoo has done an excellent job coming up with ideas to attract visitors all year round. We just went back for our third year of Zoolights where the entire park is adorned in Christmas lights! Take the family and enjoy!< /review>

I have seen many zoos in California and Chaffee is still my favorite. The layout is beautiful, there are a wide variety of animals to observe and the food is delicious. There is seating throughout the park. The zoo also offers a variety of kids activities throughout the year. I highly recommend purchasing a membership, especially if you are a Fresno resident. The membership will also get you discounts at other zoos.< /Review>

If you haven't been to the zoo or you haven't been in a few years... you gotta check it out. Major improvements have been made.

This is the best thing in Fresno.< /Text>

It's been ages since I've been to the zoo. It used to be so boring. But, now the experience has been way better than it was then. I like the safari look, how you get to see animals up close, and the zoo keeps have shows of different animals. The old part of the zoo remixed in with the new, more interactions with animals, and good food. Only thing I didn't like was the parking, but overall it was a great experience seeing all the animals in a safari like theme.<//Text>

One of the best zoos I have ever been to! Large animal habitats and enclosures, such an incredible variety of species, well kept grounds. I spent over 5 hours here and felt like I could easily spend a few more hours!<//Review>

<Review>I took my son on a day trip to Fresno yesterday to the Zoo, mall, dinner and movie...Wow they have done so much with this zoo, we loved it super relaxed not crowded beautiful animals and the absolute stars are their zookeepers!! So personal they talk to you and answer any and all questions you have and are the sweetest people.  One also told me they have special areas for kids and adults with special needs and like my son he is autistic with many sensory issues...i am definitely going to try a trip with him next time.  anyway for the kids to calm down after a meltdown or whatever may be bothering them.  What a plus in my book!! The cafe they have there we ate at is right on the African Adventure very yummy food above what i would expect.  You also can sit right there outside and watch the elephants, rhinos, giraffe etc. while you eat such fun!! The animals are superbly taken care of as well...We truly enjoyed our time there and will most definitely be returning and recommending to friends and family.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbbl_Qr337yhcSW_-48XdIae5-3DnI_O3otfH5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN16a0pVS6Pt0T-QosxbzEZQ-PuVvYqFyWqGCgR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGDLN2NhDp6WV-Xq4FT4CBPwZwm6ZIyc4UcIjW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnBCNHcuyJe1Pd0cyJwF43f3Rw2tBYfxWpEM4b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrkS0dt8kNN4JcaLh5AvzIFW-ZPDk32-BjE5YD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObB553_I_644mgnrC_8VFZSwc5vHzv7A7V2q7D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_3Z1kAYYMwAZRs2vGpmaeoqYqvY2f1EaC0LuH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORYpzNWkqdiWvpuOT9vLyXWBod-VQ04iWEGQ8q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORX40IQHi6ku54tevuCw8gPS9kW8wHoo_reBUV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMB7Qrb1oYxA6LP0sGhRFHIb--ku0n1fylOrxtN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFZ691qOTUUK8NHFb8kPmCJX7NRauWTdY0mOvi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4vfBAJeQbR60jZiJzrhtQYSnSSr0dJ_dBw0WF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBzfoizkIC05yZ1VOAFHU2HcxuKYJFtOmY7N24=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< rating>

Feeding the Giraffes neeeeeever gets old! It's definitely improving but there is still a lot of empty space. Biggest complaint would be the Tiger. I wish it had a bigger set up. It seems way too small for the poor thing.< /Text>

< Review>
Beautiful and well maintained zoo. Lots of space between exhibits to space yourself away from other families. Several outdoor dinning options, hand sanitizer station easliy available and clean restrooms.   The staff was very friendly and helpful for the most part. We did have a very negative experience at the giraffe feeding. The giraffes themselves where awsome. You can get up close to see them. Where it went wrong was the very rude and unhelpful paid staff. They clearly need more training in customer service. It was not organized and no signs to where you should stand or park your stroller. The hand sanitation was placed after the lettuce pick up area so you had to walk to that point then go back to pick up the lettuce. The staff was barking out orders. A few signs and proper placement of items would have made it easier on everyone. At one point we were the only ones in the pavilion so it was not like the staff had a lot to do. It just needs to be better organized so you know what to do. Otherwise the feeding of the giraffes was interesting. The volunteer staff was great. They specifically explained what we should do and told us about the animals.  Overall the zoo was really fun and a great place to spend the day.<//Review>

<Text>The Chaffee Zoo is absolutely BEAUTIFUL! My dance crew, McCoy Hip Hop, performed for Zoobilation and Zoo Lights and we just did not want to leave. We walked around before and after our performances and was just amazed at all of the work that went into the zoo. We also loved how friendly and helpful the zoo staff was. We are looking forward to going back!< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMW4cSKxy5Kjm7UczbjueOvACmsLQMK8JC5kPAt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBbHqJX67mN_W_jQXPnazp_7e1oEGoQangFqPc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfTU0tmBuqlQUj6hVh2gDNvKbmnTOIB7YVs1ch=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

It was also super nice they give out free water cups because I got my son a juice but all I wanted was to down some water haha the hands on exhibits like the sting Ray's and giraffes were not pricey at all and my son enjoyed them!!! Can't wait to visit again!< /review>< Pics>

There was a lot of construction going on that will likely not end any time soon & because of Covid you have to walk down a preset path. The Reptile exhibit is closed and a lot of the animals have been "relocated" to another exhibit that they're working on. Unfortunately those exhibits are all closed so we didn't get to see about a third of the animals.
Overall, it was still a fun experience and the lack of people made for a more enjoyable experience.</Text>

The zoo has improved so much. The animals have much more room for themselves. And for the first who visit now have a beautiful dinning/lounge area in the Africa Adventure section of the zoo.<//Review>

<review>The animals also look semi free since there is so much space in that enclosure. I also love the events they have.< /review>< Time>

Honestly, the zoo is average, usually. On this time visiting, I saw the dinosaur exhibit, which was a nice change of pace. Also, word of advice, visit the seals and sea lions last, it's a great place to cool down in the heat and you can see under the water.</review>

< Review>
My family loves the local zoo. It's not as big as sa San Diego Wild Animal park, but you can feed the giraffes and stingrays! It's usually not overly crowded  and its completely possible to see the entire pack, shows included, in a single day. My favorite time of year to go is actually December.  They have an event called Zoolights. The entire park is decked out in Christmas lights, Santa Claus is available for secret sharing and picture taking and there is even FREE hot chocolate handed out during the event! Dont forget to stop by their food shack for some of the best soft pretzels around.  All and all, we love Fresno Chaffee Zoo!</Review>

Really great place to go for a nice day out with the kids or on a date with your partner. The staff is really friendly and the animals look well taken care of. Make sure to bring sunscreen and lots of water on your visit. The new safari exhibit is really great. Although it can't compete with the San Diego Zoo and Safari park, the Chaffee Zoo is something great that everyone in Fresno should visit every once in a while.</review>

< Review>
This zoo is awesome. I love the Africa exhibit.
The last in the food court wasn't super nice so that's why I gave it 4 stars. But all the employees standing around to answer questions were very knowledgeable and informative.<//Review>

Its a great zoo seems like the city should give them more land for a better facility and it felt a little empty since some exhibits were closed and being replaced, but the dinosaur section was great my wife and kids loved it.<//Text>

Kids loved it walked around for about 3 hours. Make sure you spray yourself with bug repellant. My baby got bites all over her legs.< /review>

So proud to have this in Fresno. If you are visiting, go now...and take the kids. Price is so reasonable. The new exhibits are breathtaking. Feed the giraffes. Pet the sting rays. Go to the petting zoo. If you're local, send your kids to the summer camps. So glad to see my tax dollars put to great use.
Just go.<//Text>

A bit disappointing but didnt expect much otherwise. Pretty much you can only visit outdoor sections due to covid. shame that they make you pay extra for some exhibits, its not that big of a zoo in the first place. the elephant giraffe rhino areas were nice. otherwise wasn't anything overly exciting. The sea lion area seems like a huge section what a waste of space for the 1-2 sea lions hiding swimming in the corner. There was very little or unclear signage of where to go and what to do anywhere in the zoo and they dont even hand you a map when you walk in.<//Review>

<review>place was PACKED, parking sucked($5 for parking/entering area) had to walk like 7 minutes to get to zoo area but zoo was fun and we had a blast. African Adventure was pretty cool.  $10 entry fee is not to bad. Go on a weekday less people, more parking space!<//review>< pictures>

Fresno Chaffee Zoo is an awesome place to take the kids and have a relaxing day. There are many animals here to see and you can even put your hands in the water to pet the sharks and stingrays. They also have an area for the kids to get wet and cool down. It is very big so if you want to try and see everything you need to get there early.  I definitely would recommend the Fresno Zoo to others.< /text>

<Review>Great zoo. The animal enclosures are big enough. Was really impressed with the indoor Reptile House - which should probably be renamed as reptile and amphibian house or the herp house as it would be more apt to the animals on display. Anyway, rich variety of reptiles and exotic amphibs, mainly frogs. It's a fun area to play "who can spot the animal first".  =)<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Been almost 10 years since I went to tge zoo and got see all the brand new things they had which were nice! One thing i didnt like was that i saw alot of people not wearing masks and the zoo employees not doing nothing to inforce the rules! Also didnt like how some attractions were closed due to covid and they were still chargin full price! Looking forward to the new attractions in 2021 but wont go untill covid is over with not worth my life!!!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The lines seem really long when you arrive for them, but they move them along quickly. Very friendly, my daughter had a balloon, and they held it at the front for her while we went inside, since it wasn't  allowed inside.

Normally it isn't too crowded on weekdays, and it's a favorite of mine to take my kids on a weekday and enjoy the restaurant next the the African Adventure area... the prices are a little high for the food, but it's still good.<//text>< rating>

The area was beautiful and very nice exhibits but you cant take a stroller through the buildings and the extra areas so if you bring kids in a stroller dont expect to see it all.< /Text>

We touched stingrays & got to feed the giraffes & played with goats in the farm animal area. Finished our day with lunch at the lounge which gives a beautiful scenic view of lush African landscape. It was a day not only my granddaughter will cherish but us as well- so glad we became members cause we will definitely be coming back.

Through Measure Z, the Chaffee Zoo has been able to improve and expand the zoo to make it a quality experience. The new Africa exhibit is really nicely done and the Kopje Lodge has decent food for moderate prices. If you live in the area and have kids or just like having somewhere to go wander I would suggest getting a year pass, it pays for itself in 7 trips. Great place to go for dates without spending a ton of money. Pro tip: If you want to go when it is less crowded, go in to morning. The animals are also more active. During the summer, always go as soon as it opens, before it gets hot.<//Review><rating>5</rating>< gmap_id>

The zoo itself is wonderful!  The people that allow their children to toss their trash wherever they want should be fined.  I picked up in  three separate places food wrappers and soda bottles.< /Text>

<text>Nice little zoo. Lots to see. The animals look well cared for. There are staff/zookeeper talks throughout the zoo where you can witness feedings, learn about them and ask questions. We enjoyed experiencing touching the sting rays and sharks as well as feeding the giraffes. Loved the elephant enclosure, which is mixed with other animals like zebras and rhinos where they have a large area to roam. There's also a splash pad for the kids because it's hot in California!< /text>< pictures>

It’s a zoo and it has amazing habitats for the animals. You should definitely check this one out. They also added a dinosaur habitat.< /Review>

Always AMAZING visiting our local zoo. Our family loves how they always add new things to keep us coming back. Food is always delicious and I personally think it priced very reasonable.</review>

<user>105777706480109008051</user><Time>1510628668230</Time><Review>Variety of different animals.  Land, air and water. Great food at reasonable prices. Also new exhibits opening soon.  I took my daughter and she loved it, especially the walk thru habitats and of course the monkeys.  I loved how parts of the zoo was separated, as in an Africa exhibit with animals from there same with an Asia, Australian and rainforest sections. I'm posting pictures I wish I got more and better ones like my girl did but.....sorry.  ENJOY< /Review></record>

It was a pretty warm day in the valley today, but that didn't stop us from visiting the zoo. The only exhibit that was closed was the Reptile House, which I wasn't too sad about (lol don't like snakes). It was exceptionally clean, the staff was super nice and friendly. There were possibly 2 habitats that didn't have animals (sick/injured animal I believe or just being moved). It always brings back memories coming here and I'm glad we came today to support the zoo and see all the wonderful exhibits and animals. Oh and the African Zoofari is AMAZING. Oh and for $3 you can even feed the giraffes 🦒 😊.</Text>

The African savannah exhibit is incredible - I’ve never been to a zoo where there’s so much open space for savannah creatures to enjoy with other species. I’ve been on a couple private tours in the reptile hut (family connection and through UCSF wilderness med course) and it gets better and better each time. I’d give 6 stars as you can feed the giraffes for a nominal fee.</text>

Well done zoo and displays for this metro area, and great dining area overlooking African savannah  and animals; very friendly staff. Parking bit convoluted, bit of a walk, but only $5.<//review>

<Review>This zoo is amazing. Located in a weird part of Fresno but it is always a hit with the kids. Animals and displays are worth every penny. Our family purchases a season pass every year and we go once a month. It is regularly expanding and adding new exhibits, including an amazing Africa exhibit. Food is good but over priced. The extras (Zoo Lights, Zoo Boo, etc) are always fun.</Review>< pictures>

It's a great little zoo, they're always trying to find new ways to keep you conning back. The petting zoo is free and the sting ray area only costs $2! It's a great area to bring little ones and the keepers will answer all your random questions about the animals.< /Text>

Friendly staff! They'll always treat you with respect and will help you to the best of their ability . 10/10. Strongly suggest going and checking out the animals when you get the chance, they're cute & are well taken care of.< /Text>

Well done zoo and displays for this metro area, and great dining area overlooking African savannah  and animals; very friendly staff. Parking bit convoluted, bit of a walk, but only $5.< /review>

<Text>For the price of admission, this is a great way to spend the day. We prefer the SF Zoo for the playgrounds and more variety of animals, but it also much pricier. I definitely recommend the Fresno Chaffee Zoo.

<review>The place is well kept. Maintain in manner where the animals doesn't seem to be mis-treated. In a nice loaction next to a park with lake. You and the family can have a picnic and go to the zoo at the same time.< /review></record>

<Review>First time at this zoo and we went on a whim. Super clean, and was not crowded for a Saturday! The food was surprisingly delicious! And for the cost to get in, the price for our lunch was very decent. My 5 year old loved it and was entertained all day. Definitely coming back!< /Review>< Pics>

The best zoo I've been to out of the five in central California/ bay area/ Sacramento.  I've never been that close to the more exotic animals. Really amazing..very clean..prices beat all other zoos..only complaint was it was hard to navigate..even with map..had to retrace steps to missed exhibits.. everyone seemed to be stopping one another to ask where they can find such and such.. I had to bow out last hour from being wiped out.. so plan and rest accordingly.. but hands down WONDERFUL<//text>

A very nice sized zoo to spend the afternoon or even a few hours. Key areas to make sure to visit are the sea lion habitat, ray petting area, feed the giraffes, and walk through the large reptile house. Parking can fill up quickly, so arriving closer to opening may make that easier. Lots of feedings throughout the day along with the shows with different animals make this a recommended zoo to visit.</Text>

The zoo was clean and inviting. Hand sanitizer stations throughout the zoo. All staff was wearing masks in response to the covid19 virus. Gift shops had merchandise outside for purchase. Food was available for outside dining. I look forward to going back.</Review>

Currently many exibits under construction. They have additional charges to get in to see parts of the zoo after you paid at the gate to enter. Gets pricy for families, but great for the kids.</Text>

I love this zoo. The exhibits here just get better and better. The African animal exhibit is wonderful. Be sure to go feed a giraffe! Which reminds me, the giraffe handlers were very snarky and rude to me and my family when we last visited. I didn't like our treatment from them. Everyone else was great. If you ever get a chance to go to a special event that allows you behind the scenes, absolutely go for it. I've been in their on site vet clinic and it's great to see the equipment they use.<//review>

How could you not give this place 5☆. They are constantly renovating and upgrading every corner and nook making it even better than it already is. They offer a little something for every age.  I am married without kids and we go atleast every 6 weeks. They are constantly hosting after hours events introducing the community to something new and exciting,  such as the Roar and Pour a few months back!< /Review>

Fresno Chaffee Zoo is a wonderful family destination.  The zoo is much improved over the last ten years. If you are local and plan to go often check into a annual membership.< /review>

Staff did a great job of answering questions and very friendly. There have been a lot of good changes made since last time I was there. The water area it's a great addition. The only issue I had was the overall look. Wasn't as kept up maintenance wise as the last time I was there and I think security should be a little more stringent. For the price, it is a good family experience. If I could give 4 1/2 starts I would.<//text>

Awesome experience over all, however I was bummed to pay more for some exhibits after already paying the entry fee. The construction was a bummer too, but I get it has to happen for more exhibits.</text>

It is the fastest-growing zoo in the nation and it has some marine animals like seals and stingrays you can touch, it has an amazing open space for African safari that resembles the San Diego Safari Landscaping where animals roam freely around a beautiful Lake. We fed the giraffes and got to learn so much from zookeepers! We definitely will be back many more times, got the membership which provides a lot of benefits like 10% discounts in the cafe and gift shop and preview events. having been to huge zoos like San Diego Zoo and San Diego Safari in the Los Angeles Zoo, we were surprised beyond our expectation at this beautiful and well-kept Zoo. It has so much to Explore! Oh, before I forget. My kids also spent a good hour digging in the dino dig, it was actually really fun to unearth bone and to get a real feeling of what it would be like being part of it fossil Expedition team.<//text></record>

Love the Fresno zoo, the staff is always amazing and with all the Covid-19 stuff going on right now they are still finding ways to entertain and engage my kids, like with the virtual zoo camp. Definitely recommend supporting the zoo in any way you can.</review>

It was just to hot lol. They should have missters around to cool off . I couldn't find a couple places that i paid for I just got a little sick from the heat . I had to sit down for a min. They should have a couple of staff checking on ppl my age to see if their ok. I couldn't find the exit for a min. there went in circles cause of the way I was feeling. Just suggestion .< /Text>

<text>Worth the time and money to check out this zoo. It’s right off the freeway, and huge parking lot but may need to walk a while to get inside the zoo. It’s located within the Roeding Park so a gate fee is assessed upon entering.  The exhibits are well kept and there are plenty of species to see while you’re here.  The African safari area is very well done and really immerses you in the atmosphere. Be sure to wear comfy walking shoes and bring plenty of water bottles!< /text><name>Shaun Edwards</name></record></dataset><record>

Is a pretty place, nice with vegetation everywhere, even enjoyable during hottest days. Fair entance fee for what you can do. They do a fun Bird Show, perfect for the little ones and who loves animals. Birds are gorgeous. You can also feed Jiraffs! 😍 and talk with the animals' keepers about their habitat and characteristics of each animal.<//review>

<review>July 13 2019 I took my mom to the zoo for her birthday this morning/afternoon other then the extremely RUDE girls at the giraffe platform we had fun exploring and seeing all the beautiful animals and Dinosaurs. A zookeeper named Brandon who was visiting on his day off was very sweet and helped us find our way around the safari also Misha in the Lion area was amazing and taught us some very cool things about the big cats over all we had fun and hope to return very soon ! Thanks so much for a fun filled afternoon Fresno Chaffee Employees and Partners !< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Be sure to go feed a giraffe! Which reminds me, the giraffe handlers were very snarky and rude to me and my family when we last visited. I didn't like our treatment from them. Everyone else was great. If you ever get a chance to go to a special event that allows you behind the scenes, absolutely go for it. I've been in their on site vet clinic and it's great to see the equipment they use.<//Text>< rate>

We took our youth girls group, from our church, and they had a blast. The animal exhibits are really cool, and the staff is entirely friendly and helpful. We all loved it!! Thank you, Fresno Chaffee Zoo!! 🐘🐼</Review>

Such a beautiful zoo and the new African safari is AHMAZING! A must see. We spend anywhere from 2-4hrs here with our kids. So many new features have been added and the zoo just keeps getting better each year. They’ve even added a water feature. Which living in Fresno is a must.

Our favorite memories are visiting the zoo during the holidays. Lots of fun events to attend. Our most recent was zoo lights!

If you are new to the area or just visiting you need to come check it out!</Text>

<Review>I have a large family so we decided to go with the annual pass which has saved us so much money already. It’s a great buy I suggest anyone who plans on going to the zoo more than once a year should definitely purchase an annual pass. The food is not so pricey. They have been adding more things I personally love going to Stingray bay and they have sharks too. With the annual pass you get into stingray bay free just pay the $1 for feeding if option available. Great place for family outings.<//Review>< pics>

It's a decent size Zoo it took about 4 hours to see every exhibit. We did the special they had where we got to touch the sting rays and feed the giraffes.<//text>

<Text>Zoo lights was amazing. My first time there and I was so excited to see what it was all about. I was told we were going to see Santa and take pictures, I was excited. As we arrived, there was no parking so we were dropped at he front gates to wait in line. The line moved pretty fast so by the time he parked the car, we were up front.
As you go into the gates, it's all lit up. There were different characters and animals made from lights. Scenes made from cartoons cutouts and those were dressed with lights. It was absolutely beautiful. Sea Lion Cove was equally as beautiful, I dont remember much of what it look liked because I was ambushed by a mob of family and friends....I was proposed to that night, zoo lights will always be special in my heart.  #BerberCoronadoWedding2019</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAr1qANkALF-APjZOSEdYW2ptP7wR1zCRn36uw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7qUdInJAy174NmbfeA7VaF5Aiens-eYHYSXyH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhG3r3tL4aFxp5-tGKP8pKdrZIrWINCnsQwL39=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>I didn't think I would enjoy this zoo, I usually end up seeing animals in tiny enclosures that look sad, but all the animals here seem loved and we'll looked after. My two friends an I had a great time! The staff was so nice to us and some asked us questions about Pokémon Go and was just over all really friendly and welcoming. We saw multiple shows in the zoo that were fun and educational, each show took time after to answer questions with the animals and audience. It's nice they let you know what your donation is going toward too. The food is pretty good and really decently priced, we paid like 10$ to feed 3 people and bought the refillable cup. Highly reccomend the member pass for the price. My husband and I will be buying the family pass and returning in future weekends.<//Text>< Pictures>

<user>116321601132576957822<//user><Review>Love, love love Fresno Chaffee Zoo. This oasis just off 99 and Olive (or Belmont) is a real joy to see - repeatedly. As Fresno has grown, the zoo has grown in size, quality, and aesthetics. It's a landmark worthy of being proud of our city. While it is not what I would call inexpensive, it IS a great value for your dollar and should be considered a special biannual or quarterly special treat for the kids (and you). Both exciting AND exhausting, plan for lunch (and rest) at the Kopje Lodge (great food choices), the Safari Cafe, or bring your own picnic. To see the whole zoo requires a LOT of walking so try to plan your visit where you land at food/rest at appropriate times. Highly recommend.</Review><name>Bryan LeGare< /name><gmap_id>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6<//gmap_id><Response>None<//Response></record>

Best place for the whole family year round!! The animals are all healthy and well cared for. The grounds are kept clean and free of hazards! Super easy to push our stroller wherever needed! Great hands on kid areas for our 2 year old. Been coming here for years and they just keep improving! 10/10 would recommend< /review>

<Review>They didn't have very many animals. The elephants were to far away to see trying to get into there enclosure. My favorite part was the dinosaur exhibit.

Always enjoy my time here. Only reason I didnt give 5 stars is the restrooms do need some TLC. Rust and paint chips everywhere. But everything else is an awesome experience!< /Review>

Have a membership here.  The new exhibit is fantastic! During the school year I  recommend going on a weekday after 1pm.  Everytime we visit there are more changes, such as moving animals into larger exhibits.<//Text>

Such a beautiful zoo and the new African safari is AHMAZING! A must see. We spend anywhere from 2-4hrs here with our kids. So many new features have been added and the zoo just keeps getting better each year. They’ve even added a water feature. Which living in Fresno is a must.

Our favorite memories are visiting the zoo during the holidays. Lots of fun events to attend. Our most recent was zoo lights!

If you are new to the area or just visiting you need to come check it out!< /text>

While the entrance is not fancy you quickly find out it drops you directly into the action. I beautiful walk through tropical bird environment that thrills children and adults alike. Moving on to the elephants you are sill thinking this is a standard zoo adventure until you come out on the Savanna. 40 acres of beautiful environment designed so well you don't notice the barriers between the hunters and the prey. Off in the distance a herd of elephants sways while different antelope types wander and occasionally bound through. A pride of lions sits to one side. Lounging on rocks and lording it over all, cubs playing and lionesses watching over them. A rhinoceros wanders through with her baby at her side. Amazing everyone. Next is on to the giant enclosed tropical rain forest complete with waterfall and fowl of all types. The zoo in Fresno is well worth the visit. If you in town at loose ends or looking for something on the weekend to do with yourself or the family. You can't lose with this one.</Text>

This was the first time at the Fresno Zoo. I was impressed they had riding carts for the disabled because there was no was I could have done it in my wheel chair. It was an amazing experience with my family. I like it better than the Sacramento Zoo.<//text>

<text>Brought my Family from the Bay Area to checkout this Zoo and they loved it so much. The Fresno Chaffee Zoo has improved so much over the years its mind blowing, the African animal Exhibit is the masterpiece that this Zoo needed and finally got.

The zoo was clean and inviting. Hand sanitizer stations throughout the zoo. All staff was wearing masks in response to the covid19 virus. Gift shops had merchandise outside for purchase. Food was available for outside dining. I look forward to going back.</Review>

<text>What a fantastic zoo! As you can see from the images and video, the animals were active and very interested in our presence. My children were able to see everything up close and in person. Further, he was not congested and the park was kept very clean. Can’t wait to go back!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Overprice everything was closed after the animals were done eating early at 4:15 so we missed everything we got there at 3:30 but animals were very thin to where you can see their ribs overall it would be a great experience once everything is completed and not under construction and a lot of animals were missing<//text>

<text>They don't really have a big selection of animals to look at.We couldn't see a good hand full of them because the animals weren't let out or the animals spaces were being cleaned. Food and items are pricey as expected in any park. What I didn't expect is to pay for a second admission just to see the dinosaur exhibit inside the same park. And most of the staff were nice that is until I got to the seal training. The lady that talks through the hole show was genuinely bothered that my 3 year old was walking around while she was talking. So once he tossed a water bottle to my niece. She was like"don't throw objects and have a seat bud. It's distracting to everyone." But she was the only one who seemed distracted by it. But what she had said wasn't the problem the true problem was she rolled her eyes and shook her head as in disbelief that a 3 year can't sit still. Hello it's a zoo were people take their kids to see animals my 3 year old son is not the first nor the last child that won't be able to sit still. I just think if your going to work where there's kids you just have learn to work though it and be patient.< /text>< Date>

What an amazing job Chaffee has been doing in creating beautiful, natural looking spaces. And as usual, it's wonderful to see some of these creatures... a poor man's photo Safari... that otherwise one can only see on screens or pages. Add to that the knowledge shared by the docents and other zoo staff and it makes an amazing outing. And to top it all off, the work done by zoos saving the last survivors of some species is invaluable.< /text>

<Text>You got to have more training & shows going on than just The Bird Show all the time that's the same old thing I seen since I was young and what happened to all of those little guide boxes/digital educational boxes throughout the park. Yeah, they would read to you the information and give you a lot of cool info & details about the animals. I think for the most part that if y'all get a tiger show going on it would be awesome & attract more people from out of state & around-the-world even!</Text>< pictures>

Love the cafe there that overlooks the African exhibit. My 2 year old son had so much fun feeding the elephants. Highly recommend. Not 5 stars because there weren't really any kiddie rides or activities.<//text>

$75 a year for our yearly zoo membership! My aunt bought our family membership last Christmas and it's definitely been the best present ever! We've had blast and even if our membership isn't gifted to us this Christmas, we couldnt imagine going without. Definitely worth the investment.<//Text>

As a child I was taken to the zoo a lot and now that I have a kid of my own I try to do the same. Sadly it doesn’t feel as fun as it used to. The tiger is definitely in distress and it hurts my heart.
The new water park area is fun and of course the new African Adventure area is beautiful! The food is a tad overpriced but that’s nothing out of the normal. Overall we have a great time! If my sons happy I’m happy.< /review>

Their bright yellow and bluish/purplish colors were so beautiful. We also had a fun time feeding the giraffe and petting the goats. The place was clean and the personnel were friendly and helpful. The walk around the park was very pleasant and enjoyable. The weather was temperate that added more to trees that abundantly inhabited the place.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<date>1573355046681</date><rating>5< /rating><Review>I have lived in Fresno all my life and watched the Roeding Park Zoo transform into the Chaffee Zoo. This is a zoo the people of Fresno can be proud of. I hadn't been in a few years and was amazed at how big the Zoo has gotten. The exhibits are spacious and there's lots of spots to sit in the shade. Parking is free and limited close to the entrance. You might have to walk a bit from where you park to get in during the weekends. But worth it.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>It's great! Plenty of animals such as elephants, rhinos, tortoises, cheetahs and more. 2 places to eat inside. I've only stopped by the cafe which isn't overly pricey for a quick snack. Love that at $12 a person it's still affordable for us locals and of course the expansions are great!<//text>< response>

I lived in San Diego (the world famous zoo) for a long spell, and even with that, I was still very pleased with Fresno's zoo. Many vivid colored animals I'd not seen before and such fun watching monkeys swing and carry the young ones. For eats, gluten free vegetarians can get a salad...but little else at the cafe near the safari. Nice way to spend a few hours.</review>

<Text>Awesome zoo for a small City like Fresno. Awesome zoo. They are constantly trying to make it a better place for the animals and a super experience for the public. Tickets aren't too bad, but if you want to go back more than once a year it really pays to get a membership! Then you can go as often as you please and you get discounts in the gift stores and I think even on food, but don't hold me to the food. There is so much to see and experience and learn! Special places for kids and lots of benches to just sit and enjoy. If you like animals you have to check this place out!<//Text>< user_id>

Great zoo! The Africa section and tropical bird section were out favorites. Our kids (1 and 6) loved being so close to the animals.  They fed a giraffe and stood within feet of tiny monkeys that weren't behind bars.  Amazing!  I cant wait to come back.< /text>

<time>1592015977494</time><Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Never been more disappointed.  I haven't left my home since March 20th due to the coronavirus quarantine, and I did today to go to the zoo!  Before I arrived I was under the impression that anyone over the age of 12 would be required to wear a face mask while there.  Once I entered the gates to the zoo it was quite a surprise when over 95% of the people in the zoo had no face mask what so ever, and it was not being enforced.  In fact, even some of the staff of the zoo had masks on yet were pulled down under their chins.  The fact that the Fresno Chaffee Zoo would encourage large groups of people to gather, with children, without any sort of protection during the time of a pandemic  is quite shocking to me and makes me question whether or not i should continue to support them financially.   They are willing to accept peoples money, and potentially risks hundreds of peoples of lives when all they had to do was enforce a mask police.  If Costco can do it, why can't they?  For me, I will be seeing about getting a refund on my membership, I don't want to fund a zoo that only worries about the dollars and not about its patrons.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I think this zoo is so well designed, it is one of the best zoos I've been too, even if it's a little on the smaller side. The African Savannah section is sooo well done! You feel like you're on a safari! The restaurant in that section is also really reasonably priced, and I love the garlic fries. Other highlights for me are the kangaroo walk, the stingray petting and feeding, and the rainforest walkthrough. Oh, and the sea lions are great as well. This is a zoo that I want to keep coming back to.</Text>

<text>So much fun! I hadn't been to this zoo in 10 years and so much has changed.  They have done some amazing improvements and additions. It is very affordable and a great time for all ages.  The exhibits are all well done and you can easily view the animals.  There are also two great locations to eat delicious food at affordable prices.</text>< pics>

<text>Came here with my family on an off day. It was an awesome trip to this zoo! They have a good variety of animals and reptiles. Animals look well taken care of. Admission, parking, and even food are of reasonable cost. My toddler son really enjoyed seeing reptiles, orangutans, elephants, and rhinos. He also had a blast in the Dino Dig area. Was a great experience and will come back. Some friends say it's the best zoo around(better than Oakland and SF).

As for the negatives reviews below.
1. Prices. This place is NOT that expensive 😂. Money goes to caring for the animals and employees. If PRICES are an issue then go park or stay home
2. Animals. Many of these animals are endangered or wouldn't last in the wild. They are well taken care of and in a clean environment.
3. Parking. Parking DOES stink!! I agree on that but arrive early then.</text>< response>

<Text>ZooBoo (19 OCT 2019 // I arrived at 4pm to about 8pm)
Would not recommend. Would not go again.
I didn't know what to expect at first. My impression was hopeful them dreadful. None of the animals were out. My group of kids literally got 3 pieces of candy in total. Some areas had huge lines. Some places didn’t give candy but rather coupons. Very little decorations for Halloween theme.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Amazing zoo.  If you haven't seen the new African exibit, then you need to go back to the zoo and check it out.  You can get a close look at leopards, lions, and tigers. You can feed a giraffe, and walk around with kangaroos. It is an amazing zoo experience where the animals have a great environment to live in.< /text>

I have gone to the Fresno Chaffee Zoo since I started college in the early seventies and seen how it has grown and improved into one of the best Zoos to visit. Our family has been members since my children were born and now it is a favorite family event with my grandchildren.  When I was young, the San Diego Zoo was a frequent event so I grew up loving the experience. The Fresno Chaffee Zoo is easier to experience in a day and an extremely memorable experience with special events and exhibits throughout the year. It's well worth visiting.

Visiting Zoos elsewhere in the Nation is something we have done over the years so I have seen some wonderful ones elsewhere, like Atlanta, Georgia and Portland. Each one has unique things and this Zoo does as well.<//Text>

Chaffee is a great zoo, however, I was very disappointed after getting there only to go d out that about half their zoo was empty due to creating new exhibits for the future.< /Text>

<text>Great Dino exhibit! Feeding the giraffes was so fun and my kids had the best time. We wrapped up the day at the splash pad. We come here often and appreciate all the work they are putting into this zoo. We loved it and it’s our favorite zoo. Not too small but not too overwhelming like other zoos. Can’t wait to be back !!<//text></record>

One of the best places to go with the kids in Fresno. The African area is pretty amazing.... Even better than some high city zoos I've been to.</Text>

While fun, it's not exactly something I would get excited about. I was completely amazed by the huge improvements they've made there. The Africa exhibit is spectacular and getting a chance to feed the giraffes was super cool. Was not expecting anything close to this level especially here in Fresno. They did a great job on their food concessions too. Great variety and really good too. Again something I wasn't expecting and now a viable lunch/dinner option for the family. If you haven't been here in a while, check it out and prepare to be wowed.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6</gmapID></record>

Chaffee Zoo is one of the greatest family spots in Fresno. Good for everyone or even for an afternoon date. Even on a weekend day, it isn't unreasonably packed.</text>

July the 3rd, Friday, 2020....as the morning sun rose in the east, the Fresno Chaffee Zoo was ready for the visitors of the day.  Even though the Covid-19 cloud hung over Fresno County, the zoo was well prepared for this problem.  The animals didn't seem to mind that the people observing them had on masks and werepracticing social distancing.  They were content with their food and well maintained enclosures.  For the observing humans, there were plenty of hand sanitizer stations found across the grounds of the zoo. Granted the zoo had to close a few of the enclosed exhibits because of the "19" mandates, but the personal of the zoo had great presence and we think there were smiles beneath their masks.  Questions were always answered, and often you came away with more information then your question was asked about.  The zoo has come a long way since this person visited it when Nosey was still in her enclosure. So if you have not seen the Chaffee Zoo in 10 years or more, take some time out of your schedule, and if necessary,  put on a mask and stroll through a wonderful zoo. Hopefully in a few months the mask will not be necessary.  Enjoy...< /Text>

Oh, and feeding stingrays is something you gotta try, feels like a slimy, kinda prickly vacuum sliding over your hand very gently... It's weird for sure, but so fun to have them glide through the water, slurp up the food and keep on it's way.</Review>< pictures>

<review>Fresno Chaffee is always a great time for me and my family. They are continually improving, adjusting exhibits, adding animals and experiences, so that each visit has a good mix of familiar and new. It's great any time of the year. The food is a little overpriced, but you expect that. The animals are clearly week taken care of, and conservation is important to the entire operation.< /review>< resp>

This is a great zoo! Our favorite parts are feeding giraffes and petting stingrays. Giraffe feeding is a couple of dollars and petting stingrays is a bit more but you can get in for free with annual passes. You do pay for parking but it's only about $5. Get there right when it opens for a great spot. There are tons of great features and you definitely won't see everything in one day. Bring water and snacks for sure. Sunscreen up to. There are some places that aren't shady!</review>

My favorite zoo in California. Not too big (if you've got little ones) but not too small (you do get your $$$ worth). Can't wait to come back in 2021 when they add even more stuff.< /Text>

Very crowded today as it was a school holiday but the parking lot full was a clue to how much people here love their zoo and for good reason.  Clean and well staffed.  The exhibits tend to the open and expansive almost as if one were not in a zoo at all.  The Africa display was particularly impressive.

It's worth an extra day even if your ultimate destination is Yosemite -- yes I think it's that good.</text>< user_id>

Best getaway in Fresno. We have our membership and run away to here at least 3 times a week to keep the kiddos educated active and cool in the heat. There's so much shade everywhere and somehow feels 10 degrees cooler in the heat of Summer. They did such a good job with the new additions/improvements, and it's only getting better!</text>

We have a family membership and it has been a great value. We have a great Zoo which is only getting better. Recently too some family who were visiting from Hawaii and they had a great time and were extremely impressed with the Zoo they want to make it a regular activity when they fly over. I went to the Zoo as a child and am very proud of the improvements they have made locally to the Zoo as well as the conservation efforts they are now a part of.< /text>

Prices of the tickets was fair. However... It took an hour to pay and find a parking spot! Absolutely ridiculous, they really need to address this issue. Fix the parking issue and you get 4 stars.<//review>< gmap_id>

They are undergoing some construction for more exhibits, but there is still plenty to do and see! Our favorite exhibit is the stingray pool! Pet huge rays and sharks!

It always seems to be hot when I go, but I always find that it is all worth it. I’m really glad to see that they are expanding many parts of the zoo for larger exhibits. There’s also a baby rhino and a baby orangutan that made me feel again.
Kangaroos are still superior</Text>

<review>So fun and so much to see. Park rangers all around to answer any questions. Prices are very good. Where we are wasn't ridiculously overpriced. I was very pleasantly surprised. Drive up from Gilroy to take our 3 year old grandson who had a blast!! The reptile house and of course the dinosaurs!!< /review></record></dataset><record>

Kids always love it. Love that they are always adding to it also- totally worth the extra in taxes. Cheap annual pass ($90 a year for our family as fresno county residents) The new mini water park/play area is a HUGE hit with the kids for our sweltering summers. There can be a shortage of tables for the parents to sit while the kids play so get there early if possible< /Text>

I have been to zoo's across America, but have never been so informed about the animals and the behind the scenes activities and care that must take place for the animals to remain healthy and active. A wonderful experience made all the better thanks to Linda. Be sure to spend a day, or two, when in Fresno, Ca.<//review>< pictures>

Being born and raised in Fresno I have been going to the Fresno Chaffee Zoo for years. It is so nice to see how it has evolved. There are so many wonderful attractions. Stingray Bay where you can actually pet a stingray. The seal exhibit that allows you to not only watch the seals and sea lions frolic and jump out of the water you can walk down to the underwater level and watch them swimming. The African Adventure was so well done. It is expansive with lots of room for the animals to roam.<//review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Hands down the best zoo on the west coast! From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave a jungle based nature is present. My god kids love this place. The amount of exotic animals present is surreal. The pictures don’t even scratch the surface on how awesome this zoo really is. I love the detail placed here. The kids had a blast, but I can say I might’ve enjoyed the experience just as much.

Feeding the animals was a large part of our day. They are so friendly. The staff is very aware and alert. They know the animals so well. I was very pleased with the pictures I was able to get with the animals so close. Feeding the animals really creates the want to feed yourself. The food spots spread out across the zoo does the tummy right. They have proper meals for both adults and children.

A must see is the giraffes. The line to view them was amazing. They really capture the attention of everyone. Money very well spent for a full day at the zoo with the little ones. Will certainly return in the near future to stay informed on new additions to the zoo family.<//Text>< user_name>

<Review>Seems they are renovating or adding new stuff. One or two exhibits are closed, a few others are detoured a bit, but nothing unbearable. My son is the best tour guide I could ask for. I recommend buying the family pass as it pays for itself in just 2 or 3 visits. It's nice to be able to run over after school for an hour to kill time and not have to pay admission for such a short time frame.< /Review><user>105107880560091869295<//user>< GmapID>

I love our zoo! We're so lucky to have this in our area. It's always a great day when we come here. We love the new wilderness falls and the African safari area too. The new kangaroo walkabout lets you really get up close and personal with the kangaroos! It's a learning adventure every single time.< /review>

<review>Going always makes me sad and happy. Happy to see the animals, sad that they have to be locked up. Its ironic, humans putting animals in cages to protect them from humans.. In a perfect world, zoos wouldn't need to exist. But I'm at least happy some species of animals are still around because of them.<//review></record>

<Text>So much fun to see the animals.  It's great how they have workers periodically throughout the Zoo to explain the animals nature and habitat.  A learning experience for the kids and some Adults. My granddaughter wants to work with animals and that just peaked her interest even more. Great job Chaffee Zoo.< /Text>< pictures>

Great place to take the kid for a couple of hours.  I've always had membership to any zoo in a city I've lived.  I'm used to San Diego zoo so this zoo doesn't compare but always nice to have zoo nearby and I'm glad to have Fresno zoo nearby.<//review>

In all my adult life I've never been to a zoo and i had so much fun! I love cats so I especially enjoyed seeing the "big cats" ! Watching the handler talk, discuss and train with the tiger was amazing!< /text>

<review>The dinosaur experience is amazing and so lifelike. We went to my nieces birthday party because she loves dinosaurs. They have a whole party area set up with a mini dinosaurs dig, dinosaurs as decorations. The works. You even get to walk through the Jurassic area with the dinosaurs and they move. Scared the bejesus out of my 2 year old. It was so much fun.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

The flamingos and the rhinos are my favorites. The flamingos for their delicateness as well as their color; the rhinos for their thickness as well as their practical lack of color. Wonderful zoo.</Review>

They really need to add those big shade covers over the African adventure walkways.  It wouldnt be hard to do.  Adding poles and extending the shade covers over the walkways.  It gets so hot and I've seen numerous people get drained by the amount of direct sunlight in this area.  Just a thought to help their guests last longer throughout their zoo experience.< /Text>

Fresno Chaffee Zoo has improved over the years and I love the beautiful grounds and fun stingray pool that the kiddos can play and interact with. I am so happy that there have been so many wonderful renovations because I remember going to the zoo over 40 years ago as a child and it's nice to see it has improved over time unlike so many other childhood memories that are now long gone. Enjoy.< /text>

The African Adventure is the best. Every effort is made to create a roomier, more natural setting for the animals. The trainers really know their "stuff"! It's also heartening to see the community supportive by passing measure Z!</text>

Absolutely loved this zoo. Lots of animals , well maintained and friendly zoo keepers. Plan out coming early because they won't let you in after 4:30pm. Enjoy the food and watch Elephants and giraffes and many such animals.<//Review>

Zoo is very interactive, and if you have kids there are some nice play areas for them. This zoo never feels too crowded- it’s very spacious & well mapped out.  Staff is always friendly & helpful. Parking is easy. Entry fee is very affordable.  This zoo is truly a hidden gem in the Central Valley!!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I came on a field trip with my brother's school and there were only a few animals out. It might have been because we came in the afternoon and it was pretty hot. There were many different animals that I do not remember being here which was very neat. The highlight of my trip was being able to feed the giraffes.<//Review>

Chaffee Zoo is one of the greatest family spots in Fresno. Good for everyone or even for an afternoon date. Even on a weekend day, it isn't unreasonably packed.</text>

Being born and raised in Fresno I have been going to the Fresno Chaffee Zoo for years. It is so nice to see how it has evolved. There are so many wonderful attractions. Stingray Bay where you can actually pet a stingray. The seal exhibit that allows you to not only watch the seals and sea lions frolic and jump out of the water you can walk down to the underwater level and watch them swimming. The African Adventure was so well done. It is expansive with lots of room for the animals to roam.<//text>

<rating>5</rating><text>Sea lion cove is amazing. The newest Jurassic exhibit is super cool. Can't wait for the Asian exhibit, it's going to solve the problem of hardly being able to see the tigers. Oh, and feeding stingrays is something you gotta try, feels like a slimy, kinda prickly vacuum sliding over your hand very gently... It's weird for sure, but so fun to have them glide through the water, slurp up the food and keep on it's way.<//text>< Pictures>

Chaffee is a great zoo, however, I was very disappointed after getting there only to go d out that about half their zoo was empty due to creating new exhibits for the future.<//text>

<Review>My personal tour of the zoo was so informative because of the excellent information provided by the volunteer docent Linda Franklin. I have been to zoo's across America, but have never been so informed about the animals and the behind the scenes activities and care that must take place for the animals to remain healthy and active. A wonderful experience made all the better thanks to Linda. Be sure to spend a day, or two, when in Fresno, Ca.< /Review>< gmap_id>

Amazing zoo! Almost every habitat had a very knowledgeable intern available to answer any questions. The exhibits allow for great movement and guest visibility of the animals. The number of bathrooms and water fountains are amazing. You are never more than a short walk from either item. Most importantly is the cost. The admission cost is very low. You get a great, all day value at this zoo. The food, also, is very reasonable. Personal pizza for 8$? Yep, and it was very good. $2 bottle sodas. The mac and cheese was the highlight of lunch though. Amazing!<//Text>

Loved the birdshow, feeding the giraffes, petting the stingrays, and the zoorasice park was awesome. It was so cool to hear the dinosaurs and see them. The the kopje lodge had some awesome food! It was a little pricey but good. I got a turkey wrap and the kids got a personal size pizza. The wrap had some amazing flavor. The kids loved the pizza and actually ate it all. Over all a great experience and will be back.<//Review>< Rating>

<username>Wendy Vine< /username><text>I had 6 hours to fill before checking into my AirBnB so I decided to go to this zoo. I've had so much fun here, this is such a deal considering the price of admission! Feeding a giraffe was a great experience and I appreciate that they allow the giraffes to decide if they want to interact with people. Beers were kind of pricey but were worth it considering the views (which include a baby rhino). Heck of a deal, highly recommend.<//text><resp>None</resp><user_id>106286898073222083117<//user_id><pictures>None<//pictures>< Date>

The best zoo in California and one of the best in the world, wonderful displays, knowledgeable keepers, great family trip.  We have had a membership for 3 or 4 years and go every couple of months.  I always learn something new.  Parking is a bit of a pain on weekends< /review>

<Review>Very pleasantly surprised!! We live in southern California and are are members of the San Diego zoo and Safari park. They are both incredible but, the experience here at the Fresno zoo was one we will never forget! The up close animal encounters were so amazing... Feeding the giraffes, petting the stingrays, standing 2 feet away from the sloths while the keeper hand feed them... All amazing experience that we never get in San Diego and for just a fraction of the entrance price! The staff was incredible, the crowds were few, and we will return next time we are in Fresno!<//Review>< userid>

If you go before the kids get there, about 9 (fieldtrips), then you can have an enjoyable, peaceful morning. The animals are waking and some still sleeping/napping.<//review>

Giraffe feeding is a couple of dollars and petting stingrays is a bit more but you can get in for free with annual passes. You do pay for parking but it's only about $5. Get there right when it opens for a great spot. There are tons of great features and you definitely won't see everything in one day. Bring water and snacks for sure. Sunscreen up to. There are some places that aren't shady!</Text></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Being born and raised in Fresno I have been going to the Fresno Chaffee Zoo for years. It is so nice to see how it has evolved. There are so many wonderful attractions. Stingray Bay where you can actually pet a stingray. The seal exhibit that allows you to not only watch the seals and sea lions frolic and jump out of the water you can walk down to the underwater level and watch them swimming. The African Adventure was so well done. It is expansive with lots of room for the animals to roam.< /Text><username>Arman Loud</username>< userid>

They are continually improving, adjusting exhibits, adding animals and experiences, so that each visit has a good mix of familiar and new. It's great any time of the year. The food is a little overpriced, but you expect that. The animals are clearly week taken care of, and conservation is important to the entire operation.</Review>< gmapID>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>One of the best zoos I've been to.  Very crowded today as it was a school holiday but the parking lot full was a clue to how much people here love their zoo and for good reason.  Clean and well staffed.  The exhibits tend to the open and expansive almost as if one were not in a zoo at all.  The Africa display was particularly impressive.

It's worth an extra day even if your ultimate destination is Yosemite -- yes I think it's that good.< /text>< pictures>

Seems they are renovating or adding new stuff. One or two exhibits are closed, a few others are detoured a bit, but nothing unbearable. My son is the best tour guide I could ask for. I recommend buying the family pass as it pays for itself in just 2 or 3 visits. It's nice to be able to run over after school for an hour to kill time and not have to pay admission for such a short time frame.<//review>

I literally was so surprised at what a great zoo this is! The animals were all out, great exhibits, clean facilities, wonderful staff! We spent 4 hours there and enjoyed every minute. We only had ice cream but even that was delicious. Only downer is the people whose children don't behave... screaming, tapping glass, littering, climbing, etc. Please control your children... you're supposed to go see the animals at the zoo, not bring yours.</Review>

Lots of wheelchair or stroller access.  The Jurassic section was AWESOME!  We paid for the whole experience and fed manta rays - coolest thing ever, and fed giraffes as well, it was tons of fun.  If going in summer, take a hat and go early.</text>

Our family visited Chaffee Zoo in November 2016. Even though the review was high, I didn't have too much expectations, but we were all surprised how wonderful this zoo was. Habor seals were plafull in a beautifully desighed pool. They were so amusing to watch, we could have watched them 30 more minutes. In African grassland section,  2 rino were walking and eating peacefully.  We had relaxing lunch while looking over African grassland area. Try their local OJ sold at the cafe. It was very tasty. Overall, 4 of us had fantastic time here. We will happily visit again when we are in Fresno.</Text><gmap_id>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6< /gmap_id>< name>

I've been all over the country and this is one of the best zoos I've ever been to. The park is clean, the animals are happy and cared for, and there are always helpful employees and volunteers nearby. This place is a good way to use up two to three hours, even if your family is familiar with the zoo. Just be prepared for the lion exhibit if you're bringing small children; there is a retired range rover there, and they will fight you to the death to stay with that truck.< /Review>

Always clean
Big enough to walk with room around you.
Places to sit in the shade.
Feed the Giraffe.
Always building more space for the animals.

I've never been unhappy

New and improved exhibits and animals. Clean, affordable, mid-sized zoo with well-cared for animals. Lots of shade, and spots to rest. Variety of snacks and meals. I love Chaffer Zoo<//Text>

Very impressed by the change that they have made, how beautiful it has become and how wonderful the staff were! They had giraffe feedings and stingray feedings. We took great pix and spent at little over 2 hrs there without getting to see the reptile home.</review>

Love visiting here and my kids seeing all the animals.
Their shows could use some work, not entertaining at all and to much mention of saving planet earth. If your going to be convincing get some humor and skill back in the shows.<//Text>

We live in Bakersfield so we dont really live to close to any real big zoo's, so being able to go to Fresno and see the Chaffe Zoo was amazing. My little 14 month old loved seeing the seals from the underwater view room. She was a bit scared feeding the Giraffe but once mom and dad did it she was ok with it. It was such a beautiful day for our family. Thank you so much.< /text>

I try to come here Everytime I visit my family in Fresno. I absolutely love this zoo, the animals truely looked happy and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful to us last time we went. We only had about an hour so the woman at the ticket booth gave some suggestions on what to do with that hour to make the most of it.<//Review>

This is an amazing zoo. I, like many others, grew up when it was slightly shabby and perpetually struggling until the early 2000s; now, it is THE jewel of the Central Valley. With exhibits in both Spanish and English, a cheap entry fare, and an intimate setting coupled with the gorgeous Safari half, the Chaffee Zoo is absolutely the star of any casual tour of Fresno.

If you are a resident, purchase the yearly membership -- it more than pays for itself if you visit more than twice a year. The community and heart behind it is bigger than any nationally-recognized zoo.</text>

The Fresno Chaffee Zoo is a beautiful, well-maintained property with a wide range of animals and educational programs. The animal enclosures are designed to replicate their natural habitats and they look well and happy. (See the giraffes smile!) a visit to the zoo is highly recommended.<//text>

<text>My family and i LOVE the Fresno Chaffee Zoo! It's so cheap! We can enjoy ourselves for about $40 For a family of 4. The only things we dislike about the zoo is the location, the parking and paying to park. Other than those things, the zoo is fantastic. It transports you to another world away from the bustling city life. It's so peaceful and clean. We absolutely love it!<//text></record>

So far I like it more than any zoo I've been to. It is very big and has some beautiful scenery for the animals. The habitats are huge and the animals have room to roam. A wide variety of animals too. There are open areas that little monkeys can jump all around you and get inches from you. Walking through the aviaries is great as well. Definitely better than the LA zoo and Santa Barbara zoo. Animals seem more lively as well.<//review>

It might have been because we came in the afternoon and it was pretty hot. There were many different animals that I do not remember being here which was very neat.

Lots of wheelchair or stroller access.  The Jurassic section was AWESOME!  We paid for the whole experience and fed manta rays - coolest thing ever, and fed giraffes as well, it was tons of fun.  If going in summer, take a hat and go early.< /text>

I literally was so surprised at what a great zoo this is! The animals were all out, great exhibits, clean facilities, wonderful staff! We spent 4 hours there and enjoyed every minute. We only had ice cream but even that was delicious. Only downer is the people whose children don't behave... screaming, tapping glass, littering, climbing, etc. Please control your children... you're supposed to go see the animals at the zoo, not bring yours.< /text>

<review>Unique experience- well designed and executed. Food for humans has variety and great taste. Get there early on the weekend because it is a destination for families with young children and rightly so. The Fresno Chaffee Zoo has a rare gem on its hands, one we can all take pride in.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

A diamond in the rough of the big city. Improvements to animal habitats over the years is a plus. Zookeepers have great passion and respect for animals. Dino animatronics is a site to behold. Must see if you are a child of adventure age 1-100!</Text>

Visited this zoo this year with my kids. We Loved it! We went on a Saturday and it did get busy but we still had a good time. It does get less packed during the weekday. The paths are smooth for strollers, restrooms were clean, the park was clean. No graffiti or trash laying around. A lot of educational areas and the Safari area is really cool! There's a restaurant right by it so you can eat and see the animals. My kids loved it. Petting the stingrays is a must! It's really cool and feeding the giraffes too! Will be returning!</review>

The zoo is nice.  The bird show was funny.  The kangaroo area is great.  The African area has an open feel to it.  My kids loved feeding giraffes, Ray's, alpacas, and goats.  It is not huge, but very well designed.  My kids really liked the rope bridge in the tropical bird area.  It was a great visit.<//text>

We've been going to this Zoo for the.past 13 years and have made it a grandkids,and their parents family tradition.  My husband and I love it. The grandkids love it. Fresno chaffee zoo is so awesome.  I wish to thank the staff and the care takers for giving us the memories, that we've had for all these years.<//text>

Had a great visit. All of the staff were very friendly and informative. The elephants were replaced by rhinos. One died and the other is happy down in San Diego. She even has a boyfriend! A zoo guide showed us pictures on his phone. It was neat.</review>

I try to come here Everytime I visit my family in Fresno. I absolutely love this zoo, the animals truely looked happy and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful to us last time we went. We only had about an hour so the woman at the ticket booth gave some suggestions on what to do with that hour to make the most of it.<//text>

Such a reasonable price zoo with the perfect amount of attractions for kids. We were visiting family from Seattle and we're very impressed with the food offerings and the zoo.</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Having been a member of the Santa Barbara and Los Angeles Zoo’s  over the years when I moved to Fresno I was excited to discover  a zoo. It is a wonderful place. I have taken my grandsons several times. It is just the right size to be able to enjoy a few hours and not feel overwhelmed and exhausted by the experience. They recently added a water park/playground for young people and my grandsons really enjoyed it. The collection of animals is very impressive considering it is not especially large zoo. I heartily recommend this wonderful zoo as a place for families to have very pleasant day.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

This zoo is large. To see it properly is an all day process. In winter, the zoo closes at 4. If you take time out to eat lunch, you'll be able to cover the entire zoo in just enough time. There is a variety of animals and plenty to see! The staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Definitely a family friendly place to visit.</Text>

I have to say the Fresno zoo looks amazing.  Great place to bring the family. They have done so much renovations that it is a complete new Zoo if you haven't been here within the last 3 years.< /Review>

Clean, wide array of animals, my kids were so amazed to see the animals from their picture books in real life! They pet the rays and fed the giraffes. The keepers were knowledgeable and friendly. Some parts were under construction, excited to see what comes!</review>

Had a fabulous time!! Everything is so impressive compared to the last time I came 20+ years ago. I loved seeing the huge enclosure for the elephants and the rhinos. The huge restaurant, with great food, was an added plus! The grandkids loved the new kids area as well. We were a little disappointed that there were no zebras or any kind of bears. One of the zoo keepers was saying about the new tiger project, so we look forward to all the new projects that they are working on</review>

The zoo is an amazing place to visit. It is very well laid out with enough shade everywhere to keep you from being in the sun all the time. The exhibits are very well done. Zoo staff all very friendly and helpful. We loved our experience at the zoo. I would recommend anyone to visit the Fresno Chaffee Zoo, it's an amazing place< /Review>

<Text>Sometimes when we spent an afternoon at Roeding Park, we went to Fresno Chaffee Zoo. Not as often as I wanted, but still it was nice to get to see the animals. Loved to see the giraffes and elephants.  I could have just stopped at either of these and spend the rest of the day watching. A big thank you to the zoo employees for such a wonderful experience.<//Text>< Response>

Plenty of shade,  water fountains and clean restrooms.  Staff was friendly and helpful.< /Text></record>

Chaffee, while being surrounded by some of the worst Fresno has to offer is filled with the best it has to offer. A nice, clean, modern Zoo with plenty of attractions. Fun for the whole family, and lots of excellent events. Worth every penny and more.<//review>

Only thing I didn't like were the protesters outside using loud megaphones to protest the diary farms used for the ice cream. My son has sensory integration issues and so loud noises like the megaphone are difficult for him to sit through. Can't wait to come back again next year for more great ice cream and zoo experience. :)< /review><UserId.>100065533929266353625</UserId.>< Name>

It’s really fun and exciting see all these animals and then across it are these two play grounds which you have to pay for but is totally worth it if you are with your kids 9/10< /text>

I love that I can take my son now any time of day and enjoy a new section of the Zoo every time we go. During any weather. The food is great. The staff is very knowledgeable and polite. I have yet to try all the events, but my family favorites so far are Halloween at the park and Christmas lights decor in season. I can go on and on about how great this place is.<//Review>< userid>

The food is way to expensive. If I'm looking at it from a business point of view like they are I'd have food for people on a budget. Fresno only has one Zoo. They should be taking advantage of that and have options for the high class, mid class and low class. Instead they have this take it or leave it pricing< /Text>

I am so impressed with this zoo!  Kopje Lodge is so impressive as a dining area.   You feel as though you are visiting Africa or Jurassic Park. When you go to the Sea Lion exhibit. Be sure to go below. So you can see under the waters surface. Awesome!  This zoo visit will leave you feeling like you aren't anywhere near Fresno.  They have tried so hard to mimic the animals natural habitat.   I highly recommend a visit.   You won't be disappointed!! Thank you too all that care for the animals and maintain this beautiful zoo.<//Review>< Date>

<Text>The zoo is our favorite place!
We utilize many of the zoo's educational services including the behind the scenes encounters, tot time on week day mornings, and zoo camp over the summer.
We love the Ice cream Zoofari, Zoo Lights, and the Zoobilation.
Fresno is seriously lucky to have such an amazing place right in our backyard.
Be sure to eat there. The food is delicious and reasonably priced.< /Text><Resp>None</Resp>< userid>

<Review>Cages are designed with the animals comfort in mind. Tree lined walk ways in a lot of areas. Vending machines along paths in case you need a drink. Large seating area in covered food court. Feed the giraffes and sting rays. Lots if walking, but pleasant atmosphere.< /Review>< rate>

I have many fond memories of visiting the zoo with family and my school. I remember when you could ride the camels and take a picture, my mom still has the photo.

Now that I'm older and have my own children I visited this weekend and am so happy to see the constant improvements and new exhibits. The cafe is gorgeous. The water playground is a gem when you get tired of walking around in the heat with a cranky toddler. I especially love the little tables and chairs in corners of the zoo to sit down and eat snacks I brought with us. I nursed my baby there comfortably and then when we continued our tour I was delighted to see they actually have a breastfeeding nook in the kids area by the food shack.

Sea lion cove is another favorite and to be able to see them swimming underwater was an awesome experience. Thank you Chaffee zoo and staff. Your hard work and dedication is appreciated by many families.</Text>

Zoo boo was fun but it was kind of disorganized, and the lines for candy were really long, but the kids loved it! It was worth the money<//Text>

<review>Always a fun place to visit. The zoo is doing so much upgrades and it's starting to feel like a safari here. The elephant and rhino exhibit looked awesome! Really liked the dining area they setup next to the elephants. Makes it feel like you're in another country viewing these animals roam freely. I hope they take over the entire Roeding park and turn it into a drive thru safari. That would be awesome!!!<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>The staff have always been really friendly and knowledge every time I've been there. I really enjoy the “new” hours that have actually been in effect for at least a year or two now lol. It can usually get pretty crowded, but my tip is to go on Thanksgiving Day because it never gets too crowded then. They are only open until 2 pm on Thanksgiving, but it makes an awesome family tradition :) (my family's been doing this tradition for about 4 or 5 years now maybe?) Either way, if you love animals and/or smallish zoos you'll enjoy the Fresno Chaffee Zoo. I come from Cleveland OH and always thought that zoo was too big. IMO the Fresno Chaffee Zoo is the perfect size ♥️</Review></record>

They let way to many people inside sure everyone had a mask but it was crowded and the petting zoo was not open and you had to wait in line to get in and wait in line to feed the giraffe  wait in line to eat way over priced food . I left after 1 hour being there .<//Review>

They have done a fabulous job in the new safari section... There are a great number of well designed areas... love the area where you can walk among the kangaroos.  The new 'cats' are great.  I didn't eat here but the prices seem pretty reasonable to me... annual pass for families are a very good value!</Text>

<review>The zoo has changed a lot since I was little. With the new additions of the sea lions and the Safari zone, this zoo is now one of the best in the state. If you are in the Central Valley, you don't have to go to the Bay area or down south to have a great zoo experience. It's right there in your backyard. Make a day of it and see how much it's changed for the better!!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Fresno Zoo has changed for the better since I was a kid. The larger animals have larger space to roam. Zoo was clean and seemed to be kept up. I was there last for the zoofari with free ice cream stations throughout. Got to love all the specials the zoo does<//Review>< Pictures>

I really like the changes and upgrades that they have made to this zoo. The African exhibit is a lot of fun. They are still making more changes too. These changes were long overdue and I am glad to see that they are finally happening. I remember when I went in high school, I thought it was looking pretty sad back then. It's a completely different zoo now. My family and I are members and my kids love going there. Go and support your local zoo.< /Text>

This zoo is wonderful. The price is very reasonable ($12 per adult, children's prices vary by age but are less). The zoo is landscaped beautifully, they take good care of the animals (which means you may not see certain animals if it's too hot outside), and the food near the African exhibit if very good (but pricey). Costs $5 to park for the day (but gives you access to the surrounding park). Bring $3 to feed the Giraffes! Petting zoo and wonderful reptile house also available. Bathrooms clean and well stocked. Family bathrooms also available.</review>

The zoo is very nice. We love to see the open spaces for the elephants, lions and giraffes! The food though ... please!! Eat before or after... everytime we visit, the food is bad. Last time, the burgers were dry, the pizza was dry... This time--- Even the snacks were stale! The popcorn was stale, the dried fruit cups were stale... Why?? They have a nice looking cafeteria... just bad food!< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>My wife, kids, and I came to Fresno for a wedding from Florida and decide to go to the zoo with our infant and 4 yr old. We must say that this was a Great zoo! Especially for the price! You get the chance to get up close and personal with so many animals like elephants, rhinos, gazelle, sloths, monkeys, a bunch of different species of birds, stingrays and sharks. There was also a great petting zoo area that you are able to interact and pet goats, baby cows, donkeys, turkeys, and lamas which my son and I enjoyed a lot! Plus We were amazed that our 4 yr old son was able to feed a giraffe in the new African animals exhibit (which is massive) for only $2. He was Sooo excited by the experience that he fed them 10 more times! The food and drink prices were very reasonable as well.  Plus they are military and senior citizen friendly and offer a discounted rate for both.  It was a great way for the whole family to hang out and not spend a lot of money. If we ever come back to the Fresno area we are definitely coming back to this zoo. We highly recommend it anyone!!!<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>They have changed so much,  I use to get sad that the elephants and others were in such small places like a jail for animals. They have improved so much I saw family of rhinos in the newly improved area with many other animals. I cannot express how happy I am that these animals are getting more space and it's beautiful how they are making it look. I will definitely come back to see how it is finished.</Text>< pictures>

Great place to spend the day with kids! Best thing about the zoo is their membership prices for families which include unlimited # of children...so that means a family with 6 kids pays the same as a family with 3 kids. Coming from a household with 6 kids, I know that large families will appreciate this!</Text>

This is the most amazing zoo! Their open spaces with elephants and rhinos is only exceeded by the huge animal preserve near San Deigo. This is a very fun place. The guides are very nice and helpful. Children can feed the giraffes too. There are other new exhibits on the way, with plenty of open space. Fun open or closed dining areas are avail and the food and beverages are above expectation. Just come and have fun, but check the hrs first.<//Text>

You don't leave feeling an Injustice for the animals Also tour guides are throughout the park for questions and answers about the animals The environment is clean and signs are posted throughout pointing to exibits
Restrooms, changing and nursing stations, and food. A wonderful place to be on any day of the week.<//Review>

Had a fabulous time!! Everything is so impressive compared to the last time I came 20+ years ago. I loved seeing the huge enclosure for the elephants and the rhinos. The huge restaurant, with great food, was an added plus! The grandkids loved the new kids area as well. We were a little disappointed that there were no zebras or any kind of bears. One of the zoo keepers was saying about the new tiger project, so we look forward to all the new projects that they are working on< /review>

The food is way to expensive. If I'm looking at it from a business point of view like they are I'd have food for people on a budget. Fresno only has one Zoo. They should be taking advantage of that and have options for the high class, mid class and low class. Instead they have this take it or leave it pricing< /Review>

The staff have always been really friendly and knowledge every time I've been there. I really enjoy the “new” hours that have actually been in effect for at least a year or two now lol. It can usually get pretty crowded, but my tip is to go on Thanksgiving Day because it never gets too crowded then. They are only open until 2 pm on Thanksgiving, but it makes an awesome family tradition :) (my family's been doing this tradition for about 4 or 5 years now maybe?) Either way, if you love animals and/or smallish zoos you'll enjoy the Fresno Chaffee Zoo. I come from Cleveland OH and always thought that zoo was too big. IMO the Fresno Chaffee Zoo is the perfect size ♥️</Text>

<review>Being a Member, I don't ever have wait long. Show my pass, scan in, and adventure begins with my little crew.

We always eat at the Safari area. As a member, I get a discounts so I enjoy it. I don't wait too long for my food and portion is good size. Kids love the Mac N Cheese and I definitely love the portion of that. My most recent visit was about a month ago. I ordered extra fries like usual and this time I felt I got very little for the price I was paying.  Normally the fries would be enough for 3 kids, however on that day, it only was enough for 2 kids out of the 5. I didn't say anything at the time since I gave my meal to the kids because they were hungry.

For that particular day, I give the trip to the Zoo a 3 star rather than a 4 star.</review>< Date>

<Response>None</Response><text>It would be nice if the parking was included in the membership, or at least discounted.  We tried to make it worth it and we stayed to see the ducks at the pond after the zoo closed up.  I guess they have a playground there in that large park , but we left before we had a chance to play there because the kids forgot to bring their jackets.

We have the annual membership and it's kind of annoying when we all have to identify ourselves each time we go.  But the kids enjoy going.< /text><gmapID>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6< /gmapID>< user_id>

Nice simple doggy park for your fur baby to just get out and run wild...
They have a water fountain for your doggy but make sure to bring poop bags for them.
Plus you can walk your doggy on a leash throughout Roeding park as well.</Text>

<review>I drive the two hours from Stockton to come to this zoo instead of any of the several that are closer to us because it's amazing!

They have the Stingray bay where unlike other places, you can actually feed them! It's 1 dollar for a cup of little fish and they come right up to you and eat from your hand!
You can also feed the giraffes which seems to what the younger kids really enjoy.
I haven't been through it but they have the Kanga walk as well.

My personal fave is the big cats which there is no shortage of. They have tons of room to run around and do lion, and tiger stuff!

Overall it's a really cool place and worth the visit for sure.<//review><time>1547250374760<//time>< gmapID>

<Review>I highly recommend a season pass if you have Kids. I also recommend getting a parking pass if you plan on going frequently. My kids love feeding the giraffes. The expansion is fantastic and seems like it gets better every time we go.<//Review>< Rate>

Fun for the whole family...We fed a giraffe. We love the sea lions and seals, cheetahs, and learned a lot from the keeper talks! We have found that going in the winter is excellent because you get to ask a lot more questions during the keeper talks! When you get cold, go to the reptile house or the sloth habitat, which are both heated.<//Review>

My first visit to the zoo was wonderful! Couldn't brag enough to everyone about it. I was very disappointed on my visit this year seems like all the animals were missing no tortoise no bears only one elephant one ant eater seemed halp of what it was. Entry went from 10 bucks to 12.95 and only halp the animals.< /text>

Great new African savannah area with lions, elephants, giraffes and much more! Walk-through kangaroo/wallaby area fun! New water area will offer great relief in the summer heat. Dino-dig always fun if you don't mind a little dirt! We had a great day and hope to return again.</review>

The chaffee zoo is both part of the conservation and repopulation programs, so you will often see babies at this zoo. They staff is amazing and willing to answer any question your overly exuberant child might ask. The zoo is also working hard to continually improve the animal habits, making them appear and feel more like natural habitats.
The African safari habitat is amazing and one of my favorite parts of the zoo.

Be prepared for the $5 parking fee. Buy your tickets online so you can skip the line at the gate. It will cost you $3 to feed the giraffes, and $2 to visit the stingrays and a dollar more feed them. The current dinosaur exhibition has an additional entrance fee.<//Review><time>1562539987469< /time></record></dataset><record>

We just spent a great day at the Fresno Chafee Zoo. It was a beautiful day and the animals were out enjoying the weather. The African exhibit is great and it was very easy to see all the animals. We also participated in behind the scene animal encounters and sting ray cove, I would highly recommend!! We will definitely be back.</Text>

Fresno Zoo has changed for the better since I was a kid. The larger animals have larger space to roam. Zoo was clean and seemed to be kept up. I was there last for the zoofari with free ice cream stations throughout. Got to love all the specials the zoo does< /Text>

I love this Zoo.. my son would come every week if he could. Staff are often frazzled and bossy.(snapped at my five year old old for roaring) but overall great. Side not in case staff read. Don't discourage a kid from learning animals and sounds the animals make. Don't just "don't do that, he does not like it" a child. Explain what the sound mimicking does to the animal. That's children 101 if your tired of being understanding and patient FIND ANOTHER JOB.< /review>

The zoo has really been upgraded since the past few years. There are still new construction along the way. It's a nice place for my family and I to come enjoy the animals. Bring extra cash to feed the giraffes for $3 or pet the sting rays! You can spend hours here. Love it.< /review>

<Text>Best zoo I have been too. Great experience from feeding giraffes to being up close with rare animals.for only 10$ extrance fee.3$ to feed giraffes and 2$ to touch sting rays. Great place.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuLfAtKozpwBGjd4pbJuTz5tUknXhAbMK3HQmQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

I loved the fact that i went in at 12 and there was not many people as i expected. The only down side is that the cashier for the food was very rude. Her adittude was not okay, i didnt want to complain which i should have. But didnt because she was not going to ruin my day with my child. I had an amazing time and so did my son. He wants to go back and we will soon. His favorite was the lion we scattered the whole thing twice trying to look for it and we did find it. Was very fun.</review>

Great place to walk aerpijd and enjoy the different exhibits.   The price is reasonable and the sights are many.  Highly recommend good walking shoes.   Great number of chairs and benches to take a seat. Lots if things to do for the little ones.  Recommend clearing your calendar for the day and getting an early start to avoid the parking issues. Easy to find off the freeway and the staff are phenomenal.   Truly professional knowledgeable and courteous.   Thank you Fresno Zoo!< /review>

Freaking gorgeous! As a Sacramento native I was expecting a sad zoo like Sacramentos, but they did a fantastic job with the renovations and all of the interactive enclosures are so fun. We were face to face with tiny money's, kangaroos, birds and more.. San Diego Zoo is gorgeous and takes first place, but I think this is my second favorite Zoo in California.< /Review>

Love the improvements at the zoo for the animal habitats. The dirt paths are a little hard on wheelchairs or crutches, but it was a wonderful experience with the kids. They love that the peacock was Loose by the snack bar and they could get an up-close View</Text>

The zoo is always a great place to spend the day with family, especially little ones who have never been. The only down side, however, is that there is never enough shade in some areas. The "food court" area near the entrance to the Safari zone is the worst. There are tons of open tables that nobody wants because they have been roasting in the Valley heat all day. Other than that, it is always fun and enjoyable.< /text>

<Text>Absolutely loved this place,  i felt like I was in the countries where some of the animals actually come from,  the landscape of the whole zoo is beautiful,  the way each animals homes are set up , while we sat at th Kopje Lodge eating lunch we were able to look out at the elephant,  white rhinos & deers, it felt like I was on a safari adventure!  I definitely want to go back and take our grandchildren next. Definitely a place to visit while in Fresno</Text></record></dataset><record>

Chaffee Zoo is an intimate experience with wonderful animal habitats. I have been to many zoos and this is one of my favorites. We usually even spend the money to get the yearly family pass. Well worthen the money and I highly recommend it.</Text>

This is a pretty good zoo, lots of stuff to see and the animals seem to be well taken care of.  The habitats look natural for the most part, and we enjoy the interactive nature of this zoo, like the tiger feeding and giraffe feeding.  From the lizards to the elephants our kids where enthralled.  We been here twice since moving to the Valley.  We'll mostly likely be back soon.<//text>

<review>I hadn't been to the zoo in almost 15 years, and it's like a different place now. They've done an amazing job with the new attractions and sprucing up the older ones. It feels like a real, big-city zoo. Thankful we got the season pass.<//review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Love coming to the Fresno Zoo.  My kids love to feed the Giraffes. It's a very cute zoo. There's a nice park with a pond of ducks and geese in the parking area.< /Review>

I love this park. This park holds many great memories to me; from swinging on the swings as a child to feeding the ducks and geese with my fiance.

My favorite section of the park is of course the geese and ducks. They are so cheerful and happy to see people all the time. They just want to be fed and full so they can sleep comfortable in there giant pond.

Being there is just relaxing overall. The green grass makes it peaceful, the trees make the place shady, and the overall setting is just great for families and close ones alike.

You can take meat over to the park and sit on the benches, barbequing all day. Take the family out for an escape away from home or just chill out on the grass with whoever you want. You're only limited to your imagination.

There's also bathrooms there, so it's an all day type of place, and there is also a zoo inside Roeding park.

The zoo holds many animals like lions, elephants, alligators, snakes, tortoise, and much more. It's just a place you have to go to enjoy and see it for yourself.<//Text>

I would give 0 stars if I could.   Waiting for a meal was fine, but standing in line I waited patiently for 8-10 minutes.  When I get up to pay another lady steps in and asks if her soda coupons would work today.  The cashier says” let me take care of this person, I’ll be back in a few minutes,  please get in another line”.   So I moved over to start the 10 minute wait again.  By then the  food was getting cold.  After 10 minutes waiting the first cashier came back and other people jumped in line to pay for their food.   I give up!!  I’m going home and NEVER coming back!!!!</Text>

<review>Chaffee Zoo has done an excellent job in the past 5-8 years of revamping the exhibits and family friendly activities and spots for kids. May 5th a large play area with water activities is opening up and it looks awesome. Price is affordable and parking is not usually too bad. I will continue to support Zoo measures as it looks as if the money is being spent productively.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Great family friendly place. Really like the upgrades. Some of the areas were dirty and construction filled when I went. But gotta understand it's only temporary and it's to build everyone something better. Only thing I wish they had were little baby kangaroos you might be able to pet in petting zoo. Like the fair used to have at 1 point before kids started getting sick. Possibly controversial but not like they don't have a petting zoo already, PEOPLE/KIDS just gotta wash hands before putting in their mouth....A NO BRAINER</review>

This is an awesome zoo!  I admit I haven't been to many others, but I love our zoo!  The recent African Safari expansion is awesome and they are still working on getting more animals and filling in other areas!  The restaurant is right next to an area where the rhino's and emus might come by and pay you a visit.  Awesome experience!<//text>

If you haven't been here for a while you are in for a treat! They have updated and remodeled so much in the last couple years. The newest and most impressive additions have included Sea Lion cove, an otter habitat, the new African Safari with lions, cheetahs, and rhinos.< /text>

<review>Had a wonderful time here. Staff is very knowledgeable. Facility is clean and open. Went with a few classmates, they have a lot of endangered species. Some animals are there for rehabilitation or because they have permanent disabilities (such as the blind sea lion). There is plent of space for the animals to roam, they are treated well and seem very content.</review>< UserId.>

<text>The Chaffey Zoo was a lovely after noon visit. Parking, admission and food was reasonably priced. While it is not the San Diego Zoo, the exhibits were attractive. One thing that was cool was their attention to providing shade for visitors. We enjoyed being able to see the animals fairly closely. We were able to actually see all the big cats. I especially enjoyed the bird show, which closed with being able to pose for pictures with a large eagle owl or a beautiful golden eagle.</text>< Pics>

The zoo today is so special in it's magical way of bringing the wild animals of the world to life as kids see them alive and in a habitat designed to keep them comfortable with good vision of them . 60 years I've been going and it still has that special ability to renew imagination and appreciation of nature's best .< /text>

Awesome zoo! It's a great place to take the kids & even if you just want to take a date. Not a very big zoo but still a good size to have a good time.<//text>

The zoo is a very nice zoo. There is a great range of animals, its laid out well, and the kids seemed to love it. We greatly enjoyed it!

Our only issue during the day was the customer service, or rather lack of, from the cafe to the shop, the stingray people to the front gate. Every person we spoke to was either rude, condescending, bored or a combination thereof. It left a sour note, especially when my 8 year old nephew asked for help in the shop with a product and was ignored by 2 staff members. I would think a place that deals with people on the regular would be more personable.</review>

<review>The dog park is nice here and if you already have a parking pass you don’t have to keep paying $5 every time to park. Annual Park Passes can be purchased for $50 from the SP+ office in downtown Fresno and they are good for Roeding and Woodward park. You can use them for any of your vehicles too which is nice.

It's kind of like a maze. I somehow missed out on quite a few attractions, but all-in-all it was beautiful. There are a lot of birds. The sea lions seem happy. The orangutans seemed bored. The reptile exhibit had a large variety and I really enjoyed the sting ray and shark exhibit. Feed the sting rays and sharks. They suck the fish and shrimp out of your hands. Don't be scared. I was scared and I'm glad I fed them. The sharks feel like rocks when you touch them.</text>

Great sights and good food. They have all the normal fair food stuff, plus a restaurant where you can get burgers, pizza, sandwiches, etc. and sit outside in a large patio area right next to the big outdoor exhibit.<//text>

< review>
Roeding Park Dog Park is divided into two sections, one for small dogs (less than thirty pounds) and one for larger dogs. There was water available for your dog and "poop bags". Apparently people used the bags because there was not an accumulation of dog feces, the grass area was kept clean. Only two other visitors while we were there. We spent approx. 2 hours. The small dog area had 1 picnic table in a shaded area for the people to sit and one cement bench in the sun. Big dog area had a picnic table in the sun, and no shade anywhere. Guess the weather would be the deciding factor, too hot to sit in the sun. Otherwise quiet, friendly and a nice experience.<//review>

Had a good few hours today at the Zoo.
Had lunch at the Kopje lodge, and enjoyed the view out to the Savannah.
The Zoo grounds were very clean inside, outside the facility in and around the parking lot a different story...We will return..</review>

Amazing before, now more than ever with the African Safari extension. We learned that zoo's around the world actually use Fresno Chaffee Zoo as an example of how it should be done!!!!!...6 stars< /Text>

<text>Went to Zoolights to relax. Instead got to hear the cheetahs kill a stray cat. Herman who works there chose to get in my face after I went to the front to complain about his attitude. Been a member 5 years,  but thanks to feeling VERY threatened by him I don't think I'm going back< /text></record>

This is actually a very nice zoo. My family and I prefer Chaffee Zoo to the Los angles zoo. The zoo is kept very clean compared to other zoos we have visited in major metro areas in the state.  Keep up the good work.< /Review>

We came here for my son's 2nd grade field trip. It was our first time and we loved it. I was thinking the zoo would be bigger but was delighted to see that it wasn't too big. The attractions are clean with clear views. The animals look well cared for. Great price.<//Review>

<name>Shey Harlacher<//name><Review>Take the kiddos here once a week and always come with put of town guests. This is a FABULOUS zoo. All of the animals are rescues, woukd not survive in the wild or are part of a species rehabilitation program. Fantastic exhibits and reasonably priced, delicious food. So many learning experiences and activities for kids. They have sandboxes, fossil digs, sting ray touch exhibit. My daughter loves the safari jeep at the lion exhibit. Admission is very reasonable compared to other zoos. Its very clean and the staff is knowledgeable. Plus you can also buy a parking pass for the Fresno regional parks at their box office to save you a trip downtown.</Review>< gmapID>

<Review>I've been going to the Chaffee Zoo since i was in kindergarten. I love the Chaffee Zoo.
As an adult i purchased the membership for me and 2 adults with 2 children for $110. That's 365 days I'm allowed to go for FREE.
Within a week i made back what i spent here comes with a 10% discount as well.  This zoo has become apart of my life.  With the awesome water feature my daughter and i will coming here over the summer.  They have alot of events planned through out the year.
Please visit there website for more information</Review>< Pictures>

Fresno Chaffee Zoo punches way above it's weight class. Definitely one of the nicest mid sized zoos I've been to. It's no destination zoo like Atlanta or San Diego, but it is worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood. Highly recommend.<//Text>

<Text>My family absolutely loves this zoo! We have been members for two years. They have something for every age group. You can pet the sharks and sting rays at Sting Ray Bay. Feed the giraffes in the new Safari area,  which is really AWESOME!! Cool down, and play in the water by the bone dig area. Watch a really neat bird show. Or sit for literally hours while your kids run from one side of the glass wall to the other, watching the sea lions play! They have multiple options for food. They have the traditional snack bar area that serves hot dogs, nachos,  corndogs , and drinks.  Or what we like to do is go to the Safari area.  They have this HUGE sitting area outside under a covered patio over looking the animals.  The have multiple little restaurants to choose from. (kind of cafeteria style) They have Italian food, deli style up scale sandwiches,  beef and chicken  burgers, chicken strips, sliders and more. Everything is made fresh while you wait right in front of you. If you are a member you will get discounts on everything 😉 I also recommend buying a few( depending upon how large your family is) of the novelty cups. The refills on them are only about a dollar and change. You can bring them w/ you each time you return to the zoo. It saves a lot of money. Also the food portions are quite large.  You could definitely get away with sharing your meals. Restrooms are always clean. Parking is only 5 bucks. I recommend coming early. I believe it opens at 8am. It's such a wonderful place to visit.  They animals are clearly will taken care of.  This zoo has inspired my daughter to be come a zoologist. The love for the animals really comes through when you speak to any of the zoo crew.</Text><gmapID>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6<//gmapID><Date>1534456017693<//Date>< username>

<review>I have been going to the zoo as a child and taken my own children for over 50 years.  The zoo has changed SO much recently.  The African safari like exhibit has a large eating area where you can watch the Rhinos while you munch on a pizza or hamburger with your kids ( or now grandkids)  We just celebrated our granddaughters 7th birthday there an became annual pass holders.
Get to the zoo with your kids !</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

You have to backtrack a few times just to see all the animals. Other than that, everything was great! Good family funday! Just remember to take cash because most of the attractions inside the zoo, are cash only.<//review>< Gmap_id>

The zoo was so much more than I had expected.  The baby giraffe and the the elephants were my favorites.  The grounds were lovely, and the people were friendly and helpful.  Sea Lion Cove was very interesting, and I loved that it was landscaped with California native plants.  It was both lush and drought tolerant.<//Text>

I've always loved this park since I was a child. There are just so many memories that you have the opportunity to make here. When you feel the need to unplug your family from technology, this is a great place to go.< /Review>

Easily the best zoo in the central valley. Exhibits are nice, animals are active and healthy, not as busy as Sam Francisco. Cheap too, two adults and a 3 year old was $30. Great zoo.</text>

<Review>The zoo was awesome before they started making changes cuz they expected Fresno residents to pay for them, then when minimum wage went up guess what so did the price of entrance so Fresno residents  are paying for that... is that right? that Fresno has money in the budget but won't use it to pay the employees there sad ..almost 40 for two people and 1 child,closer to 80 to snack too  and ride the train so we don't take our baby like before we used to go every weekend  now just when he crys to go. Wish we can go back to the good old days.</Review><resp>None< /resp>< Pics>

<userid>104428678051296534798<//userid><review>Totally worth going. Truck broke down in Fresno and wanted to have an afternoon that wasn't stressful. Animals were out and moving so that also added to the fun, missed giraffe feeding but stingray and shark meet and greet made up for that.

Staff was fun, Friendly and approachable. Even though I made it for (essentially) the end of the day they still wanted to engage and have more than just a surface level conversation. Met a twin who's twin also works there, I'm a twin so it felt kinda cool to have that and other neat little moments with the staff (thanks Amanda you were bubbly and it rubbed off made the afternoon more enjoyable)

Prices were quite reasonable and overall a good way to spend an afternoon.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Affordability, quality of habitats, and exceptional upkeep of the animals, makes this park a must see destination! I was thoroughly impressed by the design of the African Safari portion of the park and there are plenty of shade trees to keep you cool. They also have a petting zoo!!! Low price and big family fun!<//Review>

Such a great zoo. I went when I was younger and just took my kids for the first time. The expansion is great and the new restaurant was amazing. Such a cool spot to eat and watch the animals.< /Text>

<Review>One of the best Zoo's in California,  don't miss this one. Compared to the San Diego Zoo the city has a tax measure that helps expand an improve this Zoo. The new African exhibit is awesome. The also have a winged wonders bird show you won't want to miss. Parking can be difficult so get there early.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

This place was amazing! My boyfriend and I drove two hours just to see the zoo. It was well worth every penny! We got to touch stingrays and feed giraffes.  All of the exhibits where great! The sea lion cove was up close and personal.  All of the staff were friendly and the animals were too. Overall the place was wonderful.< /Review>

<review>Love visiting our beautiful zoo..they have done a great job with new exhibit the sea lion cove is incredible. I simply can't wait for new African safari exhibit those elephants need more space. Also one of my favorite things to do is visit buttercup the jersey cow in the petting zoo been visiting her since she was a calf my how she has grown. Highest recommendation to go visit.</review>< Pictures>

The dog park is divided into two sections to separate small and large dogs. There's a small dog play group that meets every Saturday called Tiny Paws Fresno! Very friendly dogs and people!</Text>

This Zoo is amazing! And it just keeps on getting better! After Prop Z past they started renovating everything. There will soon be an "African Safari" type area as well, when they take over about 20 acres of land from the surrounding park. It should be an incredible sight to see when it opens!</text>

Fresno Chaffee zoo is the best family place in the Valley. There is so much to do from feeding the giraffe to touching the sting rays. The best place tho was enjoying lunch overlooking the African Savannah. Higjlu recommend it.<//review>

<Text>The African Adventure is a great example how enclosures should be nowadays-more space. The Kopé Lodge has decent food and provides a nice sitting view to rest and watch the safari. The only concern is the placement of the Asian elephants, tigers, and sloth bears.  They are often overlooked and kept in small enclosures. Every time I pass them they are depressed and sleep most of the time.</Text>< response>

This is the only zoo that I know of in the area, so it's a relief that it is so good. The exhibits are well made, and the animals are well taken care of.< /text>

Love the new exhibits added, kids of all ages get entertained easy. Favorite part was the safari and seeing all types of animals together and roaming freely.< /Review>

If your a member you should at least get a better discount then what they give for food or anything else paying $100 for a membership it would be cool to get a little more of a discount on things</review>

What a fun day! Great deal on the price of admission, lots of great animals to see. The African safari exhibit is quite splendid. Members of staff are friendly and passionate and know all the animals names and back-story's. Can't wait for my next visit! Snack and food options while inside are limited and expensive.<//Review>

A good cheap place to go hang out for the day. It's been a long time since I've been but just as fun as I remember it. Plus they added on a whole new section and did a really good with it.</Review>

<text>Very good selection of animals in naturalistic habitats that allow good views of the animals.  Great people to help
Reasonably priced snacks.  Small enough to see it all with older kids.  Large enough to a variety.< /text>< Pictures>

Great zoo! The only downside is the parking to get into the park that houses the zoo, story/play land and the park. Remember to bring it in cash too, 5$. The African exhibit is amazing, the reptile house is fun and don't forget the sea lion and seal exhibit either.</text>

My parents took us to this zoo many years ago, I was there with my Grandkids. I had as much fun seeing their little faces light up at all the wonderful exhibits. The upgrades are amazing. Much more kid friendly.< /Review>

We love that we can do the whole zoo in one day, although we usually don't. They are always adding new exhibits and updating/upgrading. The people giving the zoo talks are always so patient with my dons many questions.</Text>

Food and drinks are expensive here if you plan to eat here. Went around the whole zoo but they were missing a few animals. Some you couldn't see because they were sleeping in the shade away from sight but that's okay. Nice place to walk around on a date or bring the kids. I wish I could have seen the elephant and the rhino's a little closer but them having space to roam around is better for them. It gets hot so make sure to stay hydrated.</review><user_id>111813218557259356435<//user_id>< Name>

The enterance and the first exibits I visited were beautiful, leading to the only problem I seen, the Giraffe feeding. We are allowed to feed the giraffes, but not allowed to touch them. This doesn't seem like a too big of a problem, until you have many children in the feeding area being yelled at from staff not to touch them Every time they hold their hand out. If giraffes are so dangerous that they can break your hand in one hit with their head, why couldn't they have us pay to feed another less dangerous animal. Staff should not have to yell at children to not touch the giraffes from across the exibit. The feeding area should be closed and the giraffes should only be looked at from a view like all the other animals.<//review>

< review>
Small Zoo,  all the animals the kids' wanted to see were not out, ultimately the kids were bored. Took about 45 mins to walk around the entire Zoo. We were visiting from Texas and this compared to our Houston Zoo this was night and day difference. Not worth it. (Visited back in 2011)</review>

<review>When I traveled to Fresno and was lucky enough to have a little time the afternoon before I left, I thought visiting the zoo would be a nice way to kill some time. I completely underestimated this zoo. It was fantastic! The African exhibit was incredible and I could have spent the entire day watching the animals interact on the Savannah. The monkey cage was also ablot of fun. They had stingrays that you could pay to interact with that looked fun, but I didn't a chance to participate. My only complaint was the sea lion habitat. The habitat itself was beautiful, but it was so big I just stared at empty water the whole time. Overall it was amazing and I will definitely go back!<//review>< resp>

One of the best zoological gardens anywhere! But currently remodeling and moving many of the exhibits leaving lots of empty areas. Very popular in Fresno. The African Adventure is amazing and also the Sea Lion Cove. We purchase annual membership so our children and grandchildren always have a zoo visit to look forward to when they come to see us in Fresno. Feed a giraffe! Pet the stingrays! Chillax in the Amazonian Rainforest!<//review>

Went to see the African Adventure area. It was done very well. The animals were all out to see. Some sunning and napping. Ate lunch at the African Adventure eatery. Food was good and price reasonable. They also have specialty coffees and baked goods. All in all a good day. Get there early on  weekdays as there are MANY school children visiting.</Review>

It's a small Zoo, but it's wonderful. There are sand pits for the kids to dig (fun for kids, not for mommy and germophobes). Bring water clothes for the kids for the water play area.< /text>

It's a cool place, small playground, the thing I didn't like is even outside the "dog park" fenced in area, where they can run free, I still kept finding poop everywhere. (Dog of course) I couldn't even play soccer with my son in the field because it was everywhere<//Text>

Very nice zoo, parking will get pretty crazy on weekends and you have to pay to park before you even step foot to pay to enter the zoo. But they have numerous animals that you would find at any other zoo. The staff here are great, and very knowledge about each animal they have. The cafe is in the heart of the zoo and it was also really good. Maybe we were just starving lol.. They have nachos, hotdogs, churros, grilled sandwiches, chicken salads, burgers.. Also a good selection of desserts like cookies, brownies, pie, etc..<//text>

Came from out of town on the way to Yosemite. Thankfully arrived before the pay booth was opened but definitely would NOT have paid $5 for what they have. No dogs there and no dog pick up bags. They did have a water fountain.</Review>

It's surprisingly amazing, especially with the new African exhibit. Every time I go I'm always impressed since it seems like Fresno shouldn't have something this nice. The price is very low too, especially compared to big name zoos like in San Diego. Definitely opt for feeding the giraffes since it's only like 2 bucks but is a lot of fun and makes a great picture. Parking sucks though. Last time I went was on Labor Day weekend and we were gridlocked in the overflow lot for a good 10 or 15 minutes. I'm surprised we even found a spot. The walk from the parking lot to the zoo can be pretty long too.<//Text>< Pictures>

Growing up with Chaffee Zoo and Roeding Park filled my mind with many exciting memories as a child that has helped shaped my character, personality, and well being, with adventure treks and escapades of a little ones imagination to the profound respect for animals, being an animal lover myself.
I witnessed all the amazing upgrades and transformation of Chaffee Zoo and all for the better of the animals and entertainment.
Yes there were dark days of yesterday's past with the famous Nosey the elephant who spent many of her years in a tight closed-in metal bar space. As a child it was so exciting at that time to be able to feed her peanuts. I will not forget the touch of her trunk, she loved people. I profoundly remember a donation bin to upgrade Noseys environment, one which you drop your coin as it spirals down in a circling cyclone. Thank God Fresno residents came through along with many others in thier contributions, I believe it was in 1982 Nosey had a new upgraded and amazing home now of natural dirt, a swimming pool, waterfall, and toys to play with. She also for the first time in over 30 years had other elephant companions. I'm glad she had this experience before her passing. I believe to this day it was Nosey who inspired many to fight for the animals here to have much more. Yes there's the bitter/sweet of animals being in captivity but today most of these animals were born more or less in captivity and wouldn't survive the wild. So enjoy the many adventures to come. Thank you all who had part in giving Nosey her new home and for the amazing upgrades of the Fresno Chaffee Zoo.
As an adult I walk into the zoo with my annual membership and my children at my side seeing the excitement of sparkle in eye. It these moments that I re-live the child in me. Let the journey begin!<//Text>< user>

<Date>1447872857913< /Date><rating>5</rating><Review>When I traveled to Fresno and was lucky enough to have a little time the afternoon before I left, I thought visiting the zoo would be a nice way to kill some time. I completely underestimated this zoo. It was fantastic! The African exhibit was incredible and I could have spent the entire day watching the animals interact on the Savannah. The monkey cage was also ablot of fun. They had stingrays that you could pay to interact with that looked fun, but I didn't a chance to participate. My only complaint was the sea lion habitat. The habitat itself was beautiful, but it was so big I just stared at empty water the whole time. Overall it was amazing and I will definitely go back!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Text>I love this Zoo! Overpriced- just as any other Zoo but there are so many exhibits and also a new "Savannah" exhibit where you can feed Giraffes from a canopy. In one of the bird buildings, a bird landed on my husbands shoulder and stayed there for around 20 minutes- the employee said it wasn't rare! We loved it here.</Text>< pics>

Very nice zoo and activity to do in Fresno. The Safari exhibit is a highlight, with multiple species sharing a wide open space. You can even feed the garaffes.<//Text>

I visit to Fresno Chaffee Zoo today and I was very disappointed because elephant the kind of skinny and the sea lions those are bigger and very happy and Indian and dining area where you can buy food at where the green chairs are at they should have some kind of side that window or some new pictures up there so it more attractions in the zoo to track more people and kids in there because it's boring</review>

I love the zoo. I only have 2 complaints, that "zooracic park" thing was stupid.  The other thing is that I never see the keepers out.  Used to be you would see them around even if it was keeper talk time.  I miss that< /review>

<text>Excellent for families with younger children. I recommend getting the Family membership! Plenty of Zoo Events, but are always really crowded.

Edit- we've moved out of CA, and our new local zoo cannot compare to the Fresno Chaffee Zoo! Fresno's zoo has TONS of activities that many other zoos don't (Dino Dig, Stingray Bay, the bird show, giraffe feedings, Small Wonders petting zoo..) in addition to the best exhibits I've seen in nationwide (African Adventure, Sea Lion Cove ..)<//text><user>116421395025349103554< /user><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Rating>5</Rating>< Time>

<user_name>Mr F</user_name><review>As zoos go I'll as far as to say it's a C+. To start, at it's busiest parking is impossible. The lot arrangement is poor due to it's single entry/exit point, lack of room, and the fact that it is shared by the amusement park across the street. Parking was $5 but I could see it being free when it's not so busy.

The membership to the zoo for a whole family is $99, if you can't decide if you want to buy it in line you can actually pay your normal entry fees and then comeback and have that day's fees go toward the  membership if you do decide to get one. There are, of course, different levels to membership but the gist is you can stroll in on the member line and get 10% off purchases in the zoo.

The zoo itself does have some great exhibits, most of what you'd expect to find at a zoo but some are just a bit lacking. I've only been here a few times so there may be other ways around but from what I can tell there are at least two, maybe more, exhibits that so not have handicap/stroller ramps on one or both sides.

The dining facilities range from a medium sized quick bite spot to a large shaded, artesianal foods with an amazing view of the zoo's largest exhibit containing many African favorites cohabitating in one area. There aren't many food stands or generally opportunities for snacks besides these two spots and the gift shop - wouldnt want to tempt people to feed the animals I guess...I still wish they had Dippin' Dots..

Animals seem well taken care of and there are certainly a variety to be seen. If I could change one exhibit, I'd give the Tiger much more space. Seems a shame but you be the judge.

This zoo is well kept and popular with locals but it really doesn't have that something to it that I would needed to want to keep coming back. It's not bad by any means, just average I think.< /review><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x8094673195546f4b:0xee80b918abd281d6<//gmap_id>< rating>

<text>This zoo is amazing. I remember as a kid when Prop Z was considered thanks to the measure passing this zoo is incredible. I traveled the couple hours to visit the Santa Barbara zoo and was so disappointed. We have a zoo in Atascadero and its so sad how everything is kept. The great changes from the zoo from always been kept tidy to the friendly staff. I don't enjoy other zoo's anymore. Pricing may seem a bit high living in Fresno but its actually half of what of other places charge. The Santa Barbara Zoo was so blah and yet we paid so much more for a whole lot less. If you have nothing to do and you have young ones I highly suggest this place. Its a great way to let them run around and explore a different world.<//text></record>

price of food was too high.
animals looked sad.
some exhibits were closed.
can walk through the whole Zoo in an hour.
boring.
the only good thing about this Zoo is that it's cheap to get in.
it's a one star compared to the San Diego Zoo.< /text>

2 stars for ONE reason. This employee “Sofia” that worked the area with the Sloths and Mata Mata turtles, the humid environment. Was VERY RUDE to my 5 year old son and was speaking to people as if they were stupid. When my 5 year old asked a question. The look she gave my five year old was absotluey Appalling. She looked at him as if he was absolutely STUPID. Unbelievable. I told her; “ he’s 5. He’s not asking  collegiate level type questions”. She assumes everyone is supposed to know everything about that environment. She needs to slow her role or be replaced. She can’t be treating people like that</Review>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>Horrible upsetting experience!!! My first time visiting this small zoo, I assumed it would be worth it especially getting to feed the giraffes. Most animals were sleeping or hidden, mind you it’s mid-morning only! But what made it worse was the employee Karen at the feeding encounter who completely made a scene when we requested to feed the first giraffe to take a memorable photo of my kids feeding the giraffe who stood taller and was able to lean over the ledge. Got into an argument with the Karen as if we were holding up the line after standing in a long line to purchase the lettuce. I even offered to allow others to go ahead of us but she would not stand for it. She refused to allow us to feed the first giraffe, forced us to feed the second giraffe thru the fence. We would probably have to get into the line to buy more lettuce for a chance to get to feed the first giraffe. I understand that you guys are trying to make money but this was for my family memory and due to this awful experience with Karen, we left the zoo, and wasted our money and time.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<review>I love the new look at the zoo.  My parents came to visit from Arkansas with my nephew  and this was is first time ever being to a zoo, so this was a fun day for all of us. Now they just have to update Playland and storyland and add more animal to the vacant areas the animals use to be at. But thumbs up to the zoo.👍👍< /review>< Rating>

The new upgrades to the zoo are insane! The African Safari makes you forget that you are actually still in dirty old Parkside Fresno. Sea Lion Cove, Stingray exhibit, all awesome. You can actually stay here for hours and get tired of walking around. Not at all like the zoo I remember as a kid.</review>

Had a great time, spending our afternoon there for our 49th anniversary. Haven't been there in at least 20 years, except for hauling equipment in and out for Harris Construction. One thing that bothered me is that you have a major problem with a lot of dead trees and limbs that need to be taken care of. They are a major liability,  not only to visitors,  but the animals also. Great job,  great place,  not like I remembered at all. Bob and Patti Groh,  Madera Ranchos.< /Review>

< Review>
Today was our fourth visit and it was incredible. The staff was very friendly and volunteered information all day. And it wasn't just a few employees that went out of their way. Everywhere we went, from the elephants, the llama petting, turtle exhibit, to the sting-rays, all the staff was great. An Asian guy named Mike was just the best, who totally explained to my 3 year old daughter that the turtles just like to wrestle a lot, and to not be alarmed :) he was amazing! We've had bad trips out before, but today was just magic. My thanks to the staff for making our day today one of our most memorable family outing in Fresno.< /Review>

<review>As zoos go I'll as far as to say it's a C+. To start, at it's busiest parking is impossible. The lot arrangement is poor due to it's single entry/exit point, lack of room, and the fact that it is shared by the amusement park across the street. Parking was $5 but I could see it being free when it's not so busy.

The membership to the zoo for a whole family is $99, if you can't decide if you want to buy it in line you can actually pay your normal entry fees and then comeback and have that day's fees go toward the  membership if you do decide to get one. There are, of course, different levels to membership but the gist is you can stroll in on the member line and get 10% off purchases in the zoo.

The zoo itself does have some great exhibits, most of what you'd expect to find at a zoo but some are just a bit lacking. I've only been here a few times so there may be other ways around but from what I can tell there are at least two, maybe more, exhibits that so not have handicap/stroller ramps on one or both sides.

The dining facilities range from a medium sized quick bite spot to a large shaded, artesianal foods with an amazing view of the zoo's largest exhibit containing many African favorites cohabitating in one area. There aren't many food stands or generally opportunities for snacks besides these two spots and the gift shop - wouldnt want to tempt people to feed the animals I guess...I still wish they had Dippin' Dots..

Animals seem well taken care of and there are certainly a variety to be seen. If I could change one exhibit, I'd give the Tiger much more space. Seems a shame but you be the judge.

This zoo is well kept and popular with locals but it really doesn't have that something to it that I would needed to want to keep coming back. It's not bad by any means, just average I think.< /review>< Date>

I've never seen anyone else at this dog park, and it's probably because its location next to the freeway is not appealing to humans, nor does it provide any shade in the large dog park area. With all of the large trees and beautiful areas within Roeding Park, the city could have provided a nicer and much larger area for the many canines and their human companions who live in this area.<//Text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>Zoos okay. Not worth the price nor the entrance fee. Unfortunately, the park is horrible which reflects the zoo. Food overpriced, restrooms not clean, and bad customer service. Did enjoy the new exhibits, yet animals seem unhappy, depressed. Fresno really needs to invest more money into the park and restore some culture back to the city.</text>< Gmap_id>

I live near this zoo and it is the best zoo in the area and since the African exhibit opened it grew of me and my family to visit the zoo and I recommend to absolutely visit this zoo if you live in the Central Valley and visit if you're visiting the Central Valley.</Text>

Probably the best family activity in fresno. Sea lion cove, the rainforest, and African safari are especially great. Some of the old exhibits are a little sad. Annual membership for 2 adults and all children is only $75.<//review>

<review>I hadn't been here since 1999 when it was "Roeding Park Zoo" I wasn't expecting such a great experience! Before we arrived, I figured the kids would be bored, and ready to leave the zoo in an hour. The whole family was impressed, and 3 hours flew by. The Africa exhibit is a truly immersive experience. When you take a picture here, people will think you were in Africa. In addition to many awesome exhibits, you can feed Girraffes, Pet Goats, Touch StingRays, and Sand Sharks. You can even feed a Stingray! Definitely worth checking out!</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I've never seen anyone else at this dog park, and it's probably because its location next to the freeway is not appealing to humans, nor does it provide any shade in the large dog park area. With all of the large trees and beautiful areas within Roeding Park, the city could have provided a nicer and much larger area for the many canines and their human companions who live in this area.<//text>

I haven't been here for maybe 20 years. I was afraid it was going to be the same crappy zoo it used to be. I was wrong. Clean. Well kept and clearly moving away from cages to more open animal friendly habitats. I like the direction they are going. It was worth the stop for a few hours of walking around with the family.< /Text>

Love the new area for the animals to rome. The only reason gave it a star less is San Diego Zoo is still bigger, but Fresno is improving for sure.<//Review>

<name>BH Kidd< /name><Time>1513495586085< /Time><Rating>5< /Rating><text>Until today I hadn't been here for about 7 years or so .  My wife and I took our 2 & 4 year olds today and I was expecting decent zoo and fairly quick trip.  I was amazed at what they've done with the place and my wife and I both agreed that this may now be our favorite zoo in California (and we've done all the major cities).  The new(ish) safari area sold it for us.  All of the animals were out and visible.  Can't be beat for the price imo.  Note:. We didn't purchase any food so I can't speak to that.  Otherwise, easy to get around, something around every corner, not too big, not too small.....very impressed.<//text>< Pics>

This is a great zoo. Recently enrolled my kids in zoo camp (2 hours of driving each day for a week). The photo I took with my kids is one I used on a book cover and had enlarged to put up on my wall.

I've visited often with and without the kids. Regular times and special events - ice cream, behind the scenes, Dia de la Familia, Zoo Boo, Zoo Lights, and Safari Night (adults only).

The zoo keepers are friendly and knowledgeable, care about the animals and give the administration ideas about constantly improving and updating the zoo.

On hot days there is now a kids water play area, and we always visit the reptile house (probably the most comfortable spot in the zoo).

Also recommend venturing up to the African Safari area. Not only is it well done but that's where you'll find the best food in the zoo. Woodfired pizza is our favorite. Then see the cheetahs up close (glass wall). Closer than any other zoo I've visited.

Too many great exhibits and experiences to list. Well worth the visit and certainly an amazing value for a family!</text>

Just got back from this dog park, and we will not be going back. There were a dozen homeless hanging around outside the the fence, with their dogs running loose inside. Two very aggressive dog's were left inside the large dog area, with no one willing to accept the ownership of these animals. Hopefully someone will correct these problems, so responsible people and dog's may use the area.<//text>

< Review>
My experience at the zoo is all the nice staff They are there to answer your questions I LOVE THE ZOO< /Review>
</record></dataset><record>
<Review>I see some reviews complaining about the prices and options for food at the zoo... I always pack a healthy lunch for my kids. Easy fix. You can bring food and drinks into the zoo, just no alcohol and no straws. The one time that I did buy food, I got a Caesar salad in the eatery in African Adventure. It was actually less expensive than I expected it to be, and it was quite large. Couldn't finish it myself. Very tasty.

I love the staff and the animals always  seem happy. (Only exception being a tigress who was in heat and upset that the male wasn't interested.  Poor gal.)

I love the meerkats and the reptile room!! The kids love the dino dig - can't do the zoo without the dino dig!<//Review>< Pics>

I see some reviews complaining about the prices and options for food at the zoo... I always pack a healthy lunch for my kids. Easy fix. You can bring food and drinks into the zoo, just no alcohol and no straws. The one time that I did buy food, I got a Caesar salad in the eatery in African Adventure. It was actually less expensive than I expected it to be, and it was quite large. Couldn't finish it myself. Very tasty.

I love the staff and the animals always  seem happy. (Only exception being a tigress who was in heat and upset that the male wasn't interested.  Poor gal.)

I love the meerkats and the reptile room!! The kids love the dino dig - can't do the zoo without the dino dig!< /text>

We were impressed at the size of zoo.  I would like to make some suggestions. Before that , I want to thank you for free parking for disable persons. Also your discount on senior admission. I was surprised to find you offered no discount for vets with disibilities or seniors on you electric carts. Both could really use a break on the $20 dollar charge. Being a senior myself, it is hard to push my husband around in wheel chair up hills or even flat surfaces.  We came early because of heat. However when it got hot, you had shade to eat in but it was still hot. I would like to suggest miss
ters in several places. Children become quite heated also. Cooling places would really help them. Also in one area where children feed animals, the soap quickly ran out. You have people selling food, maybe someone could help keep an eye on soap too.
We found amimals well cared for and clean areas they lived in. Restrooms also clean. Overall our trip was a good one and we only cut short because of heat for us.  Thank you for asking.</Text>

I was so depressed after visiting this zoo.  I felt so sorry for all the animals.  The grizzly bear was sick, under medical care.  We heard on news two weeks later, she had to be put to sleep.  One of the large galapagos turtles had big pus in corners of both eyes.   The animals looked so sad.  I will not go back to this zoo.<//review>

<text>Our not-quite-2-year-old had a GREAT time at the zoo!  We arrived at opening (9am) and stayed until closing (4pm).  We didn't have time to visit the reptile house, but we spent an hour and a half walking around with a napping toddler in a stroller.  The new African exhibit is amazingly beautiful, and I love that the animals are all together.  The lion cub was out and playing with its mom right up against the glass.  We were definitely impressed by the new zoo additions.  It had probably been 10-15 years since I last visited.

I am only giving 4 stars since, after visiting several zoos over the last couple of years with a little one, there were a few things that struck me during our visit: 1) Zoo staff is not uniformly dressed and in most cases, not easily recognizable.  Most of the staff wore plain, nondescript black jackets.  They might have had the zoo logo on the breast, but that was about it.  When we had a question, we found ourselves wandering around until we heard a [very loud] walkie talkie/radio, which most wear. 2) Bathrooms are few and spread pretty far apart. 3) Many of the animals had old/poor descriptions or even no description at all.  There were a few exhibits that had no signs with any information about the animals.  There are scheduled talks about some of the more popular animals, but I have been to other zoos that have signs that mention the animals by name, talk about their background, etc., in addition to the information about the species, and it's really much nicer.  4) What happened to all the birds in the Rainforest?  I remember as a kid the Rainforest was AMAZING because there were birds everywhere.  During our recent visit, we only saw a small assortment of ducks, a couple other species, and the macaws.

Overall, we had a great time at the zoo.  One thing did strike me and make me sad, though, and that is all the signs with the number to call if you see someone abusing the animals.  I thought, "Do people really do that?"  Apparently, it's enough of a problem that the signs are necessary.  So sad.</text><user>100969272559922162758</user></record></dataset><record>

Our not-quite-2-year-old had a GREAT time at the zoo!  We arrived at opening (9am) and stayed until closing (4pm).  We didn't have time to visit the reptile house, but we spent an hour and a half walking around with a napping toddler in a stroller.  The new African exhibit is amazingly beautiful, and I love that the animals are all together.  The lion cub was out and playing with its mom right up against the glass.  We were definitely impressed by the new zoo additions.  It had probably been 10-15 years since I last visited.

I am only giving 4 stars since, after visiting several zoos over the last couple of years with a little one, there were a few things that struck me during our visit: 1) Zoo staff is not uniformly dressed and in most cases, not easily recognizable.  Most of the staff wore plain, nondescript black jackets.  They might have had the zoo logo on the breast, but that was about it.  When we had a question, we found ourselves wandering around until we heard a [very loud] walkie talkie/radio, which most wear. 2) Bathrooms are few and spread pretty far apart. 3) Many of the animals had old/poor descriptions or even no description at all.  There were a few exhibits that had no signs with any information about the animals.  There are scheduled talks about some of the more popular animals, but I have been to other zoos that have signs that mention the animals by name, talk about their background, etc., in addition to the information about the species, and it's really much nicer.  4) What happened to all the birds in the Rainforest?  I remember as a kid the Rainforest was AMAZING because there were birds everywhere.  During our recent visit, we only saw a small assortment of ducks, a couple other species, and the macaws.

Overall, we had a great time at the zoo.  One thing did strike me and make me sad, though, and that is all the signs with the number to call if you see someone abusing the animals.  I thought, "Do people really do that?"  Apparently, it's enough of a problem that the signs are necessary.  So sad.<//review>

<Review>I grew up going to the zoo. It was always a special treat to go see Nosey the elephant.  I still miss him. I have grown up, I am now 57 an!d live in Oregon. I love the zoo! I always have and always wil. Thanks to this great zoo no matter where we travel I always want to find the nearest zoo !. All because of the Fresno zoo! P.s. I love storyland too !!!<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>There's quite a bit to do at roeding Park. You can visit the zoo, go to storyland, ride the rides at Playland, and/or play in the water at Playland. You can have the kids play at one of the parks within roeding park, or you could just relax with family and bbq!< /Review></record>

Great park with a wide variety of mature trees covered and noncovered picnic/BBQ locations, tennis courts, memorials,  statues ponds, open grass fields, dog park ect.
Not to forget home to The Chaffee Zoo with the recently opened African Adventure(awesome)
Also within the part is Playland and Storyland.</Review>

I really wanted to give it a 5 stars but the only reason for 4 is the food ,is kind of expensive 1 bottle of water is 2:50 ,I suggest taking some snacks and water .they been adding more attraction so there are more things to see.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) The zoo is great. Very clean, well-groomed animals. We really liked that you can feed the giraffes. Everyone was delighted. It is very interesting to watch elephants. Everywhere there is a good view and you can safely observe the animals. There are several fast food zones on the territory of the zoo. If you are tired, there are many places to sit and relax.

(Original)
Зоопарк великолепный. Очень чистый, животные ухоженные. Нам очень понравилось что можно покормить жирафов. Были в восторге все. Очень интересно наблюдать за слонами. Везде хороший обзор и можно спокойно наблюдать за животными. На территории зоопарка есть несколько зон фастфудов. Если вы устали то есть много мест где можно посидеть и отдохнуть.</Review>

<username>Marco C.</username><Date>1575888700170</Date><Rate>4< /Rate><Text>(Translated by Google) We were traveling from San Francisco to Exeter to visit the Sequoia National Park and, to break the long journey, we decided to stop in Frasno and visit the Zoo. It was never more appropriate choice! Really beautiful, full of animals of every species, very large and with many attractions (to eat giraffes, walk in the cage of kangaroos, brush the goats). I remember it was really hot, so bring a hat and plenty of ice water. Great food also point to the zoo, the prices were affordable so you can safely stop for lunch and then leave.

Eravamo in viaggio da San Francisco a Exeter per visitare il Sequoia National Park e, per spezzare il lungo viaggio, abbiamo deciso di fermarci a Frasno e visitare lo Zoo. Mai scelta fu più azzeccata! Veramente bello, pieno di animali di ogni specie, molto grande e con tante attrazioni (far mangiare le giraffe, camminare nella gabbia dei canguri, spazzolare le caprette). Ricordo che faceva veramente caldo, quindi portate un berretto e tanta acqua ghiacciata. Ottimo anche il punto ristorazione dello Zoo, i prezzi erano abbordabili quindi potete tranquillamente fermarvi per il pranzo e poi ripartire.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMP2zWFyzfw7qSEHs5j3inscQphuVKef-Y2romu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGeHk_YyYxJl8OHli6mOwPfCB_mmcMlENgggqM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

(Translated by Google) Wow! I visited this place 6 year ago and The last weekend, the different is amazing! They still fixing some areas but the place for lions and Africans species is really beautiful. The animal are well care and they have a large spaces. Prices are reasonable for entrance but if you want to feed the animal. You have to pay 5 dollars per 3 pieces of lettuce for 🦒 and 6 dollars for the dinosaurs tour. The place for birds are nice to look exactly like jungle. Just one thing to observation: they don't respect disability conditions people or caregivers! San Diego and los angels zoo don’t charge anything if you are helping to people with wheelchair!
I visited this place six years ago and this weekend I was in for a big surprise! The renovations and arrangements for the African animal area is very nice and big! They are still fixing other areas but you can still enjoy some animals! The animals are well cared for. And they look great! Prices are reasonable for entry but you have to pay $ 5 to get three lettuce leaves and feed the giraffes and $ 6 for the dinosaur tour! If you bring dependent or disabled people, do not wait for them to have redoeto or consideration with them or with the caregivers! In other places people who require wheelchairs only pay their entrance and the caregivers or caregivers are exempt from the payment but this zoo does not! If you have plans to visit the place, I suggest you wait for the repairs to finish! Parking costs $ 5 but axle plate cars do not pay! Very good for this consideration!

Visite este lugar hace seis años y este fin de semana me encontré con una gran sorpresa! Las renovaciones y arreglos para el area de los animales africanos es muy bonita y grande!  Todavía están arreglando otras áreas pero aún  puedes disfrutar de algunos animales!  Lis animales están bien cuidados. Y se ven muy bien! Los precios son razonables para la entrada pero tienes que pagar 5 dólares para obtener tres hojas de lechuga y alimentar a las jirafas y 6 dólares por el tour de los dinosaurios! Si llevar personas dependientes o con deshabilitases no esperes a que tengan redoeto o consideración con ellos ni con los cuidadores!  En otros lugares las personas que requieren sillas de ruedas solo pagan su entrada y lis cuidadores o caregivers están excentos del pago pero este  zoológico no!  Si tienes planes de visitar el lugar te sugiero que  esperes a que terminen las reparaciones!  El estacionamiento cuesta 5 dólares pero los carros con  placa axil no pagan !  Muy bien por esta consideración!< /Review>

(Translated by Google) We were traveling from San Francisco to Exeter to visit the Sequoia National Park and, to break the long journey, we decided to stop in Frasno and visit the Zoo. It was never more appropriate choice! Really beautiful, full of animals of every species, very large and with many attractions (to eat giraffes, walk in the cage of kangaroos, brush the goats). I remember it was really hot, so bring a hat and plenty of ice water. Great food also point to the zoo, the prices were affordable so you can safely stop for lunch and then leave.

Eravamo in viaggio da San Francisco a Exeter per visitare il Sequoia National Park e, per spezzare il lungo viaggio, abbiamo deciso di fermarci a Frasno e visitare lo Zoo. Mai scelta fu più azzeccata! Veramente bello, pieno di animali di ogni specie, molto grande e con tante attrazioni (far mangiare le giraffe, camminare nella gabbia dei canguri, spazzolare le caprette). Ricordo che faceva veramente caldo, quindi portate un berretto e tanta acqua ghiacciata. Ottimo anche il punto ristorazione dello Zoo, i prezzi erano abbordabili quindi potete tranquillamente fermarvi per il pranzo e poi ripartire.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Magnificent zoo. Especially the area of ​​Africa. At the moment it relaxes you, much better than any massage! Magnificent views from the restaurant. We arrived at 12pm until 4pm. Just to see it all.
Very easy to get to from anywhere in the city by public transport.
Ideal if you have a few hours left in Fresno and you don't know what to do.
Ideal for children.

Magnífic zoo. Especialment la zona d'africa. Al moment et relaxa, molt millor que qualsevol massatge! Magnifiques vistes desde el restaurant. Vam arribar a les 12h fins les 16h. Justet per a veure-ho tot.
Molt fàcil d'arribar desde qualsevol part de la ciutat amb transport public.
Ideal si et sobren unes hores a Fresno i no saps que fer.
Ideal per anar amb nens.</review>

<review>(Translated by Google) The price is pretty high. But I saw that the animals z. B. from Africa have a much larger enclosure than in other zoos. The animals do not look as if they are feeling bad or missing something.
I had fun at the zoo and I recommend it to anyone who has children ...

(Translated by Google) An absolute dream zoo. We paid $ 25 for 2 adults. For parking 7 dollars. The zoo is clean and bigger than I expected. In addition, a lot is offered. There are many walk-in halls. Most animals have a presentation. For a small surcharge, you can stroke rays or feed giraffes. The food in the park is good and the price is fair. The stretches for the animals are big and beautiful.

Die Verpflegung im Park ist gut und der Preis fair. Die Gehäge für die Tiere sind gross und schön.< /text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The park is beautiful, has a lot of space, children and puppies have a lot of fun. Well, we all have fun. The only thing that worries me is that I saw homeless people.

El parque es bonito, tiene mucho espacio, los Niños y perritos se divierten mucho. Bueno, todos nos divertimos. Lo unico que me preocupo es que vi indigentes.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Horrible do not come there is nothing to see and part everything is super expensive ... they charge as if it were 5 dollars the entrance to the park 15 per adult and 9 per child and part buy drinks and food super expensive a mini pizza $ 10 ... hopefully someone regulate this because they speculate on prices

(Original)
Horrible no vengan no hay nada que ver y a parte todo esta super caro... cobran como si fuera 5 dolares la entrada al parque 15 por adulto y 9 por niño y a parte comprar bebidas y comida super caro un mini pizza $10 ... ojala alguien regule esto porque especulan con los precios</text>

<text>(Translated by Google) It is a fun place, and more for my children, I have fun with them watching the animals, being in the zoo is a good place to be together, or seeing the nature of God, it is beautiful ..
