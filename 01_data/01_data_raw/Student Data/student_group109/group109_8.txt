<review>The team at Schuck’s are amazing.  My family and I were moving and in a tight time restraint to pick up a cap over camper out of state.  Schuck’s went out of there way to make our trip happen.  They diagnosed, repaired and delivered our truck with a new transmission in days, even traveling to intercept a part stuck in transit. I can’t thank them enough for hard work and dedication.  I will definitely call upon them for any future needs I might have.<//review>< pics>

<text>Took my 88 Ford Bronco 2 to Schuck's Transmission a few weeks ago after AAMCO botched a rebuild in 2012. Jeff and his team were very courteous. Jeff took the time to hear me out about the 2-3 shift flare and how I had tried the band adjustment and shift modulator replacement with no improvement before I decided to bring it in for professional repair. Jeff was honest with me about the amount of work it would need. After the repairs, I was able to get a box of the parts that were replaced. While the transmission was being rebuilt, they also replaced the flywheel due to some broken teeth. I inspected their work afterwards and was very pleased to the attention to detail. The shift adjustment nuts on this A4LD are prone to loosening so I saw that Jeff's team had put some gasket on thise after adjustment.

Lesson learned, don't take your transmission to AAMCO for a cheap rebuild. Schuck's has been a good experience and Jeff was willing to take my calls and answer any questions I had. He even provided me with the manuals for the shift kit they installed to improve the shifting after rebuild. I also saw the aftermath of the botched rebuild in the worn bands and worn out center support that was replaced.

I can rest easy now that Schuck's transmission did the job right.</text>< Pictures>

I took my vehicle to Shucks Transmission for transmission work after reviewing the online business referrals.  Initially I was a little apprehensive since this was not a personal reference.  Based on the good service and workmanship provided, I would definitely recommend the business.  The thing that stuck with me the most was their honesty and the fact that they honored their warranty without issue.< /Text>

I had my transmission replaced in my 2009 JKU wrangler by Schucks. I cannot say enough good things about this shop. They went above and beyond my expectations, and not once did I have any doubts about the service I was receiving. This was a performance/mod scenario, and they delivered! Jeep is running great now, and I'm still discovering little items that they went above and beyond and corrected for me, when they could have easily just said thats not my problem. Thanks again! You have a new lifetime customer now!</review>

Went in for a P0340 (camshaft position sensor) & P0401 insufficient exhaust recirculation).  Knowledgeable staff, knew exactly what I was speaking of on the phone unlike three others left unnamed.  The job was correctly at a good price and in a timely fashion.  Good job guys!  The 96' green Ranger is running great!  Cheers!</text>

Schuck's Transmission is on point! I won't go anywhere else and you shouldn't either if you want loyal A+ Technicians and people you can trust handling your repairs. They've been a staple in the East bay for decades, come highly recommended by many in the race and performance field and they deliver on their reputation. A big thanks to Jeff and company for their honesty and skill.

<Review>Purchased a remanufactured transmission for my Explorer. Schuck's made sure that I had fluid, gaskets and everything needed for the installation, all included. I was back on the road in less than a week. Fair prices and a well run shop. Drove an hour and a half to get that transmission and will do it again when I need my next one. Highly recommend.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

300% MARKUP on parts used during repair and a THREE WEEK turnaround time? What an embarrassment of a shop. I've waited several months to write this review so that I could evaluate the work done on my automobile. With that said, I highly recommend that you take your automobile elsewhere. It's wise to look outside of the tri-valley area, because the local shops here will rip you off. My classic car was returned to me in an arguably worse condition. It certainly drives a lot worse than when I handed it over to Robert--horrible vibrations. He then had the audacity to justify mark-ups on parts that were ordered from a manufacturer's website (see the attached image). Furthermore, I was never asked which replacement parts I wanted installed on my vehicle. The shop only called me to update the process a single time; I initiated almost all communication during this drawn out process. The total cost was about $500 over-budget (see the attached picture of the poorly written ticket). I don't even think I should make a warranty claim with Schuck's... I'd hate to let my car go for another two months. If you must go to a local shop, go to Broadway motors located on the same block as Schuck's. Do not get scammed here. My friends and I don't call it Schuck's, or truck's, or luck's.... starts with a C!<//text>

I feel like these guys are incredibly honest folks.  The original quote was significantly less than competing repair shop, and the final price came back  well under their own quote. They worked with my budget and did a great job!!</Review>

<Date>1619899219311</Date><rating>5</rating><Text>Just had Phillip from Precision Garage Door repair my door. I was very impressed by his service and requested he send me a review link. He was knowledgeable, professional, polite and personable. Fixed the problem and spent time to show me how to lubricate and care for my garage door to minimize repairs in the future. I contacted Precision at 11:30AM ..problem fixed by 1PM. Customer service was easily reached with no waiting time. I am one happy customer!
Thank you Precision and Philip😊<//Text>< UserId.>

The tech (Phillip) was knowledgeable and talked me through the spring's wear and tear profile and then the plate which had its bearings worn out.
While service was efficient, and timely - i didn't give it a 5-star because it ended up costing twice as the original estimate. While it was for reasons that i understand i would have appreciated knowing this ahead of time.
Attached is the Precision supplied spring that was replaced after it was torqued.
Thank you for your prompt and precise service.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNraXVSCH8OlV1ueR6WPjOi5sMzQBwN2EzlzcDe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><user_name>Prasana Iyengar<//user_name><date>1605458401682</date>< gmap_id>

Phillip was our technician.  He was a pleasure to have work on our home.  He was very informative and thorough.  He had to install a new motor to open our garage door.  We called this morning and this afternoon our garage door is working.  He even cleaned up and took away all the waste parts. So glad we called..we Hail from Montara, California and its not always easy to get service to our area. Thank you So much!<//text>

Great service.  Garage door had a slight opening on one of the sides.  Philip from precision door service came on times. Identified everything that was causing that issue but also everything that had gone unnoticed over the years and had degraded.  Explained things carefully,  Gave me options of what the different quotes to fix were and got done with everything in about an hour.</text>

They lived up to their promise of coming on the same day if called by 1 PM... on a Sunday.

They did an excellent job of repairing my garage door which had gone off it's track. They also did some preventive maintenance.

The workers were professional and polite. I highly recommend this company.</text>

Sheridan from precision door service replaced our busted garage door opener. He arrived right on time. Right off the bat he pointed out issues with the previous install and instead of simply replacing the parts he walked me through the various options and explained them. The install was completed in a couple hours with minimum fuss. It's been a few weeks and everything is working just fine.< /review>

<review>We called in the morning (on a Saturday) for a broken Garage door spring, and were told a technician would be out between 4 and 6.  Phillip Nguyen arrived at 4:00.  He went right to work, gave awesome recommendations with options on pricing for parts, and was finished within the hour.  Phillip was very polite and adhered to all COVID Guidelines. Very appreciative for Precision Door Services!</review>< user_name>

The repair man assessed the issue & was able to make the repairs inspite of the difficult location and a car that could not be moved. Another company came but refused the job as they thought they could not do the repair until I move a car on racks.  Precision knew what was needed & even condationed the working parts to provide an updated  better, quiter & smoother opperation before he left.
I am  happy customer.<//Text>< name>

Jess was really good; he had me scheduled in less than five (5) minutes.
But I was really impressed with the repair dispatch!!
"Sheridan", my technician, was just the best service tech one could be assigned!!
He called to let me know he was on the way.  He reviewed the issues with my door.  He reviewed all my repair options and gave me a cost estimate.

Finally, he was able to repair my door and opener in the same visit.

We hired precision to come out and look at our garage door which had numerous issues and was no longer rolling up or down, which is no fun. I was able to get a same day appointment and was surprised at how pleasant and easy the scheduling was on such short notice.

Alex was sent out within a matter of a couple of hours, and immediately went to work to see what was going on. Not only was Alex incredibly kind and extremely informative on what he was seeing, his quality of work is amazing.

No one plans for their garage door to break down during the holidays, but If they do, this is the place to call! (ask for Alex!)

While it was an unexpected, it was so much more than we originally thought was. Each time he’d fix one thing, another issue would present itself, but Alex once again made sure we knew what was happening and walked us through each step ensuring we were comfortable and happy along the way.

I cannot express how pleased we are with the work! Even when it was brand new, it wasn’t as smooth and quiet as it is now. All thanks to Alex and his dedication to quality work and happy customers!!</Text>

My old garage door opener had stopped working reliably, but I wasn't exactly sure whether it needed to be replaced or what I should get instead. I called Precision and they sent someone out the same afternoon (!). Alex Kogan was super helpful and professional, diagnosed my system and explained what I needed and what my options were in a way that made me feel confident I was getting good advice and good quality equipment. I had done a bit of research online and they had different stuff than I originally thought I needed, but ultimately what they had was a better choice, so I'm glad I listened. They had all the equipment on board so I didn't need to order anything in advance.

It took longer than expected to install all the new stuff (not his fault, just a complex setup in my garage) and he stayed late into the evening to get it all done right. The new system has been working great since then, and I will definitely call these guys back next time I need anything done. Highly recommended!< /Text>

<text>This was a bait and switch scam. The claim their trip/service fees are low but then charged another $99 for a five minute programming fee for my elderly mother’s garage door opener. Will never recommend this company to anyone!!< /text>< pics>

<review>Daniel Yang spent the time to make sure I understood the features of my new smart garage door opener and how to program it. He made sure that I understood what periodic maintenance I would need to do (lubrication, location and schedule) to keep the door working properly. I appreciated his patience as I asked many questions regarding how the new openers now work given that my last opener was from more than 20 years ago. I'm so thankful that I called Precision Door to help me with this small request.</review></record>

<Review>My garage door got jammed on a tool I had hanging on the wall. I couldn’t fix it myself and didn’t want to leave my garage door open to all. I called Precision, and they sent their technician Paul out. Paul kept me informed of his eta, and was prompt in getting to my house. His knowledge of his craft was excellent. He took care of the problem and identified and corrected another  potential one gratis. I highly recommend him and precision, unless you want to keep your junk in your trunk.<//Review>< gmap_id>

<resp>None< /resp><Pics>None</Pics><Review>First and foremost, I am very impressed with Precision Overhead Garage Door Service as a whole and especially technician Alex Kogan.

Alex arrived within the prescribed time window and immediately asked about my garage door issues.  Alex reviewed the entire garage door system, right down to the individual track wheels, looking and listening areas of improper wear and contact. After my system was inspected, Alex provided me with a written estimate via his tablet computer.  The estimate was comprehensive and itemized.  After the removal of the old torsion springs Alex brought to my attention the uneven wear on the outer-bearings.  Alex showed me the difference between my worn bearings a what a good bearing should look like.  Upon my approval, Alex revised the written estimate on his tablet and went right back to work.

At the conclusion of the service call, Alex walked me through all the features of the new opener that included setting the date/time, programming the remotes as well as how the battery back-up works and how to manually open the garage door. Lastly, Alex reviewed areas where preventative maintenance can be done on the door hinges and wheels.

Granted this was an unexpected expense but when it comes right down to it you get what you pay for—quality service and peace of mind.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I called on Friday about getting a new garage opener for my condo building and was given an appointment time on Saturday between 8-noon.  I got a call at 8am from Paul to let me know that he was on his way and will arrive in approx. 45 minutes.  He arrived on time.  He assessed the current setup and let me know about the additional work that should be done which I thought was reasonable.  His work was thorough, professional, tidy, and timely.  After the installation, he explained how the manual mode worked and set up the remotes and keypads.  All in all, a job well done.  Thanks.<//Review><user_name>L Ferrer<//user_name><resp>None< /resp><Rate>5<//Rate>< pics>

<Review>Our garage door suddenly broke.  We are selling our house and needed to get it fixed fast.  Alex from Precision Door showed up within a couple of hours.  He had the necessary parts on his truck, fixed the opener in no time at all and at a very affordable price.  I would highly recommend Alex and Precision Door Service.  I don't think we've ever had a home repair done so fast and pain free.  5 stars to Alex and PDS!!!!!!< /Review>< pics>

Our repairman, Jerry, was fantastic! He arrived in a timely fashion, assessed the problem with the garage door that wouldn’t open (purchased at least 25-30 years ago) and gave me a cost estimate as well as length of time he needed to fix it. He almost rebuilt the entire door system and it’s now better than new. He had all parts necessary on his truck so was able to finish right then. I’m very, very pleased!< /text>

After work was done he provided complete training to my tenants and I. Also he helped with programming the two remotes, and the remote in my car which was greatly appreciated. Overall he is topnotch technician with superb customer service and communication skills.< /Review>< Pics>

We needed to replace the bottom panel of our garage door. We called the Precision and they kindly sent the gentleman named Mike Munoz to our house for estimation. Mike took a look at our garage door and said that Precision doesn't offer sectional replacement, but he referred to other local business that can offer the service we need. I deeply appreciate his honesty and professionalism!<//review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Jerry from Precision Door Service made the repairs a breeze. Not only was Precision Door Service easy to call (live service, real person on the line who asks all the right questions) and schedule a repair for a broken spring (and other things) but Jerry's passion and care put me at ease. I like to repair what I can but I know something like this is beyond my skillset. Jerry's experience and inspection never made me feel rushed and I could tell he is a trustworthy and knowledgeable repairman. He also walked me through other parts that needed or would need repair and I can't even begin to describe how comfortable I felt after issues were brought to my attention. I'm beyond satisfied with the level of service, attention, and professionalism Jerry and Precision Door Service offer.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Brandon was the best.  Assessed the situation, repaired problems with our existing garage door, then installed a brand new LiftMaster with battery backup and all the trimmings.  Very knowledgeable and pleasant to work with.  He settled for nothing but the best and most professional installation.  I will always call Precision Door Service, and I will always ask for Brandon.< /Text>

Great service.  Very easy and efficient to make an appt. had a minor issue with my door though after it was installed. So had to get another guy to come out a few days later, his name was Jerry.  I have never seen anyone work like Jerry did. He was extremely thorough and double and triple checking every inch of the door that was installed by another Precision worker making sure everything was good. The minor issue was the rubber on the bottom track. Jerry fixed it very fast. Also Jerry greased all the hinges and tracks and explained to me how to and reasons for doing it every 6 months. I highly recommend Precision to install your garage door.</Text>

Jerry the technician went beyond my expectations while replacing a 35 year old motor unit. He completely serviced the door including re-mounting of the door mount bracket to a more solid location. He also serviced our other garage door. They both function perfectly now. I am very satisfied and will continue to use Precision Door Service!</Review>

Called mid-day and got an appointment for the next morning.  James W. was assigned to my repair call.  He was right on time, polite and  knowledgeable.  He pointed out exactly what I needed, plus made a recommendation for another maintenance item that might be needed.  I probably would have done it if it was a more heavily used garage door.  No problem, no hard sell, repair completed in less than an hour.  Very happy and will use again if I ever need another repair.< /Review>

<Response>None< /Response><Text>I appreciate Mario so much.  He was very professional; he called to let me know he would be arriving in 15 minutes.  I will note, he called earlier, but I went outside to dump recycle. Mario was patient, understanding and oh so professional.  Thank you Mario.  Because of him, I will call Precision Door Service only when I need assistance with my garage door again.  I promise.
Thank you Mario.< /Text></record>

<Text>Mike Munoz gave my dad and I excellent customer service.  Went over several options for our one car garage. We called several other companies, and this company gave us the best price, and I’m happy with the price that Mike gave us. Overall more than satisfied , and 100% would do business again! Thanks again Mike!<//Text>< Pics>

Alex Kogan did a fine job refurbishing my garage door.  Honestly, I have no idea whether he took me for a ride or not.  What I thought would be a $100 fine tune turned into a $1500 update to several key components of the door.  But given that these parts likely haven’t been replaced in over 30 years, I trusted his judgment and went with his recommendations.  He did take the time to explain each element and particular issue with me, and got my understanding and consent on everything before proceeding — and given the generally very high reviews for this  business I went with it.  Either way, he was professional, friendly, on time, got all the work done on the same day, left the place clean, and gave some good inside tips for ongoing maintenance.  So assuming this takes care of any current issues and prevents other potential upcoming issues (I’m all about preventing issues before they hit), then it was all money well spent. Oh, and extra brownie points for the fact that they were out just one day after my initial call.  Thanks for the professional job!</review>

<Review>The cable on the garage door stopped working and I was stuck at home, as the car was in garage. I called Precision and they sent Paul Brinkman out within 2 hours. He quickly quoted me and got to work. He not only replaced cable and necessary parts, he also added extra parts and service for longevity... Paul went above and beyond getting my garage door to work the night before Thanksgiving! I appreciate the personal consideration and customer service. Thank You, Paul & Precision!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fcbe5ff2edbb9:0x12420b2b6862ece3</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Our technician Josh was outstanding!!  He was on time, friendly, very knowledgeable, and really made the experience a great one!!  Painless garage door repair with a quote given that was easily understood and fair.  Josh explained everything and was not pushy on sales or trying to sell more than what was needed.  I would highly recommended Precision Door, specifically Josh here in San Francisco.

<Review>Mike Munoz ‘s proposal came alive as our new electric garage door on May 13. We love it and are so grateful to him.
Mike’s expertise and patience guiding me through options — materials, appearance, insulation, windows, chain driven motor (super quiet!), etc. —
manifested a garage system beyond my expectations.
The wise choice of vendors is Precision Doors so you will have the same experience and quality I did.
Quality and price are closely linked. Give yourself the best.</Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808fcbe5ff2edbb9:0x12420b2b6862ece3<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>I was three days without my garage door opening.  I finally called Precision Door Service on Monday late afternoon and Tuesday morning around 9:30a.m. James W. And Garrett R. arrived.  In seconds described what I needed.  Within an hour replaced unit, rollers, and a programed door opener.  These two were so pleasant trustworthy and polite.  It truly was a 5 star rating.  Quiet beyond words.

He was extremely knowledgeable and clarified several issues immediately. His advice was sound, and his installation fast, thorough, and very professional. He gave us a lot of information about the proper care and upkeep of doors, and even went across the Bay to get the key fobs we wanted, which he delivered the next day without additional cost.  I think we are very fortunate he responded to our emergency call.

Paul Brinkman with Precision Garage Doors was recently at my home repairing my garage door. He called twice to estimate and announce his arrival, much appreciated. He corrected the problem with the door and was also able to replace the very old and faulty garage door opener which had been  problematic for years. What a difference that has made and I am now battery protected for opening IF my power is shut off. He worked very hard and diligently, cleaned up thoroughly after, walked me through a thorough instruction on the new opener and was a delight to talk with and also shared many helpful general tips with me - also much appreciated. I could not have been more satisfied or pleased with the service.</text>

My garage door began shrieking like a banshee while opening or lowering. I called Precision Door on Friday and got an appointment for Monday morning.
On Monday I got a call from service tech Paul advising me as to his ETA.
He ended up getting held up in a far more extensive job then anticipated with the client before me and my appointment was pushed to the end of the afternoon.
That couldn’t be helped but I really appreciated the frequent updates Paul provided, his polite and matter-of-fact demeanor and his lack of exaggeration on what time he expected to get to my house.  A person can plan around long delays but not around overly optimistic or unreasonable updates.
Upon arrival the issue was quickly assessed and repaired and 20 minutes later I no longer had a garage door that screamed like a cat in heat.
Price was reasonable but not what I would call rock bottom cheap. Since it wasn’t something I could do myself it is what it is.  You pay for someone else’s expertise not just the parts used.
The work he did was clean and expertly performed.
What you need to know is that when you call for an appointment you are calling a call center that, in my case, is not even located in the same state. The scheduler cannot give you any door advise, they simply look for a contractor working for Precision that is in your area.  The definition of “in your area” includes wide swathes of territory and that caller has no clue where you are in relation to where the tech is coming from, hence the very wide service window.  Whoever is going to service the door calls you the day of appointment for a shorter window and updates as they progress.  So I would say the weak link in the chain is the call center since your actual appointment may be far different than what they estimate when you make the first call.  May be earlier or, in my case, may be at the opposite end of the sunrise sunset continuum.  🤷‍♀️< /Text>

<Text>Paul was very helpful with our recent need of garage door opener repairs. He clearly diagnosed the issue and was able to return after the weekend to make the necessary repairs. All work performed was as he estimated; there were no add’l parts, charges or services. I would highly recommend Precision Garage Door for such repairs and maintenance.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>Our technician Brandon was on-time and quickly diagnosed several issues, beyond the obviously broken spring, on our garage door.  He explained clearly how various parts had been prematurely worn due to an undersized spring that had been previously installed.  He went above and beyond to work around and protect a car that we were unable to move in the garage and then also lubricated and tuned both the main door that he was fixing AND our third garage door and opener.  Truly outstanding customer service in my opinion.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>I had my garage door serviced by Paul Brinkman of Precision Garage Doors.

I spent over two decades in the corporate world as a sales and marketing executive for two Fortune 500 retail companies as well as a retail start up company.  I also held two high level political positions and recently retired from Law Enforcement as a Deputy Sheriff.  I believe I can do a good job of judging people’s characters, motives and evaluating a company’s customer service.

Paul Brinkman gave me an excellent first impression.  He was professional, precise and did a very good job of communicating my options to complete the repair. He was not pushy which was important to me.  He explained my options in easily understandable terms and answered all of my questions.  Paul came across as being honest and sincere.

Paul’s engineering skills and people skills proved to be a good fit for his career.

In regards to Precision Garage Doors, I noted the following:

The person I spoke with on the phone to schedule the job was professional and courteous.  She immediately made me feel confident in choosing Precision.  Along with a user friendly and well written website to a clean service truck showed that Precision takes pride in their work.

I would highly recommend Precision Garage Door to my friends and would hope they get lucky and get Paul as their service person.</Text>< Time>

Garage door suddenly broke one morning and needed it fixed right away, Alex from Precision Door service did exactly that and more. Not only fixing the issues at hand, but also took a little time to educate me on simple things I didn’t know about (an example is how the drums and cables worked together and how to properly lubricate the bearings and everything) He was an extreme help to the family for getting the door fixed and working again!< /Review>

Great and quick job. With 0 surprises. We had previously arrange (and paid before hand) the job with Home Depot but their installation company came in and rejected to set up the automatic garage door opener with some weird excuses. Paul came in today Saturday, assessed the situation and set the automatic garage door opener súper quickly. We are very pleased, works great.100% recommended<//text>

Phillip N - Arrived right on time. We had two Coleman lifts that were giving us problems. We wanted everything to be ship shape and he gave us a list of essential repairs that would have been very reasonably priced.

We pressed him for a complete replacement of the two motors and again the price appeared very reasonable. He offered us several discounts because we would be replacing two systems.

We then asked for a quote on a state of the art upgrade where we could check in on the status of the doors on our cell phones. He gave us another quote which was very reasonable considering the work to be done. He did an excellent job installing everything and even fixing a few problems we had with our doors.

He walked us through all the instructions and was very patient to make sure we understood the instructions. He also showed us self maintenance we could do ourselves.

He did all the work in less than one day.

He substantially exceeded our expectations.</text>

I needed a new spring installed for my garage door. On the scheduled day, Mario called and said he would arrive in 30 minutes. He show up exactly 30 minutes later. He completed the work in less than 1 hour and changed only the necessary parts. I would use them again if needed.< /Review>

<review>We needed our garage door checked and we weren’t very happy with the first technician that tried to fix ii in a rush. After just a week, we had the same problem again so I called Precision about it and long story short, they sent a technician right away to check our garage door. They sent Philip who is very different from the other guy. He was patient and checked our garage door opener thoroughly. He took his time and made sure all our concerns  were addressed . Precision garage got my confidence back, thanks to Philip. From 1 star to 5 stars. Two thumbs up for a very great customer service.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Michael came out from Precision Door Service to repair our garage door opener. Michael was very professional and friendly while at our home. He shared what was wrong with the door opener and why. He made the repair in a timely manner and charged a fair price. I will not hesitate to call Precision Door Service in the future and will refer them to our family and friends.< /Review>

Our garage door stopped working when one of the hinges broke. I called Precision because of their great reviews, and now I can why they got them! Brandon was out to see me first thing the next morning. He was on time, gave me an estimate and fixed it within the next 90 minutes. The garage door works like new with nearly all the parts replaced (after 40 years!). Brandon showed me how and what to lubricate every 6 months for some basic care and reminded me that they have a 5 year guarantee too. Thanks Brandon!</Text>

Team arrived when promised and replaced the torsion system and track rollers with all new parts. Our 30 year old garage door now operates better and smoother than it did when it was brand new.  Excellent.....5 stars. Highly recommend Precision Door for outstanding job on our upgrade.< /review>

Our garage door got damaged when i was pulling out the Car.
Alex from precision door came in this morning and did a superb job of repairing the door which prevented the need to replace the door (more inconvenience and cost) and used his smarts as a technician to repair the door and get it working.
He is not only good at his job but also is focused on helping the client solve the problem and has excellent disposition to treat his clients with respect and care.
Love the company which employs people like alex<//Review>

<review>We had a manufacturing defect on a panel for the door purchased from Precision. They were prompt in sending their expert, Jerry Parker to inspect. He quickly assessed that it was a defect and put in a replacement order. Once the order was ready, Jerry arrived a few minutes early and waited for us. He was courteous and great in finishing the job. Our door is new again and without any defect! Thank you, Jerry!</review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Just had a great experience with our garage tech.  He was all about customer service. We had gotten a quote for a new motor,  but when Brian?
came to the house he assured us that we had a good motor, no need to replace.  Would definitely recommend Brian and Precision Door!< /review>

<text>Jerry is the best. My garage door had been neglected for year and finally a bolt came off last night and the whole thing sounded like it was going to fall apart. You kind of take your garage door for granted, until the night when it starts to fall apart and you can't lock it, and you feel like you're sleeping with one eye open. But Jerry to the rescue - he came first thing this morning, fixed the problem, lubed it up, re-positioned some pieces, and re-programmed the remote.  He was super friendly, straight forward and reasonable.</text>< user>

When I saw that my garage door was visibly laboring to open and was not aligning properly, I knew I needed to be proactive and call for repair before the situation got worse. I called Precision. I had used them before and they did a great job then. Mario and Alex came today at the appointed time and did a fantastic job repairing the problem in a very timely and professional manner. Their work today, I'm sure saved me thousands of dollars and lots of inconvenience if I let the door eventually breakdown completely. Thanks guys and thanks Precision.</text>

<Review>Paul came to evaluate our garage door opener. The door opened but the motor would not stop running. He immediately determined that he would not be able to repair the motor as the unit was likely from the 1950's. He offered to replace the whole garage door opener with the only opener he could recommend which was a new LiftMaster with Wifi compatibility. We agreed on the work to be done and he proceeded to get the work done over the next 4 or so hours. Overall his work was well done and I'm glad to have a new good garage door opener. Would recommend him and Precision Door Service for anyone looking for a clean professional installation of a new garage door opener.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Phillip was the service man for the door. I was moving out and on that day the garage door got stuck and my car was stuck inside. I called precision door service, they made appointment over the phone right away for the same day, Phillip called me on his way and came on time. He explained what was going on and told me my options. He fixed the door in few mins and I was able to continue with my plans for the day. I recommend them. Thanks.<//text>

Brandon B. serviced our garage door and did a great job repairing it. The bearings had failed and the door was significantly out of alignment. The track was also badly bent and some of the wheels had fallen off. He managed to repair it completely and it works like new! Great service with a fair price. Thank you.<//text>

He was accommodating; provided a reasonable ETA & showed up as committed. Mike provided straight & clear information. And, an acceptable price.

Paul Brinkman was my service technician that repaired my garage door on December 20, 2019.  He came out fairly quickly and repaired the door by replacing the spring, cables and bearings.  He did a great job in a timely manner and I was very happy with his service and his professionalism.</review>

<Text>I walked out the door for an 8:30am Pilates class and, OH, NO!!, my garage door wouldn’t open!!  I called Precision Door Service and an appointment was set up for later that morning. Paul Brinkman diagnosed and gave me the cost breakdown and in a couple hours the door works better than ever. Paul is nice, efficient and easy to talk to.

Met with Mike Munoz this morning for an estimation for replacing our garage door.  He was on time, thorough, knowledgeable and open with all pricing and information.  Most of all, he's an overall pleasant person.  Highly recommend Mike to work with when figuring out the best options for replacing a garage door!< /text>

I was the last service call on Sunday for Precision Overhead Garage Door Service, James W. and his apprentice were very courteous, prompt and professional in correcting some problems caused by a previous company who did not know what they were doing. They went out of their way to help me fix an problem unrelated from the garage door. I would recommend them without hesitation.< /review>

Precision was very fast to respond to my request and the technician (Jerry) was very professional and thorough in explaining to me what needs to be fixed and what benefits I will get with the new garage opener with the best efforts and a reasonable price. I was very pleased with the work.< /Review>

<text>I strongly recommend Precision Door Service to anyone who is having problems with an existing garage door or anyone who needs a new one. Also I would like to give my highest commendation to technician Alex Kogan who did the work.
On Friday, December 13, 2019, I called Precision because the motor in my garage door opener was making some crunching noises. Precision promptly answered the phone without my having to listen to a lot of voicemail prompts. They set me up with an appointment for Monday, December 16. At the appointed time, technician Alex Kogan arrived and examined my garage door. He identified a number of problems with the door which included defective rollers, bearings, and torsion springs. Alex went right to work in repairing all of these problems and completed the job in 1.5 hours. Alex demonstrated the highest level of professionalism in the way he interacted with me, the way he identified the problems, and the way he completed the job in a timely manner. In addition, Alex had all of the necessary parts in stock on his truck. There was no need to back order anything.<//text>< user_name>

I walked out the door for an 8:30am Pilates class and, OH, NO!!, my garage door wouldn’t open!!  I called Precision Door Service and an appointment was set up for later that morning. Paul Brinkman diagnosed and gave me the cost breakdown and in a couple hours the door works better than ever. Paul is nice, efficient and easy to talk to. Thanks, Paul and Precision Door.<//review>

It was great to work with Mike. It took several weeks for us to decide on what style door we wanted to go with. Mike was patient, knowledgable and professional. He gave great advice on what style and look would go well with our home.  I highly recommend Mike Munoz and Precision for your garage door replacement. Mike ( Los Gatos )<//text>

Jerry Parker responded to my residence for adjustments on a new garage door. Jerry was very polite, and extremely knowledgeable. Not only did Jerry fix the problem, but educated me on proper lubricating the necessary parts, and answered any questions I had.
My garage door has never been quieter.
I couldn’t be happier...
Thank you Jerry !< /text>

<Text>I called Precision when my garage would not open up on my way to work the other morning. The technician Cem showed up at the beginning of the scheduled window, and called 30 minutes before he arrived to let me know he was on his way. He was extremely professional and knowledgable. He took the time to explain how my door worked and functioned, and made sure I understood as he patently answered all my questions. He did a thorough inspection and walked me though everything he found and was concerned about. I am extremely happy with my experience with Precision from the phone call to book my appointment to the end result. You can tell the employees are happy to work there, as they don't rush to finish as soon as they can like most other places these days. I will use precision door going forward, as they have earned a lifelong customer. If you are looking for a garage door repair company, I highly recommend!</Text><rating>5< /rating>< userid>

I recently worked with Mike Muñoz at a residential job my company has in San Mateo. Mike showed up on time and prepared to guide me through the quote process and assured I had a great overall experience. I would love to work more with Mike on future projects.<//Review>

<Text>What can I tell you? James showed up the same day I called and fixed my garage door (which was in pretty bad shape) and now it works perfectly. Yeah, it was expensive, but I have no way of knowing what the going rate is for these things and I'm used to spending more $$ than I would like on my house, so... James was very knowledgable and forthright. The only thing I have issue with is that the billing is not done as contractors often do... i.e. showing you the price for the parts and labor separately. This makes it harder to understand what you're actually paying for and to compare pricing. That's the only reason this doesn't get 5 stars from me.
Footnote... James came back to fix this garage door (for free - the work is under warranty) at the time he was supposed to and with minimal fuss.<//Text>< UserId.>

Had a garage door with really old springs, broken cables and was completely jammed. James did a great job in removing and replacing the old parts. His experience clearly showed in how efficiently he took care of the issue.< /text>

If you are reading this, there is no need to panic because help is a call away. Precision Door is the right company for your garage door repairs.  We were in need of a new door opener and they were able to schedule the replacement for the same day. We were lucky enough to have Alex Kogan as our technician. While I appreciate that Alex was knowledgeable about the product and install, I am very GREATFUL that he was also kind, clean, patient and an overall super nice guy. He answered all of our questions, walked us thru the in’s and out’s of our new machine and even made us laugh a few times. I could not have asked for a better experience thanks to Alex. I have added Precision Door to my phone contact list. I hope I will never have to use them again, but if I do, I know that I have a profession service company that I can trust and that hires quality techs.  THANKS ALEX YOU ARE THE BEST!!!!!!</Text>

The techincan (Sheridan) arrived within a few hours of placing the serivce request. He quickly asessed what needed to be done and provide two options for the repair (one value and one upgraded). He worked quickly and expertly to install and test the new equipment. It wasn't cheap but it was high quality parts and workmanship. It's an emergency when your garage door won't open and your car is stuck inside. You don't have time to shop around for quotes. If you value time, this company is reliable. I'd request Sheridan again.</review>

I really enjoyed the great conversation with Mike Munoz, very professional and considerate.
Although the price is not the lowest one from the offers, hopefully we will get best quality of service and product as promised by Mike.
Will follow up and update after the completion of the service...</Review>

Mike Munoz was on time, communicated very clearly, had great suggestions and listened to what I am looking for in a garage door.  I look forward to doing business with Precision Door Service because of Mike Muniz.</Text>

Used to change oil since normal place was closed due to COVID. A week later noticed drips.  Took to better service, found the attendant over tightened the plug. To fix issue, used gasket maker to gasket the plug.  Now bolt does not tighten properly.  Rookie mistake. Will not use again.< /text>

Fast, friendly and efficient are the words that come to mind. I've been a Jiffy Lube customer for many years and wouldn't go anywhere else! Victorville, CA, Santa Maria, CA, Paso Robles, CA, Las Vegas, NV, Vista, CA, and now Oxnard, CA, all have been consistently good experiences. Keep up the good work!</Text>

I was so nervous, but I was trying to keep my anxiety hidden and stay strong for my son. The whole team( the immediate team working with him was Tim, Samantha, Dr. Chris, and Dr. Jeff Cashin) helped explain thoroughly what would be going on, what to expect after and during, how to care for him, and what to look out for etc. They answered all of my questions in detail and had a lot of patience for each one( as a mother, I had quite a few). Jeff has never had an issue in his years of being an anesthesiologist( he was also voted number one at Choc Children’s hospital), but he still affirmed that he would take the precautions to make sure he was prepared for anything that could go wrong and didn’t depend just on history of a perfect record. I have experience with a lot of doctors and nurses and have never had such a peaceful and reassuring experience as I did with this team. I’m so grateful my son was in the best hands. Samantha was the sweetest. My son even told her how friendly she was. ( Don’t get me wrong, they all were the most kind, fun, and professional!). All the issues we went in with were resolved and my son is in great shape! He only remembers his friends he met there and none of the procedure. He even got to come home with a Disney princess ! Thank you to everyone at Mobi Surgery and South Orange County pediatrics. - mom ( Alana)</text><Response>{'time': 1623813723335, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your kind words, Locke.

Dr. Wu is hands down is an awesome pediatric dentist!  His staff is an amazing group of professionals who took the time to really work with our 4 year old daughter to make her feel comfortable and welcomed.  She was allowed to touch the instruments before they were put in her mouth, she picked the flavor of her treatment, she enjoyed watching the movie on the ceiling during her dental exam.  She was a little upset with the suction tool, but the staff was patient and kind, not pushy or causing stress.  She was a champ during X-RAYS and her favorite part --picking a toy-- made her appointment great.  I appreciated Dr. Wu's bedside manner and explaining in detail the findings and getting to understand our daughter's previous dental history during our discussion.  Cheers to you Dr. Wu and team!<//Text>

<user>116169167096063726877< /user><review>Dr. Wu and his staff were so compassionate and professional.
We had to be seen for an emergency dental evaluation- his staff made sure to make the appointment prompt  and answer my questions.
Dr Wu was compassionate with my son making sure he didn’t put him through extra trauma but was thorough with his examine.
He made sure all my questioned were answered and had no problems repeating or re-explaining anything that I didn’t understand.
He also followed up with me regarding my son a few days later to make sure everything was getting better.< /review><resp>{'time': 1619548022422, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your kind words, Rachel.

Highly recommend! I went here because of the positive reviews and definitely was not disappointed. The staff was so nice and the atmosphere of the office was very relaxing and calming. Dr. Wu was so patient and thoroughly explained the treatment my son needed not only to myself but to my son as well. He was extremely quick and efficient. If you’re looking for a good pediatric dentist for your child definitely come here!</review>

Dr. Wu is just the greatest children’s dentist. My child has been a patient for over 10 years. I wish he was my dentist when I was a little kid. First of all, he greets me and my child with a cheerful attitude and the kindest smile. Secondly, he communicates clearly with me about how my child’s appointment went and always has my child’s best interest in mind. And then his whole office staff is truly great to work with. I highly recommend Dr. Wu and South OC Pediatric Dentistry!</review>

Thank you for a wonderful experience.
Our daughter has always been nervous about dental visits.
Sarah was our sweet and kind hygienist.
She took great care of our daughter and her follow up care card was very appreciated.
Dr. John was also very warm and kind.
He knows how to make kids smile.
The front office staff was very welcoming.

Many heartfelt thanks,
The Armstrong Family</text>

<text>My husband and I recently brought our three sons in. Our youngest had his first check-up and it was a nice reminder of how well our two older son’s first exams went. The staff is very kind and every procedure is thorough. My middle child is shy and during our recent visit the dental hygienist worked to make him feel comfortable (never pushy) so they could conduct an exam. Our recent visit was scheduled via text and it was the easiest appointment to get all three of my kids in at once. The option for paperwork to be handled in advance was in place to make the visit even smoother. It’s clear that every touch point has been thought through. The staff guides you through every step from check-in until you leave. I’ve always left happy with the level of care my family receives  and highly recommend South OC Pediatric Denistry to anyone with children.

A big thank you to the staff!! You’re truly the best and it’s clear that you’re one big happy dental family.<//text>< pics>

<review>This office knocks pediatric dentistry out of the park. It's like a dental Home Run. Technology is up to date, procedures are dialed in, everything runs like a well oiled machine. On top of that, the staff is incredibly talented, kind, and create a safe and fun environment for children. My daughter is not an easy child; she tends to be anxious and overwhelm easily. She absolutely looks forward to visiting the office beginning with the friendly receptionists, along with the wonderful hygienist (Sarah) and not to be outdone by the fabulous Dr. Wu. It is an absolute pleasure and relief to trust them with my children's care. Looking forward to my twins' first visit next week. I'm sure they will be equally enthralled with all of the delights this office has to offer. It's like they don't even know they are getting their teeth cleaned :)</review><Rating>5<//Rating><name>Jeanette DeMeis<//name></record></dataset><record>

Both of my kids have been going to Dr DeLorme for the last 15+ years. He is the best pediatric dentist around, with the latest technology, clean office as well as bedside manner and exceptional teeth cleaning Techs.  He has a big heart in helping the community and supported both of my kids by annually donating to their volleyball careers. Great location just off the 5 freeway. Highly recommend this office above any others!< /Text>

I love this dental office.  Everyone has always been so friendly and patient with my son. We have been going to this dentist since my son was 8 months. Now at 6 years old, he still doesn’t like anyone touching or poking at him. Not the most easy patient. But the group is quick and efficient. Dr. DeLorme and staff has a great way with making the kids feel comfortable.  We appreciate that!

Thank you!</text>

< Review>
We’ve been a client of Dr. Wu’s for 7 years now and couldn’t be happier. Dr. Wu and his team are amazing.  Working with and being around children seems to come natural to them and they make my kids and myself very comfortable.  One of my favorite things they do is tell the kids everything they are going to do before they do it and even show them the tools.

The whole office is well laid out, very clean and inviting. They have a photo booth, fish tank and even video games. They also have done a good job of adjusting to the Covid requirements for visits and make us feel very safe.

My kids like going to the dentist and I’m very thankful for that and know that South OC Pediatric Dentistry is the reason why they feel comfortable and safe during office visits. Thank you!!!</Review>

<text>LOVE LOVE LOVE this dentist office!
We have been coming to this office for 6 years now, after moving from WA state.
The staff at South OC Pediatric Dentistry is so friendly  all always smiling.   My kids feel comfortable at all their Dental appointments and it’s because the amazing staff.  They work so well with children of all ages.  I have a 14 year old, 12, 6 and 2 and they love this office.

We hit the jackpot and are so lucky to have found Dr. DeLorme and his wonderful staff.  I wouldn’t want to go anywhere else because they make it feel like home.

Thank you for all you do to make my children smile.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>The doctors at South OC Pediatric Dentistry are just top notch.  They give such care to each of their patients and make the kids feel so at ease.  The office staff are always so friendly and eager to help.  Even during Covid they go out of their way to make things happen.  We recently had a semi-urgent situation and they just made everything so pleasant and got us through it.  We highly recommend this office, Dr. De Lorme, and all the doctors.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>I brought my 4 year old son in for the first time after having a not so great experience with a previous dentist. I was so pleased with South OC Pediatric Dentistry and how quickly they were able to get us in and made me feel like they genuinely cared. Both dentists at South OC Pediatric Dentistry that saw and treated my son were beyond GREAT. They made him feel so comfortable and talked to him through out the entire appointment. The ladies at the front desk were also very sweet. I do not have any complaints. Overall SO happy with our experience, we will be back 100%.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>This was an unbelievably great experience for my 2.5 yr old daughter. She LOVED every second of her appointment and even had to get an X-ray. It was her first cleaning and the staff made it amazing. She immediately asked if we can go back when we left the building. I was also very happy with how informative the dental hygienist and dentist were on child teeth care. The experience couldn’t have been more positive.< /Review>< Name>

<Text>I highly recommend South OC Pediatric Dentistry. My daughter has been patient of Dr. Wu for 5 years but has see Dr. Carillo as well. The entire team and practice is amazing. My daughter looks forward to her dental appointments. They are very knowledgeable, caring, friendly, and compassionate. The entire team cares for your child's dental health. My daughter loves watching a movie while her teeth is getting treated or cleaned. They are absolutely the best pediatric dentistry in South OC.</Text>< pics>

<text>Took our daughter here after she bruised a tooth; Dr. De Lorme was very cordial, and had a great bedside manner with our 4 year old. He gave me the full report while looking over her teeth, and gave us an idea of how to care for the bruised tooth, as well as what to watch for in the upcoming future related to the tooth. The office is spacious, clean, and up to date on their electronics and equipment (I feel like this shows that they care about their practice and continue to invest in it). Everyone was very professional and a pleasure to communicate with, so I've happily rounded up my twins for their first dental appointments in the near future.  Did I mention that they have a super cool salt water tank in their lobby? Every child can exclaim "it's Nemo!!!" while you see the excellent care taken on this show piece.

For the Covid restrictions, they were all-stars in keeping up with protocol,  and keeping space between patients in both the lobby and cleaning areas. I could see that they had sanitizing items ready for after patient visits, and everything was spotless.
I also appreciate how they're up to date on getting you your new patient paperwork.  I was able to fill it out at home electronically and send it back before our first visit; no wasting 15-20 minutes coming in early for that.  I'm super impressed with them, and they have now set the bar for what I look for in a pediatric dentist.<//text>< Gmap_id>

We then took our 3yo in for his very first visit and he interacted wonderfully with him. We are actually in the process of moving to CO and Dr. Wu gave us awesome recommendations out there for some peace of mind.

Awesome experience Everytime!  My kids do the dentist like a champ because of this place!  When I was a kid I hated the dentist.  They even have cool toys kids actually want!  They explain everything to us parents, include us in the x-rays, talk to us about new incoming teeth, and potential for teeth straightening.   Everything is streamlined as well.  This is not a waste of the day, it is about as in and out as it can be.  Pleased and impressed every time!< /review>

I took my 2 1/2 year old daughter for her first dentist appointment today. South OC Pediatric is in the same building as my chiropractor and their office seemed nice and clean plus my chiropractor mentioned he was happy with the way they answered his questions so I gave them a try today and it was a great experience. My daughter felt at ease and the dentist was awesome. I had a good feeling about the place and I was right. Thank you for your great service and care today.</Review>

<review>Our daughters have been going to South OC Pediatric Dentistry for the last few years, since infancy. The doctors and staff here are all amazing! They made everything so comfortable for us to visit, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. From a screening questionnaire, to taking your temperature at the door, providing sanitized pens to complete forms with, the entire visit was, as always, wonderful! Dr. Wu and Dr. Carrillo are both amazing with kids and really make them feel comfortable. I'd give ten stars if I could!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>My kids (ages 3 & 4) have been going to see Dr Carillo since they were each 1 year old. They are very weary of doctors in general so it has taken some time for them to open up. This past visit, was the first time that neither cried, and better yet-- my youngest allowed them to clean her teeth thoroughly. We are very pleased with the progress and the excellent care the entire team offers during every visit. I highly recommend them for all your pediatric dental needs!!!<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlamdMZJi3p53sRcfuDbVofCDAhX1E5FcTgl_5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

Update: another great visit. I have one easy kiddo and one who needs a lot of patience during dentist visits. The whole team were receptive to listening to my son and adjusting as needed to get the job done but not stress him out since he was not liking it. I very much appreciate all of the time spent with my kids and explaining everything to me!

Had a great appointment at South OC Pediatric Dentistry today! Everything from booking the appointment over text (thank you!) to all of the COVID precautions- this place is great. They booked my 3yo and 5yo's appointments at the same time so there was no waiting for one to finish. Both hygienists  and dentist were patient, kind, and attuned to my kids' reactions to the appointment- making adjustments the whole time to ensure a positive experience for everyone. You guys are the best!<//text>

<review>I was recommended to see Dr. John by another dentist when I asked for the best place to go near where I live. This office is very kid friendly which is important at a pediatric office. They were on time which I appreciate. The decor was very nice, clean modern and fun. Every staff member I encountered was so nice and offered my daughter so many things to keep her entertained during the visit. Dr. John must have a presence kids love because my 14 month old let him do an entire exam without crying. I'll definitely be back.< /review>< Gmap_id>

I enjoyed the promptness of sending the new patient paperwork to home to save time with my little ones prior to going into the office. The receptionist welcomed us with a genuine warm smile and also as we left. The lobby area was clean and tidy. My 2-year old son felt comfortable in the office even though he’s typically more shy and hesitant in new places. Sarah was also patient and attentive with him while showing him and explaining the different tools she was using. I enjoyed interacting with her as well. The doctor was also great with my son. I appreciated how quick and efficient they were especially with having 2 of my kids with me. The handwritten thank you card after our visit is definitely above and beyond. Will definitely keep coming here and will bring my daughter as her teeth start coming in. Thank you for a great experience!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

My kids love going to the dentist... Do I need to say more? The entire staff is friendly and genuinely cares about making dental care fun for the kids. Pre-covid they had a ton of fun toys in the waiting room and a picture booth, but that's all been put away in the interest of keeping a clean environment...
They're upholding top notch screening now to ensure that everyone stays safe during your visit, and make sure that every surface is disinfected after use. They are even have movies playing above the chairs to help keep kids happy when they need to sit still. If you're looking for a great dentist who sincerely cares about your kids, you really can't do better than South OC Pediatric Dentistry.< /Text>

I needed a new dentist and was happy to find my son’s pediatric dentist was now doing Adult dentistry. Made an apt and COVID hit but waited and finally went today. All precautions were made to make sure you are safe. Such a warm reception and the hygienist was super friendly. Dr Jane explained all her findings and I was impressed that she gives advice and didn’t push procedures on you. Dr Jane is very easy to talk to and if you’re looking for a new dentist, she’s it! Glad to see that all the wonderful reasons we went to Dr Delorme can happen for us big kids too!!< /Review>

I have been taking my daughters to see Dr. Woo for the past 4 years. Everyone there is professional and truly lovely. My 5 year old and I love her dental hygienist, Ms. Brie. She is very kind and engaging. But truly, everyone there is amazing. I wish all dentist experiences were this way. I am truly so thankful for them because they make the trip to the dentist fun!<//review>

Highly recommend.... they were wonderful with our 2 year old for her first dentist appointment. We thought it would be meltdown central and a struggle but it went so well and she isn’t afraid to go back.<//Text>

Both dentists in this office are FANTASTIC.  I don't even request one or the other because they are both so good.  The front office staff is also extremely friendly, professional and knowledgeable.  My children have also been over to the orthodonture office affiliated with this one and Dr. Carter is also amazing!  My daughter went through 2 sets of braces of with him and so far he keeps saying my son doesn't need them.  Honesty!  I cannot recommend South OC Pediatric Dentistry and Orthodontics highly enough.</Text>< pictures>

They are AMAZING! My 4 kids have been going here for years! Never one bad experience. They treat your kids as if they were theirs. Couldn’t recommend them more highly! They’ve always taken the kids in on time. They always ask before they do anything (X-ray, fluoride, etc). They work with you for payments. I can’t imagine there is anything they can do better!!</text>

<text>We love South OC Pediatric Dentistry.  The entire staff is friendly and so helpful. Dr. DeLorme is amazing. He is very knowledgeable, conservative with treatment and makes all of my children feel very safe and comfortable going to the dentist.  Our dental insurance changed and South OC is now out of network. But we love the office so much we are continuing to stay. The office staff has been extremely helpful going out of their way to read through our insurance plan, call the insurance company directly and then followed up with me to help explain in detail our benefits. I highly recommend South OC Pediatric Dentistry<//text><Name>Krista McAdam< /Name>< user>

Great experience!  I got a last minute appointment about a week after I called.  Dr. DeLorme and his staff have always been accommodating and professional.  They were great with the COVID 19 precautions, had our own isolated exam room, 6 feet of distancing, temperature check with alcohol gels everywhere.  I’ve been taking my son to Dr. DeLorme for 8 years and have always been happy with him.<//text>

This place is amazing. I switched here from another dentist and it has made all the difference. My kids feel at ease here because the staff and Dr Sam Wu are very kid friendly and welcoming.

<Text>My now 4 year old LOVES going to the dentist, thanks to the South OC Pediatric team! After a bad experience at another dentist, my son was afraid to go to the dentist. Now he gets excited to go. From the warm and friendly front desk staff, to the gentle, attentive hygienists to the dentist himself, everyone is great and takes the time and care to explain everything they are doing so both my toddler and I feel comfortable.

< review>
I truly have no words. I have experienced a few pediatric dental offices and there is NONE that compare. Dr. John and his staff have a special way with children, and the experience for them is calm, easy and let’s just say they spoil them.m (toy wall, photo booth with props, fish tank, books and cool video games)

I have a daughter, age 5, had 8 cavities in her molars. I was told I would have to admit her to Chalk Hospital for surgery under anesthesia. My dentist gave me Dr. John’s name and said go to him for a second opinion. He performed 4 visits under bubblegum smell laughing gas and filled all 8 for his in office.
Al
He is kind compassionate and loves children. Moon was his assistant all 4 times she talked to her and made her so comfortable, she too has a way with children.

We returned for a cleaning and follow up today, and to be honest my daughter was a bit nervous knowing, but again left with nothing but smiles on her face. As for my 4 year old, she asked if we could go again tomorrow...

To make you understand how great this practice is, we had to commute 30-40 min. And it is absolutely worth it.

Everyone is professional, especially the checkout when you pay. They helped squeeze and spread the insurance for me, strategizing how to maximize my benefits.

Thank you OC Pediatric Dentistry... I am so happy we found you<//review>

My girls think going to see the dentist is like going to an indoor play gym! They love it! Dr. Wu and his staff are amazing. They do a really good job of explaining to their patients (in my case, a 5YO and a 2YO) what they’re doing so they are at ease. I wish I had the same experience as an adult with my dentist. Parking is easy, the facility is clean, best of all, they have a ton of goodies to reward the girls after their exams. I’d recommend them without reservation.</review>

< Review>
Outstanding care from the moment we walked through the door until the moment we left.  Kind, attentive, energetic and engaged.  Dr. Sam is TERRIFIC and took plenty of time, and asked a lot of questions to help build my son's treatment plan and care with me,.  He is knowledgeable and very likeable.

I cannot say enough good about the front desk team.  As kids were exiting the care area and parents were going to set up follow up appointments, the first question asked of each parent is "where does your child go to school?"  They then pulled up that school's calendar and schedule to help the parents with setting up appointments around their cihld's school.  It's a HUGELY thoughtful and considerate step to take to help out busy parents, and it made an enormous impression on me.

If you are looking for a dentist practice for your children, look no further.  They are the real deal and incredibly wonderful.<//Review>

Friendly office that is very patient with my young children.  My daughter also had a stain between her front teeth and they were able to quickly remove the stain without any discomfort.  My daughter actually enjoys going to the dentist because of how gentle and friendly they are.  So glad we found this office.</Review>

South OC is just incredible, from reception to check-out, this office goes above & beyond. My kids have been patients here for 3 years now (ages 8 & 11) & they’ve always felt so comfortable. They’ve had cleanings, x-rays, cavities filled, & one tooth wiggled out, all with the most gentle care. My kids have been seen by Dr DeLorme, Dr Wu & Dr Carillo & they can’t pick a favorite, they are all so good! The staff treats my kids like their own, they are all so sweet. My kids are always excited for their appointments & they ask to get there early so they can see the fish tank, take a photo in the photo-booth & play video games. I’m so thankful for this office & the positive experience they are giving my kids.< /Review>

This review is for the new adult practice (not pediatric), and for Dr Jane Cho and staff (hygienist, admins, & dental assistant.) Facilities are brand new, spotlessly kept, and equipped with the latest equipment available.

Dr Jane Cho is a true professional who provided my wife and I with the most thorough checkups and oral care advice we've ever had. She is personable, caring, delightful, well-educated and truly talented!

Our hygienist, Natalie, was most gentle yet thorough, and also a delight. Nick (dental assistant) and Katie (and I believe Laurie) were all friendly and attentive to details throughout our visits.

Best dental care, ever!< /Text>

I have been a more than satisfied client for over 15 years and wouldn't go anywhere else. There are smiles, kindness,   the personal touch right alongside stellar work and professionalism.

<review>Such a friendly and well organized practice. Unbelievably great with the kids! They have a huge fish tank with “Nemo” and “Dory” right when you walk into the lobby. My daughter loves it! Big smiles and friendly staff greet you. Stickers for the kids at check in and a photo booth. Once your child is brought back they have movies playing and stuffed animals with teeth so your little one can practice brushing. The dentists are just so great and thorough as are the hygienists.
Your child gets to choose a small toy at the end of the visit. I highly recommend this place! A+++</review><Response>None</Response><username>Carrie Lechtenberger< /username>< Time>

I can not speak more highly about South OC Pediatric Dentistry. Our daughter had high anxiety going to the dentist but they made it a good experience on her every visit. They are always so very helpful and understanding with me, as the Mom of the daughter with high anxiety... I can’t thank them enough. Highly recommend Dr. DeLorme and Moon (hygienist).</Review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Text>I highly recommend South OC Pediatric Dentistry! My 11 month old was supposed to see Dr. De Lorme for his first dental appointment when the stay-at-home orders went into effect (we’ve been patients since my oldest’s (3 year old) first dental visit). Lynne walked me through changing to a virtual appointment, including calling my insurance provider in advance to let me know the coverage details. The virtual appointment was easy to set-up and I was able to jump on a face-time call with Dr. De Lorme (I am not tech-savvy by nature - and the process was easy! Lynne was also standing by to ensure a smooth connection), Dr. De Lorme was even able to pull up charts to share on the screen and I was able to text photos to be added to my little one’s chart! It was re-assuring to ask several questions I had and discuss dental care for my child. As always, Dr. De Lorme was knowledgeable, kind, and patient (understanding a wiggly/distracted little guy!). I’m so grateful for the wonderful care my children receive from Dr. De Lorme (and his team!) and that even in this interesting time we can keep regular visits moving forward. Whether in-person or virtual we receive the same first class experience and are glad our children are patients of South OC Pediatric Dentistry!<//Text></record>

Office is VERY kid friendly and clean! My three kids ages 3 5 & 7 look forward to every cleaning. Dr. John told my daughter I bet by your next visit that tooth will be gone. Ha, he was right!
My middle guy did have a cavity to be filled. All I’m going to say is..I wish I had a dentist as good as Dr De Lorme when I was a kid! My son didn’t even realize he was given a Novocain shot! I hate to admit it, my son will cry over anything. I was amazed!

Well, it so happens that the filling snags when flossing. At my sons exam yesterday Dr De Lorme mentioned it to me and apologized that the cavity wasn’t smoother and offered to correct it at no cost before I could say it was a concern of mine. He was even more so knowing he’d have to numb my son again a little. I’m confident we will have another amazing experience. He’s an honest dentist with a great staff!< /Text>

The staff are friendly and professional. We have entrusted our daughter’s dental health to Dr De lorme for years. He has always taken the time to describe potential issues and methods to avoid them. He’s thorough in his process and we appreciate his kindness when dealing with my daughter.<//Text>

If you have a kiddo who has trouble with docs, you can understand my gratitude for Dr Wu and the caring technicians at South OC Pediatric Dentistry. They are always awesome and patient, doing everything they can to make my anxious child comfortable and I never feel like I have to apologize. Seriously, the dentist can be SO challenging and I am so grateful for this team!<//Text>

Cannot recommend Dr. Delorme enough! He is the best, most gentle and honest dentist you’ll ever take your child to. We had come from another dental office where my daughter had a terrible experience,  and his entire office made her feel so comfortable, so unafraid, that now she actually looks forward to and enjoys going to the dentist!! I didn’t think that would ever be possible. He is conservative in his treatment approach, which is so appreciated. Not all dentists are. The office staff is fabulous from reception to the hygienists. Truly cannot say enough great things about Dr. Delorme and  his office. Highly recommend!<//Review>

The best pediatric dentists office around.  My son thought he chipped his tooth and I immediately called the office and they gave me a same day appointment.  Dr. De Lorme was great and in just a few minutes we were all fixed up....No fuss no muss!  Best customer service in the field!  Wish all medical practices were this amazing.</Text>

This is our second visit for my 2 yr old.  After the first visit, she was very enthusiastic about brushing her own teeth and regularly does it (and well) by herself.  They are extremely friendly, professional, and knowledgeable.  I have not seen one dental technician / dentist fail to give the necessary time and attention to make the children feel comfortable about having a "stranger" stick fingers, brushes, mirrors, suction tubes, etc in their mouths.

Nothing but full praise and we look forward to coming back in 6 months for our next check-up.<//Text>

When my son first started going to this dentist, he was terrified. Dentist Chris Carillo was amazing with him. He's been 3 times now and this last time he was super brave, sat in the big chair, and even handled getting X-rays really well.  My youngest is now going too and his experience was very positive. I wish the hygienists were as friendly. Both that we worked with were visibly annoyed at our no-fluoride requests (the kids are 3 and under!), and one had an abrupt reaction to discovering that my 24m old still breastfeeds occasionally.  It was a little disappointing. Good thing the dentist was impressed by the health of the boys' teeth! No cavities or concerns!<//Review>

My kids have been going to Dr Delorme for their whole childhood. They have had the best dental care and I love the office staff. They are now 18 and 21 and I can’t think of taking them anywhere else.<//review>

Both of my daughters love going to the dentist now that they got here.  Truly the best dental experience I have ever had.  I wish I could go here myself!  They are always  positive, and make the entire experience fun from the photo booth, to the prizes at the end of each visit.  Dr. Wu is amazing and one of the kindest people I have ever met.</Text>

< Review>
I have been taking my boys here for the past 11 years now.  I love this place.  Dr. Lovinger is great.  Always lets you know what is going on, and is trustworthy.  There were many instances when other dentists would have pushed for this and that.  But he has always been conservative and reliable.  My boys love coming here, and so do I.  The staff is great!  Customer service here is exemplary.  I have no complaints.  A+++  When my sons are too old to come here, it will be hard to find another place to match them.  And the aquarium... so relaxing to watch.  Just love everything about this practice.  It is how a dentistry practice should be!</Review>

Dr. Wu is the best.  He knows how to work with a child that is apprehensive about dental procedures and takes the time to explain his findings and observations to the parents.  He always gives great advice and treats the children with respect.  The office is not "around the corner" from us, but going there is worth the trip.

As a bonus, the support staff are also top notch.  No medical staff attitude here!</review>

We have been taking our 2 kids to S. OC Pediatric Dentistry for 2 years, since our son was 1 and our daughter was 3. We can’t think of one negative thing to say about the group... everything from the office decor and beautiful aquarium, to the friendly receptionist, to the back office staff who are so great at engaging with young kids and helping them feel comfortable, to the entertainment provided for the kids while their teeth are being worked on, to the kind, knowledgeable & informative dentist that Dr. John DeLorme is, to the awesome assortment of prize options, stickers, tattoos, games, and a photo booth that make the experience so fun for kids, they don’t even realize they’re at the dentist! I read an article today about how 3 year olds often dislike going to the dentist because they associate the white coats that the dentists wear with the ones that their pediatricians wear when they go to the doctor and get painful shots... that was surprising to me because my 3 year old son had his check up earlier this week and absolutely loved the whole experience! So South OC Pediatric Dentistry has mastered the art of defying the odds and making going to the dentist an enjoyable experience for young children!< /review>

We have been with Dr. DeLorme since my girls were 3 years old.  They are now in high school and my oldest is graduating from a pediatric dentist.  We were both sad at leaving his office. They love this dentist and so do I.  He is very personal and his staff is wonderful.  I would highly recommend this office.</Review>

South OC Pediatric Dentistry & Orthodontics cannot be any better.  From initial phone contact to out the door with bag of dental goodies and always a smile on my 4 year old's face, the experience for both of us is surely five stars.  Every professional in this office is comforting and knowledgeable; we are always warmly welcomed, every hygienist has been great with my daughter, and Dr. Wu is quite involved and quick to offer praise and encouragement.  He even took the time to pick out a toy with my daughter during her last visit.  We have had numerous visits to this practice and they have all been very impressive. My daughter has been very serious about her dental hygiene and she loves going to the dentist!  Thank you, SOCPD for being a part of a strong foundation for my daughter's dental health.< /text>

<rate>5<//rate><text>All 3 of my daughters go to South OC, we have been going there for 17 years.  My oldest daughter (19), even though an adult, refuses to switch to another dental office and says she will continue to go there until she gets kicked out because she is too old!
They all love it there.
Funniest thing is that my daughter said she didn't want to go to another dentist because she heard other dentists give shots and Dr. Delorme doesn’t.  I told her “Of course they do, how else would you get your fillings done and you felt numb after right?”.  She said “That was a shot?”.
You can’t find a better place!   Where your kids love going there and don’t even know when they get shots!  I might switch from my regular dentist!
A very grateful mom :)< /text>< Pics>

South OC Orthodontics is a great place for anyone. The staff is extremely kind and very clean offices. This is 2018 now, as I'm writing, so some of the doctors & dentists people recommended on various reviews are retired. Plus, I'm very proud I earned my Local Guide Badge recently! If you have not heard of me, I am a local guide in the Orange County area. Overall, South OC is a great place in the Orthodontics building. There are additional building associated with the organization, so I'm talking about the Orthodontics building. They also have guest Wi-Fi at some of the buildings. Thank you OC Ortho!< /Text>

< Review>
Prior to going to Dr. Delorme my boys had gone to another dentist and I was not happy with how the hygienist or dentist really worked on helping the kids understand how to brush and floss. Dr. Delorme and his staff really do a good job with this and though my boys are not perfect in this area they are seeing more of the importance. It's always great to have the reinforcement at your dentist office. Dr. Delorme is a super dentist and I can always trust his honest feedback on orthodontic work recommended too. The staff is helpful and great too! The boys really like him and they are now 17 and 14!!</Review>

Dr. John was our angel dentist when we first brought in our son Romeo, at 4 years old, still recovering from trauma from his first "pediatric" dentist.  Dr. John and his staff immediately took care of our son and wiped out any trace of fear and anxiety from him on that very first visit!  Romeo is now 16 and his sister, Ysabella, 14 and I dread the day that they could no longer come to this office for their dental needs!   It is just one less thing to worry about with all the stress of parenting these days!    Thank you from the bottom of my heart of hearts!</text>

Local Bay Area taco truck with bomb birria tacos! Lots of street parking and the key is to order ahead of time online so you don’t have to wait too long. They have 3 tables set up in front of their truck where you can sit and eat.< /review>

I bought a delicious torta to go for the first time, when I open my box I saw that it was a very small and thin sandwich for $14 delicious but not worth $14.
Very small  sandwich and it does not come with anything very disappointed with portion< /Text>

We tried the birria torta and the red tacos (birria tacos). Service was prompt, and the food was very filling. Definitely split a side of consomme between multiple people- it's huge! Overall, we had a flavorful and pleasant experience that was well worth the money.< /review>

I LOOOOOOVE this place. Birria is one of the foods I always look forward to during the holidays. Anytime I can eat it, I will. How I never imagined putting it in a taco is beyond me. The birria here is tender, juicy, and spot-on saucy. On top of that, the gooey cheese melted on top makes it an irresistible and unctuous combination. Three tacos is quite a large portion. Split it, add a side of elotes, and call it a perfect lunch.< /Text>

<Review>These are amazing beef birria w/cheese tacos. Flavorful and savory especially if you request consommé for dipping (and extra cost). The taco shells hold up great for such juicy filling. They can be found at Broadway/4th in Jack London Square in Oakland.</Review><gmapID>0x808f81d9f6bcb03f:0x4e1665e89017c9ae< /gmapID><Time>1608523360146<//Time>< user_id>

The churros were excellent. Had a nice caramel cream inside. Large portions so it's best to share.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMC0DcOtpoJg8yvXzrIp_kCh0hQ3G9S98KIFHcb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

<Review>The bomb birria in the Bay. Deeply flavorful in the taco (always get it with the broth) and just as delicious in a torta.  Fast service and nice sized portions makes this an Oakland must visit.</Review><GmapID>0x808f81d9f6bcb03f:0x4e1665e89017c9ae< /GmapID><rate>4< /rate><user_id>106675834233553168523</user_id><username>Oscar Bermeo< /username>< date>

<text>Out of 9 birria places I've been to between San Diego and the bay area this one is by far the best. The tortilla doesn't get soggy like most places and they put a good amount of cheese in it.  The corn with hot cheetos is sooooooo good.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

A classic torta with flavorful meat and substantial bread for dipping.  $12 is an average food truck price.<//Review>

I really like the team at Clovis Family Dentistry, they are all nice and super friendly. They understand that most people are afraid of the dentist office and they do a fantastic job of making you feel comfortable and relaxed. If you don't have dental insurance they offer a great in-house plan that is very reasonable. If you are looking for a Dentist definitely check out Clovis Family Dentistry and tell them I sent you ;-)<//review>< Time>

Friendly and easy to work with. Great attitudes and transparent when it comes to cost and insurance processes. A text reminder is send for appointments and they like to follow up as well. Great choice for anyone looking for a long-term dentist or for some simple in and out work.<//review>

<Review>Extremely professional and friendly.  Very punctual, if the appointment is at 4 pm, that means you will see the doctor at 4 pm. For a person that was always dreading to go see a dentist, I am now a fan. I actually look forward to doing my regular check ups, the fear is finally gone :)<//Review>< rate>

They got me in for my first visit as an emergency right away & took great care of me.  Dr Lander & his team just did a filling on one of my teeth in less than 30 minutes total time in & out (from the time I left my vehicle until I was back in my vehicle)- I didn't know that was possible.  It was a big cavity.  I'm impressed.  I signed up my whole family for care there & we're all happy with the treatment we receive there.

The staff is extremely welcoming and made this by far the best trip to the dentist I have ever had. The receptionist handled my insurance efficiently and it was so easy to schedule my appointment. The dental hygienist was thorough and even taught me a better technique for flossing with my water pic. Dr. Lander is knowledgeable, professional, and his friendliness put me at ease instantly. I highly recommend Clovis Family Dentistry and am so glad that I made the choice to switch my family over to this practice.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>My children and I have been coming to Clovis Family Dentistry for over 12 years now. On several occasions I needed emergency treatment and they have always worked me into their schedules. Both Dr. Lander and his assistant Lino have always been very courteous and professional. They always explain what they are doing and go over my treatment plan.

I went in today with a chipped front tooth and cracked crown. In about 2 1/2 hours I got the chipped tooth repaired and a whole new crown. I highly recommend Clovis Family Denistry.< /review>< resp>

<review>By far this is the best dentist I have ever been to. They treat you with great respect, do a fantastic job every time on my teeth, always make sure your comfortable, and have the most friendly staff! I have been to many dentists because I have been wanting to get my missing tooth filled in and no one else had ever mentioned to me the cheaper more affordable option of getting a bridge done instead of an implant (and implants are double the price and more time to get done). But on the first day at this dentist they informed me about what a bridge was and how they could do for me in a day. I have now got my bridge done and it looks beyond my expectations! Great work for a great price. I can now smile with confidence! Thank you Clovis Family Dentistry (:<//review>< Pics>

I love this place. The staff is very friendly and helpful. On the first visit they gave me a gift bag, introduced everyone, and gave me a tour of everything.They schedule you quickly and they’re open fairly late. The Dentist is very nice as well. Everything is done in-house. Couldn’t be happier with the choice to go here.< /Review>

The Dr is extremely rude. I’ve had to go back 3 times for ONE filling to be done. The last time I waited over an hour in the chair for him to get started because he kept running around to other rooms. The staff is friendly, but the Dr is so rude I will not be going back.< /Text>

<Review>The dentist scolded one of the dental assistances, in front of me, saying that “She spends too much time getting her nails done rather than knowing her job.” It was extremely sexist and after he yelled at her he continued to work on my teeth pretty violently and there wasn’t nearly enough numbing medicine. When I told them it hurt they didn’t do anything. It was a horrible experience and I really hope that doesn’t happen to anyone else. The receptionist, Daisy I believe, is really rude too. Honestly they need to work on costumer service or hospitality. I will never be going there again.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Its all ok when this guy takes the time to talk about himself and his accomplishments but please take pen and paper for notes, cuz he doesnt take time for written estimates.

It was the worst dental experience ive ever had, the bedside manner by the dentist was terrible, and he kept complaining.  They did not numb me up nearly enough for the work being done.  I felt almost every thing that was happening at times almost coming up out of the chair. When i felt pain, they would do nothing for it, and would tell me, ohh just a little more hang on.  Half way through, the dentist took a 30 min break, and went right back into it without numbing me up again.  To top it off, the other younger dentist that worked their was flirting with my fiance!  Very disrespectful,  and un professional people work here.  And they will not work with your insurance, i had to pay 90%.  Trust me, its not my insurance cause i just had another one done a few days ago, and my insurance covered 70% with same insurance! I wouldnt recommend my worst enemy to this place!</Review>< Pics>

<Review>This whole office is top notch! Dr. Lander and Melissa are a very good team. Both take the time to explain all the details and reasoning for what needs to be done, but whats more important is they make you feel real comfortable and are very gentle with the work they do. Daisy and staff are very polite and helpful with any questions that need answers. A+ service across the board!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

What a nightmare! Dentist had 4 patients going at once, running back and forth to each, saying "I'm way behind." The first three shots of Novocaine started to wear off by the time he got back to me and he shot me with 4 more, one right after the other, that caused my jaw muscle to freeze up so he could barely get into my mouth to cement the new bridge. (which is as smooth as sand paper)

I returned two weeks later because my jaw had developed TMJ due to the injections. I could barely open it to take a bite. He acted confused and surprised. He said it would go away in time. He gave me amoxicillin and told me to take 800 mg of ibuprofen 3 times a day. The he charged me over $200 for  the visit due to his incompetence. After 4 weeks I had to go to my general practitioner to get proper treatment that involved steroids and physical therapy.</text>

The dentist and his staff are very inviting and kind. They care about the health of my teeth. And they are always willing to take the time to help me understand the procedures. The office staff is always very busy but they always want to make me a coffee. Always wanting to make me feel welcomed.  I’ve had regular cleaning, deep pocket cleaning, molded for night guard, and even had cap put  in place the very same day. I am very pleased to have them as my dentist.</review><rating>5</rating><pics>None< /pics></record>

<Review>What a great experience!
I’m from Germany and it was my first time being in CA.
Got really excited but then the worst case scenario happened:
A sudden pain in my front teeth. Didn’t know what to do. Never been before in Fresno. So I managed to survive the night.
The next day: Checking Google for some Dentist…et voilà, it suggested me Dr. Lander. What a luck!

I got an emergency appointment, cause I was still suffering. Went to him, it was possible to get there at the same day, and met a lovely staff! They were so kind and they took really good care of me. Dr. Lander checked my teeth…and yes I needed a new crown. He managed to replace it within the same day. This was outstanding. Did not even know that something like that could be possible. I was so sure that I had to spent nearly my whole vacation for this „tooth-gate“. This dentist is an exceptional professional. He worked very fast and very precise. He’s using some 3D-Laser for measuring your mouth and teeth, so he’s able to reproduce the crown right on the spot! Never seen something like that before. Perfect fit!

This staff is so professional. Big thanks also to Kate Lander, she explained every next step and took the anxiety from me.
Dr. Lander and his team were very caring and created a well-being atmosphere. If Fresno wouldn’t be so far away from Cologne: He would be my dentist!  —> Definitely high recommendation. A+< /Review>< pics>

Yesterday I had two crowns put on my front teeth that had been chipped and cracked for the last 12 years. I was very nervous about the experience but the entire staff and the doctor were so gracious. They were attentive, calming and efficient. They went above and beyond to make sure the process was painless and comfortable. And the finished result is wonderful! The technology they have in office makes it possible to complete the process same day! I went in with chipped teeth and left that same day with beautiful new teeth without dealing with temporary teeth for weeks. And they're beautiful! I would highly recommend coming here for any dental needs. My children have come here for all their cleanings and they love it too. They're always kind and put the kids at ease. Very professional and personal at the same time.<//review>

<Text>Fast and courteous service. Just finished my fifth visit. Very consistent. A big advantage not having to come back a second time waiting for a crown to be built somewhere else. Same day crowns. Very durable service. I haven't had to go back for repairs. Not too pricey with discounts. I would refer them to friends.</Text><Rate>5</Rate></record>

I have been going to Clovis Family Dentistry for several years and have now had 4 or 5 crowns and multiple fillings.  I highly recommend them for the following reasons.  Dr. Lander has an excellent chair side manner and technique.  He provides a clear explanation of the issues I'm facing with my teeth at age 71.  I had two crowns put on the same day this past week.  The process was truly painless.  Start to finish was less than 2 hours and the results have been excellent.  The staff provides excellent service and gets insurance approvals quickly.  Clovis Family Dentistry is on the leading edge with the use of technology.< /review>

Dr Lander and his team have crafted a delightful unique patient centric environment for dental patients with fascinating modern technologies employed throughout the offices. Each associate I made contact with was remarkably friendly and  informative. Dr Lander is obviously a team leader by example as my experience with Dr Lander was nothing less than first class.
I was referred by my wife because she enjoyed a similar experience and scheduled my appointment.
Thank you Dr Lander and team.< /Text></record>

Best dentist .............. ever.  I have had a few different dentists over time but Clovis Family Dentistry is the best ever.  I even told them they were the best dentist I have ever had with the exception of when I was a kid. As a kid I always got a sucker or some sort of toy.  They then told me I go to the treasure chest if I wanted. They are awesome.</review>

I've been using Clovis Family Dentistry since they were a new business.  From the first visit, Dr. Lander has been more than a great dentist, he treats you like a friend.  He always makes an effort to say hello even on the busiest days.  The staff are very nice and skilled at what they do.  I really have had very minimal wait times and they are quite prompt at getting you to a room to initiate a procedure.  My wife and some of my co-workers all enjoy the service that they have also received from Dr. Lander. If you are looking for a skilled dentist with excellent people skills as a bonus and a support staff that will treat you well, this is the dentist for you.

Thanks Dr. Lander for you great service, friendly conversations, and to your excellent support staff.

It seems to me as if they welcome any challenge, and are eager to prove to their patients how important they are to the people in the office.

Great experience at Clovis Family Dentistry.  Came from Texas and I was looking for a new dentist.  My wife recommended Clovis Family Dentistry.  Went for my first visit and was greeted by a warm and friendly staff.  My dentist was fantastic.  Took the time to explain procedures and was very friendly.  I would highly recommend this dental office to any of my friends.< /Text>

Dr. Lander is the best dentist I have ever had in my life.
The atmosphere has consistently been relaxing and safe and that’s huge for a dentist office!
Kate, Doctors Wife is always kind and helpful with any questions we have.
Melissa is the best hygienist and once again, to find a dental office where we are reluctant to go to our appointments is huge!
Jasmine is so friendly and I look forward  to seeing her each time I am in. Kayla is at the front desk and is so professional while being so welcoming at the same time.
I met a new assistant, Roberto, who is incredibly polite and I knew I was in good hands because of his mannerism.
All of the staff are highly competent and are a tremendous asset to Doctor Landers practice.
Thank you so much for taking care of our families dental needs for the last 6 years.
We look forward to many more years with you all.

Sincerely,
Tracy Ann Simpson

My last dentist moved to Colorado, I rolled the dice and decided to give Dr. Ray Lander & the team at Clovis Family Dentistry a try. Dr. Lander confirmed that my 20 yr old crown needed to be replaced and showed me the x-rays & photos to prove it. I thought this would be a long & painful procedure. I went to my appointment and the office staff had my insurance coverage worked out. No headaches there, I was given an estimate previously and knew what my co-pay would be up front...So far so good. Dr. Lander has a steady hand and my procedure was smooth and pain-free. The big plus is that they made the crown in the office and put it in the same day. Thankfully, the whole office has all of the latest technology!

<review>Incredibly pleased with how the experience went. And this review is coming from someone with a debilitating Anxiety Disorder. I knew my teeth were bad but I want to start fixing that. But my anxiety and funds have made it difficult to act on that desire.

Dr. Lander and his associates made me feel safe and not judged for the quality of my teeth. They went over what looked good, what needed work, and what I can do to help myself at home. They put many of my concerns to rest; no easy feat for a person who worries about everything.

If you aren't insured, talk to them about their in-house dental coverage, it may work for you. That's the option I took since my part-time work does not provide dental insurance. For me, it took the sting out of the cost a bit.

If you're overall just looking for a friendly, safe feeling dentist, then I say give them a try for sure. I have no concerns about going back for further treatment and cleaning.</review><Resp>None< /Resp><name>Bear Williams</name><userid>108418342409572716494<//userid><Rating>5<//Rating><Pics>None< /Pics>< time>

This place was just awful for the three year I went there. The staff and the dentist were incredibly rude. The nurses weren’t gentle at all. I have a very sensitive gag reflex, and even after telling them about it, when they were taking my X-rays they just jammed the thing in my mouth. I nearly threw up several times.

My mom needed a night guard because she grinds her teeth. The first one she had done didn’t quite fit right and her her jaw to wear at night, so she called to have another one made. The dentist was very rude to her, saying he sends his molds to “only the best” and that it’s “impossible for them to not work”. Mom made an appointment to have molds taken again, and he was very rude to her while she was in there.

I haven’t been to my orthodontist for years, so when my permanent retainer started coming off one of my teeth, we called to see if they could glue it back down. They said yes, and so a few days later I went in. I was in there for two hours without having it taken care of. In those two hours, five nurses came in and asked why I was there. I was getting up to leave, tired of waiting, when a nurse got the dentist. It didn’t even take them two minutes to get my retainer taken care of.

We finally switched dentists, after pestering my mom to do so after two years. These people were terrible, and caused a lot of pain and anxiety on my part. I’ve always been scared of the dentist, and these people did NOT help that at all. We go the the Grant’s now, and in the half hour I was there, I wasn’t freaked out ONCE<//Text>< Pics>

<text>If I could give this place (0) stars I would! The most unpleasant dental experience I have ever had. I had an appointment at 3:00pm I arrived 20 minutes early because as we all know there is paperwork that needs to be filled out if its your first visit, so needless to say I was prepared for nothing because the office was closed for lunch and would return at 3:00pm?! Like, what company does this? Yes every one is entitled to a lunch but as a business stagger the lunches to accommodate your patients. When they eventually opened I was told to wait because they still had not contacted my insurance? (You'd think that this is something they would have had completed prior to my visit) Anyways I filled out paperwork, she still couldn't find my insurance so asked for my insurance card. I waited for 30-40 minutes before I was taken back. There were other people seen before I was and mind you I had an "appointment", when the doctor eventually got to me he REFUSED to address the issue I had come in there for, he stated that I needed to have the issue addressed on my next visit as "he" was busy and had other patients waiting!!? So they just decided to only clean my teeth which felt extremely chalky after they so called "Polished" my teeth. They didn't even rinse my mouth!! I had to ask for water so I could rinse myself, and she said there are cups over in the corner and there is the faucet sink!? I have never had a dentistry preform such mediocre work talk about doing the bare minimum. I felt as if my teeth were 10 times filthier then what they were before I went in. You will be doing yourself a disservice by going to this dentistry so I advise you to not even waste your time and if you are going on a lunch break you can forget about returning to work because the service takes so long!!< /text>< pictures>

<review>I Highly highly recommend Clovis Family Dentistry. I wish I would have found them a long time ago. Thank you to the entire staff for being so friendly & professional. Not sure if I got lucky, but I had zero wait time on anything. I love the gifts they gave me as a new patient. Super happy I was referred to them! No one can match this place. It's about time someone is doing it right. Thank you!< /review><name>Kim Ahl</name><gmapID>0x80945b6f6ae39a81:0x3f66812f7b146ccc</gmapID><Response>None< /Response></record>

<review>Dr. Ray Lander And Dr. Michael Kezian are both very attentive and friendly. I recently chipped off my front tooth and they were able to accommodate me the same day. My tooth looks better than before. Their services are top notch.
Their front desk staff is always helpful and willing to assist with any requests.
I highly recommend your giving them a try.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>I honestly would not recommend this place... I SPECIFICALLY scheduled my appointment on a day I knew I was free but then when I arrived, I was told my appointment was yesterday & that they called me “twenty times”. I never got a single phone call. Also, when I told them if they could clean my bottom teeth because I have problems with them due to wearing braces. So, Dr. Lander SARCASTICALLY told me to go on YouTube to watch videos on how to clean them instead of him teaching me since he is the DENTIST! If only I could tell my insurance not to pay them for a VERY POOR service, I would.<//text>< Pics>

<review>Of all the dentists I've been to, Dr. Lander is by far the best. They have state of the art equipment that allows you to have your teeth fixed in one appointment. They also have financing to help make it affordable. I am more than happy with my new dental work and will be back for more.</review>< Pictures>

Everyone is super nice here. The dentist really made me feel comfortable. I hadn't been to the dentist in 8 years prior, so I knew there would be a lot of work to be done, but they are taking it slow and easy with my corrections. Would highly recommend this place.< /Text>

Most horrible experience ever had at an office.  The dentist continues to yell at his staff while patients are in the chair getting work done.  He came out yelling at me when I asked about a charge that is supposed to be covered and told me to get out of his office if I was going to continue to question him.  He proceed to yell at me and then turn on his staff and yell at them for not telling me to leave when it was asked the first time about the billing.  His staff was nice and apologized and said they don't know why they continue to work there for him.   Would not recommend this office, unless you are looking for a cleaning and a chewing.</Review>

Our family has been coming to Clovis Family Dentistry since they opened up their doors. We are thoroughly pleased with the state of the art dental technology that they have. The name of the business has a key word in it: FAMILY!  There has never been a dental office that our family has gone to that has the the type of customer service that they exhibit. Dr. Lander and the entire staff are the best dental office in the Central Valley!</review>

Horrible experience here. After my second visit I was treated poorly by Lander himself, the girl who was helping him that day continually apologized for his behavior saying his hygienist was on vacation and he becomes very anxious when she's gone. At the end of my visit I asked for the remainder of my money since I told Lander to stop working on me because I was very uncomfortable. 3 months later and I'm still waiting on my reimbursement, thankfully my insurance representative stepped in and gave them a call which forced them to pay what they owe because they did try to short me by $49 on top of everything else. My representative told Katie the O.M to wait for my response in mailing my check or me picking it up...the next day I went to pick up my check and they said, oh we put it in the mail.....just another way to give me a hard time and avoid me receiving my money. Ive had to deal with these rude, unprofessional people way longer than I like to. Jazzy or Jasmine is rude and horrible too!!! What a nightmare. There was plenty of other conversation that took place and things they did but in short this sums it up.< /review>

<name>Suzy West<//name><Text>So I'm one who hates going to the dentist. I'm sure there are a lot of "us". Well until now...let me give you a brief summary. I saw the office frequently as its across from a restaurant my husband and I frequent. I always saw the sign one day crowns. Well, as luck would have it, I broke a filling. I remembered the the sign, one day crowns, and gave Clovis Family Dentistry a call. The office staff was very friendly, and they got me in immediately. By the time I left my appointment, my tooth was newly crowned!! I know, right? That was my first appointment. Needless to say I've been back. With very affordable insurance offered by them  there is no reason to have an unhealthy mouth. Office staff, very friendly. Dr Ray Lander not only want to do a great job, he wants to be sure you are comfortable while there. Their dental hygienist, Melissa Lawson is amazing, letting you know how the process is going. She gets excited when she sees improvements which is a motivating factor for me. I can't say anything about Michael Kezian as I haven't seen him as my dentist YET. However if he is to be in this office, I would doubt he is anything but great too. My over all  review has to be GREAT, as I've gone back and now consider them my dentist.< /Text>< pictures>

The dentist was pleasant and polite. The REST of the OFFICE/RECEPTION STAFF was extremely argumentative,  rude and condescending. They argued with a lady about the time of her appointment even though she had a text FROM THEM confirming her appointment time. I've NEVER been to a dentist office with a staff like this and will never go back. As a health care professional,  with 30 years experience, I recommend taking your business somewhere else. PS Don't touch their coffee machine or you will be scolded and given instructions like you are a child.<//Review>

<text>My family has been going here for a couple years and our Dentist is Michael Kezian, who is very good at what he does.
You can always tell when I person loves what they do, and it shows in their passion and attention to detail.
I recommend everyone looking for a dentist to come see Michael... plus if you need your kids to start flossing: he can tell them outlandishly funny things like, the tooth fairy told me you aren't flossing and she is only going to give money for the best flossed teeth.
Anyhow, the rest of the staff is great and very concerned with your comfort, but if you are too needy... they don't give you a free toothbrush kit. Ha Ha ha< /text>< response>

<Review>I've been in and out of here a few times for various services, including extractions done today. Dr. Kezian and the assistant (Natalie is her name, I believe) were compassionate, professional and did everything they could to make me comfortable for the extractions. I plan on coming to this office regularly for all my dental needs and I would highly recommend them to others. Very friendly atmosphere and professional work.</Review>< gmapID>

<text>I am so happy to recommend Clovis Family Dentistry and Dr. Kezian. He (and the entire staff) were extremely professional, efficient and kind. Excellent communication throughout my experience w/them. Highly, highly recommend them.

Had another crown done this time with Dr. Lander. I couldn't be more pleased with the both the office and my results. He has an amazing technique with the novocaine that makes it numb, but doesn't linger all day long like other places! Price was very reasonable, too. Highly recommend this practice!<//text>< userid>

Dr Landers you, your wife and your staff have changed the total look, feel, & comfort of going to the dentist.  You make people feel that they & their health is the most important above all.  There is not a better dentist around.
P.S.  The flat screen TV in every room & the coffee machine doesn't get any better.< /Text>

I moved to Fresno a few months ago and have been looking for a good dentist.  Last week I lost a crown and my search became urgent.  I didn’t know where to start looking so I called my insurance company and asked for a dentist with good reviews.  After reviewing several dentists, I decided to try Dr. Ray Lander at Clovis Family Dentistry.  Dr. Lander studied dentistry in Boston and also taught dentistry at the university.  I felt good about his experience and credentials posted on the review.

I can only say that I really believe I struck gold when choosing Clovis Family Dentistry!  From the moment I called and spoke to Kelly about losing my crown, I was impressed.  She was able to get me in the next morning.  She was very pleasant, professional and understanding.  Upon arriving, Kelly and the rest of the staff greeted me.  (They had just finished their morning meeting, so all were present).  Immediately I noticed their kindness and smiles.  Kelly took me on a tour of their office, introducing me to staff along the way, and gave me a nice welcoming gift!   The office was very clean and decorated with European charm.

I was called in quickly by Jasmine.  She set me up in an exam room, made sure I was comfortable and then began with X-rays and preparing things for Dr. Lander.  Jasmine is wonderful!  She’s very knowledgeable, quick and pleasant. She’s there to help you!

Dr Lander came in a few minutes later.  He was very pleasant. He had reviewed the X-rays, checked my teeth, determined  treatment and discussed my treatment plan with me.  There was absolutely no pressure, just precise, expert knowledge!  I decided to go ahead with the new crown, but I had no idea he would make a beautiful, great fitting crown by himself in less than an hour!  I even got to observe as he designed the new crown on a special computer!  Amazing!!!

I couldn’t help but notice that Dr. Lander has several dentistry students in his office.  They work very closely with him to learn hands on experience.  I consider them very lucky to learn from such a highly skilled professional!  I left there feeling great and very much satisfied with their service!

I returned the next day for a full exam and cleaning.  Melissa did my cleaning.  She was so great!  I had a back tooth that I’d been concerned about for a few years but my prior dentist said he couldn’t find anything wrong with it.   Well.....Melissa found three cracks in that tooth!  She did a great job cleaning my teeth and explained what I needed to do to maintain healthy gums and teeth. Melissa spoke to Dr. Lander regarding my problem tooth and he quickly examined it.  He confirmed the cracks and showed them to me on the overhead tv.  Yes, I need another crown!  Luckily I have great insurance and there’s enough left for a second crown.

Dr. Landers wife works with the insurance and she was absolutely wonderful at explaining all the details!!!

I’m 64 years old and have seen many dentists in my life.  I’ve never been so impressed with the entire staff as I have been with the wonderful people st Clovis Family Dentistry!
Go see them the next time you need any kind of dental treatment. Dr. Lander and his staff are kind, caring, professionals who make going to the dentist a good experience!!!  I’m so happy I chose Clovis Family Dentistry!!!< /Text>

I normally would not write a review for anyone however the office of DR. Lander impressed me with their professionalism, modern techniques, and willingness  to spend whatever time needed in order to make me the patient feel very comfortable with the services being preformed.< /text>

<review>Dr. Lander was incredibly professional and pleasant upon my initial encounter and consultation.  Initially I conveyed that I had a filing that had shown signs of wear and the mercuric alloy was chipped.  The determination was that I needed two crowns, so reluctantly I scheduled an appt for the filings and crowns.  The initial crown took a little more time than the estimate had called for however there’s no rationale in complaining for speed when quality is desired.  Dr. Lander assured me that despite the wait, his equipment in the lobby was far superior to any other technique in practice currently and claimed we would work on the fillings next visit.  On my second visit I unfortunately was scheduled concurrently with a staff meeting, which appeared to simply be a random sales rep dropping by with lunch.  Working in healthcare myself I passed no judgement and decided to maintain my bias internally, however I did inform the receptionist that I still had patients at two separate facilities to work with afterwards.  I was reassured that I would make my timeframe.  I was seated about 45 min after my appointment & then worked on another 45 minutes later.  The individual working under Dr. Lander had a distinct personal disposition, which was only discovered after the good Dr. wasted 10 minutes unsuccessfully searching for him before delegating. His affect was such that it glistened with overwhelming apathy and a distinct inflation of ego evidenced through unilateral discussion as to his qualifications and income. Unfortunately his arrogance was not based in reality as he took incorrect measurements for the crown only to have Dr. Lander discover an hour after its creation that the crown did not provide adequate coverage of the dentin leaving a large portion uncovered.  I spent almost 6 hours in that office through multiple errors directly related to staff competence.  Missed my scheduled appointments with my own patients, and never had the work done that prompted my initial visit.  Unfortunately at this time, when amends could have been made I was further insulted and treated like some cheap college student on their parents insurance, as he proceeded to explain to me that his day was difficult and offer me $20 in movie tickets.  Dumbfounded and incredibly frustrated I informed him that I would like the funds refunded for the filings that were not performed.  I was assured they refund would process in several days.  I waited over 30 days and called twice before having to file a chargeback with my credit card company.  The Dr.  here is great, he knows what he is doing and is skilled, however I feel his implementation of technology coupled with several poor staff members, has compelled my frustration and such a scathing review.< /review>< Date>

<name>Estela Acebedo-Gonzalez< /name><Review>I received services over one year ago. Paid off my account and a year LATER received a bill. I have not been able to contact anyone either than the receptionist who is extremely unprofessional and rude. They have stated they will call me back with a "decision" on what the final "overdue" charges are but three weeks later I have not heard back. They engage in very bad business practices and are extremely unprofessional. I DO NOT recommend using their services.   I agree with pked9 who stated that the front desk staff is very RUDE.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>I would give this place 0 stars if possible. As a patient I have never felt so uncared for by a healthcare professional, EVER.

I went into this office about 2 months ago as a new patient. The staff initially was friendly and told me about all the fun prize drawings they have, ect...

At that time, I was given a treatment plan and was told how much I would have to pay out of pocket for my co-insurance. I went ahead and paid the $80.00 and scheduled my next appt to get the work done. Well, today, I went in and while I was in the chair with the numbing medication in my mouth, the Dentist comes in, barely acknowledges me, then starts discussing the treatment plan with his assistant, as if I was not even in the same room. The problem was what he discussed with her was completely different than the treatment plan he had initially outlined and that I had paid for. When I stopped and asked him why the change, he couldn't give me a straight answer and instead told the assistant he had 2 other appointments to do and he left!! Apparently he didn't have the time, decency or compassion to explain these changes to his patient.  So then his receptionist comes in and advises me that I will have to pay even more money to get this new work completed. It was at this time that I took my bib off, asked for a refund and left.

I have worked in the healthcare field for over 12 years and as a patient I have NEVER felt like just a number/time slot until today. It was the most uncomfortable feeling ever and practically had me in tears.

In addition to this, I expressed my concern on their Facebook page and of course my comment was soon deleted and I was blocked from their site. I wouldn't be surprised if its deleted from this site as well.

So, if you want a free Ipad or TV, go ahead and try your luck with this dentist. But if you want a compassionate Dentist that takes the time to explain things to you patiently and truly cares, I would highly recommend that you go elsewhere.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Simple, easy and fast. At Walmart it's affordable. They don't charge $100 and over.

If I could give them no stars I would they advertise 8 am opening only to have walk into the store to find out from a manager by the way they sometimes open 8am most times at 10am ? I guess they get to decide when they want to open ? Went back at 10 waitibg another 30 minutes ? No one to answer the phone or no way to leave a a message ? Btw the way the sign on the wall i noticed said 12pm to 6pm open ? So I would definitely call to confirm they are open or you will have wasted about 3 hrs of your day for nothing like I did.<//review>

You will be waiting all day. We waited for an hour and left the battery to charge only to be told the battery was no good. Supposedly, we should've known that within 15 minutes of testing the battery. Another woman and her family waited two hours for basic stuff, she requested to cancel and get her car back.<//text>

Very understaffed !! The associates were friendly, but were VERY busy. I needed to buy 4 tires and have them mounted and balanced. The tire shop was so understaffed that they didn't know how long it would take to get the job done. I ended up just purchasing the tires and had them mounted somewhere else.  Great price on the tires though !!...</Review>

They work hard and they are inexpensive but they lost our key and we had to wait a long time. Only game in town Sunday afternoon. Following up two days later an assistant manager paid us the cost of the replacing the key at the dealer since our car is leased and the dealer requires two original name brand keys on return, nearly $500. Problem solved but took quite a bit of time and trouble. We provided a written estimate from the car dealer. Walmart assistant manager gave us a $20 store card for our time and gas.< /review>

Better price on synthetic oil changes then any other place around, tires installs are always cheaper than other places, and battery prices usual beat anywhere else by $10+ atleast, got to arrive early(before they open) to get a quick service on your vehicle or your looking at a long wait is the only downfall.< /text>

Today I went here.  This place are so unprepared and plus they are not moving as to accommodate people. Kim the clerk was doing the best she can then the computer had no paper. Her Co workers did not think quick to get papers and she had to be the Brainerd for all of them. Then my car was check in , I started seeing the technician pulling in cars from the back while my car was in front. I see trucks and pick up trucks being serviced more than any other vehicles.  I guess if I had a Silverado and or Ford truck I would get better service. I ask Kim why were vehicles at the back were getting serviced first than my car. She said it goes by the order of the board. Then I look at the board there is no order . You could put your paperwork any way or anywhere on the slot. My vehicle was in front for oil change . Then they decide to bring in vehicles in the back. Basically, they can pull whatever work order they want. I think the system here is corrupted and full of favortism. And they discriminate which vehicle to work on first. BE AWARE OF THIS FACILITY.

Please sent this to the WALTON FAMILY . WALMART OWNERS

To people.tgatbare reading this . This can be a very good lawsuit against this company and this facility.< /text>

<Review>I was one of the first customers to get to the Walmart Auto Care at 8 am & was told my tire change (all 4) would be done before I had work at 11 but I was stuck waiting for my tirees for nearly 3 hours. I was really disappointed and the customer service was not great they seemed just as annoyed as I was.</Review>< Rating>

I was greeted by the very professional Bryan.  My car had stopped and I couldn't drive it.  Bryan made me feel so much better.  He towed my to the auto repair shop and dropped me off at home.  I simply LOVED his attitude and conversation.  Bryan keep up the good work and I know you have a promising career ahead of you.  Thank you so much.</text>

He is so awesome please SOMEBODY GIVE HIM A RAISE OR SOMETHING HE WORKS WAY TO HARD he got to me in less than 15 minutes and had my vehicle on the way in less than 10 he was super understanding with my financial situation and offered solutions to help reach a consensus and man was I BLESSED to have been taken care of by DANIEL!!!!<//Review>

The driver was very professional, very friendly, and very understandable. Unfortunately, I did not get his name but he picked up my Camaro and took it to the collision center, we had some obstacles with the towing yard, not his company but the original towing company that took the car during the accident And once again, he was very understandable and waited until the car was released to him. Outstanding service!!!!<//text>

Manny came to my home in Lake Arrowhead with my disabled vehicle in the driveway. Within 15 mins the my car was loaded onto the flatbed truck. When AAA gave me the link for Manny’s ETA, he came faster than what I thought. I arrived at the dealership in Ontario at exactly the time I estimated. Manny provided excellent service and he is a model for which other roadside technicians should strive to be. Roy and Dot’s Towing has a wonderful person in their midst! Manny has a huge heart! Thank you so very much!!</review>

<Text>Great service, friendly and quick response time. We needed to get towed and Angel attended to our call on and took care of everything for us. Angel was highly professional and very friendly. I would highly recommended this towing company to take care of your car needs. If we ever need to call a tow truck we’ll be sure to contact Roy & Dot’s Towing.</Text>< Pics>

Honestly what a great tow truck driver. Was stuck up in Crestline and the local company just wouldn't show up for whatever reason. This guy showed up and was very polite and took care of everything, only complaint which I'm not too sure who's to blame was that when AAA called me to tell me that they found this company that they were 2 to 3 hrs out and would call me to let me know when they'd be there, instead I got a text message saying they were 30 Mins away! Lol so I left work and headed to the house to make sure someone would be there to relieve the truck. It took about an hr from the time I got called by AAA to having a tow! Unbelievably great really but I do feel the company should call to confirm. Other than that it was a super streamlined and excellent experience so I'm giving this company 5 stars!🌟🤩✨<//Review>

<text>Thank you Roy and Dots towing. Your driver was courteous and professional. He picked up my truck and took it to  to the AAA approved tire shop when I got a flat tire on the freeway. The tire shop couldn’t accommodate my tires, so the driver went back and picked up my truck and took it to another shop That was capable of Replacing a 26 inch tire. I was not at the first location when he arrived to pick up my truck. He called me to verify that that’s what I wanted. I was very grateful for the extra effort on his part of making that extra phone call to verify the change.I definitely would recommend Roy and Dots towing to anybody that needs a tow.</text><Name>Ang Cost< /Name>< time>

He also assured me that he would make sure my tow bar was placed back and windows closed. Furthermore,  he called to let me know the car was dropped off at my mechanic in Orange. Thank you again Vincent and Roy & Dot"s . I know it wasnt a fun tow due to the distance,; nonetheless,  AAA has great connections with amazing company's.  Amen!!!

<Text>Awesome experience today with Roy & Dots Towing.  Came for a tow via Geico. Very knowledgeable and friendly in person and on phone.  Tried to crank car, said battery and then threw on a battery pack and car cranked right up!  Diagnosed it perfect.

Great service and accurate diagnosis.  Even a couple minutes early on arrival!  Thanks, Roy & Dot's Towing!!!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

They got me off the side of the freeway pretty quickly, and the driver, Bob, was excellent at assisting me and my vehicle! Very careful and caring--he even drove me towards the nearest exit to guide me to where I needed to go, so that was really appreciated! Definitely would recommend if you need fast help with customer service.<//Text>< pics>

Roy & Dot’s was sent to me by AAA with an estimated arrival of 1 hour. The driver Brian was there in 15 minutes! He took great care loading my truck onto the tow bed and gave me a lift to the mechanic. Brian provided excellent service and helped me get on with my day.<//review>

This is a very good tow company. I didn't get the driver's name, but he. was very professional and polite. They kept in touch with me to let me know when they would arrive. I would hire them even if I wasn't covered by my insurance company.. I give them five stars on every thing.</Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I got stuck in the mud yesterday morning. I called different tow agencies for estimates and wait time. Roy and Dots Towing was amazing from the time I called until the time they got me out of the mud. Angel was the driver whom came to “rescue” me. I was having a terrible morning and I was not in a very good mood, but Angel was sweet helpful and had a great sense of humor. He really turned an unfortunate situation into a great customer service experience. I will NEVER forget how he went above and beyond for me and my sanity. Lol. This guy Angel was in the mud in the water in the cold shoveling mud and still kept a smile on his face the whole time. I truly appreciate great customer service and Angel did just that. Thank you Roy and Dots Towing for hiring someone whom represents your company in such a wonderful way. I will definitely recommend you guys and thank you for turning a terrible start of my day into a great experience. Angel don’t ever change your wonderful customer service skills. Roy and Dots Towing 👍🏼Keep up the great work.< /Text>< pics>

The guy OMG was so unprofessional he’s was trying to flirt with me the entire time so much he forgot to tie one of the hooks when we took off. Almost damaged my car. Than he said o it’s because your your emergency brake wasn’t on and tried to blame it on me. Hope I never get a tow from this company and after on the ride he was like can you get on the internet and give me a good review they give bonuses for me. Like seriously after that hell no
Think he’s name was Vincent or victor has tattoos I was so uncomfortable in the truck😒<//Text>

Bob , the driver assigned to pick up our car was very professional, came on time and followed up with me by phone about status of my wife’s car (a newer model Mercedes Benz C300) he delivered to our mechanic at Walnut Hills Auto Repair. He knows his responsibilities and sticks by the AAA strict standard. Bob is knowledgeable and dependable. I highly recommend Bob and the company he represents. Good job Bob!👍👍👍...

I have a 2006 Bmw 750 Li and two other tow trucks came prior and because my car didnt go into neutral, they couldnt help me.  Because of this issue, i had to leave my car overnight and deal with it in the morning. Miguel came with perfect knowledge of my car, used my key to unlock the gears down by the break and also showed me that i have a tow hitch in my trunk. Amazing!!. Thank you Miguel so much.<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

I needed my truck towed to a repair shop. Whitin minutes of calling, I received a text saying a driver was on the way, and a few minutes after that, Angel was at my apartment gate! Extremely fast service, and Angel is kind, friendly and professional. I will use this tow service again!< /review>

Thieves Thieves Thieves. when I called to report almost 15k worth of goods stolen they never responded. Then I went in to make a in-person report I waited 2 hours for some fat smelly woman to come talk to me and she said "our cameras don't work" and when i asked to talk to the owner she told me "he's helping poor people." Since my iPhone was stolen i went to find my iPhone and guess where the last spot was it was on. Right here at roy and dots. Then I met one of there drivers who sold me some drugs. He was cool and told me the fat woman is always the one stealing but since she's the supervisor she gets away with it.</Review>

<review>They arrived sooner than I was told, towing service contacted me within minutes of AAA contacted them. Then I was greeted and helped by Bob who fixed my car and was incredibly nice in a day when everything seemed to be going wrong. Thank you for the help, the speed in which you handled it and the encouragement (which is not typically included) :)< /review>< pics>

Tim was early and took his time to insure our classic car, with special towing needs came off the truck in the same condition it went on. Then he helped push it into the garage.  What more could you ask for.< /text>

<review>They not only charge prices not allowed in regards to towing fees they also don't care of anyone knows or they can't do anything about it. The half owner enjoyed spending 10 mons cussing and yelling at me which I advised him I was recording it and he said he didn't give @$*& of I was. They overcharge on hourly rates and pick up fees<//review>< Pictures>

<review>Used to work for dave it was the biggest mistake I've made he thinks because he is having money problems he doesn't have to pay his employees or fix the crappie trucks he has still owes me, ex and current employees money and instead of making payroll he will faithfully buy Dodger tickets and hit the bar down the street after work. I'm surprised he hasn't ended up in jail for all the shady things he does...... I suggest everyone take their money elsewhere. It's just a matter of time before aaa finds out everything about this clown they will cut him off like Rialto PD and other agencies did ... Pass this info on< /review>< GmapID>

This place was the perfect place to help us with our furniture buying experience.  They recognized the balance we needed between browsing independently and having help nearby. When we needed answers, our sales guy always had them.  On top of everything, the sales rep made us feel very at home with how he interacted with our 6 month old throughout the process.   Simply is the best!  Thank you so much.</text>

Store is offset in the back, use navigation to find easier.

Worked with Don, super friendly, took his time and answered all of our questions. All the staff was excellent. Store had a vast array of all kinds of furniture and great deals. COVID has delayed all deliveries of non-stock custom items, but after visiting 5 furniture stores this is normal. 89$ delivery fee, extra $100 if you want them to remove the old couches.

Bought a big couch and will update this review to include delivery and set-up when the couch is received.

Purchasing experience 5 🌟
Selection 4.5 🌟
Delivery.. coming soon
Condition Arrived.. coming soon< /text>

One of the best places to buy good quality furniture for your home. They warranty what they sell. I brought a fouton back that needed one of its legs repaired and they fixed it at no cost. I highly recommend this place. Friendly staff and good selection.< /review>

We have bought three pieces of furniture here over the years and have been happy so far! They have a huge selection of furniture for your home and they usually can give you a bargain price.  The salesman who helped was Don and he's been professional and helpful.  I highly recommend this furniture outlet because you'll get a lot for more for your money here.</text>

I would not recommend this place to anyone. The information the sales rep give is a bunch of bologna. They are quick to make a sale but it takes FOREVER to get your furniture. I order over 6 pieces of furniture and they have  all come in at different times. The worse part is they will try to charge you for delivery fees each time or they will hold all your furniture. It’s been over 4 months. This place is no good. You are better off spending the extra money somewhere else.

If I could give zero stars I would. The worse I have ever been too. Save your time and money!!! No customer service at all. They will not call you to give you an update you have to keep calling them and beg them for the items you paid for!! 😤 😡 😠<//Review>

They're not pushy and work with you to get exactly what you want. In talking with Don we weren't finding a couch we wanted and he mentioned they had just had one delivered. He thought we might like it, took us back to their receiving department, opened the box, and that's the one we bought.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Had a great experience with the folks at Simply Discount Furniture; Josh was incredibly knowledgable and made the process an easy one. I was able to stay within budget while getting a high quality mattress. Well worth my time on a holiday weekend, only thing I wish I had done differently was start with Simply Discount Furniture instead of shop around.< /Review>

Selection is great, employees are knowledgeable, courteous, helpful and attentive. The store is huge they've got sofas, beds, tables, outdoor furniture you name it. Credit or no credit they will help you out, will like to thank Steve for his help. If you get a chance and shop there ask for him really outgoing and makes your time at the store not so boring.< /review>

<review>I bought a set of California storage king bedroom set plus a 16" high  mattress from this store. The mattress turned out to be too high for the bed, so I contacted them and asked them to replace it with a 10" one. They agreed to do so but after delivering the second mattress, it turned out to be  smaller than a regular cal. King. So again I contacted them and again they agreed to replace it with my choice of another one of their mattresses.
I'm super happy both with their customer service and also with their affordable prices. I'll definitely be buying more furniture from them and I highly recommend this store to everybody.

Thank you Steve and Gus.</review>< pictures>

We always get excellent service and prices here. We recently purchased all new mattresses at Simply Discount. Joseph helped us and was knowledgeable, but did not pressure us. We’ve purchased our living and family room couches here and have always been happy with our choices. Shop around to all the other stores in the area, then come to Simply Discount to get the same thing at a fraction of the price!</text>

Bruce is the man he's very knowledgeable and friendly he didn't sugar-coat anything he is an honest salesman went in there to buy a mattress for the truck and told him what we wanted so he suggested another mattress which was a couple dollars cheaper he explained how it would last longer and is way more comfortable than the one we originally went in there for  I will definitely come back because of him if he leaves I leave thanks Bruce<//Text>

<text>Nice store once your able to find it, because it sits way back from the road. It's been a while buying furniture from a retail store.  When I did they had the advertised merchandise on hand or if I had to wait a week so be it. This particular store told me one week for the vanity set we wanted in white, I Said ok I'll wait for your call so I can come pick it up, well I never got a call and was told the manufacturer won't be able to ship the item for a month. I don't know if this is the norm but that taught me a lesson to find out first if it's in Stock if not look elsewhere if there is no compensation like free delivery or something for the inconvenience of the new wait time.<//text><Rate>2</Rate></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Looking for a certain size sofa and the gentleman helping us said "they don't make those anymore" - which is completely untrue as we had just come from a furniture shop with at least a dozen options in our requested size range.  Ended up visiting a few more stores and ordered exactly what we were looking for - also at a fair price.</review>

A coworker recommended this place to me. Huge warehouse. Too many great items to choose from and reasonably priced. Got a great table and chairs and reclining sofa. I will definitely be back for more!</Review>

Arrived with a purpose to not have to go anywhere else to furnish a newly leased 2 bedroom apartment. Jerry is the man. A good business deal leaves both parties hurting just a little bit. For me, my pockets were lighter. For jerry, he had to conjure up some magic and add some icing on the cake. Once I'm settled in, I'll certainly be heading back here to get the loose ends tied up.< /text>

<Text>I bought my daughter a bed with a pull out bed beneath it from them as their price beat their competitors price.  After the bed was delivered and assembled, I made the bed with new sheets.  Upon finishing making the bed, I merely sat down on the middle of the bed to appreciate my purchase.  Suddenly I heard a crack, guessing that it was just settling or something, when a much louder crack sound occurred and it broke, buckling right where I was sitting.  I called Simply Discount and informed them, then went to the store to discuss further.  I didn't really offer any options, so I informed them that I would like credit back and they could come pick up the bed.  I then proceeded to flip thru their catalogs and found another bed that seemed sturdier.  The original bed was $399, and the new bed I found was $599.  I asked for credit on the broken bed and if they could do anything else.  They offered me free shipping on new bed, as well as waving the assembling fee.  I was satisfied with this, though I do wonder how a more timid customer would have been treated.
More recently I spent around $1000 on some more furniture (recliner/rocker and 2 accent chairs) and so far am pleased with the treatment/prices I've found there.< /Text></record>

HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!  This is your warning!  Do not buy from Simply Discount Furniture.  You will regret it!  They do not stand by their products.  They told me if I bring back the couch, they will either fix it or give me store credit. They said that I would need to find a way to bring it back (170 mile round trip).  I did and when I got there, they said "sorry, it's not fixable and warranty is up".  I spent over $10K there on 2 houses of furniture and they wouldn't replace or give me store credit for a couch I paid $450 for?  It is obviously defective and they are still selling it in the store. I checked.  Go to Ashley or Easy Life. They are much better!!</text>

<review>They lost my order. I called to try and figure out why no one called me about the furniture I ordered (it had been over a month and they said it wouldn't only take 2-3 weeks for it to arrive), and they said they couldn't help me unless I could find the order number on the claim ticket they gave me when I left. Considering I had moved and it had been over a month ago, I couldn't find that ticket. Even though I was able to provide a reference number from the charge on my credit card, the details of the order, the date it was placed, and the amount that was charged to my credit card, they said they couldn't help me. I'm still waiting to find out whether they'll refund my credit card, or actually fulfill the order. Their unwillingness to help and dismissive response to the issue makes me truly think these people are con artists. Such a horrible way to do business.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I'm an AVID researcher.  I conduct loads of research before any purchase. I don't rely solely on Yelp/online reviews because they are so easily skewed.  I should have headed the low star ratings this time.  ;/

Yes, the prices at Simply are good.  The customer service (while IN the store) is great.   The salesmen aren't pushy and awkward.  Jerry was knowledgeable and helped me find EXACTLY what I wanted.   Honest and straight forward.

HOWEVER, if you get a defective product..... You're on your own.   My sectional arrived defective.  A large metal piece hit the ground every time you sat down. I have hard wood floors and it sounded like you were going through the floor!  Less than ideal.  I notified Simply immediately. Like within 12 hours.  It was a holiday weekend so I understood when they didn't call me back.

I called again twice and emailed.  When I finally got someone to speak with me, she informed me because I picked up the couch myself....they wouldn't come get it. I needed to PAY to return it to the manufacturer.   Seriously?    So...they deliver a subpar, "clanky couch" and I had to pay $99 to return it to them.

I was stuck.   It's written in their contract in super fine print.  So....my bad.   I played their game, PAID to have it returned for them to fix.    I needed the couch and didn't want to argue.

Three months later....the same metal piece dangles down.  They fixed nothing.

Yes, I got a great "deal".  For a couch that sounds like your falling to your death upon sitting.

Awesome.

Pay and extra few hundred bucks and go somewhere else.  It's not worth the effort.

I suggest a re-name..... " Simply Hassle Furniture".< /text>

Good selection, the first visit seemed to go very well. As many reviewers have stated - I found good selection and liked the prices. My issue for the most part has been service. I would not tell people not go to this retailer - but I caution the company to strive to do better, because it was rather ridiculous.

I bought a bed for my 3 year old daughter, who of course has a mostly pink and white room. First of all - it came in and no one called me; no follow up as well. I went to pick it up, and it was BLUE - wrong color. The bigger issue was, at first - they COULD NOT FIND my order. I was sitting outside the loading bay for an HOUR.... They found two of the three pieces - so even if it was the right color, I was not going to get out easy.

What I hated the most was that there were probably two really friendly associates - and then a bunch of other people that just made me feel a bit uncomfortable around. It is not a common practice for this group to say hello, offer any form of small talk (which may be fine for some)

When you walk into a store and just stand there waiting awkwardly for anyone to acknowledge you are there - it is just weird. I mean the first rule of retail is environment, and they have a great show room and some good staff - but it doesn't feel like things are connected.

For example - when I went to pick up with bed, I realized I forgot my receipt - so I called them about 10 minutes away to ensure they would have my information and could pick up the bed.

You would think that if a customer calls saying they are 10 minutes away that the product would be waiting for them, or people would be expecting to see you... not the case at all. What the retailer did not know was that it was my wife's 29th birthday and I had to pick her up from a facial after this quick stop - that was nothing close to quick.

Again, order lost - wrong item anyways, poor communication of expectations to the client (me) that was waiting.

The gentleman who helped us out was phenomenal, and the back office seems to do a good job with phone calls and providing service. But in person - everything just feels so much worse. The care you get initially is perfect, but the follow up and the experience that leaves a lasting memory was poor.

I also have to say, it took me a while to actually find the place because they have no signs that say - turn in to this alley for simply discount furniture... so I could see it initially - but had no idea to drive up this little side road to get there.

All and all - many small things that could be done to improve. Again - this is me being constructive because I liked their selection, their prices were very competitive, and initially I felt very positive about the service... it just went downhill from there. Mistakes happen - but there is a better way to go about it. I felt like there was not enough transparency happening and I was just upset that I was not being considered. My time did not feel important when in actually really did matter.

To leave your wife waiting on their Birthday is not a good thing to do - if they were having issues, I would have preferred them to say - we are having issues and cannot get this to you quickly. If you wait an hour to pick up something that YOU KNOW has been there for weeks... then you got a problem. Especially when you leave empty handed.<//Text>

< review>
I tried to go to this store.  I couldn't make myself go in. First off as I was approaching I noticed furniture outside in the rain.  Secondly, I was trying to picture the big huge gaudy delivery truck pulling into my driveway and what kind of deliverymen would come out of it.  They made a horrible first impression on me and I don't want to see anymore.</review>

<Text>We heard about Wholesale Warranties from several different You Tube RV channels. We have been very happy with the service, price and coverage. We had a slight discrepancy with billing and it was resolved in our favor. The truth is, a software mistake created a more favorable scenario for us but we were willing to honor the original contract. They wouldn't hear it. They honored the mistake that saved us money!  Every interaction thus far, has been exemplary.  What a class organization. We are so happy to have these people on our side.<//Text>< Name>

One year ago we purchased a 2009 Beaver Monterey Sunset motor home with only 12,600 miles.  In searching for the best option for an extended warranty I found Wholesale Warranties out of San Diego.  My salesman, Steven Motz, kept in touch with me during the time we were negotiating the motor home purchase.  He was fabulous in helping understand their product and options.

After an exhaustive search we purchased from Wholesale Warranties.  Their price was fair and the service after the sale from their claims people has been efficient.  We have experienced a number of claims over the past year including Diesel Engine issues with our CAT C9 engine.

Each claim has been handled on a timely, fair basis.  When this warranty expires at the end of 4 years, my first call will be to Wholesale Warranties for a new extended Warranty.< /Text>

Great company. My fifth wheel has been warrantied through this company for the last three years.  They have quickly handled every claim and authorized parts needed without a hassle.  The customer service is some of the best I have ever experienced.</review>

Many things are not covered. We have had 3 claims rejected. One for the dash AC (failed fittings are not covered) one for the diesel generator (failed gaskets with resulting massive oil loss) and one for the Vacuflush toilet vacuum generator, which they say is not “expressly covered”. There is no appeal process. I would definitely not recommend them.<//Text>

I have never had a problem of any kind arranging repair services. In fact, we were at an RV repair facility in Chesapeake, Va. They seriously resisted accepting warranty policies for repairs. They wanted my creditcard first. In the end, the facility office manager praised their claim experience with Wholesale Warranty's service center. Payment was made with clear and reasonable justifications, unlike past experiences with other well known warranty companies. Thank you Wholesale Warranty, I am a happy camper.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1bvO-FIxKelmX8JCenojvhfdF1j62AVxspzTY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Our rig broke down on the way home from the dealer and it has been almost 4 weeks trying to deal with getting this company to approve the repairs and several cancelled airline tickets trying to get back to get it because they are so slow.  They will not approve the repair as the diesel facility recommends in order to have their repair warrantied from the Freightliner repair facility... they would rather have us breakdown again and go through this extreme delay and mess up a vacation to fix the rest.  Now we just got it approved and they are only going to pay for half the repair even though we got their best and most expensive plan and have a $200 deductible.  It is impossible to get ahold of anyone we try to talk to and they just want to deny every claim.  Save your money. BUYER BE WARNED.  also... Every repair has to be authorized or they will deny the claim, however, no one ever answers that line when you call.  RUN< /review><gmap_id>0x80dc071d8ca7bdf5:0x5b931e6f69a6c05d</gmap_id>< name>

In this day and age of wondering if you are going to get what you paid for. I was very,very, very blessed to have found Wholesale Warranty. They replaced 1 air conditioner, 1 tire and air bag and the most expensive of all my Norcold Refrigerator!! They paid everything except my deductible with no hassle of paying. Great company and their employees very knowledgeable and wanting to help you!! Can't say enough good about this company. One more thing to add is their rates were better than most of the other warranty companies I checked!!☺<//Review>

<Review>WOW!  My vocabulary is too small to verbalize my positive feelings and experiences I have had with Wholesale Warranties.  From the purchase of my plan to the claims process--flawless!!!  I can tell you without hesitation I will purchase a new warranty from Wholesale Warranties when the time comes and I can tell you if you are shopping for a RV Warranty look no further you have found the best!!! WHOLESALE WARRANTIES I would give them ten stars if I could!!!  Wholesale Warranties is the best value, best customer service, and allows me the confidence to hit the open road without having to worry about breakdowns or unexpected repairs.... I love this company.< /Review>< Pics>

<text>I once made the mistake of not having extended warranty I insurance on a motor home. In one year that was a $20k mistake. I purchased the extended warranty on my other two motorhomes and used it both times. Never had their services. Well worth every penny and peace of mind. Better pricing than the dealerships offer too.</text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc071d8ca7bdf5:0x5b931e6f69a6c05d<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

As new owners of an RV, we checked which were the top rated companies for extended warranties and chose you.  We didn't need to use it for a couple of years but then our electric step to the RV went out. We called and they covered it without question. We took it to the service place that was convenient for us and when we went to get it the claim had already been paid.  We were pleased with the response, as was our service provider.  Thanks for a job well done!</review>

<text>I had an Aqua-hot heating failure in my Ellipse.  Started a claim on-line that night and received a call early the next morning from Strategic Administrators.  Bob knew the Aqua-hot system and understood my problem.  I decided to find a certified Aqua-hot technician instead of just an RV mechanic and paid him directly.  Strategic Administrators reimbursed me a fair amount for the expense.  Very good experience for my first warranty claim.  Happy I chose Wholesale Warranty.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Best extended warranty service we have ever had, Many other companies could learn from them.  Previous company was nothing but grief and this experience was a pleasant surprise.  They worked quickly and pleasantly with our mobile RV repair service, Mathews RV Repair, Natalia, TX. I would highly recommend this company to anyone searching for an extended warranty on their RV.  Wholesale Warranties is an excellent company.<//Review>

Thank you Wholesale Warranties and my Viking Protection Plan!  When I purchased my new motorhome, my brother recommended that I get a 7 year warranty from you.  I shopped around and you had the best coverage at the best price.  Well, I guess you always wonder what will happen when you actually need something fixed under a warranty.  My macerator pump went out.  The repair shop called you.  You approved it right away.  Fixed the same day and we were back on the road!!  Great service!< /Review>

<Text>I thoroughly researched warranty companies before selecting Wholesale Warranties.  On our way back to Florida from Rhode Island this past September, our passenger side kitchen/living room slide stopped working.  As soon as we arrived back home in Florida, I called our RV dealer, made an appointment and took the motorhome in for repairs.  I gave the dealership the Wholesale Warranties info.  They called and got authorization and performed the repair work on the slide.  The whole experience could not have gone better.  Wholesale Warranties is definitely a 5 star company.  Thanks for a great experience.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80dc071d8ca7bdf5:0x5b931e6f69a6c05d</Gmap_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures><userid>115241337740172785185</userid><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

When we bought our new to us Class A Motorhome, the company we purchased from gave us the offer to take or decline warranty. As we had a bad experience with a dealer warranty we declined, but knew we would need to have something. FMCA sent an email explaining about after market warranties and we contacted them. Dealing with WW has been easy and painless and the price was less expensive than the dealers! Would recommend to anyone looking for extended warranty to check them out.<//Text>

I GIVE THIS INSURANCE A ZERO.I CANCELED THIS POLICY BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT PAY FOR NOTHING. I HAD TO PAY FOR ALL MY REPAIRS.  I  PAID $9,995, HAD IT FOR 1 YEAR AND 5 MONTH THEY ONLY REFUND $3,000.  I HAD TO BUY ANOTHER WARRANTY AND PAY FOR THAT WARRANTY BECAUSE THIS POLICY WAS USELESS.</Text>

<review>Worked with Terrance on obtaining the warranty, he was very knowledgeable, easy going, and patient. Kept to all set appointments and completed the information in quick time.  This is our first extended warranty, and does give us some peace of mind. Wholesale Warranties were heads above others. Glad to do business with them and Terrance!

<Text>New to the RV world. The warranty purchase and inspection process were very easy. My rep Shannon was very helpful getting me through the process. I haven't had to use the warranty yet so I can't comment on that part. But I hope it's as easy as the purchase process. I read good things about the company which is why I did not use another company the dealer recommended. Feedback from customers is always more valuable than a dealer recommendation which is commission driven. GREAT upfront process. Thanks Shannon.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>My power steps needed to be replaced and I took my RV to a small repair shop that I like.  They had never dealt with Wholesale Warranties but it turned out to be easy and seamless - for both of us.  My repair guy said he had no problems whatsoever getting approval for the repair/replacement. The repair and reimbursement were completed within 2 days. Needless to say I was extremely happy.  They did what they promised when I bought the policy 2 years ago.<//Review>< gmapID>

I looked around at several different warranty programs before settling on the one from Wholesale Warranties. They offered the best coverage at the best price. We worked with Buddy who was more then helpful sending us the information I needed to make the decision. We haven't had to use it yet and the proof will be when that happens. Our Trailer is still under the manufacturers warranty but I will update this review when I first have to use the Wholesale warranty. I hope the customer service is as good then as it was buying the warranty.< /text>

AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE! Everyone I spoke with was incredible. When we sold our RV I called to cancel the policy and they sent me info which I forgot to return to them. Well they even called me back to remind me that they needed the paperwork so they could send me a refund. Not many companies will call to remind you that they owe you money. We've since purchased a new RV and going to use Wholesale Warranties again because of their coverage and incredible service.< /text>

<text>Back in September in AZ I had my awning motor replaced and when I called in I was told to get a rv repair specialist to come out and give me an estimate for repairs. The company called wholesale warranties and got the okay to do the repairs. Great Job to Wholesale Warranties for taking care of this for me.<//text>< Pictures>

Top notch company and incredible customer service! I had a unique situation that required some research and resolution. I was treated very well and our issue was resolved. I have always been skeptical of warranties due to the bad reviews you often read online, but this company is much different. Since they are a broker for many warranty companies, I was pleased to see that Wholesale Warranties provided additional customer support even well after the policy was purchased. Our service was so positive, I wanted to make sure I shared that you have found a reputable and customer-focused company with Wholesale Warranties.</text>

I purchased their plan when I bought my RV and saved a great deal off what the dealer wanted to charge.  I have used Wholesale Warranties twice to effect repairs to my Class A mobile home, and have a third one in process.  Throughout the time I have had them in my corner, I have been completely impressed with their customer service, integrity, and responsiveness.
They have been by my side as a loyal partner.  This is my first RV, and I’m glad that I purchased their product.  They answer emails and phone calls promptly which is crucial!  Best purchase I’ve made for my RV</review>

If you are buying an RV, get in touch with these guys, you really need a warranty!< /Text>< Pics>

<review>We researched several companies and almost went with other major company for little cheaper price but my rep Terrance was so professional, prompt and knowledge that I changed my mind at the last minute to purchase the Wholesale warranties which has far better reviews from the users.

<Text>After days of research I settled on Wholesale Warranties for an extended service contract for our new/used travel trailer.  The price was slightly cheaper then the other reputable companies who had a 4.0 or above rating.  The positive comments that I received from my friends and the reviews is what sold me on this company.  The excellent service that I received from both Buddy and Renee added to my feeling of making the correct choice.  I feel confident that should I have a problem with anything that is covered they will be there to help solve it.</Text><Name>Robert Petrasek< /Name>< Rating>

A great experience.  We were referred by other RV folks that thought WW was the only good choice for an extended warranty.  Only time will tell for us.  We bought this with a new coach for 4 years since we are planning to sell in 2 years and felt a coach with 2 yrs of warranty would have a potential better value.  The service has been great and expect it will be that way forward.  Happy Glampers!</Review>

My RV is 4 years old and I figured it was time to get an extended warranty.  I got recommendations from friends and got quotes from three companies.  While Wholesale Warranties was more expensive than the other quotes, they had many fewer exclusions and seemed to provide better overall coverage.  I bought the contract on Friday.  The inspector called me the same day, and scheduled the inspection for Saturday.  He was prompt, informative, and professional.  So far, I have no complaints.  I'm anxious to see how it goes when I submit my first claim.  :-)</text>

<review>Stephen from Wholesale Warranties was a pleasure to work with. I researched a few different companies before deciding to go with WW. Stephen helped me make an educated choice without the usual high pressure push of most sales people. He gave me the right info to research the companies that I was interested in. In the end, it was obvious that Wholesale Warranties was the way to go. Personable, honorable, and affordable. I hope I never have to use it, but the peace of mind is well worth the price.</review>< Resp>

We hope to never need to use our warranty but feel comfortable all will go well if it is anything like their service so far.</review>< pictures>

Just purchased an extended warranty and working with Dennis was a real pleasure.  He was very knowledgeable, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure all my questions were answered before I purchased the contract. It seems that today customer service has been disregarded by most companies, but working with Wholesale Warranties has been a very positive experience as they actually put the customer first.  Thank you Dennis and Wholesale Warranties!< /review>

Many choices for extended warranty for RV.
The  WW staff was very helpful in providing options and prices.
Out of the 4 companies we considered WW provide the most complete coverage and support for out RV.
Special kudos to Katie our initial contact who worked with us to provide the best coverage.
We also found that all the staff we talked to at WW were friendly and cheerful which helped make our final decision.
We feel confident that we made a wise choice

This is my second motor home insured through Wholesale Warranties with the Viking Plan and I couldn't be more satisfied. They are a pleasure to speak with and repairs are done without a hassle. I will continue to recommend them to RVing friends.</Review>

I had my doubts that any warranty company would meet our needs for our RV. I waited to write this review because I thought "well they paid for the first claim fine but what will they do next?" Wholesale Warranties and the Viking Protection Plan have been consistently sound in their business dealings with me and the honoring of our warranty with them. We have a 2011 Newmar Baystar that has had "its share" of problems. When covered, Wholesale Warranties has come through on each claim in a courteous and professional manner.<//Text>

<time>1550641060700< /time><Rating>5<//Rating><text>I selected Wholesale Warranties based upon reading a large number of positive reviews on websites. We have had five claims over the past five years. Each time, when we advised a service employee that we had an extended warranty, they would complain about negative experiences when attempting to get paid. Four of the businesses accepted the work, and they were quite pleased when the payment was received before we left in our motorhome. One shop required us to pay out of pocket, so we called Wholesale Warranties, and we were reembursed without any problems. We had to wait a few days for inspections on the high-dollar repairs; however, none of our requests for repairs was ever denied. Thanks, y'all.

<gmap_id>0x80dc071d8ca7bdf5:0x5b931e6f69a6c05d</gmap_id><review>We purchased the warranty shortly after our existing warranty expired. I truly believe that doing so was probably the wisest decision I have made since becoming an RVer some 25 years ago. You see, approximately three months after purchasing the warranty from Wholesale Warranties, the ABS, Dash AC , and Leveling systems all decided to fail at once. If it had not been for the services provided by Dennis and John, I would have been adversely affected by this untimely catastrophe. Shortly after submitting a claim for repairs, the repair facility was promptly paid.

I believe that anyone who is seriously considering the purchase of a used RV or renewal of an existing warranty, should also purchase the product provided by Dennis and John through Wholesale Warranties. They are honest and professional people, and even called me personally to see how my experience  with the administration of the warranty claim went after completion of the repairs.

It's not a question of IF you will need the warranty, but a question of When!!!!

Thanks to Wholesale Warranties....Dennis, John, and the administrators of claims!

<rate>5< /rate><text>We have had to use our service warranty with Wholesale Warranties 4 times in the 1st year. I am delighted to tell you that each instance has been pleasant, helpful very efficient. In 3 of the instances WW paid the repair company direct with me only paying the deductable and shop fees. The only service company that would not take direct payment from WW was Freightliner so I had to pay the entire bill with a credit card. I was pleased to receive a check from WW in 4 days for their portion of the bill. I was a skeptic when I bought the service warranty because I am not a betting man or fan of insurance but I am so happy I did and will use WW in the future without hesitation.< /text>< gmapID>

<text>I was skeptical when dealing with the high pressure of a sales pitch and getting what is promised. After a lot of research and several conversations with Wholesale Warranties, I felt comfortable with our decision. It was also helpful with the videos that are available to review and learning what is and is not covered. I also was able to get a multiple year plan rather than a one year plan which was also beneficial. What would happen if I got a one year plan and wanted to extend and found my premium had drastically increased?
No claims yet, however I feel very comfortable now with our 11 year old motorhome.

I normally do not buy extended warranties based on Consumer Reports recommendations but my RV is very complicated and I was planning a very big trip across America so decided I should.  After much research and getting 3 quotes from different companies I picked this one.  Price wise they were in the middle but had great reviews, BBB rated highly and John was very helpful with my many questions. The follow-up call from Nic and Renee was also very friendly with a great attitude of "here to serve you."  While I didn't like writing such a big check for something I hope I never need to use after much research I felt they were the best extended warranty company out there.  Hoping I never have to use them but if I do I feel like I have a team behind me that believes in customer service.< /Text>

<Name>Venrick1< /Name><rating>5<//rating><Review>We had a radiator leak in our 40 foot diesel pusher motorhome while on the east coast in May, so we scheduled  our repair appointment with the nearest freightliner dealer. They determined that the radiator would need to be removed and have a new one installed as repair was not possible.  Our warranty people were very cooperative in working with the repair facility and 3 days later we were back on the road. The warranty covered all repair expenses and 2 nights lodging and meals, less our deductible. This helped us avoid laying out 4300 dollars!  The dealer did not take warranty payment so we payed them directly and we had our reimbursement check within a week.

We have not used the warranty yet which is very good.  However, we have been talking to other well known extended plan people and felt your company was the best.  Even better than our local RV repair shop's plan.  This is our third RV and also our third extended warranty and we wouldn't be without one.  Steve Motz explained every option clearly and without a lot of "fluff".  Thanks Steve...</Text>

The got us a ProTrek policy that was $2000 below the competition with a $200 deductible rather than $600 on the other plan.

I worked with Terrance Taylor to purchase a warranty for our motorhome. Terrance was great to work with: he was always professional, very patient, and responded to questions quickly. When we encountered a small hiccup, he was able to work with his team and get it resolved quickly and effectively. If you are in the market for an extended warranty for your RV, I highly recommend working with Terrance.</review>

<Text>We had several issues with our RV during our trip out west this summer. I spoke to John Wise while we were on the road and he provided answers to all of my questions.  Since none of the issues were catastrophic we decided to wait until we returned home to have the repairs performed.  Our local service center (Preventative Maintenance Service in Clearwater, FL) commented to me that they have never worked with a more professional and responsive extended service plan.  All of the repairs were authorized quickly by John and we had our RV back within a week.  This was the first time we used our Viking Protection Plan and it couldn't have gone more smoothly!<//Text>< Pics>

Steve and Dennis were very helpful in explaining the policy. Prior to visiting with the two gentlemen I was hesitant in purchasing a warranty, based on the dialogue with the others companies.

The two gents were great.  I thank both of you.  Once, Steve and Dennis did their magic of explaining the policy in detail, Renee came in to create her magic to process the policy to make it real.  She was very detail oriented and made sure everything was complete so no hiccups would occur.

All staff was extremely responsive to my questions and personal needs.  Thanks to all.  I hope the next 7 years will be as seamless as the beginning relationship, and if I need their assistance it will be without a headache and red tape.< /Text><date>1444095133693<//date>< GmapID>

<text>We were delighted with Stephen!  Great response - and he kept calling when he knew our manufacturer's warranty was expiring!  I hope we do not need to use it, but it does give us peace of mind if we do have a problem.  There are lots of electronics on these new motorhomes - and plenty that could go wrong!

Thank you!<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Where do I begin?

I have a friend that is a licensed RV repair person and he said "you better get an extended warranty, because if you have to replace a refrigerator it will cost you about $2000." I was concerned! So, I called whom he recommended. Bad, $3295. for three years, no easy down payment and terms for the balance. I also like the fact that a pre-inspection is required to prevent trying to get pre-existing conditions repaired.
The whole experience was great, from the first phone call to closing the deal.<//review>

The five stars are for Wholesale Warranties, their company did what they said would, and took care of a repair to our Motor home. We had just recently purchased the motor home used. My complaint was with the RV Repair Shop Double Eagle RV repair on Bolder Hwy in Las Vegas. I saw their add in Sams Town RV Park brochure, so I took our RV there. We talked to a lady at first, in my opinion she seemed to know what she was talking about as I wanted a few things done to our motor home. We went back to the shop to check on the progress and found that she no longer worked there, the guy we talked to seemed to not know what was going on even making a statement that he was just placed into the job and didn't know what was going on, said he needed time to go through the paperwork to get things straight, sounded reasonable to me so we said we would check back in a couple of days, which we did. He didn't know any more then than he knew before, I went over the things I asked to be done with our motor home such as the Generator Serviced including the belt changed, a leak on the roof fixed, mirrors tightened and the Hydraulic Jacks looked at (they were not working right when we purchased it) we also needed the turn signal switch replaced. The total bill they charged was $1721.00. ( it must be noted that Wholesale Warranties with the exception of my $200.00 deductible paid for the replacement of the turn signal)  When we finally went to pick up the motor home I asked what was done and was told the leak on the roof, (they had to replace some caulking around the air horn and antenna)  generator serviced, mirrors tightened, turn signal replaced and the hydraulic jacks were ok. After they brought the motor home out I inspected it and found the mirrors not tightened, where they replaced the caulking on the roof, they used white caulking and I have a black roof you can imagine how that looked, and the hydraulic jacks were doing the same thing they were doing when I took it in. I brought this to their attention and was told to let the them keep it overnight and they would fix this stuff.  So for $1721.00 minus my $200.00 deductible,  I got my Generator Serviced, mirrors finally tightened  and some black paint put on the caulk just where you can see it from the ground, as far as the hydraulic jacks they are still doing the same thing. In my opinion I would stay away from this place.<//review>

<text>Purchasing a large item as a Class A Motorhome is a large undertaking. Making sure your purchase is protected from large bills from breakdowns while far from home is something that you must consider. I purchased this vehicle from a RV dealer, of cause the dealer tried to convince me to purchased a extended warranty from them, at a very inflated price. I had seen the ad by Wholesale Warranty, on line, and contacted them for a quote on my unit. Mr Steven Motz gave me the quote which below what the dealer had given me. I then did some research on Wholesale Warranties on line and they came out with nothing but positive reviews. The prices and coverage was much better then the dealer. When I approached the dealer with WW quote, they said they could not match it. To the dealer, it was just a large profit income for them.  I am very happy with the experience of Wholesale Warranties, and highly recommend their honesty and professionalism.</text>< UserId.>

We've had multiple claims since purchasing our Wholesale Warranty for our 2007 Gulfstream Crescendo motorhome in 2013. Their responsiveness to our needs has been timely and courteous. Our claims have run the gamut from power converter, slide out mother board, air brake system dryer, and cooling system issues. The procedures are simple to follow, the policy is very clear re: coverages and you are not tied to a particular service center. We've had claims in Indiana, Montana, Nebraska and Arizona.

Strongly recommend Wholesale Warranties to anyone who is entering the RV lifestyle.

Great value for the price.<//Review>

We purchased an extended warranty last week for our brand new Thor Tuscany motorhome.  Dennis Wacker was extremely helpful in explaining the different types of coverage and how the Viking program actually worked.  His price was much better than what the RV dealer offered us.  I hope that we never have to use the extended warranty, but if we do, I am certain that the folks at Wholesale Warranties will be easy to work with.  We can depend on them to be our guardian angel ...</review>

My associate Shannon Fitzgearl was excellent.  She followed up, kept in contact and was always pleasant and helpful.  This motorhome I just purchased was number 13 and I have had warranties on all of them.  Many of my experiences have been unpleasant, but I have a feeling this one will not be.  Thanks again, Shannon and Wholesale Warranties!  Bob<//Review>

We just purchased a four year warranty with Wholesale Warranties.  The entire process went smooth and the people were nice to work with.  From what I read, WW handles claims in a timely fashion and without any hassels.  Sad to say, I contacted WW late last year to get a quote.  My wife and I decided to roll the dice and not get the warranty.  Well the dice came up "snake eyes" when we had a major problem in April with our diesel engine.  Instead of paying the $200 deductable, we paid over $4000 for the repair.  We now have piece of mind.</Text>

Shannon rocked!! She was helpful, knowledgable & friendly. I had been searching for an extended warranty for awhile and after quite a bit of research had decided to go with another company, but had such difficulty having my phone calls and emails returned, I decided to go with Wholesale Warranties. I figure the last thing I want during a breakdown is to not be able to get assistance when needed. I know Wholesale Warranties is not the warranty company, but everyone I have talked to about these products, has told me the company you purchased the warranty from sometimes needs to get involved if there is a dispute. I purchased the "consequential damage" option as well as this will cover the repair of a covered part if the damage was caused by a non-covered part. Oh, and the best part:  The cost was almost half of what the dealer quoted us and covered many more potential issues. Thank you Shannon!!<//Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Wholesale Warranties and the Viking Protection Plan turned out to be a very beneficial investment.  I usually don't purchase extended service plans, but since we are full time RVers, I figured it would be good insurance in the event of a costly breakdown.  As it turns out, I was correct.

But first, I want to thank Wholesale Warranties, and our Warranty Specialist, Dennis Wacker, for their great service from the purchase of the plan, to filing a claim, to  cancelling the coverage when we traded in our RV.  Dennis was very easy to work with. He clearly explained all aspects of the Viking Protection Plan and walked me through the purchase.  Their rates are very competitive and the plan that I purchased was very comprehensive.

Earlier this year our Norcold frig quit working.  I called a RV refrigerator specialist to come out and take a look.  He determined that we needed a new cooling unit to the tune of $2300.  He contacted the administrator of the Viking Protection Plan to get approval for the repairs.  For whatever reason the repair guy was difficult to deal with and did not want to work with the plan administrator to provide the required information.  In the end, the plan administrator decided to just pay me directly for the repairs and let me deal with the repair guy.  I was very pleased with how the administrator handled the situation.

When we traded in our RV Wholesale Warranties again stepped in and handled the cancellation of the protection plan.  Not only did they plan pay $2200 for the repair of the frig, but we also received the unused prorated premium when we cancelled.

Thank you Wholesale Warranties.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

We had our Motorhome scheduled to be winterized and needed the Battery Charging Relay changed due to it's constant chattering. Dropped the unit off at the dealers and gave them a copy of my warranty. Got a call three days later all done. Wholesale Warranties (ProTeck) was contacted by the dealer, and everything taken care of with no need for my intervention. No hesitation or questioning of the repair or if it was needed. Great service.     Dana< /text>

I can't say enough good things about Shannon and the service I received.  I shopped around a lot before purchasing and Shannon provided the best and most relevant information to help me make a decision.<//Review>

<Date>1498300356187< /Date><text>from the outset buddy was very informative and he as well as the staff were very helpful in the purchase process (i am a motor home owner that has not owned for over thirty years and that long ago we never had warranties) if my first claim(which i hope never comes) works as well as my purchase it will be wonderful ..since my purchase i have had two warranty claims and wholesale warranty has handled those claims as per coverage.  it is never a good thing to have problems with your motor home but it is made more bearable with a good reputable warranty. we also had to be towed and rv road america (purchased thru wholesale warranty)towed the motor home and covered all the expense of the tow. i would not drive a motor home off the lot without a warranty and roadside coverage.</text><userid>100543100245711354433</userid>< name>

<Text>I had a very bad experience with this company. I can't even imagine that all of these 5 stars are genuine.  A month before our Rv was going to arrive we purchased an extended warranty from this company.We finished our transaction when our Rv arrived. A Month later we called as something in the RV was no longer working and we could not drive it to a dealer to fix. When I called the claims number I was given, they could not find us in the system.
I had to proove to them and send them a bunch of information for them to see we purchased a policy. I called the salesman to find out what was going on and he would not take my call. I called anyone I could in the company to ask them to help me with this and why they did not put our information in the system but  no one is ever available to answer the phone unless it is a saleman selling you a policy. Everything else goes  to voice mail.
This went on and my family and I were  stuck with not getting the repair needed to the RV. The only reply I received was from the owner after I left a message on his salesperson's Voice mail that we are done with this company and want our money back. The owner of the company never called to help us with the situation but was more of  a selfserving call. This company is not reliable and when you see a company that is all 5 stars all over the internet, I have now learned it is true good to be true.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Had a problem with my 10K Onan generator this April.  Went to the Cummins store in Kenly, NC where service had been completed in November 16.  Was informed that they no longer worked with 3rd party warranties.  I called WW and handled everything myself.  Could not have been a better experience..  If Cummins was half as good to deal with as WW, it would be wonderful.  Thanks so much!!!!!< /review>< Response>

<Text>Purchased Wholesale Warrantee about 14months ago and have had to use it on two occasions. One was with the slide controllers for all 3 slides failed and a awning for the entry door had broken during the opening process. The awning could not be repaired due to unavailable parts due to the age of the unit. Wholesale warrantee covered the replacement with a new awning. Having the Wholesale Warrantee ProTrec Diamond coverage has been a great investment. Wakely RV in Erie Pa handled the claims with no issues on both of these claims and they had mentioned to me how helpful they where in the claim process. We have recently retired and feel confident when we hit the road this summer that we are covered for any issues that may arise.<//Text><rate>5</rate></record>

< Review>
I recently purchased a warranty from wholesale warranty. I was disappointed that parliament coach in clearwater florida does not accept extended warranty's. that is where I get my coach serviced. at first they said yes but when I returned, they changed their policy. their reason was coaches with extended warranty's tie up a space and pay only a fraction of the cost. this was their experience. I do not know what warranty company they had issues with. so my first repair had to be paid out of pocket. I called cummings in orlando florida to possibly do any repairs if needed and asked if they would accept extended warranty's, they also will not. reason I was told is the coach ties up a bay waiting for approval. so at this point I can not review anything but being declined by 2 major repair facilities.
when repairs are needed its difficult to qualify a repair shop who accepts extended warranty's. I was told to drive to another facility. that's not so easy when coach is disabled and your stranded, you don't have that luxury.
maybe when issuing a policy attach a list of repair facilities who do honor their warranty. that would be much easier. this would save a ton of phone calls and aggravation.
I look forward to a more favorable review. could only give 3 stars cause I have not been able to use it yet.<//Review>

It's a great place to bring you family or go have a relaxing walk or bike ride. It's a great place to take your dogs to let them run. There is a playground for the kids and a picnic area to eat. Would recommend for some family time.👌< /review>

This park is beautiful.
Plenty parking.
Nice picnic areas.
Lot's of beautiful lawn.
Trees for shade.
A play area for the little ones.
A little side note.
One of the keepers told me that a Chinese cook brought cherry seeds from China (the Bing cherry) and that's why the area is called Cherry Land.< /review>

Love this park. Only reason why I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because they don't allow dogs.</Review>

Has a BBQ area. Has bathrooms. Lots of beautiful flowers in the rose garden. Nice kids area. I went early in the morning and there were several people by the kids playground smoking marijuana and cigarettes. Not cool to do when children are there to play.<//Text>

I live in Washington state, but went to this park when i was 12 years old 27 years ago! It's always stood out in my mind as this beautiful park, the last place I was able to be alone with my daddy before he passed. The white mansion, It stood out in my mind for 27 YEARS, and it looks to be just as beautiful today. So this is a tribute to my daddy's memory and the longevity of this beautiful park. I miss you Daddy. R.I.P<//review>

<text>I've been to this park in the past and thought it was nice, but this evening I found out just how beautiful Meek Park really is. I wanted to walk and stay close to home so Meek Park it was. Many paths to choose from. The scenery is is wonderful, beautiful large trees,  many rose bushes in bloom. The park is well kept. Not one piece of garbage on the lawns, the children's play area very clean. It was very heart warming to see mom's and dad's playing soccer with their children! I smiled many times while walking.  2 thumbs up!</text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x808f91bb5000648d:0x68a5c7910d4d3c5f</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Meek estate park Hayward CA....
Centers around the Meek Mansion/house.
A part of Alameda County..... in the now City of Hayward but known as the "Cherry Land District" in the early 1900's.
Well known for its vast acreage of Cherry and Apricot orchards of that era.

The Meek family were very prominent land owners in the Cherry Land area hence the park name.
Parts of the park/house can be "rented" for Weddings and Gatherings.
The "HARD" park district runs and maintains this park.. and that means a very clean and very well maintained park.
Check out this Piece of Hayward CA History.<//review>

My kids really enjoy this park. Although it could be better if there were basketball courts. The park has a lot of shade areas if you don't like to be in the sun too much.  Great trails to walk or for kids to ride bikes and adults to still be able to see them. It also has play structures, a picknic area with tables and benches, reasonably clean restrooms, ample parking and most importantly the tire swing!!< /review>

<Review>A very cute park with a large play area for kids. The play structure is even styled to match the old mansion. The gardens are beautiful and well maintained and there's lots of space for a kid to ride a bike around. It would also be a great venue for a wedding. There's a beautiful gazebo and a large lawn area for guests. There are also fun historic facts on plaques. Did you know this location was possibly the origin of bing cherries? Lots of other cute facts too!</Review><Rate>5<//Rate><date>1506236363423<//date><gmap_id>0x808f91bb5000648d:0x68a5c7910d4d3c5f</gmap_id>< userid>

Amazing historic House and outbuildings. Beautiful grounds and a play structure for a fun afternoon. The Meek House offers several kinds of tours and they are well worth the fee.  The money going to the ongoing restoration f the home.<//review>

<review>Nice park. Has a New Orleans vibe to it. There's a garden, fountain, an old house (I think) to look at (from the outside), several trees, benches, space to walk, and two playgrounds. No dogs allowed  but definitely worth coming to.<//review>< gmap_id>

<review>A very beautiful, picturesque place to visit, with an open, grassy field, tall trees, garden, a fountain, a mansion.  There's also other amenities such as a childrens playground, picnic benches and tables, grilling area...  Seems like a perfect place for an outdoor wedding or just to spend time there with your family and friends.< /review>< Pics>

Meeks Park is our favorite place to walk, picnic, see friends, take our grandkids, and enjoy pretty scenery. We go often because we can walk the path beside Butternut Creek and stay where it’s level or walk all the way around the trail, which includes hills, if we’re feeling spunky. There are fields for sports and also fields for a game of frisbee or touch football.</Text>

This park is ultra serene with flowers and fountains and gazebos...you can sit on a bench or take a long walk...definitely go, great for parents with young kids to play on play structures or to bike with the family.</Text>
