< Review>
Good food for the free service I recommend this to you you you have any other questions or any other options that you have to go back here again today and the order is not much longer as it was a little while but it wasn’t worth the bill that I was looking at the other place in my Florida and the other day that was a little while I had got to my new chicken sandwich with my family to eat<//Review>

This place is great every time. I highly suggest you try the pita chips and dip.  This place is also great, because while most Irvine shops close at 8, this place is open til 10!< /text>

<text>Brother picked up the food from here for dinner. So I didn't know why to expect.  Strictly reviewing the food, it's not bad.  We got the party platter with chicken and beef shwarma, with fries and basmati rice. ($35). We also ordered a chicken kabob plate ($13) with pita, Cesar salad and basmati rice. Extra pita pita bread about $.75 per order and baklava about $5.

All the flavors were on point, but the meats this batch was just a tad dry. Fries were a bit overcooked as well, but I'm sure if it was due to the container and the time from pick up to delivery.  The garlic sauce was excellent, creamy with bold garlic flavor and they gave plenty of it.

Personally, I feel the food would be much better when eaten fresh off the grill and not with the travel time.  Or  maybe if some steam was allowed to escape from the container so food doesn't continue to cook. Who knows?

I would return here because it's convenient and give it one more try.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0e8OJAvdf0jdI1jONu2aBLJdkB4j7YCie7548=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2tG21BIvnAe7lQoaZoRmKFdoCr1PUKNEDSqK3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuyYGXfyJcU2O7YsfbrkN6maLpfH06p6IzTLE9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM39hoR5XL6oV4BQjjI5xfo2vvDxZM3D3Tvmn9y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipND3HypjcztThHfcAQJRV5aMu2BJHrSvDCFSjfN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJjBCwLX7y5_KYz0ttlTwVlQEGb1OePD1p3Wfr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

My boyfriend and I heard great things about Dave's but we had our doubts since we've had some pretty great hot chicken sandwiches. However, it's safe to say we were mind-blown!</review>< Pictures>

The Street Cart Doner is my favorite here plus the happy hour house wine. Prices are reasonable and parking available in the back. I've been to the DTLA location several times but my first time in the Studio City location did not disappoint. I came here on a Saturday at around 6pm and noticed this place started really filling up closer to 7.< /review>

Food was... okay. Definitely did not live up to the price. I got the chicken shwarma plate. Chicken was dry (probably sitting around which is why I got it so fast). I would rather go to Blue Mediterranean Café.< /Text>

The mummy burger is an explosion of flavor. They have the best fries in The Square. Can sometimes take awhile but they are often busy for a good reason. Good Gyros! Go and check them out today a!</text>

Food is good but overpriced. Customer service skills leave much to be desired. It is a busy food court during weekday lunch time. The buzzer they provided did not work. I enjoyed my beef wrap but was still hungry because the meal combo is $3.99 extra = not worth it.< /text>

Although the staff was really friendly and helpful, I was not impressed with my food. The chicken shawarma was extremely dry and lacked flavor. To be fair though, it was my first time ever eating Mediterranean food, maybe it’s supposed to be dry and flavorless...<//Text>

Very good lunch value for the area. Great quality. I would give 5 stars for less Rice, and more Chicken and Tabbouli. But they already set the bar high here, so I'm admittedly being picky.< /Review>

They have a section of Mediterranean inspired menu items including vegetarian options. I had the chicken kebab bowl with basmati rice. It was tasty and not too expensive.<//Text>

<text>I work around the area so I dropped by to grab some lunch and this was a newly opened place so I thought Id give it a try. I'm usually a fan of Mediterranean food and this place was no exception I ordered the ultimate beef shawarma. The place was packed but that's expected since it opened so recently but the food was great nice and hot the pita was soft and the meat was tender and tasted freshly cooked I'm a fan and will be returning along with friends to try more of there menu the owner is a really friendly person and you can tell he values his customers he recommended the mummy burger so that's what I'm hoping to try next.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1549080754469, 'text': 'thanks Please come visit our Sister Restaurant Mediterrania Gardens 320 N Pacific cost Highway Laguna Beach'}</Resp><GmapID>0x80dcdeeb483c0603:0x5d8e05a6cf51fae8<//GmapID></record>

Haven’t been able to try their food, but really disatisfied with how they conduct business. We ordered food, online, on Labor Day after a long day of traveling. Their website did not state that they were closed, and our order went through. When we went to pick up our food, the restaurant was closed (because of Labor Day.) We have called 4 separate times, and even tried contacting their online ordering service. We actually stopped into the location today, and were told they can’t refund us because they can also not get in contact with the service that THEY chose to use for online ordering. I have left my name and number with this restaurant multiple times, and have yet to receive a call back from a manager or owner. Will never eat here, as this has now become a legal matter and we are so upset.< /review>

Excellent falafel wrap and I also love their fries. Reasonable prices, just be prepared to wait 5-10 minutes for your food. It's not McDonald's. :P< /text>

Asked the manager to refund the difference and she said the menu prices are wrong, and she would not refund me anything.

Salad did not taste very good, and was really small. Have not eaten here since, and won't ever visit them again.<//Review><user_id>115366979078636415668< /user_id><Gmap_id>0x80dcdeeb483c0603:0x5d8e05a6cf51fae8</Gmap_id>< pictures>

Pretty good option for lunch in this plaza. I particularly like the chicken shwarma here, though I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu really. It isn't the greatest gourmet Mediterranean food ever but for a quick, tasty and (relatively) healthy lunch you could do much worse.<//Text>

Very traditional and old school Italian restaurant.   Their flavors and dishes don't really appeal to me since they use too many sauces and way too much salt for me but my 80+ yo mother seems to enjoy their food.  Definitely an institution in Menlo Park with their regulars!< /text>

First time here, had a great time. Great atmosphere, food, and have a good wine selection. I would definitely be returning. The service was okay, it could have been a little better.</Review>

Throwback to how Italian food used to be (and should still be). Been visiting this restaurant for nearly 10 years now. Same wait staff since my first visit. All their pasta is made in house and it shows. The best gnocchi I've probably ever had. Full gamet of varietals and price points on their wine list. Can't recommend this place highly enough. One visit and you'll be be scheduling your next visit to try everything on the menu.< /Review>

<text>The meal is quite spot on every time you go. The food is excellent and never disappoints. However sometimes it's obvious there aren't enough servers or there are too many people in the restaurant. The service will slow quickly at the start of the evening and never fully catch up. Sometimes an item or two will be forgotten after you've asked. But otherwise it's friendly, it's warm, it's clearly a spot where people love to return.<//text>< Pics>

<review>Amazing! The food was so good! The owner used to own capellini  on san mateo, and there is a lot of carry over. Best caesar salad, best calamari, and the main dish, for me, the Gamberomi al Limon is the best prawn dish I've ever had. The sauce is amazing! I don't usually gush over restaurants, but this is the exception. Everything is fantastic! Save room for dessert and get gelato!< /review></record>

<review>Very good, the food and service was exceptional. My wife had the shrimp and I had the scallops, both cooked to perfection. For dessert I had the mouse, It was too good to share. The only downside is that it is at a price point only for special occasions.<//review></record></dataset><record>

This place is incredible!   Ate here for a business dinner, the food and service were outstanding!!!     The namesake - Carpaccio was amazing and like none I've had elsewhere!    Keep up the great work.</Review>

New favorite Italian restaurant.  The salad, the polenta with the veal reduction, and the homemade noodles with mushroom were all devine.  Good choices of wines, whiskeys and dessert wines as well.< /Review>

The food is mediocre at best, and prices steep. Ambience is screaming for an uplift. Service is the saving grace, very friendly staff and attentive. Mostly seems to cater to older crowd.< /review>

<Response>None< /Response><Text>Food was below average: lacked salt in pasta dishes and the free bread was cold. When asked for more bread, it came back burnt and the inside was still cold. Service was okay: friendly servers and staff but took a lot of time. On top of all that, the food was ridiculously overpriced at $112 for four people and three dishes.<//Text>< name>

<Review>Came here late on a Tuesday night for dinner when the restaurant wasn't very crowded. Service was quick and the food was decent but I was shocked by the prices. I guess you are paying extra for the service and atmosphere.  Not the best place if you want value for food quality.

My boyfriend and I shared the Linguine Alle Vongole ("rosso" tomatoes, clams & garlic) and the housemade Pappardelle with red sauce and shitake mushrooms.  I thought both dishes were just okay--I did like the parpardelle texture but the shitake mushrooms were a bit of a strange combo.<//Review>< userid>

<Text>(Translated by Google) If you are looking for a restaurant where you eat good Italian cuisine, this place is not for you. The name of the place, the name of the dishes and some prints on the walls are Italian. The rest is just a faded memory, of Italian style adapted to the right place. Super seasoned dishes where flavors clash with each other to emerge. I hotel tasted a carpaccio to which they added mustard and a plate of penne that had everything in it. Anyway the staff are friendly and welcoming and whoever had the late hours despite the (for them). By the way I recommend, do not go here, as in no other restaurant in the area after 20.00 here at 21.00 they all close.

Se cerchi un ristorante dove si mangia una buona cucina italiana, questo posto non fa per te. Di italiano c'è il nome del locale, quello dei piatti e qualche stampa alle pareti. Il resto è solo una memoria sbiadita, di italianità adattata al giusto locali. Pietanze super condite dove i sapori fanno a pugni tra di loro per emergere. Io hotel assaggiato un carpaccio al quale hanno aggiunto la senape e un piatto di penne che aveva dentro di tutto . Comunque il personale è gentile e accogliente e chi ha avuto malgrado l'orario tardo ( per loro). A proposito mi raccomando, non recatevi qui, come in nessun altro ristorante della zona dopo le 20.00 qui alle 21.00 chiudono tutti.< /Text><gmap_id>0x808fa4b00470a663:0x8e4ee9a0052fb78b</gmap_id>< UserId.>

Extremely well organized and efficient. Prescreening was very helpful. With no appointment was in an out of there in 30 minutes for a Real ID Drivers license and new photo!
That's has to be a record!!
Arrived on a Friday at opening time.</review>

Ralphs is one of my two favorite places to shop. We have been coming to the same store, on 17th and Tustin, for 15 years. We have watched people come and go, but all our favorite checkers are still there. Everyone makes you feel like family, they ask about you and what's going on, and really make you feel valued as a customer. It's a great store and has everything you need. ❤< /text>

<review>Everyone here is very nice. The deli & the bakery is good. I usually go in the evening when most people are getting off work, but the lines are decent. I like to go to this Ralph's.</review>< Pictures>

<review>Usually great but tonight I parked next to the right entrance and was in the store for 10 min to find that they closed the exit that I had parked next to. So I had to walk all the way around. This is trash management in my opinion<//review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Everything in my order tasted nasty. The delivery driver forgot my two liter and had a crazy attitude. I ordered one large and one small with some bread twists and two liter. Total came to $54. When I checked my account they charged me an additional $10. Who does that? Save your money. Don’t eat here.<//Review><Name>Dee Boyd< /Name></record>

Perfect! We ordered online and did pickup.  I ordered wings and double pepperoni. Not a single complaint.  The pizza was phenomenal and the wings just as delicious.  And both piping hot. Great service and friendly and happy staff.  Thank you for a fantastic meal. ♡☆<//review>

This place is always empty, (high prices and no promotions makes it a wasteland in there) but even then we want to order pizza at 8:20pm they say they can’t because they are closed. They close at 9pm and I’m shook they refuse money when they are literally always empty..... Morro bay dominos is eating them up like candy, even the small independent pizza places in Morro bay stay open later than 8:20pm, such a joke 😂😂😂 roundtable do better< /review>

The pizza is really good here. The service could have been s little better. They close at 10 and we arrived at 9:25. You could tell the guy behind the counter didn't want us there. Maybe he was having a bad day. But the pizza and the beer were great. Love this place. Had a great atmosphere and has a few games for the kids.<//text>

<Review>Super friendly staff and delicious food.  I'm not giving five stars because the salad bar could use a serious and much needed overhaul and the environment isn't such of your typical Round Table Pizza.

I've gone to RoundTable since I was a kid and the pizza has always taste the same...something I admire in a company as it shows originality. The price could be a little better but you get what you pay for! The Manager at this particular RoundTable was very customer oriented and I would eat here again in the future!< /review>

They have a few TV's always going so you can watch sports or whatever you like. And there is also a small arcade for the kids or anyone for that matter. It's my favorite pizza place around. 5 stars</Text><gmapID>0x80ece176b24a66a5:0xadc2e9a2530c26ce</gmapID><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><UserId.>115458684407300547239</UserId.></record>

<review>Spent $85 dollars on pizza. Had to pay for ranch. $7 salad that's without dressing. Yes, they charge you to add dressing to your salad that you pay for. As if that isn't bad enough they give you a tiny salad plate and you're allowed 1 trip to the salad bar.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

one of the best pizza net in the usa. but, very expensive. for a pizza for 2 persons you pay 25$ and thats a lot of money.
my fav pizza is blaze, pizza for 2 persons cost 11 $ AND ITS THE BEST AND CHEAPER.

I came here and ordered a king Arthur supreme with extras, first off there large isn't a large it's a lot smaller, I know  this because I went to another Round Table the day befreb and ordered a large,  so that's the first rip off. Then I ordered extra garlic and extra linguicia and you couldn't even see the garlic barley at all and then there was only abuta 4  slices of pizza that had 2 pieces at most of linguicia on it. Paid extra and got a small pizza with barely any toppings and was ripped off. Would not recommend at all. If you want good pizza and your monies worth don't go here.< /Review>

Ordered 3 pizzas for a party online and was told it would be ready in 35 minutes. Showed up to pick them up right on time and was told they were still cooking. Waited another 15 minutes and asked how they were coming and was told they were 20 minutes deep still on the wait. When I asked why it was taking so long I was told sorry, we're running out of everything today and they weren't even made yet much less still cooking. Waited 80 minutes for the pizzas and they couldn't have cared less. Spent $91.78 for three pizzas and received terrible service. Never again.< /review>

Everyone was so sweet! My hygienist, Andrea, was also super friendly and really personable too! Dr Audrey Yoon is equally as great. She took her time in explaining my treatment options. All around great office and even better staff! Highly recommend!< /Review>

I have always been terrified of the dentist, even as a grown woman, but my experience with Dr Audrey Yoon was amazing. They were patient and had conversation skills that held your attention instead of being afraid. I had no pain with either of my 2 root canals. Thank you for the great care.</review>

Dr. Hu and Dr. Yoon are great orthodontists and it is very obvious how much they care for their patients.

The location is family-friendly and centrally located near the 91, 605 and 105 freeways.

The bathroom is very clean and the whole place is classy and feels like home.

Cristina, the office manager and her staff are courteous and very professional and they go out of their way to make you feel welcome.

I highly recommend The Brace Place to all my friends and family. Give them a chance and I think you will too.

Today was my first visit! I never felt so good about trying someone new. The staff and dentist were so welcoming, friendly and warm! Everything was explained to me with my X-rays on a TV screen in front of me. Thanks to a friend of mine that recommended them to me! I would suggest if you are looking for a new dentist you give them a try. You won’t be disappointed.</text>

Dr Audrey did a great job with my cleaning and filling. They made sure I was comfortable and were so efficient. I came in for my lunch break and finished with time to spare and I feel great! Thank you Kim for being so nice and knowledgeable and thank you Dr Audrey for taking good and skillful care of my teeth.

<review>I got braces twice because first round results relapsed. I was anxious when I get braces 2nd time in this office.  Dr. Yoon is very very famous orthodontist and well respected from other dentists, orthodontist and doctors all over the world. My treatment went well very efficient.  Everyone in this office here was very supportive and did everything they could to ease that. It was a positive experience all around. I really appreciate all the care and concern that they provided for my daughter. Thank you so much to the staff here! I'm so appreciative.< /review>< pics>

Outstanding people I had a true dental emergency and called offices all over the only office to understand my emergency and get me in as soon as possible. Dr Audrey treated me like family.Extracted a tooth on a day when Dr Audrey wasn't even working, but knew the severity of it and treated me like family. practice and what do! Great work!< /Text>

<review>Dr Audrey Yoon is the best orthodontist you will ever find. His attention to detail is impeccable and his truly caring nature makes you feel so good as a patient. Before I had treatment I was embarrassed by how my teeth looked and didn’t like to smile. Now I’m confident in showing off my beautiful smile every day. He has changed my life and I can recommend him highly. Thank you again!<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Okay I don't know how she does it, but Morgan has the lightest touch to where you don't know she's even working inside your mouth and yet my teeth are so clean!  I think she must be related to the tooth fairy. Dr Audrey Yoon is very talented educated and personal too great dental practice.< /Review>

It’s my favorite appointment of the year to get my teeth cleaned and see the dentist. I met Dr Audrey Yoon today and he was incredibly reassuring about my dental needs. Meg has been my hygienist for over 5 years and I will never go to another clinic unless she takes me with her. The staff are amazing.</Review>

Dr. Yoon is a super caring and thorough orthodontist!  We are referred to her by a friend dentist who's son had his ortho done by Dr. Audrey Yoon, and I figured since she was so good with kids, she would be good with my husband, who can be a little bit of a baby with dentists. I enjoy going with my husband to his appointments since they always have movies playing in the waiting room, and the staff is always very nice and inviting. I'm glad that I chose Dr. Audrey Yoon office, especially since I'll be there a lot for the next two years during my husband's treatment!<//Review>

< Review>
Dr Audrey Yoon is the best of the best orthodontists. I was referred from my cousin who is also a famous dentist in New York and he told I need to see only Dr Audrey Yoon, nobody else, because my case  is so complicated and I also really concerned about esthetics.
Dr Audrey Yoon is very famous among physicians and dentists,  in her clinic, lots of patients are actually physicians, I even met my plastic surgeon, he got treated his smile by Dr Yoon!
When I met her first time during consultation ,she explained very well  complicated concepts and went over  treatment options from noninvasive to invasive one with a big smile.  You can feel she really genuinely concerns about your overall health and beauty.
I'm so glad I got treatment done by Dr Yoon.  Super satisfied.< /Review>

I remove a star for every major issue I encounter with a business. I've never been to the facility myself but I found it as a place for my husband to take our 2 boys for treatment. The first issue is being able to get through. It was so hard to do which should've been a sign but I admit I chose to ignore it and was able to get through after 12 attempts of getting the busy signal (they really need to have additional lines for business). We scheduled their exams and was provided treatment suggestions for the both of them. Now I will say this, Dr. Audrey, I will be grateful for confirming my suspicion of my youngest son having problems with breathing and putting a name to that. He's since had a successful tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy and doing better than ever thanks to your referral. However, the dental work that both of my boys needed were supposed to be requested with the dental insurance company so we can anticipate our share of cost and set everything up for the work to be done. And that was the 2nd issue. After countless times of reaching out to the office about scheduling and determining what our cost share would be, each time the staff says the same thing: "um we haven't reached out yet, do you want to just have it done and then we tell you how much it'll cost in the form of a bill or do you want to reschedule?" Excuse me? Yeah let me just have the services done so you can send me a huge bill and demand it in full or by a certain date or it'll go to collections. What if it's a ridiculous amount and I'd rather save to have it paid in full prior to having it done? And reschedule? Yeah cause I have so many dates available that I can just easily call off from work. I mean it's unbelievable how inconsiderate they are!! I just thank God we've found a place that's better, easier to work with and get through on the first try. I do NOT recommend this place, it will truly be a waste of your time. Remember your dental insurance only covers for the first exam of the year. Make sure it's with a dental office that takes your treatment seriously and will follow up with you!< /Text>

Friendly environment. Kids get treated well and don't leave scared. They use laughing gas to ease the kids as anxiety. Would recommend this place.< /text>

<text>Dr. Yoon is a skilled orthodontist. She approaches her patients with professionalism, knowledge, and kindness. I feel like I could trust her with anything. The entire staff is very friendly and efficient - I cannot say enough nice things about them. I had my braces for about 2 years and my teeth have never looked so perfect before. All my thanks to Dr. Yoon and her amazing staff!< /text></record>

<text>This place is absolutely terrible, i came here three years ago. They let an intern fill my childs cavities. They did not numb her while drilling and the same day she got her teeth filled, they were sensitive to sweet things. A week later i call the building and the intern had been fired. Her teeth are still messed up since our insurance only covers places like this.< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Dr Yoon is the sweetest most loving Dr around. I have been coming to her for a few years now and Whenever I have an appt I never have to wait long. Her waiting area is so comfy, cozy and inviting and she offers the best prices around. I went to a few consultation before choosing Dr Yoon and no one beat her prices or had the great spirit that she has always smiling. You will not be disappointed coming here.<//Review>

She has genuinely caring personality and always greets you with cheerful voices and listen to your concerns and answers all. The friendly staff, and professionalism (Not to mention patience) of Dr. Yoon has been great! Never have to wait, and even "squeezes" us in slots when changes of appointments need to be made! They work with you to find a payment plan that will fit your budget and are flexible in their scheduling.  It feels like the patient's care and convenience are the office's top priority.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<time>1396463162588< /time><text>Dr. Audrey Yoon is the best orthodontist I've found. She has two locations in LA county.  I started my treatments from LA and transferred to this location. She is so dedicated to each patient, and really takes the time to manage all dental issues, including coordinating with my other doctors, since I had a big issue with my jaw ( I had a cyst inside bone). I like how thorough and considerate she is, going above and beyond to ensure optimal dental health, even case management for cross-discipline issues. I am so grateful that I went with her for my orthodontia care. She did a truly great job, and was always friendly, professional, and helpful. I would recommend this office to anyone seeking care or a consultation.< /text>< rating>

Dr Yoon is the sweetest, knowledgeable, competent orthodontist.  She greets always with a big smile and listen to your concerns.  She doesn't not treat just teeth, she looks at people as a whole concerning of airway, growth and development of facial bone and aesthetics. She is the Simply the best.< /Review>

My kids are terrified of the dentist so i decided to try the brace place and it was the best decision I had made . My youngest needed two feelings and two extractions so you can image how  terrified I was . As soon as I stepped foot in the office I knew it was going to go well. The girls in the front were so welcoming and helped my son relax . the procedure went well my son did great and he isn't even scared to go back .... thank you guys so much I will never go anywhere else .

<Review>I love this place!!! I have 2 boys which I took to another Dentist (Dr. fishman)  and right away he wanted to put my youngest my4yr old to sleep to do some work on him, which I wasn't allowed in the room so that was a defenitly a NO for me.. Here at the Brace place & Dentistry they are so caring and patient with my sons and I love that. They did some work on my 4yr old with Laughing gas be has he is a but active but I was allowed in the room and that made me feel 1000 times better.< /Review>< Name>

i am a new patient of dr.yoons and so far i am very pleased with her work and her enthusiasm. i decided to go with the invisalign because she happens to be one of the top providers for it. my overall thoughts of the office is its very well kept, she has a great staff who are also really helpful and friendly. i would definitely recommend this office to my friends and family.< /review>

I hate this place . They take so long , I waited 2 hours for them to attend me and I had an appointment scheduled with them. Not only that but to pick up my retainers I had to wait 2 hours. For me it seems disorganized ..</Review>

Had the best experience here. They patched my tire in no time for very little and also made sure I had air in my other tires. They put the spare back and made sure everything was in order. Very sweet owners.</text>

< Review>
Stopped in here to have a tire with a huge nail repaired. Process was quick and easy. They do tire repair correctly with an internal patch instead of a plug like other places, it take a bit longer and is more labor intensive but it is a much better repair.< /Review>

<text>Wow I have been coming to my tire guy xalo for some years now, because he really takes care of my range Rover for tires. And so if anyone needs tires for any vehicle contact my friend Xalo the owner. And soon he will be doing brakes  he is such a nice guy I want him to have more business so everyone pass it along thank you. Danke< /text><Date>1536007018845<//Date><Resp>None< /Resp>< Rating>

Jorge found the nail that was causing the leak in 6 seconds. Patched it up and had me back on the road in minutes. I'll be coming here for all my tire needs in the future.</Text>

<review>Friendly and quick, considering we were the only ones there.  Service was very friendly and they were a great help figuring out what we wanted. Mint chip was my wife's choice and I had s'mores. Both were very tasty and both were roses. Could have used more fluff but figured that was to see the rose better. Aces anyway. Would recommend for the show that is put on in the process of making ice cream. Never had nitrogen ice cream before, but will start seeking it out

Creamy, creamy, creamy.

Thanks for the introduction. 👍😁🤠<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyk6Mv2wAdMiqS4gnCWc0GpFjCFDJ9eIJTIk-O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0kuWG-WxoWL8OmCLhRrJvGEZE2N-LOh5HG4pC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkiLVqFcIyKjPqNzwHRpRczq2kp7rBu_4ts3Xj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCYA56bJMOniR53Jmp8XDRszPMzm_mp06j53ai=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

<review>Honestly wasn't that impressed with the ice cream. But the theatrics and optical demonstration og nitrogen frozen churned ice cream is thrilling. As if little blast of sub zero nitrogen couldn't be mesmerizing...kudos on a brilliant idea. Overall the velvety smooth ice cream was splendid, however flavor was mundane and lack luster.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMte7CMMd9QB1Wm5vZywcikqsN4nPGBI9Q5pOLK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKoQJwqYpCLJcBfISIibbXiqjd8Lpk_kWD5wUE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0_rup9meRPXm5VXaDcMC9TNWLojVo3tJbdhcl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

<text>I was really skeptical about trying Cauldron because I had a bad experience with nitrogen ice cream @ a different shop in Monrovia but I'm so glad I gave this place a go.  I was a fan from the first taste.

I know that some people get thrown off by the texture of nitrogen ice cream because of how thick it can be but Cauldron was pretty smooth. I've tried several different flavors but Sun, Moon & Stars is hands-down my favorite.  It didn't take too long to make yet it was really cold.  Cold enough not to melt inside a hot, freshly made Hong Kong waffle (they call it their "puffle cone").

Service is okay.  There is only one bench to sit on inside with some table seating right outside the shop and plenty of public seating in the shared space of nice Asian plaza in which they're located.

Aesthetics: 4/5
Service: 3/5
Food: 4/5
Recommend: YES<//text>< pics>

I tried their Earl Grey Lavender with Churro Puffle cone. There were a couple of people ahead of us which made the wait turn into 15 minutes. It tasted good; the earl grey tea had a  lavender aroma to it while the honey swirl on top gave a slight sweetness to the creamy texture. The churro puffle was bleh. It's basically an egg waffle with cinnamon toast crunch sprinkled on it. The liquid nitrogen makes for a nice "bespoke" ice cream...but it takes too long and has limited flavors for me to return.</text>

Nice mint flavor, nice creamy texture but it melts fast!!! So start digging in right away!

The whole mix, stir and freeze before your eyes is fun. I wish they served it to us a bit more frozen, maybe a second longer of cold exposure.

I’ll be back to try the other flavors!<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8oEIDY41GYt8zGXZvu9qt887gCfu2bgxcMD9f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

I went there with my girlfriend before the grand opening. I actually ended up not getting anything because there was a group of maybe 5 people in front of us and they were waiting to be served. Everything was really slow. I know they might not be ready but for it to make us wait 10 minutes and not being able to serve us was unacceptable. At least acknowledge our existence by saying "Hello, Welcome, sorry but we will be right with you" we wouldn't have walked out without ordering. Perhaps one day I'll try again.</text>

<text>We came here for the first time and really enjoyed ourselves. Both of us ordered the puffle cones with our ice cream and that was a great choice. They're like a waffle with small circle puffs instead of cube holes. They come out warm, so you do have to be quick about eating your ice cream as a result, but it's worth it. We tried the Cauldron flavor and the Rose H2O flavor, both were tasty.</text>< pictures>

I have only been here one time for grand opening, I like it the egg puffle cones, they are actually very tasty and soft with a bit of crunch. I wouldn't have it all the time but the ice cream is hand made and they shape it as a flower for free.</review>

<Review>The hype of this place is high but the actual taste isn't that great. Cauldron's take on the Hong Kong egg waffle lacks in terms of taste. Sure, they have a lot of different flavors but it's not even close to how they're made in Hong Kong. It tastes stale and it's not crispy like how they're supposed to be. The price is ridiculous for desserts and I'd rather walk next door to summer rolls for a meal instead.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2dba915d0f925:0x11766a94f86a9fee<//Gmap_id></record>

< review>
Family and I went to their grand opening a month ago and ordered the Sun, Moon, and Stars ice cream with a red velvet puffle cone (essentially a Hong Kong egg waffle) and just a Family size (4 scoops) cup of the Earl Grey Lavender. Waiting for the ice cream wasn't long even though it's made to order. All of them were pretty good and I also like that they can make the ice cream into a rose shape! The only thing I didn't like was the fact that you could only get 1 flavor for the 4 scoops instead of individual flavors, but I understand that it's not pre-made and it'd take longer to make 4 different flavors. Also, it's pricey too but the ice cream is made with nitrogen, making it more creamy and denser, so probably that's why. Overall, a pretty solid ice cream place!<//review>

They fixed our order no problem, even upgraded to prime rib on the steak fajita. Good service and a quiet atmosphere, we really enjoyed celebrating our grandma's 95th birthday here!</Text>

The place was pretty empty so our server was attentive and very pleasant. All our dishes were good and came out quickly. I would try them again.<//Review>

Poor service, mediocre food, and VERY long wait for food.  We went for dinner (family of 4  with 2 adults, 2 children) on a weeknight.  The ONLY people there except the folks at the bar watching TV.  Took us 30 minutes to receive our appetizer (calamari) and then another 30 minutes to receive our dinner.  Our kids were FREEZING in their beautifully decorated large open dining area, which was anything but WARM or inviting.  1 1/2 hours after arriving, we finally left with a HUGE bill $75.00 for 2 adult meals and 2 children's meals.  Food wasn't worth the cost or the wait.</review>

We were very impressed with the food at Castle Rock.  My wife had the New York strip and I had the ribeye. the entire meal was excellent. I bet noisy in there the day we were there. There was some activity in the bar we were almost alone in the dining room with two other couples but the service was good and the food was great.<//Review>

Very disappointed!  Some long term Livermore friends advised that it used to be good there. The service was not friendly out going. The place was empty but our food took forever to arrive. Over 30 minutes. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this place at all!!<//review>

Nice little neighborhood base. Staff was nice and polite. Although the exterior of the building was very unique, the interior could use an upgrade. When you walk in, you'll notice the cheap tables and chairs probably bought at Costco.< /text>

We had a celebration of life ceremony there and we were not only pleased with the hospitality but we're genuinely treated with respect and courtesy during our time of bereavement. Their catering was top notch and the owner opened up the facility to accommodate to the size of our celebration.

Oh boy, was my experience here bad. We came with a party of 5, and were seated at the only table large enough to fit us all, at the very back of the restaurant. There was only one other party in the entire building, an old couple enjoying lunch. The only waitress in sight acted like it was her first day on the job. We ordered calamari as an appetizer, and after waiting an unnessecarily long amount of time, we recieved fish sticks and ranch. We complained to the waitress, and she came back with, "Oh, we have a new cook, he's still learning." At that point I was ready to leave, but the rest of my party wasn't. I ordered a simple cheeseburger thinking that they couldn't screw it up. The bun ended up being stale and burned, and the meat tasted like it was meant to be thrown away. We paid and walked out as quickly as possible.</review>

Had breakfast with my wife. Her waffle was cool and the butter ball was rock hard, straight from the refrigerator. I ordered eggs poached softly with my corned beef hash and home fries. The eggs were served well done. The home fries were greasy. Also it took a long time to receive our meals. After the meal we had difficulty getting the waitress's attention so we could pay the bill. We were not happy customers.</text>

They mixed up most of the orders and wouldn't being refills on drinks. One family member didn't even get their food. In the end they still charged us for it and they charged twice the tip. We will never be going back here again. Its not professional to have your employees holding their children in the kitchen and bar area.< /review>< GmapID>

Tuesday night 'Taco night': 50mins to get apps that were bad ( sent one back), then a slow taco... hardly prepared. We left and a forgotten phone was taken, 'could not be found'. Only 5mins later I discovered it in the bushes outside service entrance!! Thanks to iPhone lock/sound.</review>

< review>
I was hopeful due to all the high reviews of thos placr, and on approach it looked exactly like a placed my girlfriend and i would enjoy. For the most part it was ok in the beginning but the longer we stayed the mote dissapointed we became.

Service was mediocre, and after had found out we were being served by the manager it was a little more disappointing.

The bathrooms had not been serviced.

The atmosphere had a lot of potential. Thr place looks nice. But that was kind of ruined by the type of clientele they bring in. At least while we were there we had felt less like we were in a family restaurant and more like a dive bar with a couple of drunk patrons at the bar acting like this was just tbat, a bar, and not a place for someone to get a decent and quiet meal.

The food that we found edible was good. Nithing to write home about but not bad in any respect. Except that our order of chicken tenders was dangerously undercooked, so we had that taken off our meal which at least the manager was polite enough not to deny.

All in all i had high hopes from what we saw walking up, but on this day, it seemes that nothing was really worth the trip.

Bases on my experience I would not return, nor would suggest this location.< /review>

Can't judge the food because we were ignored so long we left.  When we told them why, they were unapologetic.  It felt dirty and had an interesting odor to it.<//Text>

Re; Saturday evening 6/17/17 - I have been going to Castle Rock Restaurant for a long time, mainly to listen and dance to the music of the fantastic duo band, Take Two. But also for the fantastic service of the waitress, Sonia, and the good Manhattans and great steak salad. The new management still kept the great steak salad, and Take Two remains terrific, but the new management let go the best waitress imaginable, Sonia, and despite the knowledge that a large crowd would be there last night for Take Two, they only had ONE waitress, the new and overwhelmed, Cynthia, and ONE bartender. We waited over an hour and a half before we could even place our drink and dinner order. If it wasn't for Take Two, we would have left. I sure hope they bring back Sonia, or we will eat and drink elsewhere  before coming for the band.
UPDATE 6/25/17 (Sunday evening) - Castle Rock had sufficient wait staff this time for the crowd that comes for the fabulous music of Take Two. They even had table cloths on all the tables. The Manhattans were fine. But unfortunately they really skimped on what used to be a fabulous steak salad. I will go back because of the band and the improved service. Really disappointed by the just OK steak salad (which used to be the best I ever had anywhere). Guess they also changed chefs.
UPDATE 7/22/17 (Saturday evening). OK. The management is listening. We returned for the once-a-month Saturday music of the really fun band, Take Two, and although the crowd was much less than last month (when the service was incredibly awful and inadequate),  at least there was  now adequate wait staff to service us in a timely manner. Nick, a now experienced waiter and his waiter-in-training, Tyler, did a good job. And the quality of the steak salad has come back. We will come back. :-)
UPDATE 7/23/17 (Sunday evening) - I was accosted on the dance floor and then threatened by the owner of the  Castle Rock building that if I didn't stop (I'm assuming someone identified me to her as the writer of these reviews) she would no longer host the band. This was after I had been served a warm Manhattan, which I was just going to let go.  Apparently the owner of the business, the restaurant and bar, was also present.  I later learned one of the owners berated another paying customer for going in search of her dinner, which was taking so long to be delivered. By the way, the only diners in the restaurant that I observed were the dancers, at Castle Rock solely because the band was there. Without the great band, Take Two, there would have been like 40 less dinners sold that evening. And by the way, the average age of us dancers is probably 72. I can't imagine what the owner of the building and the owner of the business were thinking when they berated their elderly customers.<//text>

<Review>The place itself is Nice, I cant believe that they still allow DJ Devastador play there as he has harrased many woman there including my wife. Really thats the type of people you allow at your establishment? He should be put to jail for "try to seducde" woman. Im not going back as long as hes on that list.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>This place is actually great to come here as it is pretty small yet it's priority is mainly snacks, candy, and of course liquor since it is a liquor market so that is pretty obvious. If you are looking to just get a quick snack and buy some junk food, chips, drinks, etc. This is the place to go and is a good place to go to. And it is very accessible place and is relatively easy to get into and can be easily seen from regular traffic.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>I whent the other day to buy a drink ,chips & lottery tickets.
the total of my bill was $6.02.
when the you pay with a ATM or DEBIT CARD.
They will charge you $2.00 dollars on your card, just because they want to.
They are a rip off.
POOR SERVICE
PRICES WAY TO HIGH

THIS PLACE DOES NOT GROOM POODLES. I have a Maltese-poodle mix, they wanted to charge extra for detangling (not matted hair, just regular hair that needs to be groomed) and said they cannot detangle and trim, that the only cut they could do for me is completely shave. They failed to tell me this information over the phone one week ago, when I told them the breed of my dog. Save some time, you’ll have better luck at Petco.<//Text>

<Text>I brought my 2 kitties in for the grooming (bath and nail cut) because our usual place didn't have availability for the next couple days. At first everything was fine, the front desk lady was friendly; however, once I picked them up I noticed they looked tired. They won't eat treats, not try to get out the the carrier once I opened it in the car!

* Our cats are little over 1 year old and usually hyper active!*

1). Their BEHAVIOR became VERY STRANGE after this grooming salon. First they went hiding under the couch (they never do that!) All they do is sleep, and the girl who is always jumpy and tries to run away once you pick her up has been sleeping in my arms for 2 hours now! I'm extremely worried that did they do to them during this damned grooming appointment!

2). Another unexplainable thing is the amount of hair shedding! After a bath and brush there shouldn't been nearly as much hair! (See the photos I posted)

3). The price is expensive $110 for 2 cats bath and nail cut (no hair cut). Petsmart charges exactly half the price

4). They didn't require us to show cats veterinarian records even though it was our first time at the place. The lady just asked if they had all the shots. That doesn't seem legal or safe since some people might be dishonest about this and your pet can catch something!

Rest assured this was out first and last time here.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM43jmyYxDaqvQPrRBqNKVVUmpMyAV6SZgAzoU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

I took my dog here to get his nails clipped. He seemed over-anxious when I picked him up and crying quite a bit. I had him groomed here before and there were no problems. Today, we just brought him here to do a quick clip, not the whole bath & (expensive) grooming and they seemed put off by the fact we didn’t want it all.  They cut one of his nails PAST the quik, making him bleed. They didn’t mention anything at all and gave me a hard time about running my credit card for any service under $20. I trust groomers to do the more difficult grooming that I don’t feel qualified to do, as you would ASSUME they are professionals. This is the farthest thing from it and I won’t be bringing my dog back here.< /Review>

<review>My dogs have been getting baths here almost monthly since they were 12 weeks old (they're now 7). They always look amazing and they love going here, I know this because they walk right in, no pulling, just strut right in with tails high and wagging.

<review>I been taking my dog here for a few years. They are pretty consistent . I always go early and my dog is ready by 10:00 or 11:00 on a busy day. They are reasonable priced and do great cuts. When I leave my dog , I know he is in good hands. My dog always leave them a tip on the floor.</review><gmapID>0x80c2b8e20578ac55:0xb7f374ee80742fa< /gmapID>< name>

Place looks dirty. And after the bath, half of the kitty’s nails were bleeding. Terrible experience. And they even ask for extra charge next time. Unfortunately, there will be no next time.< /Text>

<Name>Paulette Emerson</Name><date>1485293042912</date><rating>5< /rating><review>I have a long haired diva of a cat that suffers from urinary issues.  He's had surgery but his long fur causes him great pain when it grows into his urethra.  We thought a great solution is to shave his fur around his very sensitive area.  Vet concured.  Not only did this team do a fantastic job bathing and shaving our cat's sensitive area, they took extra care to do it right.  Chalmers came home cleaner and happier.  His mood was instantly lifted not having to deal with pain any more.  He now goes once a month and hasn't had an infection since.  Thank you guys for giving this little car happier days. Highly recommend this place for anyone with cats with attitude.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Pet Joy is the only place I take my miniature schnauzer to, even thou i have to drive 30 minutes 1 way to get to. I used to live closer to Pet Joy but since moved a way. I have tried to other shops in Hollywood but they just didn’t do a very good job with schnauzer cuts. hence driving all the way to Olympic and La Brea.

Pet Joy isn’t a very big shop, shop owner and staffs are very friendly and they treat your pet very well. Pricing wise its above average. But its the only spot i go to with my dog.

Usually there is a long wait time during weekend. (Shop is closed on Sunday)

I usually drop off my dog 8am and pick him up around 10-10:30 or so.</text>

I’m on my 3rd pet dog with Pet Joy!  I’ve been with them over 12 or 13 yrs.  My dogs (poodles and now a King Charles Cavalier) always look clean and beautiful when I pick them up.  The Staff is courteous and pleasant.  I have recommended Pet Joy to other Pet lovers.</Text>

<review>I used Montano orthodontist for my daughter a few years ago and her smile is beautiful. As an adult, I was Unsatisfied with my smile and decided to do something about it. There was no question where I’d be going. The staff are so professional and Dr. Montano and his team create the most beautiful smile in town!  The experience was wonderful and I’m more than satisfied with the results.< /review>< pictures>

My 12-year-old daughter and I were both recently patients of Dr. Montano and Dr. Wright. I had a great experience using Invisalign, and my daughter just recently had her braces removed. We are both extremely pleased with our results, and can't speak highly enough of the friendly and professional staff. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, and the staff always took the time to answer our many questions and concerns. Would highly recommend Montano Orthodontics!<//text>

Best Orthodontics in Kern County! Every Orthodontic in town wasn’t able to help me because of my jaw etc. but Montano said it was no problem! I got my braces off yesterday and I am so happy with my results! Not only that, the staff is very nice and caring.</Text>

I’m still smiling and I’m not even the one who had their braces removed. I would like to share my experience with everyone and say that I am so happy that I chose Montano Ortho. My daughter went in for care and came out extremely happier as we seen amazing results. Apart from that they always helped me throughout any questions or times needed to maintain the best treatment for my child. He provides very professional care and uses the best advanced care out there. The environment provided there is beyond amazing. You will not be disappointed. They are very detailed with helping your child if you are going in for children. They make sure to explain step by step care for them and provide parent with useful information as well and always. I hope I can come back in and choose a treatment for myself. Thank you so much Dr. Montano!! My daughters smile transformation is incredible! 5 stars for sure!<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Dr. Montano and his team are the best. I started my treatment with Dr. Montano right after I had a treatment and my braces off by a different orthodontist. Dr. Montano is seriously the best, he fixed all the mistakes the other orthodontics did to my teeth and bite and now I’m very satisfied with my smile thanks to his work.
The scheduling and appointments were smooth, I never had to wait long to be taken in and the staff was very friendly and professional. The place is very clean and well maintained.
I definitely recommend Dr. Montano!< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMC_s7abaCcHoEzVNcleJFXAFCqcV1nuSXIE_N2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

Dr. Montano and his staff have been awesome to work with over the last few years but even more so this last year during the pandemic. The office is always clean and has been updated with additional measures to protect all of the staff and patients.
Everyone in the office are very kind and always helpful.

<review>I just got my braces of 1 1/2 years off today, and the experience was great. The office is always very clean and even specially decorated, as well as the very kind staff and Orthodontists. I personally started with crowding and crooked teeth, but now my teeth are straight and beautifully aligned. Montano Elevated Orthodontics is always honest and love their jobs, so have no reason to rush, or ask for unnecessary payments/steps, and it is the place to trust. I also happened to finish with my braces journey half a year early, although that is just my experience. I was also kindly offered a free teeth whitening just for writing this review. 😆 My appointments were always out in the open center of the office, not feeling embarrassing at all but actually less serious and “enclosed”. Surely recommend! Love my new smile! 😁</review>< Pics>

Professional and courteous. Treatment was thoroughly explained at on-set and thereafter until treatment was completed. I could not have found a better orthodontist/office to take care of my son’s smile.</Review>

<review>I was doing a lot of research where to get my braces from and my coworker recommended I go see Mr. Montano. After getting my consultation and speaking to him I thought it was the best choice to get my braces with him. I got Invisalign instead of the traditional braces and after 14 months I can finally feel great about my smile. I thought the employers were very professional and friendly which made it very comfortable. I truly felt valued by them and they addressed any concerns or questions I had. I would highly recommend.< /review>< pictures>

Since dr cardell has left this place has not been the same. The doctor now needs assistance since he’s always busy and the wait time to see him is about 2-3 months. He often is out of the office, which means the entire office shuts down and no one receives work. I need to get out of my retainers so i can get additional work down like my crowns, bleaching etc but can’t since the wait currently is 2-3 months. I don’t understand why we have to wait so long. Maybe take less customers if you can’t handle the demand. Also be prepared if you’re even 10 minutes late, they will reschedule you 2 months out. Where is the customer service in that?! This has been an ongoing concern of mine. Also when doctor is out of office which is often, so is the office manager. Shouldn’t the office manager be present to assist with other matters? Why is a free get out of work card for everyone. I just don’t understand how this is a reflection of 5 star service and or treatment. Hopefully this concern brings up some policy changes.</text>

<username>Emily Payne< /username><text>We have just completed orthodontic treatment for FOUR children with Montano Elevated Orthodontics! My first two children had quite crooked teeth and spent several years each in braces. My next two had less crooked teeth and they were each in braces for just under two years. The staff is always friendly and helpful, and I was confident that my kids were receiving good care. They are all satisfied with their smiles! I would really, REALLY recommend wearing the given retainer every single night. My oldest child lost his and has never gotten it replaced, and his teeth have shifted quite a bit. It really makes a difference!< /text><Gmap_id>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377< /Gmap_id>< user>

Incredible results! I was highly skeptical that my teenage sons teeth could be straightened with 2 years of Invisalign. Unbelievable that they are flawlessly straight, perfect, like a miracle and our treatment even finished early! This office offers top notch, state of the art professionalism with life changing effects! Each appointment they had his package of Invisalign’s  ready to go, in order and organized! I never had to monitor him once and he was only 13 at the time.  Everything you need and nothing is impossible here!! Minimal office visits, convenient and short appointments, extremely organized, friendly staff. Highest recommendation!< /text>

Staff is very friendly and informative. I took off a star cause we had a few issued with equipment breaking immediately after we left the parkinglot from her appointment. Other then that I would say all in all we were happy with their service.<//Review>

<review>I had an excellent experience getting Invisalign treatment with Dr. Montano! He and his team have been extremely patient with me and never stopped encouraging me to get back on track when I fell behind. I especially appreciate the attentiveness they take to ensure patients' needs are met. Thank you for helping me enhance my smile! 😁</review>< Rate>

<Text>I had my braces on for 7 years when I was a child and Dr. Montano had been my orthodontist. I had a giant gap and needed quite a bit of work to fix my teeth. Unfortunately a few years ago my dog chewed up my retainer and I never got a new one. Over the last year I began to notice I was getting a gap in my front teeth and also had some spacing that I was unhappy with. I decided to go back to Montano Elevated Orthodontics and I’m so happy I did. It’s amazing the new technology they have compared to when I was kid. It was an easy process and I am so happy with how my smile turned out. I would highly recommend Montano Elevated Orthodontics for both children and adults.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Finally after many years with braces I got them off! I wanted to get braces because I was always nervous about my teeth. I didn’t think my smile was really pretty. But after I got them off I can’t stop smiling. I feel so pretty and happy. I decided to chose Dr Montano because I heard many good things about him and I trusted the reviews. I am very glad I did! The team and staff there were always so kind and I always felt comfortable there. Never once did I felt like an odd one out. They were extremely professional. Once you start going to this orthodontist you will be happy you didn’t choose another! My advice to others is make sure to wear your rubber bands and brush your teeth everyday. Also don’t be afraid of getting them. After you get them off, you will always feel good about your smile!< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

We had the best service, care and results for my son's braces.  The Dr. Montano was very informative, kind and funny.  He first saw our son every year to check on him to see when would be the right time to start his braces for best results.<//Text>

<Text>Today after 38 months of treatment I finally got my braces off. I am beyond grateful with the staff and Dr. Montano who made my smile possible. My biggest insecurity growing up was my smile. After a routine cleaning with my Dentist she referred me to Dr. Montano. I live in Wasco, Ca so it was a 35 min drive but well worth it these past 3 years. My experience with them has been one of the best. The staff are so friendly and make you feel comfortable and welcomed. I'm a 26 year old who is rocking her smile, I feel so confident and cant stop smiling.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZuOkuvWhB3Z3Gb9uoVJWxzeOlHzs7GjjEDG3B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377<//gmapID></record>

<review>I definitely regret not taking all of my children to Dr. Montano. I recently had my braces taken off and am so extatic with my beautiful smile. The results are amazing!!! My son started his treatment with another office and unfortunately, it was a very bad experience. After removing several teeth, we were told he needed additional teeth removed and that's where I turned to Montano. They did an incredible job and no additional teeth were removed. The staff is amazing and the doctors are very knowledgeable and walk you through every step of your journey. I definitely recommend him to everyone and will soon be taking my other children to start their treatment.<//review>< Name>

Extremely professional, friendly and overall outstanding orthodontia facility. Montano’s facility is equipped with state-of-the-art technology and the staff is very knowledgeable and well trained in their field of expertise.

I would highly recommend Montano for all orthodontic needs. The last 19 months with Invisaligns was an overall positive experience and finishing my treatment today was an absolute joy.

<Text>We chose Dr Montano because as a mother that worked for a general dentist for years I’ve personally seen the great smiles he has done for lots of other patients so it was a given that my child go to his office for braces. They came up with a plan and stayed on track the whole time, we are very happy with the results and will definitely return with our youngest child in a few years.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I pursued orthodontic treatment because I didn't like my smile. My teeth were crooked and bite was uneven. I chose Dr. Montano because of the good things I've heard through friends. I just got my braces taken off and I am extremely happy with the results! Their staff is so welcoming and makes sure their patient knows they are in good hands. I highly recommend coming to this orthodontist if you want your confidence in your smile back.< /Text>

<Text>Before I started my treatment, I was looking for traditional braces only. Once visiting Montano, I soon discovered that I could also get Invisalign, an option perfect for me! I do not regret getting my treatment here whatsoever! From the staff to Dr. Montano himself, everyone made me feel at home, and were all so incredibly kind. If anyone is looking for an orthodontist, Montano is the way to go! I don’t have a single regret!< /Text>< rate>

I came to Dr Montano for braces as a child. The experience was so great that 20 years later, I came back with my own child. He went through 2 and a half years with braces and in that time, I have ZERO complaints. He had a few things unexpected come up along the way (pokey wire, loose bracket) and I was always able to get him in same day for a quick repair. Dr Montano and Cardall all both amazing and their staff is just as good. I am so happy I went with them for my sons braces. Should any orthodontic needs ever come up again, I wouldn't go anywhere else. Highly, highly, highly recommend. Affordable, respectable, professional, knowledgeable, friendly and caring...they really are all of those things. Thank you Dr Montano!!!! We are forever grateful for the beautiful smiles you have created!</Review>

My sister got her braces from Montano. So I decided to go to Montano because it was close and they took good care of my teeth. Now that I have gotten my braces off I am so happy with my smile. I am so happy that I went to Montano they were all ways making sure that I was alright with my braces. You should get a water pick it helps a ton.

Dr. Montano was my orthodontist 20 years ago and it was a wonderful experience. So I knew I wanted to take my daughter there when it came time for her braces. She got them off this week and we are thrilled with the results of all the hard work from your professional staff.

<Review>My daughter wanted straighter teeth because she thought it wasn't symmetrical enough. She wasn't happy with her teeth and was always self conscious. We researched several orthodontists and decided that Montano elevated orthodontics was the best fit for us in terms of experience and cost.

She is more confident and is constantly smiling. She was treated with respect and kindness every time she went in. If you need an orthodontist Montano elevated orthodontics is a great choice.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We are from out of town and my son has braces unfortunately his bracket became loose and I couldn't find an orthodontics that could clip his bracket. I called Montano orthodontics and the receptionist Sarah was so polite and got me an appointment the same day. I really appreciate it. Melinda was so nice she clipped the bracket and made sure this bracket didn't poke him. This is a great orthodontics Thank you<//Text>

After 51 years of living with crooked teeth, my employer added adult ortho to our dental plan and it was time to correct. I was referred by my dentist to Montano Elevated Orthodontics. I am so glad they did. I never realized before the correction just HOW crooked and how much my teeth affected my appearance. After living with it all of my life I guess I just became accustomed to them. The office explained that they offered Invisaline at the same cost as traditional braces because they have so many patients and they pass their discount on to their clients. They also offer a convenient payment plan that worked for me. From the initial visit, to dealing with the front office staff, to my check-up appointments (which were spread out every several months, not every month) I found Montano's to be helpful, convenient, and perfectionists. My correction took 16 months. Much shorter than I would have anticipated. I highly recommend Montano's to ANYONE considering teeth straightening procedures. They are the best!</review>

The reason why I pursued orthodontic treatment was to fix my smile. Before I got my braces I never use to smile with my teeth and now I can't stop smiling and showing off my awesome new smile. The team here at Montano are really good. They answered all my questions that I had during my appointments and really easy staff to talk to. All around good place and don't regret getting my treatment here at all.<//Text>

Amazing staff and facility! The staff is always super friendly and helpful. My teeth before braces weren't the best but weren't the worst. I really wanted to go to a place were they would feel comfortable and this was the place! My smile now is amazing and it was all worth it. Some advice I would have to give is- wear your bands! And make sure you bring attention to any concerns you may have, do not be afraid to ask questions-- they will be more than happy to answer them!<//Text>

From personal experience I highly recommend montano orthodontics. I’ve been with them a little over two years and I can truthfully say it’s been a pleasure. They take their job seriously and always had me in and out in a timely manner. One of my favorite features was definitely the text message appointment reminders! My braces experience was 10/10 from start to finish!!< /review>

They really were.  ~ Dr Montano was recommended by my regular dentist and I’m so glad I choose him as my Orthodontist. He is very knowledgeable and skilled. Besides having an office that has every new technology for straightening teeth, he also has created a very positive and fun atmosphere for his patients and staff. His staff are very nice, but also professional. They really seem to stay on schedule. When I checked in, I was practically called back immediately!! I appreciated that, but more than that I always felt assured that my treatments were going well. Now, my bite is correct and my teeth are straight!! Thank you Dr Montano for your great sense of humor and a big thank you for my -now- beautiful smile !!< /text>< pics>

When I started my treatment care through Montano, I had just turned 19 so being an young adult this was my first big medical decision I made on my own with the help of my mom. Being super nervous and not knowing what questions to ask or even walking in I did not know what to expect, but with Montana’s team made it easy for me and they were through with me about what the upcoming months would entitle with them. They were very flexible especially since I needed to finished in a specific time frame and they were able to make that happen for me with no worry. My smile before wasn’t too bad in my opinion, but now after my treatment I truly see a difference. I never knew what I was missing before but now I know and I love my smile!</text>

<Text>I pursued orthodontic treatment for my overbite and uneven teeth. Before I came to Montano I would never smile with my teeth while taking pictures because of my teeth. My mom decided it was time to go to Dr. Montano, and I wouldn’t regret any second of it! Everyone there made me feel so comfortable and they are just the sweetest people ever! Now I feel really confident about my teeth and it feels good to have so many people comment on your beautiful smile! I really recommend Montano Elevated Orthodontics. I love my smile!< /Text>< pics>

<Review>I was becoming increasingly unhappy with my teeth as the front teeth were uneven and one front tooth was longer than the other.

I decided to go see Dr. Montano and I am so very glad I did.

I have had nothing short of the very best service from everyone in the office!

On December 18th, 2019, my braces were removed and I have been celebrating ever since!

I am so jazzed, I can’t stop smiling!

My teeth look better than I ever could have imagined, and I feel like a brand new person!

I have had the best time, and I am going to miss these wonderful people that have been so awesome!

Dr. Montano has been phenomenal in making my teeth look so fabulous and Virginia has been my girl from A-Z.

I have been able to have so much fun in the office and everyone has made me feel like part of the family.

I also want to thank Dr. Wright for helping along the way as well.

I would recommend Montano Elevated Orthodontics for all of your orthodontic needs!< /Review>< response>

In all honesty  I was very satisfied with the service I received. For every appointment I had not once did I wait more than 15 mins. As of today My braces were removed and I could not be anymore happy then I am today with my smile. They did such an amazing job with me that I was able to get my braces removed before my actual date.< /Text>

<Review>I got my braces on about 2 years ago and before I got them, my teeth were really crooked, I had a huge over bite, and my teeth were so bad overall. I grew tired of the way my teeth were, so I decided it was time for a change. Before my treatment, I felt really self-conscious about my smile/teeth and I would feel embarrassed when I would talk to people. I rarely liked to smile and my confidence was very low. After I decided it was time to fix my smile/teeth, I was searching for options until I came across Dr. Montano. As I was doing more research about his treatments, I  decided to go with him because the prices were affordable, I got many benefits, and him and his team were always very caring/gentle with my case. Now that my braces are gone, I feel like I can be able to smile more and talk to people without having to feel embarrassed or self-conscious. I don't have to worry about my teeth anymore because I have enough confidence to smile. I am in love with my teeth/smile now! My experience with Dr. Montano's team was absolutely enjoyable because they made the environment feel really friendly and they were always super careful, caring, and gentle when it came to my appointments. If anyone out there is thinking about getting braces, then I totally recommend you go to Dr. Montano simply because him and his team are the best! You won't regret it and you will be happy/amazed with the results!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< user_name>

I used to have really crooked teeth but after my two phases of braces my smile is perfect and straight!  Everybody was always really nice and they were fast with the appointments.  They were always enthusiastic about everything and they made it fun.  It was definitely not as scary as I thought it was going to be!< /review>

Might be the best office ever! Staff has always been very welcoming and pleasant. My son has seen both doctors and he has liked each one. He just got his braces off and his teeth are beautiful. If you have an issue with your braces the staff really gets you in quick. Give them a try.</review>

Before going to Montano, I was pretty insecure about my smile and I wanted to change that. My mom and I looked at many offices but in the end I chose this one, and I am so glad I did. It was definitely the best fit for me, I wouldn't have wanted to go through this process any other way. The environment put me at ease and the staff was always so welcoming and friendly.  After almost three years of having my braces on, I am thankful to say that I am happy with my smile! I definitely recommend going to Montano Elevated Orthodontics.</review>

The moment I stepped in I was immediately greeted by the front desk staff. They had me fill some paperwork since it was my first time there. Then this lady took x-rays of my teeth and pictures, after she showed me around and told me to feel at home. I definitely felt at home and the place is so professional and hygienic.<//review>

<Review>As an adult I always hated my teeth and wanted a pretty smile. I finally went in search of someone to fix them. I had no idea that who  I was recommended was not an orthodontist and wasted a lot of money and years and had to do them all over again this time I researched the best and found Dr Montano! He is phenomenal at what he does he is educated and knows his craft he has changed my life forever!! I now have a beautiful smile and given me confidence I never had before. I would recommend him to anyone that needs a knowledgeable orthodontist. He  meticulous and wants perfection I respect that so much.< /Review></record></dataset><record>
<userid>108386678111448310691<//userid><name>Sovie Cruz</name><time>1580269068577< /time><rating>5< /rating><Text>I pursued orthodontic treatment after I was in my 40’s  as I was experiencing much crowding which was hindering proper oral hygiene. My teeth before treatment were difficult to clean which could have lead to serious oral problems and disease. I was referred to by Dentist who felt I was a good candidate for Invisalign. I love my smile now but much more importantly my teeth are so much easier to clean. The Montano Team are all super nice and friendly. Advice: I’m not going to lie, you will experience some pain and discomfort from time to time. Avoid as much as possible not to touch the attachments or edges of trays with tongue as this will cause much pain. Be faithful to keep the trays in as much as possible, why prolong the pain. I felt orthodontic treatment was worth the cost and I would recommend  Montano Elevated Orthodontic.</Text>< pics>

<Text>I decided to get orthodontic treatment because I was very self conscious about my teeth. My teeth were not in good shape and I did not like to show my teeth. I was tired of hiding my smile from everyone so I talked to my parents about getting braces. The first place we went was Montano Elevated Orthodontics and we instantly knew we didn’t need to go anywhere else. The staff was super friendly and the overall environment was very welcoming. I was beyond excited to get braces because I knew I would finally get the smile I had been waiting for. I was excited for every orthodontist appointment because it was one step closer to having a beautiful smile. I had braces for 2 years and actually just got them off. I am so happy about the way my smile turned out and I couldn’t be more grateful for everyone at Montano Elevated Orthodontics. My advice for others is to go to Montano Elevated Orthodontics when thinking about getting braces because they truly are the best at creating Bakersfields most beautiful smiles. :)</Text><GmapID>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377< /GmapID><Rating>5< /Rating><user_id>114445316473458376274< /user_id>< user_name>

Both my kids have had braces with Dr. Montano and both times were flawless! The office staff was wonderful, wait time was never long, everything was explained up front so there were never any surprises! I absolutely recommend Dr. Montano and even though we’ve moved to LA they were always more than helpful with appointment times that worked with the two hour commute for appointments. Never a single issue and there’s even Keurig delicious coffee while you wait!<//Text>

We decided to take my daughter to Dr Montano & Cardall after learning she needed extensive work. My husbands sister had gone to him as a child & was very pleased with the work so we thought it would be in our best interest to have our daughter be seen by Dr. Montano. From the first visit to the very last and every one in between we were pleased and always had the assurance that we were in great hands. The staff & doctors are great & very knowledgeable in the most up to date orthodontic treatment. We love her results! Thank you Dr. Montano & Cardall! :)<//Text>

<Review>My experience with Dr. Montano Dr. Cardall and their staff has been amazing. From day one they all have been positive, encouraging, and remained patient and helpful through out my care. Their office is very welcoming and doesn't have your typical orthodontics environment. One of the many benefits of this office is that you could get a second opinion within the minute, seeing as their are two specialists working in the same place. If you are at all interested in getting braces I 100% recommend going to Montano & Cardall.</Review>< rating>

Best experience ever.  This was actually my second time having braces.  Let's say the first time was over 10 years ago, before I had my wisdom teeth removed through a not so great office.  Going through Montano & Cardall Orthodontics was a pleasant surprise.  Easy to schedule appointments, didn't have to wait more than 5 or 10 minutes before being called back to be seen.  The application of the braces themselves was amazing compared to what I had experienced elsewhere before, as well as the removal.  The staff is amazing and actually try to ensure you are comfortable and explain exactly what is going on.  I would like to thank all the staff at Montano & Cardall for my new smile.< /text>

<Text>I needed orthodontic treatment because my teeth, like many people, were really crooked. I did not like my smile at all, and I always closed my mouth when I smiled. We chose Montano and Cardall due to the great reviews and feedback given to us my friends. The staff over there is extremely courteous and friendly to us as patients, and because of Montano and Cardall themselves, I got my braces off earlier than anticipated. So now, my teeth are straighter than a steel beam. I now feel confident with the way I smile. We will highly recommend Montano and Cardall Orthodontic Specialists to anyone who needs orthodontic treatment due to there unbeatable service!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Montano and cardall is hands down the best orthodontist in town! The doctors and staff there are incredibly nice and talented. Every appointment was always nice and easy going. I started treatment 2 years ago, before braces I was always insecure about my teeth and couldn’t wait to get my braces on. I’m so lucky to have heard about montano and cardall I couldn’t be any happier with my finished results! I love my smile and can not stop smiling. My experience there was great ❤️</Text>

<text>After being told that he needed to have three teeth extracted, I brought my son to Montano and Card Orthodontics. From day one, everyone was extremely kind and helpful. They explained the process very clearly, and we always felt very comfortable. Three years later, my son has a beautiful smile and no teeth had to be extracted. We are very grateful to the entire team.< /text>< Pictures>

I chose Montano Orthodontics because the staff and Dr. Montano is always so friendly and professional. The receptionist always acknowledged me every time I went in for my appointments and made me feel welcomed. I had my braces for more than a year and I never had any problems with the office. I am very happy with the results.</Review>

<Review>Dr Montano has surpassed our expectations. Our son went from having severe overcrowding and a tooth that wouldn’t come down. Within a few weeks, his teeth look so much better. It’s amazing how fast it all happened. My son is now in high school and excited to have his new amazing smile for display. The service and staff was above and beyond. I’m glad we made the choice to have Dr Montano is our orthodontist.</Review><Response>{'time': 1558634669904, 'text': 'Children’s teeth move so quickly!

After coming home 6 months ago from over seas and having braces put on over there, I need a specialist who was willing to continue work on my teeth. I called so many different orthodontist in Bakersfield and no one was willing to work on another doctors work, but the one phone call to Montano & Cardall they were more than happy to give me a consultation in the same week and take a look at my teeth. The moment I walked in to their office I was honestly so amazed at how beautiful and so nice everyone was there. I mean there really is a reason why it’s been rated the best in Kern County for so many years now. They were able to help me transform my smile in a matter of five months. I got them off today and I really can’t be any more happier at my results. They truly care for their patient</review>

We pursued treated me for my daughter as recommended by her dentist. We had two places in mind but as soon as we set foot in Dr. Montano's office we felt at home. The staff is so welcoming and explained everything so well. My daughter wasn't sure about getting braces but she did hate that her top teeth weren't so perfect. They made her feel so comfortable and took the time to explain the next steps in her treatment each visit. Since getting her braces off she can't stop smiling!  I would definitely recommend Montano Elevated Orthodontics to anyone. They are the best in town. We wouldn't go anywhere else!<//text>

We pursued orthodontic treatment for our son whose teeth had many gaps in them. The gaps caused him to limit his smile. We chose Dr.
Montano because of the professionalism of the office staff as well as the modern treatment options they offer. Now,  my son has a beautiful beaming smile. Thank you!!<//text>

<Text>My oldest child just finished almost three years of treating overcrowding and a narrow jaw. We were referred to Montano by our dentist. Once we began treatment, the office was always welcoming and friendly. Every appointment’s goal was discussed and assessed. The wait was never long, and the timeline for completion of treatment was spot-on. My daughter was very responsible about taking care of her braces. Our other two children have also been referred and examined. They are being monitored to evaluate natural changes instead of rushing in to treatment. We look forward to working with Dr. Montano again when the time comes.< /Text><Date>1558498540627< /Date>< Rate>

<text>I was one of those kids who had braces as a child (TWICE!) but, to the dismay of my parents, never wore my retainers… I sought out Dr. Montano for my third round of treatment since my previous orthodontist had retired. From the start of my treatment, I have been embraced as a member of the family at Montano Elevated Orthodontics. My concerns were addressed with careful attention and I always came away from my appointments feeling thoroughly informed. The team is so genuinely welcoming and Dr. Montano is truly one of the kindest individuals you will ever meet. I felt extremely confident and comfortable with my overall experience; I would highly recommend them to anyone seeking quality orthodontic treatment!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall are the best! Everyone in my family has been treated by them and are very happy with the results. Dr. Montano is great at explaining his treatment plan at every single visit. The staff are very helpful and professional. Every single person I have encountered at their office has been extremely kind and willing to do his best to accommodate your needs. They also send multiple reminds prior to your appointment, which is very helpful. I highly recommend coming here for any of your orthodontic needs!</Review>

<Review>Our teenage daughter needed braces and it just so happened that my sister had just had hers removed. She mentioned how much she liked Montano & Cardall. We called to make an appointment and they were very quick at setting up our appt and getting my daughter seen. Everyone there was so friendly and it was an atmosphere that was so pleasant to be in. Everyone smiling and just so happy. They also play great music. As for my daughter's braces and her appointments everything went well. They explained everything and also let us know when they were most busy and when it was best to make appointments especially if I needed to be in and out fast. My daughter just had them removed yesterday and she was so excited and anxious to see her perfect smile. I'd like to thank Montano & Cardall and their awesome staff for their amazing work and dedication to making all those beautiful smiles. 😁👏👍🤗</Review><Date>1544134754563<//Date>< response>

I came to Montano Orthodontics and do not regret any part of it. My experience overall was great. Dr. Montano along with all the staff were absolutely amazing, kind, and always eager to help in a positive manner. I would refer this orthodontic to anyone and everyone. The inside office itself is eye candy due to the spacious lounge and beautiful canvas images posted along with former patient’s smiles.<//Review>

<Review>My daughter received orthodontic treatment from Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists through the Smile For A Lifetime Foundation. She was really lacking the confidence she needed because of her teeth. We went in not really sure what to expect. But now coming out, our expectations have been surpassed! Not only did they address the issues with her teeth, but they really took into account the whole structure of her face. This was the first time we had encountered such care and concern for a patient. Most orthodontists just want to fix the teeth. It has been nearly 3 years since my daughter first got her braces on, but the transformation is AMAZING! She has so much more confidence now and I find her smiling more often than not. Overall, working with the Montano & Cardall team has been a wonderful experience. I highly recommend them.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377<//gmap_id></record>

I definitely enjoyed my time being while it lasted. Two and half years of having braces went by so fast that I wished it didn't last because I love everything about that place. First of all, the staff's are so nice and friendly. Once you walk in, they welcome you with their smiles, making you feel comfortable. Second of all, all the assistants are so cool! They're always so happy and joyful and they're easy to talk to! Lastly, Doctor Montano and Cardall are awesome! They know exactly what to do with your teeth because mine came out just beautiful! :) I just want to thank everyone who worked there for what they do because without them, I wouldn't have a great experience.</Review>

Before I received treatment from Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall, I had an overbite, some teeth that were almost completely sideways, and a huge gap in between my front teeth.  I was always fine with my smile, until the opportunity arose to improve it.  My dentist had said that braces would be a possibility for me, and we began to search.  We came across Montano and Cardall, and had heard from others that they would be a good choice.  I am so happy we chose them!  Everyone there is so friendly and understanding.  Plus - no needles!  Now that I have no overbite, no sideways teeth, and no gaps, I'm constantly smiling! I feel even more confident than I had before.  The pain and cost was absolutely worth these dazzling pearly whites.< /review>

Dr. Montano and his staff were very friendly and professional during the year I had Invisalign due to a gum recession.  Within a year, my teeth were perfectly straight and my gum recession improved.  The staff took time with me from the first consultation to the very last appointment.  The office is also very clean.  I would highly recommend Dr. Montano to all my family and friends.</Review>

Who knew that at age 65 I would need braces, but my teeth shifted and there I was needing an orthodontist.  I had taken my children to an orthodontist many years ago and it was not a pleasant experience. I was not looking forward to getting braces.

Fortunately my dentist referred me to Montano & Cardall. What I was not looking forward to turned out to be a good experience, well as good as going to a dentist can be.

Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall are wonderful. They are knowledgeable and explained everything, plus they are very nice. That is a hard combination to find. I found out that I could get Invisaligns, that was a good choice, they were easy to wear and people couldn’t tell I was wearing them.

The staff at Montano & Cardall are nice, friendly, and very helpful.

Tho office is beautiful and clean. Both children and adults are comfortable in the office environment.

The appointments ran right on time so there is very little wait time.

<review>7/15/2020 - I just got my BRACES OFF TODAY!!! YASSSS!!! I am so HAPPPPPPY I can cry tears of JOY! It is definitely LIFE CHANGING!!!

First and foremost, I have been wanting to fix my under bite for as long as I can remember. Growing up I have always hated my smile..Every office I went to since I was a teenager (I am 29 now) have said I needed to get jaw surgery or get camouflage braces. I did not like that idea and knew that there was something out there for me.

I have been doing a lot of research for years and found that Dr. Montano does MEAW (Multiloop Edgewise Archwire) Technique for braces. This technique eliminates getting jaw surgery!

Please keep in mind that I am from Fresno, CA. I drive almost 2 hours every other month to Bakersfield for my braces. Talk about dedication lol.

I decided to choose Dr. Montano because there are not too many Orthodontist who perform the MEAW technique. I am lucky to have found Montano's office.

Overall, my experience with the team have been amazing! I love my NEW SMILE and I can't stop SMILING!!! I am grinning from ear to ear!

<text>We decided to take my daughter to Dr Montano & Cardall after learning she needed extensive work. My husbands sister had gone to him as a child & was very pleased with the work so we thought it would be in our best interest to have our daughter be seen by Dr. Montano. From the first visit to the very last and every one in between we were pleased and always had the assurance that we were in great hands. The staff & doctors are great & very knowledgeable in the most up to date orthodontic treatment. We love her results! Thank you Dr. Montano & Cardall! :)< /text>< pics>

My son is a patient of Montano and Cardall and I couldn’t be more pleased with the service I’ve received over these past few years. My son had quite a difficult case and Dr. Montano was able to come up with a treatment plan he felt was best and explained everything along the way. The office is very clean, staff is friendly, and the orthodontists are knowledgeable. I have two younger children who will need braces and I will definitely be returning to Montano and Cardall.<//text>

Dr. Montana and Dr.Cardall are truly the best in Kern County. The took what was nearly impossible and made it happen, they were able to fix my smile. Their level of expertise is incredible. Have two specialists makes a difference, you are able to get a second opinion from either of the doctors. The staff is absolutely amazing, they are all very nice and caring, truly the best I have ever been pleased with meeting. If you are looking for an orthodontist, then this is the go to place. I highly recommend Montano and Cardall Orthodontic Specialists, they can make anything happen.< /Text>

I just finished my Invisalign treatment today and it was the best experience for me! Everyone here always  answered my questions and were always a big help. Dr. Montano is the sweetest person and I'm so sad that my treatment is over! When looking for an orthodontist, look no further.. they are the best and work wonderful as a team to provide their patients with all their needs!

<gmap_id>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377</gmap_id><Review>In my late 30s I found that my teeth/bite had shifted. I had braces as a teenager, but abandoned my good retainer-wearing habits after a couple years post-braces. I didn’t really notice things were moving in my mouth until I started to chip a few teeth and the pronounced gap between my top two middle teeth had begun to re-emerge. My dentist identified my regressing bite as corresponding to the issues I was experiencing and recommended Invisalign so as to preserve the integrity of my teeth as I continue to age. I was extremely pleased with the professionalism and efficiency of Dr. Montano and his staff. I never waited long for appointments and often finished quicker than I anticipated. While the duration of my treatment was longer than originally anticipated by a couple months, I felt assured knowing short cuts were not being taken and that my happiness with the outcome of my teeth was paramount. I wouldn’t hesitate entrusting Montano’s team with your pearly whites, regardless of your individual circumstances/concerns.< /Review>< UserId.>

My daughter hated her teeth and started developing TMJ from her jaw being so off. Well after 26 months of treatment she got them off and she can not stop smiling which she said she was not going to smile because she loved her braces. Her experience with this office was one of the best, they truly take pride I n there work and want there patients to be comfortable at all time.

<Review>My experience at Montano and Cardall was amazing. The staff area always welcoming and easy going. The atmosphere is always positive. The facility itself is also awesome. The best part was that my treatment finished in accordance to their timeline. Making appointments is also easy, and bracket crisis are always managed with a decent amount of time. They also accommodate payments, which makes the experience even better. Over all, I would definitely recommend this office to everyone!!!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Before I received treatment from Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall, I had an overbite, some teeth that were almost completely sideways, and a huge gap in between my front teeth.  I was always fine with my smile, until the opportunity arose to improve it.  My dentist had said that braces would be a possibility for me, and we began to search.  We came across Montano and Cardall, and had heard from others that they would be a good choice.  I am so happy we chose them!  Everyone there is so friendly and understanding.  Plus - no needles!  Now that I have no overbite, no sideways teeth, and no gaps, I'm constantly smiling! I feel even more confident than I had before.  The pain and cost was absolutely worth these dazzling pearly whites.</Text>

<Date>1570072214758<//Date><text>When I first wanted braces, my dentist informed me I would need surgical braces due to the type of bite I had. ( malocclusion class III) When I was referred to Montano orthodontics, it was the best decision I ever made. I was always self conscious and hated smiling because of how my smile looked. Montano orthodontics was there for me every step of the way. From, first getting my braces, to getting me ready for surgery and my post op. I am very satisfied with how my smile looks, the staff was always able to help me with any questions I had and able to fit me in when a bracket came off. I would definitely recommend them if you are thinking about getting braces, the staff is amazing, very welcoming and the orthodontists are the best.<//text>< rate>

Our experience with Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall was Awesome!!!  Both Dr.'s are super nice and really care about your child's outcome.  The whole staff is nice!  The office is nice and comfortable and cheerful and you can see your child while they are getting there treatment.  Their equipment and treatment is state of the art.  My daughter only had to wear her braces for 18 months and never even broke a bracket.  My older daughter went to an older orthodontist that didn't really keep up to date on the newest stuff and she wore her braces for 4 years and was constantly braking brackets.  The price was comparable and 100% worth it.  And...her teeth look absolutely beautiful!!!    Thanks Dr. Montano & Dr. Cardall!!     I will definitely be recommending them to everyone!< /review>

My smile needed help so I went to Montano & Cardall. I chose them because of all of the great reviews and the great results that they produce. Now I think I have a great  smile and it is all thanks to Montano and Cardall Orthodontic Specialists. They have a great atmosphere with very friendly and helpful employees. Everyone who works here is great at their jobs. If you need orthodontic work I would definitely recommend Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists.<//Text>

My son just had his braces taken off this week and I have to say that the experience was so much smoother than either of us had expected...he even got them off 4 months early! He needed to straighten things out and also needed some help to bring a tooth down into place.  We chose Montano & Cardall because we had been referred by so many and we are so glad we went with them. The team was so friendly and really created a fun atmosphere for their patients. He even received a Christmas card from the lady who put his braces on...really made him feel special. I would recommend them to anyone! Great job....and even better people!</review>

<review>We absolutely love our experiences with Montano and Cardall. Both of my children now have beautiful smiles and I am currently getting treated with invisalign and couldn't be more excited to see my results.
Each and every visit we've had has always been a pleasurable one. The office staff are all professional and so nice and always smiling.
I would highly recommend this office.

Thank you for giving us confidence in our smiles :)< /review>< Pics>

<Review>This is an outstanding Orthodontic office and I cannot say enough good things about them.  The orthodontists and staff are very skilled and compassionate and the office staff is extremely competent and pleasant. All 3 of our children had a situation where their jaws were not growing properly. We went to two other orthodontists prior to going to Montano and Cardall and both of those offices recommended plan was to pull numerous teeth from my 3 children, use braces to straighten their teeth and then give them jaw surgery as young adults. After further research we found Montano and Cardall. Their recommended treatment was completely different. By using a Herbst appliance and braces, they were able to slowly encourage their jaws to grow and then used braces to align their teeth properly. Two of our three children have already completed their treatment and have beautiful, healthy teeth and jaws. We are all completely thrilled with Montano and Cardall Orthodontic Specialists. Plus they do everything they can to make each trip to the orthodontist pleasant and fun! It has been a very positive experience working with this office and I highly recommend going for a consultation.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>To make this review quick and simple, going to Montano and Cardall Orthodontics to get my braces is the best decision I have made. I've reviewed various complaints from friends and the orthodontist they went to for their braces and was told they weren't completely satisfied with their care and treatment. Montano and Cardall is everything I wanted from an orthodontics. The care I received was excellent and always had a warm welcome for my appointments. I recommend this place to everyone !</text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

< Review>
Montano & Cardall Orthodontics have been treating my family for a very long time! First, my dad, then my uncle, and now my sister and I have had the pleasure of being treated by two very phenominal orthodontists! I had Dr. Cardall for most of my treatment and I'd say he is a perfectionist! He strived to get my teeth exactly where they should be and even though there was times I practically wanted to rip my braces off myself, I am very happy I didn't because the results are worth the wait! I personally had a great experience! The staff are very friendly and seem to genuinely care about how you are doing!  My dentist recommend I go to an orthodontist and we chose Montano because we already knew they were great. You will not be disappointed if you choose Montano and Cardall Orthodontists!<//Review>

<review>I moved from another country and I had my braces already. One friend recommended me to visit Montano and Cardall office, so when I went there, was a nice place with nice people. The doctor explained me the process and in every appointment I was excited. After they took my braces, I felt my teeth much better, they are the best I recommend.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

My experience here was amazing! The team was amazing and super nice, I always got compliments from them and they make you feel very good about yourself. And having braces here was awesome, because they made it fun! I totally recommend here if you want an amazing experience! The lady at the front desk is always very nice and will greet you every time.

Thanks,

<text>I came to Montano Orthodontics and do not regret any part of it. My experience overall was great. Dr. Montano along with all the staff were absolutely amazing, kind, and always eager to help in a positive manner. I would refer this orthodontic to anyone and everyone. The inside office itself is eye candy due to the spacious lounge and beautiful canvas images posted along with former patient’s smiles.</text>< GmapID>

Our family has had an absolutely great experience here. All three of my daughters needed braces, and all were treated here with great results. (Dr. Montano actually even diagnosed the cause of a breathing problem that my middle daughter was experiencing and corrected it by placing a palate expander.)  We are extremely pleased with the care and attention our family has received here and we highly recommend this practice.<//text>

Happy Mom! My daughter was 10 when her dentist requested an orthodontist. It was either braces now or surgery later. Of course braces sounds best! We've had only great reviews about  Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall. We decided to allow Montana and Cardall to help us with our daughters teeth. Every visit we've had to the orthodontists office has been a pleasure. From the desk up front to all the employees that work there have been beyond amazing. You can definitely  appreciate the friendship that the employees have with one another even joking around with the doctors is fun. You can't find that awesome work place atmosphere very often. My daughter is smiling always and her teeth look beautiful  thanks to there whole team. You can't go wrong when going to Dr. Montano, Dr. Cardall, and staff!   The Vermillions<//Review>

<review>We were referred to Montano and Cardall by our dentist for my daughters crowding and overbite. The office is clean, bright and comfortable, the staff is so friendly and takes the time to explain every step of the process! Every appointment a great experience. My daughter has had Invisalign for about a year and her smile is now perfect, it has been a truly wonderful and easy experience. We owe a huge thank you to everyone at the office for making this journey so painless and easy!!< /review>< Rating>

<Text>I have had nothing but an amazing experience here at Montano Orthodontics. The staff was wonderful. Always welcoming us with a smile and even commenting on how they thought our treatment was coming along. My brother and I both came here and are very happy with how our smiles turned out. He got regular braces and I got the Invisalign. I decided to get treatment because I had one tooth that was gradually moving over time and my alignment was off. I wanted to fix that before anything got worse and caused problems later on in life. I defiantly recommend this place. Best in town:)</Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
We decided Dec 2015 that it was time for my daughter to finally get braces to fix her teeth. They didn't look that bad but she wanted braces to straighten them out. Montano and his staff were amazing from day one. They are all very nice and helpful. My daughter had 9 baby teeth still left at the age of 14 that had to be removed one surgically and they were helpful in getting all this taken care of. Appointments to get her wire fixed/trimmed if it broke or was too long were super easy and fast to get. I would recommend Montano and Cardall to anyone looking to get braces.< /Review>

Best experience ever.  This was actually my second time having braces.  Let's say the first time was over 10 years ago, before I had my wisdom teeth removed through a not so great office.  Going through Montano & Cardall Orthodontics was a pleasant surprise.  Easy to schedule appointments, didn't have to wait more than 5 or 10 minutes before being called back to be seen.  The application of the braces themselves was amazing compared to what I had experienced elsewhere before, as well as the removal.  The staff is amazing and actually try to ensure you are comfortable and explain exactly what is going on.  I would like to thank all the staff at Montano & Cardall for my new smile.</Review>

<Text>By seven years old my daughter had a very bad under bite.  After visiting Dr. Montano, we were glad to know that he was able to correct it.  Dr. Montano and his staff were very friendly and made us feel confident that we were making the right choice to get our daughter's bite fixed.  Today my daughter got her braces removed and her teeth and bite look beautiful.  Dr. Montano, Dr. Cardall, and the entire staff at Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists have always treated us with professionalism, and care.  They are always friendly and willing to answer any questions or help with any concerns.  Thank you for the great care and service!< /Text>< Date>

Amazing staff and facility! The staff is always super friendly and helpful. My teeth before braces weren't the best but weren't the worst. I really wanted to go to a place were they would feel comfortable and this was the place! My smile now is amazing and it was all worth it. Some advice I would have to give is- wear your bands! And make sure you bring attention to any concerns you may have, do not be afraid to ask questions-- they will be more than happy to answer them!<//review>

Before I had braces, I was very insecure with how my teeth looked and I did not like to smile very much. I also used to have a lot of problems with ear and jaw pain because I had an offset jaw and was unaware about it. These lead me towards pursuing orthodontic treatment and I am extremely happy that I chose Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists to fix my teeth and jaw. I heard about Montano & Cardall through some friends and I decided to check it out. From the moment I walked in I knew how well I would be treated there. The staff is very nice and they make you feel welcome and comfortable even when your mouth is in pain. If I would have never gone to Montano & Cardall, I might have never known the problems that my jaw was causing, therefore, the problems may have never been corrected and I would still be in a lot of pain to this day. However, I made the smart choice in choosing this orthodontist and I could not be more happy with the results. I got my braces off one day ago and I cannot stop smiling because my teeth are practically perfect now. I want people to look at my smile and I feel more confident about myself all thank to Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall. If you or anyone are considering choosing this orthodontist for whatever reason, I highly recommend them because I have nothing but good things to say.< /text>

My son was so happy yesterday after they removed his braces, he could not stop sending pictures to his friends and show his beautiful teeth. I was very happy for him as well. For year and a half, we received an excellent care from very friendly and knowledgable staff. Everything in the office is state of the art. We really had a wonderful experience.</Review><user_name>Mihaela Vagliarska</user_name>< rating>

My daughter started seeing Dr. Montano when she was only 6 years old.  A friend recommended that we see Dr. Montano because he was the Best in town.  My daughter's teeth were so crowded, they were pushing out one of her permanent teeth.  We also needed to see a periodontist before she was able to start her orthodontic work.  Dr. Montano and the periodontist had great communication.  Everyone in the office treated my daughter with such care.  She always enjoyed going to her visits.  It is a pleasant and inviting environment.  My daughter got her braces off today.  WOW!!!  She looks amazing.  She has been smiling all day and showing off her new teeth.  I highly recommend Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall.  My son is 10 and he has been going in for a couple of years for a consultation and monitoring.  He will most likely start his treatment in couple of years.  It is great to know that the orthodontists are keeping a close eye on him and he will start when his mouth is ready.</Review>

<text>I have been going to Doctor Montano and Cardall for about a year and a half now and I just got my braces off yesterday! I am completely satisfied with how my teeth turned out. Before my braces, I had an overbite and many gaps. Since I have gotten my braces off I have straight beautiful teeth. Doctor Montano and Cardall have done an amazing job! Everyone in the office is nice, helpful, and I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes to go back for my appointment. Sarah and penny were my favorite hygienists! They are both extremely kind and always ask me how I am and about my day etc. If you are looking for a great orthodontist go to Doctor Montano and Cardall you won't regret it, I promise.< /text>< GmapID>

I needed orthodontic treatment because my teeth, like many people, were really crooked. I did not like my smile at all, and I always closed my mouth when I smiled. We chose Montano and Cardall due to the great reviews and feedback given to us my friends. The staff over there is extremely courteous and friendly to us as patients, and because of Montano and Cardall themselves, I got my braces off earlier than anticipated. So now, my teeth are straighter than a steel beam. I now feel confident with the way I smile. We will highly recommend Montano and Cardall Orthodontic Specialists to anyone who needs orthodontic treatment due to there unbeatable service!< /text>

Dr Montano and Cardall are both amazing dentist and very professional. I was hesitant at first to begin orthodontic treatment thinking it was going to take 2plus years to be able to have the pretty straight smile I've always wanted. They gave me an estimated time of finish which was approximately 14 months, and they were almost spot on give or take 2 weeks! You always feel welcomed the moment you walk into the office with a very professional greeting and they know everyone on first name basis. The girls make the office feel at home with their bright personalities and very professional approach. They are constantly doing fun things to keep their patients active within their practice and up to date on the latest research on orthodontic treatment. The office is probably one of the cleanest dental offices I have been in! If you are hesitant with orthodontic treatment like I was I would recommend going into their office for a orthodontic consultation with their one of a kind consultants. I would highly recommend this office to anyone looking into orthodontic treatment.<//Review>

(Dr. Montano actually even diagnosed the cause of a breathing problem that my middle daughter was experiencing and corrected it by placing a palate expander.)  We are extremely pleased with the care and attention our family has received here and we highly recommend this practice.<//Review>< pics>

I have been with Dr. Montano for about 11 years having braces before and then invisalign later.  My mouth was too small, my jaw alignment was off, my teeth were very crooked.  Dr. Montano and his team has corrected all of my issues! I LOVE my smile now! I am not insecure about smiling and Dr. Montano and his team were always so precise and careful to always make the right decisions.  If you are looking to have any corrections made to your smile always check with Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall first! They are amazing!<//text>

I first went to see Dr. Montano and Cardall about a year and a half ago, and I've had nothing but great experiences every time I've gone in since. I decided to go with M&C because of their excellent reputation and top of the line office/equipment. While there are some places that are cheaper, you definitely get what you pay for in regards to quality and efficiency. Both doctors are knowledgable and passionate about their craft. The staff is always very friendly and accommodating. I just got my braces off earlier today and I couldn't be happier with the results! I didn't realize at the time how much I needed braces, but now when I look back at old photos I see a huge improvement. I highly recommend Dr. Montano and Cardall.</review>

<user_id>106820751356438277816<//user_id><review>After going to different consultations at other Orthodontics offices and being told different things each time, I was about to give up looking for the perfect office that would make me feel comfortable, and not worried that all they wanted was my money. Finally, a friend recommended Dr. Montano's office and I said "why not. Doesn't hurt to go check it out." Well,  from the moment I walked in I knew this was the place.  The environment is very welcoming and of a higher scale.  Super clean and comfortable and the entire staff is always kind and helpful. After my consultation with Dr. Montano, I went back within the week to get my treatment started.  It's been about 9 months and I'm finally at the end of my treatment (i was just getting some minor tweaks done).
I couldn't be more happy with the results we achieved!!<//review><pics>None</pics>< Date>

We loved our experience here! My daughter had to get braces and was told she would have them off in about a year. Today she got them off one year and one month later...her teeth are perfectly straight and she now loves her smile! The staff and Drs. are friendly, helpful, and awesome!...and we were always seen right on time. If we had to choose again where to go for braces, this would be the place! 😁</review>

I had a excellent experience from beginning to end, which end up being many years. I’ll admit it was a bit challenging to get my Adult stubborn teeth to move with Invisalign’s, however the Dr’s did not give up on me! They did different procedures to help me achieve the straight teeth I’ve always wanted! - Thank you!   Everyone in the office is awesome! They’re very friendly & professional!

<review>Took my daughter here and had a great experience. Treatment took a few more months than projected but it was worth it! She had a tooth coming in between the wrong teeth and they moved it over to the correct place quickly. Her teeth look so beautiful now and she is beyond happy to show off her beaming smile without fearing judgment or being made fun of.< /review>< username>

My experience with Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall was terrific! I never had the slightest bit or worry in my mind when it came to my treatment. I had my braces for a little over 2 years and loved every single minute! In fact, I'm pretty sad my treatment is over because I just love all the staff so much. I was always so excited for every appointment I had. Everybody is so kind and want what is best for you at all times. Although I'll miss going to all my appointments, I absolutely love my new smile! I knew that it would turn out great, and I love it even more than I was expecting. If you or a loved one are considering orthodontic treatment, I definitely recommend Dr. Montano and Cardall. They're the best in town!</review>

I never really considered getting braces until I was referred by my dentist and I am glad that he made the referral. I am extremely happy with the final results. The team at Montano and Cardall are passionate and friendly. Also there was never any pain other than short term tenderness. The whole process was smooth and I enjoyed each visit.<//text>

Doctors Montano and Cardall took great care in deciding on what my daughter needed and executed perfectly. Her teeth look amazing. The doctors did not prolong her treatment for financial gain, as straightening her teeth and perfecting her bite were their priority.The office staff are extremely friendly and helpful, always looking out for any needs that may arise.

I love everybody's positive attitude. They really make you feel like home. Through out my whole experience at Dr.Montano's has been amazing and I highly recommend this place not only for their happy minds but also for their professional work. My teeth was one of my biggest insecurities and I love my smile now because of them.<//Review>

<Text>My dentist is the one who referred me to Montano & Cardall Orthodontic about two years ago when it was time for me to get braces. In my opinion my teeth weren't too bad but I didn't really like them either. Once I walked into Montano Orthodontic I knew that I would like it there because everyone was really friendly. Now that my braces are finally off I can say I LOVE my smile. Everyone on the team is really sweet and they always have a big smile on there face from the moment you walk in until the moment you leave. In my opinion if you need braces then you should definitely go to Montano & Cardall Orthodontic's.</Text><user>105965029750561616569<//user></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Highly recommended!  Our son was in treatment for about 4 years.  Dr. Montano, was able to reshape his mouth with no surgery and no pulling of teeth.  Our daughter was also received  treatment and  both kids had very pleasant results.  The office staff is friendly, is it easy to get an appointment.< /Text><gmapID>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377< /gmapID>< user>

I initially had braces on in high school but with another orthodontist and was very unsatisifed. My second time around I was referred to Montano and Cardall by aunt who had her orthodontic work done many years ago. I just got my braces off and I’m so happy I decided to go with them. Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall as well as their staff did an amazing job! Throughout my experience with this office for the past two years I have told everyone about them and will continue to do so. They truly are the best!</Text>

I would rarely smile because of my missing tooth. We we're recommended by my dentist to doctor Montano & Cardall orthodontics. We had never heard of them, but after my first visit I had a great experience. We decided to ask around and the people we spoke to that were previous patients had nothing but amazing things to say. It made my parents and myself feel confident about working with doctor Montano & Cardall. I had an amazing experience with both doctor Montano, doctor Cardall, but also all the staff. The lady's at the front desk and dental assistants were always so professional. I am very pleased with my smile and feel more confident about smiling. To anyone that is considering seeing an orthodontist I would 100% recommend Montano & Cardall orthodontic specialist. It is a little more than other orthodontist but they do offer a payment plan. From now on every time someone comments on my smile I'll be proud to say that I had my work done at Montano & Cardall Orthodontics.< /Text>< UserId.>

<Review>We did a lot of research before deciding to go with Dr. Montano for our daughter’s Invisalign treatment. After meeting with him and his staff, we knew that he was our guy! He is absolutely wonderful with our daughter and incredibly friendly. The office staff is very kind. Our daughter just finished her Invisalign treatment and we are very happy with the results. We will be back with daughter #2! Thank you for such a great experience!</Review>< pictures>

I started my orthodontic treatment, because I love to travel and take pictures. So, I wanted to have the perfect smile. I wasn't feeling too bad about my teeth before that, but I knew that they could look better. I got a recommendation to try Dr. Montano & Cardall and I am so happy I did. They are very professional and on top of everything. I feel that my smile is perfect now. I can't stop looking at the mirror and smiling. Their team is very polite and excellent. My advice for others is to be persistent. This is the only way to get the best results!!!< /Review>

Who knew that at age 65 I would need braces, but my teeth shifted and there I was needing an orthodontist.  I had taken my children to an orthodontist many years ago and it was not a pleasant experience. I was not looking forward to getting braces.

Fortunately my dentist referred me to Montano & Cardall. What I was not looking forward to turned out to be a good experience, well as good as going to a dentist can be.

Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall are wonderful. They are knowledgeable and explained everything, plus they are very nice. That is a hard combination to find. I found out that I could get Invisaligns, that was a good choice, they were easy to wear and people couldn’t tell I was wearing them.

The staff at Montano & Cardall are nice, friendly, and very helpful.

Tho office is beautiful and clean. Both children and adults are comfortable in the office environment.

The appointments ran right on time so there is very little wait time.

<Review>The Montano & Cardall team is exceptional!!! We would highly recommend this orthodontic specialists to anyone.  My son's braces just came off today and we are very happy with the results.  His teeth were aligned to perfection in less than two years.....several months ahead of schedule.  All the staff in the office are very friendly and professional.  His visits were relatively short because the wait was very minimal. When my son had any unexpected issues with his braces, it was very easy to get him in right away to fix the issue.  They were always very accommodating and the office is very efficient.< /Review>< pictures>

My experience with Dr. Montano Dr. Cardall and their staff has been amazing. From day one they all have been positive, encouraging, and remained patient and helpful through out my care. Their office is very welcoming and doesn't have your typical orthodontics environment. One of the many benefits of this office is that you could get a second opinion within the minute, seeing as their are two specialists working in the same place. If you are at all interested in getting braces I 100% recommend going to Montano & Cardall.< /review>

She was really lacking the confidence she needed because of her teeth. We went in not really sure what to expect. But now coming out, our expectations have been surpassed! Not only did they address the issues with her teeth, but they really took into account the whole structure of her face. This was the first time we had encountered such care and concern for a patient. Most orthodontists just want to fix the teeth. It has been nearly 3 years since my daughter first got her braces on, but the transformation is AMAZING! She has so much more confidence now and I find her smiling more often than not. Overall, working with the Montano & Cardall team has been a wonderful experience. I highly recommend them.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

We started with Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists when my daughter was 7.  Her dentist noticed a cross bite at one of her regular visits and referred us over for a consult.  I was concerned with her being so young to start any orthodontic work.  I thought what was the big deal right now.   But,  after looking at the pictures and x-rays and  Dr. Montano educating us at her consult we decided we shouldn't wait.   They fixed my daughters cross bite and  a couple of years later got braces because of crooked teeth that never aligned. She recently just got them off.  We are so pleased with her smile and how beautiful her teeth  aligned up.  Both Dr. Montano and Dr.Cardall were wonderful with my daughter.  Very pleasant and kind each and every time we've been there. The office is welcoming and very fun...always having contests and giving prizes away.
I have 2 other daughters and hope we don't need anymore orthodontic  work but if we do, we will return to these guys.<//Text>

<Text>I felt a better smile would give me more confidence in myself, I was really insecure about my smile so I tried not to socialize too much. I chose Doctors Montano and Cardall because they offered a really cool scholarship for braces in which it would be free of charge with me which was perfect because I couldn't afford orthodontic treatment. Words can't express how happy I am with my smile now, I want to show it off to the world!!! The team were very professional and demonstrated their expertise with every treatment I've ever received. I would advise others that there is always a solution to the problems that they have and go pursue any change they want to make within themselves!<//Text>< pictures>

My experience with Dr. Montano, Dr. Cardall and their staff was awesome!!! It’s been about 2 ½ years when I made the decision to get my braces on and it was the best decision I ever made. I use to be so self-conscious about myself never really smiled, everyone would always ask why I looked so serious or mad when I wasn't. I just didn't smile at all. My teeth were pretty bad so, I decided one day to make an appointment with my dentist to see what I could do to improve my smile. That’s when they recommended to go see Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall office. When I went to my appointment the staff super nice. They answered all my questions and concerns I had at the time. Now after 2 ½ years braces are off and it has given me a major boost in my self-esteem. =D I love the way me teeth turned out after the treatment. I definitely would recommend anyone that isn't happy about their smile to go with Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall they both are amazing doctors.< /Review>

The staff at Montano’s office were always friendly and happy to answer any of our questions.  They were also able to consistently get us in quickly when she broke off a bracket or snapped a powerband by mistake.  My Daughter is the second of my children to go to Montano, and I could not recommend him enough!!

For those of you looking for a great orthodontist you have come to the right place!  Dr. Montano and his staff have been great!  Not only are they wonderful, but Dr. Montano is exceptional! We joke that he’s now working on our second generation and will hopefully still be practicing when the third generation comes through!  He was my orthodontist when I was 15 and he also put braces on both of my brothers!  I’m a mother now of three children and my 13 year old, who is the youngest, just got them a couple of weeks ago.  She was not happy about having to get them on, (I mean what teenager is,) but now that she is seeing the changes so soon; she is very happy and is very comfortable with them.  Your child will walk away feeling well informed on where they are with their progress and confident after their visit.
As a parent nothing brings you more joy than to see your child’s beautiful smile after those braces come off and the confidence a wonderful smile gives them.
Every parent wants the BEST doctor for their child and I can tell you without a doubt, Dr. Montano is the BEST!  You will NOT be disappointed by Dr. Montano nor by his staff who have ALWAYS been incredible!</Review>

I've reviewed various complaints from friends and the orthodontist they went to for their braces and was told they weren't completely satisfied with their care and treatment. Montano and Cardall is everything I wanted from an orthodontics. The care I received was excellent and always had a warm welcome for my appointments. I recommend this place to everyone !</Text>< pictures>

I had a severe overbite. My bottom teeth would dig into the roof of my mouth while I slept so I decided to get braces to help correct the problem. My dentist recommend Dr Montano and Dr Cardall.  After the consultation I decided I liked the treatment plan they came up with.
After 19 months, my braces are off and teeth feel great and look great. This was the best decision I could have made for teeth. The office staff and Drs are wonderful and very friendly. They worked around my schedule did their best to always fit me in immediately for emergencies, yes broken brackets happen!
I would recommend Montano and Cardall to friends and family.</text>

< review>
When I first thought about getting braces I was worried that I was going to have them on for a couple of years because how messed up I thought my teeth were. My husband had braces when he was in high school and when I went to his orthodontist I honestly didn't like them very much. So I talked to my Aunt-in-law and they went to Montano. I was like alright I'll go check it out. When I first went I loved it. Everyone is very friendly and nice. I sat down and talked to Dr Montano and he told me he can get my teeth fixed in 2 years even with having to get surgery. 2 years later and they're finally off and I love my new smile. Hands down Dr Montano and Dr Cardall are the best out there. They try to make your visit as most comfortable as possible, very flexible around when things come up and they work with your financial situation as well. I highly recommend coming to Montano and Cardall if you're thinking about braces!!!</review>

We are so thankful for such a friendly, knowledgeable group at Montano & cardall. Among so many wonderful things about their office , the doctors themselves take time to explain to parents and kids what's happening. They are respectful and friendly, taking however much time is needed. The office is kid friendly, and never crowded. We are in and out, which my kids are never thrilled about because they want more time in the video game room!<//text>

My daughter is so thankful for Montano & Cardall Orthodontics! Her best friend had recommend us to go here, because she was a customer and she loved the service and place. My daughter was not confident in her smile before braces and upon wearing braces she became more confident and now having her braces off, she smiles all day long! The staff there is so helpful and nice, they answer all questions, and they teach you step by step how to do the new things the ortho wants us to do. Being a customer there for over 2 years we have never had problems, and we have always been well taken care of! We had other experiences at different orthodontics and we highly recommend  Montano & Cardall! They're a one of a kind service and there is no other place like there! We had a great experience and we defiantly will refer friends! Montano & Cardall orthodontics staff became our family!!<//Review>

I had my metal braces on for a year and half a little more than expected as I wasn't fully satisfied with my teeth on what was supposed to be my last visit but the doctors were more than willing to work with me and we're not pushy to have them taken on off until I was fully satisfied. The front desk was especially great they sent me extra rubber bands if I wasn't able to come in and always accommodated me.< /review>

Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall both worked on my case and they were both very knowledgable and enthusiastic with my progress.  I couldn't have asked for a better experience with Invisalign.  I definitely recommend them to anyone in the market for braces or Invisalign.< /Text>< rate>

My experience At montano was the greatest! Everybody was always smiling and super nice. They were always super organized when scheduling appointments and super quick when I arrived for my appointment. The office was always in neat condition and they were super clean. This is by far one of the best orthodontic office in Bakersfield. My sister is continuing to work with them and she is also very please with their service. I recommend this place to anyone :)< /review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>I would definitely recommend this orthodontic to relatives and friends. Great treatment in a short amount of time. There was never a problem rescheduling an appointment, and no problem fitting the appointment into my busy schedule. I was embarrassed to smile or to even show my teeth at all, but Montano & Cardall Orthodontic's invisalign fixed me up in no time! I am not afraid to show off my straight teeth, and my beautiful smile, as what their staff told me. The friendly staff at this orthodontic are always positive, and made sure you were comfortable before doing any work. Once again, I am very satisfied with the results from, which i feel, is the best orthodontic in Bakersfield.<//Text>< Pics>

I loved how quickly they got patients in & out.  I am the last one in the family to get my teeth straightened & I will definitely be going to Montana & Cardall, they are great at what they do & they're a pleasure to work with.

<Review>I found Montano and Cardall when searching for invisalign providers in the area. I had a couple gaps in teeth i was looking to fix, and I didn't want to get braces. They had amazing reviews and lots of experience with invisalign (one of two diamond plus providers in the area), as well as the iTero scanning system. It's been a great experience with them. My teeth look great, the duration of treatment was about what was estimated, and pricing was upfront. They were great with working with me on appointments and rescheduling. The staff and office are amazing as well.<//Review></record>

Before I went to Montano and Cardall I had an overbite and a gap between my front teeth. I hated smiling because I thought my teeth were ugly. The first time I went there the staff was so kind and they took my feelings to heart. I was nervous about my braces but was ready to have a beautiful smile. The process of getting my braces put on was very quick and easy. The people in the office talked me through the process step by step, before they started. Every time I had a problem with my braces they fixed it as soon as possible. Now my braces are gonna and I have the beautiful smile I've always wanted. Thank you Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall, and all of the staff in the office. I am now way more confident than before and love showing off my smile!!!<//review>

< review>
I went to Montano and Cardall orthodontics after receiving a recommendation from my dentist. I had always been unhappy with my smile and thought it was finally time to take care of it. After getting some surprising news that my case was going to be more in depth than the typical orthodontic case, I wasn’t sure what to do. I was informed along with braces I would also need to undergo two surgeries. This news was not fun to hear but I knew I needed to proceed. I never felt the need to get a second opinion because Dr. Montano and the staff made me feel comfortable and secure that my well being was in great hands. They were very quick to get started and on my way to a perfect smile. 3 months after getting my braces I had my first surgery. That experience was a game changer. The procedure is known as SARPE (surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion) and I’m not going to sugar coat it, it SUCKED! I was unable to chew anything for 2 months, causing me to lose 25 pounds, it left me with a inch gap in between my two front teeth, and I also had a large very uncomfortable metal device attached to my top teeth holding my jaw together. Needless to say for about 10 months (the total time it took to completely heal) I was immensely regretting my decision. This also led me to have a conversation with Dr. Montano about my apprehension to proceed with the next, more invasive, surgery. But luck was fortunately on my side! Dr. Montano felt the results from my first surgery were better than expected and I would be able to get away without having to do the second procedure. This was amazing news for me to hear and brightened my spirits.
So after 2 years and 3 months and one horrible surgical experience I am happy to say my braces are now off and I am happier than ever. My road to a beautiful smile would not be the same without everyone at the Montano and Cardall office. I cannot speak highly enough of all of them. Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall were incredible at making me feel that my case was important and it was their mission to provide me with the best care. Every one of the assistants are caring and sympathetic. They took special care of me and I am forever grateful. Anyone who is unhappy with their smile should definitely go see Montano and Cardall orthodontic specialists! It will change your life.</review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Absolutely love Dr. Montano's staff! Very informative friendly. They have top of the line technology and give you very detailed information about the process. Being that I was a previous patient of Dr. Montano from my childhood, I knew where to take my daughter to get braces. She never liked to smile because of her crooked teeth. And now her teeth look amazing and now she's not afraid to smile!! She is extremely happy with the outcome and so am I. He did an amazing job then and still does an amazing job now. My youngest daughter will need them as well, and Dr. Montano & Cardall will be the place we will continue to go.</Review>< pictures>

I loved how friendly all the staff are and how clean the place is. I highly recommend this place, i was supposed to have braces for 2 years and got them off a few months earlier, so they are really effective fast if you keep up with what they tell you to do such as wear your rubber bands. The doctors are really good and make you feel welcomed everytime. 10/10 highly recommend<//Text>

I started my orthodontic and maxillofacial journey very unhappily.  I did not want braces or surgery.  Dr. Montano and his staff were AMAZING since Day One.  Everyone is so personable, helpful and informed.  Dr. Montano is a wonderful orthodontist.  He did an amazing job on my teeth and bite.  Dr. Montano hosts events for kids and adults.  He is very modern with technology.  His office is clean, warm, welcoming, organized.  I had to wait (for only about 15 minutes) ONE time during my entire experience.  Dr. Montano honors appointment times and is efficient.  At the end, I'm glad I took care of my necessary teeth/jaw issues and am VERY pleased with the results.  Thank you to Dr. Montano and all the wonderful staff I interacted with during the process.  There are so many kind, personal touches from the staff.  I would recommend Montano Orthodontics to anyone for excellent medical and personal attention.<//Text>

Dr. Montano is a terrific person I got my braces through smiles for lifetime and it was just an awesome experiment ! Everyone in the office is friendly and they learn your name they are really there for you whenever you need them. Also its a great place if you have a busy life they are extremely flexible with setting up appointments. AND THEY GET THE JOB DONE FAST, a lot of offices that many of my friends went to took triple the amount of time that I took and my teeth were worst then theirs. It took them a year and a half just about I went through everything from the metal band to rubber bands and my teeth dramatically changed !!! everywhere I go now I get people telling me how pretty my smile is. I love them all everyone should go to them ...and also they have a lot of pay options also !!! ...and also there office is so nice so nice ....well yeah they are the best !!</Review>

Both of my sons are autistic and can be a challenge, but the staff at Montano Orthodontics are patient and caring, allowing them time to adjust to any changes that have be made throughout the visit.  They both look forward to each visit, and as a result, our 12 year old twin girls are also excited about getting braces.< /review>< Name>

Dr. Cardall has fit right in to the Montano Orthodontics family and is exceptionally attentive, professional, and kind.  We are pleased with the treatment process and completely satisfied with the end results.  Not only does Dr. Montano take good care of his patients, it is heartwarming watching him give back to the community through the Smile for a Lifetime Foundation.

<Rating>5</Rating><text>My sons and I have been going to Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall for 6 years and we have had an amazing experience. They are both amazing orthodontists.  They are very knowledgeable and care a lot about their patients. My oldest son has had 2 sets of braces and both orthodontists have saved my son a lot of pain and future problems.  I also had Invisalign and had a great experience.  The office staff is also very caring.  We always get the best treatment.  Through the years they have helped us in many ways.  I would definitely recommend these orthodontists and this office to everyone.

Dr. Montano and Cardall are both really great! They helped me reach the goal of having a beautiful smile and I love my new smile and can't stop smiling. They are each good at what they do, and I think that they are really creating the most beautiful smiles in Bakersfield. Thanks Dr. Montano and Cardall for my beautiful smile! :)< /text>

Dr Montano & Cardall and their staff were wonderful.  They were absolutely wonderful through the whole experience of getting the braces on and all the way through the process of getting them off.  My daughter's smile is priceless now!!  I recommend them 100%.  Very professional and helpful in all aspects.  Thank you for everything!!!< /review>

They have fast service and their friendly hospitality creates a warm welcoming atmosphere for the customers the minute they step foot in their office. They treat every customer as part of  their family and they serve you in a professional and kind manner. They are always concerned about the customer's. They go the extra mile to help. They send birthday, reminder, thank you cards to each customer they've treated; when you need extra rubber bands, it is guaranteed they send them in the mail directly to you. I definitely would recommend Montano and Cardall Orthodontics to anyone in need of braces (even if they are in thought about it ).<//text>< pics>

We have really loved our experience at Montano and Cardall Orthodontics.  My wife and I had our braces with Dr. Montano many years ago. This time around our daughter had the opportunity for Dr. Cardall  to work with her on braces.  We were very pleased with both doctors.  They were very thorough, attentive to any concerns or questions and personable. Their staff was so friendly and really made the attempt to connect with you and made you feel cared for and known.
My daughter will miss seeing her favorite orthodontist assistant- she definitely went above and beyond in helping her through some of the more extensive appointments.
Her last ortho visit was today, after two years of treatment, her bite is perfect now - AND her smile is just beautiful.
Another thing I really liked about their office was that they were prompt with getting you in for the time your appointment was scheduled.
We would definitely recommend them!</review>

The level of professionalism and care Drs. Montano and Cardall and all the staff provide is Amazing! My case was pretty severe, I was in treatment for a very long time and I am extremely satisfied with my results! I have been to other orthodontic offices and I guarantee this office is the best, I and two of my sisters have come here for treatment and we are all extremely happy with our results and the service they provide. Everyone is so great, very kind and very attentive.<//review>

My daughter didn't have anything major wrong with her teeth.  She only required Invisalign for 12 months to perfect her bite. Invisalign was the perfect choice for her, as she is very responsible and wore her liners as required.  My son, on the other hand, requires more extensive work and is not quite as responsible, so we will have braces put on him next year.  We will be returning to Montano and Cardall for his treatment, as well.  The entire process ran very smoothly from start to finish.  We loved our consultation...everything was explained very clearly to us regarding the entire procedure and the finances.  I think my favorite thing about Montano and Cardall is the reception staff.  They are incredibly friendly and accommodating.  With crazy schedules these days it was absolutely imperative that we had a staff who could be flexible with appointment times.  They always went above and beyond to get us in when we needed to or change our appointment time if something came up.  We are very pleased with the final results of our daughter's smile.  It looks so beautiful and she is more confident than ever!<//Review>

<Text>My daughter's teeth were extremely crooked. She was required to start treatment at third grade. They began treatment by widening her pallet in order to avoid having to pull teeth. I as very thankful that she did not have to have any teeth pulled.
I wanted her to go to Dr. Montano because he was my orthodontist. Her smile turned out beautiful and we are very happy with the results. Dr. Montano's office was extremely  efficient. I would recommend Dr. Montano to all people in need of orthodontic care.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377</Gmap_id></record>

When I first got braces I was really nervous. I wasn't sure how they would be
, all I knew is that I wanted my teeth fixed. My sister and brother had also gone to Montano (before Cardall was around) and gotten their teeth fixed. I was just next in line. The braces felt weird and were hard to get used to. They hurt and ached my teeth. It got to the point where I wanted to pull my teeth out, but it was all worth it. My teeth look amazing and I don't think anyone could have done better. The moment they took them off my teeth just felt naked. It was very unusual having these shiny slimy things replace my metal gear.Though it took a while to get used to changing back my teeth look great. I know longer have to worry about crooked teeth and a cross bite thanks to Cardall and Montano.</Text>

My treatment takes longer than anticipated. However, Dr. Montano takes a good care of me. He works collaboratively with my oral surgeon during the treatment. Dr. Montano, Dr. Cardall, and the staff are great. They are very friendly and supportive.  His office has with all modern medical equipments. The price may not be cheap, but you get a first class treatment, so it's totally worth it. I can't wait to take off my braces by the end of this year. Thanks the Montano Orthodontics team.</text>

I moved from another country and I had my braces already. One friend recommended me to visit Montano and Cardall office, so when I went there, was a nice place with nice people. The doctor explained me the process and in every appointment I was excited. After they took my braces, I felt my teeth much better, they are the best I recommend.<//review>

<Review>I've had a great experience at Montano & Cardall. My teeth look amazing. Before treatment, my teeth were beginning to break down from years of being misaligned.  The older I get, the more important it is to protect and preserve my teeth for the future.  Mantano & Cardall have treated both of my children with  braces over the past five years. We have had nothing but great results every time. Now,  it's my husbands turn and I am confident that his outcome will be just as great. The staff is always caring and professional. Doctors Montano & Cardall are very personable and  give every patient  their full attention. It is that personal touch that really make a difference. A big thank you  to everyone at Montano & Cardall for my beautiful smile!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<time>1484806050210<//time><rate>5</rate><review>Before I had braces, I was very insecure with how my teeth looked and I did not like to smile very much. I also used to have a lot of problems with ear and jaw pain because I had an offset jaw and was unaware about it. These lead me towards pursuing orthodontic treatment and I am extremely happy that I chose Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists to fix my teeth and jaw. I heard about Montano & Cardall through some friends and I decided to check it out. From the moment I walked in I knew how well I would be treated there. The staff is very nice and they make you feel welcome and comfortable even when your mouth is in pain. If I would have never gone to Montano & Cardall, I might have never known the problems that my jaw was causing, therefore, the problems may have never been corrected and I would still be in a lot of pain to this day. However, I made the smart choice in choosing this orthodontist and I could not be more happy with the results. I got my braces off one day ago and I cannot stop smiling because my teeth are practically perfect now. I want people to look at my smile and I feel more confident about myself all thank to Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall. If you or anyone are considering choosing this orthodontist for whatever reason, I highly recommend them because I have nothing but good things to say.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>This place is awesome! If you or your child is in need of orthodontic care--look no further. This is the place! From the time my daughter first entered the building 18 months ago to yesterday when she had her braces removed, we always felt welcome, supported and in very good hands. The doctors are very thorough and explained all the steps to us which eased our minds. She loved having her braces on but has not stopped smiling since having them removed! Her face is so bright now--thank you for making my daughter even more beautiful than she already was! We will be back with our other 2 children. :-)</Review>< UserId.>

<Text>I started going to Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall in May of 2016. I cannot be happier with my results, and the wonderful journey of orthodontics they led me on. They were always helpful, attentive, and even rewarded you for having good hygiene! I highly recommend them.< /Text><Time>1508971543699<//Time>< Pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Our son got his braces off yesterday and hasn't stopped smiling since.  From his initial consultation two years ago, to his last appointment we have found the staff at Montano & Cardall very professional.  Having people at the front desk who make eye contact and greet you with a smile definitely creates a positive atmosphere.  His treatment plan was explained very clearly to us, and to him.  Any questions we had were promptly answered.  He broke wires and brackets more than once ad was seen within 24 hours every time.  We will be taking our younger child to them when it is time for him to start orthodontic treatment.  We recommend Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists to everyone who asks.< /text>< gmap_id>

I feel great now my braces are off!   I came here because my aunt and uncle got braces with Dr Mantano  when they were in school.

<rating>5</rating><text>Dr. Montano has been a prominent orthodontist for many years in Bakersfield. It's obvious that he and his staff have a lot of pride in their office and in their  patient care. As soon as you walk in, the receptionist makes sure you feel welcome.  The office is beautiful and well kept.  They supply free wifi, coffee, and fruit-infused water.  The kids can keep busy with video games near the waiting area, and there is a sitting area for the parents to be near their child during the exam. The assistants were more than willing to answer any questions that I had after  appointments, and they seemed to connect well with my son.  He is more than happy with his new smile, as am I.  I'm glad I decided to trust a well established orthodontist in Bakersfield.<//text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I love everything about Montano & Cardall Orthodontic. I thought I would forever have to live with my underbite, and that no one would be able to help me have the smile I wanted. Dr. Montano made my dreams of a having pretty smile a reality. I am forever thankful. He collaborated with me and my oral surgeon on exactly what I needed. He made it incredibly easy for my surgeon to identify what needed to happen during my surgery. Dr. Montano made this journey an incredibly easy one. I just sat back and enjoyed the ride while he put in all of the work. He and his staff are very friendly. The office is very comfortable and inviting. He is extremely educated and I would trust no one else with the journey of braces. He knows exactly what he is doing. Well worth everything. Thank you Dr. Montano for everything. You are amazing!!<//Text>

<Review>My two sons have gone to Dr. Montano for orthodontic treatment, and one recently got his braces off.  It is amazing how good his teeth look compared to two years ago.  Dr. Montano is personable, and it is obvious when you go to his office that he and his staff care for the patients.  I would not recommend going anywhere else for treatment but here.</Review>< response>

<Review>Before I went to Doc. Montano & Cardall I thought my teeth were fine clearly I was wrong. They really take care of you and take the time to make the atmostsphere a welcoming place. I just got my braces off a few days ago and I feel free and fantastic! I feel a lot more confident and find it easier to smile! The team is outstanding! You can tell that they are actually caring and that they care about you. My advice to others is to always wear your rubber bands when the docs say to! I didn't and had to end up wearing them longer. One more thing to add they have amazing financial options so you don't have to worry about going broke to get an amazing smile!!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377<//Gmap_id></record>

Dr. Montano straightened the teeth of all three of my kids, and they look fabulous. They still come back, even though they are all done, and get hugs from staff members.  It says a lot about a doctor's office and the staff there when kids actually look forward to going!  Bravo, Montano and Cardall.  I will absolutely recommend you to everyone who asks!!!<//Text>

Every visit was great. The staff become your friends, everyone is nice, and the atmosphere is safe and warm. The facility itself is clean, professional, and well-organized. You never have to wait past your appointment time, and there is a small arcade to entertain children (or adults, if you're into that kind of thing). I'm sad to get my braces off, since I won't be coming back anymore. If you're looking for an orthodontist, whether it be an interview for a school research paper or getting braces, this is the best place in Bakersfield (Probably even California, but I haven't checked unpopulated areas. Besides that, they're the best out of everyone else).< /text>

<text>I decided to pursue orthodontic treatment because my teeth were extremely crooked. Before pursuing orthodontic treatment, I was a bit insecure about smiling. My family and I decided to choose Montano & Cardall to do my orthodontic treatment because my dentist recommended them to me after hearing positive feedback from their clients. After getting my braces removed, I fell in love with the way my teeth looked. They were very immaculate. Now, I can’t stop looking at them nor stop smiling. The staff at Montano are very well-organized, friendly, and helpful. As long as you follow the doctors’ instructions, you will be satisfied with the results.<//text></record></dataset><record>
<review>I have just completed my Invisalign treatment and couldn’t be more pleased with the results.

As a 55 year old who has never had braces, I found myself becoming more self conscious about my shifting teeth that became more crooked with every passing year.

My treatment took just under a year and other than very slight discomfort after changing trays, was pain free.

Dr. Montano and his staff are very knowledgeable, friendly and take time to explain the entire treatment. I was very appreciative of the fact that I never sat in the waiting room for more than 5 minutes to be called to the back for my appointment!

My only regret is that it took me this long to spend a little extra money on myself. I am so excited to show off my new smile!<//review>< Response>

I had my daughter go there two years ago and I could not be more pleased with the results.
I just finished my treatment with Dr. Montano a couple of months ago and I honestly have nothing but great things to say about the whole experience.
I’m very pleased with the results as well as the way I was treated by the staff.
The office is always spotless, well organized.  Among mahy other things,  I appreciate the fact that I never had to wait long for my appointments.
Thank you for giving me and my daughter the beautiful smile we’ve always wanted.
Dr Montano is the best.  Highly recommended.</text>

I had braces as a teenager; however, only wore my retainer a couple of years after getting them. As a result, my teeth shifted a bit and after starting to notice it more and more in pictures I decided I wanted to straighten them again.

My dentist recommended Montana and Cardall, so I went for a consultation. I didn't expect that there would be as much of a medical need as a cosmetic need to straighten my teeth. My bite had also shifted, which can apparently cause problems.

I chose Invisalign on Dr. Montano's suggestion. During the course of my 14 month treatment, the staff were friendly and helpful.

My teeth are straight again and my bite is on point. Definitely happy with the results. I recommend Montano and Cardall as well as wearing your retainer!< /text>

<Review>I was referred to Dr Montano by my dentist who said he would take care of me. I scheduled an appointment with him. Meeting with Crystal and getting an office tour was great. Everyone was very friendly.  I was very embarrassed to smile because of the huge gaps in my teeth. I honestly thought it couldn't get fixed. Dr Montano and his team proved me wrong. My smile has never looked this good. I would definetly recommend Dr Montano and Dr Cardall!< /Review><Date>1504745593554< /Date><username>Linda Gonzalez (danielzprincezz)<//username>< user>

<text>Dr Montano was our orthodontist over 15 years ago for both my kids and did a great job perfecting beautiful smiles.   This year both myself and my adult son found ourselves in need of orthodontic help.  How awesome to see many of the same staff.  Less then a year later, we are both at the finish line !

Their new office is extremely nice. I love their Keurig coffee machine and other beverages that they offer. They also have an arcade for the kids which looks really fun. Overall, I am very satisfied with how my treatment turned out. Thanks for my fantastic smile!</Review><Gmap_id>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377</Gmap_id>< UserId.>

I had a great experience as a young adult and took my daughter back when she needed orthodontics. The doctors and staff are great. I encourage anyone who needs orthodontics to not hesitate!<//Review>

<text>I pursued my orthodontic treatment due to feeling insecure about my own smile and always hiding my teeth from everyone I knew . I never smiled and I never wanted to take pictures . I knew my teeth needed help and I needed to do something about it. My teeth before were crooked and probably the most embarrassing feature about myself . I was so ashamed of my own smile . I chose montano and cardall because of their wonderful ratings and also their smile for a lifetime foundation program . My family wasn’t well off and I wasn’t working yet and I really needed to get braces. Without their program it never would’ve happened . Today I feel absolutely stunning in my own smile. My smile is more beautiful than I could of ever imagined . I never thought my teeth could possibly look this great and be this straight . The team at montano and cardalls office are outstanding !!! They are the most friendliest people you could meet and always take great care of me . I never left unsatisfied . They are the best staff of doctors I have ever come across . I am so happy with their treatment . My advice for others is to not wait to long ! Get braces at a young age and always BRUSH AND FLOSS . Also , braces are going to hurt and take time , but the outcome is more than you could ever wish for .</text>< username>

<rating>5<//rating><text>I just got my braces off today..... And I can't stop smiling! My teeth weren't so bad, but I wanted them straight. I had a boyfriend at the time, who's niece was going to get the metal braces. She was frightened, so I'd thought to get the metal braces right along with her so she can have someone to relate to. I was referred to Montano and Cardall by a co-worker of mine, and it is the best decision I have ever made.The staff was AMAZING! Always so kind and courteous. They always remembered me by my first name, and greeted me with a smile. I never had to wait in the waiting room longer than 5 minutes each time. Once I was in a chair, the assistants discussed everything with me, gave me great tips on how to keep my mouth clean and hygienic, and provided me with an extra equipment I needed free of charge. I never waited an extraneous amount of time for the orthodontist to come see me. They both a very knowledgable, have light hands, and are incredibly kind. Scheduling was SOOOO easy. With work and school, finding time to make my appointments was a huge bear. The staff really worked with me on scheduling as well as sent me reminder calls and texts for my next appointment. For all those wearing braces, MAKE SURE YOU WEAR YOUR RUBBER BANDS! Needless to say, Montano and Cardall Orthodontic Specialists will ALWAYS get a great referral from me! YOU ALL ROCK!!<//text>< pics>

I started orthodontic treatment when I was 8 years old due to a massive under bite and excessive crowding. Before my first set of braces I was really young but even then I realized that everyone's teeth were growing in straight and mine well, weren't. Set one lased about two and a half years before it was time to let the rest of my teeth grow in; sure enough they were crooked too so I came back for round two. Now, I'm very confident with my smile which rocks because I laugh a lot and having a great smile makes it that much better.
Initially, I started my treatment with Dr. Martz and when he retired he transferred all of his patients to Dr. Montano. I only had about six months left of that set but it was enough time for me to fall in love with the environment and office staff. I came back a few years later and Dr. Cardall had been added to the team; to no avail, he was just as kind as everyone else in the office. My share of time with Dr. Montano and his crew was awesome. I was comfortable and never had any trouble except for soreness but that is to be expected when your teeth are being moved. If I had to do it again I would have started round two earlier because the feeling of getting my braces off was the best feeling. I had straight teeth and no more metal, it rocked; I would never change the route I took with Dr. Montano's office, the experience was 100% worth it.</Text>

My daughter was in desperate need of orthodontic care. She had stopped smiling when being photographed and she became very self conscious about her teeth. We took her to three different offices for consultations and finally decided to go with Montano Orthodontics. I can not thank the wonderful people at Dr. Montano's office enough. From start to finish, EVERYTHING about Montano Orthodontics was perfect! We could not be happier with the results and the best part of it all, my beautiful, confident daughter loves smiling again =)< /Review>

Three of my children have seen Dr. Montano and Cardall. Could not be happier with the results. Staff is always friendly and knowledgeable. Sometimes when the adjustments were a little painful you could expect a postcard in the mail checking up on you and apologizing for the pain!! Soon we will be starting braces on our 4th child with Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall.<//text>

Not only did I have really bad teeth but Montanto also helped diagnose other breathing issues I had that doctors had never diagnosed. So because of him and doctor Cardall not only do I have better teeth they we so patient with me and my process and I’m glad I got recommended to Montano & Cardall Orthodontic.<//Text>

I had my metal braces on for a year and half a little more than expected as I wasn't fully satisfied with my teeth on what was supposed to be my last visit but the doctors were more than willing to work with me and we're not pushy to have them taken on off until I was fully satisfied. The front desk was especially great they sent me extra rubber bands if I wasn't able to come in and always accommodated me.< /Review>

My story of why I pursued orthodontic treatment:
I hated my teeth and smiling was very uncomfortable for me. I always smiled without showing my teeth. I finally wanted to do something about it. So, I searched and went around looking for a good orthodontist. Then, a family member of mine recommended Montano & Cardell Orthodontic Specialist.
Shortly after, I scheduled a consultation and they worked with me to set up a monthly payment that I could afford. All of the staff is wonderful. They're always smiling and are very friendly.
If you're out there thinking of getting braces and not sure where to go, choose Montano & Cardell Orthodontics. They really know what they are doing and love what they do.
I am so happy with my decision of going to Montano &  Cardell because I am in love with my smile. It was worth all the pain and patience. Now, I can truly live life smiling (:< /Review>

I was referred to Dr. Montano and Cardall from my dentist. After doing some research of my own and reading all the great reviews,  I knew they would be the best choice! I did not like my teeth before I had braces and never showed my teeth when I smiled. I had my braces on for about 13 months and just got them off today. I am very happy and confident  with my new smile! The experience was beyond what I expected. The staff is very friendly, happy, and always helpful. I would highly recommend Dr. Montano and Cardall Orthodontic for anyone wanting the perfect smile. :)</Review>

Took my daughter to see Dr Montano for her orthodontic care when she started jr high. over time we watched as her teeth shifted to their correct placement showing her beautiful smile.  She has now started her journey in high school and can have a beautiful and confidant smile of her own to share with others.  I”as her mother was a client of Montano’s when I was a kid. I thank my parents for taking me to see dr.montano.  a lot of his same crew work there from when I had gone to his offices for my visits. Im so glad I was able to do the same for my own child.  I do recommend to others and their families to visit if looking for ortho care.< /review>

<text>I went to Montano to have an impacted tooth fixed and to have my smile perfected. I was in college out of state at the time and had a difficult schedule. Montano was very straightforward and nice. He was very helpful answering all of our questions. During my treatment I traveled cross country studied abroad, only returning home on breaks, but they allowed me to schedule accordingly. Both Montano and Cardall are very easy to talk to. I had a great experience and now my braces are done and I am very happy with the results.I would definitely recommend this office.</text>< GmapID>

<Review>I pursued orthodontic treatment to feel more confident about my smile. Before treatment I felt uncomfortable and shy smiling around my family and friends. Dr. Montano’s long experience and high quality treatment made it easy for me to choose Montano Elevated Orthodontics over others. I feel delighted and confident about my smile now. My experience with Dr. Montano’s team will be a lifetime memory and could not have been more glad for their remarkable work. I advice others to come to Montano Elevated Orthodontics and achieve their smile of a lifetime.< /Review>< resp>

This place is amazing! From the moment we stepped into their office we were treated professionally. My son was the patient, and at 13 years old, Dr. Montano and staff made him excited about getting braces. They offer fun incentives for kids and parents that show up on time for their appointments. There are contests and drawings for both kids and parents. The office has a small arcade, is very relaxed, and comfortable. Every member of their team is caring, informed, and happy to be at work. Dr. Cardell joined the team about half-way through sons treatment and he is a perfect fit for the office. The largest surprise I had was that we were never asked to pay any additional costs. The quote we received in the beginning was exactly what we paid. And they even did little extra things for us, like filing my sons front teeth when he mentioned being self conscious about a chipped tooth. I highly recommend Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardell for any orthodontic service you need. Please don't regret your orthodontic choice, come here instead!<//text>

I have nothing but good things to say about the Doctors and staff that work here. I never had to wait long to be called back and the average time I spent in the chair was 10-20 min. THEY ARE AMAZING. I'm so glad I came to them instead or the doctor who had been working with me before I heard about Montano & Cardall.  The common areas are always well kept and they have coffee, water, and free WiFi while you wait.  They have a points system where you can earn prizes and give you a ton of free stuff. This place is great for kids. IF YOUR CHILD NEEDS BRACES COME HERE. I even received $700 in discounts to handout to friends and family at the end of my treatment.  My teeth look so much better now. Efficiency, excellence, and professionalism. They are specialists who are VERY good at what they do and know how to hire competent and kind staff. Oh, and when I got my braces off it was like a mini celebration (so funny, fun, and cool).< /text>

<Text>Coming into Montano and Cardall, I had a tremendous overbite, a little bit of a cross bite, and some really messed up teeth. In fact, my overbite was so bad every tooth was one tooth further than where they should've been. I felt embarrassed and ashamed to smile or show my teeth in public. Up until visiting Montano and Cardall, my teeth were always something I hid from everyone. I heard some great things about Montano and Cardall, and decided I'd go over to see what they could do about my teeth, because I was tired of waking up every morning and hating my teeth. From the first day I went in and still to this present day, Montano and Cardall and their staff have been nothing short of the friendliest, most caring, talented, patient, and just absolutely amazing team I have ever seen. Every time I had an appointment here, I genuinely was excited to show up because everyone treated me and cared for me so well. Walking in and saying hi to the doctors or the dental assistants or the secretaries never felt awkward, it was as if I was talking to friends I hadn't seen in a while. I have never felt so safe and trusting of a staff in any other place that practices medicine ever. Now, 2 years forward, my braces have just come off, my smile is perfect, and I am absolutely ecstatic about my teeth! It's gotten to the point where I'm feeling that I show my teeth around TOO much now, because I love them so much! I feel like a completely different person, and when I smile it fills me with confidence and joy that I had the pleasure to have been helped by only the best orthodontic team in the world. I would recommend this place 100 times out of 100 to anyone and everyone of all ages, they're easily the best orthodontic specialists available. Now, I really never write reviews online, but seeing how well Montano and Cardall made my teeth look in the end made me so amazed that I felt compelled to write a review for them. Trust me, they really work magic on your teeth and once you see how well your teeth turn out after their treatment, you'll feel like the happiest, most confident person in the world with your new smile.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

I had to have corrective jaw surgery and the amount of effort and dedication the whole office gave to give me a great experience was amazing. Each patient becomes part of a family and they devote all their energy into ensuring each person gets the smile that they deserve. I owe my smile  to Montano & Cardall Orthodonics.<//text>

Montano & Cardall was the greatest orthodontist experience of my life.  I had braces in my early teens, and like a lot of people I stopped using my retainer over time.  By the time I got into my 30s, I was no longer comfortable with the appearance of my smile, but I wasn't too excited about getting braces as an adult either!  Fortunately, the Invisalign process was super easy and pain free.  Now I am smiling more than ever.<//text>

We found out my son Jason needed braces at a regular dental appointment.  At 14 his canine teeth had not come in so the dentist took additional xrays finding he would need oral surgery to extract them and orthodontic treatment to bring the canine teeth down. We visited 3 different offices before deciding on Montano and Cardall. Each location was friendly and all had different pricing. But there was definitely a more warm welcome at Montano and Cardall. Dr. Montano took time out of his busy schedule to meet with us at the consultation and it was great to see local faces on the walls of their office showing off their smiles, post braces! Jason's treatment plan was 24 months from start to finish. Montano and Cardall's office staff are friendly and very accommodating with appointment times to work around Jason's school schedule. They were not the cheapest option, nor the most expensive option, but the right fit for us.  Thank you making my son's smile fantastic.</text>

I purchased orthodontic treatment because I wasn’t happy with my smile. I didn’t like me teeth because I had an overbite with cricket teeth. I chose Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall because I was referred to them but I was happy I was! I love my teeth now there so straight I miss my braces but I’ll get used to it. I loved the girls there they are all so nice no one was ever rude always felt welcomed especially by the Drs. Don’t wait for braces come get them done here!</review>

After taking my son to several consultations, I chose Montano & Cardall and I’m so glad that I did!
My son has a tooth that was injured when he was younger, an overbite, overjet and some overcrowding; all of these issue made it a hard decision on what office to choose. Today he got his braces off and his teeth look great! They were able to expand his bite, correct his bite and all of the teeth that out of place 😊< /Review>

From the first day I walked in everyone is so friendly and nice. The fact that they are very professional at everything and always on top of what needs to be done. The treatment is planned out for you since the beginning so you know what needs to be done. Nothing but praise for the staff and the amazing doctors!<//Text>

Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall and the staff are incredibly effective and personable. You won't find better orthodontic care anywhere. They're even among the top 1% of Invisalign providers in the country. I just finished my treatment, and I couldn't be happier with the results. The complimentary teeth whitening really brightened mine and my people's days.
Sarah and Liz are particularly pleasant.</Text>

If you are looking for an orthodontist, look no further. I was a patient of Dr. Montano as a child and since he still works as an orthodontist naturally my children would also see him. With my second child I was curious about other orthodontists so we saw a few different ones to see the difference. One local reputable orthodontist was extremely arrogant and wanted to charge us $2,000 more than other offices. They then proceeded to call constantly. Another orthodontist in town didn't even look in my child's mouth, just asked her to smile and said "yeah, she needs braces." After these experiences I was positive I have been seeing the best orthodontist in town. This was 2 years ago. My daughter just got her braces off and I couldn't be more pleased. Her smile turned out even more beautiful than I could have imagined. Dr. Cardall is genuine, warm and friendly. The orthodontist's are very skilled in their craft and continue to learn and hone their craft. The office staff is very helpful with any issues that arise with having braces such as poking wires. The office has promotions to win prizes. You are updated on progress at every appointment. My advice to those looking for an orthodontist and looking at all their options available to them is: Pick Dr. Montano and Cardall. You won't be disappointed. Your investment in yourself or your child will be worth every penny spent and more.</review>

Going into Montano and Cardall Orthodontics I really don't know what to expect. But little did I know it was a life changing experience. Their staff is very helpful and made me feel that I would be well taken care of. Everytime I would attend my appointments I would never feel scared, nervous, or dreading them. Dr. Cardall and Dr. Montano always took the time to explain the work they were going to preform on my teeth. In the 3 years I was there I never leave disappointed in my smile and I saw improvement right away. My first appointment went well and they took the time to fix every error that was made naturally in my bite. I would like to thank Montano and Cardall and their wonderful staff for giving me the smile I should've been born with.😄< /Text>

I used Montano and Cardall for my Invisalign, as they are Elite Providers (that is a top 1% provider direct from the Invisalign brand). I was very happy with the process in which their office uses and always felt well cared for. I completed a round of trays and then did a second scan for additional corrections. They made everything so easy. I am so happy with the results. Their office is also highly organized and a great environment for kids! I would highly recommend Montano and Cardall Orthodontics.</text>

The reason I pursued othodantic treatment is pretty much what everybody else pursues it for, a perfect smile. Before I had the orthodontic treatment, I was honestly embarrassed of my teeth. When I would smile for a picture I didn’t show my teeth. My family had always said that Montano and Cardall were the best orthodontists around. And les just say they weren’t wrong one bit. The way I feel about my smile now is amazing! I practically want to show off my pearly whites ALL THE TIME! I’m no longer “no teeth” smiling but smiling with the. The team treats you like family and all are very kind. The only advice I can give is to choose them!< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Montano & Cardall is a wonderful orthodontic to go to. When I first arrived there, I literally feel like I was at a hotel. The work place is so clean and welcoming to any age patient. When it's your first time there, they give you a cute little tour of the place. If you have kids, there is a small game room to entertain them. And every so often, they do cool raffles for people to participate in.

As for the employees, they have such nice attitudes to everybody. When you see them smiling, it makes you want to smile as well. Same way towards Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall. Before they check out with your progress. They always greet you by saying your name and a big smile.

As for my treatment, it was a smooth process. I used Invisalign and I LOVED IT! It's perfect for athletics because your gum won't get caught in anything. Only downside is when you have to drink something besides water. You are required to take them off before drinking anything that is not water. Overall, however, Invisalign was the best choice for me. I feel confident with my smile. Also, once you're done with your treatment, they play a small celebration song and give you a small gift.

I highly recommend it to everyone. You won't regret it at all!<//Text><Name>Catherine Pablo</Name><Resp>None<//Resp>< Date>

I really love the services my children have received from Dr. Montano's office.  My oldest child received her orthodontic treatment from Dr. Montano in 2002, and we had such a great experience that we came back to the office for my second child's ortho needs.  The staff is professional, courteous and prompt.  I highly recommend Dr. Montano to others.< /Text>

<Text>I first went to see Dr. Montano and Cardall about a year and a half ago, and I've had nothing but great experiences every time I've gone in since. I decided to go with M&C because of their excellent reputation and top of the line office/equipment. While there are some places that are cheaper, you definitely get what you pay for in regards to quality and efficiency. Both doctors are knowledgable and passionate about their craft. The staff is always very friendly and accommodating. I just got my braces off earlier today and I couldn't be happier with the results! I didn't realize at the time how much I needed braces, but now when I look back at old photos I see a huge improvement. I highly recommend Dr. Montano and Cardall.</Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Text>Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall are the best orthodontists around. They actually take the time to make sure you have the best smile around. My previous orthodontist always rushed me and I didn't like the results I was seeing. Thanks to Montano Orthodontics and the wonderful staff I now have a beautiful smile! :)<//Text>< rate>

Recently completed a treatment with Invisalign and I love the results! For many years I wasn't comfortable smiling because of my teeth but now I can't stop smiling. Dr. Montano is the best orthodontist in Bakersfield! He has also treated all three of my kids and we couldn't be happier with the results! Dr. Montano and his staff are very nice and professional. They always try their best to accommodate your schedule.< /Text>

Not only did I have really bad teeth but Montanto also helped diagnose other breathing issues I had that doctors had never diagnosed. So because of him and doctor Cardall not only do I have better teeth they we so patient with me and my process and I’m glad I got recommended to Montano & Cardall Orthodontic.</review>

Doctors Montano and Cardall are excellent! I was extremely nervous to move forward with orthodontic treatment, but once I started the process, I knew I was in great hands. Everyone in the office is very friendly, and always answered all of my questions, and eased my fears with patience. If any of my family members need orthodontic treatment in the future, we won't go anywhere but to Montano and Cardall Orthodontic Specialists.< /Text>

<Text>Montano & Cardall Orthodontic is definitely the place to go if you're looking to improve your smile. Everyone there, front to back, from the initial consultation to finish of treatment is friendly, personable, and striving to ensure that you leave with a smile after every visit. I did the Invisalign treatment for 18 months. I absolutely hated my smile before and would go out of my way to only half smile or hide it when I could. My dentist recommended Montano & Cardall, so I looked them up and read great reviews and decided I'd like to use them to transform my smile. Every appointment was smooth sailing even though I was considered a difficult case. I was dedicated to the treatment plan that the doctors put in place for me. It was easy to follow even though some weeks were tougher than others. The one misconception I think people have with Invisalign is that it won't hurt...your teeth a moving so of course it will, but the seeing that movement makes the pain worth it. You can tell that they all truly care about patient satisfaction, they're always asking how things are going or if there is any concerns you have, I appreciated that. I could not be happier with the outcome and now I smile with confidence.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I was Referred here by my Dentist and didn't think much of it. but I'm glad I went here now. I never really felt good about my teeth in general  so I opted for invisalign , and after about a year of going here , I have no regrets! . I'm practically done with my invisalign now  and love the way my teeth look and feel. the office Is neat and organized with nice and friendly staff that makes the process more enjoyable. Definitely not what I expected , you guys are Great !

The actual orthodontists are great. But this place schedules 10 weeks in advance and have too many patients so for an adult patient is impossible to get anything done. I had to reschedule twice cause i have children and work. But then i have to wait ten weeks. So instead of being done in april i wont be done till the new year! I decided to go elsewhere since they cant schedule me again until end of august for just x-rays!< /review>

<text>My daughter, Hannah, has been a patient here for just under two years. She always wanted braces because she thought her teeth were "ugly" due to the large gap she had between her top front teeth. She didn't smile much and was very self-conscious. We were referred to Montano & Cardall by a close family friend and we are so grateful! The staff has been great to work with and Drs. Montano and Cardall have been equally great! My daughter just got her braces off and she can't stop smiling. She finally feels she has a smile worth sharing!  Thank you yo everyone at Montano & Cardall for giving my daughter the smile she deserves!< /text>< Pictures>

At first I was not sure where to get treated for my teeth. I did my own research and set an consult with Montano & Cardall & what I loved about that visit is that they cared for their patience and they are very friendly so I decided to purse my orthodontic treatment with them. My experience with the team was wonderful. They cared about me and I would really recommend this orthodontic.< /text>

My experience is with Invisalign, I am very pleased with the results.  I have been going to Dr. Montano for two years and I have enjoyed his office and staff. I feel as though they are interested in helping me achieve the best possible results that I am proud of.</text>

<review>I had large spaces in my bottom teeth due to congenitally missing adult teeth and I decided it was time to do something about it.  My dentist gave me some recommendations for orthodontists.  I chose Montano and Cardall at first because of their location, and then was very impressed during my consultation appointment. Dr. Montano told me about all the people, that have been treated for the same issues as I had. I later found out that Montano and Cardall are the top 1% in the state for Invisalign care.  After 2 years of Invisalign, I am really happy with my smile. Everyone in the office is very kind and professional.  I will recommend Dr. Montano and Cardall to anyone seeking orthodontic treatment.<//review></record>

Brought my daughter here for a consultation and they were so kind and helpful, especially since we didn't have ortho on our insurance. They had a payment plan that worked for us. She had her braces on for almost 2 years and in that time they kept all appointment times and any issues were always taken care of right away. They were always friendly when we came in and made sure we knew what was going on in her treatment. I love the open feeling of the office, she even got a little disco party when her braces came off so mom's have your camera ready lol< /review>

Drs. Montano and Cardall were both so friendly. The office staff were all so helpful and the environment was wonderful. My kids were able to play in the game room and enjoyed themselves during my visit there. I was taken back to my chair right away where the staff was ready and waiting to work with me. My visit was great! I felt that I was cared for very well and couldn't have asked for better and more friendly service.< /Text>

<Review>Montano & Cardall Orthodontics have been treating my family for a very long time! First, my dad, then my uncle, and now my sister and I have had the pleasure of being treated by two very phenominal orthodontists! I had Dr. Cardall for most of my treatment and I'd say he is a perfectionist! He strived to get my teeth exactly where they should be and even though there was times I practically wanted to rip my braces off myself, I am very happy I didn't because the results are worth the wait! I personally had a great experience! The staff are very friendly and seem to genuinely care about how you are doing!  My dentist recommend I go to an orthodontist and we chose Montano because we already knew they were great. You will not be disappointed if you choose Montano and Cardall Orthodontists!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

We were referred to Montano and Cardall Orthodontics (at the time it was only Montano) by our primary dental care. It was a steady process because my teeth were stubborn in moving, but by two years & 9 months my smile was perfected. My overall experience with Montano & Cardall was amazing, they sent me a letter after every visit filled with encouragement regarding my progress. Now that my braces are off I can't stop smiling! I would recommend this dental care to anyone, there is not a smile they can not perfect.< /Review>< pictures>

I needed some orthodontic treatment to ensure that my teeth grew evenly. I was worried that my teeth would not grow evenly. I chose Dr. Montano’s office because my sister had been treated by him in the past. I can smile confidently now. Everyone at Dr. Montano’s office was nice and professional. My advice others to use Dr. Montano’s office because they are efficient and will schedule in anytime you need an adjustment.< /Text>

My son was very insecure about his smile. So we decided to get him braces. I thought about taking him to a local orthodontics but was recommended to Dr Montanos office. His office is the best with the friendliest staff. My sons smile is amazing he loves to smile and his confidence is through  the roof. I recommend Dr Montano to my friends and family. I am glad I took him to Dr Montanos office. Our visits were quick and pleasant. I give this orthodontics 5 stars for sure.< /Text>

I was really insercure about my smile && so that's why I decided to pursue my ortho treatment , my front teeth were not the best before, I had braces in the past. I decided to go to Dr.Montano and Cardall because my sister was going there and she explained how great the staff where and how she was really happy on how her teeth were looking. I had a great experience with Dr. Montano and Cardall ! I love my smile now , and I loved how they truly care about your thoughts and concerns! My advice to others is to defiantly where your rubber bands when asked to ! :)</text>

Lets start by saying that I am very excited about finally finishing up the procedure.

So I wanted to get my teeth aligned for a long time and when I was younger my parents couldn’t afford it. So it was always put off. Aside from that one of my dentists growing up said to wait until my Wisdom teeth came in so we can see if it'll improve on its own. (It didn’t).
So fast forward a lot of years and now I decided to pursue a treatment for braces but since I’m an actor I needed results fast. My sister had a treatment for 2 years and I knew people who had similar results. So I pursued Invisalign since it was supposed to be faster. I was told by one orthodontist I needed to do some jaw alignment so I was skeptical until I found Montano Elevated Orthodontics (previously Montano & Cardall).

The consultation is what had sold me because of how their results were and the high percentage of success rate. Plus I was given a 12-14 month treatment estimate so I had to say yes. Did the signing and was on board same day as my consultation. The following month I received my trays and it was the beginning to live life smiling!

Throughout the whole process Montano’s Team was awesome. They make you feel welcome the moment you walk in the office. I like their open floor concept. Nothing like a closed off space to put nerves on you.

After the whole process, which literally was only 12-months, Im very happy with my smile. My family and friends love it. I was always smiling even before the treatment and I will continue smiling after like I always am.

My advice for any future patient you gotta live life smiling. Visit Montano for your orthodontic needs. You will not regret it I promise you!

Before I came to Montano and Cardall, my teeth were in bad shape. They were over lapping and very crooked. With in months they were pretty straight but as time went on they became perfect. They've really done a great job and i'm really glad i came here. My teeth look amazing and my bite is perfect. Thank you Montano and Cardall for everything you've done for me!<//review>

< Review>
Since the moment I attended the initial exam, I knew this was the place I wanted for my treatment. The staff and doctors were knowledgeable and answered my questions so as to have all the information. I felt confident in my decision to use Invisalign instead of traditional braces since both processes were explained. Also, the equipment and technology available for use is the best. I had Invisalign for close to a year and love the results. My treatment did not require extensive correction, but that did not stop the doctors from giving me the best treatment possible. I feel confident in my smile now, and it was due to the great care and attention to the details. I would highly recommend Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall to others.<//Review>

<Review>I had two children as patients at Montanio and Cardall, and not only was each visit fast but my little one who is not yet a patient had a fun time their and we were all treated like family!!
I love the work they did from my fist child who had just a little tweaking to do to my second child who had major work to be done, nothing is to being or small for this office.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

My son says he's a very kind and skilled orthodontist.  He made it very easy and not scary when my son (10) had to have braces.  Thanks, Dr. Montano!</Review>

When I first walked in I felt so scared my stomach dropped and I was speechless. It didn't look bad if anything it exceeded my expectations. When the staff called my name to get my x-ray I almost couldn't move but I had to do what I had to do. After that when they showed me around i was shook. I pictured that there would be a hallway that leads to a bunch of rooms and I would have to stay in one and wait for someone to come. Instead it was a open room with chairs lined up next to each other in a slight arch. Even though I didn't know the kid next to me I still felt safe, knowing that they were going through the same things as I did. I highly recommend Montano and Cardell to people cause the staff and doctors are very nice.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377</GmapID></record>

Once I got my adult teeth in, my teeth became crooked. I used to feel embarrassed and uncomfortable to smile with my teeth. I choose Dr. Montano & Dr. Cardall because A few of my friends went there to get braces and gave me good reviews.  Once going there they recommended me with Invisalign and today was the day I got them off. Now, I feel like I could smile all day and perfectly comfortable with my teeth. The staff was incredible they made me feel like I was at home. I believe people should go here in order to get the best smile possible.< /text>

Best in Bakersfield. These doctors had zero hesitation designing the appropriate treatment that was started for my children in Fresno. Life happens. We moved to bakersfield mid treatment. I have full confidence in this office and both doctors. Clean, modern, respectful atmosphere that is efficient and doesn't waste anyone's time. They are very professional and responsible ethical businessmen in the Bakersfield area. I love both the smiling docs, as do my children. Today was braces off and my daughter who was once teased for her rabbit teeth now has a smile that befitting the princess she truly is. Thank you both doctors.< /text>

I’m so lucky to have heard about montano and cardall I couldn’t be any happier with my finished results! I love my smile and can not stop smiling.

I have taken three of my five children to Dr Montano and Cardall's office.  I love this place!  The staff is very friendly and the Drs. Really know their stuff.  I recommend this place to everyone.  My older two girls went somewhere else and it was such an unpleasant experience that I will only come to Dr Montano and Cardall.< /text>

I would definitely recommend this orthodontic to relatives and friends. Great treatment in a short amount of time. There was never a problem rescheduling an appointment, and no problem fitting the appointment into my busy schedule. I was embarrassed to smile or to even show my teeth at all, but Montano & Cardall Orthodontic's invisalign fixed me up in no time! I am not afraid to show off my straight teeth, and my beautiful smile, as what their staff told me. The friendly staff at this orthodontic are always positive, and made sure you were comfortable before doing any work. Once again, I am very satisfied with the results from, which i feel, is the best orthodontic in Bakersfield.< /text>

Three of my children have seen Dr. Montano and Cardall. Could not be happier with the results. Staff is always friendly and knowledgeable. Sometimes when the adjustments were a little painful you could expect a postcard in the mail checking up on you and apologizing for the pain!! Soon we will be starting braces on our 4th child with Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall.</Text>

<review>When I first came to Dr. Montano’s office I hated my smile. They were crooked and I had crowding so I definitely started this process with insecurities about my smile. I had always heard good things about Dr. Montano’s office and staff so his office was definitely our first choice. After a little over 2 years I finally have straight teeth! Since I began my treatment, both my little brother and my little sister have also began receiving treatment from him. Safe to say he’s a family favorite!  The staff has always been so friendly and extremely helpful. They definitely have made this whole process easy, I’m so glad I chose Dr. Montano’s office and I highly recommend him to everyone (whether you’re an adult or a child)!< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>My name is Pahola  and here is my story. No matter how much I said I didn't care about my looks, I always felt shameful of my smile. I always kept my mouth shut when I smile. I finally decided to received orthodontic treatment because I wanted a changed in my smile. I wanted to feel confident in my smile especially if I wanted to impress someone. I heard about Dr. Montano and Dr.Casrdall through smile for a lifetime foundation. I heard they were the best of the best. I decided to see for myself how good Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall were. I personally don’t like going to any orthodontist dentist but I have to admit I had one of the most fun and best treatment with Dr. Montano and Dr.Cardall. I still remember the first day I walk in , the front desk lady greeted me very cheerful and warmly with a wide smile. She quickly check me in and while I waited for them to call me  she inform me about a game room :) I didn’t wait for long before they call me in. They inform me step by step of the process of my treatment. They ensure me that by the end of my treatment I was going to have a beautiful smile and I believed in them. They took their job very serious which made me fell more calm and at ease. Thank you Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall it was a pleasant experience. I am grateful to have chosen Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall as my orthodontist specialist.</Text><Rate>5< /Rate><username>Pao_o<//username></record>

I've always been self conscious about my smile so I decided it was time I look into getting braces.  I chose Montano & Cardall as they are very well known here in town and I have heard nothing but good things about them.  His entire staff is knowledgeable, professional and very welcoming.  During my initial consultation they went over the pros and cons of both Invisalign and metal/ceramic braces and answered any questions I had.  They take the time to educate you and also make sure they have a clear understanding of what exactly you are looking to achieve.  They understand your time is just as important as theirs and I love that I never have to wait long.  If you run into a problem they are always willing to help (there were several times my Invisalign trays were sharp in certain areas and they would always squeeze me into their schedule to make sure I was taken care of and comfortable).  A year and a half later, I am smiling more now than I ever have.  My daughter is 9 and currently a patient here as well and actually looks forward to her appointments as they have a game room for children and are always doing some sort of raffle/give away.  If you are looking for orthodontic treatment, look no further.  I highly recommend them!</Text>

< Review>
I really enjoyed my experience at Montano & Cardall Orthodontic. My family has gone through Montano since the 90s and his work is still excellent. It was nice to see a young Orthodontic such as Cardall take such pride in his work. They didn't hesitate to make sure my teeth were perfect when I got them off. Any problems I had they were right on top of it making sure I was takin care of and my braces were back to normal. I'm extremely happy with my smile, so I think its time to go be a model. lol</Review>

I knew along the way braces were going to be a necessity so I looked around and came across Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialist from the start the staff the environment and knowledge they had was what made me feel like I made the right choice.I had reconstructive jaw surgery and had braces on for that as well no mater what every step of the way they were there making sure everything was perfect from the moment I got my braces till the moment I got them off. Victoria Hipsher an employee there no matter what always worked on my teeth and did great and no matter how sensitive I was after surgery or before she was perfect she was gentle and would never would rush. Her work ethic and personality are what made me even more excited for my appointments because I was always afraid of the dentist etc.. but she changed that for me and can for you TRUST ME!!!!. Now having my braces removed I'm in love with my smile they did a fantastic job. If your looking around Montano & Cardall are the people to see they will give you the best of the best. Choosing them was a no brainer all my questions, concerns and advice they were able to give to me Thank You Montano & Cardall also Victoria for my smile I can't thank you enough....</Text>

People told me I had a pretty smile already, but I wanted to see it myself as well. I heard nothing but good reviews, and my co-worker recommended that I see the Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists. I met with the team and was very impressed by the success pictures they portray around the office. I have had my braces for 2-1/2 years and I love my smile now. The team was always nice, and dealt with every concern I had. I extremely reccomend the Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists because you will love your surroundings, outcome of everything, and family feeling.<//Text>< Response>

<Review>I was referred to this office by many happy customers and my dentist.  They did a great job with the Invisalign.  The office staff is amazing .     We are so happy with the final results.  My son cannot stop smiling now that he is done.    The invisiline was a great experience it took 18 months. I couldn't believe how quick the process was. Both Cardall and Montano took their time with each patient and were very friendly.   Thank you for all the staffs help through each process .</Review>< pics>

Hands down a great experience.  The Dr.'s at Montano and Cardall are very kind and extremely knowledgable when in comes to orthodontics.  I have been with this office for over 7 years with my three children.  All three kids required different types of ortho services and this office was able to accommodate them all.  The staff employed are all very sweet and professional each and every visit.  We have even had wonderful service after normal business hours with a regular employee who knows our kids.  I would and do recommend this office for any and all orthodontic service needs.  Thanks for being such a great part of our family for so many years.< /review>

I went to Dr Montano 20 years ago and got braces. Wore them for FOUR long years. Lost my retainer and over the years my teeth got worse. Now fast forward 20 years and Dr M had me in Invisalign for only 8 short months and now my teeth are perfect again! And I'm getting a permanent retainer so no more losing it!! Office visits were always short and sweet. Great experience.</Review>

Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall made my wish come true. I had severe crowding on bottom teeth and my top canine tooth was high up which was pretty noticeable when I smiled and for me that was quite embarrassing. I am a person who loves to smile so when it came to pictures I had to close my mouth and when I laughed I would cover my mouth.
One day I was determined to get braces because I was tired of having to hide my smile. I googled the best orthodontic places in Bakersfield and Montano and Cardall popped up. I read the reviews and I immediately knew this place was it. When I showed up for my exam they showed me around and I felt wanted in there. All the staff is so nice and helpful and not to mention how nice the office is.
When my braces came off I was the happiest. I couldn't believe how straight my teeth were. There are no words to describe how content I am with my teeth. I cannot stop smiling because they look great. My friends and coworkers have given me so many compliments. It's just a great feeling.
Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall really are the BEST! I cannot thank them enough for giving me the perfectly aligned teeth I always dreamed of.
For anyone who is looking for ortho treatment I 10/10 recommend Dr. Montano and Cardall.
Thanks to them I will definitely Live Life Smiling<//Text>

<text>Where do I even begin?! First of all I want to say that  Dr. Montano & his team are AWESOME...It took me a long time to decide where to begin my journey to a better smile. I had always been very self conscious about my diastema (GAP) and my smile but I am beyond glad I decided to start my Invisalign journey with Dr. Montano... He is by far one of the best orthodontist in town! I am not even half way through my treatment and I can already see just how much my smile has changed. I want to thank Dr. Montano & his team for helping me get the beautiful smile I have always wanted. I truly recommend anyone looking to start Invisalign/ traditional braces to come to Dr. Montano he will not disappoint! Let’s just say I have learned to live life smiling! & I can’t wait to see the end result.<//text><Time>1555995991335< /Time>< UserId.>

My son has been going to Doctor Montano and Cardall for about a year and a half now and he just got his braces off yesterday!” can I get a WOOP! WOOP!” We both are completely satisfied how his teeth turned out. Before his braces, he had an overbite and many gaps. He can’t stop smiling, he has beautiful straight teeth now. Doctor Montano and Cardall have done an AMAZING job! Everyone in the office is nice is super friendly, and make you fill welcome at all times. We never had to wait more than 15 minutes to seen. If you are looking for great orthodontists go to Montano and Cardall Orthodontic you won't regret it, I promise!<//text>

Everyone was very kind and helpful in the office and appointments always ran smooth. They work with you to make a great treatment plan and keep it affordable for everyone. I would highly recommend them to anyone and everyone.< /review>

I wanted to pursue orthodontic treatment because I was always self conscious about my smile. All throughout my younger years in school I would get made fun of due to my crooked teeth. I hated them, and although my parents would tell me that my teeth didn't define me, society had me convinced it did. I decided to choose Dr. Montano & Dr. Cardall because i liked how friendly the staff was & the doctors themselves were also very nice. I feel so much better about my smile now that I had gotten braces, it has definitely boosted my confidence level x1000. My experience with your team was beyond amazing! Everytime i had an appointment the staff was very helpful with reminding me my appointments a day in advanced, and always being polite and having a smile on their face when greeting me everytime I would come in. My advice to others is that if you're ever self conscious about anything and decide to make a change, do it for you. Don't let society be in control and now a days that is very hard. I just want to thank the Montano & Cardall staff for everything they've done for me the past 3 years & I wouldn't want to have it any other way! Thank you so much!</review>

I highly recommend anyone needing braces to go see Dr Montano and Cardall. The staff is amazing, everyone is so nice, happy and always has a smile. I never had a problem making an appt and when my apot came i never had to wait to be seen. They text you the day before to remind you which is wonderful they have an awesome payment plan and they even have a points program for the kids to get prizes. The work they do is amazing so if you want a pretty smile this us the place to go.
Thank you Dr Montano , Dr Cardall, and staff you truely are the best.</Text>

I always hated the way my smiled looked, and it took me along time to finally decide to do orthodontic treatment, I went to a few places for consultations and they all had different things to say, some said they had to pull 4 teeth or 3 so that made me think that maybe I don’t want them, that how would I look without 4 teeth and who knows how long it would take to fill the gap, then I heard of montano and Cardall from a friend and when I went for a consultation it felt right, all they said was I’d have to remove 1 tooth and that too in the back so it wasn’t going to show, the way they walked thru everything and explained how long the process can take made it so much easier to go with them, the team is very nice and friendly and I would totally recommend montano and Cardall<//Text>

I had 3 kids get braces here over the last 5 years and every time it was wonderful! One was a thumb sucker, the second grew 5 inches in 2 years and the jaw line was out of wack. The third has 5 missing Permanent teeth.  So it wasn’t just for CROOKED teeth. My kids teeth look great, so glad I chose montano and cardall ❤️</review>

I found Montano and Cardall when searching for invisalign providers in the area. I had a couple gaps in teeth i was looking to fix, and I didn't want to get braces. They had amazing reviews and lots of experience with invisalign (one of two diamond plus providers in the area), as well as the iTero scanning system. It's been a great experience with them. My teeth look great, the duration of treatment was about what was estimated, and pricing was upfront. They were great with working with me on appointments and rescheduling. The staff and office are amazing as well.<//Text>

My experience with Montano-Cardall Orthodontics was exceptional!  Their office is clean, welcoming, and comfortable and their equipment and technology is state-of-the-art.  The office staff and dental assistants are amazing! They’re kind, caring, and knowledgeable.  They always remembered my name, greeted me warmly at each visit, and chit-chatted personably during down times.  I even received hand-written notes in the mail occasionally from them!  They were also affectionate and understanding when my treatment was uncomfortable.  During my time there, Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall proved to be skillful and competent orthodontists.  My case was extremely complicated and required very specific treatment and ultimately jaw surgery.  My upper and lower teeth didn’t line up or meet correctly and caused a major shift that made it very difficult to eat, talk, and even smile.  I was also terribly self-conscious because my face was visibly “crooked.”  Dr. Montano was confident that he could fix it though!  He recommended and worked closely with an amazing oral surgeon, and together they built for me a functional bite and beautiful smile!  There were several orthodontic challenges that Dr. Montano faced along the way, but he persevered and problem solved through them every time.  I was so impressed with his talent and ability, and so pleased with the end result!  Being their patient has been a life changing experience and one of the best decisions I’ve ever made!  I couldn’t be happier with my experience at Montano-Cardall Orthodontics!

<user_name>Lupe Castillo<//user_name><review>We chose Montano & Cardall Orthodontic because of a family friend Jacob Merrick which everyone there knows, we knew our 3 children would need braces & their low payments were very convenient for us, we had taken our children where our dentist had recommended us but it was not as clean as Montano's office, their staff were as nice but Montano's came very highly recommended, we would use Montano & Cardall if in the future with our family's need. My children love their smile now, thank you guys, it's been about 3 years now between all 3 kids but we are very satisfied.< /review><Rating>5<//Rating>< time>

For 25ish years I had a really bad under bite. After close to 3 years of  Invisalign and a gruesome surgery(I was a pumpkin head for a couple weeks), I'm finally comfortable with my smile. Before, i would never be able to smile with teeth. Now I can. It was a long and expensive process but it was totally worth it. Both Montano and Cardall are really nice and patient. They explain every process and step if you want to know. It was a wonderful experience.<//review>

<Review>Having a rare open bite I was hesitant to get involved in a fairly new corrective trial. Yet, in under two years I have seen dramatic changes and at this point I couldn't be more pleased with my choice to continue with the new trial instead of my alternate option, surgery.< /Review>< pictures>

My daughter was in desperate need of orthodontic care. She had stopped smiling when being photographed and she became very self conscious about her teeth. We took her to three different offices for consultations and finally decided to go with Montano Orthodontics. I can not thank the wonderful people at Dr. Montano's office enough. From start to finish, EVERYTHING about Montano Orthodontics was perfect! We could not be happier with the results and the best part of it all, my beautiful, confident daughter loves smiling again =)<//Review>

My teeth weren't so bad, but I wanted them straight. I had a boyfriend at the time, who's niece was going to get the metal braces. She was frightened, so I'd thought to get the metal braces right along with her so she can have someone to relate to. I was referred to Montano and Cardall by a co-worker of mine, and it is the best decision I have ever made.The staff was AMAZING! Always so kind and courteous. They always remembered me by my first name, and greeted me with a smile. I never had to wait in the waiting room longer than 5 minutes each time. Once I was in a chair, the assistants discussed everything with me, gave me great tips on how to keep my mouth clean and hygienic, and provided me with an extra equipment I needed free of charge. I never waited an extraneous amount of time for the orthodontist to come see me. They both a very knowledgable, have light hands, and are incredibly kind. Scheduling was SOOOO easy. With work and school, finding time to make my appointments was a huge bear. The staff really worked with me on scheduling as well as sent me reminder calls and texts for my next appointment. For all those wearing braces, MAKE SURE YOU WEAR YOUR RUBBER BANDS! Needless to say, Montano and Cardall Orthodontic Specialists will ALWAYS get a great referral from me! YOU ALL ROCK!!</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I never smiled and I never wanted to take pictures . I knew my teeth needed help and I needed to do something about it. My teeth before were crooked and probably the most embarrassing feature about myself . I was so ashamed of my own smile . I chose montano and cardall because of their wonderful ratings and also their smile for a lifetime foundation program . My family wasn’t well off and I wasn’t working yet and I really needed to get braces. Without their program it never would’ve happened . Today I feel absolutely stunning in my own smile. My smile is more beautiful than I could of ever imagined . I never thought my teeth could possibly look this great and be this straight . The team at montano and cardalls office are outstanding !!! They are the most friendliest people you could meet and always take great care of me . I never left unsatisfied . They are the best staff of doctors I have ever come across . I am so happy with their treatment . My advice for others is to not wait to long ! Get braces at a young age and always BRUSH AND FLOSS . Also , braces are going to hurt and take time , but the outcome is more than you could ever wish for .</text></record>

<Review>I cannot say enough great things about this office! We just finished treatment with my 2nd child and have a 3rd child currently in braces. We have ended up with beautiful smiles and couldn't be happier! The staff here are friendly and knowledgeable and the drs are so welcoming and happy to answer any questions about treatment. There are plenty of seats in the waiting room and there are many seats in the treatment room where you can sit nearby and watch what's going on with your child! The office offers many incentives and prizes along the way to keep patients motivated to care for their teeth and braces in the correct way during treatment! There are no hidden costs or extra charges. What you are quoted at the beginning of treatment is what you pay even if treatment ends up being longer than expected! I highly recommend this office!

Update- my daughter and 3rd child just got her braces off and her teeth look fantastic! Montano orthodontics continue to create beautiful smiles. Happy customer over here!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Rating>5<//Rating><UserId.>115010691209823016939<//UserId.>< resp>

<Text>Brought my daughter in for a consultation. Was advised of what needed to be done and went over finances. Narce explained to me that they would have to submit for the approval from the dental insurance company. Narce explained it can take 3-4 weeks to get a response. Okay great. My daughter kept bugging me if I heard from the orthodontist office about the approval. Since I hadnt I figured I would call the dental insurance company. This was on Tuesday morning. Insurance advised that it was approved and sent back. I called and advised this and asked to speak to Narce. At that time I was advised she wasnt available and that their fax toner was out so they hadnt received anything as lf yet but she would have Narce call me back. Nothing. No phone call. Called wednesday, thursday, and friday. Wednesday and thursday i was told same thing that Narce wasnt available but they would make sure she called me back that day. Still nothing either day. Today i called and was advised no one was in the office, that they were only there to take phone calls. It is unprofessional to not return phone calls to potential customers.
I never thought I would have this experience at your office since i was a paitent before and had nothing but goof experiences. Now, i have to wait until monday and hope that i get a phone call back.
Hopefully i can update my review and change my rating for better.

Thank you Dr. Cardall and Narce for your due diligence to find out what was going on. Narce, thank you for taking time out of your day when you are off to give me a call to explain what happened. Thank you again! So glad i could update my rating.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

From my first consultation, to when I had my last Invisalign tray, Montano and Cardall orthodontics has been nothing other than great!  The whole staff is friendly and polite.  I'm always seen very promptly after checking in for my appointment.

Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall both worked on my case and they were both very knowledgable and enthusiastic with my progress.  I couldn't have asked for a better experience with Invisalign.  I definitely recommend them to anyone in the market for braces or Invisalign.< /review>

<time>1524156166679< /time><rate>5< /rate><text>I knew from the start that I wanted invisalign, so I set out and did my research.  I was concerned because I have a bridge, and some receding gum issues. I had three total consultations, and ultimately chose Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists.  Not only because they are rated the top 1% provider of invisalign, but because Dr. Montano was confident that he could address all my orthodontic needs, (severe protrusion of front teeth, and an excessive overlap of the upper teeth over the lower teeth, with both the upper and lower teeth shifted to the right, and both have crowding) with invisalign.  He also showed me a before and after of someone with issues similar to mine, only they were worse off because they had gone to someone who was less qualified and ended  up making their problem worse.  Montano & Cardall were able to give said patient a great smile - I was sold.  After 42 aligners, (being changed out every week), my smile is perfect!  At Montano & Cardell, they deliver!<//text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

My husband, 2 sons & nephew all had braces & Invisilign done by Dr. Montano & Cardall. We have been so happy with the results we recommend them to everyone. My husband was reluctant to get Invisilign but after his treatment his teeth are beautiful & it cured his TMJ. The staff are amazing & we never had to wait when we came in for appointments. I loved how quickly they got patients in & out.  I am the last one in the family to get my teeth straightened & I will definitely be going to Montana & Cardall, they are great at what they do & they're a pleasure to work with.  I highly recommend them.< /Text>

<Text>I have been going to Montano and Cardall for a little over a year and a half, my experience has always been excellent from beginning to end. I just today finished my Invisalign journey and couldn't be happier with the outcome my smile looks and feels amazing! Definitely a good place for invisalign with top of line technology. Both doctors are very knowledgable, treat you with great care and are quick to answer any questions. Their staff is very professional also and make you feel comfortable, everyone is helpful and friendly. Their team was very punctual on all of my appointments which is excellent. I highly recommend Montano & Cardall Orthodontics to anyone seeking to perfect their smile their work is great you won't leave disappointed.

My experience at Montano & Cardel was pretty good. I went through 2 phases of braces, for a total of 4 years.  I was 8 years old when I first got them on. The staff was always nice and welcoming. Anytime I had something wrong or a wire poked me, they always made sure I was happy and had no discomfort. If I did have discomfort, they would give me gift cards to Dewars...that was pretty SWEET! There were times the staff would call me after an appointment to make sure I was feeling ok. That always made me happy. My mom & Dad really liked everyone too because they always explained everything to them and they say it was affordable.   At 13 years old, I finally got my braces off and I love how My teeth look!</Text>

I could say my son has a very poor teeth in the beginning, and today, one of the most accomplished day for my son's life, because this is the day that they removed the braces after almost 2 years. And the result was more than excellent. They fixed it in the most appropriate way. That is why we love Ortho dentist.
Let's talk about the staff; they are so efficient, helpful, and gentle on their work. The most important thing, if my son had a problem with his brace, the scheduler accommodated us in the most convenient way. Two thumbs up for that. I trust no one but Dr Montano and Cardall for Ortho Dental works. Well recommended. Thank you and God bless on your business.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<rate>5<//rate><review>My story of why I pursued orthodontic treatment:
I hated my teeth and smiling was very uncomfortable for me. I always smiled without showing my teeth. I finally wanted to do something about it. So, I searched and went around looking for a good orthodontist. Then, a family member of mine recommended Montano & Cardell Orthodontic Specialist.
Shortly after, I scheduled a consultation and they worked with me to set up a monthly payment that I could afford. All of the staff is wonderful. They're always smiling and are very friendly.
If you're out there thinking of getting braces and not sure where to go, choose Montano & Cardell Orthodontics. They really know what they are doing and love what they do.
I am so happy with my decision of going to Montano &  Cardell because I am in love with my smile. It was worth all the pain and patience. Now, I can truly live life smiling (:<//review>< Pics>

Montano and Cardell are great at what they do, and are very caring with each individual who comes in. I pursued treatment because like everyone I wanted straight teeth. I never felt confident with the teeth I had before, and my sister also went through their treatment and her teeth came out amazing. I chose Drs. Montano and Cardell because I too wanted those amazing results. Them and their staff took great care of me, and I couldn't be happier with the results. I'm so amazed with my new smile, I feel like a new me. My advice for others is to start young because it makes the person's whole development of growth easier. I wouldn't want to go to anyone else.</review>

My daughters perspective: I pursued orthodontic treatment because I felt that my teeth were dreadful, not only did they look but they also felt horrendous. Anytime I smiled or talked, I felt like no one was paying attention to me. It made me feel like people only focused on how dreadful my teeth appeared. I felt ashamed to be so young with a ghastly smile; they were unappealing to anyone who saw my widely gaped, crocked teeth, and an unscrupulous overbite. I chose Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall because when we first walked in for the initial consultation, the staff greeted us with great service and the doctors were very knowledgeable and qualified to take care of my teeth. We chose to stay there because of the wonderful experiences like: free costume parties at Rollerama, earning points for cool prizes, and a BODACIOUS game room. It turned out to be an astounding experience. They fixed my teeth within two years and now I'm confident about my smile. Since getting my braces off, it has boosted my ego and now I feel great talking to people. I'm not embarrassed to talk or smile! I had fun and enjoyed going to all my appointments and seeing the same welcoming faces. My advice to my future BRACEFACES' is to have patience with the process of getting/having braces. Even though it seems like a long journey; however, it's worth gaining self-assurance. After the journey, you will join a secret society of people with impeccable smiles!<//text>

Montano's office and staff are fantastic and make you feel welcomed and valued every step of the way.  While their services may seem costly compared to other offices, you definitely get what you pay for, and that is evident in every aspect of their business.  In addition to the first rate orthodontic service itself, their office offers the little amenities that may seem trivial to some, but mean a lot to someone who enjoys great service.  These include: coffee, citrus infused water, wifi, arcade room for the kids, amongst other things.  Most importantly, after my son's treatment, I am certain they can take on the most difficult of orthodontic problems.  I am absolutely satisfied with my investment, both with my treatment and my son's.  If you are considering orthodontic treatment, there is no question that Dr. Montano's office is the best choice in Bakersfield.</review>< Response>

<Time>1449690935273<//Time><Rate>5< /Rate><review>Getting my teeth straightened using the Invisalign method at Drs Montano and Cardall was the best gift I have ever given myself.  The procedure was a lot easier than I expected.  And now I hear it is even easier because you won't have to have molds taken of your teeth to create the Invisalign retainers.

I could see the alignment of my teeth change quickly.  I no longer try to keep my lips together when I smile!  When I look back at pictures of myself before the alignment, I can't believe how much improved my smile looks.

You are never too old to get this done - I was in my 50s.  The staff at Montano & Cardall Orthodontic make the whole process very pleasant and enjoyable.< /review>< Pictures>

Dr Montano and Dr Cardell are awesome Orthodontics. The whole staff was always attentive and very welcoming as soon as you came into the office. My daughter Gabriella Perez loved going into the office cause she never had to wait long, unlike other offices.  I would highly recommend Dr Montano and Dr Cardell. Thank you soooo much for her beautiful smile.< /Text>

After two and a half years of having braces i finally got them off today. When i first got them on my smile was horrible my teeth were extremely crooked. I choose Dr. Montano& Cardall because Dr. motano had put braces on my brother in the past and he had great reviews. They also have the best and nicest people working there. I honestly didn't hate going there because of how nice and talkative the people who work there are. Before I hated my smile and never wanted to show my teeth. But now i'm excited to show off my new and straight teeth. I appreciate all the hard work and effort they put in my teeth. Thank you so my Dr Motano & Cardall!</Text>

I loved every thing about this office and everything that they do. Every single person that works here is always very polite and helpful in situations and making sure I did what I was supposed to. They never got mad at me for breaking all of the herbst appliances that I had for a few months and that was a stress reliever haha. The office is always super clean and they gave me the best smile I could ask for and I'm so thankful for that! You guys are by far the best office that anybody could ever go to have braces! I will defenitely show off my smile to everybody and tell people about you guys! Thank you again for everything!!!< /review>

Dr. Montano is the best orthodontic doctor in Bakersfield CA.  He has done an amazing job creating my smile with the help of Dr. Cardall and Dr. Relle.  Whether you are a child or an adult, his stellar team will be there every step of the way.  Dr. Montano and his team have become family.  I definitely would recommend anyone for his services.  I am very grateful and proud to say that he is my Dr. of choice.  There should be more stars to give Dr. Montano.

With all the love and respect,

I started orthodontic treatment when I was 8 years old due to a massive under bite and excessive crowding. Before my first set of braces I was really young but even then I realized that everyone's teeth were growing in straight and mine well, weren't. Set one lased about two and a half years before it was time to let the rest of my teeth grow in; sure enough they were crooked too so I came back for round two. Now, I'm very confident with my smile which rocks because I laugh a lot and having a great smile makes it that much better.
Initially, I started my treatment with Dr. Martz and when he retired he transferred all of his patients to Dr. Montano. I only had about six months left of that set but it was enough time for me to fall in love with the environment and office staff. I came back a few years later and Dr. Cardall had been added to the team; to no avail, he was just as kind as everyone else in the office. My share of time with Dr. Montano and his crew was awesome. I was comfortable and never had any trouble except for soreness but that is to be expected when your teeth are being moved. If I had to do it again I would have started round two earlier because the feeling of getting my braces off was the best feeling. I had straight teeth and no more metal, it rocked; I would never change the route I took with Dr. Montano's office, the experience was 100% worth it.</text>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>When I was in fifth grade, my mom took me in to see Dr. Montano. My teeth weren’t hideous, but my smile closely resembled Goofy’s. My older brother already had braces, and I thought it was the neatest thing that he got to choose colors to put onto his brackets. I had my braces on for a little over a year, and it was a relatively pain-free experience. Of course, getting wires tightened and teeth molded wasn’t enjoyable, but the staff at Dr. Montano’s was always helpful and kind. Also, the points that patients earned towards prizes was always exciting. Now, I am not afraid to share my smile with everyone. I advise whoever is interested in a nicer smile to come here; definitely worth it!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I got my first set of braces from an orthodontist in Encinitas, and the braces themselves did what they were supposed to. When I moved to Bakersfield and switched to Montano & Cardall Orthodntics, there was an obvious upgrade in not just the braces themselves, but in the care and professionalism in the workplace. The orientation offered to me when I walked in with my dad my first day there made it very easy for me to forget about my aversion towards doctor appointments. I've been treated by Dr. Montano for a few years and he makes the process of having braces very easy to understand-- even for someone with previously zero knowledge of orthodontia. Walking into the office, I'm always greeted warmly by whoever was at the front desk, and when I'm seated, whoever happened to be working with me that day always made an effort to make me feel at east. After a few appointments, that wasn't even necessary anymore; I'd walk in confident that I'd be receiving the best care possible. I was initially very worried that I'd be stuck wearing braces for a very long time because of my existing facial deformity, but I just recently had my braces removed and I've never felt more confident and happy with myself. I owe a lot of my newfound confidence to Dr. Montano and the team. I would highly recommend switching here for your orthodontic care if you haven't already.<//text>

<Text>My experience w/Montano & Crandall Orthodontic was amazing. They answer all your questions & any concerns  you may have. They know how to take care of their patients/clients the minute you walk in to there office. The staff there are fantastic and beautiful from the inside & out.  My daughter felt very comfortable & most of all not scared. Now she cannot stop smiling. She has a beautiful smile.  I WILL highly recommend my family & friends  to Montano & Crandall Orthodontic.  #KEEPUPTHEGOODWORK<//Text>< pics>

I had the best experience here. I had braces when I was in high school.  Almost 12 years later I started to get a snaggle tooth ( or that's how I saw it). I began to not want to smile and it was very noticeable in pics. I got Invisalign at Montano Orthodontics and could not be more happy with the results.  The staff is incredibly professional and sincerely sweet. Dr. Cardall was a fantastic addition to this office! I have already recommended them to friends and family and would encourage anyone needing braces to check them out.<//Review>

This will be my second time coming to dr. montano .my 1st time was when I was younger to correct my over bite and Put braces on.This time around it was because of baby teeth being pulled and having the adult teeth missing . I had started my braces at another doctors out of town . When I moved back montano was able to take over . The staff is awesome  and always willing to answer any questions I had as well as explaining what was going on that day . They offer up drawing for the kids and Many other thing to make it friendly and fun . This place is not only for kids but adults too. Iwould not hesitate to take my kids here in the future .Thank you guys you are awesome< /Review>

<review>When I first decided to get braces I immediately knew I wanted to get my consultation with Dr. Montano (before I knew he had collaborated with Dr. Cardall). I had the advantage of Dr. Montano's amazing work because my brother had gone to Dr. Montano many years ago, when he was off of the Stockdale location. On the up side I also had my niece that had just received her invisalign procedure months before I decided I even wanted braces or even invisalign. Anyways, I went for my free consultation and found out I had way more work on my teeth than what I had even been aware of. I was a bit distraught being told I needed braces because my teeth were way more messed up than what I knew. Deep down I truly wanted invisalign but unfortunately I wasn't a candidate for them. I eventually decided to fix my imperfect smile with Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall; knowing what I know now about them, it was the best decision and investment I had ever done. Weeks after weeks, I knew exactly what was going to be my procedure and be aware of what I needed to do in order for me to be successful in my journey. The staff was outstanding, I did have one staff member that would unintentionally forget about cutting my wire every time I got my braces tighten, other than that she was just as great as any other staff. EVERYONE was beyond friendly and too kind. Any question or concern I had they were always there to clarify it all. Now Dr. Montano and Cardall they were two impeccable Dr's. that genuinely love their career. They are truthfully the best orthodontic Dr's. I never write reviews but for Dr. Montano, Dr. Cardall, and staff I definitely will! Thank you so much Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall for all the work you've done to perfect now my imperfectly smile before!!</review>< Pics>

My experience with Montano & Cardall Orthodotics Specialists was amazing. I have never met a very welcoming and nice team like team. Before I got braces I have to say my teeth were not in the condition. I didn't like to smile at all especially I didn't like showin my teeth. My aunt kept telling me if I wasn't happy that I should go get checked to see if I needed braces. At first I was nervous but the people there were so loving and caring. That is when I knew this was the place. I had my braces on for 2 years and after I got them off I was relieved but happy because I was in ove with my smile. As soon as I got them off I couldn't stop smiling. If you think you need braces go get checked because if you do need them after you get them off you won't regret it. Throughout everything Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists have  been ver nice and helped me get a better smile.< /text>

Quality Excellent
We chose Dr. Montano as our children's orthodontist. We have been so pleased with the excellent care that both of our boys, and our daughter have received at Montano Orthodontics for the past 4 1/2 years. We really feel like the office staff are more like family to us. We have received exceptional care and follow up. We have been so pleased with the addition of Dr. Cardall with Dr. Montano, and feel he has also provided us with exceptional care. Whenever we had a problem, we were always able to be seen ASAP to fix a broken bracket or to fix a wire. The treatment my children received produced some beautiful straight teeth and a great smile. Our daughter has been monitored since she was 7 years old, and wears a retainer to correct her overbite until she gets her braces. Our children enjoy going to their appointments and are treated so kindly, and receive exceptional care. We are also grateful for Lindsey, Penny, Mary, David and the many other experienced staff that have helped our children. We received education from the qualified staff of why they had to wear retainers & rubber-bands, countless postcards reminding the kids to wear their retainers, and personalized care. Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall make you feel great about yourself and your smile. It is really rewarding to get your braces off, and have your picture with one of them, & receive a your reward from them with some balloons. We are so glad we chose Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall for their expertise in the field of orthodontics. We recommend them highly. We also really like the new office located at 1010 Calloway Drive Suite 200 A in Bakersfield, CA. We would like to thank the whole team for their help!

Thanks so much!!!

When I was 17 years old I had my wisdom teeth taken out and through the passing of time I saw and felt that my teeth were starting to move. I was not happy. I knew that they would only get worse because once one moved the rest would start getting out of place as well. I felt like my future looked tarnished. Any time I smiled I would feel self-conscious of my teeth. I was worried that they would get more out of place or even fall off.
I started looking around on the internet and I read about an Orthodontic treatment that was using new technology that wasn’t invasive called invisalign. So I looked for dr.’s in Bakersfield who used that treatment and found Dr.’s Montano and Cardall who were rated as the best in this field, the # 1 in the county and were up to date with the newest technology. So I made an appointment and from the first moment I stepped into their offices I was impressed. Their office is so modern and well kept. The people working there were so kind and polite. They explained everything form the 1st moment. My treatment lasted 2 years using Invisalign. They gave me all the options possible for payment and I felt very at home with them. I knew I could ask any question’s I had and they would answer them in a way I could understand. I felt very comfortable and like I could really trust them. I knew my treatment was in the best hands.
I can only encourage others to consider Montano & Cardall. They are the best.< /text>

I decided to pursue orthodontic treatment because like most people, I hated my smile. One day my dentist told me about a “cheaper” version of Invisalign called Clear Correct. So of course like anyone would I wanted to save money so I chose Clear Correct. My dentist told me it was exactly like Invisalign and I wouldn’t have any delays. To my understanding at the time my dentist was more than capable to do orthodontics because he told me he could. But he was completely wrong. I spent over a year doing orthodontic work with my dentist to little success. One day I found out that my dentist had sold his practice and moved out of town and he gave my case to Dr. Montano & Dr. Cardall. I went to my first consultation with Dr. Montano and quickly found out the dentists are NOT orthodontists. They take some classes in college in orthodontics but they are not a specialist. Dr. Montano & Dr. Cardall were very eager and happy to help me as I was upset that I was mislead by my dentist. The entire staff at Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall’s office are the friendliest and welcoming staff I have ever encountered. I would highly suggest them to any one. My advice for anyone is to never go through your dentist for orthodontic work. Go to an orthodontic specialist. They are certified in just orthodontics and will give you the best result, especially at Montano & Cardall’s office.</Review>

< Review>
I had a wonderful experience working with Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall's team.

When I relocated from Washington State 2 years ago, I was wearing bonded brackets and not sure if I wanted to switch to Invisalign.  Dr. Montano facilitated my decision making which resulted in decreased frequency dental decay and abscesses because wearing Invisalign facilitated my oral hygiene, aside being pain free from mouth sores due to the oral contact with wires/hooks and brackets.

I find every member of the team very supportive and professional throughout my 2 year treatment period.

From Dr. Montano's facial /verbal expression and demeanor, I can tell that Orthodontics is not just a profession but also his passion as well.  He took his time and gave an artistic touch during my treatment.

I'm glad Dr. Caldall joined the team recently so more people in the area can have more chance to shine with their smile.

Thank you all for the fabulous job you are doing for the community!

I would like to thank everyone at Montano's for their hospitality and professionalism.  Always greeted with a smile from the moment you open the entrance door to the time we head out.  I am very inquisitive so I tend to ask lots of questions (most of the time they are the same questions), and they are always answered with a kind smile over and over.  The best part is that my kids love to go and they feel very comfortable.  They trust the staff and greatly appreciate Dr. Montano's humbleness.  They walk out the office saying "I like Dr. Montano."  My kids are seeing the difference in their smile and they love it.  They did miss the previous play area, but they still enjoy their overall experience at Dr. Montano's.   I highly recommend Dr. Montano's office.   :)</Review>

I am so pleased we were directed to Montano's office. My son, Jacob had his braces put on at the age of 12 and enjoyed every single visit to Montano's office for the next 2 years there after. The staff are all so very friendly just as DR. MONTANO & DR. CARDALL! They talk to their patients to establish a great connection, take the time to get to know you....it brings such a family like atmosphere to their office. my son just had his braces taken off and he is so excited and proud of smile - its priceless. It's amazing how straight teeth changes the way you feel about your smile. Mom's next in line and I wouldn't go anywhere else but to Montano's Orthodontic.  I can't wait to experience the same excitement with my treatment.
A big thanks to Dr. Montano, Dr. Cardall, & all the staff! .....

<name>Triple G Roofing Huffman, TX</name><Date>1358524828288</Date><Rate>5</Rate><text>Montano Orthodontics created a family enviorment for my daughter when she started this process 5 years ago.  She had to have extensive work done on her teeth to get them the way they look today.  This is the most professional, friendliest, cleanist, and welcoming orthodontics firm that you will ever find!  They treated my whole family with respect and really worked with the financial part of it as well as the appointments to try and accomodate our work schedules.  My family has a background of denistry so when I moved here from the Bay Area, knowing that our kids would need braces one day I searched and interviewd over 10 orthodontics firms, and was most comfortable and pleased with Montano Orthodontics! We highly recommend Dr. Montano and staff and we will be sending our youngest there when it is her turn.  When it comes to having that perfect smile for adults or kids, you get what you pay for with Dr. Montano.  He and his staff are truly remarkable  and I would never go anywhere else. I may even get braces for me when my kids are done!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>
