So I’m torn on my rating. On one hand, we had a fantastic experience! My daughter takes her build-a-bear everywhere she goes! We got there when it opened so it wasn’t crowded. We had great customer service. It was an $80 bear, but she got everything she wanted. Now, my other daughter got house shoes and the grips are falling off only after a week.<//review>

< Review>
We went in the other day to get the bjrthday bear and two other bears for my daughter since they had such a great deal. Buy one get one for $10
Cheyenne was super friendly , she made the experience  so enjoyable for my 3 year old and she showed us we can put those smelly things inside to make the bear smell good. I think the guy who helped us was a manager of some sort but he was also really nice and helped picked out a cute sound for Olaf . I would for sure go back here. Great friendly employees!</Review>

Not 100% sure but it look like they are closed during COVID. I went in the 1st week of January around 5pm and they were closed. I also went in 1/22 at around 6pm and they were closed too.</text>

<review>My kids love this place. It is a kids dream to come here . They get to pick a stuff story they get to build. The staff here are helpful. There place is kept clean and we'll kept. Kids love it but as a parent I had to take 1 star off because 1st of all I am not that your anymore I can't wait standing up a long time. The are no seating are for adults we need it especially on the weekends when the line is long. Waiting 30 minutes or more just to build a bear is annoying. I almost left but good thing my wife had the patience. Since it is inside the mall it is not visible from the street. There are plenty of parking except on weekends stay away. If I had to come back I would definitely avoid the weekends.</review><Rating>4</Rating>< pictures>

Couldn’t be more thankful to the lovely young lady who went way out of her way to help me and my girls tonight, they were 10 minutes to closing (I drove far and didn’t realize they closed at 9) but she was so calm and reassuring even though the floor cleaners came in and started. Fulfilled my odd request and I have 2 very special bears and such a positive thought about build a bear now</Review>

Do NOT have a party at Build A Bear Work Shop! I originally had the smallest packaged but when I arrived today for the party, the Build A Bear employee told me if I upgraded there would be more of a variety of stuffed animals to choose from so I upgraded but to find out it's only a bunny and 3 bears that were very similar to each other.... A few different animals to choose from would different kinds of animals not 3 of the same bears with different shades of brown. My daughter was very let down so was all my guests. The employee made it seem way different than what it was. They sure did fool me to get more money... What a rip off... This was our first and last visit to Build A Bear Workshop!!!</Text>

<Text>My daughter when she was younger loved this store and it's a great experience for kids to interact with their friendly staff as you pick out your stuffed toys. Then they will stuff your child's toy to your child's pleasure then you pick out outfits and other items<//Text>< pics>

kept trying to upsell me by asking me 6 year old if she wanted to add things to her bear then tried to charge me when she said yes. I told them that transaction was between them and I wasn't paying for it. My 6 year old has no job or money. Pretty lame thing to do.</review>

This weekend was the 1st and LAST time I will ever take my 3 children to BAB!  I was one of the, I'm sure many, disappointed parents that wanted to take their children to your Pay your age event on July 12th.  I have 3 children under the age of 6 so when I heard of your event and it was going to be on my daughter's 4th Birthday I thought to myself we can't miss this!  After hearing about the mayhem and that you would be sending out coupons for $15 off I thought this just might work out for us since like I mentioned we have 3 kids so your bears are not the most larger family reasonable to purchase.  Which brings us to today......

I took my 3 very excited kids to get their 1st BAB!  When checking out I was told that the coupon is good for only 1 bear.  I asked the girl at the counter if the promotion was for only 1 kid or was it for every kid per family.  She said that yes it was for every kid in the family.  So then I asked why then is the coupon for only 1 child and she did not know.  I asked to speak to her manager and she just laughed and very rude and condescending said call the number on your receipt.  Wow!  That's all!  I was very surprised by her lack of remorse or even just good old fashion customer service skills.  I made sure to get her name Sofia in the Ontario Mills BAB and she just glared at me as if to shoot daggers at me.  Again what happened to the old fashioned customer service... my small children were in there with me so I left it alone and just left the store.

I ended up having what started out as a very exciting family adventure to leaving with fumes coming out and sitting in the car ride the entire time typing this email!

Signed a VERY DISSATISFIED DISAPPOINTED FURIOUS CUSTOMER NO MORE!</review>

<text>It's ok, not as much selection as the others.🤔 Maybe got there on an off day. Staff was awesome. 😁Really helpful. Disappointed that the web site is a bit misleading.  We thought they still had stock of the Jurassic world because the site showed a dino was available.🦕 However, it was just the online store not the mills. Buyer's beware. 😤🤑🤪< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

< review>
This was so fun! We were just strolling by, on the way to Dave and Busters. Decided to pop in, and check it out. I had heard they have Star Trek bears. We looked around, and nothing.

On our way out, my hubby asked if they have ever seen a Star Trek one here. She says yes! And takes him to a bin. Where one lone Spok bear was hiding. Then, took us to a shelf, and in the far back, there were outfits for them. Yes!

So, we got him. It was super busy there. We were 7th in line to fill our bear. But it moves super quick. You then pick a sound, (optional at an additional charge) and  then get your bear stuffed.  You hold the petal down with your foot, while the person working does the stuffing.

They have a ritual, which, being adults, she may have sensed our hesitancy, and made it simple. You put a heart on your nose, make a wish, kiss the heart, and it goes inside the bear. Super cute. It may be more elaborate for kids.

They have a station with a brush, to clean him up, and dress. We just took ours home. Then, a station to make, and print a birth certificate. Very adorable, but we opted out of that. We got the bear, with sound, 1 outfit, and a phaser. Came out to about 52 dollars. More than we expected. But worth it.

It was a fun experience. Staff was super friendly, and helpful. Make sure to ask, if you don't see something you are looking for! They have SO many options!< /review>

<review>Dr. Lily is phenomenal. She is very knowledgeable and answers any questions that you have. I have been to several chiropractors, and the biggest thing that stuck out to me about Dr. Lily was how she talked me through everything she was doing. Also, when my muscles are too tense to adjust, she rubs out the muscles and then adjusts.

The office staff is very helpful, and if you need a massage, they have a massage therapist too. Honestly, it one of the best massages I have ever had. Cody, the massage therapist stated that he loves his job because he puts people back together. I believe that statement reflexes how Dr. Lily feels about her job as well.<//review>< pictures>

I have never visited a chiropractor before out of fear that it will make my neck and back pain worse let alone the The horrifying sound of popping. Dealing with chronic pain is life changing and depressing. Everyday I deal with pain and extremely painful numb arms, hands and fingers. Today I had my first appointment and I'm so thankful I took the plunge and faced my fears. I received an adjustment and massage. As soon as both were done I felt different not different that all my pain magically disappeared but my pain changed, my numbness is still here but it isn't the burning stabbing numbness it's more of a numbness like a foot going to sleep (so much better) but what has changed most just after 1 appointment is my mindset. The pain CAN be treated and I have hope and determination now where as this morning and any other day lately I didn't care if I lived or died. Having the massage after was really something great and he worked out a couple issues that I didn't even know existed. Over all I'm thankful and will be spending time with living roots. I would recommend this place for anyone needing healing.<//Text>

Unprofessional office staff, that was the extent of my visit as was not able to get requested massage service nor was I informed prior to my arrival that Gabi was no longer at their office location.  Instead made up some story that I had a Groupon (which I never said in our communications) and that she could not see me.  So ended up driving across town in the heat of the afternoon for utter waste of time with no services rendered.</Text>

They don't answer the phone so I had to go in person to speak with someone. Appointments are booked for weeks upon a time, having to make multiple trips one for a massage and another for an adjustment, and now the service provider will be out for an extended period of time. I'm over it. Going elsewhere<//text>

She gave me time to trust her even though I was adjusted my first visit. I've been going ever since. My headaches have gotten better. My lock jaw doesnt flare up constantly like it used to and even the movement in my neck is getting better. Thank you Fatima! Oh btw. If you think it's too expensive, they take most insurances. And no insurance? Or none that will cover Chiropractic care? No worries there. Fatima or Jillian will work with you. It's like a Family environment. Check them out. Look them up on Groupon they have deals there for first timers.</Review>< pictures>

Wow, wow, wow! Ihave let my known back issues go for years. Dr Lily and her team were incredibly professional, affordable and after just my 1st visit, I am confident that she truly knows what she is doing! She explained everything very clearly and made my visit very pleasant and informative. Honestly, from my 1st phone call I could tell that this team was ready to help me. I got the assessment, adjustment and the Swedish massage treatment package. I just don't know why I have waited so long to start healing myself. If you have back pain, I would highly suggest giving Dr Lily a call! Just one visit and I feel better. I am definitely going back because 20 years of pain isn't fixed in 2 hours. I am so glad I did this. Thabk you so much Dr. Lily! You and your staff were awesome!< /Text>

<Text>I can not rate this company as I've never been there.

However, I was shocked at the response to a client who did not show up. All I can say is wow. American River College has an amazing Effective Effective Writing Communication. Please consider re-writing your correspondence.</Text>< user_id>

Dr Lily and Dr Fetema are the best chiropractors I've seen. They are thorough, friendly,  and quite effective, with great rates to boot. I highly recommend this office for your chiropractic needs.< /review>

< Review>
A friend had been going here was a while, and I had heard nothing but good things from her about her experience. She ended up finding me a Groupon deal there for a chiropractic adjustment and 3 massages for under $100 (great deal by the way). And with nagging muscle and alignment issues, how could I say no? The office is small and quaint up front, but opens up in the back to several chiropractic and massage areas. Dr. Lily was very professional and social, which was a plus, and she did an excellent job. The deep tissue massage was great as well, and was needed just as much as the alignment. I look for forward to the 2 more as part of my package deal. A helpful piece of advice prior to your massage is to make sure you're properly hydrated before and after.

I was and it made muscle fatigue and soreness nonexistent for me. I'll definitely be going back in the future for my chiropractic issues and massage needs, and highly recommend their services< /Review>

She gave me a brief introduction of musculoskeletal system, especially the spine and how such a disorder affects general health via nervous system. She did some adjustments (my hips, back, shoulder...) and she did it perfect! My main reason to this place is to adjust my shoulder and she did great job. I highly recommend this place.

As a pregnant woman, the state of CA has me on disability leave. I was so upset about the rudeness and discrimination (I'm sure she meant for people that didn't look like me) that I had to leave my massage early and cancel my chiro.

Not recommended for people on a fixed income or anyone less fortunate. Definitely don't go here if you have trauma or PTSD.< /text>

<Review>Park Fifth is pretty chill. There are nice amenities such as a rooftop with a pool and a good view as well as convenient amenities such as a doggie wash room. I like how spacious the balconies are and how modern and artistic the over all architectural design is. Neil was my leasing agent and he was very nice and personable. The people at the front desk such as Ezri , Riley, and Luke are very nice and helpful and it is a very safe community.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1621990083634, 'text': 'Thank you, Alexandria, for leaving this wonderful review!

<Review>I love Park Fifth Tower and the helpful and courteous staff that make this new high rise apartment building the best in DTLA. The amenities are amazing, salt water infinity pool and spa, and BBQ pits on the 25th and the 3rd floor. I like having a BBQ pit on the 3rd floor because I can bring Simple Single Sock the fun loving PWD of Park Fifth Tower! Even more pet friendly is the bath and grooming area, plus there is a super safe and secure pet relief place!! Just giving a shout out to the friendly staff that helped with a tour of the building, Meghan, signing the paperwork, Luke, the concierge folks that I've met so far, Neil, Riley, Tom, Zay and Ray, as well as Willie, that keeps all the maintenance in check, and Lupe, who made the apartment spotless before move in!! The atmosphere is very inviting and it feels like I have a new family of neighbors! Simple wanted to share her photos by the fire pit and ringing in the New Year with a spectacular view! Follow Simple on IG@PWD_Player for more adventures of Simple Single Sock at Park Fifth Tower!! Thanks Park Fifth Tower for a great move in and high rise living experience!!</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBs5UPSYi-RZdi0ggyPdSLKVSOm1zsQ7Kq8LB_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhUOxDg4njqrGtkxN_5cgXiGFfHQ-iB0Rq5T46=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8HBWKbEtZRPoClcc-Ur5Oha2_QatG-Cs1d2LW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>{'time': 1578334506490, 'text': 'This review made our day!

I love how she greeted all the tenants and knew everyone who lived in it!! It was nice hearing how she cared for the mundane things in their life even taking her time to greet not just the people but also their pets!! Her attention to detail was commendable and definitely sets apart this concierge service living space from others! The place is beautiful with amazing amenities! One could sense the pride and the care that the staff puts in this place! The place was impeccable considering that they allow pets!

Stopped in after hours and found a very pleasant young Man at front desk; Ezri was very knowledgeable of the building and what it offered. He gave me a tour when I requested  it of all the common areas. Wow they did not disappoint. From the roof top pool and gym to all areas for socializing; this building is A++ for thinking of and designing ways to make it an amazing place to live. Looking forward to going back and seeing  the apartments< /Text>

I came here with a few friends and I was very impressed by Riley’s hospitality! She was the first one to greet us and was very kind and accommodating. It’s clear that she knows the tenants on a personal level, making the property feel like a closer community. It’s a beautiful place, I highly recommend checking it out!</text>

Park Fifth is such a gem in downtown. The building is new and the amenities are modern, high-end, beautiful, and always well kept. The staff is so professional and personable, they really make the place feel welcoming and are always able to help out. Reilly, at the front desk, Willie, the maintenance manager, and Matt, the community manager, offer a great and positive experience for everyone who comes through Park Fifth. Good vibes here!<//review>

<Text>Park Fifth is an incredible community. I’ve lived here for close to a year now, and this is the first time in 8 years that I am renewing my lease. The management and leasing team is very thoughtful and attentive. Luke helped me find the perfect apartment and knew every detail about the property, down to the amount of sun exposure the pool receives at that time of year. The entire Park Fifth staff is friendly and always on it. Reilly is THE BEST!!! The amenities are top notch and the appliances are high end in comparison to other apartment communities in the area. I love calling this community my home!<//Text>< rating>

Park Fifth is an incredible place to call home. I can't say enough for how much Meghan helped to make the leasing process as seamless as possible. A big thank you to Willy, Gio, and the maintenance team for all their hard work in meeting my move-in date. Since I was on Corporate Housing and decided to lease the same apartment, Willy did a thorough walk-thru of my apartment and listened to all my needs. In less than 2 days, he was able to re-paint the entire place, fix all the items we discussed, and do a complete deep clean. Amazing turnaround! This is truly an great place to live and the staff really goes above and beyond!< /text>

I am so glad that I came across Park Fifth in my apartment search. I had a fantastic experience here from start to finish. Evri at the concierge desk was so kind and accommodating from the moment that I walked into the building. Even though I was quite early for my tour, he invited me to sit down and went to see if anyone was available to give me a tour earlier than scheduled. I was lucky enough to be shown around the building by Karis. Karis was welcoming, engaging, and answered every question that I had about the building and the different units. She listened to what I was looking for in an apartment and structured our tour accordingly. Karis went above and beyond to help me find the perfect place. On top of the wonderful staff at Park Fifth, the building itself is new, modern, and full of fine details (e.g., soft-close drawers and cabinets, black-out curtains in certain apartments, etc.). And the view from the gym on the top floor of the building is absolutely incredible. This is an amazing building, and I am so excited to move here in the fall.<//Review>

Meghan is the best leasing manager of all the spots I've toured downtown. She is super professional, answered all the questions I had, made the lease and move in process super easy. They're entire staff also deserves alot of credit for their best in class customer service. They're always on top of everything and always go out of their way to make you feel important.

<Review>So I ultimately ended up moving to a different place, but I have to say two things the about this complex it is beautiful and the staff is amazing.

Karis, provided one of if not the best leasing/tour experience I’ve ever had. I recommend anyone looking to tour this property  request Karis; impeccable customer service.

Great communication in follow up, Karis went above and beyond to take my needs into account when selecting spaces to show me, and even found the details for a couch I loved in one of the community spaces.

Park Fifth Tower Apartments, sets the bar very high in DTLA. Associations in the area should take notes!< /Review>< Pics>

I love the building it’s amazing living there. I enjoy having the park close by and having Pershing square across it’s very convenient. I love how the staff is always ready to help the great customer service and assistance when there is an issue with my apartment. I love how they are attentive specially Jay trying to help whenever a problem arises. He is a very smart and talented young man.< /text>

Alarms were getting tested at the building today and it was kind of hard to be at my apartment with my 2 year old son, but it I know is a step required to make the building safer. Jay and Gio came to my apartment and they assisted with a few items that need it to be taken care of. They were very fast and professional.

Thank you guys<//text>

<Text>Recently toured Park Fifth and I love it here!! the whole team has been great so far. After living in various apartment buildings across DTLA is clear that Park Fifth is in a different level. Not only the building itself is brand new, the building is well maintained.

If I could give the award for the best building I would give it to park and fifth. I’ve lived in other properties and nothing like this building. This high-rise is amazing with views and the amenities are incredible to have. I would like to say the the entire staff is great but no one like the building engineers this property has very attentive and very helpful once we have issues at the property. Jay one of the guys is amazing at his job very smart and knows how to fix the issues. I am glad he helps and is attentive to our needs thank you Jay for the hard work and professionalism you have towards your job and the residents of the property we appreciate you!< /Review>

<Review>During this difficult time, it’s incredible how our building has so much care for their tenants, taking care of all the issues and making sure we are in a safe building. They have opened the gym so I don’t have to go to the gym an expose myself instead I can workout at the building and be safe. When I need help opening the nano windows Jay is always there to help. He never makes me wait and is always extraordinarily helpful.</Review>< Pictures>

I stopped by Park Fifth to obtain more information about potentially leasing a unit and I was greeted by this young man named Jay. He asked me to be seated and started asking if I need it anything to drink. Jay went above and beyond to make me feel welcomed. Their lobby was trendy and inviting. Let me just say that the amenities are just amazing. Their gym has an amazing 360 panoramic view to the city. This building is one of the best in DTLA and they just open a month and a half ago. This place is very luxurious.< /Review>

What an amazing building. Not only the amenities are beautiful, the units are also amazing. The finishes inside the units are way better than most of the new luxury buildings in DTLA.

On January 2, 2020 my wife and I were privileged to have received a 5 star tour of the Park Fifth Tower facilities. Meghan Hays was most engaging and thorough, demonstrating a good working knowledge of both facilities and leasing particulars. She’s a winner and is a superb front door to the Park Fifth community.< /text>

A special thank you to Meghan for the outstanding tour of Park Fifth Tower when we were in LA recently. I was blown away by the state-of-the-art exercise facilities and the magnificent skyline. If we make the choice to live downtown LA, Park Fifth Tower would be a great choice for us!</Review>

As we were reading the Los Angeles Business Journal there was a building that caught our attention “Park Fifth Tower”. We parked at their parking structure and we were delightful as how clean and safe it looks. As we were walking around the parking structure two of their building engineers (jay and gio) told us if we need it help or if we were looking for an apartment, from that first impression I would say we have the right building for us to lease; since we come from a building that has no customer service whatsoever.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

My journey began when my lease was up back in October 2019  and I knew I was not going to renew it . I had seen PARK FIFTH because I would visit that part of DT regularly so I was watching the building go up . I decided to reach out regarding the opening of the property and became very interested once I saw the website . I initially spoke to Luke and then I reached Meghan on one of the calls I made regarding the opening . Meghan was FANTASTIC I explained to her that I was moving and I wanted to see the building however I was going to be leaving for 2 months for the holiday season. I explain to her what I was looking for and we began the process. In November Meghan sent me some pics of a unit that she felt would suit my husband and I we went through a few units until we reached the perfect one. Meghan was great she sent videos and well as pictures we choose a unit put a deposit down based on Meghan’s GREAT response to what we needed. Meghan has made an experience that could have been challenging considering I was out of town and could not psychically see the unit into a pleasant experience . Meghan and the whole team Luke , Matthew , and  Neil have been excellence there representation of PARK FIFTH is par excellent from the day I got off the plane from my holiday vacation came to the property to see it , moved in and now taking in and enjoying my new home . Thanks Meghan your simply THE BEST . 🙌🏽<//Review>

Park Fifth's leasing team works wonders with their attentiveness and attention to the prospective tenant - which is why I decided to live here! Let me start off and say that I'm a hard sell and have a particular judgement palette

I've lived at other DTLA luxury buildings and will say that Meghan, the leasing office, and front desk personnel (Steve, Tom, and Riley) make Park Fifth a fun, clean, and relaxing building to live in DTLA. Definitely one of the elite and new luxury buildings in a prime location in DTLA. Meghan addressed my concerns, answered all my questions about the building and the unit I was interested in, all while moving me in the expedited and critical timeline I was requesting. I can't help but say that Meghan paid so much attention to what I needed and wanted, all while being receptive, respectful, delightful, and accommodating.

The building amenities and my 1 bed x 1 bath unit are immaculately clean and thought through, reinforcing all safety precautions for COVID-19 and social distancing requirements from the CDC. All employees and residents wear masks (thankfully) and the building has enough shared space for residents to comfortably social distance in an amenity section. Did I mention how beautiful the indoor building decor is? As well as little details in my apartment?! I am so pleased with the clean design that's still homey, modern, spacious, and welcoming.

I have to say that this location is prime and a little bit on the quieter side, which is nicer for someone who loves the city life but needs home life to be less chaotic due to the unpredictable times and busy work from home schedule. This has been an easy place for my dog and I to adjust as well in the last week and a half; which makes me feel more secure about my decision to live at Park Fifth.

I really could go on and on about the people and the building but this is an already long review with nothing to negatively comment. I'm happy with my decision to live at Park Fifth and am excited to call this home.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I have lived in downtown for 5 years and wanted to stay with Greystar. I was waiting for the next best building to open, and I think I found it!

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>We just moved into this building and it's fantastic. The design of everything is really well curated and tasteful and the staff is amazing. The rooftop is spectacular, and the apartments themselves have the best finishings and noise insulation we have seen. We looked at Aven, Atelier, Griffin/Grace, 888 Hope, 825 Hope, and others and this is the best building, which is why we selected it. Meghan has been wonderful through the leasing process and getting us settled in.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1578334299539, 'text': 'Thank you for the wonderful feedback!

<Review>My fiancé and I went to check a few apartment buildings in downtown LA since we live in OC. We decided to stop by Park Fifth since it’s a new building, also is pretty convenient for us since its in the middle of downtown and has everything we need. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to tour the building because we were limited on time and didn’t have time to walk the building. Two gentlemen at the lobby (Jay and Gio) referred us to the building’s website to make an appointment. We would like to come back and hopefully lease one of their apartments.<//Review>< pics>

DTLA living #1 rule is to make sure the staff is attentive and responsive. Rule #1, check! Mayra was a total delight and thorough in answering all my questions. Also, the building and amenities are going to be top notch. (I can already tell this place is going to be amazing not just aesthically...the vibe is right)< /review>

< review>
I lived there for one year and unfortunately i ll have to live cause i was not able to move fully to the USA and the lease is the lease is too expensive for a secondary home during covid time.
Anyway the building is the best in L.A so far. I didnt find any spot to compete with it. I had some troubles sometime with the staff and i was unhappy to fully pay the rent for accomoditations i was not able to use during the lock down. I felt it was not fair. But anyway i'll only keep great memories!< /review>

Working with Taylor on building a 1500hp capacity Coyote longblock for my Hellion twin turbo car.  Put $4,000 deposit on the engine 6/14  and looking forward to closing the deal. So far so good. Will update as we proceed.< /Text>

Excellent quality. Tight tolerances. Great for serious builders. Purchased their forged rods for my "White Angel" 1000HP F-150 build.
If I could give more stars I would.
Thank you MMR for providing exceptional quality parts and customer service. Definitely be coming to you guys again for future purchases and upgrades!<//review>

While I was initially unhappy, the company reached out and explained that my initial e-mail explaining the trouble had not been received, and they have taken quick action in order to get the issue I had with my power steering pump resolved. I appreciate that once communication was established that every effort was made to get this handled ASAP. Thanks guys!</review>

Best customer service and quality with modular engines. True innovators, they never stop improving. Highly recommend if your having a performance modular engine built or need any performance parts for your modular powered race car. Mark and his team have made a repeat customer out of me and it's always a pleasure to work with them.<//text>

This vendor is the real deal, will deliver what they promise you, and is a joy to work with.
We ordered the custom-built motor from MMR via Greg, who went out of the way to answer all our technical questions from the beginning.  We told him our requirements (up to 30 psi boost from a 4L Whipple with a later option to add NOS). Greg suggested ported and polished heads and a stage 2 Comp cams. He clearly explained technically his reasoning for the addition of the extras and the gains we will get from the same, he is clearly a race expert. We agreed to the build, the final price and actually added some more extras at our own choice, including a high-volume oil pump with billet gears, billet crank position wheel and red fire- coated pistons.  The timeframe for the build was clearly defined at the outset.
During the build, we had questions and called him often. Greg always came to the phone and went out of his way to answer our technical questions. We wish we could say that for all other vendors in the US, but unfortunately some other vendors are hard to get a hold of and will not answer emails. Not MMR - we always had phone and email responses from them and Greg should take the credit for that.  Greg was patient with us as we requested ETA updates towards the end of our build period.
The motor arrived on a pallet, well-mounted and protected from any possible damage. Since it was International shipping to Canada, we also requested that we ship with another company instead of their regular shipper. Greg had no problem with that and accommodated us without issues. The motor is a work of art and the quality that Greg put into it is hard to duplicate.
As we started to bolt on the components, we noticed that the block had missing dowel pins. Not MMR’s fault, the block came from Ford Racing and I guess they just don’t add the dowel pins to the block. We called Greg at MMR and he shipped us a dowel kit and didn’t even charge us for them.
We would highly recommend using MMR for any custom-built motors/products!  The quality and customer service are hard to beat.  And we did contact several other builders before choosing MMR and can confirm MMR’s pricing to be competitive in the marketplace.< /Text><Date>1604956009852< /Date><resp>None<//resp>< name>

One of the most unprofessional companies I have seen. Yes you have world records but you also went after a youtuber over a negligent  amount of reviews and essentially paid him to review your product in a good light. Totally unprofessional and a shame to see such a high quality company resort to such childish actions in response to criticism. This criticism is what also lead to you to getting in keyboard battles with reviewers over leaving a negative review.< /Review>

I had originally ordered mmr forged rods and forged pistons through a company called cushman motorsports. I had received all the parts and was in a hurry so sent everything out for balancing right away. When i got them back, i realized cushman motorsports sent me rods for a different engine. I responded and jim from cms told me he wanted nothing to do with me and blamed it on on me. After rounds with cms, getting nowhere and more frustrated, i called mmr and explained the situation. Taylor from mmr told me to ship the rods back and they would see what they could do. Once mmr recieved the rods, Taylor said they where gonna not only return them and get me the one's that i needed, but they were going to cover the difference in pricing due to the right rods being $70 more. I cant speak highly enough about mmr. That is customer service at its best and is why i will continue to use mmr!</text>

I would like to address those that have left Google reviews for MMR after watching my “itsjusta6” youtube video. As the actual customer & out of respect to MMR I would like to clarify that the statement I made about piston rings possibly being missing from the engine was simply a guess and turned out to be incorrect. The problems with the engine had absolutely nothing to do with MMR. Thanks to MMR for helping me get the engine fixed up and ready for racing again!<//text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Amazing products, I love that this company is always developing new parts to help us racers go faster and faster. So far Iv ran 2 mmr built coyote engines in my car and I currently have 1 engine being built for my street car. My current race car engine is a fully built mmr genx long block, we’ve made over 2400hp at the crank with it and just recently broken the coyote world record for ET In the 1/4(in a steel body car). I’m blown away by how well this engine has performed, 4 6 second passes. 4 7.0 passes and 10-15 other passes all under 7.5 seconds in the 1/4. Not to mention this engine has withstood making over 1800whp on the dyno! I can’t wait to see what other products mmr develops and I’m excited to push the coyote world record even quicker and faster. Great Job mmr, keep it up! Us racers need you. It’s a shame there is so many fake reviews about mmr. Just goes to show you how much other companies are worried.</Text>< Pics>

< review>
Well it started off a little rocky. If anyone read my review before this, I was a little heated and short tempered.
I’m editing this review now because In the end, things got ironed out.
I know these guys are trying to run a company along with run a race team. Juggling business on two fronts.
I didn’t get the cams I wanted but the ones I got seem to be fine. I’m not sure if the step up would have made a huge difference other than the sound at idle.
There was some mix up with cam cap bolts, I ended up fixing that myself even though I had to pay another store, so basically charged twice for the same thing.
A few more small parts were over looked but everything worked out in the end.
As for the build of the block, we are in the process of tuning right now and everything seems to be holding up.
Their oil cooler system for the GT500 is pretty damn awesome. My engine temps are down by almost 20 degrees. We have great oil pressure with their hurricane pump. The engine is balanced damn near perfectly. The car never ran this smooth when it was new.
The power output on the same boost as when it was stock is pretty amazing.

I am very satisfied with the build of the short block itself.
I wish I would have gotten the correct cams and other parts. I did have to jump through some hoops to get this thing back together.

There may have been some misconception about the cams on their website. Maybe a better description of what they consider the cams to be. On all other websites, the stage 2 comp cam is what MMR considers a stage 3. So when I thought I was getting a stage 3, it was actually a stage 2.

Now that this thing is up and running, time will tell on how much abuse this thing can take. We are at 15psi now. We will be cranking it up in a few weeks on race gas and see what this little mod motor can do.<//review>

<UserId.>117846060614046484111</UserId.><review>I have finally gotten around to writing a review.
I spent 20, almost 25kK on a fully built engine, with Mark Lutton, Turbochargerd 76mm package..  My 5.2 bored and stroked built by MMR  blew up three times on the Dyno, under Mark's supervision. I was charged with R&R charges for all blown engines to the tune of 6K  .well, I  have nothing anything but after 3 years it has to be brought up..  His mechanic at the time (Which was himself) described him as a "snake in the grass." Over the course of 6 monhts.  Chris went on the become to an Oxnard PD.   Three engines blew up before I got to drive my car, and 20k.

Unless you are dealing with "mark" do NOT! Repeat do NOT! Try and speak with these untrained staff. Not only do they always say system is "down" I could never get a hold of the owner. Defective parts where sent completely ruined my build. No solution since my builder already had everything ready to installed and noticed the F&%K up. Both guys I spoke with said "No returns on part installed". This is how these folks play.

I would give them 0 stars if I could.
I ordered their track pack kit.
and I asked them if this was a part that was in stock, and when i could expect it so I could schedule an appointment for my customer.
they told me it was in stock, and I should expect it in 3 to 4 days.
the next day they called me and told me it was out of stock, and I would have to wait a week.
I let my customer know.
A week went by and they called back, and told me it would be another week.
3 weeks went by.. no parts, my customer got pissed at me, and I had to refund his money.
I called modular motorsports, and told them what happened, and refused delivery of the parts when they finally came in.
modular motorsport told me that they were going to charge me a restocking fee!!! after they cost me money, and a customer.
when I told them I was not going to pay a restocking fee, the guy got extremely rude with me, I asked to talk to the manager, they manager said that they were going to blacklist me, and never to call back, and he hung up on me.
Greg the owner just called me as I was typing this.
He agreed to wave the restocking fee, but still charging me shipping...$22.00<//review>

Modular Motorsports Racing is the best! Spent over 5k on just the engine and worth every penny. It's been about two years with the built engine and runs amazing. I will always buy products from MMR. Taylor was really helpful when I meet him. MMR is always there to explain everything. Thanks again MMR.<//review>

<Review>Ordered Cams online and made sure i asked for some STOCK Cams over the phone after my order was placed for my 4.6 DOHC 1997 Ford Mustang Cobra and they sent me bigger than stock racing Cams that are not stock so they didn't fit unless engine was modified which it wasn't nor was it going to be. Just wanted a stock build and they just screwed me over with bigger Cams than I wanted. When I asked for my money back they accused me of using them before even looking at the parts which were still brand new and refused to refund my money... save your the hassle and DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE GUYS... IF THEY CAN FIND A WAY TO SCREW YOU OVER THEY WILL! Buy parts from another website/ company. I wish I could give them 0 stars because they don't even deserve one.

It is a shame that the people who don't know how their car works, don't know what they need, omit or provide incorrect information(again because they don't have a clue), seem to have the most time to go on the internet and write bad reviews about businesses. MMR has, I'm sure, provided service to thousands of customers. Looking at this review page you would think twice about calling. Call them first. These guys answer the phone every time I have ever called, have more experience than anyone with these modular motors, and their pricing is the best I've seen anywhere. Of course they will be busy. Any good business is. The company I give the 0 Star rating to is Google, for allowing these misleading reviews to be posted at all. Of course mistakes will happen when you are dealing with people(employees etc.), mistakes on the customers part and the suppliers part.  Allowing even a couple of these bad reviews to be posted when they have had thousands of good transactions is very misleading. Building engines takes time. Having built many engines over many years you appreciate the time and effort that goes into it.  In conclusion, if you need anything for your modular motor do not hesitate to call these guys. They will take care of you. Google sucks and if you cant handle learning about your car, go buy a prius and play Gran Turismo on your play station.</Text>

Unfortunately, they sent me a set of completely mismatched pistons and my kit was missing parts.  They were from three or four different batches, and there was a ten gram difference between the lightest and heaviest of each.  Manley piston sets are very rarely comprised of pistons from multiple batches, and are "set matched" to ensure they are within three grams of each other.   I contacted MMR over the phone, and whoever answered did not find that to be an issue in our initial conversation, and told me to have my machinist cut some material off.  I told him I wanted a matched set, just like Manley would have sent them, so the fellow at MMR said he'd "look into it."  A few days go by without response so I call again, and email.  At this point, they told me to send in the pistons "to inspect, and if there are any issues, they will replace them for me."  The issue was clear.  Before sending them, I asked them to email a paid shipping label since this was an issue on THEIR end.  I was told their system wasn't set up that way, but they would reimburse me in full for the cost of shipping the pistons if they were "found to be bad."  Well they were bad. At this point a few weeks had gone by, two or three, then another one or two weeks to get a set of matched pistons.  Then, they refused to reimburse me for the shipping cost, and Greg said he, "would never say something like that," referencing reimbursing me for the shipping costs.  His actual words.  In the end I did get a reimbursement, but it was almost six months later, after disputing it with the credit card company, and getting them on our side.

Moral of the story, I'd never go back, and never recommend them.  They don't quality control before shipment.  Take their BBB rating with a grain of salt.  They are not a BBB accredited company and literally have ONE review on there, giving MMR the A rating they reference in the other complaints.

TLDR:  ordered stroker kit, received mismatched pistons, didn't really believe me, took over a month to get a matched set, wouldn't reimburse the shipping for their own screw up after telling me they would, got credit card company involved, and six months later they "made good" on their own word.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<rating>2</rating><review>Very surprised... I go out of my way to hit a Portola Coffee because their coffee is (typically) so dang good. I've got nothing but great things to say about the other locations. But this was the worst cappuccino, relative to expectations, I've had in a long time.< /review>< Pics>

Went here with a couple of friends on Saturday around 1pm. Cute place, with some tables and people doing work. They do have a couple tables that say no laptops allowed, and we were able to snag a spot.< /review>

Great coffee place but if your in a hurry maybe skip on down to a chain place. When you look around it looks more like a chem lab than a coffee bar but it is an all coffee lab.  Worth the wait for a great cup of joe. They have a few pastries to choose from but not a huge selection.<//Review>

Great coffee and some bakery items. Lines can get a bit long but the coffee is worth the wait. Tried a cookie dough stuffed donut that was awesome.< /review>

<review>Great little spot. Coffee was very good, I had one of their special varieties served black.
Staff is very friendly. There were only 2 ladies working here, and a line at least 30 people long. They were really hustling but still managed to be friendly and even took the time to make sure I got a certain discount that I was going to miss out on.
Highly recommmend.< /review>< Pics>

<text>This is for 9/3/2018 experience with an espresso and gaspar. I have been to every Portola Location 10+ times. Worst coffee I have ever tasted was here. Espresso was so bad , i had to ask them to remake it. Gaspar, a drink which should not be very hot was served so bad, it tasted really bad as well. Crew here just don’t care. This is not the typical Portola experience. Hope this is fixed. It is located in a busy shopping mall< /text>< GmapID>

Though the customer service experience was more of a 3, the coffee was so great I’m still leaving 5 stars. They mixed up several orders, including mine, and things got a bit chaotic for a bit. The baristas were visibly flustered, but things happen. As far as the coffee, the roast is just right, they know how to pull proper espresso shots (even decaf), the cream is fresh and local, and they keep the sweetness at just the right amount to let the espresso shine through. If you’re looking for a great quality coffee or espresso, I would highly recommend.< /text>

<Review>Quiet for a Friday morning.  Coffee is subjective and I'm sure there are folks liking lighter brews.  I tried two of their cold brews on tap.  Both were more like  a dark tea/light coffee and there was some fruity tones to those samples.

I am more of a fan of a bolder full bodied cup.  The iced Americano was also on the lighter side.  Though it is a nice, clean, trendy place.

The baked goods looked fantastic, but I definitely don't need the extra calories.

If you are looking for the place, it's in the indoor food court area.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Great coffee. The flavor of the vanilla breve is awesome, but at $6 it is an insane amount for a cup of coffee. The small indoor area is similar to the meat packing district, very trendy. Great people watching area.</text>

Meh. Long wait when not busy for kinda mediocre coffee. It some how lands in the area of full flavor strong coffee that's not bitter but still manages to make you wish you were drinking something else.  Looks like they are using some kinda electronic aero press.  Should have saved my $3 bucks and put it toward a beer.< /Review>

Suuuuuuuper slow hipster pour-over, chemistry-set coffee - OMG - two parties in line ahead of me and it took 10 minutes in line just to get a pastry. I gave up on a coffee because I could see it would take another 10 mins. Can’t just get a regular cup of drip here.<//review>

Visited family for the weekend and my uncle took us here during the local farmer's market. Lot of amazing food and nice people! There was also vendors selling a range of goods and it was interesting to see various types of art that I'm not used to. Would definitely check it out if you love fresh produce and supporting local vendors! I believe the farmers market is only on the weekends but I'd double check before heading there.</text>

<review>There are usually musicians here during the Saturday Lakeshore Farmers market. there's food stalls around and you can sit here and eat, there are usually a small number of tables and chairs. At night it's just empty and nothing much to speak of, just a small plaza opposite the Grand lake theater.</review>< Time>

A gem of an urban park, mostly maintained by neighborhood volunteers. The Saturday farmer's market is year-round, and well worth a visit. Restaurants in the Grand Lake neighborhood (on Grand and Lakeshore) are diverse and welcoming. The Grand Lake Theatre shows first run movies and include an organ player on Friday and Saturday evenings. A walk around Lake Merritt is a 3 mile jaunt well worth the effort.</text>

Definitely worth visiting on a Saturday morning. Every Saturday there is a farmers market with lots of good produce and food to buy from vendors. My favorite is the waffle truck. It gets pretty busy around there, but you can ussually easily find parking close by.< /Text>

Nice little Farmers Market. Parking close is an issue but you're going to be walking anyway so what's another few blocks. Great produce, much from Watsonville I believe.<//Text>

The technician insisted he didn’t do anything wrong and that the overspray was done from previous work (which was FVB as well). The manager graciously tried to do some damage control and had the tech buff the paint. Last year we got it all fixed somewhere else as the paint just got worse.
The photos are from my other daughter’s car which she had done about 5 years ago. They were supposed to put a new bumper. Maybe they did but they obviously did NOT use factory paint.
So sad to see such a great body shop go so bad!< /Review><gmapID>0x80dd275ecfb30ddb:0xb4c12919f52d787f< /gmapID><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-7q6lMqOczFALjWk_T-PfVCXE0_kxcO_QOBQc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLusVCKm1IOjlj0dJQzzf3TAkq_N6guRhxkhCr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics></record>

Had a minor bumper repair/replacement after being rear-ended in a drive-thru.  Had everything done in 2 days, and the work is outstanding! Jeff at the location on Euclid, was friendly, efficient and professional.  State Farm (the other party’s carrier) and Hertz Car Rental were equally efficient and professional.  Easiest repair I’ve ever dealt with.  I had a $5000 job done at the Newhope location several years ago. The ship’s service and repairs were equally outstanding. My go-to shop, and the one I recommend to there needing bodywork.</Text>

I've lived in fv my whole life and have brought all my cars here for every body issue I've ever had. I've been in major wrecks and had minor dings, and everything in between. The staff are always very friendly and very helpful, with great communication along the way. Usually they offer multiple options from the most cost effective to the best solution, depending on my needs. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the local area who needs body work done!! They work great with insurance claims or not, whatever you need!< /Review>< Pictures>

The second time I've used FVB after some idiots hit my car. They do great work, as you can see by the picture. Professional and courteous staff. There's a Enterprise rental car a couple blocks up the street on Newhope, which makes it very convenient if you need a rental. Enterprise will even pick you up and drop you off at FVB. Just have someone at FVB call Enterprise to come pick you up. Getting in a car accident always sucks, but at least these two companies make the whole process easier on you.< /review>

<Review>5 Star experience. They had my car looking brand new after a rear end collision. The work was done in a timely fashion. My car was cleaned and smelled great inside upon receiving it. I would highly recommend all of their services. The staff was friendly, very helpful, and kept me well informed throughout the whole process. Thank you Fountain Valley Bodyworks.</Review>< pictures>

They are very helpful, organized, and cheerful. Let's face it, you're not there for a good reason, but at least everyone is very cheerful and upbeat. I've seen the owner walking around several times, and once he even gave me a ride home! It is VERY obvious that they are held to a high standard of customer service. They never disappoint.

Took my car in after I got hit. When I received my car back everything seemed ok. After a couple weeks of getting my car detailed I notice the paint wasn’t matching the rest of the car. It was a really rough finish , so I took it back and they agreed to re-paint. Once i received the car back I noticed they had left paint on my brand new $900 rims. Very noticeable since my rims were black and the paint was silver. They also left my back cameras covered in paint as well. Later I noticed my trunk wasn’t aligned right , I had a hard time closing it. There was other minor things that got me disappointed. Overall the staff was very professional but the quality of their work was poor. Wouldn’t recommend this place, now I have to pay out of pocket to fix the things they couldn’t properly do.< /text>

Honestly, I can't say enough good things about this place. My vehicle had major damage after an accident and I just assumed it was never going to be the same again. What made it even worse was that it was still fairly new. I ended up taking it to a few different places for estimates and that's how I found this place. The sales manager Shane Keheian immediately made me feel confident that they could handle the job and they went above and beyond my high expectations. Shane handled everything with my insurance adjuster, all I had to do was hand him the key. Fast forward four months later, I had a minor issue that was totally unrelated to any repairs they had done and I called Shane. He told me to bring the car in and a few hours later he called me and told me they fixed it free of charge. Not many places go above and beyond but this place certainly does. If you've ever been in an accident or need work done, I highly recommend this place. Ask for Shane Keheian, you'll be happy you did.</text>

My truck was stolen & as soon as it was recovered my insurance allowed me to decide which auto body shop I wanted to send it to. So I decided to go with FV Body shop.. literally the worst place I could’ve taken it to. They were working on my car for a little bit over a month and just giving me the runaround about when my vehicle would be completed. They never called me to provide updates, I was always the one calling.

My dad ended up getting irritated with the way they kept giving me the runaround and decided to call them to get an update. Same day he called my advisor, Morgan, told him the vehicle was done.  He didn’t call me to let me know, he simply told my dad it was done and he could pick it up. *** not once had I ever told Morgan my fathers name or given authorization for it to be released to him***
Yet he released the vehicle to my father, which is no biggie, but does that mean anyone can go and claim they know any owner and just take a car like that?
Extremely unprofessional.  & not even everything was done correctly or as promised.< /Text>

I got rear ended by some clown in Anaheim who wasn't paying attention to traffic. Took my 2018 Audi Q5 to Fountain Valley Bodyworks within a few hours. Shane saw my car, gave it a good glance, and let me know when to generally expect my car returned in tip top shape. He was professional, thorough, knowledgeable, and friendly. You cannot ask for more.

When I came to pick up my car, I gave him a very nice gift for the impeccable timing and perfect work on my car. Drives like a dream once again.<//Review>

<Review>I’m very happy with the end result. My only complaint is that it took twice to achieve it. I understand things happen, and it’s how you finish that matters, so I’m satisfied with how they handled the situation. Otherwise I would have given five stars</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I bought a 2014 VW convertible for my wife at a very good price as it had some minor headlamp damage and various paint scrapes and a couple of shopping cart dents.  I called up Fountain Valley Bodyworks as My previous experience was great and spoke with Morgan,  he was clear, professional, and went to great detail, he gave me an approximate price and I felt good about the work they would.do. In a nutshell,   I just picked up the car and couldn’t be happier!!  Great job all round and Morgan is a great Ambassador for the Company.< /Text>

<Review>I brought in my car for body work and was going through insurance. I heard back a Day or so later (Friday) that it would take about 3 weeks to complete in order to get the parts in. I have a clean energy vehicle and they were supposed to call me on Monday to let me know when the stickers were removed so I could pick them up. I didn’t hear back from Jose until I reached out 2.5 weeks later to find out the status. At this time, I was told that it was going to take about 4 weeks and that “he didn’t want to bother me because he thought I was on vacation”. If my car is at your shop, I want to know what’s going on. Even if I am on vacation, you can call and leave a message if I don’t pick up. I was told I would get another call the next day to verify the date it would be completed and didn’t hear back (day before thanksgiving). That’s fine, people are getting ready for the holidays. Ultimately, the timeline kept getting Pushed back an additional 2 weeks and here we are, 1.5 months later and I am finally able to get my car.

The work seems to be good, but there was no communication from Jose throughout the process, and when there was, it was due to me calling or texting for an update. The expectation of 3 weeks was set initially, and it took double that time. My family have taken multiple cars here for bodywork over the past 10 years, but this is it for us. I would highly recommend people look elsewhere for body work if you are on a timeline or like to be informed of the progress of your repair. 1 Star for customer service.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Time>1576172812734</Time>< user_name>

For what I paid and the results I got, I’ll keep coming back here for all my body work needs on my car!! Super professional, not to mention the utmost cleanliness in regards to dealing with COVID. They even got me a Lyft home when I dropped my car off. :-) everything was A1 all around!

We bottomed out our car on a steep hill and broke a couple of plastic pieces underneath.  We took it to Fountain Valley Bodyworks and Noe had it fixed in one day.  Not only did he wash the car but detailed the whole inside.  The car hasn't looked that good since we bought it.  Thanks, Noe.  You're the best.< /Text>

Had a great experience with Fountain Valley Bodyworks. Took my car in for a new bumper and passenger doors which were damaged in an accident.The staff was friendly and very professional, explained everything to me in detail, gave me options on parts needing to be replaced and had me in the loop in the progress of my car as it was being repaired. My car looked brand new when they were done. They did an amazing job and even buffed out my hazy headlights. Will use them again if needed. They also provided a great warranty on their work. Great job Fountain Valley Bodyworks.< /Review>

When I first entered the shop I was instantly greeted by all 3 people at the desk which was extremely nice considering sometimes you walk into a business and never get greeted at all. As soon as I started to Jim Hall he made the whole process completely painless and handled all the paperwork with the insurance. They were easy to work with and friendly. Awesome work!!<//Review>

<Review>The entire team did a great job, from the initial consultation, to regular and frequent updates on the progress and timeline, to the handoff of the finished product. They were all great.  And Brian went above and beyond By touching up a little spot ‘outside the work order area’ that could use some painting.

Took my car in with the expectation of getting in back in 1 or 2 days; to my surprise it was ready the same day.  The repairs were made and my car was clean inside and out.  Service beyond expectations.<//review>

<Text>Very professional and they keep you up to date step by step. My rep was Brian, and I couldn’t be happier with the entire process. Everything went quick and smoothly and communication was perfect. I didn’t get any calls with issues and problems, they just solved everything with insurance and only called me for good news. I’d recommend this place for everyone.<//Text>< name>

from The moment I walked in until the finished work on my vehicle was professional, kept me informed of the progress of the job, and they took pride in their work.  The quality of the job from experienced mechanics and technicians, from reception to management was excellent.  My car is my baby and was well taken care of.  I trust the work of committed staff of FV Auto Bodyworks.< /review>

I have been driving by this shop everyday for work and see people come out with the smile. Since I get hit at the back bumper, I decide to give it a chance. The work they have done is amazing and Jose helps me to deal with other party’s insurance to get the entire bumper fix. However, the time management is just little bit disappointed but it is forgivable. Thank you Jose and all the staff for helping my car looks amazing as it should be.<//text>

Are there dozens of body shops near that you could choose? Yes. Will they fix your car? Yes. Will it be done well and on time? Who knows? Will they treat you like their only customer? Like a member of the family? Probably not... but that’s what Fountain Valley Bodyworks does.

It takes a lot for me to bother with a review but…I’ve been to FV Bodyworks 4 times (don’t judge me-only once was my fault). The first time was on a friend’s referral, but I keep coming back because it’s the only place I will choose for bodywork on my cars.

It seems almost impossible to find quality customer service not to mention expert craftsmanship but FV Bodyworks does just that. I can only explain it by observing that it’s a culture that manager Mike Honrath encourages.

My last visit was on 7-1-20 and, unlike the other times, I didn’t leave my car overnight. I just needed a new bumper, so I went down and paid for a bumper and set an appointment for a replacement. When I returned, I waited for the new bumper to be attached. While I was sitting and reading, I was astounded by all the customers who came in for a variety of reasons and were all treated as excellently as I had become accustomed to. A flurry of activity with extra sanitizing due to Covid going on with employees working hard at their jobs but always kind and professional to customers and each other. Employees who had no need to interact with me still smiled, said hello and offered assistance.

Knowledgeable, expert, on time, willing to go the extra mile and make anything right, clean finished product, on time AND will treat you with respect and dignity. What a great place! I hope I never have to go back but, if the need arises, I will return ONLY to FV Bodyworks.</Text>

Fountain Valley Bodyworks does “Superlative” work!

Always gracious and professional, extremely helpful, and every single time I get my car back, the work they have done looks “Showroom!”

Congrats, Shaine, amazing work once again, seriously,
I would never go any place else to have work done on any of my cars. Shaine, excellent work, back to me before the time promised, and always done with a smile! Bravo!

All of their staff is amazing, and kudos to Sandra for always taking special and excellent care of me!

Well done everyone!!!

I have used Fountain Valley for a number of cars. Jim Woods was great. Communicated all the steps and exceeded time expectations. Too often reviews are filled with negativity, wish I could type more- but when they do everything right, leaves little to say. This shop’s logo of a smiley face is very fitting. Thanks again!< /text>

I’ve lived just up the street from this place on Newhope for 20 years and this is the first time I’ve been into their shop! 100% satisfied, excellent service and turnaround time. This was a repair covered by insurance and everything was completely worked out before I even dropped off the car after having gotten an estimate the week prior. I hope I don’t have to go back but if I do I know I’ll be in great hands.< /Text>

This is the second time we have used Fountain Valley Bodyworks for a vehicle repair. They do excellent work and actually finished a day earlier than they estimated.  Best of all is their frequent communication with us providing updates throughout the process. We highly recommend them.< /Review>

The work done was great. My insurance wanted to save money by using refurbished parts for the structure which is important for the safety of the vehicle but FVB insisted on OEM. They took time to make sure the vehicle ran smoothly. I’m very happy with the work.<//Text>

We were referred to Fountain Valley Body Works by a friend. First, thank you to our friend for the referral. Now, a BIG thanks to Mike Honrath, the general manager, for all that he helped us with on our car after our accident. He was so professional and actually caring not only for the car but for the owners of the car. The staff was tremendous also. Thank you again Mike for making us feel special and for helping us get through this ordeal. You are #1 in what you do. I recommend Fountain Valley Body Works to everyone who wants honesty and integrity.</Text>

I was looking for a place to get my car bumber fixed and I  brought it here after reading all the great reviews on Yelp. Shane did an amazing job fixing my car bumper and my car is looking better than I've ever seen it look before. Shane kept in contact with me and let me know what was going on with the insurance company and my car every step of the way. I definitely recommend<//Text>

At the end of the process the work was done to a quality level. The estimate process was professional and prompt.Jose was good at explaining the work that needed to be done. All staff that I made contact with were friendly and appeard to like their work. The initial time frame was for completion in 5 working..this was approximate , not promised. To my dissapointment it took two full extra days to complete the job. This resulted in an additional cost to for me for car rental. Some communication  on the part of the shop was lacking when things on my job had some problems.<//text>

<text>Alex helped me with a quote and through the process. His quote was $300 bucks less than some other estimates, plus when there was a delay (not their fault) he even comped a little work. Overall great decision and even though I’m in Irvine, I’ll be back here for my next fix.

FOUNTAIN VALLEY BODY WORKS did a great job on my car.  I was rear ended and Trevor communicated with me the whole time my car was in the shop.  He let me know what was going on every step of the way.  When I got my car back it looked BRAND NEW!  I would definitely recommend them to anyone who needs body work on their vehicle.</Text>

This is the first time I’ve ever taken my car to be repaired, and I’m very satisfied with Fountain Valley Body Works. Trevor was the one fixing my car and he constantly updated me about the progress and what was going on with my vehicle. I greatly appreciated this, because this was my first automobile accident and Fountain Valley Body Works made me feel confident that my car will be taken care of. I just got my car back and it looks and feels like I was never in an accident.<//Text>

Excellent services! Starting with John (original estimator), Trevor and Sandy!
Brought our car in on Friday, and John told me that work will not start till Monday and will be done by Friday. Well, got the our car today (Wednesday) two days before i was quoted for.
Car looks looks brand new before the dealer!
Thank you FV Bodyworks!
Keep the great work  :)< /Text>

Wasn’t sure what to expect due to my car being a redesign and as the manager Alex jokes with me that my 2019 Rav4 was probably the first one they saw I was nervous but after receiving my car I am beyond happy and grateful on how good my car looks. Will definitely be back if any issues come up again and Fountain Valley Bodyworks has earned my trust and will be a continued customer.<//text>

The wonderful ladies up front  were the best first impression with their warm smiles and going above and beyond to help me get a rental car while i left mine there. Then my adjuster Shane was so informative and prompt, he made sure i was updated every step of the way. lastly the body work was top notch, i mean it best experience with a body shop. Thank you all the F.V body you made this experience easy, especially when just getting into a car accident you dont want to deal with B.S.. :)<//review>< date>

Thank you to Horacio, Michael and the entire staff of Fountain Valley Bodyworks at 18125 Euclid Street in Fountain Valley,  for taking such
excellent care of me.  I understand why your shop is voted the best bodyshop in Orange County.  I will never go anywhere else for my vehicle repair needs.  I highly recommend this company for any vehicle that is in need of body work.

I've rated Fountain Valley Bodyworks five stars because they excel in all areas of business.  Knowledgeable and friendly customer service, exceptional and rapid repair work and more than reasonable pricing.

I pulled in on a Friday evening for a price quote.  I made an appointment that was convenient for me.  I was in and out of there in 10 minutes.
I returned on Wednesday morning and Horacio remembered what I was there for.  Originally I was told the repair would take approximately 2 hours; and, to my surprise, Horacio had my car repaired in 30 minutes.  An even bigger surprise was that, even though I was super happy with the original quote to repair, I was charged even less than the original quote!!!

Here's the icing on the cake.  Horacio knew I was upset about a couple tiny scratches on the side of my car that was not related or part of the accident quote.  Horacio surprised me by taking it upon himself to buff out and paint the scratches at no charge.  My car looks brand new again and I could not be happier.  Now that's excellent and caring customer service.

The two girls at the desk were a complete pleasure to work with on both Friday and Wednesday.  Michael, the owner, made sure that I was completely satisfied with the work as I was paying my bill.  Horacio walked me to my car as I was leaving.

Exceptional Customer Service from the Entire Company.
Free Quotes.
Fair and Reasonable Pricing.
Excellent and Rapid Repair Work.

The yellow happy face on the side of your building represents you well.
I drove off extremely happy with the entire experience.  I have already recommended you to friends and family.  I hope I don't have another accident, but if I do, I will be back to see you again.

Thank you so much!<//Text>

<Review>The cost estimate was not  prefaced with the potential that once they open up the door to see the damage that there might be more cost or possible replacement of the door which their was. This was a private party that paid me on the original quote so I was out of pocket over $600 more. Work quality was good. Lastly they should have had me look at the car with someone representing the company stlll there instead just give me the key after driving the car up and leave me outside. Interesting way to wrap up my experience with the company? Hope that helps but they are busy maybe just understaffed on a Saturday?</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

BEWARE: They do not stand by their lifetime warranty/work.

I had my car repaired here almost a year and a half ago and they did what I thought was a phenomenal job. However, as time went on, I noticed paint chipping off from where they did their repair. Today, I brought my car back to the shop and was expecting them to fix it for me due to their lifetime warranty. HOWEVER, they gave me the run around and told me that the size of my rims caused the paint damage, and that they would not repair the paint chipping under their lifetime warranty. I went and compared the repaired side to the other side of the car (the side with no repairs needed) and found that there were no paint chipping off on that side. Shocking. This led me to think, “Why is the paint on the repaired side coming off, and the nonrepaired side is totally fine?” If the rims are the problem, both sides should be having the same issues, but no…only the side that’s been repaired is having the paint chipping issues.

I am extremely disappointed. Fountain Valley Body Works was my go-to place for any type of car repairs, but after this experience, never again. I will no longer refer any of my friends or family to this body shop.<//review>

To: Fountain Valley Body Works
Got the car today. It was raining. We’ve been to your business several times and a man always comes out to present the car. Today, the man said to my wife, “there’s your car parked over there,”and stayed inside. That’s understandable and I your work has never had an issue. She didn’t go back in to report the smell because she had a doctors appointment and didn’t have more time. She also hoped that the smell would fade away.
Did you spray the seats and carpet with something or did someone there spill a bottle of cheap cologne inside the car. It’s DISGUSTING and I’m allergic to cheap perfume. It makes me sneeze, makes my lungs choke up like asthma and eyes water.
We had all four doors open in the garage but no help.  Once we turn on the heater or AC the car will stink forever.
Please get the oder out of our car.

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I've been to this shop a couple times over the years, but before there was any kind of social media to review businesses like this.  So when someone damaged my left-rear door, this was the only place I seriously considered.

I now live over an hour away, so I looked at shops in my area first.  However, I was really concerned about the quality of the repairs and the painter's ability to match the color (3-stage, pearl white).  Based on my memory of past experiences with Fountain Valley Bodyworks, I was hoping my drive would still be worth it, and I'm glad I made that call.

I had an idea to repair (not replace) the door, to save me from blending the adjacent quarter panel.  Mike Honrath took his time and rationally discussed the repairs with me, and I'm really glad he did.  What we ended up doing, replacing the door, was a far better "repair" than what I was previously considering.  I didn't want to blend the adjacent quarter panel or do anything to the factory paint, but Mike convinced me that it was the better repair and he was right.

Based on Mr. Honrath's suggestion, I was also able to save a little money when calling Enterprise Rent-A-Car (located right down the street) by mentioning that I was getting my car repaired at FV Bodyworks.  It couldn't have worked out any better than it did.

FV Bodyworks staff was friendly, and made the whole process great (considering it was an already bad situation of having to fix my car).  Mike Honrath, particularly, really ended up making me feel comfortable with everything that was needed and done to my car.

I've been to other body shops before going here the first time.  There is a reason why they are voted the #1 Body Shop in all of Orange County for five years in a row; and there is a reason why a person like Mike Honrath is in the position he is, and has worked there for as long as he has.  If I ever need additional work on my car, I will be going here again.

Thank you FV Bodyworks, and THANK YOU Mike!</Text>< Pics>

<Rating>3</Rating><Review>Brought the car in for a broken tail light and dented fender.

First of all only one employee behind the the counter doing all the intakes, deliveries, and answering the phone. It took almost an hour to get my car.

Once we got the car and before we left the shop, the backup light did not work and when the head lights were turned the bash lights went out. Needless to say we had to leave it there until Monday.

The car itself looked very clean but the chrome rims were dirty.

I would have rated them higher if not for these major issues.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

< Review>
I was very pleased with the customer service and repairs from Fountain Valley Body Works.  I was rear ended in my 2011 Hyndai Elantra and State Farms Insurance recommended that I take my car there.  The estimator was extremely helpful and told me about their $350 bumper special.  They were able to fix the bumper quickly and the paint job was spot on!  I really couldn't tell at all that damage had been done to my car when I picked it up.  The workers were friendly, professional, and proactive about fixing my car on time (I didn't have to call to ask if my car was done yet, like I've had to do at other body shops in the past).  I highly recommend FVBW Express and I'll definitely take a car back there if I need to (fingers crossed for no more fender benders!).< /Review>

Like the strip custom painting.
1) Do not like that: licence plate lights are black plastic not orig.Chrome when replaced.
My option was drop off M-F during my work hours and leave it. Take a day off--no
2) Tow receiver replaced with lower bulky one that lock will not fit.
3) R/R rear bed- Air bag line would not work, found out when hooking up boat. They repaired with elect. tape.
4) The tail gate would not open 2 months later, they did not check or replace clips, just painted them.  Last but least,
5) I had my Snug cover painted, you can still see the lines from previous stripping, I paid extra to have taken care of.
6) No rush here, behind the desk they are multitasking constantly and the wait is on you. I had to have them find my receiver for my custom insert, it took 3 trips....< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Very disappointed with FV Bodyworks. They charged me for a tow that was covered by AAA. They started unauthorized repairs and tried to charge me labor for the unauthorized work.  They lost my hardware, then lied to me and told me the tech put it in my truck bed.  Mike Honrath, the GM was very unprofessional, unhelpful and rude.  I would never go there again, nor would I recommend them to anyone.</Review>

Very rude barista was confrontational in his tone for no reason. Totally unusual for a Starbucks where they’re usually very friendly at other locations. Will not come back to this one and others please be advised.<//review>

This location is about the most comfortable Starbucks that I've been in. The Baristas are wonderful, always a great coffee drink. I wish they stayed open a little later, but I have nothing but praise for the team.</text>

<Text>This is a great friendly Starbucks.  I know most are friendly but the staff here are particularly nice.  Always remember your name and your usual drink.  Nice size for hanging out and recharging yourself with a cup of coffee.  Lots of tables and chairs.<//Text>< pics>

Not returning here, waited 5 mins for a dry cappuccino, explained nicely to the guy that it was a latte he made and not a dry cappuccino.  Waited again while he serves a couple of other drinks, hmm, then get exactly the same drink he gave me the first time.  I just left - need to find a new place with someone who listens or knows how to make a simple drink:(< /Review>

I spend every weekend doing homework here. It is very spacious and clean. Staff is friendly and inviting. Staff is very willing to make their customers happy. They are very willing to redo orders when they make a mistake or if the customer is not happy with their order.< /review>

<Review>My favorite starbuck's location.  Staff is fast and make the best fraps.  Comfortable location (thanks for the seat pads on the wooden chairs!).  The wifi there is near unusable.  Fix that and I'll add a star.</Review>< gmapID>

The baristas are great, I've only been a few time and when I order, they seem to know my drink. Unfortunately, I don't think the girl making the drinks is always on her game in the morning. A few days ago I ordered an iced macchiato and she made it hot and today I ordered the same and had to watch her to stop her from making the same mistake, only to be given one shot of espresso in a venti drink... The equivalent of drinking favored milk. I know it gets busy when drinks are backed up and that the cup I bring in is insulated (for this I excuse the hot vs. iced confusion) but not knowing how many shots to put in a drink is kind of crucial to properly making drinks.< /Text>

<text>Staff is friendly and pretty consistent on quality in this location, but they remodeled and added a big community table and counter seating, so there are not many tables inside.<//text>< gmapID>

<text>Never been there before. Reuben was the person there to help me and he did a 5 star job for $2.30 (cost of the bubble envelope)

I saw how low their rating was and wanted to share this good experience.

Everyone seems to go out of their way to complain but not so much when it all goes better than expected

Thank you Reuben!< /text>< Pictures>

This review is for Bobby and the crew at this store. Lately, I have noticed a big improvement with this store's customer service and wait time. After chatting with Bobby, I came to found out that this store is under new management and servicing changes have been made. The "can do" attitude and sense of urgency to get customers safely in and out is utterly even more important in the midst of this pandemic. Kudos to this amazing team!<//text>

Very rude people. Everytime I ask for help, no one was helping. I used their computer for like 8 mins (I had my stopwatch set up) and the guy charge me for 3.00 twice. Be aware of what they are charging you because they add extra. I live in hickey blvd but I still drive to ups westborough (even same ownership) but the people there are way much much nicer! Excellent customer service in ups wesrborough unlike un ups hickey! -zero star for this branch!</review>

** Under new management!

As of October 2018, Bobby and Mohit (you may have seen them at the Westborough UPS Store) are running the place and it's a much better experience than before. They are super friendly and the location is not as busy (yet), so I was able to ship my package very quickly.< /Review>

BEWARE! RIP OFF! These Indian guys are a joke! They wanted to charge me $3.00 for 1 single page in black and white!!! Since THEY printed it using a computer, and that’s the cost of using it even though I didn’t even touched it, but only sent an email with my file attached. Of course they didn’t mention that before, No way I was going to pay that.</Text>

I've been here a few times and I've always been helped by Michael who is pleasant to work with.  I think UPS is an expensive solution, but I have always had my packages arrive on time or early and never damaged.  Also, it is nice you can just bring an unpackaged item and they will pack it for you, though there is a $10 custom pack fee.<//review>

The Indian was extremely hostile to me. Once I returned a package. I put the label into a label bag and handed it to him. He said to me rudely, "this is drop off only!" and asked me to tear off the sticker. I was pissed off.
The other day, I also went there for drop off. I didn't tape the box I was going to return. Then, the Indian old guy asked me to buy the tape from him. I said other UPS can do that for free. He again said, "I don't know about others, here you need to buy tape." I was mad again.

Friends, the only suggestion I have is never waste your time going there. Avoid at any cose.

I gave this location another shot, mainly because the new franchise owners are thoughtful enough to go through all of the hate mail on GMaps. If they care enough to do that, then they certainly care more about customer service than the previous operators. Confirmed by my trip today. Upgrading to 5/5 to help a small business out.

-------------------
Dropped off a package here the other day and - can confirm that there's a certain gentleman who works here and could be described as "rude". Maybe something got lost in translation.

Hey, my package got where it was supposed to go, so I can't complain too much.</Text>< Pictures>

<Pics>None< /Pics><rate>1</rate><review>Wow. I thought I'd give this place a chance and I should have listened to the reviews. The "gentleman" does not listen, isn't aware of how UPS works  and keeps saying he's a private business, he's pushy and tries to charge you for the strangest things, hostile, and sliiiiighty misogynist (I really don't like to throw that word around).

Anyway, pass if you have questions or issues. If you just need to drop things off and leave, this place is suitable enough. Otherwise, pass.<//review></record>

Yes, all the reviews are true. The man is very rude...! Let me politely begin! Went to the store around 2:00pm, there was one person ahead of me in line while one person was already being helped. It is now 2:15 and I am still waiting in the same spot. The lady who was being helped by the Indian man, was getting quite impatient as it seemed he didn't know what he was talking about. The customer had a question about when her package was set to arrive to it's location. The man rudely said, "IT WILL GET THERE, WHEN IT GET'S THERE" in an almost shouting tone. The rest of us in the line were shocked to how he responded to her question. They were going back and forth for another 5 minutes figuring out the details when the line started growing. I needed to just drop off a package and be on my way. When he noticed the length of the line when he just told me to leave the package on the counter. I called the store several hours later and asked if my package went through, since I simply left it on the counter and didn't get a receipt, and again with such a tone said "if you left a package here, it is not in my hands, so idk where it is".... I am going to pray my package gets to where it needs to go!!! Please don't go here!!!!<//Review>

Very bad experience!! The guy there was rude and knows nothing. I have some important documents to be delivered at San Francisco but they came back to me so I tried again but 2nd time also they came back to me. My docs never got delivered and I have to then use FedEx. I asked the guy so many times to tell me if I am missing something but they just took the money for delivery and the docs were never delivered. Wastage of time money. Never go to this place!!<//Review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Drop off a package today, I received worst service! The Indian customer service works over there, is extremely rude! Don't go there if you can.
I drove 20 mins from work during lunch break to drop off a package. Because it's drop off so I didn't bring my wallet. When I get there I found out the box isn't sealed. So I asked whether I could have 1 inch or shorter tape. However, the Indian guy work over there said I must pay for 1 dollar for that, otherwise, I need to come back later.  Another customer also came over drop off stuff. He is so generous gave me 1 dollar without asking. I appreciate a lot. But the Indian customer service was so ridiculous, he also angry at that customer helped me out because he gave me 1 dollar. Extremely bad service!< /review>< Date>

This spot is a great new place for us. Came in the evening to check it out and to our surprise it was amazing. Cozy and set up is different than most Thai Cuisines.
Their Thai ice tea came in a unique way and was delicious.
Service was outstanding, our waitress told our little one that she was cute and she gave the waitress a big hug before leaving, she not ever doe's that to unknown people.
We highly recommend this restaurant and will return.<//Text>

<review>Love this place. They seem to be making their pad Thai differently though, it usually has more sauce and flavor instead of just spice. But otherwise it's really good.< /review>< user_name>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Suki Time Thai Kitchen is me and my wife's favorite Thai restaurant (and restaurant in general). We come here fairly often (every few weeks or so) and order something new during each visit. The main favorite item to order is their Thai coconut coffee - it is far more flavorful and delicious than any coffee franchise, and comes in a very large bottle. All in all, every meal we have ordered has never disappointed, and the staff are all incredibly sweet, attentive, and helpful. We never feel rushed out of the restaurant when we are near the end of our meals, and the prices are also more than reasonable. This place will always be one of our fondest memories shared in Lomita. Thank you, Suki Time!<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>Excellent and Tasty Thai Food and Hot Pot. Delicious broths and sauces make this place a standout.  Tom Yum soup or Tom Yum with Coconut Milk is excellent as a hot pot soup base, it imparts a wonderful flavor to everything cooked in it. Quick friendly service and fair prices make this a definite repeat visit candidate.</Review>< Pictures>

I have been coming to this restaurant for the past 2 years, there is not enough room to write about this great place! The atmosphere is great, the food is very delicious, and the waiters are excellent hosts! If you want to try delicious Thai food, this is the best! I love their soups and the variety they serve. Their Thai tea is the best! The waiters are warm, welcoming, and attentive. They value their costumers very much! My wife and I  recently received a mug and our own Thai tea to make at home! If that doesn't show customer appreciation, I don't know what does! I love this place. I posted a picture of the gift we received from them!<//Text>

I like this spot! They serve high quality meals, they have a nice menu, The cook in that place is well trained, I like a lot tasting all their dishes. The dishes are always good, the service towards the clients  is agreeable. I often go to  this restaurant and I not even once was unhappy. I recommend it to all my friends.</text>

I went on a date here, as I wanted to try something new, and it was a great idea. The broths are full of flavour. I almost wanted to finish the entire bowl by myself, but I was too full. Oh yeah, it's super filling, too.  I also had a Thai tea that is probably the best thai tea I've ever had--and I've had a LOT of them.<//Text>

After Corona, eating out was virtually impossible, along came these nice folks with a patio and their willingness to serve us their delicious food. We finally had a meal outside our home.</review>

The hot pot was a total let down. They just took the Japanese style hot pot and put out some Thai style sauces. It wasn't that great. Their other food looked more promising but the hot pot was pretty uninspiring. Being that they advertise as a hot pot place but their hot pot sucks I don't know if they'll stay open long.< /review>

The food here is really good, but the service sucks! There was only one other table being served and our server barely came out to check on us. They brought out our hot pot, but didn't give us any bowls to eat it! It took like 10 minutes for them to come out finally and get us bowls. They brought out our meat but took 10 more minutes to get the sides we ordered. Maybe it was just one of those days. But 2 stars for this visit.<//Review>

This place has great; no frills Thai food. I loved the papaya salad and the boat noodle soup. The manager was super friendly and we enjoyed a great conversation about Thailand with him - that's good customer service for you! The manager makes sure you have a great time and actually cares about his customers. I've only given 4 because portions sizes are really small.</review>

Nice Thai place. Pretty authentic. Good for a quick bite. The Tom yum soup is really sweet. Be warned. Lol and the beef in the beef and basil is ground, which I've never seen before but it was OK. Nothing special.<//Review>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>Really great Thai food place that is very unassuming, it has an outdoor seating area at the entrance with Thai decor and a medium size seating area inside. We chose half Tum Yum soup and Poh Tak, we added our favorite spices and cooked our beef and pork belly inside each soup. I went with my girlfriend and it was a fun experience being able to control the pot and cooking it together... definitely something different for us than the usual which we enjoyed. Actually was a lucky find because we originally tried to go to Gen Korean BBQ but the wait was ridiculous; so happy and will be going back soon.<//review><UserId.>105566675770254684121<//UserId.></record>

Nice place for Dinner and Lunch, I've tried both. The Thai food is good, and I've tried most all the good Thai places in LA. Tonight I tried the shabu shabu and was impressed.  The seafood platter was very fresh and the difference sauces add just the right amount of taste. It's kind of like 2 restaurants in one. It's a large place, so I like that it has no wait, I would recommend<//text>

<name>lynn webster</name><Text>I ordered via website which offered free delivery. Within 5 minutes of the order, I received a call from the restaurant saying they were in the weeds and didn't have certain items. I was okay with the substitutions and the fact that it would be an hour for delivery. It was 2 hours later that we received our food and it was the first time I received food that was inedible--not all but one dish in particular. Do not order anything with beef from this restaurant. There is no quality control. I have never not been able to eat the beef from any  restaurant before but this beef was full of grisle and inedible. I called several times during the second hour to see if my food was actually coming. No one answered the phone. EVER. I left messages and received a free thai ice tea and an apology. Was this worth it. NO! I am sad considering the number of great reviews.<//Text><user_id>112964078528318847177< /user_id>< pictures>

Great food (shabu shabu), great service, nice ambiance, convenient parking and prices are reasonable.  Wish there’s a place like this out here in TX.  I really missed this place and can’t wait to get back here for the delicious hot pot!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Horrible service,  my friend recommended this place Asian guy in front called him stupid in so many words,  so we're had a much more delightful dinner at a1 bbq in lomita. Fire that guy, you are losing clients because of his attitude!!< /Text>

<Text>I love dell taco for myself and the kiddos. Value boxes are yummy and filling. The chicken tacos have some delicious cream sauce. The shrimp tacos are delicious and the value strawberry lemonade are what summers are made for. This location seems to be clean and quick.</Text><gmapID>0x809b201e17a18231:0x629fb84a4f155f02<//gmapID>< Rating>

<text>It's a Del Taco - beans made fresh, in-house, along with their grilled chicken (awesome in a taco or burrito), and grated cheese.  Glad to see that they don't use caulking guns for their sour cream and other sauces, or have to rip open boil-bags of refried beans and meat, like that other taco chain.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbgMq6K6ufXOkngd2X2EKwCa0AJR6eZNDWzTht=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfyYuTbIqmE_VA3AUKW5SK_XRJvFWrgKycnIM8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

I love Del Taco better than Taco Bell. They use real ingredients. My fave is their bean and cheese burrito with red and green sauce.</Text>

<Text>It's a mixed bag. The one off of Douglas usually has a long line on Tuesday (Value taco night) but it's worth it if you endure the wait. You unfortunately I rolled through the drive thru today (Apr 6) and was greeted by the guy saying the card reader was not working. I rolled my eyes, but understood since it was busy. Ended up going to T bell down the street.

Usually I like saying a dollar here on Tuesday/Thursdays, (Chicken taco night) sadly the long wait and inconvenient Card Reader error is making it hard for me to want to stop by this DT just to wait 15 minutes, to hear I can't use my card.< /Text><rating>2</rating></record>

I think they skipped training for the employees here. They were lacking quickness, customer service skills...and a decent amount of toppings on my food, definitely not worth the money going to this location. The Arden way & Howe ave location is so much better.<//Review>

Keep your order simple, the workers seem to get the order wrong about 25% of the time so stick to simple items. For instance, order 1 item from value menu. Don't order a combo.  This is from my experience using the drive thru.< /text>

<text>Customer service was on point! They didn't have what we wanted but gave great suggestions which we really appreciated. The food was fast, hot and delicious. The value was incredible! I didn't know how reasonably priced they were. We will return. Highly recommend.</text><user_name>Jessica Paulin< /user_name><user>107223515548051305044< /user><resp>None</resp>< rate>

<Review>Ordered their grilled chicken tacos, the sauce that comes on it tasts just like mayo and it came on only one side of the taco. Although that part happened to be a good thing because i ripped that side off, if the sauce tasted better then mayo i would have been more unsatisfied.< /Review><resp>None<//resp><userid>115190700019963211067<//userid><pictures>None<//pictures>< gmapID>

<Text>The food at this Del Taco was really good! My burrito was fast and delicious! The cashier on the other hand was quite rude. I ordered an ice tea and asked for sweetener and she gave me two lil sweeteners and a dirty look. I ordered a medium drink and it was at least 32 oz lol with very little ice!  Two lil sweeteners don't quite give enough!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Great restaurant, great service. Use the phone app, food is discounted enormously, and you can use multiple coupons from the app in one transaction. Make sure you have them scan coupons that require a $5 total purchase First, then use any $3 ones, then use free item coupons next. Always scan highest first, in that order in order to get massive discounts! Happy eating 😊<//Review>

<Text>Missing items, cold fries, broken shake machine, and out of ice coffee. Worse del taco experience I've ever had. Will not be back!

Edit: General manager called and offered a make up meal, was a better experience but not perfect. All my items we're shoved into one bag and there was still a missing item. At least when I went back this time they had ice coffee and the french fries were hot. Earned a bump up to three stars from me. Still needs improvement.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Rating>

Asked for fresh fries and was given old, cold fries. No concern for being given decent food. Waited for 15 -20 mins for 4 cars to place orders, very slow service. Del carbon taco, corn tortilla was soggy & old also.< /Text>

Good food, speedy delivery. The owner was working alongside her employees serving the customers.

Reynada thanks for running a great business in Roseville. We appreciate the service you and your employees offer.< /text>

<Text>Listen folks, it's cheap fast food. I think it's good considering the price point. Also, expect a long wait on Tuesday and Thursday evenings possibly 20 mins+ in drive-through. I knew what I was getting into, but I just play on my phone while I wait to move up in line. I like the crispy chicken tacos, reminds me of the mcd's snack wrap, maybe better. I like their chicken more than their beef imo. You decide for yourself but don't judge too harshly, because for me, the value tips the scales to good.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x809b201e17a18231:0x629fb84a4f155f02< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

We just wanted an Epic Cali with Beyond, but they could only do the meat ones. We like meat, but we wanted to try out the Beyond menu so it was a frustrating experience. The outside menu also didn't have a screen to let us know what we ordered and the guy couldn't hear me! Left without a few things we wanted, but the gentleman at the window was nice enough.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

< Review>
First time visiting a "Del Taco" and was impressed. Very similar to "Taco Bell" but with several burgers available on the menu. Fast friendly drive thru with a perfectly filled order. Dollar menu is great!! Easy to navigate location.
Full family approval! Kids enjoyed the burgers and fries while the wife and I enjoyed tacos nachos and chips.
I would rank slightly better than "Taco Bell".. "Del Taco" had more of a "fresh" taste in my opinion and a less expensive alternative.
Will definately return again soon!!</Review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>Another Del taco destination that did not disappoint. This Del taco was the freshest and cleanest that I had ever been in. There are vegan options on the menu as well as salads. The customer service was absolutely phenomenal and I got my food very quickly. I usually wait for a spell for my food, however, this location was spot-on Johnny rocket. The food came out clean and quickly. If I am in the mood for cheap Mexican inspired food, I will never go to Taco Bell again. I live one mile away from this location and it will be my location for all of my munchie meals. #420< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x809b201e17a18231:0x629fb84a4f155f02</gmapID></record>

<Review>Slow service, waited an extra 10 minutes for cold, floppy re-fries. I thought at least with the wait, the fries would be hot and crispy, instead they were yesterday's fries. Never received a receipt (but they knew I couldn't reference my experience with one). It was at Roseville, today Monday July 27th at about 2:30pm. I feel bad for the crew, obviously they are treated poorly and are paid horribly and that's why they give horrible service and serve up yesterday's food. I would not return to this location for wrinkly, brown, cold fries. Anywhere else is better.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

On the app after I finished choosing what I was going to order, the app said there was something I got that they didn't have anymore. So I called Del Taco to see what that was. The girl was rude and said she couldn't help me. She even got rough when me when I was trying to explain my predicament. Then I just ordered the food anyway, and when I received it. (Which took forever) Everything was cold, and soggy and gross. I called Del Taco, and they said I had to make a complaint through Uber Eats because they were help responsible for the meal if you order through them.

Today I went to Del Taco after looking online and seeing that they were supposed to be open for Dine in, unfortunately all of the doors were locked. I figured it must be open because there was a child inside running around with food in his hand. When I called the restaurant the rude associate informed me that it was drive thru only. I’m sure that should be advertised< /Text>

<Text>They're offering new menu item enchiladas, they were out. Ordered a Del burger, no bun, extra lettuce instead. It was a 1 to 10 pound Patty, overcooked. Very dry to say the least.

Been going here about once a month for years for fish tacos. This time was very disappointing. Ordered 5 for take out. Got home (about 5 minutes) tacos were cold and had very little taste. Will give them one more try...< /Review>

<text>In the drivethru tonight I  pay and the girl asks me to pull around and wait in a parking spot. There's no  car behind me in line. I say, how about I move if someone comes behind me. She says no. I say how long is it going to be? She says less then a minute. I go and park. No other car pulls into the drivethru. Less than a minute later she's walking out to my car with the tacos. I look into bag. No napkins. She's gone. I get out of my car, walk around to the entrance, go inside and wait two minutes for someone to give me a couple of napkins.

Good healthy food. Now they serve beyond meat. Everything is fresh and clean tasting.
Good prices and offers senior discount. A real value. Good for vegitarians.< /review>

<text>Good American style mexican food. Decent price and quick service. A lot better tasting fresh food then other similar fast food places.

Rarely have any problems with moding orders to taste. The grilled chicken soft tacos and burrito are way better without the white sauce. They have good marinated grilled chicken, the white sauce kills that flavor, best to exclude the sauce or replace with the red sauce.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< name>

Food is prepared well, offering a good quality at great prices. Staff is very, very casual, both making you feel at home but also potentially comprising professionalism. Still, visiting is like coming to the staff's home for dinner and it's thoroughly unpretentious and welcoming.< /review>

<Review>Still one of the strangest fast food concepts out there. It's like that mom and pop burger stand every city has where they make a little of everything but del taco just doesn't do it as well as the mom and pop joint. I've never been to a fast food restaurant and seen multiple people walk in and walk right back out (they were not busy btw) cashier was awkward but maybe just an off day. I will say the place was spotless though<//Review>< name>

I think Del Taco stacks up french fries (soggy) to keep the line going or (uncooked) too speedy. Give your people time to deliver perfectly crisp fries...Its the only negative.</text>

The food was just what i ordered and it was fresh. The staff can use a refresher course on how to work with the public. Person was barely speaking to me even when i asked a question.<//text>

Taco Tuesday Rocks!  But it could be cleaner inside.  Employees are very nice, but a little grungy.  Location invites some of the local transient population which can make for an interesting meal out with the family.   Just wish they had more locations! !< /review>

<Review>Ordered on the app, it was not supposed to be made until I arrived. Order was already there when I arrived and shakes were wrong. Female at window didn't believe when I told her it was wrong. I had to show her the order on my app before getting them remade. chili fries  had made the box and bag soggy,  collapsed when trying to remove.</Review>< Pics>

Place was clean and staff was nice but Its a bit ridiculous to add .50 cents per taco for a triple taco order. Not a single taco on the menu came with lettuce cheese tomatoes and sour cream..which is like a standard taco. The grilled chicken in my taco wasn't the greatest. I wouldn't come here again.< /text>

Good food at reasonable prices. Even though there is always a long line of cars at lunch time for the drive-through that goes down the street, it actually moves quickly. It is worth the wait.< /Review>

It wasn't very good this time I set in drive-through for 10 minutes at the window. The person work in the window it was their time to get off and they just left me sitting there in a lot of traffic behind me. Other than that it would have been good</text>

Pretty weak. I had a value taco which broke in half immediately, a chicken taco with far too little chicken and far too much sour cream, multiple tacos had wildly scattered ingredients, such as all the cheese clustered on one side. The impossible taco with the avocado was decent but not worth the original price. This is only worth a shot if you have some coupons.< /review>

A very good place for some Mexican fast food. Very customer friendly. Food is good and delicious. I love their combination burritos, tacos and churros. I like all their food. Place is clean and tidy. Service is very good. Best Del Taco in the area.< /Text>

<text>The best del taco in the busiest of places. Always fast food that is fresh and that is the del taco way and they do it well. They have long term employees that care. I love the cali steak and quac, any nachos, obviously chicken soft tacos on thursdays cuz theyre cheap and delicious. If you are broke, the $1 grillers are great too. Small dining area but most grab and go here so plenty of room to sit and eat. Breakfast wise grab an epic burrito.... cheap and filling and bomb!< /text><UserId.>105848126749973013958</UserId.>< pictures>

I don't know what has occurred here but this location has gone from great to horrible in the past two months. Dirty store, extremely slow service, and cold food. I just waited 45 minutes in the drive thru... There was only 5 cars in it and nobody inside. Employees seemed to be just be sitting around. None of the orders were large.</Review>

<text>Tried their Beyond burrito and the 'meat' is as runny as weinerszitel 'chili'. I've had Beyond Meat/Beef products and Del Taco corrupted it or are watering it down. Changed it from a 3 to a 2. I was here recently and the lights are out on the outside, the menu isn't well lit and today I pull up and their "system is down" for unforeseen time. 10min? My death? And the lights are still out and menu still unlit. Sub par.</text>< pics>

<review>2nd time in 20 years, barely anything has changed

I didn't like it then and it appears to have not improved.  Order was wrong, several items.  Food was edible but not tasty.  Ordered the 8 layer burrito with Beyond Meat, got a Beef and Cheese Burrito.

It seems like a popular location, maybe the other customers don't mind multiple mistakes, and just like the food.

Recommendation: Stop the complicated naming. Stick to Burrito, Taco, Quesadilla, etc...< /review>< pics>

<Text>Went to Del Taco after we were rudely turned away at Baja Fresh. (Woman decided not to serve a 12 year old girl 20 minutes before closing bc she was too lazy) Food was good. Window guy was...overly "happy" I think to cover up his irritation with being at work. I get it. Work sucks. Best thing tho...they got my order of 12 different items RIGHT. So big kudos for that.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x809b201e17a18231:0x629fb84a4f155f02</gmap_id></record>

I'm not enamored of fast food places in general, but I do like this Del Taco. Their food is fresh, made with minimal processing, and served with a smile. I am almost always greeted with willingness to accommodate special requests - with a smile. The pricing is reasonable, and their salads are usually pretty good.< /text>

I love their beans and that they offer fresh avocado. But they raised their price on the slices of 🥑. So i gave 4 stars only. But great value.</review>

Every Del Taco that I have been too all the way from Elk Grove to Marconi & Greenback, and the other way to mace Blvd has great customer service skills and the best part is the food tastes the exact same which is funny!!! Some fast food places you go to different ones but the same fast food name, and it Lwa uh s tastes different. In this case, every Del Taco I got to is on point with the food tasting exactly on point. This Del Taco however was very clean, quick with taking people's orders, and quick t ok get your food. This is an awesome place to eat if your looking for something quick and easy, Del Taco is the spot!!!<//review>

I like Del Taco in general, but it is frustrating when quality differs between locations. Thankfully I can report, this location definitely did not disappoint.  The place was clean, the worker was very friendly (and since it was late and thus not crowded, even brought our orders over to the table), and most importantly the food was PERFECT.  Now how often can you say that when going to a fast food restaurant?!

Unfortunately for us this location is about a half hour even when the traffic is good.  But nonetheless, I have to say our first visit was excellent.  And whenever we find ourselves in the Roseville area again, we'll be sure to make it the first of many!</Text>

First day waited 20 min in line at the Drive thru. ordered2 of The Del Tacos. shells cracked and hardly any cheese at all. paid 1.50 each. mgr said come back& they would replace my meal. I return today and the Tacos were cracked even more and the kid at the window was throwing ghings around and being very cocky& rude.

Food is usually made with care here. Occasionally a limp salad. Their food looks and tastes fresher than at their competitor. Lets be honest, this isn't really Mexican food, but for what it is - drive thru, healthier choices available, reasonably priced menu - is good.< /Text>

<Text>Friendly workers, good food, and rarely mess up on the orders (but be sure to check your bags before you leave, just in case). ;) The only downfall for me is that they don't have a lot of "Pescatarian (a person who does not eat meat, but does eat fish)" options...the fish tacos. That's my go-to. haha Anyway, it's good!<//Text>< Pics>

<review>It was chicken taco night and it took 35 min. To get 2 tacos and a burrito and the manager was apologizing to everybody and offering people free coke or fries or whatever but when he got to me he called my number and walked away without any apology. So I will never go there again.</review>< username>

There lucky to get 1 star from me. I drove down the street to Carl's Jrs, after seeing this place had an outside bathroom with a payment for coins to use it??? What kind of place is this, that charges you to use the restroom?? All I wanted was to wash my hands before I ate there.<//Review>

Slowest drive thru in Roseville. They often forget to ask me If I need sauce and the food has come out cold on numerous ocassions. I like my quesadillas to be hot and fresh. Don't think I'll be stopping at this location anytime soon until they speed up the drive thru time, I can't wait 20 minutes for 3 quesadillas.< /review>

I visited several months ago and had several health code concerns that I contacted corporate about. Last week I went 1/2 hour out my way just to go there. Although one of my concerns looked as if it was addressed (bathroom had cigarette butts on the floor, torn up brilo pads, bloody napkins). The others looked the same (food prep area counter's and floors look like they haven't been cleaned in days, homeless people napping at outside table and pacing up & down sidewalk next to windows).  I will never eat there again and have told friends and family to stay away from that location</review>

Food itself was eadible and we didn't get sick from it, so I suppose that's good. However, it was very greasy (moreso than other taquerias), bland and lacked complexity in it's flavor. Better than other fast food taco chains, but still a fast food taco chain, so don't expect much. It was the only place around to grab something quick out our way to Tahoe and went in with low expectations (the place being a fast food chain and all), so we weren't disappointed. You get what you pay for... "Authentic" Mexican food it isn't, but it's fast, cheap and clean. Oh, no public restroom there.<//text>

I have no idea why some people have an issue with Del Taco. First it's not mexican food, so don't judge it as such. With that said, it's darn tasty.<//Text>

<Review>Say no onions -  they put extra, ordered 12 mini quesadillas - they gave us 11, asked for green sauce - they said ok and gave us none. Above all that the drive-thru person's attitude was not very customer friendly. Highly disappointed and cheated</Review>< user_id>

<Text>Went to this Del Taco at 11:45pm. The speaker played the "please come back when we're open" message. They're supposed to be open until midnight.  Of the 3 cars in front of me, only the front 2 had orders. And another car pulled in behind me! So its not like they were completely dead & closed early. I wont go back to this location.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

This place is ridiculous I came here on a Sunday night at 11 p.m. to pick up a doordash order and they ran out of chicken and steak and majority of the list of order that I had to get was Chicken in there and it's insane how they ran out of chicken and steak too!! 👎👎<//text>
