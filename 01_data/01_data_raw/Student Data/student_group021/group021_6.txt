< Review>
I’ve been coming to Curry House since I was a kid. The traditional Japanese curry is truly a comfort food for the soul.

I’ve never had anything bad here. My favorite is the seafood curry. I also enjoy the chicken katsu curry at the super spicy level.

The pasta dishes are also delightful here. The tofu salad and the shrimp salads are incredibly satisfying. Portions are very American.< /Review>

Once you enter, wait staff will seat you.

When ordering curry, you can adjust the spiciness to your liking.

The menu is mostly curry, rice, and pasta. Warm comfort food and very delicious!</Review>

I don't love curry style ramen but this was still really good! Don't have much to compare it too and I usually like it spicy but it was good and a fair price for lunch. Also quick and friendly staff.<//review>

If like me, you love the traditional beef curry, then thus is the place for you. I ate so much curry in Japan and I was very happy to see one on my visit to LA.<//review>

Standard for Japanese curry.  Good spot for a quick lunch or dinner.  Family friendly menu.  Kids meals are nicely presented and come with a toy.  My niece and nephew enjoyed it.< /text>

<review>We’ve been going to The Curry House for more than 30 years. Incredibly good food for a reasonable price considering the quality. We went to this location for lunch on ThAnksgiving day. When the food arrive it was not piping hot.  We ordered brown rice (theirs is really good) but apparently it was either old or overcooked. There were bits so hard that I thought some little pieces of bone were left on my chicken meat (chicken curry) but the my partner’s seafood curry had those crunchy bits.   The curry sauce was tasty but was “faded” from the rich brown we’re used to seeing.  I sure hope this was a one off because we’ve loved their food for years.</review>< Rating>

One of the best curry joints around. There is a good variety of food available here and prompt service. You can choose the level of spice that they make your food which is nice since curry isn't curry to me without some heat. You also have a good variety of proteins from seafood, beef, chicken, and pork. They also have a good kids menu if you're bringing long the kiddos. Parking is available for free in the shopping area . I prefer this location to the one in little Tokyo.</Text>

So yummy as always!
I had the Sesame Chicken Curry on rice pilaf.  I had had a big lunch so I only ate half but it was so very tasty and the left overs reheated at home were equally as good. Curry House never disappoints! Try the Curry Udon also. You will be happy you did.< /Review>

<Text>I couldn't tell the difference between my "spicy" curry and my wife's mild curry. The salad tasted like it came out of a Smart and Final premade salad bag. I'm hard to disappoint but this food was just bla. The service was great. I really liked the server. But the food?. Meh... I won't be going back.

I know this place has been around for a while. I remember them being good back in the day. But I also don't remember many other places offering curry back when this place opened. I think they need to revamp their recipes and image.

I wish them well. Gordon Ramsey need to give them a makeover.< /Text><Name>Michael V< /Name>< Rate>

My husband and I have been coming here for over a decade.  Needless to say we love this place.  His go to dish is Katsu Curry over rice.....delicious!  I love the seafood curry over spaghetti.  The service has always been great. The dishes are always served in a timely manner and the drinks refilled several times.< /Review>

Had red beans, uncooked snap peas, lettuce, corn, and some kind of dressing that wasnt good. Ordered the katsu curry(med). It was ok, veggies were not offered at all. Son ordered meatball spaghetti.  He said it tasted funny to him but the bread was good. Overall my daughter loved it. I won't go back unless my daughter wants it.

It's average.  Food is good but portions are a bit small for the price. Usually a wait in the weekends. Worth trying but won't be in my regular rotation.< /text>

<Text>Just came to this particular location because the one I usually go to is closed. I got here and waited for them to ask how many in my party, but they ignored me and tended to other people who basically cut ahead of me in line. I'm already unsatisfied with this location. Thanks, Torrance...</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<review>I love getting their chicken leg katsu curry. Nothing beats the classic taste of curry too. I really love adding their fukujinzuku (or pickled vegetables) to the curry. I highly recommend it. The meals are not so cheap though.<//review></record>

<Rate>4</Rate><text>Curry House is an institution.  Their curry rivals some of the best I've ever had.  They even sell their curry in packets for you to make at home (although somehow cooking it yourself is not quite the same).  The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars, as opposed to 5, is because I prefer the spice customization offered at Coco Ichibanaya just across town in Torrance.</text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Menchi or chicken leg katsu for me. Make it hot spicy adding few more hot oil and you'll be getting curry sweats in a gluttonous treat🤗🤗
**Potage corn soup and fried shrimps***

Curry House is a respectable chain restaurant so I have no idea how they could let this place fall apart so terribly. The booths need to be replaced and the carpet needs to be torn up. I don't even know if the food is good or not because I was rushing to get out of there. Such a shame.< /text><user>116144656868925735092< /user></record>

Get the Curry Udon! you won't regret it. I'm not a fan of Japanese Curry. I'm not a fan of Udon. I absolutely ama fan of Curry House Curry Udon. Just Do It! My friends went with me and decided not to trust my advice, then I let them try it. The next time we went, all five of us ordered curry Udon. Nuf said.</Text>

It's sad, but I need to revise my original 5 star rating to 3. The service and food is not what it once was. I'm not sure what happened, but both are now poor.</review>

This public storage has a lot of capacity and the people were friendly. The little rooms were clean and neat. I felt that my storage area was in a safe place and the entrances were surveilled with a video camera.</Text>

Michelle provided outstanding assistance and was extremely polite and professional!  She is the reason I went ahead and bought all of my moving supplies at once! The store is stocked with all the moving and packing supplies needed to move a whole house!  IF your GPS messes up and takes you here instead of the competitor, you'll be as lucky as I am because this Public Storage location is ONE STOP SHOPPING!< /review>

<pics>None<//pics><review>I've had a unit at Public Storage for a long time, and finally managed to consolidate my things into a smaller unit.  Michelle, at the San Ramon location, was super helpful, introducing me to a transferring unit option that allowed me to pro rate the monthly charges between the two units.  She was also just a super all around nice and helpful person.  Thanks Public, it really makes a difference to customer satisfaction when you hire great people like Michelle!<//review>< username>

When I was moving, I was helped by Bruce who brought me a dolly right away. This is a pretty quiet location.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Great customer service! We rented a space to add packed boxes for our move and they went out of their way to find the right space, even looking to other locations. Then we needed boxes and such and Michelle was more than helpful! I went back to get more and she was out of the office so I waited in my car since it was only going to be 5 minutes, and she came out and called to me when she returned. We weren't sure if tiny bubble wrap was best for our vases or if the bigger size, and as soon as I mentioned the word "vases" she pointed to the bigger size. I'd highly recommend Public Storage!<//text></record></dataset><record>

Worked out great for me - got a small space that fits my needs to a tee, and at a great price. Janine wss great, walked me through all my options carefully and thoroughly and we shared a couple of laughs as I fumbled through my keyboard. Certainly high on my list of places to recommend to others.< /text>

<Review>Michelle is great!  She was very helpful, patient and not pushy.  When we returned to rent the unit, she was very clear in explaining the rules, etc., and didn’t rush through everything.  She helped with the cart to move our things into the unit. Very professional.</Review>< response>

I was looking for a good place to store my belongings because I am moving. I called this public storage and spoke with a young lady named Jordan. She was so helpful and very sweet and professional over the phone. I had many questions and she was able to answer them all. I will definitely be using public storage to store all my things.< /text>

I walked into public storage a tad stressed. Moving out of state has been overwhelming! When I got here I was greeted by both Michelle and Lynn. They helped me with all the packing supplies I needed with a great discount. I am very appreciative for all  your help ladies you deserve more than a  review< /text>

Excellent service at this Public Storage location. The staff has always been helpful and responsive to requests. The unit was clean when we moved in and the rest of the facility also appears well maintained.When we no longer needed the space, move out was very smooth and easy. I highly recommend them and would use them again if we have the need for a storage unit in the future.< /Review>

Excellent customer service! Michelle found the perfect unit for us making it as convenient as possible, offered us tips on how to protect our belongings. Especially my daughters fur vanity seats. Even with people coming in asking for help she managed all of us single handily with exceptional service. Thanks Public Storage for having friendly smiley faces around< /Review>

<Review>Marc is an awesome guy. The level of service he provided was beyond excellent. This is my first time experience with a storage and I did not know what to expect, a lot of question to be asked but Marc was very patience answering all the questions and he was very detail oriented as well.

The place is very clean too. It is well maintained. Located in a nice area and neighborhood.< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
I am very impressed with Michelle as a person and as a Manager! I was late on the payment of two units due to the illness and passing of a family cat.  I explained the situation and offered documentation.  She is working on putting through an adjustment request.  Whether it occurs or not she was very kind and empathetic and I greatly appreciate her listening and helping me🙏🌈😉</Review>

I ordered the space online and within 10 min Shelia reached out to me to make an appointment.  After going into the location the both helped me with finalizing the contract and getting me the keys to the space within minutes.  They both were very helpful and seemed interested in making sure i had what was needed for the space.

Thanks again and i will recommend this location to my friends.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Text>I have been a customer for over 3 years.  They have been great since the day that I first called them to ask about what space they had available.   They are helpful, courteous, efficient, knowledgeable, friendly, fun.    I have worked with Sheila several times over the years and it is always a delight.   Today, Marc helped me out and he was fantastic too.   I have an issue and it was fixed in 10 minutes with a smile, some good conversation and some suggestions.

I liked this facility so much that I had two other family members take storage units.   They loved it too. No hassles moving in.  The paperwork was easy.  The facility is always clean and dry.   The team is there for you no matter what you  need.

They are great.   I am so lucky to have found space here.

Just finished my 2nd stint here and it was always easy to work with the staff and the property is well maintained and secure. Hopefully won't need a unit again, but if so I would not hesitate to use Public Storage in San Ramon.< /review>

Meow this public storage is the finest institution of square and rectangular empty spaces I've ever had the privilege of visiting. I'd say "rats," meow, if they weren't purveyors of high quality cardboard boxes n such, but they are! So absolutely no rats to report, meow. Well done to the cats running the PS office!! Meow keep up the good work and you won't have rats reviews.< /Review>

<Review>Went into this storage facility a couple weeks ago just to get a few boxes. Michael was working at the counter and was very helpful. I got a bunch of great ideas on what i would need to move as easily as possible. He then asked for a review so here it is, better late than never.

We have had a storage unit at this facility for many years and have been very pleased with everything. From the cleanliness of the buildings and surrounding area, to the ease with which to access our things, to speaking with personnel on site, everything has been wonderful. In particular, at our latest visit, Chrisann was working at the office and she was VERY helpful with supplying us with whatever we needed. That kind of customer service is hard to find nowadays. Keep up the good work!< /text>

There was a break in of my unit and others and the lady the is normally at the front desk not only didn't return my calls but didn't show up the next day. Another person was called into help out, Dawn, and she was more that helpful. I had to leave town and didn't feel that my property would be secure she made sure that it would be. Thank you Dawn, you more than made up for the disappointment I felt the night before when I noticed the break in. Thank you.< /review>

I stopped by very rushed where Halie was quick to assist.  I immediately rented a unit then recommended my company rent one as well. Needless to say - we were both greeted with professional immediate assistance and settled into 2 Units in August. Thank you :)</review>

I had the greatest experience today. The guy that helped me was so nice and funny. I was having a really bad day and I had to leave another storage place because the lady was so rude. He was actually refreshing. Michael helped me find what I needed and answered all my questions. I would definitely recommend this place.<//Review>

Michelle was very professional and so helpful with choosing the best storage for our family.

We were incorrectly bullied there and overpaid. I was given the wrong amount and put into a lien sale prior to legal time allowed. Such a stressful situation. It was continuous bullying ina very stressful time in my life. So happy to be done with this facility.< /Text>

I have needed the services of public storage on several occasions over the past couple of years.  Public Storage in San Ramon always jumped to the top on service and price and I was always treated professionally in my dealings there.  Chrisana in particular was very helpful, always in good spirits and extremely customer service oriented.  Next time I need storage I won't even shop around, I'll just go there.<//text>

< Review>
I have been trying to write a review for this property for about a month and I find your site for this is not friendly. I want to tell you about  the manager Sheila Smith is a very friendly lady and very helpful in setting up the right size of storage unit. I explained to her what my problem was moving from Hayward Ca. to Danville Ca. She returned  my calls and was very helpful and I did move into the property, because of her being so interested in my move to the public storage. Thanks Sheila Smith... I wish there was more people like her, who listen and have all the Right answers. Way To Go Sheila......   Sandra Smith<//Review>

<userid>116363268450744720521< /userid><text>I write this review with such gratitude for the professional, kind, knowledgeable and supportive assist from Chris and Sheila at our Public Storage! From our initial phone contact with Sheila we were able to change our smaller online reservation unit to a larger one seamlessly and pleasantly!

In addition, a kind, appreciative thanks goes out to another stellar staff member Chris after we found out that our moving truck broke down on the Public Storage property after unloading! In spite of this unexpected breakdown Chris was very understanding and gracious in allowing us to leave the moving truck on the premises until we were able to get a towing truck to move it elsewhere! No hassle...just support!!

Our unit and the facility is very clean, well lit and clearly secure! The office hours are generous and its onsite location makes it easy to stop by and ask questions if needed!

In summary, I rate this facility and its staff an easy 5 stars!

Most sincerely,

<text>EDITED FOUR TIMES & AGAIN !!

THIS PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY, SINCE THEIR PAST MANAGER, A SHEILA SMITH + her relative A COP & WORLDWIDE CRIME GANGS, (I have been told, by public storage district manager, of contra costa county, california USA Public Storage, that I am not allowed to question any public storage employee about their past employee, sheila smith, and if I do not like public storage I need to move my storage out of public storage. Public Storage has lots of info on me...and this district manager will not tell me her last name &/or family name) WHO ALSO WAS AT PUBLIC STORAGE FACULTY IN PLEASANTON, CA USA, SLEEZY CASTRO VALLEY, CA USA, RENO, NEVADA USA, LAS VEGAS, NEVADA USA, SAN RAMON, CALIFORNIA USA, OAKLAND, CA USA ETC ETC HAS WILLFULLY, WITH MALICE, BEEN AMONG THE MANY GUILTY OF AGGREVATING STALKING, HACKING, STEALING ETC ID'S I REPRESENT (SEE MY TWITTER @IAMONLYCAFFREY) & MY INHERTANCES (I HAVE RECOVERED NONE OF MY INHERTANCES YET).

YES, I'M PREJUDICE, SO DEAL WITH IT CRIMINALS! ALL ARE ILLEGAL FOR WILLFULLY, WITH MALICE & WITH THEIR GREED, MALYSIOUSLY DESIMATING ID'S I REPRESENT (SEE MY TWITTER @IAMONLYCAFFREY) NATIONALITIES, ANCESTRIES, & RELIGION.

I HAVE HAD ONE "SMITH" OR ANOTHER "SMITH" AGGREVATING STALKING, HACKING, STEALING ETC  ID'S I REPRESENT (SEE MY @IAMONLYCAFFREY) & MY INHERTANCES ETC SINCE BEFORE 1979 (ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY BOARDWALK REGENCY HOTEL & CASINO>ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY CEASAR'S HOTEL & CASINO)>LAS VEGAS, NEVADA HILTON > MGM ETC ETC

THIS PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY, LIKE ALL PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITIES, GUARENTEES THAT THEIR UNPACKAGED LOCK WITH KEYS-THESE  2EXPENSIVE LOCKS WITH KEYS ARE SOLD TO CUSTOMERS FOR STORAGE RENTAL UNITS-ONLY PURCHASER, OF UNPACKAGED LOCK, HAS KEYS, NO ONE ELSE. SHEILA SMITH HAS MOVED ON, I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO LOCATE HER.
THE DESK CLERK, NOW AT THIS PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY, HAS ALSO GUARENTEED THE TWO UNPACKAGED LOCKS I HAD TO PURCHASE ((THEIR MIKE REMOVED A LOCK, I BOUGHT ELSEWHERE, I HAD ON STORAGE UNIT I RENT & SUPPOSEDLY THIS MIKE WAS FIRED (and a Barry &  Jim were fired, at Public Storage, 1400 E Tropicana, LV NV 89119-both of these scums sold me unpackaged, unboxed storage unit lick & key-for thefts they did to Public Storage Company) BUT REPLACED WITH ANOTHER MIKE)) BUT I TRUST NONE AT ANY NATIONWIDE & CANADA ETC PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITIES.
I RECENTLY WENT TO MY STORAGE FACILITY, AND BOTH LOCKS & KEYS (I PURCHASED BOTH LOCKS FROM SAME PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY) DID NOT OPEN NEITHER LOCKS. DISTRICT MANAGER, A VERNA, DOES NOT MAKE APPOINTMENTS TO CUT OFF LOCKS ON STORAGE FACILITY(ONLY A PUBLIC STORAGE DISTRICT MANAGER CAN CUT OFF PUBLIC STORAGE RENTAL UNIT LOCK),THE LOCKS WERE CUT OFF WITHOUT ME BEING PRESENT. ☆NO PUBLIC STORAGE OWNER, EMPLOYEE, INVESTOR CAN HAVE A COPY OF MY UNIT LOCK KEY...PER RENTAL AGREEMENT!☆ I AM UNABLE TO FILE A COMPLAINT &/OR INSURANCE CLAIM UNTIL I TRAVEL BACK TO CALIFORNIA, FROM LAS VEGAS, NEVADA....I MUST DO THESE CHORES IN PERSON !!

☆☆☆MY TWEETS, POSTS, GOOGLE+ ETC, ON ALL MY ACCOUNTS, ARE ONLY MINE TO USE AS EXAMPLE, A COMLAINT ETC. I STAND ALONE ALWAYS.☆☆☆

I'M NEVER INTERESTED IN ANY CLASS ACTION SUIT (I NEVER COLLECTED ANY MONIES IN THE CLASS ACTION SUIT, AGAINST PUBLIC STORAGE, AROUND 2011) &/OR ANOTHER/OTHERS JOINING ME IN LEGAL ACTIONS AGAINST PUBLIC STORAGE. MY COMPLAINTS ARE ONLY MINE TO HANDLE.
I REALIZE NOW, MY ID & ETC WAS STOLEN BY AGGREVATED STALKERS, HACKERS THIEVES & SLUMLORDS (INCLUDES SLUMLORDS, THEIR EMPLOYEES, OTHER APT RENTERS & THEIR GUESTS & PALS & COPS ETC) ETC WHEN I RENTED PUBLIC STORAGE UNITS AT PUBLIC STORAGE, BOULDER HWY, LV NV USA, IN 2003, AND BY PUBLIC STORAGE, NEWARK, CALIFORNIA USA, IN 2008.

I CAN ONLY HOPE SOMEHOW I CAN FORCE PUBLIC STORAGE TO STOP SELLING UNBOXED LOCKS & KEYS, & LOCKS & KEYS THEY BUY, IN BULK WITHOUT PACKAGING OR IN A BOX. PUBLIC STORAGE EMPLOYEES ARE AGGRESIVE (HARD SELL) SELLING THEIR LOCKS&KEYS TO CUSTOMERS (LOCKS COST ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH COMPARED TO STORES) TELLING CUSTOMER THAT ONLY PUBLIC STORAGE LOCKS & KEYS ARE ACCEPTABLE FOR THEIR STORAGE UNITS.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<text>This is the best iPhone repair shop in Hollywood! Brought them my iPhone X and my wife's XR for different issues, and they took care of it. Rates are reasonable, and the service is really top notch! Hooked us up with screen protectors too. Stopped by early morning, had the phones back by the afternoon.<//text><Rating>5< /Rating><pictures>None< /pictures>< Gmap_id>

Very fast repair! And really great customer service, they answered some of my questions at like 12 am. Reasonably priced if you want a really fast repair in a few hours!< /review>

Exceptional value, speedy service, and very high quality. I've been here twice (unfortunately) for cracked screens. My phone screen came out sparkling each time.I've researched and prices elsewhere tend to be much higher. All you need is this shop! It's worth it.</review>

Khan was so helpful!! He fixed my iPhone X screen super quickly and saved the day. Prices are very reasonable, I got quoted by a bunch of repairs shops in the area and his was the cheapest. -and comes with a 1 year warranty!! Highly recommend</review>

<Review>Had a iPhone 7 cracked screen. Before could get worse took in to get the screen replaced. Staff are knowledgeable, young and know latest technology. 55 dollars for refurbished and 85 dollars for Apple screen. And great covers for 10-12 dollars. In an hour your phone is fixed and just like new!! Payment and receipt are transacted through square up.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>My fiance's cracked the back of her iPhone XS Max and we got it repaired quickly in a few hours here. It looks as good as new! It was $99 and we also bought a front screen protector for $10. Hopefully we won't need another phone fixed but if we do, we'll come back here for the repairs.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2bfbd46672f2f:0x8ea7f307bec5732f<//Gmap_id></record>

These guys are awesome. I dropped my iPhone (more than once) , it was completely demolished. I called 2 stores in my area before calling these guys. Within an hour of calling , I walked out of Sunset Wireless with my phone completely repaired , looked brand new (I live in Hollywood.) Honestly, I was a little hesitant with the price , as it was almost half the cost of the previous 2 quotes. Ended up being a perfect fix , and without burning a hole in my pocket. I guess there is still some honest & fair shops out there. They definitely gained my business for life. My only suggestion is to call with a heads up for a repair , as it seems they get pretty busy, even with 3 employees there.<//Text>

I've had my phone extremely cracked (glass chipping and falling) and came to Imtiaz based of reviews from yelp and my friends suggesting this place as well, AND LET ME TELL YOU HE WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU AND YOUR PHONE! I got my screen replaced once by him (I purchased the original ~$90 iPhone screen) and yes it did have some glitches but when I notified him about the problem he was super kind and said he'll replace the screen SINCE YOU DO HAVE A 1-YEAR WARRANTY for problems such as mine. He's super efficient with how fast he works and knowledgeable about the in's and outs of the phone he's working on. My new replacement screen definitely works like new with no hassle either. Thank you Imtiaz you are greatly appreciated< /Text>

<text>Fast, friendly and professional.. The best service ever!
I visited this shop on Sat at 4 pm today, and it took only 10 mins for him to repair my iPhone 6 screen (including the protection glass). Oh yea, and he also gave me & attached a protection glass for free!
This place is definitely a 4 star and strongly recommend to everyone.<//text>< pictures>

My iPhone 6 Plus touch didn't work after I went to a repair shoe for the screen. The original apple sceeen worked good but the touch diseases on he iPhone 6 Plus was bad with flashing grey on the top. They fixed it in about 1 hour for the motherboard repair. Also my back camera didn't focus. New camera and pictures are like new! All in 2 hours on Sunday Memorial Day weekend !! All repairs same day😊</review>

Tech came out to my office and fixed my destroyed iPhone in about 15 minutes. He was prompt to our appointment and even called me saying he would be a little early. Price was fair as he comes to you. In a way, I hope I never have to call him again - but if my phone decides to do acrobatics again, I'll be hitting this dude up.< /text>

There is a reason why this business is solid 5 stars here. First of all they are the cheapest in the city. Second- they usually will repair ur phone on the same day you drop off. Third- they never try to rip you off. For example they honestly told my friend that replacing screen for iphone x is cheaper at the apple store.</Text>

I was looking for low prices on a t-mobile smartphone. I wanted to spend  $60. I was able to buy an unlocked Samsung galaxy for the low price I wanted. Will buy used or new cell phones here<//Review>

My iPad air 2 had dropped and the glass cracked very badly. The apple store wanted an extreme amount of money. I wanted the cheapest repair shop with the BEST quality apple parts and service. I was able to have my iPad repaired the same day! super excited about the repair price and speed. My tmobile cell phone payment was due and conveniently this place was able to process my tmobile payment. Great place, will refer all of my friends in los angeles<//text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>I have fixed many broken iPhone, iPad, MacBook computer, and other cell phones. We have a family of 11!! We have always brought 3-5 broken phones and iPad at the same time. They give us wholesale discounts and fast repair service every time. I own a printing service that we have even traded our services for repair. We went from our old iPhone 5 and 5s to iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus now (hopefully it will not break the screen anytime soon)< /review><user>107610498606300056949< /user><Rate>5<//Rate><username>Jeremiah Santos</username>< date>

My girlfriend had dropped the iphone 6 in a pool of water! We were desperate need for the iPhone to work properly and hopefully recover any information possible. Within 1 hour the phone was on completely, refurbished as if it was new. Unreal! I will send all of my friends to Daniel and Chris at 6363 Hollywood for all iphone, ipad, and computer repair. It is tucked behind clothing store right on hollywood blvd.< /review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>This is a pretty terrible place. None of the electronic switches/latches worked properly. When certain puzzles were solved and it seemed like a door/latch should have opened, it didn’t. After asking for a clue they told us to do exactly what we did before and all of the sudden it opened. It was apparent that the puzzles were manually operated by the staff and they weren’t attentive enough to know when the puzzles were solved correctly the first time. There was one clue where they told us to flip a switch a certain way to “fix” it. We told them we changed it (but we didn’t actually change anything) and then we heard a relay click which opened a door. When we notified the staff that some of the electronics didn’t work, they starred at us without saying a word. I will not be going back and will not recommend this place to anyone< /Review>< user_name>

We had my son's birthday party at the Bakersfield location. The kiddos were stoked for the Nerf Gun War. However, it was not what we expected. First off, the room was tiny. Like maybe 30' x 15'. We had 9 kids ages 4-10. I can't imagine trying to squeeze in older kids or worse yet 10 adults! Secondly, the Nerf Guns kept getting jammed. My husband and another parent spent the entire time fixing the jammed guns. At one point, all guns had jammed and the kiddos just resorted to throwing the Nerf bullets at each other.
The staff were very friendly. They explained everything thoroughly, but after about 5 minutes into the Nerf Gun War the employee left and we didn't see him again until our time was up and we headed back to the lobby.
I've heard great things about the escape rooms here, but we won't be returning for the Nerf Gun War. :(< /Review>

Amazing! We did the pirates escape room and the guy that explained everything even dressed up with a pirate hat. We were close to finishing so he extended our time a little so we could finish it! It was so nice and everything was explained super well. I also loved the little intro video and the extra details it really added to the experience!< /text>

Was fun the first time i went! However, just recently i took my oldest daughter and her friend, and feel it was a complete waste of money. The targets and cages were worn down or broken. Most of the throwing equipment was missing. And what they did have.... was extremely dull.<//Text>

This was my first experience doing an escape room and it was fantastic! I was smiling throughout the experience a good amount of the time. Did the pirate room with 7 others for my bachelor party. If you're curious, we succeeded! With such a positive experience, I am kinda hooked on escape rooms and want to do more in the future.<//Text>

<Review>I booked the Axe throwing with three teenagers and myself. We've been to several other axe throwing businesses on the East Coast and northern California that were amazing! In comparison, Brainy was horrible on so many levels.  It was highly unsafe! The blades were dull and some even had chips. Because of this, they were bouncing back past the throwing line. The handles were sharper on some than the blades! One of my boys cut his finger on a janky handle.

They allowed other customers to play some hardcore rap with derogatory language. Typically don't care about this, but another family with 7-8 year old children were also in there.... highly unprofessional and disrespectful!

They even shut the door going from the lobby to the axe throwing area, leaving all of the customers unattended without any employee.

Not to mention, the place just seemed unkept  and unattended to - trash all over from previous customers. No paper towels in the restroom, and Christmas decorations still up (It's March!)

Although my kids did have fun throwing axes, this place seems very unsafe and unprofessional compared to the two other places my family has experienced and that's what we were looking for here...Sad we didn't find that experience.</Review><response>None< /response>< time>

All the lights were off & we called the main number got in touch with someone & they explained that the person, Macie, would be there in 20 minutes. We waited over 30 minutes, almost an hour past our reservation & Macie FINALLY showed up as we had decided to go ahead & go to our dinner reservations. A very let down moment & the birthday kid’s day was ruined. Very upsetting.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

<Review>SO MUCH FUN!!!! I came for a date night and had an absolute blast throwing knives and axes. By the end of the hour we could actually aim and stick most of the axes it was fantastic, a great stress relief and just a little competitive, perfect for a date night! They have a bunch of other activities and I cannot wait to come back and try them all!! Ask for Dana she was an excellent host 😊😊</Review>< Pictures>

Really fun facility for a date night. I brought my date here for an escape room and it was a blast. We both had a great time and it showed us that we actually are compatible. Fun times<//Text>

Went through one of the three escape rooms at brainy actz and had an absolute blast! The room kept us entertained and guessing until the very end. Great experience and wonderful staff!! Dustin miller, the manager was extremely helpful and accommodating. Overall great experience. They also have axe throwing, nerf and archery wars, a paint splatter room as well as a rage room! Will absolutely be back to try out the other activities! 10/10</text>

I was not impressed. I was expecting the rage room to be full of things you can break but the front desk lady just set up a few things to smash and it was over in a few minutes. The room was not clean there was smashed items all the edge of the wall. For the price I was expecting a lot more. Maybe shelves set up of things you can break and throw, not just a few items set up on buckets you cannot smash.
Not worth the price.
If you want to rage go to the dollar store and buy $40 worth items and smash at your house.<//review>

< Review>
The West Covina Elks Lodge is conformable place to meet  with friends. It has a spacious lounge which accommodates fine dining and entertainment with karaoke and invited guest bands. The facility has large hall that provides room to host weddings and special events. I recommend a visit as a guest or inquiry into joining the order. Open every day from 5:00 o'clock and closed on Sundays.</Review>

<Text>My Review on The Elks lodge in West Covina is based on a single Member that took a advantage of my family and my self in a separate matter. Often times people forget that when they do things that are morally and ethically wrong they not only represent them self but all organizations they so proudly claim to be associated with. Mr Mario Ivan Arellano a member of the Elks Lodge of West Covina not only lied and breached Contract and his duty when being our realtor, now that we need him to make things right he is no where to found. Mr. Arellano braged about how much he helped the community as a member of the Elks Lodge as we would often meet with him after one of there events to sign paperwork and he was still in his  Elks Lodge shirt displaying the name of the name of the organization. All I ask is that the Elks Lodge of West Covina be more careful of there members as what they do aside from the Lodge also reflects on them especially when they are a organization that is to help the community not lie in order to make a quick buck and then disappear when things go wrong because of there own actions.</Text>< GmapID>

Attended the Super Bowl game and it was all down hill from there. The commercials were interrupted, people slipped and fell to where 911 needed to be called. Guests were rude and way too many were drunk. There was puke all over the restroom and the side of a car in the parking lot. The event was far too crowded.</text>

The enchilada sauce was pretty sour for my taste. The rice texture was good and flavorful. I did the half and half sauce but think I would've preferred just one sauce over the mix. The burrito size was huge. The menu prices are wrong that people posted. I paid a good 3 dollars more then what the pictures on here stated. The area is really dirty and shady. A few homeless people lingering around, as well as a people hanging around in the parking lot in front of the liquor store next door. Wouldn't suggest coming at night just from the looks alone.</Text>< Rating>

Fantastic food from the salsa chips to the main course meal. Very authentic Mexican food with a lot of favors. Very friendly staff and everything taste fresh. Truck parking is just across the street  as well, so it's a truck friendly location. Now I will say it's not in the best neighborhood around, so just watch your surroundings.
When it comes to the food....umm man-oh-man!!!
delicioso!!< /Review>

Super friendly!  We were impressed with the service.  I would recommend the Mexican food vs the standard breakfast items.  Thwir wet burrito was delicious.</text>

I go there all the time! I usually get the same thing . I get a burrito de carnitas con aguacate! And enjoy every single last bite. Would recommend this place to anyone. Staff is supper friendly too so that's a plus<//Text>

The owner is really nice and readily provides samples we will be back for more. They also have a table up front with an assortment of games.<//review>< Pics>

Shaved ice was great. Had the root beer float. Can't remember the name of what it was that added ice cream but it was worth it! Very good. Employees very nice.<//Review>

Good snowball place, tons of flavors and if they accidentally pack the ice too tight they will throw more syrup on it once you get to the center where it didnt reach, what more could ya want?</text>

I am from Arizona, where I regularly get treats from Bahama Buck's. I happened upon this location in HB on 11/5/17 after a trip to the grocery store. It was right before they closed, so if they didnt want to serve us, they should have said "sorry, we're closed" and I honestly wish they would have said that. The price was about a dollar more than AZ locations but we didn't care because we were excited to find that they even exist in CA. Well, as we're being rung up, the guy making our shaved ice yells to the cashier "IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE TO-GO!" We say Yes that's fine, cuz we were planning on that anyway. Well then he brings over our order, and throws it down without looking at us or saying anything. It's a complete rip-off disappointment; completely flat cup of smashed flat shaved ice with a flat soda lid on top and an umbrella in the straw hole. I come here for the cup of shaved ice that is ALWAYS a colorful MOUNTAIN that towers about 3 or 4 inches above the rim of the cup. This kid is needs to be fired, he ripped me off and completely killed my fascination with this place.< /text>

Growing up on raspaldos which is a mexican iceing desert. SO GLAD to find a place to bring back those childhood memories with even more options. After trying a variety of their flavors. I found one that reminds me of a orange creamsicle. Thank You for the Sweet memories.<//text>

The real bummer is that I had three $10.00 Groupon's that I wanted to use. The middle school jr. high group from Beachpoint Church which is about 25 kids headed over one night after church. The kids all got in line to order individually and since I had the Groupons I wanted to help out the kids that needs the financial help. Two kids ordered and the total was $9.02 and so I paid with the 1st Groupon (I did not get change because it was a Groupon) then three more kids ordered, the total was over $12.00 when I went to pay for them I was told I could not use another Groupon. Of course no manager was on duty and so I just paid out of pocket for the 3 kids that just ordered.  I was not happy.... I spent more than the Groupon Cost!!! Terrible costumer experience and that is why I am writing this review.<//text>< user_id>

<Review>This place is great I use to go to Joes and bro’s they are good barbers but now with a price of $35 for a cut that’s way to much , did some looking online found Guzman barber shop Pascual does a great job on fades and at $20 that’s more convenient for me he got himself a customer.</Review>< Time>

Started going to their barbershop back on 2009,2010. They all give good haircuts, but sometimes they wouldn't leave it as you'd like. So, I just stick to one barber now.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) It has no respect for a barber shop but for a retired police station since all the time there are the same patrolled patrols next to the building and it has a dental office sing not a barber shop.

No tiene respecto de barbero shop si no de estación de policías retirados pues todo el tiempo están las mismas patrullas parkeadas a lado del edificio y tiene un sing de consultorio de dentista no de barber shop.< /Text>

My BMW recently came off of warranty and needs a 60k service. Paul was very prompt with communication and it really helps that they have the ability to see all my previous service records at the dealership. Very impressed by their honesty, pricing, quality work and service. Texts of the appointment, diagnostic findings, on the progress of the repairs and notice of completion. Appreciate Paul’s experience, honesty and suggestion on signs to watch for for the upcoming but not urgent items.  Glad they kept the employees from when they were independently owned German Motor days (though not all due to the pandemic). Side item- very clean and spacious premises; although I didn’t use it, there is a waiting room. They also have a lock box for drop off/pick up after hours. Glad I found them and don’t have to take my chances of new inexperienced techs at the over-priced dealership anymore. Thanks Paul and your team!</Text>

<review>Very friendly and helpful in determining what work should be done.  They provided a written report that included pictures of worn parts, categorized by how soon each repair should be done - urgent vs at some future time.  Costs were fair and explained.  (Rating would have been 5 stars except for their not keeping me aware of the problems and progress of the job until I called to check later in the day.)</review><Rating>4< /Rating><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Name>George Greenwald<//Name>< Time>

My service advisor was Paul. He performed a complimentary inspection of my BMW. After the inspection, he recommended basic servicing - oil, brake fluid change since I hadn't driven much since the last servicing (over 1.5 yrs ago). Overall servicing was great, fast and cost effective. I'm pretty sure if I took my car to BMW service center they would recommend me more services than what's necessary.</Text>

Paul (Service Advisor) and Rob (Technician) did a fantastic job of fixing a really tricky problem with my BMW. Their diligence saved me thousands of dollars in repair costs.  Rob spent his own time diagnosing the problem and Paul kept me updated regularly on the status and advised me objectively about my service options.  Really appreciate the fantastic technical skills this team has and the amazing customer experience they deliver.  Great place to get your German car serviced, highly recommend.< /Review>

BMW 740 (E38, M62) is my daily driver since 1998. Nicknamed the Beast, it has been mechanically bullet-proof because it is well-maintained. However, @ 164K miles it experienced a timing chain guide failure. If you Google this mechanical issue you find a complex repair is required; between 18 and 30 hours of labor.

Faced with the choice to scrap or keep the car, I turned to the most trusted BMW service shop in the Bay area. German Motor Specialist, recently acquired by Stress-Free Auto Care, still retains it's core mechanical team and chief service advisor, Paul Pisano. All techs have BMW repair certifications & many years of experience. Shop floor is super clean & each work area is well organized!

Paul guided the repair & kept it w/in estimate! No surprises. My mechanic completed the repair using BMW OEM parts & timing was restored to spec. using precision BMW tools. In the process, the engine was nearly completely resealed.

Engine now runs & accelerates smoothly. Beast is still my ultimate driving machine & fingers crossed, could see another 100K miles.

Thanks GMS<//Text>

Hands down the most responsible, respectful and professional shop I have ever done business with. You feel like a priority at German Motor Specialist and the staff is super friendly and professional. Also, this is the first shop that has charged me less than what their initial estimate said. Spectacular experience bringing my car in to these guys! Dealership service but without the dealership prices!</text>

I got an estimate from German Motor Specialists that was fair and they were able to fit me in the same week and get the work done in half a day. They were honest, inspected my vehicle and gave me solid information I could trust, basically confirming the work the other garage had tried to sell me on wasn't necessary. They kept me informed each step of the way while my car was being serviced and were just on their game from start to finish. I'm more than happy to leave a 5 star review for them. Honest, competitively priced service, and one of the nicest, cleanest facilities I've ever seen. I'll definitely bring my business here in the future.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>Excellent experience when I came in to get an oil leak fixed on my BMW 535i.  Pricing was competitive and lower than dealer quoted.  They came in right on estimate and kept me updated throughout, even investigating a noise they’d heard on the car without charging me to do that.  Office was super clean and very professional.  Would definitely recommend.<//text><Name>Jonathan Herbert</Name>< Pics>

I was having a re-occurring problem with my car and was in and out of various car repair shops for 6 years. I didn’t drive the car much because it was a low mileage car so I would pick it up and drive it home where it would sit covered. I was talking with Yinon, a principal with Stress Free Auto Care (German Motor Specialist) and he mentioned having them take a look and was confident they could find a cure. After running many diagnostic exams, they located the problem and it was quite a relief. This particular car is  rare GT2 Porsche. I’m confident in there work and professionalism and will be returning with other cars when needed  Paul was the person who checked me in and from him all the way through was a pleasure.

<Text>Very professional, and honest. I came here for spring cleaning of a 2006 E90 and was given a very thorough run-down of ALL the issues along with their severity. Jason took care of me and was very communicative. For the shop size and quality of service I found the rates quite reasonable. Will definitely bring the car again for its needs.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<review>Lack of expertise, lack of professionalism

They did an inspection of a low oil pressure alert. They diagnosed that sensors and valves are not working. After we changed all sensors and valves, low oil pressure alert was still there. When I finally check oil pressure with an oil pressure gauge, I saw that my car's low oil pressure still there.

I can't believe they returned the car without checking oil pressure after an oil pressure alert. It could cost me a full engine rebuild and a possible law suit against them. They are extremely unprofessional and lacking any expertise that they claim. I had to overcharged fees for an unprofessional diagnosis and unnecessary repairs in here. I'm still trying to reach them but I get no response.

(Moreover, they tried to charge $235 for a part which is just $90 in original Audi service.)</review>< gmap_id>

Because I have inside knowledge as one of the technicians, I know that all the techs are very professional and experienced. I would say German Motor Specialist is on par with going directly to the dealer. Highly reccomend for top service.< /text>

I love this business! They are very knowledgeable, responsive, clear in explaining what the car needs and why. Price wise they are very competitive. If you have an issue that needs repair but the car is still under warranty, they will inform you to go have it done at a dealership, free. They are very fast in getting the work done and accommodate your schedule. If they don’t stock a part your car needs, they will order it and delivery is usually no later than next day. One thing I really appreciate is their honesty and integrity - always being honest about the car’s needs and never pushing not needed or not urgent work. They will tell you something might need attention and also when you should worry about it. Saied, the owner, is extraordinarily helpful and knowledgeable. Highly recommend.<//review>

I found this place through a shop that closed a while ago. I did some research and German Motor Specialist had great recommendations so I decided to leave my car with them.

My E60 needed lots of work. Jason was my advisor and he took care of my car. He helped me plan out and prioritize the most important issues first. He was very thorough and explained everything in detail.

Not once did I feel like I was being taken advantage and lied to about what my car needed — which is exactly what I was hoping to find. I love this shop and had a great experience. I recommend and will be coming back in the future.</Text>

They are very professional, timely, polite guys. I have worked with two service advisors and both of them are great. Unlike dealers who try to get money out of your pockets, these guys have reasonable prices. They have very qualified technicians and pretty sure they give more attention to your car than the neglectful folks at dealers.</Text>

Very happy with my experience at GMS. Easy to schedule, office was clean, communication was excellent, recommendations were reasonable (i.e. no pressure), price was more than fair, and service was quick. Highly recommend using them for the cars they work on. Will definitely go back as long as I have my BMW.< /text>

I had the best experience that is possible when dealing is car issues. I got a laundry list of issues from the dealership for my Audi. I went to German Motors and Jason was nothing but professional. He walked to each issue and explained the impact. Then they did their own check and came back with a prioritized list of issues highlighting what should be fixed and what to watch out for. I would highly recommend this repair shop<//Text>

< Review>
We originally took our Audi to the dealership in San Jose and was very disappointed in the service we received there. We ended up pulling our vehicle from the dealership and taking it to German Motors. In hindsight, I wish we had just done this from the start. Paul, who helped us is amazing. He kept me updated on everything with the car. He emailed me pictures of what they found and unlike the guy at the dealer, he knows what he’s talking about.  I will definitely recommend coming here and will certainly go back when the time comes.< /Review>

<text>I've had issues with some repair shops on my older BMW but these guys are amazing.  Super professional and knowledgable and really seem to have the customer in mind.

I live in Los Altos but actually got a referral from a friend of brother who lives on the east coast so these guys have quite a good reputation.  And it is well earned.

They even discouraged me from doing some repairs on my vehicle when I revealed that I might not be keeping it much longer.  Never known a repair shop that would do that!</text>< pictures>

I have been with German Motor Specialist for many years. During this period of time, I took all three cars of mine to this place for all the scheduled and sporadic maintenance needs. They were always professional, put my best interest in the first place. Even though as a business they must make profit, but it is genuinely not their first goal. For times, they have suggested not to do certain jobs or wait till a later moment. I will certainly go to GMS for all my future car maintenance/repair work. By the way, I have only worked with Paul in the past, but I am sure the other advisors must be equally good. Thank you GMS! Thank you Paul!</Review>

I had to revise the rating from 5 down to 1 star and that for what I experienced with the 'new' owner (investor) of the former 'German Motor Specialist'. He would not honor at all the warranty issued by the previous owner. He has a serious attitude problem to say the least.
Beware of his business practices!
I done some extensive business (car service and major engine repair) with the previous owner that I've rated 5 star service.

Have been taking my 2011 335is to GMS for a couple years now. I bought the car used 3.5 years ago and it seemed ok -- that is until a number of systems started failing as I approached 100K. GMS got the car back into full health, always explaining (with video) what/where the problem is and documenting what they do.

My service advisor is Jason and he's been great at explaining my options in detail, what repairs need to be done ASAP, and which ones can wait. I like that GMS is well hooked into BMW and dealers, so they know about recalls and part lead times, etc.

Very much a fan of the place. Also very much appreciate their shuttle service, too.< /Review>

GMS service is the best. They are friendly, professional, thorough and they always go above and beyond. They once gave me info on a BMW recall and suggested I would be better off getting the work done at the dealer (saving me >$1200 if the recall work was done by a dealer). BMW of MV denied my vehicle needed the work and couldn't find any info on TWO recalls - GMS pointed me to the docs, info on my specific car needing it, and finally after pointing this out BMW of MV they did the work. This reminded me exactly why I didn't like using BMW of MV (I switched to Steven's Creek during my service contract). As soon as my service my contract ran out at a dealer I went to GMS. I recommend them highly.<//Review>

They are awesome!

I bought my first BMW (used 2008 335i) in 2013 and have been coming to German Motor Specialist ever since. The entire team is very good and knowledgeable. I have never got the feeling that I am over paying. They explain each and every charge and answer all questions irrespective of how much time it takes.

On top of that, they work with your extended warranty and also provide shuttle service.</Review>

<review>This place is great, I came here to get an independent inspection done on a CPO car I had just purchased. They caught a major issue that the dealership somehow "missed" in their 300 pt inspection, I took it back for a free repair and avoided what would've been some serious damage down the line. Jason was great to work with, and afterward he recommended me to a body shop that ended up saving me thousands on a repair. Fantastic service by people who care about what they do.< /review><Rate>5<//Rate><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

The service was finished at the promised time. It was an easy process, from driving into the service area without the zoo atmosphere of a dealership to the straight forward consultation with the advisor. While they don't have the amenities of the BMW dealership like a complimentary car wash, I liked not having to deal with crowds and long lines of cars waiting to be serviced. The advisor also gave me a first time 10% discount.</Text>

The inspection of our car prior to purchase was thorough and pointed a few areas that may lead to future repairs, but nothing urgent or major.  It is a 2015 Audi.  Paul provided a detailed verbal report in additon to the written evaluation.   It gave  us confidence to proceed with the purchase.<//Review>

<review>Excellent German auto repair shop. They are very genuine and their work is perfect. They only service BMW, Audi and Mini. They are legit when they recommend repairs on the car. They also do tire replacement if required and purchase tires from tirerack.

They offer a 10% discount when you visit them for the first time when referred by someone. Check their website for details.

< Review>
I've had my Mini repaired here a couple of times, and I'm consistently impressed by the quality of the service. If you're looking for a BMW / Audi / Mini repair shop, I highly recommend this place for their competence and honesty.   P.S. This is the cleanest auto repair shop I've ever seen.< /Review>

Highly skilled and very attentive professionals. They provided me with the detailed photos of the problems with my car and explained everything very well.
Though the price is higher than average i think it's worth it.< /text>

< Review>
I've been very happy with the service received here but my wife recently received a quote for standard break service and found that German Motor Specialist was charging 20% over MSRP for all the parts included in the quote. This is unacceptable fraud. Repair shops receive a discount from Audi on parts. To not pass that discount on to customers is fine but to add a 20%+ fee for parts is unacceptable< /Review>
<pics>None<//pics>< Response>
{'time': 1557878269315, 'text': 'We at German Motor Specialist feel a rebuttal to this review is necessary due to the use of strong and wildly inaccurate language. From a business standpoint, there are many factors that play a role in determining the price of services rendered. At German Motor Specialist, we pride ourselves on providing an excellent service experience from drop off to pick up, as well as the best possible service and repair results. Most of our customers realize and appreciate that our price is fair based on all the benefits, amenities, and overall satisfaction they receive.\n\nSpecifically addressing the reviewer’s comments on the cost of parts, we feel the following analogy correctly summarizes our legitimate and reasonable mark-up on parts we receive from our suppliers. For example, restaurants may receive a bulk discount on wine or other goods from their suppliers, however, we all know they do not and cannot pass this discount down to their customers as they would not be able to stay in business. In fact, especially in the Bay Area where the cost of living has become astronomical, it is an accepted and necessary business practice that markups must be charged in order to pay for rent, overhead, employee benefits, etc. Additionally, we routinely check our prices against the dealership and find we are consistently 20% or more less expensive while still offering the same level of amenities and service. This proves there is certainly no “fraud” or price gouging. Making a reasonable profit by providing excellent goods and services to people is the point of owning a business. In addition, we love our profession and find great fulfillment in helping people maintain and service their vehicle. In conclusion, it appears this customer may be more of a "do-it-yourselfer" type of vehicle owner who is simply looking for the best possible price on parts, etc. and does not see the value in the whole experience we strive to provide to our customers.\n\nWe typically leave this forum strictly for reviews, however, due to the misleading nature of this review, we felt a response was warranted. Thank you for reading and we look forward to meeting your future service and repair needs.'}</Response>

Outstanding service and trustworthy advisors - took our son's 528 in for intermittent squeaky brakes.  Our rep, Paul Pizano, had them inspected and it was determined that there were no safety issues or opportunity for additional damage.  It was recommended that if the occasional squeaks didn't bother us that a break job was NOT recommended at this time.  It's refreshing to get an honest evaluation.
Thanks

I've been a happy customer of German Motor Specialist for 11 years. I first went there at a friend's recommendation. They do terrific work at far less cost than a dealer charges. These folks get people with multiple certifications which you'll see hanging on their wall. They also will not push you into repairs ahead of schedule. Saied Sadrzadeh proved this point yet again on my last oil change, meticulously detailing repirs I could address, but sticking to my request of an oil change only. His approach guarantees I'll be back at German Motor Specialist for my next 100K service, which is right around the corner. Bravo!< /text>

<Text>The folks at GMS are really pleasant to deal with.  I actually executed my repair without even stepping foot in the shop.  The autoshop version of Amazon!  ie "add to cart".  My sister's C300 had suffered the ubiquitous ESL (electronic safely lock) device failure.  They quickly and correctly confirmed what I had known had failed and set out to make repairs.  There were some snafus that occurred by the supplier (not the repair shop) and they honestly informed me every step of the way.  I don't mind unexpected delays as long as they are up front about it.  I have an NHRA licence and also perform a significant amount of maintenance and tuning so they were able to satisfactorily complete the repair and have the vehicle ready for pickup at the promised time.  If ever you want you Mercedes or other German vehicle repaired, I would go see Jason or Saiyeed any day.<//Text><UserId.>105179833888498806789< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>When my 2009 BMW developed strange noises from the engine on the way to work one day, I had to look for a reputable shop in the area which specializes in these types of cars and could diagnose and fix the problem properly. So I went with GMS and was not disappointed. The repair was not cheap because it required taking part of the engine apart for VANOS replacement but Paul worked with me to minimize the expenses and help with rental car costs while repairs were going on. I've also visited the work area and was amazed at how clean and professional it looked. True dealer-like experience for significantly less cost. Highly recommend GMS for those of us who can''t rely on dealer warranty to take care of the repairs. A+< /Review>< Pictures>

Please read this review! - these guys are the BEST: They REALLY know there stuff - And if you love your BMW or Audi as much as me - You wouldn't even risk taking it anywhere else!

Not only are you treated with OUTSTANDING customer respect, but they are VERY knowledgable about every aspect of your automobile.

Talking about superior customer service, I'd like to give a special shout out to Saied, Paul, Jason, Annie and the entire crew behind the scenes that work their magic!

I've already recommended German Motor Specialist to my entire family and friend circle because i strongly beleive nobody does it better!

As you can see, I am VERY impressed with their quality of service, and vast knowledge on the subject at hand. It's really nice when a company cares for you and your automobile as much as they do. German Motor Specialist certainly put themselves in your shoes and give you the best advice possible.

They've always set realistic expectations on when they will be completed with my car, and they have always steered me (pun intended) in the right direction in terms of preventive maintenance and safety items.

Just try them once, and you'll know what I mean.

Good going guys, your happy BMW/Audi customer for life, Rak :o)<//Review>

I went to GAS to get an estimate about an oil leak problem on my Audi.  They requested I get a engine steam cleaning first so I did and the only thing they told me after they reinspected was that it might be a problem in the upper part of my engine.   Wow what an evaluation and it cost me $60!!!  Boy they must think people are stupid.< /text>

<resp>{'time': 1469490435492, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback, and we’re sorry we could not meet your expectations. Unfortunately, in this situation given the vehicle’s age and mileage, the entire engine bay was covered in oil and steam cleaning was the first step toward isolating the area of the leak. After the steam cleaning, we identified that the leak was coming from the upper portion of the engine valve cover/camshaft adjuster area. Therefore, we provided an estimate for repairing the oil leaks. However, further teardown may reveal other components that need replacement that are not visible due to lack of clearance in the engine bay.\n\nWe at German Motor Specialist always welcome feedback, positive or negative, regarding our service and prefer to leave this review forum strictly for customers. However, in this case, we felt further explanation was necessary to prevent misleading information being presented about our service.'}< /resp></record>

3 week update:
Clean gym, staff is professional, and the app makes for a smooth experience. The app tells me how crowded the gym is so i can plan accordingly, and the people are very nice and typically mind their own workouts.
Everyone cleans after themselves and there are always plenty of cleaning supplies to ensure the gym stays that way. The lockers here are better than at other places.                          Surprisingly, the showers are still open (limited-capacity, yet I have seen other gyms keep their showers closed), and the lockers feel like a luxury given the very low membership price.
The touchless membership sign-in is also helpful and offers a smooth experience at the entrance (wouldn't mind if it remained after the pandemic ends).
Worth the price.</Text>

They started charging our card again without informing us that the gym was open again. We don’t feel safe attending the gym and called to cancel. We are not working and asked for a refund of the fees they charge including the annual fee. The manager Howard said “no” and said their is nothing he can do. He did not even offer to work with us. We had the plan for over a year and tried to cancel multiple time and they did not allow us. This is horrible service and they don’t care for your health and safety. All they care about is getting money even when you don’t have it. Will never use this gym again and will not recommend this to place to anyone. Horrible service and horrible people.the reply below is stupid. How about you reply with something that’s actually worth while. I can’t believe you are a business person taking advantage of the Latina. I’m sure your white< /text>

<Review>The gym itself is nice and well mantained. Good for the price. The bad and real bad is it takes for ever to get inside and work out since they make you wait outside due to covid restrictions I'm guessing, which makes no sense because everyone is even more crowded and closer outside then if we were all let in and get on with our workout since the machines are more spaced apart then the people outside. Plus they now close way too early and open up late, this was one of the reasons I initially joined, to be able to workout whenever I had an opportunity and be done in an hour or so. The crowd meter is pointless because there was always people waiting outside in the 3 hours I was there. Maybe it helps for people who don't work or got other stuff to do early in the day.</Review>< UserId.>

I'm very upset with planet fitness, the reason is that my membership expired in July 2020, the 12 months were charged and you were closed for 5 months due to the pandemic of which I could not go to your gym and 8 months later they made me  the charges to my account with what permission if my contract expired 8 months ago.  And I call and nobody answers, who is going to reimburse me for my money that they took without permission?
for that reason I do NOT recommend them because they take money without permission< /review>

Like a lot of people on here we havent been to this Gym since they shut down yet they continued charging us for unused services after they reopened without waening. If any lawyer reads this please reach out to us as this is not just one case but many amd people will happily sign up for a lawsuit. The gym hasn't had all of its services back in order so why are we even being charged for a membership let alone a full membership. Terrible money grab and awful customer service. Do not sign up with this company, you will regret it.</review>

<Review>Been going back since the reopening (6/15). At first, they made you wear a mask during working out which made it difficult to breathe. Now it's optional so working out is easier. I don't understand why there are less handles and bars for the cable machines than before. Also, when there are duplicate weight machines, one is taken out of use which I'm not sure why since they are at least 6 feet apart. I understand why this is needed for the cardio equipment, but why for the weight machines?</Review><Resp>{'time': 1592920835465, 'text': 'Hey Older.

I try to go as early as I can after work and usually I can arrive before the big crowds do. Even when there are big crowds, there are still machines available for you to use and the staff are very friendly and helpful. They keep the facilities clean and looking nice. Lucia, the personal trainer, is knowledgable and friendly. She can help you adjust your work out to fit your body's capabilities and suggest things to challenge yourself. I scheduled an appointment to try the 30-minute Express circuit training with her and she had lots of ideas for how I could make it work for me.

The only drawback for this location is parking. It's located in a strip mall and there are many businesses. The hardest time I had trying to find parking was in the evening around 8:30 p.m. I had to park further over by other businesses but there was plenty of lighting. Usually, I can find a parking within 3 minutes any other time.

Not exactly nestled in the nicest of strip malls, but this place is well maintained and clean. There are tons of machines and it's never too packed.  Easy to get parking and plenty of entertainment on the TVs to help make your run or climb feel shorter than it really is.< /Review>

<review>They improved the showers, and the changing rooms, from when they first opened and they're great now! They have a very decent amount of a variety of equipment similar or better than other Planet Fitness gyms. They also keep on top of the cleanliness and that's awesome.</review></record></dataset><record>

When I first went to the Lakeview Terrace location, the staff was the rudest. The girl was only worried about getting her numbers. Many things weren't explained to me. I called to cancel since I havent even been in MONTHS but didnt want to pay the $58 fee and was told I had to go in person! That isnt very convenient for people. Then the girl told me that I could write them a letter! Who uses snail mail for anything these days?!?!? That location's staff is so incompetent! Theyve been open a year and still they dont know what they're doing!!!<//text>

<review>When in to check  out the gym. look at the membership looked good  until in fine print  it said must have a checking account. Asked  if  I could  pay up front 1 yrs  they said no. They said a friend or family could loan you there checking account  that's the only way. Your company  is loosing lots of business especially  in this area..I work and live in the area been telling  people I know about your business. So will not be recommending your business any more.< /review><Date>1548821393284<//Date>< gmapID>

Brand new everything
They keep it clean.
Staff is not that knowledgeable about the equipment and I don't blame them, they're just workers not fitness gurus or body builders. Most machines have explicit pictures of how to use them. The rest only the experienced guys will know.< /Text>

Simple gym. 5 minute limit on massage beds is annoying. Who does 5 minutes and feels satisfied? Tanning equipment is nice. No sauna.

Update on response to owner reply: Yes, I've talked to them. Their response was that i need to get up every 5 minutes and come back to the reception desk and sign up for another 5 minutes. That's not relaxing. Maybe your policy can apply to peak hours and allow 15 minutes on non-peak hours.</text>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>I was so excited to see a PF opening up near my house, until I saw this location is not 24/7. It makes no sense to close a gym at 7pm. They need to make this gym 24/7 like all the other PF, or at least leave it open until 10pm. People are just getting home from work around 5 or 6pm, these hours are not ideal for people working a normal 9-5pm job. If they don't change the hours, I'm cancelling my membership because I don't want to keep driving to Burbank for my workout. Maybe I'll join the USA Fitness in Sylmar, they're open until midnight 🤷‍♀️<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Review>This gym is cool, good place for 10$ a month. And the yearly fee isn’t too bad.
As long as you don’t go on the busy times there’s enough equipment to go around.
Only reason I’m not putting 5 stars on this review is because the staff doesn’t seem to be trained with customer service, as in greetings, good byes, smilies exc.. but I don’t go to the gym for that anyway. But I work with customer service and for some people stuff like that is essential and makes the location a better place to be in general. But anyway, sign up it’s definitely a good place to workout and they always have available paper and disinfectant so you can always clean your equipment before ad after your sets which is very cool.</Review>< Pics>

< review>
A new gym to the area. All new machines, some that even 24 hour fitness doesn't carry. They have an abundance of cardio machines, although not that many stairmasters. They have an "Express workout" area that offers machines to do every part of your body. If you get a black card membership, it comes with massage chair and tanning bed access. A great place for simple workouts and cardio heads.</review>

<Text>The Wi-Fi is sketch, workers are a mixed bag, bathrooms could be cleaner, but overall a tremendous value for the price. There are plenty of machines so you’ll never be blocked from working out. The 30 minute workout section is an excellent idea. The branding and purple aesthetic they have going is a nauseating plastic design that only could’ve come out of the nineties, absolutely begging for a redesign. The “judgement free zone” thing they have going is beyond tacky, but somehow seems to work. I love the fact that they’re open 24/7, that really makes it for me as I have a whack schedule. It’s really open to anyone, I see all types here, whether it be shredded dudes hunting for the biggest weights they can find or soccer moms trying to stay in shape on the treadmill.< /Text><Time>1552598624579</Time><GmapID>0x80c291afafc4f721:0xfb56b07606593bcd< /GmapID>< Rating>

AND on top of that, they were unprofessional.  If I’ve been sitting and waiting for help at a table and you want that table, find someone to help me! Don’t ask me to get up and move and sit somewhere else for another 30 minutes. Poor CS.<//Review><time>1551150436522</time><pics>None<//pics><name>Teri Shavoz the Writer< /name></record>

Maybe if everyone knew what they were even talking about. This gym will be open 24 hours just like all the rest when it is complete. Please before leaving hate know what is even going on. They even posted on the website that it will be 24 hours when complete, these hours are just times that you can join.</text>

<review>James was a champ having to deal with a super limited amount to offer us. The supply truck didn't show up so they only had what they had on hand. His service, friendliness, and attentiveness were top-notch!
Plus, I think I might be addicted to the Carribean Jerk sauce👌🏽<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Buffalo Wild Wings is always a solid choice.

We stopped in to get some wings, beer, and watch the Oakland A's crush the Detroit Tigers.

They were working with an understandable limited menu.  Didn't matter because then stuff that wasn't being served wasn't on our radar.

We ordered small fries, small onion rings, 20 traditional wings and we both had a few big IPAs.
We went with 3 flavors, Asian Zing, Spicy Garlic, and traditional Hot.

Everything was cooked well and served hot and fresh.  The three sauces were very tasty and the wings came with celery, carrots, and both blues cheese and ranch dressing on the side.

It also looked as if there were limited taps but seemed as if they still had a good variety available.

Our server was the bartender and he was great!  Very attentive and brought our food quickly and had fresh beers every time we got low.

The only drawback is that they don't offer the trivia boxes because of COVID.  It's somewhat understandable but a year into it now, we should be able to get the boxes with a quick wipe of sanitizer from the server.  It wouldn't take very long to do for each box and sure wouldn't add anything to the bottom line as I'm sure they have some kind of sanitizer on hand already.

Again, this is a great spot and I do encourage you to go.  There weren't many people when I was there and I'm sure not only could the restaurant use your business but so could the servers and bartenders.

Go... Enjoy... and tip well...

If you like my reviews, hit the "Thumbs Up"!!

I preferred the Thai whereas my dad preferred the Jalapeño. I personally found neither super spicy and will go higher up on the spice chain next time.

Not five because here previous times before COVID and had meh service and the meal I got I had to return as it was not great.< /Review>< Pictures>

Ordered online and did the 15 boneless and 15 traditional. Only the boneless was marked with sauce on the side.  When we got home and opened our order it was wrong, both boneless and traditional wings came with sauce on the side.  The online ordering is glitchy because we chose 2 sauces for each set of wings and the order only took one sauce per set of wings.  I called in because I was so excited for my wings and ended up with disappointment. I spoke with the manager and asked to have my traditional wings remade or refunded and said I would bring back the wrong order and prove that the order that was input was not the order they fulfilled. Manager said there was nothing they could do. Really? I paid almost $50 with everything it I ordered.
This is how you treat customers, especially during these difficult times? I was willing to drive back with the wrong order to get my corrected order. It is not like I was trying to keep the screwed up order and try to get a free set of wings.  Do not give this Buffalo Wild Wings you're time or money.<//Text>

< review>
First time eating here, service was okay. We arrived about 430pm, not too busy, by the time we left about 545pm it was pretty busy.We ordered the traditional and boneless combo with boneless Caribbean jerk and traditional wings in Thai curry. It took about 30 mins to get the order on the table and when it finally came it was mediocre. There was a very small amount of coleslaw and fries. It's obvious this combo is made for one person, my husband and I decided to share it. It was $18.99, which in my opinion is a little steep for the amount of food that was on the plate but there is essentially enough food in this combo for one person to enjoy. Price point is still high if that's the case. The Caribbean jerk flavor was not as good. It had this distinct, hard to explain taste to it, perhaps it was one of the spices used? Thai curry is pretty spicy but has a really good flavor that I continued to crave after we left. That's the only reason I gave this 3 stars, not  sure if this is enough to bring us back here.< /review>

Interesting place. We arrived and the guy at the door said "Oh, I don't know if we have any tables available"... we look inside, and half the restaurant is empty. We look confused. He says he'll go try and find one. He finds one! We are seated. We get our menus. The alcohol menu (beer, wine and cocktails) do not have ANY prices on them, just calories. Again, we are confused. We ask our waiter why there are no prices on the drink menu, he goes and checks. Comes back, says he can go and find out the prices of whatever drinks we want. Well, where I come from, that is the point of a menu, to provide information and prices about what is on offer. We decide not to drink. Water is easier. We order wings... they are amazing. But I think we will go somewhere else next time.< /text>

<Review>Quality has gone down since it opened. We usually come or order out once a week. It was great for a while but in recent months service and quality of food have declined. If you order in they can never seem to get the order right, to the point that I just accepted what ever comes out of the kitchen so that we don’t have to have another “this is the wrong order” conversation with our server. If you order for pick up your either going to get wings with no sauce/seasoning or they’re going to tell you due to the fact that they haven’t updated the wait time in store, the online system haven’t processed the order in an empty restaurant, an hour after it was placed and you’ll have to wait another 20 minutes for it to be ready. Every single time. Was a great place to grab some wings but they have declined in quality so much that it’s not worth the hassle anymore.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Been to this Buffalo Wild Wings quite a few times and have never had a bad experience. The service has always been friendly and the wings have always been prepared correctly.
If your looking for a good wing sauce but not a spicy fan I suggest the garlic parmesan. What a little kick, try the Asian Zing.<//text>

<text>Ordered online and Paid 40$ for wings that barely had any sauce or seasoning. Not only that but the Fries were stale and tasted as though they had been prepared hours ago.< /text><Gmap_id>0x8085b3ff4860b84f:0x9c8ad8957c150e38<//Gmap_id><user>112872709101329522756<//user><pics>None</pics><Date>1596600426018< /Date>< user_name>

Service was terrible. Waited nearly an hour for food. We arrived and ordered when there were only 3 tables seated. The place filled up and they were getting their food before us. Our food finally came and was cold. No explanation, no apologies. Won't come back< /Review>

Typical 'Wings. Plenty of sports, plenty of wings. Great service and the selection you come to expect. BUT . . . no chocolate shakes!  In fact, no shakes at all. That would have made my visit perfect!  It's a short walk from the Tesla Supecharger array, and a handy place for a quick snack. In short, this was not my first visit. Nor will it be my last. See you there!  (The beer selection ALMOST makes up for the lack of a chocolate shake. Plan accordingly!)</text>

<text>Terrible customer service. Management doesn't adequately train staff before throwing them on the floor. My to go order is now 20 minutes late on a single order of wings so I dont even know if they started making it. No communication between front of the house and back of the house. I also watched three other customers get snapped at by the manager because they interrupted her being rude to her employees behing the to go counter. 0 out 10 do not reccomend.< /text>< pics>

Dec 7th 2019, went to BWW for my birthday. Waited 15 minutes to be seated in a half full resturant. 15 minutes to get a server to take a drink order. 15 more minutes to get the drinks. We had to tell the server to go get them. Server asked 2 times what kind of salad dressing we wanted. Then we had to ask for the dressing when he brought salads with no dressing. We asked how big the tenders were, he said "decent". I had to get up a refill my own drink. Waited 45 minutes for my meal. What dump.< /review>

<text>The service here is always quick, and attentive to my experience. Once I mentioned that I loved the scorpion rum wings after the promotion was over, and the server made an especial effort to get them for me even though the promotion was over. Friendly and helpful staff, more than I expect from a college-age crowd. And some tasty wings even when I ask for them to make it so hot that I cry! And a variety of sports on the tv’s to boot! Make yourself happy and get over there!<//text>< UserId.>

Not the best service. Server was too busy on his phone around the corner. I asked for a refill of my drink it never came. In fact It sat at the soda machine until we got up to leave after paying. Not impressed at all.< /review>

This is a great place to come between 4 and 6 p.m. Especially on Tuesdays when they have half-price original wings. The bartenders are great! We like to order the wings extra crispy with the sauce on the side. Yum! The corona Rita's at $5.50 during happy hour are excellent. You can also get a Jack and cola for $3.50. Great place to stretch your dollar.< /text>

Went to eat and watch women’s World Cup. 27 min to get a server, 10 minutes to get my beer after that, 12 minutes later I get a cold burger and fries.

When I complained to Manager he told me I was served within 10 minutes??

They lost my business and my gift card business. Worse service in 10 years. Went across BWW to Red Boys Pizza. Treated excellent and food was great!<//Text>

This has long been our home-field-advantage location for BWW. The staff here is generally sharp and effective. The sports viewing experience is top notch on ordinary days. I'm not a big fan of paying a cover charge to be in the bar during fight nights or during big sports events like the Superbowl. But when those conditions are not in effect, this is a once-a-week spot for us. (Asian Zing FTW!)<//review>

I have never had a bad experience at this B-Dubs. The staff is always responsive and the wings are always great. My personal favorites are the Asian Zing and the traditional Buffalo wings. It is also a great beer selection. I personally love the Tricerahops. The environment is great. My daughter and I love coming here especially to watch hockey. Normally there is a lot of fun with the other sports fans!</review>

<text>Last night was my first and LAST time ever going to Buffalo Wild Wings. The service was horrible and the food was disgusting. The wings were bland and had no flavor the French fries were cold and tasted stale. Not only did it take the waiters like 20 mins to ask for our orders. When it was dead the restaurant was dirty our table was disgusting and nobody came to clean it!!! Never will I go to Buffalo Wild Wings. I would rather take my money to Wing Stop who actually has amazing wings!< /text>< gmap_id>

<Review>I waited over 45 minutes for my take out order. I asked for the honey bbq and garlic parm sauces as I can’t have spice.  I also asked for utensils as I was at a hotel.  After waiting 45 minutes I got my food. My hotel was 2 minutes away.  It was cold. Both my sauces were incorrect and spicy after specifically making sure to ask which ones were mild.  And also no utensils.   I guess a correct hot order was too much to ask for.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><rating>1<//rating></record></dataset><record>

I am in love with this place! Delicious food and fun for the kids.  They have little tablets with games that are free that kept my mugs entertained while we waited. So much to choose from on the menu.<//Review>

<Review>Let's start with the food. The fries are alright, I've had better from fast food joints. The cheese curd burger... Well, the cheese curds themselves weren't that great and the beef patty was too thin for the amount of veggies and cheese curds.

Now I'll turn to service. It wasn't super busy the evening I was in, but it was still a LONG wait to order our food then wait for our drinks. By the time the food came out, my burger was just above room temperature.

Seeing as this was my fist trip to a BWW, not a good first impression.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Review>Went here for lunch a few times and the food was always good, the place was quiet and not busy, just a low key place to get some fried pickles and wings. I like the naked tenders. I like this location as well, I recommend coming here.< /Review>< user_name>

<Text>Waitress wasrude.  She never smiled or was friendly. I asked her for my sauce which comes with the tender she never gave me my sauce, she walked by asking “ is everything okay” she literally walked by never stopped before reminding her of the sauce. Service was horrible. The worst service ever ! I never ate my chicken tenders, so unprofessional. 1 star is too much should be 1/3 star. Kayla Hernandez and I might be talking about the same waitress same description.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x8085b3ff4860b84f:0x9c8ad8957c150e38< /GmapID></record>

There's a great variety of wings and they taste good. However, the restaurant itself smells strange, there often isn't that much sauce on the wings (even ordered extra wet), a lot of the food beyond the wings isn't much better than average, and the staff can be very hit or miss. Probably best if you ordered the food to go.

Update - they somehow mucked up an online order, so 2 stars for failing that.</review>

I am not one to ever write a review, but a shorter, Caucasian woman, probably in her 30s, was a waitress for our booth except she took forever to even take our order. As we waited a while we called over someone to see if they can take our order by now, keep in mind that it was not busy at this time. So once we got this other woman’s attention she took our order. I then noticed that a man with his kids sat down to their booth in front of us and the caucasian woman took their order quick. That was when i realized that she purposely ignored/avoided us.<//text>

Just another Buffalo Wild Wings BUT... I really do happen to like chicken wings in general and several of BWW's wing flavors, in particular. So it really hit the spot. Those Jamaican Jerk Wings, are the BOMB!</review>

Horrible costumer service. Went in today with my boyfriend for dinner and our servers name was Chloe. She completely ignored me through out the whole time I was there and only paid attention to my boyfriend. We had asked for Pepsi but she brought us Diet Pepsi. I let her know it was Diet Pepsi and she responded, “ oh, are you sure?” And looked over to my bf and asked him if his was okay and my boyfriend told her the same thing I I had told her. She went to the soda machine and tasted it and came back with new ones and said, “ I didn’t find anything wrong with the Pepsi but here are some new ones.” After we were done she put the check in the table with a box and said, “I have separated the checks for you guys let me know if you guys need anything else.” I was confused because we did not tell her to seperate our checks, she just went out of her way to  seperate them. I found it completely disrespectful and inappropriate. I hope you guys take hands into this matter and fire her or something because I really enjoy going to Buffalo Wild Wings in Petaluma and I would hate to stop going here because of this girls bad attitude and her lack of customer service.
Thank you.</text>

First experience, and they had no bread. Which meant half of the menu could only be served if it was wrapped in lettuce. So instead of following my gut and leaving, I opted instead for the Ultimate Nachos. I got about five bites in before I stroked out from each of the ridiculouly over-salted ingredients on the table, including the boneless wings and cheese curds. In the end, three large appetizers (and three necessary waters) came to $63. I will never return.< /Text>

Substandard service, substandard food, as usual.  Probably try again in about a year or so. Hopefully won't regret it.</review>

Food took a while to get out even when the place was half empty. when the food came, one entree was cold. Salad was overpriced. Blue cheese had no cheese. Poorly managed. Aleast the hot wings were meaty and tasty.</review>

<review>Horribly managed.  We had a booth near the entrance and could hear everything.  Every customer that came in was greeted with an apology.  They've apologized so much, it's habitual!  Each new customer was told that no booth was available.  There were at least a half-dozen empty booths with dirty dishes sitting on them the entire 2+ hours we were there.  One group of customers, seated outside, marched back out after waiting 30+ minutes for someone to come by.

Our experience fit the same picture.  I ordered a beer immediately and didn't get it for at least a half hour, after our food came!  Most of the time we were there, my glass was empty.  Not one dirty dish or glass was carried away during the entire 2+ hours.

On top of that, this location has really high prices.  A medium order of wings is $19.49.  Fries, potato wedges, and drinks are not included.

There is something wrong with Buffalo Wild Wings.  This location has below average service for the chain, and BWW as a whole has well below average service.  As much as I love Asian zing wings and potato wedges with ranch, I just can't justify going any more.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Staff seems that they are doing you a favor by being there. Bartender was very inconvienced by us. I ordered only wings, no drums and that didn't come out rite. Very poor value as well. 17 dollars for a boneless and traditional combo that should be 10. Good beer selection but here I n cal, that could be found at way more friendly places that APPRECIATE your business. Not a chain that could care less.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Good spot to watch sports with your friends. Lots and lots of tv's everywhere, included a massive projection screen above the bar. Huge selection of beers, a top-notch happy hour (4-6 M-F), plenty of munchies on the menu, and a friendly staff make this a worthy experience. I just wish they still showed the UFC fights...</Review>

I ordered cheese cake bites what I thought would be perfect finish to a perfect meal. Once I received it I realized there was a hair long anuf to wrap around a megalithic structure. Now I have worked in the food industry for over a 10 years  so I didn't make a scene just informed my waitress about in a calm discreet manner. She took back the dessert and took it off of my bill. However I didn't receive a single apology ,or offered a remake. I would have left a tip if she at least said sorry. Idk maybe she seen me as someone trying to get a freebie either way it was a terrible  experience.< /Text>< pics>

This was a disaster.  First time at buffalo wild wings ever!  Had to ask where order was.  They said 15 minutes or free.  When the food "finally" for there some of it was gold and the hamburger ordered had a "burned" black bun and nor even the slightest bit of embarrassment from the server.  Complained to the manager who was apologetic but a little too late to do any good. Free coupons offered but decluned. Terrible first impressions. Wont go back.</Text>

Wings and football, what more do I need to say? Oh, and the mini corn dogs are delish. Always loved the boneless wings but finally started eating the bone-in wings for the legit experience. Lots of screens and staff are friendly about trying to accommodate everyone's viewing preferences. Usually only one game has audio, though, so practice that lip-reading.<//text>

<Review>Hit or miss. Half the time the staff is on point and busting their tail to handle busy nights. Other times they may treat you like you shouldn't have come in at all, while they chat with their friends at tables or at the bar instead of bringing out the order that was ready 10 minutes prior.</Review><date>1482105284310<//date><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I can't believe how bad it was. It's like they purposely tried to make the food as disgusting as possible. How can a salad with wings be that horrible at a place with wings in the title. Please dont eat here or any BWW.</text>

<Review>Great for eating Keto - the only downside to this location is, the Blazin Rewards system is never functional so you can't use your points or earn points....
Even if you take your reciept and try to enter it yourself, you can't because it is never recognized!
Bummer but good wings if you don't care about racking up discount points...< /Review><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

I'm going to give it a 3 because the wings are just too greasy. The beer is spendy, even though the breweries are within spitting distance. And - it's noisy in there. Could not even hear the football game, I had to make up my own commentary .. and .. I'll be the first to admit I suck at that.<//Text>

< review>
I came here with 6 other moms and a boat load of children on a Monday night to watch the game while eating dinner and I'm impressed with how well they dealt with our table full of toddlers. As a parent, you cringe at the thought of others having to clean up after your child inevitably makes a mess, but the staff was so helpful, friendly and understanding! I'll be back again soon!<//review>

<Text>Decent food, terrible service.

Last time I came here I was denied service (1 hour before their closing time). I was told that there wasn't a server for our party.

Terrible place to eat, would NOT come here again.< /Text>< name>

Went to BWW to watch a UFC fight and it was standing room only. Luckily, we were able to get a booth for our group, but the manager forced us to make room and add strangers to our table. It's the first time ever that a restaurant forced me to have dinner with stranger. The food is mediocre at best and is exactly what you would expect from a chain restaurant.</review>

The selections are great and our server SABRINA ALVERIO was on top of it. She is one of the best servers ever. I have never been to this place and I would recommend it to others in the area. If you like sports and want to watch them with sounds and cheering fans then go here...I hate to say it but they are now the best place in Petaluma to watch BIG Screen sports.</Text>< Pics>

Not to excited about BW3 anymore. The price for the wings is crazy now. I can get his wings for half the price.</review>

<Review>Typical BBW; Lots of TV's with every kind of sport on, loud, many beers on tap, and decent food.

But other than that, the wait staff can either be top notch, or the worst you have ever encountered. I have had: Charging full price on happy hour drinks, and wouldn't give a refund. Completely getting our order wrong, and then charging me not only for the screw ups, but also the ones I actually ordered. And don't go to any BBW if there is a PPV event there, they never told us we were going to be charged 25 dollars automatically until after we ate our food and got our bill. That took corporate to get my money back on that. (25 per table is to cover what they have to pay for the event is what we were told)

We have been back there a couple times, and it has been better, its decent wings, and you can go yell at tv if your sports team is on.<//Review>< Pics>

They have good wings but it's very expensive especially for just being chicken. It's way to easy to make them yourself.< /review>

(Translated by Google) A place was advised by a friend. He said that the sensations will be remembered for a lifetime. When we ate the wings before crying, looking at each other. The service is good.

Место посоветовал друг. Сказал, что ощущения запомнятся на всю жизнь. Мы когда съели крылышки до плакали смотря друг на друга. Обслуживание хорошее.< /review>
