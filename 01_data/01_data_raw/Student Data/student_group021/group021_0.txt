In the cut. Great place to shop if you're looking for a piece of mind. The store had a variety of things that I need needed and didn't need. The fruit & meat was fresh, the coolers were nice and cold, the people were friendly. Oh and nobody was laying in front of the door. Major plus.< /review>

<review>The Dollar Tree has morphed into what the 99-cents Only store used to be (the right price for what-the-heck items.)

Today, I see better items and feel that a dollar is a great offer for who-knows-what. Besides, the NOT 99-cents Only store has fewer items to purchase... and the Dollar Tree has more.<//review><gmapID>0x80914260b0de9dc9:0x9a44765eb51bb238</gmapID><pics>None</pics><Time>1612556237485</Time>< user_name>

Love this store, it's close enough for a fast emergency run, but has everything for a weekly run. I've gone for washclothes, triple antibiotic cream, hair ties, birthday cake, and dog food (not all in the same trip..lol) and always find that one thing I need. And affordable...i love this place.<//text>

Today at Dollar general I felt the most warm welcoming I felt like I was worth a million dollars because this store clerk   named Judy from Merced Dollar general made it feel that way it was a great experience I've never felt in any store that I've ever been to and she had a top 100% customer service she's great nice kind very very knowledgeable  of product and where the products are and how the store does ADS .  So I'm very grateful for that encounter at Dollar general at Merced and keep up the good work Judy your work and your kindness will not be overlooked I appreciate it and have a nice day and make sure that young lady gets bonuses she deserves it.her name is Judy from Merced Dollar general thank you and have a great Christmas and New year's.< /review>

I'm begginning to love the convenience of this store at the edge of town. It has a lil bit of everything. Food, veggies, snacks, drinks, hygiene, houshold necessities & more. Even got a qt of motor oil once. Without having to turn back and head into the crazy 5 o'clock traffic.< /text>

Remodel done recently.  Now you can get your shopping cart over to the check out stands.  Great improvement.  I’m still learning where things have been moved, but really like the new layout.  Great customer service!<//Text>

<Text>From the begining...ive had to check my receipts in this store very carefully because they lie about their prices. Just about everytime i go in there, im overcharged for something and then when you take it back in to make them correct it, they have an attitude. Somehow i can walk out with just a couple bags for a high price everytime.</Text>< GmapID>

The great thing about this place is that everything here actually IS a dollar, unlike some other "dollar" stores. Wish they had a little more in choices but still very good. Employees always nice and helpful.< /review>

Like the variety of items from fresh meat and produce, frozen items, household goods, etc. One-stop shop! A bit worrisome tonite as a guy ran past me as I was exiting the store, he was carrying a hand basket full of items. A store employee ran after him but the thief had a vehicle with driver and door open so he could jump in and go, which is exactly what happened.< /text>

Everything here may have a "quick expire date" butf if you are on a bugpdgest, are you really gonna keep a cupboard full of food just because? The meat is good, the produce selections are fresh and they have everything from mops, to books you movies. Why waste money shopping name brand stores when Dollar General is there?</review>

This Dollar General in particular is my favorite place to go to. Reasons why, well, it's clean, customer service is good, the people there are usually in a good mood (in my experience), the store carries what I need in a convenient location and price. This place good all around.< /text>

They pretty much have everything you need there's a few things I wish they would Kerry so you don't have to go to another store. Like dry salami more varieties of ice cream other varieties of dog food. But the guy that handles the freezer section that works there is awesome very knowledgeable and will help you anytime. And another guy that works on the floor that's really cool. I wish I knew their names right now but I don't have them with me.<//review>

<Review>Ok so I was going to go 3 stars but compared to it's competition and other DGs this store is definitely above the average. Just know that this is not a big box retail, department store nor is it a pharmacy. I will call it an expanded convenience discount market. Just remember when you are "shopping" here. It's way better than Scamily Dollar!<//Review><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<text>Ok so I was going to go 3 stars but compared to it's competition and other DGs this store is definitely above the average. Just know that this is not a big box retail, department store nor is it a pharmacy. I will call it an expanded convenience discount market. Just remember when you are "shopping" here. It's way better than Scamily Dollar!</text>< pictures>

Great prices great store but there is one employee that is rude all the time and has a bad attitude I don't know if it's just a bad day but there's no reason to act like that toward customers... "she's a Mexican lady heavy set with a lot of tattoos and a lot of jewelry "</Text>

Stood in line for over 20 minutes growing a beard waiting. I moved to another cashier that had opened and waited 15 minutes and got nowhere. Left my Laundry Soap and ran out and went to SaveMart. The SLOWEST CHECKERS EVER!!!!<//text>

This place is amazing literally they have the best service! They have a lot of open pool tables available and it's still busy they take the right appropriate actions for covid-19 and they play the best music there you can also download an app to play whatever music you want from the Jukebox it's cool. It's so easy to have a great time! I'll definitely be going back and referring people here hope this review helps if you're considering looking for a good place to hang out at.< /review>

The billiard halls in Sacramento have been around for a long time. Sharkeys was one of those places that was known as a shady hang out back in the 90s.

Nowadays it's a different clientele, different music, different management.  Gone are the bad crowds that used to frequent this place.

It would be nice if they updated the ambiance, arcade and the building itself, but it's still a good enough pool hall to go play a couple racks. .<//text>

This place is under new ownership and you can tell the new owner cares a lot about his customers' experience. I'm looking forward to seeing what other changes happen.< /Text>

A nice place to hang out after a long week. I went there with a friend and we enjoyed a good couple of games for the time we were there. Price wasn't too bad and I would definitely go again. Plus, its right next to a Krispy Kreme!</review>

<Review>This is a nice park with a play structure, a couple of benches in the shade, and a single picnic table.  It connects to the Alameda Creek trail and has two trash cans for waste items.  It's officially an on-leash park but virtually everyone ignores this which is why it's not 5 stars.  The vast majority of the off-leash dogs are very well behaved and under voice control, but the few who are not ruin it for everyone.  Be careful if you go there with you leashed dog.  No restroom facilities.< /Review>< pictures>

This park is very clean and nice. Play area is also good. No swings available for kids. No restrooms nearby. View is good and good for small picnic. Park is not crowded. Loved it here.</review>

There are a couple  benches and one table. A couple big beautiful  trees. Bart does go by but it's far enough  away there nothing to worry  about. Always peaceful.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>They literally put a quarter piece of 1 slim meat and 1 slice of I'm guessing Korean pear? Stingy portions for a $11.50 cold noodle meal. I was hoping the cold broth would be atleast good but it wasn't. It was lacking in almost every way incl flavor. This place was a disappointment. Only reason for two stars is ample parking, ample tables, and I don't like giving a 1star review unless it was a terrible experience. I probably won't go again.<//review><user_id>108760844283373060935</user_id>< resp>

Great place for Cold Noodle. I've been eating this cold noodle for last 40 years and thus is one of the best place for that. And also they have other authentic Korean food that's outstanding.
I highly recommend this place.</Text>

Their specialty is Naeng-myeon. The broth is excellent, and has a clean refreshing taste. It's not overly seasoned. The buckwheat noodles have the right amount of chew and the texture you expect from authentic buckwheat.< /review>

<review>I see reviews of "high prices" but I actually thought the prices weren't too bad compared to many other places in the K town. I had mul naegmyung (cold noodle) and mung bean pancake. Everything was very satisfying! Also their service was phenomenal considering that it's K town.... I usually don't expect good customer service in this area but the servers here surprised me. Thank you for keeping the quality service and food!! 👏🏼<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

The nang-myun is ok but portion is small.  They don’t offer refill noodles for free so it is actually pricy.< /text>

This place is in my lunch routine for a reason.

On hot days, you have to get the 'mool naengmyun' (cold noodles). So good.

Been coming to this place since I was little.<//Text>

Even though this place is known for their naeng myun (cold noodles), I keep returning for their tasty galbi tang (short ribs soup). Whether the weather is hot or cold, this savory soup satisfies and energizes me.

The service is always great (I appreciate the smiles even during their busy times) and there are dishes for the whole family to enjoy. Don't forget to start your meal with the gamja jeon (Korean potato pancake) or nokdu jeon (mung bean pancake)!<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Mutual and menu changed in Jangsol rice bowl in Ojangdong noodle house.
The taste of cold noodles is starch, but the food is too late
The white noise (the back music) and the sound of the guest are mixed and the food enters the mouth and enters the nose.

(Original)
오장동 냉면집에서 진솔국밥으로 상호 및 메뉴가 바뀌었어요.
물냉면맛은 별넷인데 음식이 너무 늦게 나오고
화이트 노이즈(백뮤직)과 손님 떠드는 소리가 믹스돼서 음식이 입으로 들어가는지 코로 들어가는지 도대체 식당이 정신이 없음.</Review>

Other foods and atmospheres are not up to 5 points, but this is a house where you come to eat naengmyeon, so only the taste of naengmyeon is given. The foods including naengmyeon were generally not irritating and tasted neat.

(Original)
냉면 맛으로만은 5점. 다른 음식이나 분위기 등은 5점까지는 아니지만 여기는 냉면 먹으러 오는 집이라 냉면 맛으로만 점수를 줍니다. 냉면 포함 음식들이 대체로 자극적이지 않고 깔끔한 맛이라 좋았습니다.</Review>< pics>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I like self parking without valet parking.
In addition to cold noodles, I like hot soup and Korean food that kids love. Especially Bukgjjigae are so fond of children that I can go easily when eating out.

발렛파킹 없이 셀프파킹이 우선 맘에 들고요
냉면 말고도 따뜻한 국 메뉴와 아이들도 좋아하는 한식이 있어 좋아요. 특히 부대찌개는 아이들이 너무 좋아해서 가족외식할때 쉽게 갈수있는것 같아요< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<user_name>Kelsey Xavier< /user_name><gmap_id>0x80dceeecddcecfa3:0x9056e5ed8d52ab23<//gmap_id><text>My family and I lived in this apartment complex in 2017-2018 and we loved it. The apartments are so nice and fresh, the maintenance team is incredible and the office staff is on point. There were some problems with our downstairs neighbours at the time but the office was so kind to us and understanding. They genuinely cared about our family and let us do what was necessary to have a peaceful place to live.

We had such a great experience with them that we are actually moving back to the complex in a couple months and we couldn't be more excited. We look forward to another fantastic experience! Also shout out to Micaela for being our go to gal whenever we had questions during the leasing process!

If you are looking for a safe, comfortable place to raise your family, this is the spot for you!</text>< UserId.>

I was just approved for an apartment at Camden Crown Valley, and the application process was exceptionally easy! Johnny and Janet were both very helpful and friendly, this place has great reviews and looks to be a beautiful property, I'm very much looking forward to living here! I'll update this once I've actually moved in.

Update: I moved in to this complex at the beginning of April 2021, and I'm loving it so far! It's been 3 months, and it's a good property. It's nice and quiet for the most part, you can never tell what kind of neighbors you'll have though, so your mileage will vary. The apartment itself is roomy, love the washer/dryer in-unit, central air is very efficient, ceiling fans are great. All in all, I recommend this apartment complex.< /text>

The community is really nice and quiet, and it is almost walking distance to a lot of stores. 5 min away from the freeway and the metro.

Our leasing consultant, Johnny Munoz has been super helpful as we've been preparing for our move to Camden. Very professional, personable, and responsive to all of our questions, calls, and emails.<//Review></record>

We lived at Camden Crown Valley for two years and absolutely loved it. Great management, maintenance, and amenities. Every maintenance request was resolved within 24 hours and usually sooner, always with excellent service! You can tell they care about residents. The only real recurring complaint people have is about car break-ins—we never had any issues in two years, so we can’t speak to any problems about that. We would recommend Camden to anyone!< /text>

I must say, apartment living can be dicy at times with neighbors above you, below you and pretty much all around you but let me just clarify how AMAZING living at the Camden’s is! First off, it’s quiet as desert out here! You could hear a pin drop! Second, the staff is amazing and so willing to help! Johnny Munoz is awesome! I’ve known him since day one here. (I only move in about 8 months ago) but he has been wonderful every single time! He ALWAYS gets back to me via email within what seems like hours if not minutes... he’s very polite, always has a good attitude and is always willing to help! Even with my crazy requests, he never even flinches and always does it with a smile! The maintenance staff is incredible too. They are so respectful and kind and make me feel so comfortable when they’re in my apartment fixing something. I’m super happy with apartment life here at the Camden’s! Thank Johnny Munoz and the rest of the staff for everything you do and for always making sure I’m taken care of!! Stay safe, all!!</review>

One of the easiest move ins I’ve ever had! Johnny was excellent to work with. The property is very clean and quiet. I was referred to Camden Crown Valley by a friend who lived here a few years back and he had the same experience. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice place to live with a staff who takes pride in their work and strives to provide the best living experience.< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>The Crown Valley team and property is great. Very quiet community and friendly neighbors. The staff is friendly and answer any questions. Sheyna gave me and my husband a tour of a few floor plans, and again as more became available to see. We weren’t ready to move in right when we toured, so she checked in with us and kept an eye on pricing for us. When a good price became available in the time frame we were ready, she helped us apply and put a deposit down. On move in day she was extremely helpful and answered any questions we had. She is super friendly and professional! So far we are loving living here.< /review>< username>

Camden Crown Valley has been our favorite apartment experience so far. We love how the complex has elevators going from all three floors straight down to the parking garage. Included in our rent is internet, cable, and a valet trash service that picks up our waste from our front door every single night around 8pm. My husband and I chose the 1 bedroom floor plan and it’s actually very spacious and is definitely worth what we pay for rent, which is a very reasonable price. The maintenance team here is friendly and speedy. The office staff is wonderful as well and we always try to go down there when Sheyna is working because you can’t help but have a great day after talking to her! We also love how they offer reserved parking spaces to rent because we’re able to carry our baby just a few feet from our own personal parking space right into the elevator. The neighbors are friendly and we’ve never had a problem of any kind while living here for the past 6 months. About once a month they also have a food truck come for a few hours and the food is always to die for. We are so happy here and Camden deserves a 5 star review for sure!< /text>

<text>Apartments are nice however there is alot of theft and vandalism.  There is no camera's or any sense of security. I saw a Mercedes left on floor without any rims and three car's broken into. I would not recommend this area especially since you would pay more money. In the event where you rent here it's a must to have a tech  package with your lease. Staff  is nice and are sincere and i mean some service workers. The office people are only nice upon the start then you won't even see them. Vastly different from my experience and they don't fully explain everything you have to paid for. In the end you will find out at the end of month. Good Luck<//text>< Pictures>

I got home home from a Christmas party and my Christmas package from my parents was delivered while I was gone and ripped open, stolen and the box left by the trash. I was told I couldn’t have a ring door bell because my apartment faces another apartment-like all of them btw. I did speak with management and was able to transfer to another apartment on the garden side of the complex. I do think there needs to more security around the complex, such as cameras since the visitor parking has all moved to the resort side. Upper management should take note as I spoke with the office and they stated they have been telling upper management this. I did see someone with a ring doorbell so I’ll be getting one soon, but I already feel safer in the new apartment. We had issues with a few things in our new apartment, but maintenance fixed it super quick. Parking isn’t difficult which is my reason for staying in these apartments. It’s super close to the 5 and quiet (on the garden side), and has a lot of doggie walking areas with actual grass. I do appreciate Johnny, Andrew and Shayna helping me with my issues and concerns.</review>

I have lived here at Camden Crown Valley since February 2014 and just love it. The staff and crew here are on top of it. They communicate well with the residents both through email and the portal website. The property is well maintained. Anytime I requested something get fixed in my apartment, it was addressed quickly and the issue was resolved. My wife loves the fact that the apartment came with washer and dryer so she doesn’t have to go out to do our laundry. I really like the pool area with the two huge BBQ’s. I am happy here and plan on renewing my lease when it is up.</Text>

Camden Crown Valley is a very nice community. The Leasing Office is very kind and helpful. They do their best to help residents in every situation. As far as some of the negatives other people have wrote about, I have not seen it myself. I also have dealt with mold in the past and I know it's due to humidity and if you leave your windows open or do not use the ventilation fan in the bathroom, it can more than likely cause mold. This is the best apartment complex I have ever had. Also I think everyone needs some exercise sometimes, if parking is an issue. So thank you very much Camden!< /review>

I have been with Camden for about a year now. They have always been so kind and helpful. I've submitted work requests with them and have always had an action taken right away. The apartments are clean about beautiful. They offer door side waste removal service, which I have never had with any other apartments. They are constantly making upgrades around the apartments and always having giveaways and blood drives. They support our military and even have fund raisers for our veterans. The A/C is wonderful also! Oh and it's right next to the Crown Valley shopping center and the Kaleidoscope, so you are able to walk to the movies and maybe have a few drinks and walk back.<//Review>

We are new to Camden, have only lived here about a week but so far we are very happy. Being an interior designer it is very important to me that my surroundings are aesthetically pleasing. The finishes in the apartments are beautiful, updated and contemporary. I love my wood floors, stainless steel appliances, beige walls, white base boards, paneled interior doors and the open floor plan is great for entertaining! The grounds are also kept up very well. There is plenty of resident and guest parking which really amazed me. We do have a loud neighbor but I have not yet brought it to management's attention. It is also a little pricey but overall we are so happy with our new home, I can see myself living here a very long time!</text>

< Review>
This place was awesome for the first 10 months. Then they changed the visitor parking policy and everything went down hill. Multiple visitors have been towed from the property (up to 10 in a night) because of the poor signage and change in policy. There is now 0 visitor parking after 5pm. Your visitor will have to hope/wait somebody leaves. Tracy the new manager and their district manager Liesl only worsen the situation. I will not renew or recommend this complex to anyone. Also my car was broken into while parked in the garage and have heard from security that they get a lot of break ins. Do not rent from this place!!</Review>

To ensure our residents have ample parking to come home to, we do need to enforce our parking policy to restrict guest parking to designated spaces.

DON'T LIVE HERE. The staff is extremely unprofessional and uninformative. I was not informed about basic rules and regulations about parking. I drove to California from Arizona to specially talk with my leasing agent about my contract but it was brushed off and I wasn't given any information. My car was towed without my knowledge (I thought my vehicle was stolen and was going to call the police). But even if you're a resident your call will be towed if you don't have a permit. I was not informed about being towed and didn't know about parking permits, nor was I given one. I looked all through the contract for permit information and could find nothing. I feel violated that my possessions can just be taken with out my knowledge. We will not be living here ever again and are counting the days until our lease is up.<//Text>

Management is deceptive and frankly isn't interested in improving the experience here. They post stupid comments to the community website saying how happy they are that "you" are a resident, but they do nothing to actually deal with issues or be honest with people.

Take these Google reviews, for instance. The reviews posted around the time of this one are being encouraged as a chance to win a Valentine's basket. They want people to review them and post a screenshot of the review to be entered to win a date night gift basket. Obviously people writing a review for such a "raffle" will be posting *positive* comments, so it's probably wise to not take seriously any reviews posted between the writing of this review and Valentine's Day.

Camden forces you to pay for cable through Cox, but doesn't give you a special deal. You pay full price. EVERY resident pays full price. They send you your water bill only a few days before it's due, and expect you to have it paid by the due date. They claim they're "going green" as an excuse to not provide paper for the printer in the computer lab/office area. What bull! They're trying to save money, but are so full of crap that they lie to their residents about it. Lots of trash everywhere, people smoking cigarettes and pot everywhere, lots of college kids and immigrants who have no sense of responsibility or consideration for those around them, etc.

Basically, this place is a garbage pit. I'd write pages on it, but I'm guessing Google has a word limit.

PS: Apparently Austin Lapp thinks people who leave negative reviews must just have had a single bad experience. Which means Austin Lapp is what's known as "a moron". Austin, I'd have numerous experiences, and calling out Camden for using tricks to get good reviews isn't contradicting my comments about lousy management. It's supporting it.

EDIT: I just wrote a long post. Google ate it. *sigh*<//Text>

Recently just having a baby I am now home 24-7. It is very quiet during the day. Couldn't be a greater more conveniently located apartment complex being walking distance from the mal. my wife and I feel safe going for walks and love that they have an off leash doggie area! The gym is always clean and usually no one there. Lauren is the leasing office agent who helped us find our place and is always friendly when we see her. We have had to call maintenance a few times and they are always quick to show up and solve any issues. Being a military family we have lived in many complexes in different states and this is our favorite so far! Definitely recommend.<//Text>

I Have seen some amazing things in my life. But nothing equates to a complex that does unthinkable things to residents. There is a MAJOR mold infestation all over your property in multiple units. Then I find out from several residents that there is a history of creating problems for the families who live there. I was thinking of renting there... NO WAY! It sounds like living there would be like living in HELL with the Devils Favorite Children there to harass me and my children. Treating people with dignity, and taking care of the health concerns of your residents should be paramount to your business. It is SUCH A SHAME that it is not. Profits before the health and well being is your motto... Making money is fine and warranted for any business... But when it impacts families... and you drive people to unspeakable depression because your complex management seems to not have a human side, there is a problem. Bottom line.... STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!< /Text>

< Review>
Alarms are going off by malicious pranksters who pull on the alarms.  Considering how much I have to fork over to live here you would think that they would at least have security cameras. and warnings hanging up to warn the pranksters that is an offence and that they will be prosecuted.  I don't know what is a false alarm and what isn't.  My pet is going crazy and so am I.  I am seriously considering getting my attorney involved as this is a serious safety issue.  I don't know what to believe with the alarms.  I don't want to get caught inside during a fire if the real thing happens and everyone thinks it is a false alarm since the alarms are always going off anyway.  Super hazardous and I am not happy at all.<//Review>

<review>Not a very good experience. They have a guy who hauls trash every morning  with this go-cart that pulls trash bins and its sooooo load! everyday its like hearing construction going on. It goes by your apartment all day. Next I had a HUGE ant infestation and flys in my apartment. Ive asked them to fix it from which they came in 3 times to fix but still have a HUGE infestation. you leave a little bread crum out and its a trail of ants seconds later. I've never had an  ant problem like this. They have this weird trash system that makes you pay 30 something dollars to get your trash removed from your doorstep. But the trash people won't take a small bag they will only take a big bag. which is ridiculous and I'm paying for it. The pool is sometimes disgusting. One time I went and the Jacuzzi was pretty much brown. The pool is also not heated and always has stuff floating in it. They also have a bad bee problem at the pool. Many people were upset and complaining. To be honest I think its a bit overpriced.< /review>< Pictures>

I would be happy to address each of your concerns directly and rectify what I can. Unfortunately, the trash collection is done the way it is due to Waste Management and the way they have set up the property. We can request that they are more careful on the 2 days of the week they complete trash collection. I can understand that the noise of the bins can be distracting while collection is taking place. I would also like to rectify the pest situation in your home. I can absolutely speak to the pest control company regarding your concerns and see if there is anything else that can be done. Unfortunately, flies are not a pest that can necessarily be treated, aside from insuring that your window screens and weather stripping under the door are operational. However, we can continue to treat for ants. When it gets hot in the summer ants become a larger problem. We are happy to work out additional treatments for you. I will look forward to hearing from you so we are able to rectify the issues you are experiencing. Regards, Tracy Mattos Community Manager Camden Crown Valley tmattos@camdenliving.com'}<//Resp>

As noted by others, Camden often encourages residents to write reviews in order to win prizes. While I have no intention of entering such raffles I thought I would still provide my insight.

After living here for 15 months I just recently renewed my lease. My rent increased by 10% and if it wasn't for the convenience of being able to walk to work from the complex I would have relocated. Rental quotes also fluctuate, sometimes by hundreds of dollars, on the website, so be careful when doing your research online.

The resident information number directs you to a call center and on several occasions I have been given contradicting information from the representatives. For instance, I was told that as long as my parking permit was displayed I could park in a spot for an extended period of time. The following day a leasing representative sent an email to the complex with parking reminders stating "The maximum amount of time to be parked in one resident spot is 72 hours."

Parking: While parking is by permit only there are no assigned spots, so finding a place to park your car after work or during the weekend is often impossible and requires parking in one of the other buildings. As I said above, residents are only able to park in the same spot for 72 hours or their car will be towed, so hopefully you have a friend or family member willing to move your car if your are taking any more than a 3 day vacation. Visitor parking is always nearly impossible to find.

Technology package: There is a mandatory "technology package" that is not included in the price of your rent. It is an additional $62 per month and only includes expanded, non-HD, cable. This price is not negotiable, even if you sign up for additional cable or internet though COX.

Plumbing: Within the first year of living in my apartment I had three separate water leaks. One required filing an insurance claim (which thankfully Camden requires you to have,) and all three required multiple days of a dehumidifier running 24/7 to dry out the unit before the drywall or cabinets could be replaced.

Trash fee: The trash fee is based on the size of the unit, not occupancy. So a family of three or four pays the same amount as a family of one living in a comparably sized unit.

Overall the renovated apartments have an inviting, upscale look but do not make up for the larger issues plaguing the complex.</text>

<text>I moved in since January 2014. Staying with Camden Crown Valley has been a wonderful experience so far. There is minimal paperwork and smooth transaction in signing the leases and moving in. Mary was the one who helped me to find an apartment here. She was very knowledgeable in the apartment layouts and very keen in activties in Mission Viejo. (moving from Las Vegas). Plus Camden allows transfers to different units within the apartment complex as long as the tenant notifies them 30 days in advance. I was needing a larger apartment so there was no issues with transferring to a new unit.

Maintanence are always on top of their work. I was locked out of the apartment 2 times during my lease and the maintenace crew was able to unlock the apartment within 30 minutes. (Mind you keep an extra key in your car in case you get locked out since it is $50 to unlock your apartment every time lockouts do occur).< /text><Rating>5<//Rating><time>1402613445942< /time><gmap_id>0x80dceeecddcecfa3:0x9056e5ed8d52ab23<//gmap_id></record>

AVOID THIS APARTMENT COMPLEX!! They will vandalize your vehicle and the vehicle of your guests if you are parked in the wrong place. They also over-charge for utilities based on the size of the apartment and not your actual usage. The charges become excessive. They will also manipulate final account statements and add erroneous charges to make sure they take all of your security deposit and possibly owe money.< /review>

Fun little corner liquor store. Nothing fancy, but they carry some different wines and beers you can't find at chains. They have a whole wall of hard A that ran the gamut of top to bottom shelf liquors. Easy parking for cars and bicycles (they have a rack inside the store). Definitely worth a peek if you're in the area.</Text>

< review>
After reading reviews that touted Ledgers' big selection, I was excited to add to my Scotch collection during a visit to this place. However, it did not live up to its reputation at all. It took a while to get someone's attention, and when I did I let him know I was looking to add a few uncommon bottles. I was prepared to spend a lot of money, excited about finding some new bottles. When I asked him for a specific brand, he showed me where it was and there was only one bottle, the most basic variety. I was confused, because even some grocery stores have more than one variety of this brand. He then showed me a different corner of the store where there was another bottle. I then wandered around the store and found two other varieties in seemingly random locations. The entire time, I needed him to help me but he was busy helping a customer select lottery numbers. The impression I left with was that this is essentially a glorified corner deli that has quite a lot of bottles, but there is no real expertise or passion here. I ended up at Cask in Oakland instead, which has a decent selection, is better organized, and pays more attention to the customer.< /review>

This place is the place if you're a fan of spirits or Belgian beers or bitter liquor. I'm a fan of all three. Very knowledgeable staff and they also have a huge amount of disorganized stuff in the back so if you don't see what you are looking for, ask.<//Review>

Ledger's is the place for all your liquor needs, if they don't carry it then it was either a bad liquor or it's not possible for purchase. I love Ledger's, you can go in and ask for the most obscure bottle and they know exactly where it is located in their grand assortment.<//Text>

Need a birthday gift for a scotch drinking friend but don't drink Scotch? These are your friends. Need a bourbon to try that won't break the bank (and also isn't Buffalo Trace or Knob Creek)? They will happily spend 30 minutes with you in discussion about all the finer nuances of bourbon. Vodka? Does it really matter? Just kidding! They've got your artisanal, your gluten free, your organic, your grass-fed... Whatever it is you're looking for! Plus ALL of the fixings, mixings, bitters, shakers and everything else a good cocktail needs. Pay the extra dollar or two per bottle over Bevmo and do yourself a favor. Parking in the small lot - entrance on University, at Acton.< /Review></record>

Walls and walls and walls of hard to find beers, wines, and liquors. This place was incredible, my only complaint really is that they're not super helpful when trying to find something new to try and half the time they don't know what's in their store. Love this place though!<//review>

Best liquor store in Berkeley for sure, and a serious contender for best selection in the East Bay. Tons of whisk(e)y, craft beer, amari, cocktail bitters, modifiers, and more. Great rum selection, as well. Doesn't look like much from the outside, but the selection is fantastic, and the folks are nice and quite helpful. Free on-site parking, and indoor bike parking.</Text>

<Text>A family-owned liquor store that's been owned by the same family for generations- from what I hear, all the way back to the repeal of Prohibition. The beer selection is almost unrivaled in Berkeley, but be prepared: it's not terribly well-organized. Their liquor selection is quite good, and their collections of bitters and beer glasses are very large as well. I just wish they were open Sundays or Mondays.</Text><date>1482711860597</date>< UserId.>

Excellent selection of hard to find spirits! They carry multiple overproof rums while most stores don't carry any. Most of the staff was very helpful finding the bottles I wanted. They stock checked when they couldn't find one and let me know when they're getting it back in stock without my having to ask for either. A lot of the spirits they carry are behind a counter, so you have to ask for someone to get you things. Unfortunately, the one person helping us didn't know their stock well, didn't acknowledge he didn't understand what I was asking for, and stood in front of the area we were searching blocking my view. Other than that, great experience. I'm excited to go back.< /Text>

Thursdays are Pliny days, one bottle per person. Should avoid on Thursdays, because they have an awesome selection of foreign and domestic beers and you shouldn't limit yourself to what the fixie crowd thinks about anything. Don't be sheeple.</Text>

This establishment falsely advertised that walk-in’s can easily get in for bar service while they only offer reservations at VIP tables and bottle service, which makes people come as walk ins to stand in line and make the club look more interesting and fun than it actually does. In reality, it’s boring, unnecessarily expensive, and pretentious and classist. Establishments like this should be banned to be honest. I don’t understand why people party in ugly Los Angeles when the NYC queer party scene is there.< /review>

<text>oOooo.., fresh new lounge to hit the Broadway scene. It's all nice and done up. Word on the street is they just opened up earlier this year. It's definitely worth checking out. Synergy hosted a party there and we got in with no problems or anything. I like the inside feel of the place... very sleek and new. Not a huge dance floor, but it's manageable.< /text>< Pictures>

Amazing!!!! Healthy food that is still hearty & nourishing. Definitely recommend going for dinner, as the appetizers are the best part. Giving it 4 stars because I wasn't as impressed by the brunch menu, it was missing some of my favorites (shishitos, corn cakes, beet poke, etc.)<//Review>

Bootsy Bellows exceeded all my expectations. We had a private event there, and everything was on point. The ambience and venue is extraordinarily beautiful, the staff are amazing, and the drinks were remarkable. The entire evening was magical and our attendees all had a memorable time at Bootsy Bellows!< /text>

<Review>My comments are the same as everyone else the bouncer cheeseburger randy wouldn’t let me in
I was with 5 girls and a promoter. Randy ( the bouncer) for some odd reason with all of his schooling and what not - decides to not let me and my other male friend in.
Randy you have way to much power and should learn to control the cheese burgers rather then the people you let in.</Review>< resp>

I like this place a lot for the burlesque shows they do at "half time". And for the kitten dancers all throughout the night. The marionettes are hilarious too. The only downside to this place is how tiny it is. It gets really packed and it's hard to move around without getting drinks all over you. There is a private room in the back with lots of space and a separate bar,  but it's exclusive to get in, and you probably have to pay.  This is a high end club. Expect to drop atleast $200 when coming here. And to wait in a long line unless you know someone.<//review>

Will NOT ever go here again with all the rude employees here.
I did not meet one nice person that works here. I am surprised they are even making it .

I should have checked reviews first!
Even if you know someone (ONLY way to get in) it is so not worth the time.
AND EVEN THEN not letting someone in that KNOWS the owner and has confirmation on a tweet to have fun and shouldn't have a problem getting in??? WOW (that person didn't get in and left)

When you go in it is very narrow sweaty hot and not a fun atmosphere.
Bathroom was disgusting... its a step in and turn right back around.
GROSS!!!!

BOOTSY get it together with your workers.
You can be firm and I understand you need to do that, but don't be just plain INHUMAN!!!
I saw way to much of that and it made me sick!<//text>< Pics>

Went there tonight, just to get turned around because 2 of my friends didn't make the "cut". This place is super racist and full of lookism. If you aren't a blonde, skinny, or super rich, DON'T EXPECT TO GET IN.</Review>

< Review>
So I just got back from one of the worse nights at a club EVER.  I had my iPhone X stolen out of my purse.  One minute I'm using it to take pictures, the next minute it is no longer in my purse.
Right before I noticed my phone was gone, one of the bouncers was yelling at myself and my brother because we were sitting too far on the edge of OUR table (which we paid for) and encroaching on the neighboring table.  This guy was so unnecessarily rude and aggressive.
My brother and I actually apologized to him simply to get him off our backs.  At that moment I noticed my phone was gone.
The bouncers that worked there treated me and my friend like second class citizens.  They were did nothing to help us, and in fact, ended up being aggressive towards us as we were asking them what our options were.  I guess to them, we were just another group of belligerent women, even though neither one of us was even buzzed at that point.

I later found out from one of the security guys that patrol that area, that Bootsy Bellows is notorious for people having their phones, wallets, and passports stolen.

If you go to this place, secure your belongs BIG TIME!  I will NEVER step foot in that place again.
I warn any future patrons of this establishment.  The bouncers are horrendous and your things are at risk of getting stolen.</Review>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>The most racist experience ever. Even if you've been personally invited by the DJs and put on the guestlist, don't expect to get in unless you are a thin blonde Barbie or a bratha who's friend with the bouncer. The bouncers are rude, violent, power tripping aholes asking for a lawsuit. They don't even have to ability to create an organized line, that's why everyone is shoving from all directions to attempt to get through the front door.<//review>< rate>

<Review>This probably was one of the hardest doors I've seen while waiting outside I saw many people who would have easily gotten in other places just waiting outside. In Hollywood the quality of a door is one of the most important things at the club and Parker the dude out front runs the door very well (tall dude with long hair). One you inside you notice a upgraded Trousdale fresh with more sparkly chandeliers, posters, and mirrors, watch out for the mirror by the bathroom I almost ran into it twice. Although the music was pretty lame, I felt like Arquette took hints from his former spot Beachers, once you get into the VIP area (with a wristband) you are greeted by glass wall on your right with girls dancing inside the booth, a pretty cool effect, at one point in the night I saw David Arquette playing with the puppets behind the glass. The worst part is that they split the club in half and the VIP area is a separate room and they make it near impossible for people to go in there. One of my worst experiences in LA.</Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Review>I've been taking my dogs to Banfield for 5 years now. I started at the Florin road location and, even when I moved out of the area, I continued to go to that one. I moved even further out, so now I come to this one. I'm pretty sure that Banfield goes through some sort of quality check when hiring their vets. They're all great. My first dog hated other people and would get aggressive (no matter what I tried, he was sassy), but he liked the vets. My current dog is friendly to everyone, and this facility is no exception. The staff are nice, professional, and busy but never too busy for you.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x809ade9e8ef8a25d:0x167c79520655ee5b</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We love Banfield and everyone who works there. Our two girls get excited every time it's "time to go see our friends at Banfield!" Everyone there treats our pups with the utmost care and compassion. This is not a scary or impersonal pet hospital, everyone (pets especially) becomes part of the family. Thank you all for how well you treat us (Janie and Julia too!)<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNe09D80fECxI5lsU_qQohkXqvA02IbitXhNP9H=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1545410477571, 'text': 'Thank you so much for the positive feedback about our staff, KC!

Banfield in Carmichael called me to say they were cancelling my dogs appointment because I haven't purchased their Wellness Package. They are saving all of their appointment spots for members only. Definitely will not use or recommend them<//text>

I absolutely love Banfield I took my cat Kodi there for years up until the time I had to put him down and they was there every step of the way letting me stay with him for as long as I wanted. Now I have a doggy and today is her first visit they made he feel so comfortable ♥️💙< /text>

< Review>
The receptionists aren't helpful or friendly. They called me this afternoon and cancelled my appointment 2 days before they were supposed to see my pets. The receptionist said that the appointment was being cancelled because they aren't takng new clients but they knew that my pets have never been to their clinic before they scheduled the appointment.<//Review>

<review>The people here are so kind. We're putting our cat down on Friday after like a month or two of treating him, and I feel so confident that he'll be in a peaceful and compassionate environment.

Everyone here has been so kind and loving to us and our cat, we definitely won't be taking our other cat anywhere but here.

I can't really gather all my thoughts together right now but Google prompted me to write a review and I just wanted to say how wonderfully kind and competent and dedicated the staff here are.

Thank you so so much for everything you've done for my Leo. ❤️</review>< Name>

We're thrilled to hear that you and Otis enjoy visiting Dr. Erickson and Radillo and how attentive and friendly they are.

Dr Erickson and Radillo are super attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. I never felt pressured to buy any additional unnecessary services here and whenever I seemed concerned about a recommendation they were happy to explain why it was needed and I was always given an option to defer or reject a treatment. I love that they always call the next day to make sure our pup is ok after a visit.

Definitely get the pet care plan, it's definitely paid for itself between all the diagnostic stuff and vaccines.<//text>< user_id>

I hope that Dr. Radillo never moves! Our pets love her so much (when it comes to vet visits, we have a very fiesty feline and a slightly anxious pup due to past vet experiences, so that is saying a lot) and her staff are the best. We have been using Banfield for a long time, and had a few different vets, but Dr. Radillo is a kind, compassionate, knowledgable professional. Her love for animals is very obvious and we are very fortunate to have her and her staff in our area.</text>

Great people who take great care with the animals.  I brought my dog in for the first time last week and I was very happy with the care.  She's an older dog and they were very gentle and I really appreciate it.  The cost seems very reasonable and I will definitely go there again and recommend them to anyone.< /Text>

We've been using Banfield as our vet for about a year and a half now, and have never had anything less than a positive experience with them. Our cats are on the Banfield Optimum Wellness Plan, which is absolutely worth the money it ends up saving you. They're always very quick to accommodate if you need a same or next day appointment, and always extremely friendly and helpful.< /review>

My pup had a torn thumb nail and it was so close to the pad I didn't dare cut it myself.
Bansfield fit me in the same morning, and sedated him and took the nail off.
It's a nice clean place. The staff is nice and Munchkin seemed although a little groggy, just fine.

They took good care of him.
I'd go back.

Not sure I'm for the selling of the monthly subscription they try to sell you, but I guess everyone needs to make money

I'd reconsider if my pup needs more then once a year care.</Text>

Extremely professional staff. Everybody there is so cheery and ready to assist you and your pet any way that they can. I would recommend Dr. Tiedigan. She's very good at getting back to you on the same day or at the very latest, the day after if you call and have a question about your pet. They treat you and your pet like a superstar when you are there. And what's nice is that a lot of the medication that they prescribed to pets are actually there at Banfield.</Text>

<Review>The set-up and design reminds me of Del Mar in St. Augustine, Florida, except that this place has a larger lobby. I hope to get a tour of the whole facility on my next visit. But from what I've seen so far, it looks a lot better than any other Banfield I've taken my furry babies to. Heck, it looks better than some doctor's offices (for humans)!

Easy appointments. Quick visits. Easy parking. Clean lobby & exam room. Coffee station while you wait for your furry kid. Friendly staff. Personalized service. First Banfield that I am pleased with. Oh, please get rid of that fake cheese in the exam room, lol.. Over-all, keep it up!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rate>

Friendliest service I've received in a long time! Made me want to switch careers and work here with this wonderful staff! My baby bunny went from Respiratory infection and G.I. stasis to full recovery in a week with their medicine, help and instruction! It's so nice having an exotic pet specialist so close to home.</text>

<review>Great experience overall. They have a wellness plan that can save a lot of money in the long run for your pet(s). They seem a little unorganized at times when leaving messages and picking up pets/paying which is why I took off one star. Regardless of being a little chaotic and disorganized, I do enjoy their thorough nature during appointments and follow up calls after procedures.</review>< user>

these people are lying saying the plans don't cover anything - my dog got hit by a car, just his tail and leg - and they ended up saving both, now you can't even tell! office visits are free under the plan - and so was almost everything else - I only had to pay like 10-30 bucks each visit and had to go every other day - ended up pay less then 200 bucks for something that could have costed thousands. My other rescue chihuahua was in really bad shape when I found him - same thing, they basically saved his life and didn't charge me a thing - and I got the best plan so it covered dental - something that would have costed thousands barely a few hundred. go somewhere else and ask them to do anesthesia and remove teeth for a few hundred. They will look at you and laugh. Only an idiot would give a negative review.<//Review>

<review>Make sure you google complaints about banfield before bringing your dog here. The staff was very nice, but we ended up spending over $500 for puppy shots, our dog ended up sick over it.

<Review>Such friendly and loving staff. They follow up the next day and are genuinely concerned about your fur baby. Dr. Teideken is amazing. We took our little guinea pig Spike to her...he was diagnosed with a UTI but ended up having a kidney stone.  My son and I had to make the difficult decision to let him rest in peace.  While my son and I broke into pieces over losing our baby, the staff and Dr were so caring. Dr. Teideken promised that she would take care of our baby and make him comfortable before the euthanasia. I know she kept her promise.  While our story didnt end well, I couldn't have asked for a better experience and with the Banfield family especially in this tough time.  Thank you Banfield family for your kindness!< /Review>< Time>

I have visited the Banfield location on a few occasions, I met Chalon Tiedeken, DVM, I was amazed when I saw her exam my fur baby, the best I have to say, in the 7 years i've had my Schnauzer! I do have another vet, but Banfield is around the corner and for quick visits I go to Banfield.
Everyone in the facility is so nice and friendly! I would recommend Chalon Tiedeken, to anyone who wants a very thorough exam of their pet! I  haven't had the  opportunity to meet the other DVM'S, so I can't post anything about them!  Thank you!!< /Review>

After 10+ years at another Vet in Simi Valley, we decided to give American Veterinary a try with our new pup.  Dr Cruz and team were amazing at every visit with the new pup.  Appointments were on time, staff were friendly and efficient with awesome customer service.  Dr. Cruz is extremely caring, knowledgeable, and down to earth.  Not once did we feel like just a transaction.  Which was one of a few reason why we decided to switch vets.  Overall, just a great experience.< /Review>

I was worried about my guinea pigs feet and wanted to make sure he didn’t have any infections of some sort and I called the minute they opened. I wanted an appointment ASAP, the phone was immediately answered and they had no appointments available after I got off work, I was told they could call me if they got a cancellation for that day and we set up an appointment on Monday, just in case. I received a call just an hour later saying they got a cancellation and could see my guinea later that day. They brought us in very fast, they were efficient, obviously knew what they were doing and how to handle it as needed. :D Definitely will be taking my animals here for any future visits they may need!<//review>

<review>Dr. Cruz and the entire staff is amazing!! We have a bit of a difficult cat (he's big and mean to strangers but amazing with us). We've been to other vet's that haven't treated him very well, and have been hesitant to take him to a vet again. But EVERYONE at American Vet Hospital was amazing! They were patient with us and treated our boy well. Dr. Cruz is calm, sweet with all animals, and the nurses were so kind and understanding. I wish I knew everyone's name to thank them properly..but Blimps and his family thanks you guys!</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1hqUtO7nipaBo4rUyKV6QnFKIqu8Bb14ZOcvS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Once again Dr.Cruz and his staff are amazing. Zorro was in for shots and check up! He is a nervous  dog and they allowed us to walk him until dr Cruz came in. Helped him be less stressed about the visit. Thank you Dr. Cruz ❤️<//review>

I have been to MANY Veterinary Doctors in my life, but not one has been as caring, compassionate or knowledgeable as Dr. Cruz of The American Veterinary Hospital of Simi Valley.

Dr. Cruz saved the life of our cute little boy, Benjamin. (He’s a 5 year old Havanese Puppy.)
The second day we had Benjamin he was 8 weeks old he got really sick (pneumonia). Luckily Dr. Cruz’s office was open on that Saturday. Our little guy was really really sick. Dr. Cruz was so compassionate. He examined Benjamin and told us he would be able to help him and get him back to good health.

Dr. Cruz did just that!

Dr. Cruz was not our Vet at he time. Our regular Vet’s Office was closed, but our daughter had told us how GREAT Dr. Cruz was with her puppy and people.  Dr Cruz is now our Veterinarian!

I like the detail he goes into to make sure you are aware of your animals needs for shots, check ups and tests. He makes you aware of what is best for you animals.

This last Christmas, our daughter’s new Pup, got really sick. She was life and death sick, but Dr. Cruz used all his skills and knowledge to make her healthy again. She has been fine ever since.

Dr. Cruz is in tune with the animals you can tell how much each patient means to him and he can tell what’s ailing them and uses his proven medical methods to return them to full health.

I can’t say enough about Dr. Cruz’s talents or his bedside manner. He is GREAT!

If your looking for a Vet or unhappy with the treatment you’re getting at your present Vet, you need to call The American Vet Hospital of Simi Valley and book an appointment to see this amazing Veterinarian, today.

Trust me, you will sleep better, every night, knowing Dr. Cruz is there for your cute little critter when you need him.

Thank You Dr Cruz for being such an Amazing Veterinarian!< /Review>

We have recently switched vet offices due to American Vet overcharging and under helping.
Staff is nice, however they want to run blood tests and xrays every time we bring our cats in. This, along with their costs of a $50 office visit (same charge too for any time you bring pets in even if it’s a recent follow up), disposal charge of $7.00, and the list goes on, was hurting us and our pets moreso than finding a solution. The past three times, we went there running all these tests with no clear diagnosis.

We had been going to American Vet since 2007, but things have changed there a lot. Recently, our cat was sneezing a lot and needed up just needing an antibiotic for her nose to clear her up. We first brought her into amercian vet and $800 later we were out. After bringing her to Park Animal Hospital in Simi Valley, she was cured and it costs us $135.

We had suspicions that Am Vet had been uping their costs but it wasn’t until we finally had the courage to try a newly recommended vet that we could see the huge difference in staff demeanor, cost, and ultimately, happiness and health of our pet. It is with great sadness I have to write this review in hopes it will help someone else. Thank you.< /text>

We love Dr. Cruz and his staff.  They recognize that our two lab mixes, Dewey and Harley, are family and they treat them as such.  They are truly professional and will go the mile to ensure your pet's health.  Their facility is clean and divided so that cats don't mix with dogs.  :-)  We love American Vet Hospital!</Review>

<Review>I have been taking my dog Filo here since she was 3 months old. She is turning 12 this year. Dr. Cruz goes above and beyond in care at this facility. I’ve never had a need to go anywhere else because at 3 months old when Filo was infested with worms in her intestines and I had a hectic work schedule Dr. Cruz stayed in after hours to see Filo so we could start the meds right away. My list is long with Filo’s health care needs that were satisfactorily and very kindly met at the hands of Dr. Cruz and his team each time. The staff is patient, polite, well trained professionals and most of all kind, caring and understanding. The facility is always kept clean and smelling good. I cannot say enough good things for the service provided by Dr.Cruz. From little things to big things it’s professionally handled with the kind of care that is very rare to find in today’s time. The love for animals is apparent. Salute to Dr.Cruz and team. Job well done above and beyond always.< /Review>< Pictures>

We have been going to Dr. Cruz for more than 5 years now. When I first went to American Vet I needed a bunch of tests done for a very sick little dog. My former vet was going to charge a fortune. Dr. Cruz completed all of the tests and then some at a substantially lower cost. All of the staff are very professional, kind and compassionate. Over the years they have become more like family to us and our dogs love them all. Dr. Cruz is very thorough and really takes the time to explain the diagnosis,  treatment plan, options that are available and doesn't hesitate to refer out if a specialist is needed. They always follow-up the next day to see how our dogs are doing. We have had nothing but positive experiences with American Vet and I wouldn't hesitate one bit to refer others to them...They are all top notch!</text>

Sorry folks. It's not a shameless plug, but more of a  global response to the  negative reviews that have been responded to on YELP and other sites.

Please take any review that is written for any business with a huge boulder of salt. Out of the many clients that a business sees in a week, month, and years, there will always be the less than 1% that will take to the public forums to vent very biased and often erroneous recounting of their experiences.  The problem with the latter is that a business owner is not allowed to provide their side of the story so the consumer can make an educated decision.

<Text>The receptionist & dr Cruz were nice. They have separate entrances for dogs & cats, the place is clean. Since it was my first time there, the consult was $26 instead of $59. The recommended x-ray for the dog would have been $500 if we'd decided to do it which I think is very expensive. Also since it's an older dog I asked about the fees for euthanasia & all that... as we weren't ready to go through I wanted to take home the quotes which showed the breakdown of the charges incl cremation & was told it does not leave the office. I find that a little shady!<//Text><pics>None</pics><userid>102161050218780706324< /userid></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Cruz saw my bird on an emergency basis and was very professional. Unfortunately my Conure needed his wing amputated witch was handled immediately. I thought the charges were reasonable and the care provided by his staff to be professional both at the time of the surgery and the aftercare. I will be taking my 8 year old red Doberman next Tuesday for a second opinion on problems he's having. I would recommend Dr. Cruz to my friends and am very happy with the care I've received.<//Text>

My dog has been a patient of Dr. Cruz since 2008. However, based on my recent experience I will no longer be taking my pet to him.   I had made an appointment to update his shots and utilize items left on his wellness plan. I had purchased the yearly wellness plan for my dog and had not utilized all the components of the package by the expiration date of August 28, 2015 and was told they were no longer available.  I was unaware that everything had to be used by that date.    I didn’t not use the parvo virus booster, fecal test and the second wellness check that equated to about $100.  The office did send me a postcard indicating my pet was due for those unused items and other items as of 8/15, which prompted this visit.   I requested to speak to Dr. Cruz to see if these items could still be honored since it was October 3, 2015, about a month past the expiration, and I had already paid for these items.  Plus I would be paying for additional items during this visit.  The receptionist talked with the doctor and reported that the doctor said, no they could not because it was past the expiration date.  Just within the last 12 months I had spent nearly $3000 in veterinary services for my pet and thousands of dollars more over the duration of my business association with this veterinary clinic.  So I was very disappointed that Dr. Cruz was unwilling to honor services that I had already paid for.  Even more disappointing is he was not even able to come to the reception himself to explain, but instead stayed in the back and had his receptionist be the bearer of bad news.  It seemed he couldn’t be bothered to explain himself directly or take the time to discuss this with a customer of 7 years. Wow, talk about making a customer feel unimportant.  It was clearly communicated that he was not interested in maintaining my business, so the receptionist was very nice and made me a copy of my pets file so I could find another veterinary for my pet.</text>

Everyone seemed a little rushed when I had first walked in with my kitten. I was extremely worried for my cat when I noticed something wrong. It seemed like they wanted to dose my baby and get me out of there quick. They gave my kitten shots that I was not told of until afterwards when they made me pay the fees. Extremely upset about that. The checkup was great and the doctors seemed sweet and gentle with him, until they placed a lot of fees for me. When I came in for just an exam, it was 25$, I walked out paying 200$ and am asked to pay for a follow up checkup of 131$ in three weeks. I find this to be ridiculous and unexpected. Who makes you pay for a follow up check up??. Another, I asked to see the doctor to speak with him and the workers had told me that he just left. The doctor immediately just leaves his shift the second they close and I find it to be unprofessional because I had so many questions. I don't plan on coming back or reccommending to anyone i know that has a pet. Ridiculously over priced and hazardous with the medicines and shots given.< /Review>

<Review>I don't know if things have improved, but about five years ago my beloved cat's nose wouldn't stop bleeding because of having cancer on it.  I left him with the technician at American Vet Hospital and I forgot to tell him something, so I went back into the examining room where I had left my cat in his carrier.  To my horror, the tech was trying to shake my bleeding cat out of the carrier over the floor.  My cat was hanging on to dear life.  I was appalled.  The tech immediately stopped and was embarrassed that I had seen him.  Needless to say, I never went back there again.  Also the Vet took $400 worth of blood tests, which my next vet said where worthless - didn't reveal a thing.  Not a very good experience.< /Review><name>Lani Bartlett<//name></record>

<text>We have been coming to this restaurant for at least 4 years. The food was good for the “price” and the service was great, very friendly staff.
We have been supporting them along with our other favorite restaurants all through Covid. Tonight we ordered our regular food; pot of tom Kai coconut soup, large white rice and an order of Paradise fried rice. The total was over $36. When we looked at the bill, the base price of the Paradise fried  rice went up from $11.95 to $15.95, an almost 35% increase (along with everything else, although they are still using the old menus so you don’t know how much the food is until you get the bill) I understand that times are difficult and restaurants have been especially hard hit with Covid so I could have accepted the price increase but then they also charged us $3.00 extra for the shrimp because unlike before at $11.95 that included both chicken and shrimp now it only includes one, to have both its extra. So in order for me to get the same dish as I had before at $11.95, it cost us $18.95, an increase of almost 60%!!! So not only did they increase their cost but they also give you less for more $$. Unfortunately I will no longer be supporting this restaurant, the value simply isn’t there.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>The food is really good here. I live nearby ao when I want thai food I go here, but when it comes to take out it is not worth it. I ordered take out from them twice and both times they gave me very little meat. When I eat there they give me a good amount of mear but when I ordered takeout they gave me less than 6 pieces of meat and it was the small pieces of pork.< /text>< Pics>

My favorite Thai joint near home. Friendly wait staff. Never overly crowded. Great lunch specials. Been going here for years and have never had a bad meal. Very authentic food  as can be, and I have been to Thailand so I can verify!</Text>

Joom is a GEM!
The food is always fast, fresh and delicious
Never mind that lunch special is what you call bang for your buck.
The ladies who work there are lovely and attentive
A really nice staple in the neighborhood.< /review>

<user_id>117275204022001606686</user_id><Text>I used to go to this restaurant very often since my daughter used to live close to it. Now she lives too far from it and I have been eating Thai food at other restaurants in the Lakewood/Long Beach area. On a day that I was in Downey, I decided to go back. Seems it's under a new management. They changed the decoration of the dining room. It was very clean. The staff was different, not as attentive as the previous staff, but the menu seemed the same. Service was a little slow compared to my previous experiences. They keep the lunch specials, but I noticed that the portion size has been reduced. Still a bargain though. Food was delicious. I would say this is the reference I use whenever I rate Thai food. For me, this is still the best I have ever had. I'll definitely will go back if I'm in the Downey area.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80c2cda042502fa5:0xc915cf45c3c4bb4d<//gmap_id><time>1578621157026< /time>< pics>

<review>Parking can be a challenge. The place is not very big. As you walk in it has an authentic feel, and you're immediately greeted. The food is good, the problem is the service. After you are served they forget you until it's time to pay. The food is too expensive for the level of service. I probably won't be back.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Very delicious!  I ordered the Drunken Noodles. I am such a wimp when it comes to spicy food, but it was the perfect amount of spicy with tangy. I fell in love instantly!  I went in the afternoon around 4pm and the restaurant was slow with only about 3 customers.  The staff was extremely friendly and the cook/ owner even came out to see if we liked the dishes. Overall excellent food and service. It doesn't look like much on the outside, but inside is a true oasis. Extra points for a tasty Thai Tea! I am a regular now!<//Text>

COCKROACHES AND HAIR IN FOOD!!!

We found a hair at the beginning of our meal and a cockroach at the end of our meal. We spoke to the owner and he said “bring the food so i can complain to the chef” like what ????????
He didn’t want to give us a refund  BECAUSE WE WOULDNT TAKE THE ONE PLATE WE HAD LEFT SO HE COULD COMPLAIN TO THE CHEF???</review>

<review>It's small but I was pleasantly surprised at how it was inside. Clean and homy, there were lots of customers inside and it felt cozy. You can order take out or dine in. I ordered the pad Thai, and it's not as sweet as I'm used to having it at other places, so that's pretty good for me. I will definitely go back to try other foods. They have an extension selection on their menu.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<text>Hands down THE BEST pad thai that I've ever had. The noodles are nice and chewy, the sauce is flavorful and they don't skimp on the protein. My other favorite items are the boat noodle soup, thai bbq ribs and the beef salad. Service is great; everyone is very friendly and helpful. My boyfriend and I have come so often that they practically know our order even before we place it.< /text>< pics>

<review>Don't understand why there were so many good reviews for this restaurant. Disappointing Thai food. Not authentic at all. Basil beef was too salty. Pad Thai was too sweet and taste was off. Papaya salad was meh at best. Service, however, was wonderful. Waitresses were very friendly and cheerful.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>The Thai tea here is THE best we have ever tasted!  Been coming here for years just for the tea!  Lol And it's a silly thing to be grateful for,  but they are the only place around with super crushed ice.  During the hot summers,  omg wow... Such a refreshing treat!  Their food is yummy too and the staff is very nice.  But oh,  that tea!  🤣<//Review><response>None< /response>< Rating>

<text>Food was good! But they need more employees! the wait time wasn't too bad, I was here on a Monday afternoon and if you like lime with your pad thai I suggest you bring your own, they gave us one little slice of lime for 2, then I asked for more and they gave me 2 more little ones, no biggie the taste in food is more important!< /text><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Whet down hill. Food is always missing an ingredient and last time my pad Thai noodles were BURNT AND HARD. Curry taste different (not in a good way) .... also could pazzaz up their salad that comes with lunch special. Dressing is good Thai tea delicious. Service is ok.< /text>

One of my favorite Thai restaurants in Downey. Been coming here for at least 21 years or more. Best authentic Thai food in Downey. My kids grew up on this cuisine. Love it!</review>

I would not vist his restaurant anymore. We ordened orange chichen there was barely chicken in it. It was just like a crispy fried bread. The seafood soup which is 15 dls had only 2 shrimp and two sticks of imitation crab.The kan pao beef was watery and it was not spicy at all as it says in the menu and the meat was hard. The papaya salad was 9 dls I think it was pricy it was very small our bill was for 90 dls for 4 people. I dont mind paying that when the food is good and when it has enough I ingredients😞😞😞😞< /Review>

I absolutely love the owners and the staff! It's a great restaurant and the food is very very good! really recomend the Thai tea with boba, orange chicken and baby corn plate with chicken! I've never had a problem with my food here! never too greasy or salty! This has to be my favorite Thai place.< /Text>

<Text>What is going on with this restaurant been coming for years and recently the quality of the food has gone down.  Ordered a wonton soup it was missing ingredients returned it and still was wrong. Service was very slow and very rude will not be going back again. Does not deserve a 1 star rating should be a ZERO.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>I don't like to give bad reviews. However; I know you're expecting an honest review. Anyway;  Zizzling Thai is the closest Thai restaurant to me for miles. So, Over the years I've overlooked a discrepancy here & there but this time it just went too far. I ordered a curry with fish because It's the ONLY meat I eat . they served me Chicken curry, so I sent it back. They thought I wouldn't notice that they brought me back the same curry in the same bowl with fish but failed to remove all the chicken 😜😝. BOOOOOO!
A total violation, disregard & disrespect for my beliefs and my health. They only want to sell you something warm. Not clean, not nutritious, not healthy or life supportive. Soooo Sorry! But I will NEVER return 😞.< /text>< pics>

Loads of veggie options! Its hard to find a place that can have almost every choice pf meat replaced with tofu or veggies. Portions are fair and food has a good flavor.</Review>

My friends and I were in town for a dance conference, and we loved our experience so much that we came back the next day for more. They have friendly service and amazing food, the quality of everything was fresh and tasty. We especially loved the vegetarian egg rolls, they had a crisp shell and came with delicious sweet&sour sauce. The Pad thai was also a huge hit, both vegetarian and chicken varieties. The thai iced tea was delicious as well. We were dying to try the fried ice cream but we were too full to manage! Definitely coming back next time we're in town.</review>

Okay restaurant with decent price. We used to go here often for lunch(close to work), but might not anymore since last Friday where there was a piece of chicken in my vegan order. I understand it might have been an accident but still don’t feel comfortable going here anymore.< /review>

<response>None< /response><Text>One of my favorite Thai places period. I think they just got a new chef, this place is soo much better Narai. Their Pa-nag extra spicy is delish' and the Spicy Basil Tofu and/or chicken is unbelievable. Nicer decor than before as well. I definitely recommend this place.

<text>I had ordered the chicken pad thai, garlic chicken wings, and thai iced tea. I loved the wings. It was nice and crispy. Portion was good. Pad thai was a bit plain from the pad thai I had elsewhere. Thai iced tea was ok but needs more of the tea taste than half and half. Overall I was full. Recommend getting the wings. The 4 star is given as the host/waitress was very nice and offered water as I waited for my order since I did take out.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<review>Tom yum goong too salty, at first they would load it with shrimp and mushrooms after a while it became less and less. Fried rice and noodles too greasy. After a few orders we decided to just drive all the way to panmivarn on Bellflower.  Food is great service is great enough said.</review></record>

<text>The staff and facilities at Public Storage are overall amazing. The staff is so kind and helpful and will support you in any way possible. When I was interested in renting a space, the staff was available to give me a tour of the property and showed me some of the units. The move-in process was so easy!! The online portal makes it convenient to set up payments. I called the front office and the manager made it a breeze to set up a unit. Can't recommend this place enough!</text><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1620228023843, 'text': "Hi Lynn, thank you for the recommendation.

<review>So i had a client who needed storage and this was closest by with a one month free promotion which is great. However at $45 a month for a small locker seems reasonable plus fees, and when i check out I’m left with a lock and key thats practically unusable again unless a rent this specific small locker. The rules and and regulations make this place a lot less customer friendly, from experiences in the past for example trading ID for dolly’s service and no trash cans for boxes or even at all on the premises can put an environmental friendly person such as my self at a crossroad. Fortunately good people and associates such as Annette made the experience a lot more enjoyable. They are flexible with late payments for at least 10 days i believe. Lot’s of stiff rules because of the customers in the past apparently, i prefer more friendly experiences. 5 stars for Anette 2 stats for Extra Space.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1620171982300, 'text': 'Hi 500KLA X.

<Text>Worst service ever. The elevator was not working and I was waiting for about an hour outside. When I went inside to ask they told me it wasn’t working and acted like they didn’t care. They told me to use the stair or to go home. They also increase the rent frequently.<//Text><response>{'time': 1600707622241, 'text': 'Hi Guzman213, thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us.

The very next day i received a call from a nice young lady from the storage. I was able to go in to see the unit. When my husband and I got their we where helped out by a very nice young man that helped us decide what unit was better for our needs.

The staff has always been so great and yeah, it was awful when the elevator was broken but it's been renovated for a while now and works really well. Place is clean, hours are as posted, security is great, billing has no hidden fees, and it was a great location with plenty of parking.< /text>< pictures>

The people were very helpful and kind. All precautions taken and even more. Also they recommended a space that was more cost efficient and convenient,  considering my situation.  I reserved online but am so glad I will be working with these people in my personal situation.  I would recommend them, highly.< /Text>

<text>This is a well maintained facility.  Parking with easy access to the freight elevator.  A personalized passcode for entry into the building and access your specific floor.  The only drawback to this place is there are a lot of homeless people that have taken up residence in front of the building.  I'm very weary of someone trying to gain entry into the facility while I'm inputting my passcode.  I had this happen to me a few times at Public Storage.</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

They offered me insurance when I got my storage unit and that was good because you never know who might steal in there and they also offered me a lock that’s good.
I recommend this place also try to understand them why am I saying this it’s because sometimes I go there and there is rude customers and I see that it’s not the employees fault that the customers don’t make their payments on time. A great place to storage your things.<//Review>< Pics>

Jackie was great ! We went there initially looking for a bigger unit but realized when we saw the space we didn't need as much space as we thought. She showed us a couple of the smaller units they had available and went with that. She didn't try and sell us more that we needed and she explained the whole process thoroughly. I also like the security of the place where you get your number and even when we were walking out to try our code and there was someone waking in she had them punch in their code even though the door was open.

Also we looked at rates around the area and this by far one of the best deals

Looking forward to having more a little extra space<//Text>

I got to Extra Space Storage at 7:57am and Jackie was immediately warm and helpful. I explained I had to be at work by 8:30am and if she could assist me swiftly. I hated having to put on that pressure but I really needed help. Jackie still had a smile on her face and was ready to help me. I knew roughly what size unit I needed and she immediately showed me what was available. She explained upgrades and downgrades of units and any specials they had available. I was done and paid by 8:10am and I didn’t feel like she rushed the process at all. She provided every detail of information I needed and made sure I was comfortable with the purchase! I did rush out of there quickly and I didn’t get a chance to thank her enough. If you’re reading this Jackie, you don’t know how much stress you have lifted off me with your help this morning!! Thank you very much and I’ll definitely be referring anyone I know to her!</Text>

Michelle, and Jaqueline were so helpful and sweet, both girls were. They made it super easy and quick for me to get the storage unit. No hidden fees or anything. They really do tell you what you’re paying on a monthly basis, and break it down for you. My experience couldn’t have been better 👍🏻🤗< /text>

Jeremy was very helpful. He made sure i got the storage i wanted. He explained things thoroughly and made it an easy process. He also took his time and i didn't feel rushed looking for the storage space i wanted. Paperwork was quick and easy, explained everything and answered any of my questions. Also cleaned up the storage unit, great customer service and a very friendly staff member. He also called to follow up regarding my appointment. So far Extra Space Storage has given me a great impression and is now definitely my go to place for storage.</review>

They have locks for sale and boxes and tape too!

JJ and Maria's exceptional service is why I was happy to refer a friend to use their service.  They are honest about their prices,  take the time to show you units, and discuss pricing options.  The storage is clean with a location,big enough access from your cars to access to unit. I have used many other facilities, consistent non aggressive service is peace of mind. Thanks guys.< /Review>

While helping one of my friends move, we both had a great experience with your assistant manager JJ. He is a great human being and has an exceptional outlook on life. Having people like this in business is vital, but seems to be harder and harder to find these days.  I’m sure he has changed the days of many individuals that visit any site he is working at. Thank you again JJ for going out of your way to to make our day better 🙏🏼< /Review>

This business provides great and excellent service as I stored some personal belongings of mines here. I had the opportunity to meet the staff that operates and manages this storage business. Jackie, Michelle and JJ are very friendly and welcoming and are always looking to assist you and provide a great service. I recommend this place of business to anyone looking to store their goods.<//Review>

Great storage facilities and easy move in. Staff were very friendly and helpful and storage unit appears safe and well-run. Only issue was hidden fees. I was quoted a price for the storage unit, but upon turning up I found out you need to pay a one-off admin fee of around $20, as well as a minimum required insurance of $14 per month. None of these were mentioned in multiple, advance conversations I had about the units, nor is it clear why a minimum insurance is required if you don't view your possessions to require it. Otherwise great place to store your stuff.</Review>

<Text>I could not be happier with the customer service provided by Maria. This storage facility is clean, and my first impression was it is very well run. I reserved my space on their website and received a phone call from Maria right away. All in all, very personable and friendly employees. When you are planning to visit a business often, this is something that makes a difference.The employees have been knowledgeable and accommodating. I highly recommend.< /Text>< Pictures>

I recently moved to the area from the east coast. Juan was super friendly and very personable. He did way more then what was expected of him. His customer service skills are off the meter. He made sure the unit was cleaned and ready for me to view upon arrival. I was very pleased. Would definitely rent and recommend them to anyone that asked.. Thank you very much Juan. You were awesome...<//Text>

Clean and safe. JJ is the best. He even pronounced my name right. Good carts. People do rounds. My dog had fun hanging out while I assessed my belongings. Four stars because I had no elevator for a few months while the new one was being installed.  8 floors up is a lot of stairs. There's always parking.</review>

I went in yesterday to pay for my new reserved storage unit and was in a bit of a hurry due to the fact that my friend who was kind enough to drive me there was already in a time crunch for a lunch he had to attend, but all that was wipedj away when  Jackie the young lady working did everything above our expectations, she was friendly, delightful knew all information we asked, she took us to see my space and she was such a joy even my friend didnt care so much about being a tad bit late for his lunch  if needs be, but the efficiency and thorough manner in which Jackie helped us was nothing more than impressive we were in and out of there in 20mins max, so not only did my friend make it on time to his lunch, but we left feeling happy and secure we made the right choice in a storage facility...I would recommend this location and dealing with Jackie to any close friends and family members..5 stars all the way, thnx extra space and jackie..< /Review>

<Text>Friendly and courteous from the moment I walked in and throughout the search process. Ms. Michelle was attentive and extremely understanding. I asked to see a variety of units. She took the time to help me find a space that I was comfortable with. Thank you Ms. Michelle for your help.

Extra Space Storage es el lugar para guardar esas cajitas que estan tomando espacio en su casita. Michelle me atendió muy bien. Mas que todo me tuvo mucha paciencia. Gracias por ser muy amable y profesional.

<Text>I was very impressed with the customer service and assistance I received at this location. Came here on short notice and the representatives at the front desk were very understanding and willing to help. They gave me 50% off for both 5x5  units for the first month and explained how the units are monitored 24/7 and are safe at all times. Every customer when they walk into the building are visually seen by the front desk reps during office hours and the units are all secured after working hours to ensure the safety of all of my assets. I love the transparency and the fact that I know that all of my items are secure at all times. The rep that helped me initially both times was Emrilda (may have misspelled her name) and she was fantastic. Will refer all my friends here and continue to do business here every chance I get!<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>I saycan’t enough good things about this office. And all of their locations. Michelle asked me the right questions, and helped me find a good deal on a space that fits my needs. And since moving into a locker, everyone I’ve dealt with is friendly, honest, and happy at their position. Which says a lot about the company itself. I switched to Extra Space from public storage after endless problems and misrepresentations. I was feeling really disgruntled, as public storage took advantage of me over and over, raising my rates significantly without any notice, and unreasonable added fees. Extra Space is the complete opposite. I highly recommend their service!</Review><rating>5< /rating>< Response>

<Review>Staff has always been great and really helpful.  But BEWARE after a couple of months of being there, the company raises the storage unit fee.  And then they keep raising every couple of months or so. If you have a budget you are working with - go down in that range when you start or you will definitely go over.  It's pretty sneaky, and bad business, but they got you in there and know it's a pain to move.  I moved my stuff out eventually because of it.  And I was explicit moving in that I had a budget range I had to adhere to in order to maintain a storage.</Review>< userid>

I searched all over LA for a storage space that would fit my needs, but Extra Space Storage on Pico was the only place that had the size I wanted for a great price!  The location was clean and well lit.  The actual storage space felt very secure.  The staff and assistant manager, Amaya M., were always courteous and ready to help with whatever I needed.  I will definitely go back to them with all my storage needs.</Review>

<text>JJ has restored my faith in humanity! I wish that this guy had been here for my entire tenure at Extra Space storage 2800 w pico. My husband and I were forced to move a mattress, boxspring, and bedframe our of our unit on an 102 degree hot-as-a-mother of a day! JJ was right there with cold cups of water, offering to help with the heavy lifting, and even expertly securing everything with rope to our pickup truck. The whole experience left me feeling so upbeat, I had to write a review! If only there were more caring, pleasant, and helpful men showing up like JJ did for us today, the world would be a better place.</text></record>

DO NOT RENT HERE!!!  They SUCK!!! The elevators have not worked for over a year which makes it very difficult to access your unit.  My unit is on the 5th floor and I can not do the stairs.  DO NOT RENT HERE!!!  And they keep raising the monthly rent!!!</Review>

Extra Space Storage has excellent service. I've been here since 1989 and that should tell you something.  Hermelinda has done a fantastic job in customer service and in keeping the patrons satisfied.  It goes without saying that customer service is rule #1 :)</text>

I want to leave a review for such a kind hearted staff named JJ for helping me out today. He was super friendly and helpful from the moment I walked in the door. I have visited many diffierent storage places and JJ made me feel so comfortable, safe and at ease. I would not go anywhere else to store my things now. I had such a rough morning and this gentleman made my day happier and exra special!< /Review>

This storage place was great! I went in with my grandmother because she needed to store some stuff due to an unexpected move. Even though my grandma rented just for about 2 months, we always had a great time when we would go to the storage. Raul and Hermelinda were always friendly and made us feel very welcome, my grandma and I always enjoyed talking them! We highly recommend this place! Great facility and Raul and Hermelinda will make your experience a great one!< /text>

<text>We utiized Extra Space on Pico for about 8 months, and had nothing but a great experience.  Amaya is who we usually dealt with and was very professional and just all around a very nice guy.  The rest of the staff are also very nice and helpful.  Beyond the staff, I'm very glad that we chose this location as it is conveniently located and I found the prices to be reasonable.

The only downside is that there is only one elevator so there can be a bit of a wait, though it never really impacted us too much.

I definitely recommend these guys, give them a call today!< /text><response>None<//response>< Date>

Our experience here was great! We were so overwhelmed with all the items we had to take out of the storage, but luckily one  of the gentlemen that worked there was kind enough to hep my mother and I bring down all the boxes and even helped us with some of the heavy stuff!!!! Thank You Amaya! I will definitely recommend Extra Space storage to my friends! The spaces are roomy and large! You definitely get your bang for your buck! ;)<//Review>

I had such a great experience here, Amaya was super duper helpful and pleasant to work with. I got a unit the day I walked in and it was perfect for storing my things for a month. Great for college students in the LA area! I go to UCLA and it took me 14 minutes to drive out here. I recommend using their services and if you can get help from Amaya!!< /text>

This place is great -- secure and spacious storage that easily accommodated my life's worth of furniture / various knick knacks. Lots of dollies and a huge elevator made load-in very easy. Jackie and JJ are awesome; JJ actually went so far as to deliver us ice cold water during the process, which was MUCH appreciated on a hot LA summer day. 5 stars, thanks for all your help!<//Review>

I had been putting off getting organized and was using my garage for storage because I thought it was going to be a big pain in rear to get a storage space. Usually I saw storage places to be dirty and unsafe. How wrong I was. Now having my storage unit here is great. From the moment I went into the office, it was a great experience and no hassle. Raul and Hermelinda have been a great help in getting me set up and all my questions answered. The facility is quite secure and I am very happy I finally decided to get organized.< /review>

We've been storing here now for a couple of years and the experience has been great.

- The location is close off the freeway (I-10) and is easy to get to.
- The facilities are clean and well maintained.
- The hallways and units are well lit and the access is very secure.

The team of people who work here are awesome.  The other day, we had to get our lock cut (lost key) and Bernadette was extremely helpful.  Although it was a tough round disk lock, she didn't give up and after 30 minutes, she was able to cut it off.

There are other Extra Space Storage locations throughout LA, but for the size and location, this one offers the best bang for your buck.  Similar units to ours, although they would be closer to where we live, are 35% to 45% more per month.

If you are looking for a storage unit central to Mid-City, Miracle Mile, USC or downtown, come down and talk to the gang at Extra-space Storage on Pico and Normandie.

Thanks!</text>

The positive reviews have to be fake! I've been renting here for about a year and a half and they haven't had a functioning elevator for months. There's a sign up saying that service has been stopped indefinitely. I think this place has 8 floors. Have a refrigerator you need to move to the 8th floor? In theory they have movers who will do it, but they're only available on certain days of the week and are always booked.  When I was here recently moving about 10 loads of stuff up to the 4th floor without assistance, a woman was screaming at the movers for taking too many breaks and wasting her time. Justified or not, I don't know, but I'll tell you what's not justified: removing elevator services and continuing to regularly up the rent without any consideration for the extreme inconvenience to customers. This place is a ridiculous scam. Stay away.< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I recently visited this storage space.  I attend the church across the street and figured I would drop by since I am in desperate need of space in my garage. It was already late in the day and did not think they would be able to assist me in the time frame.  I was greeted with a great smile by this young woman, I believe her name is Jackie.  She was AMAZING…even stayed late to make sure all my questions were answered – and by the way…I know I can ask too many questions…lol.  The area inside is clean, the exterior can be a bit intimidating due to all the men sleeping outside on the benches but once I was inside, I completely felt safe.  The storage is well enough space for the items I need to store.  The only downfall I would say is that the elevator is currently not working but what I was explained is that it’s something they are working on.  I would definitely recommend this location – there is parking onsite which is great because Pico and Normandie are really hectic during rush hour.  Definitely visit this place if you need to store items.< /review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
My girlfriend used this storage facility and I went with her to unload her stuff with her. The facility is clean, the security looks good, and the staff is very friendly. I see that there are several reviews here mentioning Hermalinda's name (one of the staff members) and I got the pleasure to meet her as well. I agree that she is an asset to the company.< /review>

I needed temporary storage of some household items, and Extra Space Storage offered the best value for my needs. Amaya helped me choose a storage space size that worked for me. Every time I arrived to access my space, Amaya and Raul greeted me enthusiastically and were always extremely helpful and accommodating. I only needed the space for a few months. But should I need storage in the future, I will not hesitate to reach out to Amaya at Extra Space Storage.</Text>

A diamond in the rough! I didnt initially expect the quality of service when i first walked into this building. Every single one of the staff was friendly and helpful. Always greeting us with a smile. Definitely was hesitant about using a self storage due to the fact that i've heard horror stories about it. But im glad i dont have any of those to tell.

If you need a place to store extra items, this is the place! :)<//text>

<Review>Came on a sunday wanted to store stuff on the 4th floor and you have to wait for an employee to operate the elevator, I was almost crushed when raul said he was gonna go on lunch. Which means no one would operate the elevator till 45 min. Later.  but he saw we had a lot stuff it would take us hours going up and down the stairs. So raul skipped his lunch like a trooper since he was the only one there and helped everyone there take thier stuff till closing.  what brassballs on this raul and he refused to take a tip. Best extra space employee there!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Text>hermelinda, veronica, and eric, the managers at this facility, are doing a great job. they helped me find exactly what I need and they make sure that the rules are enforced. this is an excellent facility, clean, well ventilated, and priced competitively.
the newest staff member cindy also gets 5 stars. I had big problems one day and she was very helfpul. Before the day was over she even found some cash I had dropped somewhere in the building, and returned it to me.< /Text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Very convenient, has parking the customer care is very good. They call every month before receiving a charge for late payments The place is always clean the ATTENTION is very good and the elevator is located towards the parking lot which makes everything easier and big enough to raise everything at once ... a bad point It is exceedingly expensive and if you must climb more than 3 floors you will need a lot of help or it will take you all day ... The schedules are short ...

(Original)
Muy comveniente, tiene parking la ATENCION al cliente es muy Buena.  Llaman cada mes antes De recibir un cargo por pagos tardes El Lugar este siempre limpio la ATENCION es muy Buena y El elevador esta localizado hacia El parking lo Cual hace ma's facil todo y suficientemente Grande para subirlo todo De una vez...un mal punto es execivamente caro y Si debes subir ma's de 3 pisos a necesitaras mucha ayuda o Te tomara todo El dia ...Los horarios son cortos...</Review>
