Wonderful co-working space. I've been a member here for many months. Very welcoming, clean and fun place to do serious work. You can book private rooms in advance, there are phone booths and lots of free coffee. Ed and Stephanie are great, and will answer all of your questions. Everyone is very friendly. Can't ask for more.< /text>

<review>Still not 100% sure on exactly the point of the place, but I think people can rent out certain rooms for a block of time if you need a place for a meeting or have a group and need to get stuff done whether it's computer coding, electronic engineers, producing music and whatever else they have going on! They also have some TVs with a PS4, GameCube and maybe other consoles if you need a break or just to chill from the work flow.</review>< Pics>

<Text>One of the most inspiring places i have ever visited!

Felt great here, I'm now motivated to start my own hacker dojo like place in INDIA where people can come in and use all the tools they would need to develop a product or a company!

Love it!

The facility is great for what it was designed for, a meeting place for tech-enthusiasts and entrepreneurs. It has medium-sized meeting rooms and a general area with tables and chairs for collaborating.  There are half-built robots and 3d printing projects scattered about (apparently there are 3d printers available to members onsite) making it an interesting place to visit for the techno-curious.  The acoustics in the meeting rooms however do not suit our music production meet-up needs well so we are looking for a new location.  But for less "musical" needs I can see the potential this place has for engineer types in this area.</Text><UserId.>112950293220263699997< /UserId.>< username>

The new space at 599 Fairchild in Mountain View is amazing- a great place to work/collaborate/hang out with amazing people with a lot of diverse technical talents. If you want interaction/energy you can find it there. Need some quiet space? You can find it there too. Well worth the monthly cost.< /review>

<Review>This is the is third incantation of the Hacker Dojo. I am a long time member. The oldest co working space in Silicon Valley, HD offers 24-hour access and many membership types, to suit students to coders alike. Group working spaces as well as dedicated desk. Awesome wifi.
Affordable and creative space. Try as a free Guest.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

I had a membership here for many years, but they have a new executive director mr Choudhry, he is absolutely crazy,  psycho and would randomly interrupts client meetings etc, big problem/trouble , as long as he is around DO NOT PAY for a membership. There are many other co working spaces where paid membership gets you a better environment.< /text>

Moved to Santa Clara. This place changed management and principles a long time ago. I left in 2015 when it was still in Mountain View. Still a pretty decent bargain price for a coworking space - as long as the new location works for you.</text>

<review>Great place to study or hangout with friends.  It is a shared workspace with several various sized rooms.  Machinery, such as 3D printers, may also be shared.  Membership is not required to use the space, but it is recommended.  Guests may only stay until 10 PM unless they are with a member.  Events may be held with membership.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

A few changes for the better to make the Dojo a special place.

This is a communal working space for creative people. I don't really know how else to describe it. It looks like the majority of the users are software developers, but I was also told there are photographers, web designers, businessman, etc. There's a suggested donation of $10 to visit and work at the area. Monthly membership is $100 and it comes with plenty of benefits like faster internet connection, access to workshops and happy hours, 24 hours access (visitors need to leave by 10 PM) and many more.

It's a good alternative for those that need a change in workshop, or just to meet other creative people with same (or different?) interest. I've visited the facility twice for a workshop and office hour, and it looks like I will be coming back more often for other reasons.</Text>

<review>Very cool and productive workspace but extremely upset about the internet connection! Paid for a month and was promised 45 mbps. However, they block all speed-test websites and it takes me over 3 minutes to upload a 20MB file which makes me question their speeds.  As dramatic as this all sounds, it does slow down my work quite a bit.<//review>< Pictures>

<Resp>{'time': 1450378890968, 'text': 'We\'re very sorry you had this bad experience. It happened that you came during our annual holiday party, the one three-hour window a year when we close down the Dojo to celebrate with members. Tours are free during business hours and a "day pass" to use the facilities all day with our 250mbps Internet is only a few bucks. Full membership is $195/mo. We\'d love for you to come back again to check it out.'}<//Resp><pictures>None</pictures><Date>1450318710701<//Date><text>I wanted to check out the space (at what I thought was a free event (no mention of a fee in the description)), but after driving half an hour away, was told (by a receptionist that rolled her eyes constantly when I was speaking to her) that I had to pay 40 dollars to get into the event. I was displeased, but I asked if I could at least look around. The receptionist then proceeded to say no, "because there is food and beverage out", as if I was just going to run in and stuff my face and run out. Needless to say, there is no way in hell that I am going to come back to this place.<//text><Rate>1</Rate>< name>

It sure is exciting to have this humongous new space. Instead of having the "repurposed warehouse" look (although it was repurposed nicely) this has the "I once housed startups" feel which is sooo much more appropriate for a Silicon valley hang-out space.

I do think it needs to be filled with more people/stuff, though. Hear that people? Fill it!< /Text>

DON'T PAY CASH HERE!!! I love this place, but just don't do cash. I tried to pay $23 for the day use fee to get $15 in change, but the guy a, didn't want to do it because it was too complicated, and b, gave me $10 in ones. So, just pay with a card.<//review>

< Review>
Really nice facility, well maintained and friendly staff, great value. The gym has plenty of options of machines and free weights. The bathrooms/showers and locker rooms are pretty decent and clean. They have a basketball court and tennis available as well. The pool is about olympic size I believe, and always clean. But I mainly used the jacuzzi, which is great for relaxing in after a workout. And pretty much everyone I met there were friendly and down to earth, unlike other gyms where they are just about showing off how huge or ripped they could get. There are also personal trainers available. For the price, you can't beat it...highly recommend this place.<//Review>

<text>La Sexy Michelada you are most certainly fantastic, I had a wonderful experience here yesterday. Wonderful menu items, friendly staff, lovely mood - what more could you ask for? Every item I have tried was so fresh and delicious. The service is amazing. I just wish I lived closer so I could be a regular at La Sexy Michelada.< /text>< Pictures>

Great experience! From service to the food I have no complaints. Prices were fair as well because this place is definitely not shy with the amount of food you get. We all left fully satisfied. Will definitely visit again.< /Review>

Best mariscos in the city of Fontana! Right on Locust and Arrow. So fresh and tasty. The micheladas are the best in town! The shrimp governador tacos are the best! Shrimp tacos with cheese and a kick to them. I love it all here! Service is awesome always.</Review>

Only had a michelada and it was very tasty. Their chamoy mix on the rim of your mug is perfect for the beer. I will be back</review>

I really recommend this place!! I try their lobster tail with Ciro style shrimp on top with an amazing crab salad. They also offer trays of ceviche and other delicious food items. You will not regret coming here!! Great service, Great food and can't go wrong with great cold beer or a delicious michelada!!!</Text>

Good food. Awesome service. The atmosphere is good here when it's packed. They have a variety of food items. Seafood selection is good. I got the aquachile, which was real good, one of the best I've had. And I got the chicken plate which was ok. But they're forte is seafood. They have a variety of different type of micheladas. Beer selection is good as well. New owners and new selection. Waitresses cute and helpful, family run, which is a plus in my book. Stop by, give it a try.< /text>

Thanks to yelp, came across this local gem late night and they did not disappoint. The fish tacos and shrimp taco were the freshest and best tasting ive had in a while. I thought I would either have to go to san diego or la near the beaches to find good seafood tacos, nope this place right here in the I.E. delivers. Great music, good service and the place was spacious and clean. I will definitely be back< /Text>

Amazing food and the owner is exceptional. You can tell he really cares about his patron's experience. Has the Tacos Estillo Guerrero which were fantastic. My friends ordered various other plates which were all delicious. If you want baja/mexican style seafood then you must try this place. Only gripe would be the bathrooms were not too clean. But overall 5 stars.<//review>

If you're craving a michelada go here!!! They are bomb!!! Fish tacos were spicy and satisfying! Staff was attentive and friendly. Will definitely come back to try the other things on the menu!🙂< /Text>

I just had a Michelada with a friend & it was delicious. The server routinely checked on us to make sure we were doing fine & if we needed anything. The atmosphere was cool & relaxing. Looks like they do karaoke on certain nights. I oughttta come through sometime & check out the music, the food, and a different Michelada.<//text>

Food is always delicious and there's chips and salsa while you wait! Spacious area, music, and flat screen tvs throughout mostly on sports channels. They have beer, micheladas, and mimosas. Friendly & inviting environment as owner comes out to greet everyone and the waitresses are courteous throughout. Great family environment and bar style option</Review>

<Review>Customer service was great! All the girls were so nice. They had music playing on a big speaker and one of the girls asked us what we wanted to listen to. Just a simple way to make us feel at home :) This place overall was great! I will be back for sure. I had the “coqueta michelada” and it was amazing!< /Review>< Pics>

<text>I ordered chicken and avocado dish but the chicken was old and had a foul taste, also it is a Mexican restaurant where they had 'ran out of ' avocado. Not sure how that happened with only 2 families dining there at the time. But what's worst is that they braught 2 slices of avocado after I was already practically done eating my meal.  The picture on their menu showed at least a half avocado if not a full one so seeing those sad 2 slices of avocado after I had already finished my meal was just insult to injur. I wouldve much rather not got those 2 slices and settled with the fact that they had ran out and maybe gotten a discount on my tab. Now 4 hours after the meal I cant freaking leave the restroom which on the bright side, gave me some time to write this review... only reason for 2 star is that the staff was actually nice so maybe they were just having a very bad day good wise</text>< pics>

This place is awesome!  We went there Saturday night at the suggestion of a friend who was raving about it.  We had their Shrimp Micheladas, the Tacos Estilo Guerrero, and the Camarones a la Diabla. The Micheladas were beautiful and tasted amazing! The quality of the food really sets the place apart from  local competitors.  It is definitely top-notch and beyond the norm. I was surprised to find food this delicious, service this great, and an atmosphere so fun right here in our own little neighborhood!  Our waitress, Diana, really brought the whole thing together with a friendly, welcoming manner that made us instantly feel right-at-home.  This is definitely my new favorite spot for first class Mexican Cuisine!  I can’t wait to work my way through the many other dishes on their menu!< /review>

My wife and I adore this place. First visit was amazing. Everything is made in house, even the michelada mix and the chamoy. I was glad we came in on a weekend because they had some amazing carnitas. We can't wait to go back and bring the rest of the family.</Review>

<username>Ms. Borrayo< /username>< Review>
A low-key place that needs to be discovered! I got a shrimp cocktail that was delicious. My fiance got aguachile and he really enjoyed it! But the michelada! I'm pregnant, so I can't drink but i took a small sip to try it, and it was just so good! He got the guerrerrience. It's big michelada with shrimp. Def. a place that we will be recommending and coming to more often. The servers were really nice as well. A well ran place!< /Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The food is very rich, I have to accept that the palate is the one that commands the chips with the very rich sauce. I recommend it a family restaurant and good service by the waitresses and all the staff.

Edit: Added today's visit! A+++
I absolutely love this place! I used to eat at the one in Downtown LA on 7th and flower, but since the pandemic I haven't been down there. Then I found this location, Which is less than a mile from my house! I have been to this location at random three times in a row, in the past couple of months, and I absolutely love it! Not only is the food fresh and delicious, I always receive the best in service! , the gal at the front was so kind, i even showed her a trick to using chopsticks! It is so nice to see people enjoying their jobs..and working with people!!! ..I needed the human interaction! A++++

I wish I could give La Marque 10 Stars! I went in there during a slow period of the day, so he not only took my order he, after washing his hands, and visibly putting on gloves, prepared my food! The store was very clean.
I feel safe eating here, after seeing La Marques example of covid-19 training and food service.
And the food... I got a tofu plate with avocado and brown rice, and it was perfect!< /text>

I ordered one beef bowl all rice with avocado. I ordered on half n half with veggies and no avocado. Somehow I ended up with TWO half and half bowls, one with no veggies and avocado, and one with veggies and no avocado. Went back to get my order fixed, they wanted to retake my bowls and simply shift things around. Gave me extra veggies and avocado, but went home and found the wrong meat in them. How does someone mess up an order that bad? Ridiculous. Tried calling and of course the line is busy so I can't speak to a manager....<//text>

One of the first ones this morning and not knowing Jeremy had me waiting a usual amount of time which I expect. But all I saw was some light lollygagging going on once I got up and approached the counter to observe one of the ladies began to make my bowl and asked what I was having inside. This is a total inconvenience hands down. Its cliche in so many levels. I did not even got an apology even after I caught them redhanded not taking my order seriously. I worked at a couple fast food restaurants and once customers orders came out from the kitchen they come out. Im so upset coming here.< /review>

My husband and I have gone here several times and bought tools, a stereo receiver and a few other things and have never had a problem with any of it. The staff is really nice the store is clean and the manager Amanda goes above and beyond for her customers. Plus they have great deals.. We will continue to shop here when we come to town.< /Review>

Great place, very customer service oriented. Fast and friendly!  They don't judge you 'why' you are there, if that's a concern.  Also, great deals on everything from tools to musical instrument, guns and of course, jewelry.</Review>

<text>As far as Customer Service; the staff that I dealt with, was friendly and polite. As far as the store as a whole; they really shouldn't call themselves a "pawn" shop. It should be more of a "Gold & Silver exchange", their bottom line is to make fast cash and they don't want to deal with the small stuff nor do they want to have to wait for something to sell. They don't deal with any sort of "collectable" items. Example: A U.S Ment coin that is worth say $100, (as far as the U.S Ment is concered), but this store will only give you the value that the silver per ounce is at, as melted down silver. Which is penny's. There is only a bottom line to them and they won't give you a cent more. They have so many rules on what they are willing to buy/pawn that they shouldnt do it. On everything that they buy from you, they take 75% of the value. My advise; If you're needing a couple bucks, make sure that what you bring in, is of great value. If you're looking to buy something from then, know that they have; bikes, tools, TV 's and jewelry..and be sure to bring a few hundred at the least with you. I hope this helps out someone.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><user_id>112387761432223677000</user_id><rate>2< /rate><Gmap_id>0x809cb4317a0c38ef:0xb3a8a8986271113b</Gmap_id><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

{'time': 1508431425182, 'text': "We are so sorry to hear that you were disappointed with your visit to our store! Our customers' opinions matter to us very much, and we always hope our customers leave happy and satisfied.\n\nGold buying is a complicated mathematical process, the first step of which is determining the purity of a piece. In your case, if your ring tested at 6k, that means that the ring was roughly 25% gold. At today's spot price, this would mean that full spot value of a ring that size would be less than $150. Put in these terms, I hope our offer doesn't seem so terrible after all!\n\nThat said, our reputation in the community is more valuable to us than gold. We are deeply committed to remaining Northern California's number one destination for the sale of precious metals. We hope that, given the chance, we can prove ourselves to you as the fair and honest business that we strive to be. Your input is an important part of our process, so thank you for taking the time to leave a review!"}<//response>

Was wondering what they would offer for a 14.8g 10k ring after some testing they said it was closer to 6k maybe 8k?  I know Jostens got so big by stamping thier gold a higher karet..... anyways offer was 100 or about 40% of scrap value what a joke hope people will go elsewhere and not get so ripped off.<//Text>

Fabulous customer service I can't stress how much I appreciate the honesty they first check the tire to see if it can be repaired instead of purchasing a new one , so you can save yourself some money.  Other shops would have just sold you a new tire.  For those Spanish speakers.  Son muy honestos y francamente no lo roban y le dan muy buen servicio.  Great customer service 👏</review>

<text>Personally I'd rather Support our own & run Family Businesses any day, over some "big" chain store. An this is exactly what this Tire Shop represents! They have great service, an were quick in the time it took to do the job. The other point that was great with them was even tho they quoted 1 price to me an had to change it, they took the time to explaine why & show me what was going on. I personally thought that I got great service there & will be returning there for any other tire needs. Oh yeah, & P.S. Although there waiting area is tiny, they were very Welcoming to my service dog, I Loved that! Thank you all for your help, an great service God bless, Kristen</text><Rate>5<//Rate><Response>None<//Response><UserId.>117651159853661672739</UserId.><Gmap_id>0x80dcd909077137ab:0x1059646fc72dc74</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Alex Fronczak was a client who came to our tire shop and bought 2 tires. We explained to him our warranty on used tires, so if he has some problems with our products in two weeks (tires) we can replace or fix it at no cost. However, Alex said he went to another tire shop to fix a valve. Then two days later he return to us with a rude attitude asking for us to pay a bill of the service he got in another tire shop. We kindly explained to him that in order to fulfill our warranty policy; our customers should contact us, so we fix the problem if it is related to the work we did.

Great service,  fair price, HONEST. Dismounted my tire, did a patch.  Removed the spare donut,  installed my wheel after repair,  put the spare back in the trunk after servicing.  Checked all tire pressures and reset the TPS. 15.00$$</Text>

Decided to stop here during our very short visit to Needles. It was one of the best food experiences I've had on this weekish long road trip we (myself and best friend) have been on. This is a place you should go if you really want to unplug and get out of your bubble.

It is a small shop, with all meals cooked by the owner. I recommend this place to anyone not in a rush. It was a great time chatting up the owner; learning the history of the place and how she got there as I ate green curry with Chicken and my friend ate the pad Thai with Chicken. The pad Thai was cleaned off the plate and the green curry had some leftover but because I had two helpings of rice and it was a giant serving.

This owner absolutely loved what she does and loves meeting people from all over. This place gets 5 stars not only because of the food quality and taste, it was the full welcoming experience of it all. I felt like we were brought into her home and culture like we were her neighbors. I will not be forgetting that.

We were the only ones in there so it was especially nice to get the full attention. I'm sure it gets hectic with multiple customers but if you know what you are getting into, you can appreciate and have the patience. She cooks (sometimes her husband does as well) all the meals without help.

(I have a picture/video or two on my actual camera which hopefully I will add at a later time; at this time only have pictures of the pad Thai).< /Review>

I walked in and saw how filthy the dining room floor was and had to walk back out. I understand that Covid has foot traffic down but a simple vacuum would be a good thing.< /review>

<Text>This little thai food shop in the middle of no where is the most hole in the wall shop i have ever seen. There is only one lady who does every thing and she is the best.

“One” is a very sweet and friendly Thai woman that cooked our orders fresh and served us. She’s a one woman show and she conversed with us like a friendly Thai grandmother. She’ll first meticulously ask you how spicy you would like your order. Don’t let the run down nature of the restaurant fool you to think negatively. We came in the evening around 6:30. The appetizer plate of Rangoons, battered shrimp and vegetable egg rolls were all hot and fresh, served with a sweet Thai garlic dipping sauce and also with homemade Chinese mustard. I ordered a mild Chicken Pad Thai that was fresh and tasty. My wife ordered sweet and sour chicken. She wished it had more flavor, but I sampled some and found it to be just right in taste. If you’re not in a hurry and just want to relax and have a nice Thai grandmother serve you a great home cooked meal, this is the place for you.< /text>

I've walked in twice to this place only to be completely ignored..... 1st time went and the lady was cooking so I figured I'd grab a menu to see what I wanted after about 10 mins I stood a the register to order. The lady seen me never greeted me and continued cooking. After about 15 more minutes of standing there... I left. So I thought I'd give it another try and again was completely ignored..... apparently my money is not good enough for her. And I would have given her zero stars but unfortunately I had to give 1.</review>

Terrible service. Just disrespectful... may be the best chinese food restaurants from here to the coast but they refused to take an in-person order, then when my dad called them from the parking lot they didn't answer.  When he called them from their lobby they looked as stupid as their service is. Liars are bad business.</text>

Pretty good place to eat. I would recommend calling ahead, as you may have to wait. U should  also call , and ask if they have egg rolls sometimes they are sold out. Chicken fried right rice is pretty good, so is the Kung Pao Chicken.< /text>

2 nights in a row we tried to order food to go and she said it would be better if I go someplace else to eat. This is pretty sad, all the business that are hurting for money and she pushes us away. Never will I try Cooks Cuisine in Needles, Ca.<//Text>

Dont let the ambiance fool you, i have to admit we were on the verge of leaving when we entered the place. But we stayed and enjoyed wonderful and delicious curry. The lady seemed hard at first, but conversation soon opened up and she was really nice and interested. If we're visiting Needles again, i will definately keep this diamond in the rough  in mind.</Text>

One of my all time favorites. I grew up eating at Cook's and insist on going there every time I visit. The green and yellow curries, chicken and rice soup, and pad Thai are on point. You can sub tofu for meat in most dishes, so it's also the best vegetarian option in Needles. #vegetarianfriendly</Review>

We were very disappointed after reading such great reviews of this restaurant. First, the place was dirty. But it was the food that put us off. The egg rolls were good. But the curry was tasteless, maybe she forgot to add the curry. The shrimp in the shrimp with veggies were undercooked and the sauce tasted like just soy sauce, no garlic or any other spices. Definitely would never return.<//Text>

The food is DELICIOUS. The best Pad Thai I've ever had. The owners are very friendly and helpful, and the prices are really reasonable for how much food you get.< /Review>

<text>Wow. I was not expecting that meal walking into this place. The food is phenomenal. The owner is very friendly and loves to chat. If I could have given it a 6 star rating for the wonton soup, I would have. If you ever find yourself in Needles, this is the place to eat.</text>< rate>

We don’t eat, so can not comment on the food. We walked in on a Sunday evening at 6:30ish, only 2 people in side, the lady cooking didn’t acknowledge us as we stood at the cash register until the phone rang. She came over and answered it. Took the order and we ask to order and told her we wanted the dinner number 2 for 2 special and was told that she wasn’t cooking anymore of it tonight but we could order off menu and turned to walk away not waiting for our order.
The other customer had the ‘I cannot believe what just happened look’ on her face.
How much effort would saying ‘hey, have a seat I will be with you in a minute’ or something would have taken?
We left and went to the wagon wheel to eat dinner.
Maybe locals tolerate such behavior but shouldn’t in my opinion.<//Text>

Although a small establishment, the food and service were excellent. I ordered the pad thai to go, which was made on the spot, and the staff was very friendly and polite. My take away order had a big serving of my order, as well as plates, utensils, napkins, fortune cookies, and a box of rice, all for no extra charge. The pad thai was one of the best I've ever had. If I'm ever in the area again I'll definitely be going back.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) While visiting Needles, this restaurant was advised by a local with whom we spoke at the hotel. We were very well received and the boss made us the dishes ordered it was divine! Very good Thai food for more than reasonable prices. An address at the top

(Translated by Google) It lacks enough cleaning, especially in the bathrooms, since it is better not to enter. But surprisingly, the food was delicious. The owner is very nice and nice.

Le falta bastante limpieza, sobretodo en los baños, ya que es mejor no entrar. Pero sorprendentemente, la comida estaba riquísima. La dueña es muy simpática y agradable.<//text>

<Text>Janina Martinez is an excellent tax professional. She explains everything in detail as she is going along and makes sure I get the biggest refund. Janina is friendly and also has perfect customer service skills. I felt extremely comfortable asking her questions because she had an answer to everything I asked. She also mentioned the refund advance and perks of the emerald card. She is very resourceful! Thank you Janina!<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Everyone was so friendly and efficient. Claudia was extraordinary. She was so knowledgeable and patient with me as we sorted through all of our documents, and answered all of my questions.  She will be the reason we return to H&R Block year after year.< /Text>

<Text>Their service was horrible, we went for one simple gender reveal balloon they said it would be 20 minutes and we were there an hour and it popped right when we stepped out  and took forever to see if I’d get a refund.  Never again will I come into this place.< /Text>< name>

<text>Food is pretty standard for a KFC... If they could actually get your order correct. Who forgets 8 pieces of a 16 piece order?

At the very least, they are quick to rectify their mistakes.< /text>< Rating>

The only problem with this place is how insecure they are about their drive-thru time. 9/10 times you will be parked up front and will have to wait. I understand why they do this, but I can assure the staff that while it may be stress inducing, orders would be a lot more efficient keeping people in line. Plus I'd rather wait 15 minutes in a long line, then wait 5-10 minutes out front because I thought it was empty. Putting cars out front only allows more cars to add to the work load.</Text>

I've been to this KFC about 3 times now. I would say this is by far the worst KFC branch that I have ever been to. They never have the chicken that you're trying to order-the lady running the drive thru is hard of hearing. I don't recommend coming here, save yourself the trouble and just go to Popeyes which is located right down the street.< /text>

Everything is wrong with this place. I ordered through the app and it still took 45 minutes. It wasn't even busy. I have no idea what the employees are doing but it's definitely not their jobs.<//Text>

The WORST Customer Service Ever!
Food was TERRIBLE! Colonial Chicken Sandwich was so Greasy that the buns were soggy and Orange from the Grease my French fries were cold. I had to ask for my Drink and the kid acted like I was troubling him! I will NEVER Return to this place! I'd rather drive 20 miles outta my way than to eat here!</Text>

<text>After a nice summer afternoon my family decided to re-live through the nostalgia filled trips we used to take to KFC back when it was a half-competent restaurant. We walk in and as I guessed there was no line as returning customers are a rarity at this establishment. We ordered a combo for each of us, 5 pieces of chicken in each. But when we opened the bag at home I was shocked to my CORE. Not only was each combo only 3 pieces, one was straight up missing. This was the scam of the century - giving those who remember the great, tender, finger-licking good dreams of the Colonel hope to taste the beautiful golden brown crust - and then ultimately crushing those same dreams within the reveal of the orders contents. I’m not mad, but I’m an emotional wreck as a result of the trip.</text><response>None</response><gmapID>0x808ff8c77d83878d:0xcedb0e93d728ec24</gmapID><Time>1563931314196</Time><Rating>1<//Rating>< UserId.>

<text>Don’t go to the KFC in Brentwood, every time I go there something is wrong.  Kids managing kids.  Today was the frosting on the cake.  Ordered a 4 piece meal combo, was told out of chicken would be 25 mins.  Or they could give me 4 legs. I asked to talk to the manager.  The manager if she really was a manager no tag was another kid with a disc in her tongue. I told her I did not want to pay $10.99 for 4 legs. She said she would charge me $6.99 for 4 legs.  Drove out  opened the box and two small legs and very little wedges.  I worked for KFC all thru high school I’m now 65 never remembering such poor service.  The KFC on Deer Valley is always good!</text><time>1579226261124</time><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

Drove up to the window and they worked said "they were closed" and I said, "no your not online says 1030" worker said "no that's a mistake"  so I said "my wife is pregnant and, the worker said that's not their problem". Never got my order right in the past anyways. Lost yet another customer< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Food was good. Something to I form the customers is wait times. I didn't realize it was going to be 10 minutes. So I went back through the drive thru to find out they gave my food to someone else. I am not an online basher. So. I gave 5 stars. But keep in mind when going. Longer than normal wait times for this place< /text>< Name>

< review>
Tonight i experience a horrid display of customer service and store management that i may have ever seen so far in life. Tonight at a KFC off Lone Tree Way ran into a bit of a snag serving customers. The service of food seem beyond slow. Customers came back with food in hand due to mistakes in their order. Doors were locked to keep customers and complaints outside while vividly trying to ignore. Young man and women appear to be left alone to do their best and operate a fast food chain they didnt seem prepare for the task and with no management to be found nor aid in fixing the problem. I witness a young man set up to fail as his registers according to him lack the proper change to give back proper refunds to angry patrons who had no other choice but to leave a few dollars richer due to the lack of change. I had to witness a young man panick in the face of the customers who were right to be upset yet some of the blame should go to the management! I still feel sorry to this gentleman as it seem like he barely had help nor a chance this night to be successful.....he was doom to fail by whoever running the show at this restaurant or whoever is in charge of the store all the way up to a District Manager. I hope others from this night that was disappoint with the results will speak out as something at this location needs to change or just call it quits and shut the doors for good.</review>

Twice we've gone here around 6pm, most recently yesterday.  When ordering I was told they were out of white meat chicken.  They only had thighs left.  Not sure how this happens at a place that has chicken in their name.

I've never been able to eat from this location, but after seeing the other reviews about the inside cleanliness, I am glad they run out of chicken and couldn't complete my order.

Never again will I try this store.  Employees were not even apologetic about it, I'm sure they love it and just slack off for the last 4 hours of work each night.

The owner should fire everyone, including the manager for letting this go on.</Text>

If I could give it 0 stars I would. Doors were locked at 515pm, ordered food to eat in was given bags, when asked for plates was given trays, waitee 25 minutes for food after watching drive thru people just flow through, staff had attitude when asked for spork.</Review>

<text>I ordered a BIG BOX 3 piece all thighs original with mashed potatoes.  I also ordered a Polar M&M swirl.  The chicken was burned, and not seasoned... the mashed potatoes were cold and I didn’t even get the Polar Swirl, that’s OK KFC, you got me.   Hope you enjoyed my $19.58 because I will NEVER go back to KFC, looks like it’s Popeye’s for me from now on.</text><Gmap_id>0x808ff8c77d83878d:0xcedb0e93d728ec24</Gmap_id><username>George Garcia</username><Resp>None</Resp><pictures>None< /pictures>< UserId.>

I actually tried the A&W double cheeseburger. It was horrible. Cheap meat, only available with mustard /ketchup, no pickles or onions. No flavor on the meat, just a cheap cut of beef. I practically gagged when I took a bite.< /Text>

<text>This is my second or third time I decide to stop to get something to eat at this place, I waite over then 5 minutes for somebody come and ask me if I need help, then when finally somebody come first question was if I planning to pay cash or credit card I believe because they have no change available, after I start to placing my order they informed me they have only crispy as my option, I agree to give a try but after they take my order they come and informed me again they only have wings and brest, come on what kind of business is that. Please if you can't offer a good customer service and at least 90% of your menu as available. Please close it down your fast food restaurant.<//text>< Gmap_id>

If you ever plan on eating chicken.......in your lifetime, avoid Oakley & Brentwood locations. (Same owner) They seriously never ever have chicken cooked and ready to be purchased. You are asked to wait 20 minutes - every time. No joke.<//Text>

My food was fine but the service is really slow and unorganized.

Just heard an employee saying "what's burning?"

Someone was waiting for 5 minutes when I walked in.

Another customer has been waiting 5 minutes.

They were more concerned about the receipt paper than giving me my drink when I didn't care about the receipt. It took 2 people to figure out the receipt paper installation.

Otherwise it seems fine but I expect better.<//Review>

I took my fam there to beat the heat by getting an assortment of large floats, and was told that they had all flavors, so I wanted the orange dream flvrd, no orange soda, and no Dr. Pepper,  & I don't like Pepsi, Rootbeer,  or Coke, ended up with a Pepsi mixed w/Rootbeer😟🤯🤯my grandson mom  ended up with a Pepsi float, my grandson changed his mind after all the confusion, he's only 6yrs old, and my son wanted water only, and they wanted to charge for the cup as if you're buying a soda, so he was livid!, he'll probly write a poem about it!😂😂 so beware when the cashiers tell you, We have all flavors!😟💆‍♀️🤷‍♀️ It's not always true...<//review>

<review>Without a doubt the worst service of any KFC I've visited. EVERY employee on their cell phone and trying to stay out of view. Had to call out for someone to help. As soon as they finally take your order, they disappear from the counter and are back on the cell. I asked the cashier if they were allowed to be on their phones while working and she couldn't answer me. We have made multiple visits hoping the service was just a fluke, but it is their normal service. Will not go back.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

This location is the worst that I've ever been in.  The staff didn't know the menu and they didn't have any chicken ready.  The place was empty except for the one customer in the place who was waiting for his food and warned me of the wait. I had to wait 20 minutes for my food. Popeyes is down the street and they always have food ready.< /text>

Chicken was cold👎 under cook had to wait 30 minuets for food the place was dirty bath room was not kept up to “Helath standards” what so ever EWWW don’t get me started on the
—->customer service was god afoul

Oh and they cut you on food so always make sure you get the right amount of food 😂 cuz trust me that’s just what they do here take your business to another location just NOT HERE

Sad part is I love KFC and have been a customer sense my first time when my grandpa took me to get my first pice of chicken 🍗😭.

Please KFC headquarters do a surprise inspection and see what I mean 👀.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Last time I come here... Been here about three times, every time they're out of condiments or out of whatever, then they tell you wait out front for 5 minutes but usually takes 15 to actually be ready... Just tell me 15... Why you got to lie?</Review>

Wanted Mac n cheese with my fill up and they gave me mashed potatoes and proceeded to say they were out of mac n cheese. Then they gsve us 2 stale biscuits because they where out of cookies.

<Name>Kelly McEnry</Name><Review>Never have chicken!!! I mean never! Corporate dosent care apparently.  I've Bennett there 5 times and was served chicken once. It was only dark meat available.  The other times there was no chicken available!?!! After complaining to the manager on 2 occasions; his response was that it was the busy time and I could wait 30 minutes. People at the drive thru were not pre-warned. They were forced to wait in their cars until they reached the intercom.
KFC is a good fast food place, however, this 1 is by far the worst!
Go to the one located on brentwood blvd. Just out side of lone tree way and get chicken everytime!< /Review><resp>None< /resp></record>

Took someone 5 minutes to take my order on drive thru. To top it off I was stuck in their drive thru line for 20 minutes!!! Once I got to the window they didn't even know what i ordered. Management needs to step up their game. Ridiculous.</text>

There was only one person working the counter and he seemed very unorganized. He kept leaving and when he came back with other people's orders, he took his time coming back to the register to take my order (and I was the only person in line at the time). It took almost 15 minutes to get just an order of fries and cheese curds.< /review>

I got my conch pierced by Salome and honestly the experience was so much better than I expected. Salome was super chill, I was pretty nervous so she made me feel really comfortable. She was really knowledgeable about like aftercare and healing periods of course. Most importantly, it looks amazing!! Oh and Covid protocol was 💯👍🏼 Highly recommend, thank you! 💯< /Review>

Indy did a wonderful tattoo on my finger. The lines are crisp and clean. The environment was very friendly but definitely paid close attention to COVID guideline. I will be a returning customer.< /text>

I went with 2 of my closest friends and to do a last memory since one is moving here to SF and we are from Santa Ana. We decided to get matching helix ear piercing and the service was PERFECT and memorable. Salome explained everything to us and had such an amazing vibe. I totally recommend this place. In love with my piercing ♥️🥺🌉</Review>

<Review>I got my ears pierced tonight by Salome and was very pleased with the outcome! She helped me create a custom ear piercing placement of 5 piercings. The jewelry selection was affordable, and the shop was clean and socially distanced.
I highly recommend them!</Review></record>

I went in to get two piercings on my ear and replace some jewelry. Christian did my piercing and he was awesome. I am pretty squirmy and he was really helpful in making me feel comfortable. The piercing was done before I knew it! I LOVE my new jewelry and overall am very happy with my experience.</Text>

Today I went in for my first piercings ever! Everything about my experience was a positive one from the minute I walked in till the moment my ears were done and we were leaving. I highly recommend Salome wether it be your first peircing or looking for a new piercer - she’s your gall!< /Review>

I had wonderful experience at Mission Tattoo and Piercing. The staff was kind and welcoming, the space was beautiful, eclectic, and incredibly comfortable, and Indy took my idea and turned it into a lovely work of art.</Text>

I’ve been wanting a rook & belly piercing for so long and Salomé did her thing! She is amazing, if you are thinking of getting pierced, go to her! She made me feel so comfortable & at ease. So fun to talk to as well. It’s very clean & they have hand sanitizer on deck.</text>

I happened to stop by and they had time for some piercings! Super cool people working there and I loved the art work vibe. Most important it was safe, (temperature checks, sanitizing, spaced out, ventilated) and the work was great! I’ll probably be back for more this week.</review>

I got my nipples pierced by Christian. He made me feel so comfortable instantly! The shop was very clean and he was very professional. It wasn’t as painful as I thought it would be. I highly recommend this shop and if you know what’s good for you ask for Christian! His energy is amazing and will put you at ease 😊< /review>

I scheduled an appointment the day of and they took me in. The front desk didn’t seem to be interested in working and had a little attitude. My artist was Guilherme he was very welcoming and gave me the right tricks and tips for my first tattoo. I would 10/10 recommend the shop and forever come back for more tattoos.< /Text>

Today was my first tattoo. I was nervous and scared to go in, but the tattoo artist Indy was very calming and through her words calmed me down with her stories about when she got her first tattoo. I came in the tattoo shop thinking that the process getting my first tattoo was going to be painful, but it wasn’t. I barely felt any pain. I believe that is because I have a high pain tolerance, but everyone is different. The tattoo came out AMAZING and I would definitely recommend Mission Ink Tattoo & Piercing and Indy to an individual who is considering getting a tattoo. Well done!< /review>

She worked with me ahead of time and subtly updated the design I wanted to make it a better tattoo, while maintaining fidelity to the original artwork. She made me feel comfortable and continually checked in with me to see if I needed a break while we were working (it was an inner bicep tattoo; fingers tend to get tingly after a while).

And Mission Ink is a great studio! Awesomely decorated, clean and comfortable place. All of the staff I saw and interacted with were friendly and helpful. 10/10 would get inked here again 🤘< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOidtjmHyxkf-zxrU1YBeRW1NeBZttJJ3tutuiJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808f7e3c1d7eb721:0x687ea3a2a2bcb10f<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I have been following her on Instagram for awhile and she had a last minute cancellation so I got in two days later. I emailed her some ideas, she was very responsive and made some little tweaks and added a moth (love moths!).<//review>

I never leave reviews online but felt like G deserved that I do. G was awesome throughout the whole experience. Super friendly dude. I had a complete design change the day of my appointment, and he did not complain at all. We sat down and looked at designs online together, he drew it up and 20 minutes later got to work. Ended up with the coolest angel tattoo on my back. Couldn’t be happier with it. Would highly recommend G. And his price really can’t be beat.<//Review>

First time getting my earlobes pierced here. It was a great experience having to work with Christian for the day. He's well informed about the piercing procedure and makes sure to keep you relaxed as your ears get pierced. Great place for first timers and at an affordable cost!<//text>

The second we walked in we were warmly greeted and had a wonderful conversation with the staff as we waited for our appointment.

Amanda was our artist. She is amazingly talented & I am so glad we got the chance to work with her. Definitely visiting her creative mind again next time we are in the San Francisco Area! I wish we could find someone like her near home!<//Text>< Pictures>

What a rad shop! I have been getting tattooed often for about 7 years and they are definitely my personal favorite.If you are looking for anything traditional Matt Howse is hands down the best around, I have several tattoos from him and plan to get several more.I've also been tattooed several times by Jeff Croci, best biomech you will find and does a lot more badass work too.Can't go wrong at this shop, even though I have never been personally tattooed by Luke Stewart or any of the other artists, I know they are all great as well!!! Now go get tattooed! :)< /text>

First time getting ears pierced! Everyone was really nice and the experience was cool. There were no complications and it was really quick because there was no line. It's walk ins only and cash only so remember to bring cash. Pretty cheap compared to other places. People there were really professional and it I could definitely tell they knew what they were doing.<//Review>

Got two black minimalist tattoos (J initial and rose) by Guilherme and was very impressed. He’s a really nice guy, professional, makes you feel comfortable and overall a great artist.  Pricing is also fair, studio is clean and very relaxing atmosphere.  I’ll definitely be back!<//review>

These guys are awesome! My friends and I came in as walk-ins for 3 tattoos and 1 piercing and Guilherme mocked up three awesome tattoos based on our descriptions and got us all in in about three hours! Christian pierced my friend's conch and we agreed that he was the friendliest, most professional piercer we'd been to.

Would definitely recommend, thinking of going back for more extensive work!< /Review>

My cousin and I both got tatts from Guilherme and we had the best experience, it happened right before all the lockdowns, so I'm grateful I got a chance to get mine done.. He's a true artist and is incredibly professional. He definitely knows how to work with your idea and add his personal touch to the piece. I love my tattoo more everyday and will definitely get another one to celebrate the end of the pandemic one day.<//Review>

My husband and I saw Amanda. It was his first tattoo and my second by her. She is so great! She’ll take your idea and improve upon it with her ideas to get you a great tattoo. Her lines and shading are both incredible, I have no complaints. And she always makes sure you’re comfortable and are doing okay. I can’t recommend her enough. I don’t have experience with anyone else in the shop but they were all friendly.</Text>

Amanda did an incredible job on my tattoo! She was very friendly and professional, and was super invested in creating a piece that I would love. She had amazing bedside manner and it was the most pleasant tattooing experience I've had to date! It's been about two months since I got my tattoo and it's healed up perfectly. No need for a touch up or anything, the ink held perfectly. Definitely will come back to her for future pieces. The rest of the staff at Mission Ink were also super friendly and helpful.</review>

This place felt lucky, artsy, and body positive! Haight Ash Tattoo said they shouldn’t give me a belly button piercing bc of ‘roundness’, but here Christian showed no hesitation and was super sweet. And it looks adorable and centered on my tummy. It was $30 pierce and I got the $40 jewelry, though they had some $30 jewelry too. Cheapest I found around SF. No wait and took maybe 10 minutes. Remember to ask about after care!<//review>

<Text>Service is super nice! Guilherme Assumpção is very very passionate about tattoo (don't drink coffee just because his precision is perfect for tattoo -- dedication guys), great service, communication is on top, great person and kind soul! He made a tattoo on my ankle with which I'm very happy!

Besides that he fixed my old tattoo with which I wasn't truly happy for a year and wanted a touch up, he basically made a second tattoo with no charge ( is a small one)

Thank you very much!<//Text>< gmap_id>

Amanda was fantastic! She was very patient with my friend and I, as it was our first tattoo and we were both rather nervous and picky with fonts etc. She made sure to incorporate the aspects we wanted while also making sure that the tattoo would be legible over time. The environment was comfortable and overall it was a lovely experience!<//text>

<review>Great and funny staff - very engaging group and really care about providing quality service. Amanda was so amazing - I sent a photo of calligraphy and she sized and placed perfectly. All the little details. It was my first and will likely come back for more!</review>< user_name>

<Date>1497333856290</Date><Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Amanda did an amazing job with my first tattoo!  I am still in the healing process as I just recently added this lovely flower lady to my life (and my ribcage), but I love her so much already! Considering it was my first tattoo experience, I was fairly nervous about everything, from reaching out and to, later, the actual process (I heard plenty of stories of pain), but Amanda was compassionate, kind, and warm, which relieved any anxieties. I am so happy I found Amanda and definitely plan on reaching back out to her at Mission Ink when I'm ready for the next! All of the staff I encountered were welcoming and inviting. The location was beautiful, comfy, and clean. I know there are some reviews with concerns about the surrounding area, but even though I, myself, am usually and understandably weary of walking around cities alone, I had no problem parking in the nearby garage and walking to Mission Ink with a sense of safety on my own (for anyone with any similar or related concerns).

All-in-all, what a great experience, truly deserving of all 5 stars and an honest review (I usually don't review places, generally speaking). Thanks, again, Amanda!<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNnDrw_aCevdsePQnRWfYQ8U_2dTf8kTJE29xy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808f7e3c1d7eb721:0x687ea3a2a2bcb10f</gmapID></record>

Got my septum done by the lovely Sashablue. She made me feel comfortable throughout the whole process and told me everything I needed to know about aftercare. I was concerned about a bump and sent her e-mail to which she responded right away- that's a piercer who cares. :) I definitely recommend getting your piercings done at Mission Ink. Thanks, Sasha!!</Review>

<text>Amazing service! From the reception to the instructions on how to look after your tattoo during the healing process and everything in between. Everyone is super nice.
I had my tattoo done by the incredible Amanda who is the sweetest ever and super talented. The precision of the fine line of my infinity symbol is impeccable. I had the best experience anyone could hope for when having a tattoo. Worthy every dollar.<//text>< Pics>

<text>My best friend and I were in town visiting and decided to finally get a tattoo together. G was our artist and he was amazing! This was my first one and he was very patient with me.  He is VERY clean and made sure everything was sanitized. Heck, he wouldn't even let me touch a paper towel that had my own blood on it. G is very knowledgeable and our design came out crisp. It has been 3 weeks and it looks great! I highly recommend him. Everyone on the shop is super cool and welcoming!<//text>< pictures>

< Review>
Friendly staff, relaxed atmosphere, talented artists. it's a cozy space that does a lot with what it has. I've gotten 2 tattoos there from 2 different artists. The first one actually remembered me and said hi when I was getting my second, which I thought was sweet. One thing I find odd is that if you take an Uber there, the driver's GPS always tells them that Mission Ink is on the opposite side of the road than it actually is, so getting picked up and dropped off means taking a 2 minute walk to the nearest crosswalk and half a block to location. No idea why it's so consistent. That has nothing to do with the tattoo place, of course. It's more of a side note.<//Review>

Mission Ink is the best, and Bruno is the man! My husband and I have both gotten tattooed by him (multiple full-day sessions), and we could not be happier with his work 😊 He was super willing to work with us and put up with all our feedback and nit-picking with a smile, while also giving us his professional artistic opinion to ensure we got the best design possible. Everyone at the shop is so nice, friendly, helpful, and welcoming! I’ve gotten pierced there as well, and we’ve brought/sent in multiple family members and friends for both piercings and tattoos. I can’t recommend this place enough for all your body beautification needs in the Bay Area (and beyond!). We’ll definitely be going back soon 😉<//text>

My mom and I went to get our noses pierced here after seeing the other awesome reviews! Sasha helped us out and made sure that we picked the right jewelry for us, and then took us back one at a time. She made us feel really comfortable during the entire process.

I got a basic ring for ~$50 and my mom got a small sparkly stud for ~$80.

They are healing up nicely! Check them out for sure if you're in the area.<//review>

I love my tattoo from mission ink. After reaching out to them over email, they invited me in that weekend to create the design. I was luck enough to get to work with Amanda and she created a piece of art for me in a very timely manner. The whole staff is fun to work with and I would highly recommend this place for someone with any level of tattoo experience. You won't regret it.<//Text>

<Text>Came to see Bruno for my first tattoo after a recommendation from two friends.  There was a 6 month wait for an appointment but definitely worth it.  Bruno worked with me on the design as well and I'm glad I changed the size/placement based on his expertise.  Love my new tattoo and it looks identical to the photo I showed him.  Bruno is an amazing artist and I will definitely be going back to him for another tattoo in the future.</Text>< Pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>GREAT PEOPLE, GREAT WORK, GREAT PRICES!! For a while I have wanted a compass on the inside of my wrist as my first tattoo. I live in NYC and went to a place my friends recommended and was told what I wanted was too small, wouldn't work and the people were generally very unhelpful. So being in SF for a few months I decided to see about getting it done here. I researched Yelp for tattoo places and all the reviews for Mission Ink were really positive. I first met Andrew a fellow Brit at the front desk and chatted with him for a bit and he introduced me to Bruno. They were both really engaged, took time to understand what I wanted and then made suggestions on the design I wanted. I went back a week later and Bruno showed me the mock up. We worked on it to revise it and he was patient and nothing was too problematic to do or change. I am a bit of a perfectionist but he is too so it worked. The guys were amazing. The tattoo took about 45 minutes and I ABSOLUTELY could not be happier. It is a really beautiful piece of work. This place rocks!! if you intend or are just thinking about getting a tattoo done you have to go here. Great people, great work, great prices.< /Review>< Resp>

I got my first tattoo here and they were so nice and even when I was scared the tattoo artist was so calm and helped me relax, I actually choose to get my second one here as well and again they were really rad. I had her design the tattoo off of an idea and it is perfect. Seriously a great shop and I would highly recommend! First timers will feel comfortable and already inked folks will find an artist to fit there style as well.<//review>

<text>Just got my first tattoo with Bruno and i couldn't have been happier with entire process. I scheduled my appointment a few months ago and i had to call in and change the date and they were very accommodating. Bruno checking in with me a few days prior to the appointment. During the actual appointment he explained everything he was going and made me feel at ease. I am definitely coming back!! thank you Bruno</text>< Pictures>

<Review>I was a little nervous as I walked in (last minute nerves) but the staff was very reassuring and professional. They clearly established the prices, techniques and sanitation methods and answered all of my questions without losing patience. The prices are very reasonable-- definitely the best I found in the city, especially considering the quality of my experience. I would recommend this to any of my friends and I will go back when I want a new piercing/tattoo.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><user>102445181824446509331</user><Rating>5</Rating>< response>

This place is awesome! Everyone in the shop was super friendly and very knowledgeable about their craft. While I was going over paperwork my fiance ended up getting a piercing (nose) and it looks fantastic! In regards to my tattoo, I set up an appointment with G and damn this guy is good. He spoke with me over the design I brought in to make sure I had everything perfetcly how I wanted it. The tattoo itself was so quick and painless (for a tattoo) I was amazed. I am in love with my new art, and will definitely be coming back for more.</Review>

<Text>Mission Ink was great. Great place, great people, great work. I got my tattoo as part of a birthday present to myself. When my wife saw it she made an appointment and went in and got a tattoo that she had been contemplating for a while and our friend Greg say that and made an appointment for the next day and got a tattoo that he had been wanting for a long time. Three tattoos, three artists, all great! Thanks Bruno, Nick and Dawn!< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>Mission Ink Tattoo is great! I messaged them in regards to getting a tattoo a day before (I am from Southern California and was only in town for a day and loved their work) so they told me to come in right when they opened to meet with G. Unfortunately, traffic was a lot worse then I expected so I was late so I called and they told me not to worry but to come around 5 so I did and G told me what he could do and the price it would be. The tattoo came out AMAZING and the price was pretty fair! I will definitely be trying to come back for my next tattoo here!<//Review><name>Kiernan Holt<//name>< pics>

<review>Anji took really good care of me, going the extra mile when my septum piercing came out a bit crooked by offering to upgrade my jewellery or redo the piercing for free. She even slipped in a free bottle of saline solution for aftercare. She obviously cared about doing a great job and felt badly about the mistake, and took measures to fix it to make sure I was happy. I really appreciated how she went the extra mile to make my experience good, despite any setbacks.</review>< Pics>

<Review>Angie was sweet and walked us through every step of the piercing process. Since we were walk-ins, we waited about 30 minutes before it was our turn. We didn't mind since we needed time to pick out our earrings anyway. Their selection isn't huge, but the prices are reasonable.

For my titanium surgical grade earring plus piercing cost, it came out to be $72 plus tip.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Went in for a second lobe piercing. Sasha was great. She took the time to answer my questions — before, during, and after the procedure. The whole thing cost a bit more than I expected (~$225), but I'm pleased with the results nonetheless.<//review>

Everyone that we spoke to at this place was extremely nice. My tattoo was done by G, and it was exactly what I wanted! G is very sweet and very friendly and understanding. He was very open to any ideas I had and he made sure that my tattoo was exactly the way I wanted it. He even made the effort to reposition the stencil when he noticed it was a little off center.<//text>

Tomac has given me both the most painful and relaxing tattoos in my life(separate experiences). He is an amazing coach through the painful moments and an incredibly skilled artist throughout all parts of the process. After getting tattooed from all the shops in town (and up and down the west coast) this is really the only business I could recommend from BC to Tijuana.< /text>

My boyfriend and I came into Mission Ink to get our dernals done at it was the best experience we've had in a long time. Our piercer (<<hope that's a word) was Sasha and she was so sweet and such a cool chick to be pierced by. I was a tad nervous when it was my turn because my boyfriend had already had a dermal in the spot we both chose. So this was going to be a whole new feel for me haha. Thankfully, Sasha took my mind off of it. We had great conversation and so many good laughs. I highly recommend that if you're planning on your next piercing to come to her. Thanks again Sasha! 🖤< /Text>

Amanda is so welcoming and easy to work with! I walked into their shop after passing by during the SF anti-Trump rally/march. This was my first protest, and after experiencing the peace, love and unity that ran deep, I wanted to commemorate this somehow so I never forget. Since I'm also new the area, it's difficult to find a good tattoo artist to work with, and Amanda is great. I will definitely be back again. And remember, we are all together and we have to unify against hate.<//text>

I wanted to get a tattoo that represents my love of San Francisco. Bruno delivered!!!!
During my last trip to the city I love. I started to research tattoo shops and hands down, 5 stars on 3 different on-line platforms. Mission Ink was always at the top and they had the most reviews. So it was set. That's where I was going. I then read and looked at the portfolios of the artists and decided on Bruno. Then I walked in and was pleasantly surprised that Bruno had a cancellation!!!! Lucky me. I am so happy with the tattoo!!!< /review>

I called a couple days after my initial meet up, after setting up an appointment, I needed to change the time of the appointment due to work. They were nice enough, with due time, to change it and inform me that G, my tattoo artist,  had a previous appointment that day and I should arrive early just to give them time to check me in . I arrived on a Mon afternoon and the parlor was buzzing with people. G was still working on another client, but said hello when  for about an hour before he saw me but the front lady, something starting with an L,  informed me every so often of G's progress and even offered me cookies and water while I waited. I even spoke with Travis, one of the staff member who does piercings, for 20 min while he was on break and had a great conversation while waiting. Once Will was free, he spoke with me again about my tattoo, he was concerned and patient with my requests. We decided after a little discussion about the size and style, how the tattoo should look like, then went to work!!! I let the front desk lady know that I had a friend coming in later to hang out while I got tattooed which was fine with the staff. G, my friend, and I hung out for about 2 hours talking and joking while I was face down on my stomach, just chillin. All in all, my experience was phenomenal. I got great service and they were great at communicating what was happening. G was a super great dude, the front desk, and staff were genuine and calm. I would highly recommend this place and G specifically. I'm planning on going back to get additional work done by Will himself.  For a first timer, you want to feel like there's no stress and a good energy when walking in. This business has friendly, knowledgeable, experienced, and licensed staff that know what there doing. If your looking for a new spot, first timer, or simple just want to get a tattoo in the spur of the moment, I would recommend...

<Text>I recently had a piece done by Bruno at Mission Ink and am super in love. I walked in and came with several photos pulled from the internet, explained the small details i loved from each photo, and then hoped it didn't sound like a mess. He interpreted it perfectly and sent me the piece the day before my appointment so I could have some input on it. My piece was reasonably priced, the shop is clean, the staff and artists are all nice, and the comments i hear most often about my piece are how beautiful it is and how well it was done. I don't know that this correlates completely but this piece has also healed much faster and better than my other tattoos from different shops.

After a little bit of research I decided this was where I wanted to go to get something done while I was in San Francisco for the day. I'm from out of town so I was a little worried about going somewhere completely random but the guys in the shop were super friendly and talkative and made me feel comfortable. I'm really happy with what Nick did for me and would definitely recommend Mission Ink to anyone in the Bay Area!</review>

My wife and I walked in for piercings, a nose stud for her and a tongue stud for me. Anji came up and helped us pick out matching opal jewelry and told us she'd rip us new ones. We said OK and not long after, had that jewelry in our faces. Great experience, quick and mostly painless.< /review>

I came here for my first ear piercing and the experience was wonderful. I came with a friend and her friend recommended this place, saying it has a reputation for being of good quality and hospitality. I met Andrew who told me to do some paper beforehand, took my ID for verification. After paying $35 in total for piercing and a black stud, I waited for a while until Sasha told me to come in. Sasha was very friendly and nice. It really helps when she talks to me and make me feel comfortable and less nervous. She did it quick and it stings a little. Everything was great and now my  looks great!< /review>

I went here today to get my septum pierced by Sasha Blue!

Aaaaand turns out my nose wasn't made for a septum piercing. I don't have a "sweet spot" for the needle to go through without piercing cartilage.

Sasha explained how she prefers not to do septum piercings through cartilage, because of the extended healing time and issues it can cause. I really respected the fact that she stood her ground when she felt a piercing there wouldn't be worth it.

She did, however, suggest a nostril piercing, and I agreed that it would be a good alternative.

Sasha was professional, used clean tools, her and the other employee there (whose name I sadly didn't catch) were friendly, and she helped me find the piercing that worked for me when what I came for wouldn't be the best choice.

I definitely recommend Sasha Blue at Mission Ink for piercings! :)< /review>

<Text>Coming from France to get a tattoo, I was looking for a not so expensive place. I did found it, and I must say my tattoo is much more beautiful than I could have ever expected it to be. Guilherme did a wonderful job, advising on the artwork I chose, without any pressure and listening on my ideas. The session happened in a cool mood at the studio, everyone being so nice and kind. Great place I would recommand to all of my friends ! Thanks again folks !< /Text>< pics>

I got a tragus piercing by Sasha while I was visiting and I love it. Everyone at the shop was really friendly and answered my questions. It had been a few years since I've had a piercing but Sasha was really sweet and reminded me of the process. I walked from the BART station a few blocks away and I think it took me less than 10 mins to walk. FYI the Mission District is nothing like the fancy Embarcadero area. The Mission District is a little more...ummm...rough. But every big city will have nice areas and not so nice areas. CASH ONLY. There is an ATM at the shop and there are a few banks really close by if you want to avoid ATM fees.< /text>

I got my FIRST piercing here 3 days ago. It was lovely.

My friend who I was visiting in SF brought me here when she heard enough of me saying that I'd wanted to get a septum piercing for years. We walked in and were welcomed calmly and I felt like the guys (Andrew and Hugo, if I remember correctly) knew their stuff. Andrew chatted with me in my nervous excitement as I filled out paperwork and Hugo stuck me calmly not long thereafter.

I felt safe, felt like the staff were knowledgeable, felt that the facilities and equipment were clean.

ALSO! I came in the next day and asked about cleaning and adjustment and Sasha helped me out. Sasha. Is. The. Bomb.

I would definitely recommend Mission Inc to a friend and would totally consider heading there if I chose to have any more piercing/tattoo work done :)</Text>

A symptom of SF reviews by SF-ers tend to over-use the word "best". However, this shop truly is the best. Yes, indeed, trust me.

I worked with Bruno over a few weeks for my 2nd ink but first high commitment one taking up the better part of my upper right arm - and it is so beautiful. Anything said about his technique would be an understatement - he's gentle, detailed, understanding, focused, and most of all a truly talented artist. I'm honored to sport this work of art for all eternity. :)<//Text>

<Review>I waited 20 years to get this particular tattoo and decided to do it today. I searched every tattoo artist and settled on Guilherme. I emailed for an appointment and also sent the picture of the tattoo I wanted. Arrived at my appointment time. G had to modify the tattoo size for it to be placed where I wanted it. He did an excellent job!  Gave me Exactly what I wanted. Couldn't be happier.  He was nice, felt at home and he was quick. Listened well to what I wanted and made it work. Will definnately go back to him.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<text>Guilherme was INCREDIBLE! Already had a sketch drawn up for me after I sent him a few images and a small description of what I wanted. I got three California poppies on my forearm with a slightly geometric style. He listened to what I wanted adjusted to his original sketch and did a wonderful job. Not only was he incredibly talented but also such a sweet guy with wonderful conversation skills and knowledge. Definitely recommend this place and Guilherme!!
Ps. Andrew (front desk) had a great sense of humor and was super helpful in scheduling and overall attitude.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Text>I chose to go to Mission Ink because of all the rave reviews and 5 star ratings about the staff.  I guess my expectations were raised a bit too high and I expected a different experience.  The shop itself is what you'd expect of a cute eclectic tattoo/piercing place and the staff are nice, and enjoyable enough.   This was my first experience getting a tattoo and many of the google reviews specifically mentioned coming here for their first and how comfortable and supportive the staff was for them.  I didn't feel that way.  I should have walked out and chosen another shop.  Don't get me wrong, I'm satisfied with my tattoo.  But the experience of my first tattoo could have been better.  I felt very little support and at times I felt as if the staff and artist were annoyed with my inexperience or that I came in not knowing what I could do with what I wanted.  I feel a true professional artist should expect education to always be part of the deal when it's someone's first time.  I didn't possess the knowledge or experience to know what was or what was not possible but I felt as though they expected that I should.  Also as a first timer, you dream big.  You have no reference point other than what you are hoping for and there's meaning in what you are doing.  I think many first timers choose something for their first tattoo that's meaningful and I feel the artist should understand that if you take that away by saying it's not possible, the person needs some acceptance time that they're not getting what they dreamed.  I felt like I was rushed to accept my memorial would need to be reduced dramatically and quite frankly that the artist was a bit perturbed by my sadness from the realization I couldn't get what I wanted.  It wasn't so much the fact that I couldn't get what I had hoped for or wanted, but it was the way with which that message was delivered and the insensitivity of the staff regarding the issue added to the rushed feeling to decide.  I should have walked out and found a more supportive place so that my first EXPERIENCE would have been better...because the actual tattoo itself ended up being simple enough I could have gotten it anywhere.< /Text>< pics>

I've done piercings several other places, but this was my worst experience. The piercer made me feel uncomfortable about my other piercings and how they had healed (done at a shop across the street). They decided to change the gage of one of my piercings after getting the jewelry through which led to the most painful I've ever felt getting any of my many piercings. She left a short post in my tragus that was barely long enough for an uninflamed ear, so it was very hard to heal the swelling as it pinched and was hard to clean. Would not recommend this shop for piercings< /Review>

Guillerme was a wonderful tattoo artist, he made sure I was comfortable and worked with me on sizing and position as well as talking it over with me until I felt sure about my tattoo. The process was quick and he was very fun to talk to!

Aftercare instructions were clear and the tattoo came out beautifully.

I guess the only thing was that when I emailed them to make the appointment I asked them if there was a way to get in touch with Guillerme beforehand and they said I could only come at 12(when they open) and talk to him before any other appointment.

I didnt have time to do that and it ended up being a non-issue because my friends made the design, but I still think they should set up an email so talk to the artists before any appointments.

Guillerme ended up giving me his email in case I had any aftercare questions, so I’m not sure why they couldnt give me his email beforehand—he even asked if I had sent anything when I came in for my appointment!

Other than that small thing I had a wonderful experience!

Thank you!!!< /text>

I'm from southern CA and made many inquiries for tattoo's.  I read many positives reviews.  Andrew was polite and helpful on the phone as I was super nervouse to book a tattoo session.  The place is clean, unique and employee's are friendly.  Guilherme (tattoo artist) was over the top gentle and put me at ease.  Prices are reasonable.  I will be back in the future!< /Text>< Name>
