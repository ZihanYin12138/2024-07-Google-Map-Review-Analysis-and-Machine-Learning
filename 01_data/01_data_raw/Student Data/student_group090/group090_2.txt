We were hoping for a positive experience in working with Seller’s Advantage and we definitely received it. The staff was always professional. Everything was completed in timely fashion, and our expectations of convenience and a low-stress closing were realized. We would definitely recommend. With my approval, they were able to close on the sale a few days early and our proceeds were wired to us immediately. Big thanks to the entire Seller’s Advantage staff!<//text>

Loved that when we 1st met their rep, he was very professional and took all the time needed to answer all of our questions about the process. They were very patient with us while we looked for our new home, and when we were ready to finally sell, they had the highest offer. They made the entire process very easy and smooth. Throughout the whole process there was always someone who would answer their phone to help along the way. The best part was they allow you to leave the trash you have and they dispose of it, they pay all closing costs and our money was received literally within 24 hours. Sellers Advantage made this whole process simple and smooth. I would highly recommend if you are looking to sell quickly without going the traditional route of a realtor. Allow them to simplify the process, you won't regret it!
Thank you Sellers Advantage for how awesome you guys are! We had the best experience and if ever need to sell a house again, we won't hesitate to call!!< /Review>

My first call to SellersAdvatange went great and I was impressed and thrilled with their service and professionalism. Every step went exactly how they said it would go and we closed escrow and had our money within 10 days of our first phone call. Russ came out and looked at our home and made us an immediate all cash offer, which we accepted. Within an hour, Melissa called and the process had begun. My wife and I would definitely use them again and highly recommend them to anyone selling their home.< /review>

We could not me more impressed with Seller’s Advantage.   We contacted them about their services as we were looking to sell our residence along with our mother’s home.   Our home was in turn-key condition, but our mother’s home needed a lot of work but was in a good area.  They told us immediately that our house would not be a good option as their business was buying homes that needed work and reselling them.   However, our mothers house was a potential possibility.   They saw our mothers house and we negotiated a deal.  The pricing was very fair and reasonable.   The process was very simple, and they were very flexible with our mother’s timing needs.   Their contract and paperwork are very simple and the transaction could not have gone smother.  Basically, you ask for an offer, they look at the house, then make you an offer.  Take the offer or not.  No high pressure, not complications, it was very simple and, again, in our case, the price was fair given the cost to rehab and sell the home, we sold it without any hassle.    (As an attorney having delt with real estate for years their process is simple, transparent and I had no worries or concerns.  We had an extended closing date and when that approached my mother was ready to move early and we requested an earlier closing, no problem, it was done as requested.   The house sold and we got the agreed amount.   All-in-all I would highly recommend them.<//Text>

We had a distressed property that was costing us money. Seller's Advantage almost seemed too good to be true. I just knew it was going to be a big waste of my time but guess what? Not only did they make us the best offer everything from start to finish was a breeze. The staff was professional, patient and responsive.
I would recommend them to anyone.  Sellers Advantage made this whole process simple and smooth. I would highly recommend them if you are looking to sell quickly without going the traditional route of a realtor. Allow them to simplify your life, you won't regret it!</review>

Damon was very awesome to work with and was not pressuring in any way whatsoever.  Also, took the time to really engage in the property value and neighborhood.  Granted, like any other Seller you look to find the top dollar but at the same time our family home was in great deal of TLC.  We as a family were happy with the offer and that is when Melissa stepped in as well to complete the 7day close... also a delight to work with.  Both representatives had great communication, very satisfied with the outcome.</Review>

Our experience with Sellers Advantage was a positive one. I met with Russ at our home we wanted to sell and after viewing the property he made us a thoughtful and fair offer which we accepted. The process from there was smooth and painless. Working with Melissa in the office was great and she always kept us informed as to what was going on and what was coming next. Both Russ and Melissa were very kind, considerate and professional. We were promised no closing costs and a 14 day closing and they kept that promise. I would definitely use Sellers Advantage again and recommend them to others.< /review>

<text>My husband and I had a home to sell that needed some work. We didn't have the money or the time to fix it up. We had never used Sellers Advantage before and thought we would give it a try. During the transaction we worked with Russ and Melissa from Seller's. Our first visit with Russ at the house was positive and encouraging. Russ made us an offer and we accepted. It was a fair offer to purchase our home at an agreed price "As Is" with no repair costs to us including zero closing costs. From there both Russ and Melissa handled the whole process from beginning to end with professionalism. Both Russ and Melissa were friendly, considerate and easy to work with.

My dad was ill and my parents needed to move quickly. Russ and the Seller's Advantage team were fair and decent. They came and offered a reasonable price for the house, and they worked with my parents to ensure that their needs were met while making their transition to their new home. I was very impressed with how accommodating they were. If you need to sell quickly, the folks at Seller's Advantage are a great way to go.< /text>

Need to sell my parents house so why not see what they would give me.  Did my research.  Agreed on a price within 2 days.  Title cleared 10 days later.  Check in hand 2 days after that.  Had a couple of problems on my side and they helped me through the process.  Very Polite and Professional Organization.  Would Highly recommend.</Text>

From the start of the process, working with Damon to secure a fair offer was easy and quick. The entire SA staff was professional and communicative. Melissa was on top of every detail and stayed in constant contact during the process.  They worked with us on an extended 60 day escrow to facilitate the work we needed to coordinate exiting the home as well. Highly recommended for a stress free home sale.<//review>

The Seller's Advantage team was prompt, professional, patient and most of all genuinely kind to my family during this process of selling our parents' home. From start to finish, the process was transparent and made as hassle-free as possible for my family. We had multiple offers from iBuyers, independent real estate companies, and private parties; and ultimately Sellers Advantage was the direction we went, and with zero regrets when it was all said and done. Thanks you Sellers Advantage team, for taking great care of our family and making this such a great experience.</Text>

<Time>1604519362831</Time><review>I worked with Troy Lines at Sellers Advantage. Unfortunately for me, his lack of proper communication and misrepresentations caused me to lose out on time and money. I hired a home inspector during escrow after Troy already was informed by the seller that the tenant did not wish to vacate the home and actually wanted to buy it himself! This company has no accountability for the conduct of its associates and I don’t recommend working with this company based upon my experience on this transaction.< /review></record></dataset><record>

They were everything they said they were.  Quick, easy, and we got a good quote within 24 hours. We had to sell my mom's house, but due to the virus, we couldn't finish cleaning.  They took care of all of that.  Best decision we ever made. We received our money right away and closed before our deadline.<//review>

Seller's Advantage did an exceptional job in making the selling of my family's home Effortless. I recently had to sell my Family home to assist in my fathers needs with assisted living expenses. I requested a quote and they immediately responded. I received other quotes from other buyers and they exceed the competition. Through out the process they were extremely helpful answer questions and assisting with all needs of the selling process making my part effortless. When i had finished removing my fathers personal property I contacted them and the quickly completed escrow an relieved my concerns. Thank you to Troy, Brett and Mellisa for all your great work.

I was buying a house out of state and in the middle of the process the lender imposed a condition requiring me to sell my current house prior to close of escrow on my new purchase which was scheduled to close in about 3 1/2 weeks. I called Seller's Advantage ; they came out on the same day ; sale contract with closing date of 3 weeks was signed the same day. They subsequently returned all calls promptly answering all questions and kept every promise made. As a result i was able to close as scheduled on my new home.
If you need to sell your home fast as is, i highly recommend Seller"s Advantage</Review>

<Review>I am the executor/trustee of an estate the included the home in which the decedent, a hoarder, had not lived for seven years.  In addition to all the junk,  there was substantial deferred maintenance.  I intended to go the conventional route and make repairs before selling through a realtor.  However, as I began to obtain bids on the work to be done, I was often told that because of the condition costs could be higher as unobservable defects became revealed.  Sellers Advantage came by to inspect the house the day after being called and made an offer the following day.  After working the numbers on repairs I knew about, junk hauling, commissions and sellers escrow costs it appeared to be a fair offer that would net me a reasonable amount and avoid the uncertainty and time involved in the process.  Escrow opened the day after the offer was accepted and closed 17 days later.  I recommend Sellers Advantage  without hesitation.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

When I first came across the TV ad for Sellers Advantage I honestly thought it was too good to be true! At that time I had never heard of such a company that would buy a home, as-is, in any condition, with no fees! Nonetheless, I wrote down their contact information just in case it would be useful in the near future. A few months later my husband and I unfortunately found ourselves with a costly plumbing issue on our hands - and we just weren't willing to spend a bunch of money to get the repairs done on a house that wasn't our "forever home". At that point we decided to give Sellers Advantage a call to see what they would offer to buy our house. Damon came out the very next day to view the property, made us an offer, and I believe docs to initiate the process was sent just a couple days later. 60 pain-free days later, escrow closed, and the funds were in our account. Everyone from the sales team, to the Transaction Coordinator, all the way to Escrow was extremely professional throughout the entire process. It was an extremely pleasant experience and I'm still in awe on how smooth it went - with no hidden fees! I highly recommend Sellers Advantage to anyone interested in selling their home quickly without the hassle that comes with listing a property.< /text>

<Text>We had a great experience; we learned about SellersAdvantage because we were looking for a reputable place to sell our house that was in need of an extreme makeover. They were so great to work with that I wished I had known about they when I was selling my house that did not need a makeover.

From the first call to discuss the process of what they do and how it is done, to the Closing of Escrow e-mail and text, everything was on the up & up and very friendly & professional.  I know that the common saying of "If it sounds to good to be true, it probably is" is usually on the mark, but this really was better than I thought it was going to be.  It was truly seamless and headache free.  I would recommend this company to anyone interested in selling their home. Shout out to Damon, Melissa & Karla; they really kick @$$!< /review>

Sellers Advantage was very responsive throughout the entire process. The offer to purchase the house was fair. I was able to select the closing date and the company was very upfront and did all they could to make the process as simple as possible for me.<//review>

<Review>I was impressed with the company from beginning to end. They are completely straightforward, efficient, and professional. From the first call to California to the subsequent local office contact (who knows the real estate values of the area) and the contractors who came to the house, every one was wonderful to talk to and deal with. We received a great offer and everything was done within our time frame. They put no pressure of any kind on you; their contract is handed to you for review before you sign anything.  I would not hesitate to recommend them.<//Review><time>1560793321875< /time><rating>5< /rating>< resp>

When i met up with them we signed a contract within 24 hours. They were very flexible about the move date and they took care of everything. I did not have to have any open houses for strangers to walk thru my house or anything. This was the least stressful situation for us and we are happy.</Text><Time>1569444857335</Time>< pics>

<review>I had a seamless experience with Sellers Advantage from my meeting with Damon who explained everything and presented a very fair offer and with Troy who was helpful with any questions I had to Melissa who followed my transaction. It closed quickly and as planned.  I would recommend Sellers Advantage to anyone that does not want to deal with conventional listings and open houses etc.< /review>< Pictures>

The best home selling experience I have had!  I picked the closing date, they did everything else.  Professional, “on the ball” and easy to work with.  There is a cost but you decide I its a cost you’re willing to spend.  In the long run...I saved money via this route.  Thanks, Seller’s Advantage!</text>

We called Sellers Advantage when we needed to sell my brother in law's home.  Due to my current schedule I was hoping to find a company that was easy to work with and that would handle the 'heavy lifting' for me.  That is exactly what I got with the Seller Advantage team.  They offered me a fair price based on the local market and handled much of the process themselves.  There were even times when they stepped in to assist when I couldn't make an appointment due to family issues.  The entire transaction flowed quickly and smoothly from beginning to end.  We just closed and I couldn't be more relieved.  I would gladly recommend Sellers Advantage to anyone.</review>

< review>
I had planned on moving out of state and didn’t want to deal with realtors, open houses or repairs, one day I saw the Sellers Advantage commercial on TV and I said What the heck .. I’m going to call! ... Damon reached out to me and set up a free visit to my home. Within a matter of days he came explained EVERYTHING and gave me a verbal offer.. it was that quick! He was accommodating when it came time to close escrow on my house and I had to keep changing dates because it was contingent on me buying a new house!! The communication and whole process was SUPER easy and I didn’t have to pay commission, repairs or worry of buyers falling out of escrow or other horror stories we hear about ...😩 I even referred a co worker who Damon was able to help her out too! You may not get full value of your home BUT do the math you will spend more doing it the traditional way... thanks sellers advantage !!!<//review>

I had a wonderful experience with Seller's Advantage. My dad's condo was in terrible shape. They came in and treated us as if we were selling a mansion. They gave us a fair price and were professional and helpful. I would definitely recommend them.</Review>

Watch out for these guys. I inquired about having my parents house because my mom just passed away. It took them three days just to set a time to come out. Finally I got a date and time to meet with Damon. We met and went through the house.  He said he would have to compute the numbers and run it by underwriting and would be back with a number that evening.  Then crickets. Nothing. I reached out and the office said they will have Damen reach out to me. Crickets.  Nothing. WHAT A COMPLIMENT WAIST OF MY TIME.. Dont use these guys find someone with customer service stills.</Review>

I worked with Damon and his guys on a home I was trying to sell that needed a lot of work. They came out to see the property right away and both their contractor and the contractor I was working with agreed on what needed to be done. They made me a very fair offer based on those things it needed and we agreed right there on the spot. The home closed in under 2 weeks and there were no surprises. Had a check in hand the day it closed. Thanks guys.<//text>

I have worked with this company for years now as they purchase and sell property throughout California.  I've seen countless happy clients of theirs.  Their integrity, their service, and transparency in the whole process are second to none.  Damon, Courtney and Mark are great to work.  You will not be disappointed working with them.</Review>

Doug and Damon, you have sold our company many houses for flips and rentals.  I really appreciate the fact that every house we have purchased from you appraised at what you said it would appraise for and the repair costs were in line with the estimates.  We look forward to many more projects with Sellers Advantage.  Thank you.<//text>

Seller's Advantage should be the industry standard in selling houses. Straight forward step-step procedure, no-nonsense approach, very professional individuals working towards the same goal.
Will network this company to my friends and family for sure.

Thanks again to Team Seller's Advantage.

Overall nice location with friendly staff. Stock was low on many things. Very few staff members available to help customers, but store was not very busy. Store was clean and in good shape overall. Had some great items that were new arrivals. Overall a nice place to pick up some great bargains!< /Text>

Worst customer service. Had a lady trying to do a return of 12 receipts. Took 2 of them to wait on this customer.
Only one register open. I asked is this the line and was told "it's going to take a while".  Meanwhile the line was growing. Where was I suppose to go. Luckily a tall young clerk asked the other clerks if there wad someone to open.  She came back ready to open and wait on us. My question is it takes 2 clerks to wait on one person and ignore 5 of us standing in line.  Bad customer service.</text>

It is 8:52pm and they rushing everyone out the door. If the time on door says 9pm thats when you close. Someone needs to contact corporate. This isn't the first time they've done this. I've come in at 8:45pm before and they wouldn't let me shop. Its crazy.< /Review>

Just your standard Dollar Tree, the neighborhood is safe at day but not so much at night but so is all of Stockton, so be careful.

Selection here is limited as this is smaller than most 99cent stores for example, however, they've recently added refrigerator with some chilled or frozen products which is good.

Overall, I would say the Dollar Tree offer bargains on some products, but for some other products you're better off finishing your shopping in the near by Walmart in the same lot, so be mindful of the prices in both if you are shopping here to save up.
Drinking water is one thing for example that is cheaper in Walmart, and most canned goods as well.

The staff here is friendly and helpful, which is always a good thing and rather better than Walmart I would say in that regard.< /Text>

<Name>Candy Girl< /Name><Date>1617341791600< /Date><Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Primerica is a very inconsiderate, negative, pyramid scheme company.  It does not follow the City guidelines or have any professional stature. The company has parties which begin from 10pm to 3am with very loud music, in an attempt to gather new salesman (essentially followers). The police are frequently called to breakdown the parties. Primerica does not model or depict an insurance company. Primerica models and depicts a scam. You would have better luck with a legitimate insurance company.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

< Review>
The people are weird. Very cult like. My sister and wife were members for a while. They do have a lot of great and helpful information about life insurance. I love the fact that they preach financial literacy. The environment was semi toxic. Very competitive, you can definitely make a lot of money in the beginning, but once you loose steam, it’s hard to regain momentum. They are very predatory when it comes to your contacts. It is not for everyone.< /Review>

<text>Pyramid scheme. Joanna Cabrera and Gabriela Cabrera used the young girls, saying that " you can be your own boss, you can get 10,000 dlrs per month" too much lies, then use the clients from these girls for her own benefits and codes. Also they ask for 100 dlrs to check the background. Please young ladies becarful.< /text>< date>

I debated staying here or somewhere cheap since I would be checking in at 8pm. Basically I would be showering, relaxing for an hour, then sleeping and checking out the following morning. Why pay close to $100 for a room that I would spend so little time in?!

But anyway, I love Marriott so decided to stay brand loyal. I’m so glad I did! Despite the short time, the room served its purpose. The shower was so relaxing and felt great after a long day of driving. I enjoyed TV from bed as a wind down for the evening. It’s a SmartTV so I was able to enjoy YouTube videos! I slept well that night. The room was pitch dark which meant I was able to sleep in and wake peacefully (instead of being woken by sunlight). There was also next to no noise from housekeeping and other guests.

Staff was super friendly, both the guy who checked me in and the lady who checked me out. Everything about the stay was PERFECT!! and sold me on the concept of ditching budget hotels for good.<//review><Response>None</Response><Rate>5<//Rate><username>Acacia Willey< /username><user>108435871082934550789<//user>< Gmap_id>

We checked in at 6:00 pm. Climbed into bed to watch the NCAA basketball game.   Toilet would not flush after may attempts.  We were given another room.We again got into bed to watch the game...once again the toilet did not work after many tries.  We were moved into another room.They insisted this has never happened before.  They claim the rooms are fully booked and this is entirely unusual.  We were compensated by a flatbread.We travel alot in the US and Europe and Asia.  This has never happened before to us  We were not happy, but they did apologize.< /Text>

The staff were very nice, profesional, and helpful. The only issue was that most of the hotel was under renovation and I was not made aware of the fact until late the night before my trip and after the deadline for free cancelation. Not a good way for them to ensure filling there rooms during contruction.</Text>

<review>This place is being renovated. It is nice, but they have not worked out the bugs. Our group selected the hotel because the pool was open later and they had no limit on how many could be in at the same time. 11 kids in our group of families that stayed. When we got there, the pool was closed. Heater was broken. British lady at the desk was very rude about it. She suggested that maybe we shouldn’t stay there. Kids were bummed. My 9 year old flushed the toilet after a #1 and it backed up. Front desk said we’d have to move rooms because they had no maintenance staff on hand at 6pm. Elevator broke. Walked up to our room and our key card didn’t work. Walked back down and met 3 others in our group at check in with the same problem. It is clean and it will be nice when they finish and get everything figured out.< /review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Nice rooms. No coffee machines in the rooms. The breakfast is very limited with yogurt, cold cereal with regular milk (no almond or soy milk), packaged pastry, limited fruit, coffee, and hot water for tea, no hot chocolate packets. The shower in my father-in-law's room stopped working after one day but maintenance went home by 2:00 so he had to wait for the next day to take a shower. The pool is reservations only but there was not many people in the pool when we were there.<//Review>

< review>
I was not told that there was massive construction going on when I booked it. I was there to watch the Fresno State game on locat TV but it was so loud I had to go elsewhere. When I brought this up with the woman at the front desk, she was very rude and told me to call Expedia and cancel. Of course, at that point I could not cancel as it was too challenging to find another place. This is also the second time I have booked through Expedia here and given the wrong room. I always book 2 queens and each time I go they try to put me in a King and are rude about it. I would not go here until the construction is over and they change their rude staff!</review>

<text>They neglected to say that the property is currently under construction.  So 1/2 the building is inaccessible, and the other 1/2 is housing the construction workers.  of course the food area is shut down due to covid, and the coffee makers have been removed from the rooms.  the mini-fridge, at least in my room, barely worked. The pool, although open, looks like it should have been renovated years ago.  On a lighter note, the staff was very friendly and helpful - considering all the above would certainly cause some complaints.  There was plenty of parking & the AC unit worked great!   I would stay here again, but wait for the construction to be complete.< /text>< GmapID>

Great experience at this hotel.  Stayed overnight for a business trip and the customer service was great and overall a good experience.  Room was tidy and well kept.  Food is also good.  I ordered the grain bowl, Cobb salad and brussel sprouts.  All of which were talking and decent priced for hotel items.  Workout room is pretty simple and has a couple treadmills and an elliptical with dumbbell sets.  Would recommend for those passing by</review>

I was pleasantly surprised by the property. It's tucked away from a busy street, but extremely quiet. The room was clean, well appointed. Great TV, was able to connect easily to internet and use Netflix from the TV . Every staff member I encountered was extremely helpful and kind. The check-in, housekeeping, Manager, the Cafe staff- all provided excellent service! Well done Courtyard- Fresno!< /text>

Overall the hotel and our room was clean and well kept. The rooms are a decent size for a family of 4. The bottom floor rooms don’t have enclosed patio which I prefer for safety with my kids and I like to sit outside. The pool was freezing but my kids still had fun and used the pool. The surrounding pool area was nice, clean and well taken care of. Upon check in I was greeted with a smile and had a pleasant check in. My only complaint was the noise we encountered from a room across the hall that was being serviced. The staff would loudly let the heavy doors slam which made us jump every time and rattled our room. Hotel doors are usually heavy to allow them to shut completely, this can also be loud and startling. Overall a good stay.<//text>

Extremely grateful, you made every moment from my early arrival - you accommodated me with a room and food! thank you! You guided me to stores and had a salad made for me - pre lunch time! I can't tell you how much it meant to me to have such wonderful people helping me out. I was tired, had no sleep and had deadlines to meet - could not have been a successful meeting/business experience without all you assistance! Maria</Review>

We use this hotel whenever we are in the are for horse shows at the Fresno Horse Park. There is always plenty of parking. Mostly its really quiet and comfortable. The distance is worth the effort. There are plenty of food, gas, and other amenities along Shaw.</review>

desk associate Maria was wonderful.  Bistro had good food, but not staffed well enough, especially breakfast. the staff was good, but just needed more servers and preparers.  A breakfast buffet would be better.   Bar drinks were a little expensive. Room was adequate and hotel was quiet.  A little set back in, so better signage would be appreciated.  I would stay there again.  Nice place.< /text>

Great location being next to the freeway, but tucked away from the main streets which is nice for night time. It is close to many shops and restaurants. The staff has always been kind and helpful. This is the only place I stay when I had to work in Fresno. The cafe/bar is perfect for upper casual dining. Lots of options for different diets. The rooms are always clean and ready even if I arrive a little early.<//text>

Staff was exceptional! Room was decent but the road noise from the highway was a little loud. If they’d just install thicker windows it would be fine. Again staff was amazing!<//text>

It was very clean, quiet & the staff was very friendly! It is confusing to find using Navigation because the Street sign isn't visible from the road and the Hotel sits Waaay back off the main street. They should put a sign on Shaw with an arrow to make it easier to find. 
They have Pumps with Paul Mitchell Body Wash/Shampoo/Conditioner in the showers which was very nice.
The rooms are roomy and ours had a couch area which was very comfortable. When you turn on the TV you can sign into your Nextflix account which was really nice. Overall great experience.<//text>

<Review>We came to Fresno for a funeral. The staff was very kind & check in fast. Comfortable beds. Our room was next to hwy & we couldn't hear the hwy at all. Nice quiet stay. The only thing I would like added are some mats for floor workouts in the gym.< /Review>< date>

<Review>Great breakfast in the morning. We pulled up pretty late but were still greeted nicely and promptly. They gave us bottles water when we showed up also. The rooms were clean. My only nit pick would be the outside rooms are pretty noisy because of the highway but can't control that. I'd stay here again!<//Review>< pictures>

Traveling through the Valley for business during the summer isn’t usually much fun.  My group showed up after a long day of driving, in and out of the car in the heat... then we arrived.  Staff was warm and welcoming and had fun promotions going to earn points.  Originally all we wanted to do was get to our rooms, we ended up in the bistro for an hour for snacks and refreshments.  Valentina treated us so well we came back after dinner. This will be our regular Fresno lodging spot.<//text>

The Marriot is comfortable. The staff is amazing and friendly.
I had a 3-cheese grilled chesse sandwich at The Bistro. It was yummy
This morning I woke to find a thank you note under my door from the staff at The Bistro. I thought that was fabulous customer service.

All in all the courtyard is clean and comfortable with a great staff.< /review>

<text>The hotel seemed to be well maintained and modern. I had a room on the highway side, so it was noisy all night. While the are food options, it was not built into the room price. My room could have also been cleaner, which accounts got the lost star.< /text>< pictures>

Great hotel. Access to it isn't necessarily convenient, but other than that, it's fine. The rooms are big and spacious. The water pressure in The bathtub/shower is a bit low. Didn't take advantage of any of the amenities, so no reviews on that.< /Text>

Not technically a 5 star hotel in the strictest sense , but I gave it 5 stars anyway. Very clean, quiet and comfortable.  Courteous staff, and the best part? Lemon scented body wash and tea tree oil shampoo!<//Text>

<name>KMF< /name><pics>None</pics><Text>I am a "regular" Marriott member, visitor to this hotel.  I often stay there on business when my work requires an overnight stay.

Excellent customer service, staff.  Special kudos to Leslie, the morning front desk staffer, who is a real delight.  She always "welcomes" me back and goes "above and beyond to ensure my comfort, ask about my day, etc.  The cleaning staff also does a super job keeping my room, ensuring everything is well-stocked, etc.

Only piece of advice I have to travelers is to request a room facing away from the highway to minimize traffic noise.  This hotel is a bit north of downtown Fresno but it only takes a short 15 min. drive during rush hour to reach downtown, even during the rush hour, and it's right of Hwy 41 and near many restaurants if one prefers eating out.

Thanks for the great service, Marriott!!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>We needed a one night stay to attend a Fresno State football game and this worked out perfectly. Safe area (East Shaw Road) close to the stadium and staff even provided shortcut driving directions to avoid some traffic. Back from the main road, so a little tricky to get to if you miss the first road, but Google Maps took us right around to the back entrance.  
We were able to get a room next door to ours for our daughter, son-in-law and young grandson. Even though they can't provide rollaways, the fold out couch worked out fine. Grounds and lobby are really clean and nice. They have some fun games in the pool area (basketball toss, etc.) and the staff is wonderful. Rooms were clean and neat with a very comfortable bed.  One tip: avoid parking next to trees in the parking lot as they drop sap (which washed off easily, but was very sticky all over the car.)
Would definitely recommend this hotel for a short stay. Nice bistro/restaurant with alcoholic drinks and assorted food options.< /review>< Resp>

<review>We had a family member in the near by hospital and we were from out of town, so we needed a place to stay at the last minute.  We like Marriott properties so that is why we chose to stay here.  It was located near the freeway which was nice and it was only 13 minutes away from the hospital.  It's nice but seems to be an older property compared to other Courtyards we have stayed at.  Would stay here again if the need every presented itself again.< /review>< Pics>

<review>Courtyard by Marriott Fresno is my new choice when making sales calls with an overnight stay in Fresno. Courtyard is reliably clean, comfortable and safe. These are important to a female sales engineer traveling alone.  This particular Courtyard also has Starbucks espresso drinks and drip coffee on site!  I look forward to my next trip.< /review>< Response>

<text>Nice hotel, older rooms, new lobby. Automatic, motion sensing light switches are a nice energy saving addition but use caution getting up during the night because you'll be jarred awake as you trigger not one but three bright lights between the bed and bathroom. 

Trust your navigation system to get you there as they're behind an empty lot with no sign at the street.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<text>As we traveled from Lake Tahoe back to O.C. we decided to stay at the halfway point. Looking on-line to find a hotel that we can trust, feel comfortable, we know is clean and reliable and rate we paid was exceptional, we chose Courtyard by Marriott in Fresno. We were not disappointed. The moment we walked in, the property was modern, clean and the clerk was very professional. We were checked-in quickly. Our room was in a nice location on the property, room was large with nice amenities...large flat screen TV, modern furniture, very comfortable. We were very happy with our choice and we would stay there again if ever in Fresno.<//text>< pictures>

This hotel was absolutely immaculate. The rooms were fresh and clean. The beds were comfortable. The lobby was amazing. The seating area in the lobby where you can sit to eat was great for kids because they could enjoy some tv while they eat. The pool was perfect there was no chlorine in the pools. I would recommend this facility to anyone and this will be our choice of stay whenever we go up to fresno from Los Angeles area to visit family friends . You won't regret it.<//text>

Advised front counter the cleaning crew didn't restock my lotion shampoo, soap, etc.  they apologized and said they would come and fill within 15 minutes.  No one came.   Next day after work, checked. Atheism and still empty.  Entire stay never replenished.  I ended up going to Walmart and purchasing my own. When I checked out. 

Checking out at the Fresno Courtyard Marriott 

Manager: so how was your stay?

Me: well I never got new soap, lotion, shampoo, or conditioner.  I called down and was told some would be brought to me in a few minutes and they will make sure the cleaning staff doesn't miss.  I never received them and the next two days I came to the room and the bathroom was empty.  I was passed frustrated.  I ended up buying my own. 

Manager:  would you like a copy of your receipt?

Me: .... blank stare .....

He didn't acknowledge the concern and kept processing me out.  I stayed at this location in 2010 for six weeks and had a pleasant experience.  Not sure what happened to the customer experience. I don't plan on staying here when I return to Fresno for work.  I will ensure to tell my business partners to look elsewhere also.</Review>

Solid.  Excellent quality for an upper middle tier hotel.  Enjoyed their Bistro breakfast/dinner/drinks though the menu was definitely how one would view California cuisine.  Free range, grass fed, kale, etc on most items.  Though I traveled for work on this trip, I would stay here again.</Text>

<Name>KevinYin<//Name><text>Stayed January 10-13, requested for an upgrade to a suite. I'm a Platinum member for the past consecutive nine years. I'm writing this review as this is not the first time I've encountered this scenario. During check-in, the front desk staff said no suites were available.  I checked in and went to my assigned room. I pulled out my app on my phone and they had a suite available for booking during my entire stay. Mind you that I checked in at 10:00 PM on the 10th. I called the front desk and they said no suites were available, disputing what I had mentioned about the online availability. I went to the front desk and display the reservation on my phone. She had the audacity to tell me that I could have that suite at the price referenced on my phone.  I told her that the Rewards Program requires the property to upgrade my room upon check-in, if that suite is available during my entire stay, which was clearly displayed on my phone. Then she said that she could get fired for the upgrade. I told her they could contact me or the Rewards Program for assistance. Unbelievable. Either management and front desk staff are clueless about the Program or they are purposely in breach of their contract with the Rewards Program. Either way, they need help.  Having written all that, I would still return to this property as it is a convenient location to my work, with easy access to Shaw Ave. and Freeway 41. I like the property, just hate having to fight for my Platinum amenities.<//text><rating>None<//rating><userid>None< /userid>< Pics>

<Text>If you are looking for comfort and convenience......this is the place. You will sleep like a baby.....the food is excellent. Great way to start the day with their breakfast selections and a wonderful way to end the day with their dinner menu. Several calming spots around the lobby area to sip a glass of wine and read. Can't say enough. It's my hotel of choice.</Text>< pictures>

After changing rooms three times I was finally put a decent room that faces the courtyard. I would think that the front staff would be knowledgeable enough to not put a female on the bottom floor facing the parking lot. The young man who work to the front desk named Tyler is very sweet, however there is no one there to answer the phone and the poor guy has to multitask doing registering guest and answering phones at the same time. Do you think that provides a high level of customer service for the person question< /text>

My family and I visit Freno, CA every year after Christmas for the Hmong New Years. I've stayed at several other hotels in the area, usually looking for a good deal. I've had bad experiences with the other hotels so I decided to stay at the Courtyard Marriot this year. Even though it was only for one night (2 rooms), my family and I had a great experience and will definitely be staying there again. The hotel lobby was very nice, the rooms were clean and the staff were great. I also like that it was a short drive from the shopping center. I had forgotten to pack my husband's slack for the trip. I got in the car and literally drove down the street and got another pair of slacks. Even the security lady in the parking lot around 11pm was exceptionally helpful in giving us tips to a local place that was still open to eat. Overall great experience. Thank you so much Courtyard Marriot! You've made a big difference to my family. I'm sure my very young adult children will be staying at the Marriot when planning their stays away from home.< /review>

I was able to use the Marriott app to book my room for work. For some reason, I couldn't use the app to check in so I called and spoke with Terrence.  He checked me in, upgraded my room, set up late checkout, and other services in a breeze.

When I arrived around midnight, Robert, who had taken over for Terrence, had all of the information for my preferences and set everything up seamlessly. 

My only disappointment is not being able to redeem alcoholic beverages as part of my welcome gift for being a platinum elite member. Oh well, BYOB it is!

<text>Each year we come down to here to Fresno to bowl the Fresno State Tournament. We usually stay at a well known motel/hotel but it seems to be getting worse and not very safe. This year we tried something new. We tried the Courtyard. It was surprisingly comfortable and enjoyable. Everything was very clean and the staff was very welcoming. The bistro had great food and great service. I will stay here every year from now on. 

Thanks Courtyard and Staff! You rock! See you next year!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80945d619ace5149:0x7d3962810875c882</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Arrived late but the Bistro was still open and they did a great job of putting together an enjoyable meal. Mel, from the Bistro went out of his way to make sure we were pleased...and we were!

The General Manager and the Front Desk person also deserve a shout out for helping us with a personal need. Thanks to Lesley and Julie.

This was the perfect place to stay at as we ended a 18 hour travel day.< /Text>

<Text>This is a pleasant property only marred by the proximity to the freeway. Be sure to request your room on the facing the courtyard or away from the freeway if you are sensitive to noise.

The room was lovely, although the bathroom was clearly dated. I liked that the work desk was a pull-out so as not to take up extra space in the room. Staff were all very nice and the hotel had occupancy sensors and LED lighting, so I give them credit for being efficient!</Text><Resp>None<//Resp><time>1475769720691< /time><GmapID>0x80945d619ace5149:0x7d3962810875c882<//GmapID>< username>

It was a last minute stay due to car problems. Very nice room, welcoming staff, everything looked clean and warm. My only complaint would be the bedside alarm. Some instructions, or an easier to use model,would have been nice<//review>

<Review>I booked to hotel in the marriot bonvoy app with my points. When I got there the hotel staff was great. It was clean everything looked to be in great shape. I then proceeded to my room after leaving to grab some food. When I entered the room I turned to close the door and there was a cockroach . I i.mediatly checked out and  recovered my points. Looks were deceiving. Marriot bonvoy was a big help I. Taking care of me as a member< /Review>< response>

Old property but very well maintained.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The bistro was wonderful in accommodating a last minute, late night order of grilled cheese sandwiches for the kids; they did not have chocolate milk but gave us a bunch of Nesquick powder (for context, I have picky kids, and restaurants around the area had closed!)  Nice outdoor pool that the kids enjoyed!<//Text>

<text>I came into town for work and needed a hotel that day. The hotel is very clean and I was definitely impressed upon my arrival. I walked in and was immediately comfortable especially when the employees smiled and greeted me. Luis, who I spoke with, was very nice, professional, and made me feel very welcome. He made sure I was comfortable before I stayed my night which made my stay more comforting. The next time I'm in town I will definitely stay there because of the wonderful and outstanding customer service him.<//text>< Pics>

I will never stay at that hotel again; it is a poor representation of a Marriott brand hotel. The bed was uncomfortable, the elevator was dilapidated and far from the lobby, the lamp and plug on the right side of the bed didn’t work, the internet connection was bad, and their business center was so outdated I couldn’t print documents from my laptop.< /review>

This is our home away from home when we come to visit the kids. The location is great, the facilities are clean, modern and well maintained and the staff are friendly and professional. Though near the highway, the outside noises are minimal. This hotel doesn't serve a free breakfast but we prefer having the freshly made food and drinks from the Bistro, which has a lot of items to choose from. We've stayed in a dozen other hotels in town and this is "our hotel." The rooms are clean, the beds are comfortable and the bathroom is spotless. The Marriott app is also easy to use and it 'rescued us' recently when we found ourselves arriving late into LAX and needing a hotel in an unfamiliar part of LA. Within 10 minutes we were at another Courtyard hotel and were pleasantly welcomed even at 2am. Well done Marriott.< /Text>

WE have stayed at this particular Courtyard many times in the past. Prob 10-15 years ago.
We returned for an Anniversary Party and the first place we checked out was this hotel as we liked it in the past.
Wow, what a difference! Nicely updated lobby with a full bar and decent menu. From the lobby, you saw the pool area
through large windows which was a very pretty view as you first walk into the hotel.
Our room was completely updated also and very clean!
Loved our stay and will definately stay again!<//Text>

I stay here  once a month. I choose the courtyard because unlike many locations I have stayed at in Fresno, there are no crackheads hanging around. Aside from the nice accommodations, it is within walking distance of good places to eat and drink. It is always clean, close enough to my destination, and being recognized by the staff is a big plus. Place needs a hot tub though.< /text>

Not only was the bed beyond uncomfortable and ended up hurting my back when I woke. I go to check out and come to find out that you're robbed by all these little fees that really have nothing to do with you or anything else. Horrible experience overall and I would recommend no one stay there. You might get an ok price for your room but then when you check out you find out you were charged or taxed just for walking on their property with their hidden fees. Just a hotel hiding under a reputable name taking more then they quoted you.<//text>

<review>It seems like they’ve just completely some renovations. There’s a pile of old mattresses out back and the ones in the room were really comfortable. The pillows were also pretty good, although a little on the soft side. Reachable, working outlets near the bed. Decent shower and plenty of hot water. The room is nice and dark at night and the a/c works well.

The location isn’t the most convenient. If you want to go out to eat, everything is about a mile in either direction. The free wifi is fast enough for most work online.< /review><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

The hotel is kind of hard to spot from the main road. The location is convenient to the highway. Service is as expected and quick. Standard clean rooms and bathroom. Only negative for the 1st floor is chance for cockroaches/waterbugs (might be from the nearby pond).</Review>

< Review>
We stayed at the Courtyard Fresno in March 2015. We had a difficult time finding the hotel at first because our navigation kept sending us basically around the area but not exactly how to get there. I called the hotel and the lady on the phone directed us how to get there. Our check in was quick and the lady at the front desk was friendly and helpful. The room was exceptionally clean and spacious! The food in the bar/restaurant was very good and service was quick. We will stay here again when in the Fresno area.
The only thing that would be helpful would be a phone charging station either in the room/lobby or bar area. Not that big of a deal though.< /Review>

Friendly service. Clean room. Very small workout area. They do have an on-site food but only serves breakfast and dinner.<//Review>

The morning agent had a very negative attitude on granting loyalty member her benefits.  the property is very dated and old looking.  There was a nasty bug in the bathtub.</text>

Location is about as good as you can hope for in Fresno, despite being next to the freeway, you don't hear any traffic noise. The room was very clean and staff was friendly. Definitely a good option for the area.<//Text>

The hotel is located off the Main Street (Shaw) and can be difficult to locate however it has the advantage of no traffic noise and it is an excellent facility.< /text>

<Review>We were in Fresno for a baseball tournament and our team stayed at the Courtyard. My family had a perfect stay from start to finish, the room was clean and spacious, pool was bigger then most comparable hotels and had fun games to play when a break from the water was needed. The service was great from front desk to housekeeping and the location was close to everything we needed. I would definitely return in the future.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>Service not as good as one expect.  Their online booking for breakfast stay suppose to be included.  I had the email to show them that is what I paid for.  They honored it and made correction.   This happened the second time.  Be sure to know what you paid for if they try to deny.  They're likely get it wrong.  Besides breakfast is not as good.<//review>< user_name>

Comfortable clean establishment with helpful staff who try their best to make you comfortable and at ease. The beds aren't quite as comfortable as other Courtyards I've stayed at but the pillows are still awesome.< /Text>

Building is a bit dated, but they have kept up with renovations and we had a comfortable stay. A/C is loud and beds were a bit spongier than I like. Location is an easy hop off the highway, but entrance can be a bit tricky to spot.</review>

<Review>For years (since 1981) I have selected Marriott properties for my business related accommodations and they never disappoint me. Bill Marriott and his father before him, along with their staff and support teams have worked diligently through the years to offer the business traveler the very best value in accommodations, amenities and service. From their business oriented Courtyard Hotels all the way up the line to their luxury properties this company really takes the customers satisfaction to heart, Thank you Mr. Marriott and staff members!!< /Review>< pics>

I used the Marriott App to check in.  We had arrived early and didn't want to stay at the college for the sporting event.  I put the estimated time of arrival.  I received a notification that the room was ready within minutes.  This was a blessing.  While checking in, staff was very helpful and asked me if there was anything else they could help me with.  I explained how grateful I was.  I highly recommend the Marriott in Fresno.</review>

A nice clean hotel conveniently located near the freeway for those stopping over. The room was comfortable and the bathrooms had been renovated recently which was nice. The pool is nice and a real sun trap in the centre of the hotel.<//Text>

We had a nice stay at this hotel. As always, Marriott has great customer service. We needed five rooms for a family trip to Yosemite. Very accommodating, even received an email a couple of days before our stay to see if we wanted the rooms close together. Clean, comfortable and very quiet!< /text>

<Review>I am a frequent Traveler I always stay at Marriott Hotels And in regards to the Marriott in Fresno. It is one of the best hotels with good deals for rooms in the Fresno area. I was really pleased with the quality of service I also enjoyed the fact that they have a pool in the area and also how they have a restaurant and a bar if you feel like not eating within the hotel then you have may need local plazas and restaurants nearby you also have a outdoor mall less than 5 minutes away from the courtyard Marriott in Fresno. If I am in Fresno again I definitely will come back to the Courtyard by Marriott since it has everything I needed for a good reasonable price highly recommend<//Review><UserId.>112043961803740969395</UserId.>< pics>

The hotel is in a convenient location to the 41 interchange.  It is close to a lot of good dining options.  The facility is always well kept and in good repair.  The best feature is the staff.  They are friendly and helpful.</review>

<Rate>None</Rate><text>This courtyard had no amenities I expect at a courtyard. No complementary breakfast, no high speed internet, no clean and comfortable beds, room choice was poor (I was in a handicap room, which meant no counters in the bathroom, no shelves in the shower, extra stuff in shower, mold in shower). The price was also very high. I'm expected a lower price. I booked as a loyal rewards member but I'm so sorry I did that. I had no idea the price would be that high for a courtyard. I've complained to the operations manager but have not heard back. Another indication of lack of concern.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Friendly and helpful staff; excellent bed! A bit difficult to find as the address is on Shaw but the hotel is set very far back. Breakfast was good but, for the price of the room, I felt breakfast would have been included (it is not). Overall, I did not feel it was the best room for the money paid; will try another chain next time I have business in Fresno.<//Text>

< review>
It is such a nice surprise to find a quiet, clean and affordable place in the middle of a crowded, unkept and not so friendly place like Fresno. The staff at the Courtyard Marriott in Fresno was so accommodating, entering the foyer one is immediately invited to relax and the feeling of the hotel is so inviting. It is amazing that this hotel is considered a category 3 hotel because the experience and amenities offered rival that of much higher category hotels in the Marriott collection but we can keep that a secret!< /review>

1. You need to do something about your signage!!! I wonder how many people don't come to your hotel because they can't find it. While the address is on W. Shaw and Mapquest gives you a side street name, there is NO street name sign and NO visible hotel name from W. Shaw. You have to know that you are looking for an unmarked road, well off of W. Shaw. Very frustrating ... passed it two times before finding it and turning around on W. Shaw is no easy task at 5 pm.

2. I really wish I had the ability to make a cup of tea in my room in the morning. I was also surprised there was no complimentary tea/coffee in the lobby. Very unsatisfactory.

3. I prefer the hotel format with a free breakfast bar. Did not want to pay the high prices for the cafe style food so I went to Country Waffle instead.

4. On a positive note, the room was clean and nicely furnished, the small patio over the pool was delightful with a nice little breeze in the evening.

Great room and location for my business need, but just hard to find and disappointing not to have free tea in the morning.< /text>

The hotel is very clean and staff very friendly. The room was also very tidy,the bed comfortable and the shower nice with plenty of water pressure. The small issue I had was the military jets flying over and waking me up fairly early in the morning, but it only happened a couple of times. Otherwise the hotel was very quiet.<//text>

<Review>I have mixed feeling in answering the satisfaction because I really like my experiences with the hotel, but I could not sleep on the mattress in the room; it was very hard feeling and I could not get comfortable tossed and turned all night. I was not asked how my stay was when I checked out and with the way I was feeling, I did not want to share my experience. I had made arrangements for a late check out wanting to sleep in, but under the circumstances, checked out before 9am.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

My stay at CourtYard was a great and pleasant experience.  The staffs were friendly and professional compared to my experience at another hotel chain.  Courtyard made me felt at ease during my stay there even though I walked in edgy from a bad experience.  Thank you for making me feel like home!< /Text>

We stay at Courtyard Marriott Hotels on a regular basis.  This property was clean with friendly staff.  We know what to expect at a Courtyard and we were not disappointed at this Courtyard location.  We like being able to get an evening snack or meal with a glass of wine on the property without having to get in our car and find a restaurant.</review>

<rate>None<//rate><review>Clean, nice hotel. Room was small and noisy, probably because we got stuck by the staircase. Morning staff talk at the top of their lungs, and have long conversations in the hall which is rude when guest are trying to sleep. The door filters out no noise at all. Room was nice and had King bed, sleeper sofa and balcony. The hotel is very tucked away marking it hard to find. Has a restaurant/bar in the lobby, nothing fancy but its convenient. Plus you can buy snacks including alcohol at the front desk anytime.They offer AAA discounts. Saved 13 bucks. Overall, had a decent stay. Very Clean.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

This hotel is a little hard to find, can't see it from the main road. However, the rooms are nice and tidy. It has a bistro, which I have not yet tried because I prefer to dine at local restaurants instead. The bed is comfy and the room, quiet.< /Review>

<review>Interesting little spot this one.   Maybe it was our late check-in, maybe the unseasonably cold rain that greeted us as we arrived, or just maybe it was the sound of gun fire we heard after checking in...whatever the reason we ignored the spent condom displayed neatly on the ground near our door.  Other than that we had very pleasant and restfull experience.  Especially after the honeymoon couple finished the third bout of consummation.</review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80945d619ace5149:0x7d3962810875c882</GmapID></record>

<Text>The pros: plenty of parking, excellent food at the bistro, great location just a quick drive to Fashion Faire mall a drive thru Starbucks, Fresno State University, and very friendly staff.

The cons: older rooms, horrible bathroom lighting (for doing makeup), super loud freeway if you stay on that side, no smart TV like most of the Marriott's these days, and my room had a mildewy smell to it.</Text>< user_name>

The only complaint is that all of my previous Marriott stayshave had a breakfast bar that was no charge.
I'am lifetime Marriott awards member with over 50 years of travel with your brand(s) Residence inn's, Marriott hotels,
Fairfields, etc, I have stayed at all of them and was surprised to see that the I had to pay for sweet rolls and coffee
in the lobby/eating area. 
Just a couple of months ago I stayed at the Residence Inn in Bakerfield Ca and the breakfast
was free??<//review>

<Review>My greatest need for a hotel stay is the sleep I get. The bed at this location was so comfortable I felt well rested after 6 hours of sleep!! The staff were friendly and helpful. I was very happy to spend the evening sipping wine and chatting with my mom in the lounge area. The only frustration I had was finding the physical location of the hotel. It was about an 1/8 of a mile back from the road with no road signs to indicate where it was. I was told this is only because of the city's refusal to allow Marriott to place a sign. If I am in the area again the Courtyard Marriott Fresno will be my hotel of choice.< /Review>< pics>

I've stayed at many hotels in the past decade and the Fresno Courtyard by Marriott was one of the nicest rooms and hotels I've ever seen. It was very clean--the room, lobby, and everywhere on the grounds. The room and rest of the hotel had an ultra modern look and feel, like brand-new. All of the staff were very professional and courteous. The beds were very comfortable--not worn out or flat. The free coffee provided in the room as well as the shampoo and other things were all very high quality. And thank goodness it's a no-smoking hotel and there actually is NO smell of second-hand smoke at all, which is *wonderful*. I've gotten used to the smell of secondhand smoke in most other hotels, even ones that say they're smoke free! It was great to have free fresh-brewed Starbucks coffee available downstairs in the Lobby. The food at the hotel's Lobby (Bistro) was absolutely delicious and very health-minded. Just a wonderful experience, perhaps the best I've ever had with a hotel with the exception of a super expensive hotel I stayed at in Maui during our honeymoon many years ago. The gym was amazing for being so small it had more equipment and in better condition equip. than larger gyms at larger hotels! I would said the only things that could have improved the experience if if the place 1) had a hot tub. What hotel, especially one like Courtyard at Marriott, doesn't have a hot tub! Pretty amazing thing to miss. And two, I wish it had faster free wi-fi. The free wi-fi, at least from my room, was pretty slow. But since I was only using an Android phone that has a data plan and not a laptop, I didn't bother paying for a faster speed wi-fi. Other than that, because of this I'm going to look for Courtyards by Marriott from now on anywhere I go! Bravo, Marriott! Thank you for making it an extra pleasant vacation!</Text>

It's Frresno, so the bar is set low early in this review. The hotel is an analog for the city or vice versa. The Marriot has great potential that it continually fail to achieve. Like the city itself there are good areas and bad. The lobby and the pool overall are nice, the bistro and the bar look nice, but there are fundamental flaws in the design. The rooms are rickety, smell bad, feel cheap, or poorly repaired. You stay here out of brand loyalty. It's a Courtyard, and that means that it's better than many.< /Review>

If you need a good night of sleep, and do not have to wake up early, do NOT stay here.

If you enjoy seeing freshly mowed grass from your room, and waking up to the sound of a lawn mower, this hotel is perfect.</Review>

The location of this hotel is right off the freeway, giving quick access to multiple areas in and around Fresno. There are also a multitude of time killers in the area, including an actual arcade and laser tag. There are quite a few restaurants around, from your chain/franchise to the typical mom and pop, which is good because the food in the hotel is mediocre at best. The fitness area is lacking, only 3 cardio machines and a few dumbbells. The exterior is well lit and clean. The courtyard area Ha some seating, but it was raining so I couldn't enjoy it. There is a pool, but I didn't get the opportunity to use that either since its outdoor. The rooms were clean and the staff friendly, but for $130/night, I want a little more than the bare minimum.< /review>

The hotel is generally functional but the door slamming noise of people coming and going all night was unbearable. Do not have a room next to doors if you can help it. Its also hard to find, with GPS.</text>

Really great place to stay. Doesn’t look like much on the outside but the rooms are really nice as well as the lobby has a Starbucks and bistro. Will be staying here again for sure.</review>

Showed up to a free upgrade to a suite, would have been nice if traveling with the family.  Only stayed one night, so can't really say much for the services; however, I was not thrilled with the dinner selection offered and service at the bar/restaurant/diner.<//text>

<Review>I came to Fresno to see Shania Twain and found the Courtyard Marriott very handy. Comfortable, quite and clean, near shopping and about 10 mins from the Save Mart Center. It's a little hard to find as it's set back from the streets, but once there it a very nice and convenient property.</Review>< pics>

Stayed here some few times, coming from out of the States to Fresno for business. Stay normally for 4-6 days.
I find that the staff could be friendlier. It surprised me to find, this time, this place untidy at room level. Bathroom details, which I had before, furniture in need of repair and a carpet you do not want to see. Breakfast food option are not very good and very expensive.
For the price, there are better options in Fresno.</Review>

overall my experience was very good. I was not given the AAA rate at check in although I am a AAA member. The air conditioner in the room was noisy. The remodel is very nice. The bed was very comfortable as always. You have the most relaxing mattresses at Courtyard.< /text>

This is the 1st time we have stayed at a Marriott Motel of any type. We were very pleasantly surprised, by the complete site. This will not be our last stay here, or any other Marriott. Enjoyed the Bistro, the pool, and the room was very comfy and quite. Really appreciated being away from the highway or street noise.<//Text>

My 5 year old son is picky. He loved the room and the building...he asked if we could come back in the summer so we could go swimming in the pool. I enjoyed the good night's rest in the oh-so-comfortable bed. The room was comfortably warm, and the staff all seemed courteous and professional. My son was disappointed when I told him we'd be going home the next day. We will stay at the Courtyard again.<//Text>

Difficult to find, as it is set back about a block off the street and no signage to indicate where the hotel is. The elevator is under construction and so only stairs if that is an issue for people. No room service, but a coffee and bar and bistro. Food was pretty good for what I ate. Nice staff.< /Review>

Absolutely horrific.  The uncleanliness of this hotel stretches from the hallway to the pool area... locks didn't work to access room or entrance.  Dirty towels bedding left in hallway for most of our two day stay. No clean towels at pool.  Garbage left on tables and outside area from night before.  I'd hire more people to clean up!< /review>

Clean room, great service. Can be a little tricky getting to from either main road, is tucked in back behind business. They close the side entrance after 10 pm and if you don't know it was going to be closed it is tricky to turn your car around to get back out. But overall, great experience.</Review>

The hotel claims to have a Bistro but it is not a restaurant. A lot of over priced groceries (over 100% mark up) and no real meals. I arrive after a long day at 7:30 PM to late to walk a half a mile or to tired to use Uber, I could not get a good meal at the hotel. NO room service. A bar with sub-standard, over priced food<//review>< Date>

This is a very nice facility with an adequate exercise room, very nice pool, a basketball court, and business center. Though near the freeway, it is far enough away that there is no freeway noise. The room was clean, the staff were courteous, and the breakfast was very nice with hot and cold items. The bed was a little soft for me, but my wife liked it.</text>

The Staff here is truly amazing and actually care about the guests of the hotel! Alex, Chua at the Front Desk; Chris and Royce at the Bistro were the Associates I interacted with. Even though my stay was only for a few hours, it definitely felt like home!< /Review>

The Fresno staff made all the difference in the world. They were welcoming and willing to meet my needs. I'd stay there again and would recommend it to anyone. Many restaurants with a wide price range nearby and a shopping mall!</Review>

As soon as I checked in and was assigned to the room, I walk into the bathroom in my room (#221) to find a huge bug that is bigger than about an inch. Called front desk. I had to deal with a maintenance guy who was also scared of bugs. I was told "our hotel does not have a pest problem. It's usually a guest who brings it in" and was implied that it was MY fault that a bug was in the bathroom that I LITERALLY stepped into as early as 10 seconds after opening the door. Seriously rude, wasn't even given an apology. Will not be recommending this hotel to coworkers who travel in the region for work.</review>

<review>Good basic business hotel - Fresno is not a place where you can easily find decent lodges for a decent price (most are run down and sometimes overpriced for what you get), but the Marriott maintains its quality in lodging.   Comfortable, clean rooms and decent internet.  Has a nice food area to sit and relax in; food's OK not great, but convenient if it is Christmas Eve!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

The Marriott Courtyard on Shaw needs to look at improving the cleanness of the rooms, there were broken items, water pressure low, and bugs.  The Birtro is too expensive, when you have so many restaurants across the street at a reasonable price for what you get.  Housekeeping staff need to be more professional.<//review>

All staff are excellent from the front desk to housekeeping to the Bistro.The king bed room has plenty of room. The caliber of the Bistro breakfast has gotten better since we were there last. The placement of the facility is quite far from Shaw, though you get used to it, and it is close to many things.</review>

<rating>None</rating><review>Place is hard to get to if you do not know exactly where it is located. Directions could have been better. Upon parking there was a homeless lady defecating in the bushes in the back parking area. Staff was aloof and were dismissive. I did not want my car broken into. I also brought attention to staff when checking out that the Marriott web site initially showed lower price for room but adds extra taxes to make room more expensive than Orbitz.Other that that, room was clean and place is close to the freeway.</review>< Pics>

4 stars the iron in the room was not great. The steam button was missing and I could not see the heat settings in the iron. The shower head could use an update. Over all the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The only thing I would ask to have the staff work on. At check in we had a credit card on file, however we told the desk clerk that we would want pay cash for our room. The checked is out and charged the cc.< /Review>

The hotel overall is fantastic. The breakfast service is lacking in organization. We have stayed here twice and breakfast was delivered after other guests were served out of order. I ordered a bagel and a latte, it was delivered so cold I couldn't spread the cream cheese. My husband ordered French toast which came out first and was stone cold. Go figure, people who ordered after us got their food first and hot!<//review>

Ok for short visit only.  Hard beds and the light sensors are annoying, careful upon entering the drive there is a huge dip that can bottom out your car.< /Review>

Outside my patio door I had tons of frogs they kept finding their way in my room and the patio door kept falling off. The walls are very thin you can hear everything your does in the next room very annoying at 4 a.m. my room also had a smell of urine however housekeeping is very warm and pleasant and fix the problem right away we visit Fresno about 4 times a year so I definitely will not be coming to this hotel again.<//text>

<Text>The staff was nice but the smell of the rooms was masked with a powdery scent. The first room smelt like smoke and I had to use my inhaler and the second room smelt like vomit and we tried to air it out and left for a bit with the door and window open.< /Text>< pictures>

< Review>
After trying at least three hotels in Fresno, finally we went to Courtyard Marriot. Oh my god.  For me was like heaven.  Clean, clean, clean. Updated remodeling gourges.  Bedding, the materials was used for beds all natural cotton not plastic that the body get soflicated in it. Maybe few Dolores more than other dirty hotels which their floor were not vacuumed for a Year, but it worth a penny.  You need to try it to see what I mean.<//Review>

<Review>Courtyard by Marriott in Fresno is located right next to the freeway offramp. It has a well lit, inviting exterior with adequate parking. The reception is friendly and informative. As a huge plus, they are expedient. The lobby is modern and laid out for both medium sized parties and individual travelers. The Bistro, the ridiculous little cafe that tries to pass itself off as an eating establishment, offers to wide of a selection than its size can support. Add to that the over pricing traditionally found at hotel eateries and this is a recipe for failure. The breakfast is "restaurant - style." That means you pay for what you order. The rooms were clean, spacious, and well decorated. Second and third floor rooms provide a balcony with a view of the highway or the back of a weathered retail strip mall. The courtyard has a small seating area and a pool, neither of which the weather permitted me to try. The fitness room was three cardio machines, a bench, and dumbbells up to 45 lbs. There are also ice machines. For $130 per night, I demand more. I would not stay again.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80945d619ace5149:0x7d3962810875c882</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The courtyard was a very nice clean place to stay. Although we had an unfortunate situation occur, where the electric went out for 4-6 hours. I feel that the motel should've offered something for our inconvenience...(besides coffee) like complimentary breakfast or discounted rate for a night...or even an apology would've been nice.<//review>

<Review>Advertised price per gallon for diesel was 3.78 per gallonon May 24, 2021, as noted on their billboard. I paid at the pump with a debit card and spoke with the manager to correct the price. The manager told me to wait until after I pumped and to push the debit button, but there wasn't one. I went back into the store to remedy the problem, and she said it rung it up as credit and there was nothing she could do about it. I told her they were not advertising the right price and it's a shame they lost my business forever for a mere $2.50.<//Review>< Pics>

Functional. staff were wearing masks, covid-19 compliant.

Don't be tricked by the gas prices. Arco is cheaper.

This place looks like something you would findin a horror movie on a long deserted stretch of highway. It's old and run down.

But as I opened, it is functional. I got gas and I got twizzlers and I used a restroom.<//Text>

<text>Three stars because of the discounted gas price, if you pay with cash or debit, and the easy access from the highway. Lose two stars because the display on one of the pumps is broken, the working displays show the higher credit card price (+0.08 per gallon) until after the transaction is almost over, at which point you are actually charged the lower price, and one of the restrooms was out of order when I visited.<//text>< pictures>

There's no signs that would let you know truck parking is $10 dollars for 12 hours. Is a very small truck stop with maybe 6 spaces to park ( not parking lots). There's a fried chicken place inside the store. Store is open 24/7.<//Review>

Stuck in traffic, out of time. Lots of parking for $10. The driveway is adjacent to the I80-WB onramp lane (weird).

<Text>Watch Lakers vs Grizzlies tonight. Get free Taco coupon by wining and let opponent get less than 110 points. LeBron James got 32 points and controls the game. It’s weird that backpack is not allowed to pass the usual security.

First time coming to Staples Center and spotted this store.  Pretty good selection of Lakers, Kings, and Clippers gear.  The staff could've been more nicer but not too terrible either.</review>

<review>Quality of the store is unacceptable!!

Bought a lakers jersey there on my first visit. The glue that connects the number of the jersey peel off before I even get to wear it right after I put the jersey in the water!!!

No one is replying to my emails from customer services! Literally paid my jersey for NOTHING!<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeS2mEOYNrpxUYXF2IfzzooofOpn4OfonJW4fm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNH3la0wBSDR6ZHL5DtmZhqCwjoAa85uh8BPoZi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtkpEHTe7vE9UU7tzVZWPSDgOEiZMrk5q33fGC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqWK1TN8vzGq3YGdUADGEWeNuAnaH_Dc5lKZO3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

Terrible shop, good selection of clothing but you can't find anything. Store is a mess and the team's are all integrated on random racks around the store. They have these three sided spinning racks in the walls which are used to allow access to different teams apparel but the mechanism are locked meaning you are limited to only seeing a third of the wall mounted products. Staff are not that friendly and when I asked where to find a product I had found in a different size they replied that "the shop is a bit of a mess and you will just have to walk around and look for it" thought this was a bit unacceptable.<//Text>

Says it represents all LA sports teams. Nope, just the one playing with a 5min walk of the shop. No Dodger’s gear. Waste of an Uber ride. Staff? They gave zero F’s. They are like f*%k black holes...sucking up f*%ks and spitting them into another galaxy. They give zero f*%ks.< /review>

Not worth your time unless you know exactly what you want. Store is messy and they only have stock out of the team playing next. Witnessed associate argue with a customer that wanted a Kings jersey saying they don’t have it out, but all he had to do was spin the wall around to show him.<//review>

Super knowledgeable help from Jonathan with backpacking gear today. Have been to this location several times for tent rentals & other camping necessities but wanted to give these guys a stellar review thanks to the expert fitting I received from this guy today.Prices are very competitive, and these guys have benefited the community in allowing us to host some of our volunteer group meetings as well. Thanks for all that you guys do, Sports Basement!</text>

Unhelpful staff member called Diego who refused to let us in the store after the game saying it's closed even though we were premier ticket holders. Came the next day and tried to get a shirt, he says it's in the store room and we cannot buy it. Ridiculous.. utterly disappointed</Review>

Ordered a Jersey on Nov 24.   CC was charged when I received the UPS shipping notice.   However it is not yet picked up, I still have not received my purchase.   I have spoken with customer service representatives 8 times every time they said a "supervisor" will get back to me.   I have yet to receive a call.

Next stop, department of consumer affairs and hopefully a fine for fraudulent activity.</Review>

Horrible. All they had was LeBron. Seriously. If it was purple or gold the name James was on the back. And not a single Kobe jersey. Or any others for that matter. As a life-long Lakers fan I'm disgusted by this store and I'm embarrassed to call this our "team" store<//Review>

“TEAM LA” store?? More like “TEAM LAbron” store...billed as THE location for ALL the LA sports teams, couldn’t find much of anything outside of LAL gear. And don’t get me started on the workers - seemed like we were bothering them by asking questions...</Review>

WHAT A RIP OFF! I ordered a Kings "Pet" Calendar for one of my daughters. It took FOREVER to arrive and when it did, I was SHOCKED at the size (or lack there of). This thing was no better than a pocket calendar. NOWHERE does the web site indicate the size and given the price, it would appear to be a full sized calendar.

I will not buy from this store again!<//text>

One star because the doorman was very kind.  The ladies working at the check out, Marisol and Rosa were very rude with no customer service skills.  Not only that but once I got home the shirt that I purchased had a hole in it.  I'd recommend buying any gear online and avoid the store.</text>

Being in LA for work, one week after the NHL All Star game, I wanted to grab a puck, and a Kings jersey at the Team LA store.  As a Kings fan since the Palffy, and Robitaille days, it was a foregone conclusion that I'd make an effort to get there.  Unfortunately, not to my knowledge there was a basketball game going on, and I was not allowed in to the store without a NBA game ticket.  I asked if there was a time that they'd be able to open to the public without tickets, to which they stated "9-5 or buy a ticket", so being only in the area overnight, that did not work, and it was insulting to have them state I should buy a ticket to an NBA game I was uninterested in, just to throw money at them for a jersey.  The staff I spoke with were very unhelpful, and apathetic.  After flying cross country, driving an hour in traffic, wasting $20 on parking just to park nearby the store, and to not even get in, I left very disappointed.  No love for an East coast guy, thanks Team LA.< /text>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>I can honestly say that this was by far the worst experience ever for me as a customer. I had to park almost two miles away to start off. Once we went in to look for the L.A. Kings infant jersey for a very important family member's newborn on the way, we didn't get any "good morning" or "can I help you" Kids products were placed under the Women's section. Adult jerseys were under the Youth section. And to top it all off, some of these products looked dirty! But wait, there's more. I asked the cashier girl if they had any youth Lakers jerseys and she said "we don't have any". I had to ask when will they have them and she said "maybe when the season starts". Once I payed for the jersey, the same rude girl ringed me up and forgot to give me a gift receipt for the jersey. When I left, I had to say "Thank you and have a nice day" because she was obviously having a bad one. When I got home, I called and told them about not getting a receipt. They nicely told me that it was my fault, and that I can go pick it up if I was still around DTLA. And the cherry on top was when I peeled of the $52 Team LA price tag. There was an MSRP tag covered with the $45 price on it! I am born and raised in L.A. Love my Lakers and Kings, but I will NEVER shop at this Team L.A. store again. It is a shame that people like this represent our city and teams so badly. Gives our city a bad rep and looks bad for people that come from all over the world/country. Unfortunately, I did not get her name but I hope that nobody goes through this experience. For the price that we are paying for these marked up items, I get better treatment and prices at any local swapmeet or mall around the city.</Review>< Pictures>

Terrible service. Decided to go even with all the bad reviews and they lived up to the 1 star. First they were terribly rude and secondly one guy tells us they won’t ship a custom jersey and then when we go to pick it up they tell us they never said that and would have to ship it. I would never recommend this place, go elsewhere.<//Text>

<Review>This is a horrible store, they did not have any thing in size below a 2X and the staff seem like they don't know anything about the teams that play in staples center and the merchandise if I could pick a lower star I would.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<review>(Translated by Google) Actually not good to go around
Not too many types of things
Not cheaper
Maybe because of the offseason relationship

(Original)
其實不好逛
東西種類也不太多
也沒有比較便宜
可能因為休賽季的關係</review><user_id>106349490661968017263</user_id><date>1563237530200<//date><user_name>張秉中</user_name>< Gmap_id>

The price goes somewhat. Because I bought the goods here in official genuine, I can say that I am authentic with confidence.
I felt the inside of the shop was smaller than I thought.
Because we went at the time of opening, there were not much shops and surrounding people.

LAKERSのグッズ目当てに行きました。価格はそこそこします。ここでのグッズは公式　本場で買ったので、自信をもって本物と言えるでしょう。

(Translated by Google) The short-sleeved tee is of high quality, but the hoodie is of poor quality as if it's made of non-woven fabric and the basketball vest yellow LeBron is sold out.

(Translated by Google) Happy to fulfill a dream, come from France and attend a Kings game. But what a disappointment to find once the match ended that the shop was already closed. Assessment I will leave in France with a T-SHIRT OF DUCKS. Very disappointed with this experience and really unfortunate that the shop does not stay open longer after the games.

(Original)
Heureux de réaliser un rêve, venir de France et assister à un match des Kings. Mais quelle deception de constater une fois le match terminé que la boutique était déjà fermée. Bilan je vais repartir en France avec un T-SHIRT DES DUCKS. Très déçu de cette expérience et vraiment dommage que la boutique ne reste pas ouverte plus longtemps après les matchs.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Just a bad fan shop. We were visiting L.A and are ice hockey fans. It was not possible to buy anything from the L.A Kings on a Lakers day. That we can not fix our schedule on it is clear. That's why only one star. Because it was not possible to buy a PIN and a Puk, the seller had no desire to go to the basement where they clear everything. One would have liked to have something there, berlin and L.A yes have a connection to each other.

(Original)
Einfach ein schlechter Fan Shop . Wir waren zu Besuch in L.A und sind Eishockey Fans. Es war nicht möglich an einem Spieltag der Lakers etwas von den L.A Kings zu kaufen. Das wir unseren Zeitplan auch nicht noch darauf richten können ist ja wohl klar . Deswegen nur ein Stern.  Weil es nicht möglich war einen PIN und einen Puk zu kaufen, der Verkäufer hatte keine Lust in den Keller zu gehen wo sie alle Sachen hin räumen.  Man hätte gern etwas gehabt da , berlin und L.A ja eine Verbindung zueinander haben .< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Custom order happily accepted for those on strict diet. Ask how you want your food and will happily make your food how ever you request. Hand made corn tortillas are served with main courses. Thick not skimpy like other places. I order chile rellenos with green chile instead of red chile. Also mole is great choice. I come here at least twice a week. Would come more often but I drive by this area only twice a week. Great food and waitress are very friendly.  Give it a try, you won't regret it.<//review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Name or how to start. What they get lost if they haven't gone here. Homemade food very rich. And the Aguachiles don't even say. They are there to savor.

When they go, order the aguachiles. I hope you like spicy ones because your mother's son. Delicious..

(Original)
Nombre ni cómo empezar. De lo que se pierden si no han ido a qui. Comida casera bien rica. Y los Aguachiles ni se diga. Estan para saborear.

(Translated by Google) Make sure you check your receipts they charge more then the actual price on the menue. Then they get mad when you tell them that the prices are off stating the taxes are added on each item and also in the bottom total.

Look closely at your receipt because they charge more than the menu says. And if they are told they get angry. Then they say that there is a tax on each meal so the price does not combine when the tax is calculated below the receipt.

Fijense bien en su recibo porque cobran mas de lo que dice el menu. Y si les dicen se enojan. Luego dicen que hay tax en cada comida por eso el precio no combina cuando abajo del recibo esta calculado el tax.<//Review>

<Name>Michelle B</Name><time>1603735600498<//time><rating>5</rating><Review>A very personal shopping experience. Call for an appointment before coming in, remember this is their HQ, so it's an office as well. A very nice office! There will be a temperature check, masks and gloves are required upon entry to the building and inspection of the item. It's nice to be able to see it the item in person before purchasing, since it's a second hand item. They give you the time to look at your items, try it, feel it and I didn't feel any pressure. The staff that helped me are all pretty and awesome. Overall awesome experience, will definitely come back!< /Review>< pictures>

(APPOINTMENTS ONLY, REGISTER ONLINE) Fashionphile is located at the top of a dead end road, inside a privately gated/guarded facility.

Fashionphile is a HIGH END shopping boutique where you can purchase used bags, at an extreme discount.

They provide free water, chocolates and plentiful seating for your viewing. Selena was super helpful and provided us with a great first experience!<//Review>

<text>Tried to sell an item to Fashionphile and got taken advantage of.  They ask you to take photos and send them in for an initial review along with a brief description.  Upon review of the photos, they said they wanted to purchase the item.  Upon receiving the item in their studio, they decided that the item had "inconsistencies" and requested me to pay the $75 for the authentication fee.  They should have seen this in the initial photos and not even asked to submit the item.  It is all a scam.</text><date>1621976580237< /date><response>{'time': 1621978466057, 'text': "Hey Holly. We apologize fro the inconvenience. We can't authenticate items via photo. We must physically have the item in order to authenticate. The reason for the fee is that we quoted that counterfeit item and paid you to ship it to us. We also pay to return the item and for the box it goes in. In house authentication is not cheap, but we offer it free for every single authentic item we get in the door. We charge a $75 authentication fee when we return counterfeit items. (The fee is $125 for an Hermes Birkin or Kelly.)"}</response></record>

I had bought several bags from Fashionphile, with no issues. The last time I went, late October, I bought 2 bags, a Chloe bag, and a Gucci canvas tote. I got home and put them away in their dust cover. I wore the Chloe bag and had no issues. Right before Christmas, I pulled the tote, to go shopping. I was shopping, and at one point, I unzipped the tote entirely. When I tried to close it, I saw that the end of the zipper, the edge, had half the zipper off. It was ripped; it looked like someone had just shoved it back. I was upset that the so-called inspectors at Fashionphile had not caught that. I hadn’t noticed because I had not unzipped the bag fully when I inspected it. I called Fashionphile and they said they could not take a return, because it was after 30 days. I said I just wanted them to fix it. They said no, that I could submit to them to evaluate for a possible buyback. This level of customer service is terrible, for a store where I’ve spent thousands of dollars. If you look at the purse, I clearly have not used it. It’s clean. I’ll never spend my hard earned money here. I’ll get my pre-loved luxury bags elsewhere.< /Review>

Drove all the way down to San Diego from Bay Area and was told there is no available appointment for the next whole week. We should have called them before heading there. It is not your fault not our fault but just not a very pleasant experience. We decided to buy the Birkin from other store.<//text>

<Review>I loved them for awhile. They quote low on new items though. Disappointed that they are now charging sales tax,  I understand the Supreme Court ruling but the prices are simply too high and close to retail to justify paying sales tax on an item someone else already paid tax on. Fashionphile could at minimum lower the price of their goods outright. I had my eye on a Chanel Boy and the minute it went 20% off I was prepared to purchase, only to be hit with a $253 sales tax. That tax immediately cancelled the benefit of being 20% off. That was Thursday...today is Saturday.  No way it would still be on their site 2 days later at 20% off. You might as well purchase brand new for $700 more. It just doesn’t make financial sense to purchase high priced pre loved luxury goods anymore.<//Review>< pictures>

First time at Fashionphile.  wonderful experience.  Bright beautiful wonderful Ambassadors of First Impressions at front desk.  Brittney and Brenda.  The Buyer was lovely and very informative.  She took time out to show me their website and explained thoroughly the process of how they buy and sell.  Overall, GREAT experience and a lovely building.  Loved the 6 ft. LEGO purse!!</review>

<time>1561262706566<//time><Rating>1< /Rating><review>I was the victim of a home burglary, where the culprits broke into my home and stole several designer bags. As part of the investigation, my bags had been located at Fashionphile, since I was browsing online to see whether the culprits had tried to sell my bags. I called Fashionphile and had receipts from the time of original purchase to verify the serial numbers and to ask them to not sell the goods since they were stolen property.

Fashionphile told me that the only person that could speak to them was the Detective on the case. Subsequently, the Detective contacted Fashionphile and provided them a list of items that were brought in and sold by the same woman who had burglarized my home. At the time, Fashionphile had returned two of my Chanel bags and said that the rest would be returned after a judicial resolution.

Fast forward 10 months - the woman is convicted and I had reached out to Fashionphile regarding the remaining items they promised would be returned. Once again, they told me that they were only allowed to speak to the Detective on the case. After speaking with the Detective, he had informed me that Fashionphile told him they had already sold my stolen items at some point during the 10 months even though they were fully aware they were stolen property that were subjects of a criminal prosecution.

This company has no respect towards its customers and worse yet, seeks to encourage the practice of purchasing stolen items for resale in order to turn a profit. I am extremely frustrated by how they handled this situation and hope no one has a similar experience.</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80dc736d6d68558b:0xba06e8a985cefbe5</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I can’t recommend them enough - I am a customer of Fashionphile - both a seller and buyer.  Fashionphile has a wonderful staff, easy process to sell the pieces you don’t want anymore and of course their authentic pieces for sale which are fabulous.  Through their large inventory, I have found incredible pieces.  LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM.</review>

I really like FashionPhile, I have purchased a few big ticket items here. From a sustainability standpoint I prefer to buy things second hand, it’s better for our earth and our society. Great customer service. One thing that really concerns me that I recently found out is that don’t cross reference any data for stolen merchandise even when it’s done with serial numbers. For example, a watch is easily searched via serial to see if it was stolen, most jewelry stores who resale absolutely do this. It’s easy to do, but they do not, so I’m concerned that I could be purchasing stolen merchandise here.< /review>

I bought a Limited Edition Louis Vuitton Monogram Neverfull from them and it is BEAUTIFUL! It was reduced to 1195.00 when most bags with this design and condition average over 2000.00. It was listed in "very good" condition but it is very clean with a light patina. You can't beat the quality and price. It was delivered UPS ground with signature required and insurance all included in the price!<//review>

From the drive up, the gates man letting you in the parkinglot to being "buzzed" in at the front door. Making an appt is necessary. Add items your interested in your cart, and at the reception desk check in and they will pull the items from your cart. I felt so pampered and taken care of. Almost to the point where I prefer to shop here rather then the high end stores. Also, have sold here and it was fast and easy. Watch out it's addictive.< /Text>< pictures>

Both the ladies at the front desk could be described as icy as best. The customer service was really lacking and I felt like a burden the entire time I was there. The funny thing is shopping at the designer stores that sell the new stuff they treat you so much better. I thought I was being smart searching for a discount there but honestly it's worth it to pay the extra money for new bag at the designer stores to not be treated like an absolute peasant at Fashionphile. I wouldn't recommend shopping in the show room that's for sure. They lost out on my business and I am more than happy to shop elsewhere.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I was truly impressed by the Fashionphile headquarters. I have been sending them my items for quite sometime but had never actually been to any of their locations. It was an outstanding experience along with great service!< /Text>

< Review>
I had a great recent experience purchased a brand new with tags Hermes Rose gold collier de chien on ring and was very pleased with shipping times and the item was as described.  Will be back for authentic new items with tags on.  Safer than eBay.</Review>

{'time': 1610494871762, 'text': "Although most items sold by FASHIONPHILE are marked 60% to 80% below their original retail price, some items may be priced higher than retail. Due to the ever-changing resale market, prices are constantly fluctuating.\n\nA few reasons why an item would be priced above retail are listed below:\n\nVintage & Rarity - Vintage, limited edition, or special order items may exceed comparable current retail prices because of their market rarity.\n\nSold Out Item - When a particular item sells out completely at department stores, boutiques, or online, the item value may increase beyond its original retail price due to its scarcity and demand.\n\nDated Price Tags - Some items are several years old and have their original price tag attached reflecting a retail price from years ago. Due to price increases, these items are now valued above the original attached price tag.\n\nSupply and Demand - When items are selling at an increased rate on our website, the value may increase due to the demand.\n\nWe do offer Alerts where you can set up an email alert if we get the item that you're looking for within a certain price range."}</response>

The wait is frustrating, because your not expecting it to take this long for authentication. The process of quote and shipping was a breeze.. I will update my review when my transaction is complete. I am an impatient person to be fair to fashionphile<//text>

Came with a group of six and our server was attentive and helpful. The atmosphere is casual and they have a TV (low volume off to the side of the room) that they were willing to adjust channels for us. The quality of the fish was good and tasted fresh. Their rice is seasoned nicely so that it complimented the fish on top which I enjoyed. Presentation was pleasing and clean. I would recommend this for a casual sushi night out or with groups - they took us without a reservation with no hesitation.< /Review>

The service here is always great.  The sushi chefs are kind and often fix up complimentary appetizers, which is a nice touch.  The sushi rolls are pretty good and the prices are very reasonable.  The atmosphere isn't the best but its a comfortable place to get some sushi.  Our go to place for a quick good sushi dinner.< /review>

<Review>OK. Was much better when Mr. Yo was there. They are doing some sort of remodel or trying to update the decor...Rolls were decent but service took FOREVER. Once the rolls were delivered (by someone other than our waitress) we were never checked on. We had to flag her down to get more tea, our check and to even pick up the check. It would be 2 stars if the rolls weren't decent.</Review><gmapID>0x80ecf102e9b56829:0xd6f7c15740e7dc10</gmapID><user>102240572881986081412< /user><Response>None</Response>< Date>

Amazing service. Very friendly. We love sitting at the sushi bar...great complimentary salmon skin salad. They are always very attentive. I have never had a bad meal here...the Pink Lady and the Lemon Flush are my 2 favorites. Highly recommended.</Text>

I used to love this place but it's not as good any more.  My Sashimi Salad had plenty of fresh fish but it had chili oil on it, and very little salad greens, no rice at all.  My favorite Salmon Skin Asparagus Salad was different too, soggy and cut into smaller pieces.  My roll was wierd, a nice piece of salmon wrapped around some too-spicy puree of something.  Time to choose a new favorite sushi joint.  Everything here tastes the same, the food has lost its character.</review>

Do not go here for the Sushi I have tried Spicy Salmon Roll, Tuna Avocado Roll while the fish is fresh the Sushi is poorly executed in terms of flavor profile and cut of fish.

Go here for the Lunch Special! One word Sesame Chicken, get this and you will guaranteed be back, and get some extra sesame sauce. All of their cooked food is really good, so maybe if you get a cooked roll it might be good but I have not tried them.<//Review>

We sat down and they had "Wild 106" - a local radio station - on (loud) for music and the station was on a commercial break. Seriously? It felt like we were at a Carls Jr.

We walked out. Sumo Sushi, PLEASE pay a few bucks a month and use Spotify or Apple Music.< /Review>< Pics>

7pm Friday night.  Tables not completely full, nobody waiting for a table.  My family of four doesn't even get acknowledged when we enter.  After 10 minutes of standing there and having the staff walk by we left.   Not a single person was the least bit apologetic about customers walking out.  Apparently the last customer was complaining about the slow service so maybe it was lucky we were ignored.  Wish I can put 0 stars.</review>

<Review>Probably one of the better sushi restaurants in SLO. Great, prompt service and fresh food. Sushi can be sketchy, but Sumo has a very consistent quality. They don't have cheap splintery chopsticks either, but higher quality bamboo ones. I'm always impressepd with Sumo. Wonderful!<//Review>< name>

<Date>1475898863551</Date><text>Sometimes Sumo is a 3 star experience... Sometimes it's a 5. I'm not sure what accounts for the inconsistency, but it's a little strange.

The first three times I went, it was extremely good, and for a very reasonable price. The rolls were simple, but very well made and very robust. The spicy tuna in particular was excellent, with a bright red color that showed freshness and ample use of spices. The sashimi was mouthwatering and perfectly cut. Even the miso soup at Sumo is particularly great. My brother and I got out of Sumo for under $40 at dinner, and to put it mildly, we ate a ridiculous amount of high quality fish and appetizers.

But then I've been there twice where the experience was different. Despite the place being nearly empty, our server took about 10 minutes just to get us menus for some reason (not typical), and we got one water refill after we had already finished our meal (kind of pointless). I ordered the same spicy tuna roll, and it was completely different from my previous visits... It was a pale orange color, and was mostly rice. Not great. The California roll was also overburdened with rice and the surimi and Crab mix was grossly filled with a ton of mayo.

The price during lunch on a Wednesday was also somehow more than it was during dinner on a Saturday, even though the visits were just a few weeks apart. The staff wasn't as friendly either, and never asked us hoe our food was.

It's strange that the experiences were so totally different in a span of just a few weeks... But they were. I love Sumo, and have some great memories there with friends and family. I just wish they were more consistent.

Tips:
Sit at the bar. You get a lot more service there, and the chefs will even talk to you about your food. It's a nice experience.

Wednesdays offer extremely affordable saki bombs. If that's what you're into, I doubt there's a better deal anywhere else.

The spicy tuna roll is pretty cheap and is (usually) extremely good. It's the best I've had anywhere when it's done right.</text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Just started storing my RV here. Need frame of mind regarding security as I have had things stolen. This place offers 24/7 video surveillance plus the physical walk arounds during business hours. Matt was very helpful and made the initiation process easy.<//Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><pics>None<//pics><review>NOOOO NOOO Do not go. The renting process was nice and the girl who processed it was very helpful. I stayed longer than I hoped, so 6 months into it the sent me a contract and upped my rental fee. I did not agree with it so requested to cancel, and Chris would not allow since it was 9 days till end and they “appreciate” 10. I discussed my unhappiness with it and he was beyond arrogant and rude. He treated me horrible. I immediately put my request in to cancel following month. I expressed my unhappiness with two other associates who said I could have canceled.  Fast forward I am cleaning out my storage to move and so much of my stuff is chewed by rats and damages. As I walk past other units moving I see grounds covered in poop and shavings from rats. I informed the associate of the rats and they clearly all knew about them. You would think the money they make on the many many units there and the changing of fees they should be able to control rats. I was absolutely disgusted. The reason I paid for a storage was to avoid the stuff I need for my events to get any damage in a shed. Due to health and safety reasons I have had to trash it all and will have to replace.  Will be filing to have them replace the money I spent to replace everything, the damaged items and rent. I solely rented there to keep my company and items safe.

***2 NEW points - notice the owners reply below. Complete lack of concern or the money and damages. They know there are rats and his reply below shows how little they care. I am filing a case against them for damages and extensive money owed.
Also - when you sign up they ask you to review them right then and there, and wait till done. So you don’t know truly what you are reviewing. DON’T DO IT.<//review><gmap_id>0x80dd28c41ff4401d:0xf15b70b201a55085< /gmap_id>< date>

I’m so happy I discovered this storage place!
It’s always very clean and the prices are affordable and secure. I was able to get a first floor unit, verses the upstairs unit I had at Uhaul. They have an elevator if you do get an upstairs unit.
The staff is always friendly, and have storage supplies to purchase if needed. Great storage place!!😊< /text>

At first they had really long gate access hours and really reasonable prices. The rent goes up very often and the gate hours have gone down and down- 4pm on Sat? 2pm on Sunday? When do you think people need access to their storage/are moving? On the WEEKEND! 6pm weekdays- how could I possibly stop by after work? You charge us more for less access?< /review>

< Review>
I have had a storage unit (10x10) for many years with SmartStop. The location is clean and the staff (Chris), friendly, informative and takes their time to explain all of the storage units sizes and price. I added another unit (4x10) today (September 4, 2020), and the process went smoothly. Price is reasonable and the storage location is convenient to my new home. Keep up the good work.<//Review>

Some one broke in my unit and stole everything I own. Smashed the door and the lock didn't even matter. No one gave us any notification, only called us once. Did not try to contact us about the possibility of a break in. Said they can't really help us.</Review>

HERME with Smartstop GG has the best costumer service skills I have experienced. She has been very sweet, patient and helpful. Overall this location is clean, convenient and reasonably affordable. I will definitely be referring family and friends.</Review>

First of all I want to say I have dealt with many storage places in my past. This location and this particular storage place is fantastic, clean, the people are so kind and helpful! I also love the way the security works here, you definitely feel secure and one more thing the price:-) I’m just so happy with this choice…

<Text>This place is ok. When I first moved my things there the access hours were from 6am to 10pm which was convenient for my to stop after work. Recently they increased rent $10 per month and restricted access hours to 8am-6pm and 10am- 2pm sunday.< /Text>< user>

<rate>1<//rate><text>My father and mother got a storage unit in Stanton about 1 year ago. My parents kept all their valuables ion that unit because they assumed it would be safe, after all the smart stop self storage website does nothing but constantly remind you of how safe, well lit, and we'll protected there facility is. It's all a 100% lie. The storage unit my parents be had been keeping all theirs most prized possessions was broken into and completely emptied. It's been heartbreaking watching my parents go through this incredible hardship. The worst part about this whole situation is that when we alerted the staff to the break in they acted as if it happens all the time and there's nothing they can do about it. The incident occurred 3 days ago and we're still awaiting a phone call from someone at smart stop so we can resolve this matter. I have never in my life been treated so poorly. I simply wanted to post this story to warn anybody that might be looking for a storage facility to steer clear of smart stop self storage because your things will get stolen and when they do get stolen not a single person from the company will contact you to remedy the situation< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Very good and fast experience! Quick in, DocuSign, pay the fee and we were in the unit. The unit was reasonably clean. The access to our unit was easy and wide.</Review>

< review>
Definitely happy to be leaving this place. They have increased our rent close to $100 since we moved in there in 2018. It was good when we moved in, now the place is FULL of drug users and homeless. I have found used needles in the hallways before and an employee has said she finds them on a regular basis. You have to have the restroom unlocked for you by management because the homeless and druggies use is and destroy it (the manager told me not to mind the burn marks on the sink and toilet, she had caught someone smoking meth).  I would not come back to this place. They do not care who they rent to, it shows because of all the trash and drug paraphnalia left all over the property. They also changed the gates hours without any notification so what they have posted is not what the actual hours are.</review>

<text>I love this storage, It's like very clean. Also there's an restroom. I like that I'm able to get into my unit, until 10 at night. Have to be out of my unit  before 10 to not get locked  in. The staff is very polite and nice. When I first got my unit, Chris Padilla was very helpful,  explained everything to me asked if I had any questions for him. I really appreciate all his help.</text>< Pictures>

Quick! Helpful and informative!
Herme made the process fast while showing me around the property and she even explained the contract while I filled it out.
Great service and a dependable storage unit company!<//review>

Great prices and nice facility. On move in day we arrived after the time they normally do new rental agreements but the store manager, Conner, was accommodating and allowed it. Cathy was great! She showed us our unit and did the paperwork. She made sure we understood everything and liked our unit. Glad we chose this facility.</review>

However, when I started to use the number 1 elevator was broken and caused us to use number 2 elevator. A big time waster. The guys in the front desk were more interested in sharing their pictures on their phone. Then being responsive. They even said to me, "wait I need to show their phone image."Rather than helping their customers. 1 star for the guys at the front desk on February 18, 2019 at 1 pm to 3 pm. Pretty sad image to all your customers.< /Review>< GmapID>

<text>My experience here was so pleasant ! Every time I come in Cathy greets me with so much joy and it honestly makes my day. Renting here is so much better than most places I’ve been too. I will definitely be storing my things here for a while. The property is kept very clean, I actively see Juan cleaning and the facility, as well as the office, is always fresh and smelling good ! Great service, definitely recommend. They actually like their jobs and therefore give extraordinary service< /text>< pics>

My wife and I needed a smal storage unit for our excess home items. We found SmartStop Self Storage and spoke with Kathy. She made our choice very easy to choose SmartStop. She was very professional and honest. She made us laugh and we really enjoyed our little tour of the facility. She was straight forward and didn’t beat around the bush. She was also very personable and cared about what our needs were. I would definitely recommend this storage facility and please speak to Kathy she makes it a very painless process. Thank you.</Review>

<Review>SmartStop is one of the best storage company's I've dealt with past few years. Conor/Connor is one of those Facility/Property Managers, that's easy to deal with and professional. The place is clean and kept up to date. Since it's close by my home, it makes things even easier. What's also great is, I'm paying $50 less a month, for a storage almost double the size than Extra Storage. So far, so good. No complaints other than "The Walkers" that roam around lol but that's everywhere.<//Review><GmapID>0x80dd28c41ff4401d:0xf15b70b201a55085< /GmapID>< name>

Came to check out a storage rental, Cathy helped me out. The property was super clean, given the surrounding area. Cathy showed me all the promotions they had running, instead of just giving me the highest rates and price-gouging me.
She was very friendly and funny as hell! I’ve actually rented from another smart stop, and it wasn’t as nice or pleasant as this location. Fo rilz yo...< /Text>

This smartstop self storage is run so efficiently, the manager, Juan Garcia, runs the storage facility smoothly and nicely. When I walked into the office it was so clean and smelled nice and clean. I will strongly recommend this storage facility to all my friends and family for their storage needs.< /Review>

It's the least expensive storage I could find. It's not the easiest to access though, the units are all inside and if your upstairs it's hot  and hard to breathe so keep that in mind. Rates are lowest I could find. Staff is friendly and helpful.< /Text>

<review>I had many storages and this one was the worst.  They always had water bottles with urine in them either in elevator or next to stairs,  I actually had to call a handful of times to get them to please throw  the urine away,  after it sat there for weeks. They hardly ever swept the hallways ,(I have video )  of the discussing messy storage. I sprayed  with roach spray everytime I went  to my  storage, everytime I would open my storage there was these cockroaches unusually smaller ones,  running and hiding. My wicker there it had been nibbled on my rats. You can tell with the teeth Mark's. I had told personal and they said they would take care of it. my source of income just stopped and I was 32 days late, they charged me  lien fees $122.00x2 =$244.00 plus late fees $80.00 x 2 =$160.00 plus my storage fee $85.00 x2 $170.00, total of $574.00 is what I had to pay to get back into my storage. I immediately told them i was getting out at the end of the month. They didn't even care I was going thur a funk. My storage now they are clean, nice, does not put a lien on  ones storage until one is late 45 days. The staff not to nice after you have been with then for 3 1/2 years. I was told one day by a staff woman to take down this divider and I said I don't want anyone knowing what I have ( because I found a vodka bottle in my storage) from the homeless that hang out there at night. and the owners had seen onside my storage they  never said nothing to me. She insisted I take it down. And if I didn't I need to move out. And like I was a child , she told me to show it to her when I took the divider down. Honest to god I felt like I was this young child. All I can say when u first move in the associates are wonderful, nice but after a few months they all turn into like they all better than you. One pointer you usually treat other like the way you treat people, with respect and dignity. I did not have this at SmartShop in Garden Grove it's been 5 months and I absolutely love when I chose to go. And it's cheaper, and they rinse your monthly fee every year by only $10.00 SmartShop rinses your monthly fee $25.00 every 6 months. I would really think about renting from this storage . If you do you will see what I mean.< /review><gmap_id>0x80dd28c41ff4401d:0xf15b70b201a55085<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Sucks to see a good Polite Fair Honest Manager, Juan Garcia, leave the Garden Grove location. Very helpful and made storing belongings easier than at many other Storage Facilities. Hope Assistant Manager, Cathy Kidwell, continues to bring that helpfulness like she always does right alongside Juan as they we are amazing team together. As for the stand in Management, if they can even be such, this Leo person is completely opposite of management material. He fabricates stories and says things or protrays conversations and information to what he feels things should be and not to reality of actuality. He's childish and very immature for person to hold management position let alone position of any sort of power. He would be the person that's hall monitor and takes title straight to head and starts acting as if he's everything just short if not God himself. He should be taught on how to handle situations and how to tell truth not making up lies and fabrications to his own wishes. As for Marcos District Manager of Inland Empire and Steve General Manager and acting District Manager on somethings as for Rick District Manager is out for personal reasons,  I send mines to Rick and his family, Marcos and Steve are doing best possible giving situation of losing Juan as Property Manager. No bad blood with anything on my part with my eviction. I understand fully how business is business and that's just how business goes nothing personal to it.  Best to all Smart Stop Employees except for Leo who is bad business all around and most definitely should be given boot and replaced.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Name>Barbara Candemi<//Name><review>I have been renting from this establishment for over one year and have never had any problems. The inside of the business is kept extremely clean. I have read some previous reviews and a while back they seem to have a little issue with some tenants just hanging around but that problem was handled almost immediately. I rarely give reviews but feel this place deserves a hood review because any employee I have come in contact with has always gone above and beyond what I needed. I would definately recommend this establishment. Obviously, I have bern here over one year with no problem.<//review><userid>101712996589237713856< /userid><gmapID>0x80dd28c41ff4401d:0xf15b70b201a55085<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Just came today to help a friend rent a storage space and Cathy met us with a smile on her face. She helped us out to find the right size and the place is very clean. Will definitely recommend this place to anyone as long as Cathy is there to help out. She has great customer service and funny too.

The place is always well kept and clean, they are on top of everything. Kathy is super helpful and attentive to costumers needs. They also have a loading dock wich makes it easier to load and unload.< /text><userid>103527109171586127589</userid>< resp>

I didn't feel my belongings were in good hands. All of that has changed for better as of late.! Conner has really cleaned the place up. !You can notice a huge difference in the proffessionalism and sincerity of the facility. Were as jade and Britney were less hands on. Conner has an upbeat people person vibe and sincerely seems to want to make it a better customer experience for people who store here!!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
Juan helped me and took the time to show me and open up every unit. I was able to use the measuring tape and ensure the size of each unit . I have been shorted a foot here and there in past storage transactions and it was a pleasure having all my questions answered with sugar coating the truth.
The place is well maintained and cleanliness has improved dramatically over the past 6 months. Glad to see smart stop hiring the right people for the job. Cathy is great also as far as managing the facility as a whole goes. She doesn't shy away from awkward or confrontational situations , and she will put her foot down in the name of smart stop rules and regulations. The end result is a safer and cleaner facility , great job staff!</Review>

When we first rented a space for our trailer the facility was well maintained and clean. Felt very comfortable with the security cameras and management. Shortly after the management was changed this place turned into a dump. Our trailer was broke into which cost us $400.00 to repair. Management let us change our space closer to the front as the space we had before the cameras did not cover. There is currently a homeless encampment located directly outside the back gate. That would not be a problem but every time we go there to pick up our trailer there are countless homeless walking around the facility and trying to get inside. Last time we were there we had human feces with toilet paper on the ground at the back of our space. We are disgusted that this has become so out of control. I would recommend to anyone to search for another facility. Te security cameras and keypad entry are no added security to us.<//Text>

This facility is overrun with vagrants and drug dealers. The police are dispatched regularly for break-ins and other issues. Do not rent here. Your belongings would not be secure. Management/ownership does nothing to improve the issues. It appears they actually rent to homeless and allow them to live/congregate in the units. Other druggies and thieves piggyback in through the gate after legitimate paying customers and have free reign of the place. The gate codes, security cameras, and staff don't do anything to protect you or your stored items. I never feel safe coming here alone, even in the middle of the day.<//text>

First my sign up paperwork had to be redone twice in that process I lost my first month fee and they still have not honored it, next I rented a 10x 5 and  they gave ma 5 x 5 because no 5 x 10 were available they gave me a 7 x 10 in the corner with a low cowling. So nice of them.  Steve the  gm screams and yells at renters ( I have several recordings and witnesses to this) and also allows the employees to do the same.
There is no professionalism and the employees only follow the example of the GN
They restricted my access for holding the gate open for 2 minutes while I went and grabbed my phone and still have it restricted.
When I signed up they said my kid did not need to be on the rental agreement yet I am out of state and the keys are lost and he can't get them to cut our lock Orr and said if he does they will have him arrested. My lock my rent is paid call the police I told him to cut it off.
I am calling corporate offices Monday morning8-12-19  to complain but it is coubtful it will do any good. Seeing I was hung up on twice today when I proved them at fault.
I would strongly recommend everyone stay away from this place until a full change of personally takes place and not with employees from other local sites as they are all like-minded

<review>It is a big storage center that goes multiple levels. It's looks new and is very clean,well lit,and access codes are needed to go in and out. They order a variety  of storage  shed's sizes. There are carts to transport your  items to your storage if you can find one. There are also elevators. I'm Leary  of multi-level storage facilities in the event of power outage or elevator breaking down. Most of us storing items know that they are usually heavy and.bulky</review>< pictures>

This is one of the better storage facilities that I have rented from. The prices are reasonable, and the services is OK. The problems are that your screwed if you have to use the restroom as its ALWAYS LOCKED., theres a theft issue going on as well.  I would give them a B+ if I were to give a grade .<//text>

<Text>If there was an option to give negative stars for reviews I would give them -5.! Poor communication skills, poor management, 0 for effort in problem Solving They have no interested in Customer satisfaction. If there’s an issue they don’t care for a solution other than solving it their way witch is CHARGING YOU MORE $$ even when they are at fault. For a “New company” you would expect better and good start, Nothing but headaches and stress has come from them. They have 1 employee covering during business hrs who can’t help with anything when away from desk, lunch, restroom or showing 1 customer a unit or who knows what other reason. Main elevator has been broken for more than half the time, had 2 carts for more than 300 storage units leaving you to wait forever until u can load and unload. Horrible HORRIBLE experience would pay twice as much somewhere else but with a company that hears & listens to customers and works to make and leave US THE CUSTOMER WITH A GOOD EXPERIENCE.<//Text><Response>{'time': 1533234443720, 'text': "John Wick13, we're disappointed to hear of the negative experience you had at our location.

Two things I found annoying.

I needed to find a space for my garage stuff (tools, mfg supplies, household extra’s, etc)!

I’ve never rented a storage place before and I was surprised at what I discovered:
1) High rental cost
2) Limited access hours (M-F 9am-6pm;S-Su 10am-2pm)
3) Dirty and unkept
4) Unsecure units and property
5) Visible maintenance problems
6) A lot of renters that looked like they should be collecting their mail there

What I found at smart shop:
1) reasonable prices 100 for a 7x10
2) Access M-Su 6am-10pm
3) very clean
4) security of property is good and I was informed that I could secure my unit how I liked
5) Problem with 1 of 2 elevators being down
6) Some concerns at first

It’s only been about 3 weeks since I moved my stuff in there and so far it’s been good. I’ll repost if I find that things change.</Text>

Somewhere between December 21st and December 23rd are unit was broken into. Apart of set real units broken into during this period of time. All of our children’s Christmas presents were stolen, along with multiple items TVs, tools, even my clothes etc!! The girls in the office we rude and of no help to us other than telling us we were a few days past our due date of rent ( I was there to pay it and retrieve the presents from our storage as this was 2 days before Christmas) We made a police report & Garden Grove Pd tried to assist but ultimately it was my husband and I who caught a mother and son duo selling my children’s USED school backpacks on offer up & the low life was wearing my clothing!
Cut to dealing with this facility. No one followed up with us about the burglary. Not ONE PERSON! I got into contact with the district manager who did nothing! We finally get the insurance number after calling MULTIPLE TIMES and making visits to the location from the new manager (who was helpful but still nothing has been done)
I’ve called this insurance company over 6 times leaving messages in which they state on the message that they will get back to you within one business day! Hasn’t happened! So not only was our children’s Christmas ruined by these drug addict thieves that apparently were living at the storage place but this company does nothing about it. After months of the trying to be reimbursed for our things, I was told today that we didn’t purchase the insurance on the unit??? So I’ve gotten this far with speaking to many people at the facility to now be told we don’t have insurence on the unit and to check with the police department for my reimbursement?? What the hell? That doesn’t even make sense! Bottom line DO NOT RENT FROM THIS PLACE! This has to be the worst experience I have ever had with any company in my life. This WILL BE RECTIFIED!  It’s not the “stuff” that was stolen or destroyed it’s the fact that people took from my kids, cut the lock off and made away with over $900 worth of presents  for our 3 children and I had to explain to a police officer in front of them what they got for Christmas that they wouldn’t open on Christmas Day and I didn’t have the money to replace. It’s disappointing and disgusting how these people have done business. Save yourself the complete disrespect and headache from the bad business they practice.</Text>< pictures>

If I could give it 0 stars I would. This place is a joke. The elevator has been broken for 2 months. The people that work their are rude and are liars. They lied to me about not having any carts when they had them in the back room the whole time. Break ins at this facility. Just absolutely worse storage ever.<//Review>

Its clean!! Except, homeless people hanging out inside the storage. I dont think this place is safe. They cutted my padlock and put a new lock and stole alot of stuff. And yes we do have an insurance but they dont want to pay us.. I HATE THIS PLACE!!! Negative 10 is my rating for them!!!< /text>

The manager Connor has done an upstanding job getting this ship back in the water. The new management team ( Connor, Cathy and Jose) are always willing to help their customers. They genuinely care and make you feel welcome even on the worst day. Moving your stuff isnt easy and storing it isnt so great either but these guys have accomidated me with my needs as a customers time and time again. I highly recommend renting at this facility.<//Text>

Terrible service I would not recommend this place. The manager of this place did not let me put trash. In the trash container. I recommend that you leave the trash outside the unit. For the manager to pick up the trash the next day. Extra space storage  😠😠😠😠< /review>
