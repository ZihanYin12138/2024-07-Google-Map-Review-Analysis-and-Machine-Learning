Just had a new Sony 5500 deck and new Fairing speaker’s installed on 4/2/2021! Carlos was hammered all day and stayed late just to get my bike done! Awesome sound great choices and amazing personal! Don’t go anywhere else! Thanks again Carlos, and thank you Brandon for getting me scheduled!! My buddy Chad Novak was right, the best choice in town!<//review>

Hands down, best shop in town. My Dad went in to get a new stereo, backup camera, remote start etc put into his truck. We went with him just because my husband and I are more techy than he is so we could explain something later if need be. Brandon, I believe his name is, the owner, is incredible. His customer service is on point. They did an amazing job with my Dads truck and if something wasn't right, they fixed it immediately, no hesitation. They sat with my Dad to make sure to go through the system and teach him everything about it. They made sure he knew that he could call or come in with questions, anytime. My husband and I wanted to update our system, just for our own piece of mind, went and received quotes from other stereo shops and let me tell you, the customer service doesn't even compare to the staff of Simply Auto Sound. We will absolutely be making an appointment with this establishment for our stereo needs. Thanks for being amazing guys!< /text>

<Text>Would not recommend this place for your car audio install.
Here is why -
I got my factory deck swapped with an aftermarket sony system few months ago.
When I dropped the car off, I asked the technician if he wants a guide for install as I knew it wouldn't be any easy task, he said I have 20 years experience and do not need that. I was like, fine.. they know what they are doing.
Took 3 days and they couldn't figure it out, I made 4 trips to the shop and they did not have humility to accept that they don't know how to fix it. I guessed they need help, so I sent the install guide from Lexus forum to them with a step by step guide how to install it.
Even with the guide they still couldn't follow the steps, broke the trim pieces around the air-condition vents and did not even apologize for it or discount. On top of all that they asked me for more money because it took them more time.

When I went to pick up the vehicle they were rude and threatened to not give me any warranty if don't pay more than what they originally quoted me.
In short my experience was awful! I never had to deal with such unprofessional people in Redding. I hope you hire some professional people to keep your business going.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Great customer service and very helpful and full of knowledge about the products and services they offer. What is most impressive is the service after the sale which is something you don't normally see these days.  I am very pleased with the products I purchased and with the great customer service before and during but more importantly the service after sale . I am looking forward to finishing my f150 with Simply Auto Sound and starting my 2019 Chevy Tax. Brandon and crew treated me like I was a valued customer before I ever spent a dollar at their shop so now in me they have a customer that will always return to them first when I need a product or service they offer.< /Text><rate>5< /rate><gmapID>0x54d2ecb9f927234b:0x80833633c40dc5e5<//gmapID>< Pics>

Brandon thank you so much, I absolutely love this sound system on my boat! We truly are the Loudest boat on the lake. Thank you to cesar for taking the time to show me how to run my new system. It definitely wasn’t an easy job but I’m so thrilled. The black powder coat on my tower looks awesome!! All around I’m so pleased and happy with the work you guys did. Thank you for not pressuring me into buying anything. You gave me exactly what I wanted and your fiberglass work to patch the hole is top notch. Please feel free to post my pictures to show people your great work. Ps boat isn’t yellow anymore lol.</Review>

<text>I had work done by Simply Auto to my car about a year ago and was so impressed I left a review and I couldnt help but leave another. A small issue occurred so I gave them a call and without question they said they would take a look at it free of cost. The three times I've done business with them has been nothing but a positive experience and I cant thank the team enough for the stellar customer service. If you have work you need done don't hesitate choosing them, they back it!

Purchased an awesome Pioneer radio, GPS combo and Viper alarm with remote start.  I accidently put the alarm into Valet mode a year later.  I expected the warranty period to be over.  I walked in, they setup an appointment, 30 minutes figured it out reprogrammed the remotes and no questions asked.  Great service with a smile.  Planning on adding the anywhere start to the remote start later.<//text>

<Text>I visited all the shops for a new stereo for the truck I am restoring. Brandon was the only one that took the time to break it down what I needed and the best way to do the job. Plus a estimate that was 150.00 less than the competition. I am in sales so I no B.S. when I here it. Great job brandon I will be in soon for that new stereo.< /Text><GmapID>0x54d2ecb9f927234b:0x80833633c40dc5e5</GmapID></record>

Excellent service, great quality products. The crew all know what they are talking about when it comes to audio and security products and definitely helped me remember what it's like to get old school customer service which is impossible to find these days.  I recommend them to anyone wanting to upgrade a mobile audio system. Or add an alarm.<//Text>

<user_id>118097403494451809131< /user_id><Review>I live out of town so it was a big deal to make a reservation and drive my gas hog truck to Redding to get my led light installed. Once there , they didn't know why my brand new led light wasn't working properly and after a few hours gave up. They then told me they knew someone who would know what the issue was and would contact me as soon as they found out. Two and a half weeks later  and no phone call.

As for this case, I’m sorry but there must of been a miscommunication here. The installer informed me that you needed 100 amp resistors not the 50 amp resistors your kit came with. He said you where to order them and bring back to us. We do not stock these parts as we don’t actually sell them. Unfortunately we where unsuccessful in the 3 hours we worked on it and did not charge you a dime. Please reconsider a harsh 1 star review. We did not rip you off nor did we take any of your money here. We simply tried to install your parts. We do apologize for the miscommunication however and will work on clear communication in the future.'}< /response></record></dataset><record>

Everyone looking for Car Audio, equipment or just questions answered. should visit this store. I was referred to them by a friend, they were totally professional & helpful. Brandon & Jason have a great shop and took care of my older Chevy truck with care & great detail on there work. No doubt I will use them again. Respect as well as friendly is hard to find these days.

Best Customer Service ever!!  I had purchased a new stereo for my truck and had it installed by another vendor on Thursday.  The SiriusXM radio failed Friday night and the original installation vendor wasn't open on Saturday.  Brandon and his team graciously worked me into their Saturday schedule and was able to repair the SiriusXM radio so I could enjoy it on a planned trip on Sunday.

Nice job and THANK-YOU very much!  They definitely made a new customer for life!</Review>

<review>Came in with what i thought was a bad amp. Jason tested my amp finding that it worked fine then troubleshooted my whole audio system and found the problem which was a snapped wire on a sub woofer... a simple problem. He fixed it and tuned my amp all for free. I highly recommend going to this place before any others with your car audio needs.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

OK, so I had a new stereo put in my truck from a different installer.  I was having problems with the bluetooth phone set up so I took it back to the original installer and they could not (or would not) fix it.  I was in the area so I stopped into Simply Auto Sound and WOW!! They were able to find to the problem and fix it quickly and professionally and did NOT charge me!  Thanks guys, great job and bluetooth microphone works GREAT now! You saved me a ticket!<//Text>

<Text>I had a security system installed in my car a few months back and recently my battery went dead, which caused issues with the system and when I brought it in to have it diagnosed they fixed the issue and told me it was of no charge.

<Review>Took a chance on cotton candy ice cream because my daughter wanted something purple. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the flavor. This place knows how to make real homemade style ice cream. The owner is also super nice and makes you feel welcome. This is the kind of mom and pop shop I love to support.< /Review>< response>

Yay! First review! This place is great. They have so many amazing and unique ice cream choices because they make nearly all of it themselves. They let you sample them all if you want which is great because you've probably never had those flavors before. The portions are great for their prices and the quality is fantastic too. The staff is fun as well. My girlfriend and I love this place. It's a little hidden behind a bank so it doesn't stand out which is a shame for such a good place. It's a neat little place and definitely worth checking out if you like ice cream.<//text>

Of course I like this place! even if it's raining hard and windy, it always a pleasure to sit inside having some ice cream and just relaxing. we tried three different flavors: Coffee Toffee, Bombay Chai, Cookies & Cream. and we were happy.<//text>

Never been to your ice cream shop just saw your story on the news regarding the two women who happened to be Muslim and were berated by that bigot customer
God bless you for standing up for those women I am a Christian and I thank you for your stance. I will be bringing business to your wonderful establishment</review>

Because of the virus, the parish is currently offering weekend Masses in the parking lot with worshippers at a safe distance in their cars. It takes a lot of work from volunteers to organize this, but it feels good to worship together again.</text>

<Review>I attended this school from 1st grade to 8th grade. Served as an alter boy during my whole time there. It was a pleasure to come back after 20 years and be welcomed. Great place to pray without being bothered. You can hear yourself think here.<//Review>< Pictures>

So. Serene ..Mass feeds the Soul....Imagine  prayer echoes surrounding you. Think of all the emotions absorbed in the walls....This is where The Body of Christ lives in the Tabernacle. When Jesus broke the bread and gave it to His disciples knowing He would soon be Crucified...He blessed the bread...and said... This Is My Body....and gave it to them to eat...then He took the cup...and blessed the wine...gave it to them to drink. This Is My Blood...Do This In Memory of Me. 2000 yrs. The Catholic Church...keeps His Gift....Jesus said If we don't eat His Body and drink His Blood we have no part in Him....This was when many left Him....the ones who stayed and obeyed were killed and yet 2000 yrs later ....< /Text>

I have been coming to this church as a visitor for almost 3 months now since I am here for my work contract. I usually come on weekdays evening masses. I am so impressed. I feel at home. I can feel the sincerity and devotions of the priests and the laymen people that serve there.In fact, I decided to include in my prayers this church and the people that makes this church a great temple of GOD where His people can worship. First, I thank God for letting me find this church and I thank you all for being there to help me feel closer to God when I am in your temple .  Thank you .<//Text>

Beautiful church. Mass services are also great as there are 2 Masses on weekdays and multiple on weekends  (with one Mass is in Spanish). The Church inside is cozy and plenty of seats. Since I discovered this church, I've come here often for worship.<//Text>

Beautiful church inside! Lots of space and there is a soundproof area for families with small children. Doesn't seem to busy if you go to the early services. They also have a school attached to the church.< /review>

Although you are my parish community, there is need for improvement parishewide with all ministries in terms of communication, fellowship, working with our youth and seniors, and how each ministry can fundraise to be self supportive within our parish community.<//Text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Text>they had me arrested for praying in the church after dark. Some female admisitrator who is a priest-wannabe.  I haven't been to this church since, nor will I ever go to it again. additionally, they have "buyers and sellers" outside accosting you every weekend when you go to mass. this is a bad parish that you should both avoid and pray for.<//Text><Time>1456518959088</Time><user>100080978854462891386</user><name>Mark Gelazela</name>< gmap_id>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) I had a bad but bad experience with this church. I'm going to do my fifteen in the summer and to distribute the invitations we need to put in which church. It was with my parents since September to ask if they have that date available, but they told us that we have to come 4 months before my party. Then my parents got angry but they decided to wait until 4 months ago because my parents and all very family have ALWAYS gone there and are members. When it was finally February (4 months before my party) we went to ask again to set aside that date and they told us that there are two weddings on that day of my party (July 29) my parents and I were very very very disappointed and frustrated because there are only 4 months left for the day of my party and we have not distributed the invitations. We went to look for other churches and everyone said they need to go out and reserve a YEAR BEFORE the party. But why is St. Augustine 4 MONTHS?!? At last we found a serca church in my area and we could guarantee and reserve that day and the time I want. After a few weeks after I found the church, St. Augustine began to fill my parents if we still want to reserve. What a disappointment!!!! He has always come to this church and what a bad experience he had with them.

Tuve una mal pero mal experiencia con este iglesia. Voy hacer mi quince en el verano y para repartir  los invitaciones necesitamos que poner en qual iglesia. Fue con mis padres desde septiembre para  preguntar si tienen ese fecha  disponible, pero nos dijeron que tenemos que venir 4 meses antes de mi fiesta. Entonces mis padres se enojaron pero ellos decidieron esperarse hasta que llega los 4 meses porque mis padres y todo muy familia SIEMPRE han ido ahí y son miembros. Cuando ya por fin era febrero (4 meses antes de mi fiesta) fuimos a preguntar otra vez para apartar esa fecha y nos dijeron que hay dos bodas en ese día de mi fiesta (29 de julio ) mis padres y yo estuvimos muy muy muy decepcionados y frustrados porque ya sólo falta 4 meses para el día de mi fiesta y no hemos repartido los invitaciones. Fuemos a buscar a otras iglesias y todos dijieron que necesitan apartir y reservar un AÑO ANTES de la fiesta. Pero por que de san Agustín es 4 MESES?!?  Por fin encontramos una iglesia serca de mi área y podimos garar y reservar ese día y la hora que yo quiero. Después unas semanas después que encontre la iglesia, san Agustín empezó a llemar a mis padres si todavía queremos reservar. Que decepción!!!! Siempre ha venido a heste iglesia y que mal experiencia tuvo con ellos.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Most of the people are some hypocrites, praying with their bibles, they don't do a favor to anybody asking anything because God punishes me ... well maybe it's because they are bad people ... I tell you that it happened to me that my car was unloaded and I asking for help and everyone can't or deplain they didn't answer me

.I can't imagine if they weren't in the church or they would give their mother a bucket of water ... I was also allowed to have her bath and nothing answered they can't almost get incarnate so they could leave me the truth for that kind of people I am not religious .... because I do give and ago a fabor to aguien without asking for anything and ago pprque I want not because I fear God ... it is only because it makes me feel good to help in what I I can someone in need .... I don't know why they want the church I think it's just one more place to complain about life ....... It's my umilde opinion ........ and my apologies I do not know what the bible designed but there are very few, maybe one in fifty ... ... most of them all charge common interest and no longer quietly speaking of God ... on the one hand forgive me God and on the other side stabbing someone or but he's already innocent because he repented
... hopefully and if there was a god and all those fake people resisted a punishment ...... but I don't think that happens ........

la mayoria delas personas son unos ipocritas resando con sus biblias no le asen un favor a nadie nadamas pidiendo porque me castigas dios ...pues talvez sea por que son malas personas....cuento que ami me paso que se me descargo el carro y yo pidiendo ayuda y todos no no puedo o deplano no me contestaban

.no me imagino si no estuvieran en la iglecia ni a su madre le darian un vazo de agua ...tambien fui que me permitieran su bano y nadamas contestaron no se puede casi tuve que incarme para que me dejaran  la verdad por ese tipo de personas yo no soy religioso ....porque yo si doy y ago un fabor a aguien sin pedir nada y lo ago pprque yo quiero no porque le tenga miedo a dios ...es solo porque me ase sentir bien ayudar en lo que yo pueda a alguien necesitado ....no se para que quieren la iglecia creo que solo es un lugar mas para quejarse de la vida .......es mi umilde opinion........o y mis disculpas ay jente que si ase lo que dise la biblia pero son muy pocas talves una en cincuenta ......la mayoria todo cobran intresados  comvenencieros  y no mas ablando ipocritamente de dios ....por un lado perdoname dios y por el otro lado apunalando a alguien o pero ya es inocente porque se arrepintio
..ojala y si existiera dios y todas esas personas farsantes resivieran un castigo......pero no creo que eso pase........

I come here very often in the past few weeks, everything was fine until I discovered a hair in my egg waffle..... EWWW! I was half way finished with my food but this almost got me vomit. Excuse me??? Why don’t you wear a cook’s hat or at least avoid touching your hair when you cook???
Bye you lost me.< /review>

<Text>I went there because of my son... he kept mentioning it so I walked in to get him a treat one day and i spent my time waiting in line trying to figure out the drinks. The best thing was just asking the staff behind the counter to customize any drink to your tastes. Since it was my first time in, i got a variety of drinks and different flavors of Boba. Being Asian, I had my share of Boba and these are definitely differently made and have nice different flavors. I liked that the flavors were not overwhelming (like some you get when they use too much flavoring) yet have that subtle taste and aftertaste that is pleasant on the palate. I might not know how to cook like a Michelin star chef but I like to think I know how to appreciate good food and deserts. Definitely a spot to check out if you are within pickup distance. Definitely a trip worth taking if you "just need to go somewhere" too! :) Cheers.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

The milk tea was alright, but the boba was really good. Lots of customization options for your tea and pearls. This place tends to be on the sweeter side so I'd say get 75% sweetness unless you want your drink to be very sugary.< /Review>

Got the milk tea with black sesame boba. The boba just tasted like regular boba with black sesame injected into the middle. Bit of a let down as a had thought the whole boba would be sesame flavored</review>

<Review>Rude staff. They move very slow, serve customers out of order, and when my order was more than 30 minutes over the "5 minutes" she told me, she handed it to me without apology, and in fact stood there silent waiting for me to thank her like she didn't just lie to me and make me wait an exorbitant amount of time.
What entitlement. So if you want tea, as well as good, fast, friendly service... go elsewhere. There's plenty to choose from.< /Review>< pictures>

<text>Been here a few times and tried a variety of drinks.
Service: 2/5 stars.  Hit and miss in getting simple  order correct.
Boba quality 5/5 stars. Fresh as it gets
Drink overall 3/5 stars.  Excessive ice at inflated price.
Think I go to 85 Degrees or Sunmerry instead.
Better overall experience.< /text>< rating>

<Date>1601869757982</Date><review>Changing this from 4 to 1 star. Quality of drink and service went from great to dung. Went to collector my drink around 8.30 pm with order ending in 90282. The employee that asked for the order said order was already picked up by someone and when asked, did nothing about fixing the drink and had to have someone step in to say that they will make another drink. The remade order was watered down and I'm so disappointed the employees were not trained for a customer interaction. I've been supporting this store since the day it opened and now not anymore. Shame.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Good drinks but bad service. They don't even bother to call your name. They made me wait for like 40 min for a drink and never really cared that I'm waiting for them. Pay attention when you order your drink. You have to get it from them...< /Review>< response>

<Review>I have been dying to have one boba shop in this plaza and it's finally happening!! One Zo boba shop opened right next to the LA Fitness!! What a love hate relationship!! Do I want to work out first so I can drink this boba???

The store has really cute decoration and extremely friendly staff. I was really hesitant about roast rice milk tea. I love roast rice tea but I was conflicted about roast rice tea with Milk. The staff saw I was so struggling and offered to make me one test sample. I don't like to waste food but she was so welcoming. After the sample, I definitely fell in love with this taste and I bought the rest of the sample. I love the store has such hard working and friendly staff, go on beyond her work to promote the products she is confident with. Sorry I didn't catch her name.

The fresh made boba here is incredible!! Super fresh and chewy. The only downside is the price is $5 plus for the whole drink, probably because of the location. The cup is not really big for the price.

Man, I truly miss the time we could buy a boba drinks within $4. And I think with people are more pay attention for health and cut down sugar, $5+ gonna hurt the sells in a long run.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Here in Orange County there is no shortage of boba shops so it’s important to make sure that the one you go to is a memorable one.

For me, it can be classified by a couple determining factors:
- Customer Service
- Menu and Variety
- Taste (obviously)
- Value

CUSTOMER SERVICE
I wanted to touch upon this as this was the one most lacking. Yes, the cashiers smiled at me when I was placing the order but it was one of those situations where they do it because they have to and not because they are genuinely excited to serve you. Maybe I’m being too nit-picky for this, but authenticity is important and they lost a star from me for not having it.

MENU AND VARIETY
Now the menu here was a bit interesting. The menu wasn’t incredibly extensive but for example, their brown sugar options alone came with 6 different options. I had also never seen a black charcoal latte before and I thought that was rather unique.

The variety, though, comes from their handmade boba. This is the first boba shop I have been to where the store actually makes it for you onsite. And not like the kind where you buy them in bags and boil it in there. So they get some kudos for this one! If you look closely, their store made boba is more expensive than their other bobas. I can appreciate a place that has more than just regular or honey boba to offer.

TASTE
I opted for the simple milk tea with one zo boba in the honey flavor at 50% sweetness and 50% ice. I was a bit disappointed because the menu clearly says milk tea OR green milk tea but I still ended up with the green one (I’m a huge black milk tea fan.) I wanted a light sweetness so I could taste that extra honey infused boba. The result? Meh. I have been to plenty other stores with milk tea and honey boba and this one did not impress me.

VALUE
Now to be completely fair, tea drinks in Orange County are in the $4-6 range but because One Zo has specialty drinks with house made boba they are obviously in the more expensive range. End result? 3/5.

—
Overall, One Zo does have a bit to offer. I think if I came in with someone that really knew what to order or if the cashiers could tell me a little bit more about their menu I would have likely ordered something that I would have truly loved. Needless to say, it isn’t the closest shop to me so I can’t say I’m gonna miss out on this one.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPItScekz1vNGt4wZO2IhmjLnOJCQCbgKFJM6_K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPR1JKFGCG6ajZsE6ufMWvJV6VTJYgQsu3FOM-0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7HgWpnlZdaM64pCLoh5vGmnnVzOUARKcwYqT0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJ25GRKDhLDOHC8zOq549VYWwSxZo-aH87Psb4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM__c_XkqKf45f-xqh-O4q7YXjxDyDApA10_0b-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNU7zLyP5DeF3YdLumBEg0HtpN6tFrqQxYvc1MD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dcdd68cbc85895:0x1b4ed0cbd9aa5dff</gmap_id></record>

One Zo is definitely in my top 5 list of bobas that you must try. They make all their bobas in house, and the specialize in different flavored bobas. My favorite is tbeir sesame milk tea with sesame bobas. It’s a must try.

At the Irvine location, Covid-19 rules are enforced. 6 feet apart, practice social distance, only takes card payments, and everyone is wearing a mask inside.

Please be a good sport and wear your mask too.< /review>

<text>It's great that the bobas are made in store. But um, what's the deal with the gigantic jar of Coffee Mate in the back? Milk is important when it comes to milk tea. At this day and age when other vendors are using milk from Straus Family Creamery, seeing that jar of creamer powder is such a visual turn-off.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcdd68cbc85895:0x1b4ed0cbd9aa5dff< /Gmap_id></record>

<review>Love this boba chain and glad they finally opened one up in South OC.  Their freshly made boba is so soft and addicting.  Highly recommended!</review><username>Andy Hendrawan</username></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I've come me here 5 times now with the first 4 times them out of what I want, and this time I came, waiting in line for 20 minutes for my drinks, got them starting driving home then I noticed they got my order wrong. Went back told them and they just said ok sorry, poored out a quarter of my drink and pored back half of it with the snow cap that was supposed to be on in. And on the menu it said this snow cap drink is 5$ and they still charged the extra 75cents. So I ended up waiting almost an hour total. Got over charge l. And got less lukewarm tea with some snowcap. They didn't offer to remake it, a free drink nk, or even say poor it in a large cup then add snowcap, each and every time I have come here I have had a terrible experience and service. Out off all the tea places I've been, none have ever been this consistently terrible</review>

chrysanthemum milk tea w/ chrysanthemum boba: 5/5
honey chrysanthemum tea w/ chrysanthemum boba: 3/5
roasted rice milk tea w/ chrysanthemum boba: 5/5
black sesame milk tea w/ black sesame boba: 2/5, way too sweet even when I requested no added sweetness, won't be getting this one again
strawberry smoothie w/ strawberry boba: 4/5
strawberry green tea w/ strawberry boba: 3/5
uji matcha latte: 4/5
onezo milk tea: 4/5
bamboo charcoal latte: 2/5, I don't know what bamboo charcoal is even supposed to taste like but this drink wasn't impressive by any means
onezo fruit tea: 2/5, may try this again and request for less sugar instead of no sugar to see if it tastes any better.</review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>This was the worst pizza I’ve ever eaten. I don’t normally seek these out. But I needed to let you know! It’s the greasy-est, underbaked crusts (so soft), toppings were minuscule! I mean chopped to disintegration! One of my toppings was pepperoni, I had 4 pieces on my whole pizza. It’s the only thing I could recognize. And the sauce was so so sweet!  Terrible, worst pizza ever.</Text>< pictures>

<text>Seriously quality pizza.  The staff I have interacted with have been super nice.  However Every single time I order I get a call and am told they are out of something I have ordered. The menu online seems to be out of date as at least 1 Item the Hot Cheeto pizza is no longer a thing for them.  The pros far outweigh the cons and this is leaps and bounds better than the chain pizza available in the area.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Review>Had to try this place out for the first time. Ordered 2 large pizzas and 20 wings. We were very satisfied and will return to try out their Philly cheese steak sandwiches and other items. After I called in my order, I was surprised to get a call back to verify the type of crust I wanted for my pizzas. I really appreciate them for doing that.<//Review><rate>5</rate></record></dataset><record>

<date>1592759979255<//date><userid>107394336539649298219</userid><text>Horrible experience.

We placed an order online, and we forgot to apply a coupon. My wife called the store to see if we were able to add the coupon. However, the person who answered said no. My wife asked if we can cancel the order over the phone with him; he said no, and that she must go online to cancel the order. We went online to our Winzza account, and there was not an option to cancel the order. Therefore, we decided not to cancel the order.

About an hour in, I got a call from the delivery driver. I go outside and he only had fries for me. I stated, I ordered pizza as well, he said that he didn't know about the pizzas. He called the store, and spoke to a guy named Javier. Javier told the driver that the pizzas were not ready. The driver then told me that he would come back and re-deliver the pizzas.

An hour goes by, no pizzas. My wife called the store and Javier picked up. We asked about the order and he said that we canceled the order . She explained that there were no options online to cancel the order, and we did not cancel the order. Javier than said that we canceled the order with him. We were confused because the very first time we called, Javier stated that we were not able to cancel an order with him or over the phone.

Javier just assumed that we were going to cancel the order, and he cancelled the order without a confirmation from our part.

I was not upset about the mistake, we're humans and we make mistakes. I was upset because Javier was very defensive, and blaming us for everything. Also, every time my wife tried to speak to him, he would not listen and cut her off. I  then spoke to Javier, and insisted that he needed to listen to our concerns and to please stop cutting us off.

Javier did not care about our concerns, he kept cutting us off, and continued to be very defensive. That's when I stated, Javier; I'm going to be the bigger person and end this conversation because we're going no where. I said bye, have a great night, and take care.

That was my horrible experience with Winzza, and hopefully; nobody experiences that.< /text>< resp>

This place is extremely delicious. The quality of pizza, salads, desserts etc. are what keeps me from purchasing here as oppose to the big chains. My kids won’t eat pizza unless it’s Winzza! Kids don’t lie.</Text>

<text>Very delicious.  Cooked perfectly. Nicely packaged. Compares well against other groups locally who offer similar fare. Everything was great and the boneless wings are exceptional in taste and the breading is better than any other we have tried . That means a lot to me as breaded wings usually don't interest me .</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Time>1591910598884</Time><review>Very disappointed I use to luv the philly steak sandwich
I ordered it today for 2 people spent $30+ dollars to have the sandwich was totally different
Bread was different...and hard...Ingredients didn't seem as fresh...👎
I just waisted $$
Always ordered from here versus another place which was close 2nd...now going back to other location
This just dropped off my order list 😔
So wasn't worth $30
Last week placed an order and was charged for the order
But order was never received then I was  not able to reach them so had to call next day for refund and told refund can take up to 7 days😡
Have always luved there pizza and response to correct errors
but seem to have more errors than it's worth
Going to do most of my ordering from other place from now on</review>< Rating>

<Review>I am writing this review, hoping the owner will read it. I have recently started ordering my Saturday pizza from her after going there thinking it was still Pizza Man.  The first time I tried it,  as a walk in customer and it was pretty good.  The next time I called in the order for pick up. And it was not correct. But still ate it. The third time I walk in and it was good. The next time, and today, I called it in, and again it was the wrong toppings……. Bottom line is, the phone orders are always with the wrong toppings.  I would recommend for you to training your staff, better, maybe repeating the order to the customers, before hanging up the phone.  Or create an e-mail or text method of ordering,  It might save you some customers</Review><GmapID>0x80c28e297dafffff:0xccb4c32495275566< /GmapID><UserId.>110317176452041238688<//UserId.><username>paul meza<//username><Date>1532227673075</Date>< pictures>

THIS HAPPENED 2 DAYS AGO WHEN IT WAS STORMY OUTSIDE. I ordered a large pizza to go and 2 bottled waters the price is higher for delivery than if I were to pick it up that I didn't know when I called. They make their own tip I guess that's what they do because when the price went up I knew I didn't have what she quoted and be able to tip myself as I usually do to any delivery person of food I order unless there are circumstances that make me not. I was told for me to get the lesser price I'd have to come pick it up. THE Streets were flooded, pouring down raining too might I add well I tried to but the step off the curbs was mini rivers . I could jump it going but what if I dropped the Pizza jumping the streams to go home? I cancelled my order telling the girl that I couldn't make the walk in that pouring down rain that the streets are flooded. She said she had already made the Pizza, AN ! I'm not picking it up and didn't have enough cash on me to pay for delivery so it really wasn't my problem. My feelings on this their hard up for a tip that they charge extra off top. Domino's and Pizza hut don't do that and they're much better than this place. I was just trying to help a small business verses mega chains of stores. Let me say this that the last time I ordered 10 piece wings they were absolutely SOGGY AND GROSS FRIED IN OLD GREASE !! I called and complained and they offered to give me a 10 piece for free. I left my name with the same girl that always answers the phone that when I'm ready I'd call to get it. When I finally call to take advantage of my free offer I couldn't chance getting SOGGY, COOKED IN DIRTY GREASE CHICKEN again so I asked could I exchange it for a large Pizza which is the same price as the 10 piece wings. She said yes and delivered it with NO EXTRA CHARGE FOR DELIVERY 🤨 ! I SPECIFICALLY DID NOT TIP HER WHEN SHE DELIVERED THAT PIZZA BECAUSE OF THE BIG INCONVENIENCES I HAD WENT THROUGH PRIOR AND REASON FOR THE FREE FOOD IN THE FIRST PLACE!! I had purchased the wings as a walk in had to wait super long because they had ORDERS before me then to get it home and know why the wings are soggy and nasty OLD GREASE ! THE COOK WAS TOO LAZY TO USE FRESH GREASE AND THOUGHT CUSTOMERS WOULDN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.. WELL EVIDENTLY I DID AND SO DID OTHERS WHO CALLED WITH THE SAME COMPLAINT THE GIRL ADMITTED TO ME ABOUT THE OLD GREASE AND OTHER COMPLAINTS SO IT'S NOT LIKE I'M GUESSING! SHE ALSO IS THE PERSON WHO TOOK THIS NEW ORDER AND TRIED TO GET A TIP OFF TOP SINCE I DIDN'T TIP HER LAST DELIVERY!!! I  WAS A REGULAR SHE KNOWS WHO I AM BY VOICE AND FACE SO DON'T YOU THINK RATHER THAN MAKING A GRANNY COME GET A PIZZA AND WATER IN THE POURING DOWN RAIN AND FLOODING STREETS AND BECAUSE I WAS A REGULAR ( NOT ANYMORE ) SHE'D HAVE GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS TO SAY I WILL DELIVER YOUR PIZZA DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE EXTRA ! BUT NOPE AND LET ME SAY THIS YOUR FOOD AIN'T ALL THAT FOR ME TO HAVE TO GO OUT MY WAY FOR IT ! SINCE SHE HAD GOT ME ALL WET COMING TO TRY AND GET THE PIZZA I DECIDED TO GO TO VALARTA'S AND COOK ME A SCRUMPTIOUS DINNER WITH A GALLON OF WATER FOR MUCH LESS THAN 2 SMALL BOTTLES I WOULD HAVE PAID AND GOTTEN FROM HER HAD SHE DELIVERED AND NOT TRIED TO CHARGE EXTRA. I'M GOOD, NO MORE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ME I WILL STICK TO DOMINOS AND PIZZA HUT IF I WANT PIZZA AND WINGSTOP FOR WINGS SA-LA -VI !<//Review>

That was just warm, which is ridiculous   Considering I live less than 5 minutes away from the restaurant. Also I ordered garlic parmesan wings that had NO flavoring on it. The whole meal was awful and I rather eat regular Domino's. The positive point was the wings were very big and juicy. But still over all suck.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<rate>1< /rate><text>When we went it to get nails and feet done for prom, the nail tech was pretty rude until I explained to her that there was a better way to speak to people. The service cost over $100 dollars and the polish was chipped off of some toes and completely off of other toes within two days. We went back for repairs and only got the ties re-polished, no new Pedi and the service was horrible that day. We stood without being greeted until another unsatisfied customer was telling us her experience and to stop the exchange one of the nail techs came over and asked how she could help us...We will absolutely not be going back there. Over priced and terrible service.< /text>< date>

<review>My daughter and I came here for the first time today. I wish I would have paid attention to all the reviews I would have avoided coming here.

I got a fill and the guy did an ok job. My daughter got a full set. She showed the lady the picture of what she wanted. I felt I over paid for a poor service. My daughters  nails were crooked, bulky, poorly shaped, and her fingers were cut and bleeding. I was charged $95. The lady couldn’t do the 3D nail art so she just painted the flowers on.

I asked for her nails to be fixed by someone else. The lady saw we came back and offered to fix them. She brought my daughter back to her table and went through one of her nails with a file a few times and said she was done. I then asked to speak with owner and was left there waiting. My daughter and I walked out, never again will be coming to this place.<//review>< pics>

<review>Very rude and I received a sloppy pedicure. When I went back to get a refund the manager blamed me for the terrible job. She offered to have the same gal redo my nail polish. Why would I want the same person who did a terrible job the first time redo my nail polish? Just really rude.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Milano Nails Spa is an experience, not just another nail salon.
I have a great experience each time I visit their natural nail care salon. I'm always on the go, and HANA, TRACY and KATY are very accommodating with my appointment times.
I love her attention to detail and how attentive she is to her customers. The conversations are fun, and she is very efficient with the time used to paint my nails to perfection. People are often amazed how my strong, healthy and long my natural nails are. I recommend Milano Nails Spa to all my friends and associates.<//Review>

< Review>
Got $48 pedicure...Tech did not open tools in front of me and tray they were on was dirty. charged $10 for gel and another $10 for metallic powder rubbed into them...in my opinion, not clean and didnt do what pedicure listed, no file was use and edges were not smooth so my toenails caught on sheets at night, also didnt massage for 12 minutes(Larry was my tech) $68 bucks felt like a rip off. He cut out all the sides of my nails and three toes were super sore for days. I wont ever go back now.<//Review>

One of their male employees left the callus remover on my heels far too long. He used the grater too hard on the bottom of my feet. Not only was I cut real bad on my heels, I also got second degree burns. I couldn't walk for three days. Needless to say, I WILL NEVER go there again. Unprofessional!</text>

Best in the neighborhood. The ladies are nice and they always accommodate me. You should definitely make an appointment. Tell HANA, TRACY and KATY you heard great things and they'll take care of you. Bring cash for your tip!<//Review>

We all know nail salons. They do the most to convince you to get gel an upsell. Act like they don't understand you when you tell them no thank you. Still charge you for more than what you wanted. So I left here paying for a $70 manicure for my 10 year old daughter because I didn't want to embarrass myself telling this guy for the third time to cut them short. Still made them long. My oldest daughter got a manicure with white tips. The lady hurt her multiple times.<//Text>

Leo did a great job on my nails I got new cofin set with regular nail polish $40. Larry did the worst pedicure he kept pushing it to get the most expensive pedi after telling him I wanted  the regular he began to throw stuff and breath heavily. This pedi was honestly the worst he finished in 15minutes and nearly  scrubbed  my feet now i have to go elsewhere for pedis.. Hanna did my eyelash that were $55 they look super cute lets see how long they last</review>

Made appointments twice for Lee when Arriving  he was just starting with another person with a new set first time I was pushed off on someone else second time today I waited 25 minutes he was still working on the other person will not return to this business. I was in beauty Business over 40 years you don’t make an appointment for someone and then start another person or at least come over and tell the person that has the appointment you’re sorry you’re running late have some decency don’t just be ignoring your clients</review>

My daughters toe ended up getting infected after getting a pedicure here. I also ended up having to go home and refile my nails because they were left very lumpy, I asked for ombre nails and they must have send me somebody who's barely learning how to do it cuz my nails came out s*****. she didn't even send me to go wash my hands so I was left with acrylic and gel all over my fingers. I will not go back the place looks nice but the service is terrible.that the gentleman who did my my toenails and my pedicure did an amazing job and he was only friendly person in there.<//review>

Tracy was my technician and she was such a sweetheart. I highly recommend her. She didn't rush through my manicure or pedicure. Very meticulous & took her time which I appreciated. My toes look alive and well again lol!!! Overall my experience here was incredible and I will be a repeat customer. Thank you guys !!< /review>< pics>

<Review>Had my wife take my mom and daughters. I hear this was a horrible expensive experience. They were rude and over charge just based on size.  the work is poor quality as the little gems and gels they charge extra for fell off on some the same night. Do not send your loved ones here. There is better places in town.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I've been coming here for about 6 months. But, today I had to post! I came later tonight, hoping to get in, even though I didn't have an appointment. KATY gladly let me in, without hesitation, and took her time to make sure everything was right! I am so thankful!!
KATY has done my mother-in-law and I's nails. She is PHENOMENAL! She always remembers me, and asks about my son! It seems small, but those little things matter!
It does cost a little much, but what she offers, is worth every penny! You won't regret going here!< /review>

Took a friend to this place to get her nails done. The nail tech ends up cutting her finger and not knowing any English to help her stop the cut from bleeding. We called the ambulance and a police officer to file a report and their staff was no help. Very unprofessional and not safe.< /Text>

I found this salon based off a friend's recommendation and was extremely happy with my experience. My nail tech was friendly and diligent. The salon was extremely clean. I am very picky with nail salons and this place exceeded my expectations. I got a regular pedicure, which was pretty standard. I also got a powder dip manicure with extensions. It turned out really pretty and they're not clunky/thick like some powder nails look. Tracy did a good shaving down the powder to look more natural.  Will definitely be returning.</review>

I moved here about a year ago and somehow stumbled upon this nail salon. I have been going to TRACY ever since. She is THE BEST! Recently, I went back after months (thanks, COVID-19) and she knew exactly what I wanted without me saying a word. She is so good at what she does and will make sure you leave looking and feeling 1000%.</Text>

<Text>This is an amazing place! The place was very clean and well cared for.The services are wonderful and the staff is great, very professional. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming here. Tracy was my nail tech and she was amazing! The last few times I got my nails done elsewhere it sometimes felt like they weren't really registering what I wanted all the way. Tracy was funny, informative, and most importantly, attentive. She would pause every now and then to not only check on my overall nails herself but to also ask for my opinion on how everything looked so far. If I had a concern about something, she would agree and fix it right away! I love the end results! I'm very satisfied, so great! I will continue to come back.<//Text>< pics>

If you want the best quality for the best price I highly recommend heavenly nails. Such friendly staff and great craft. They were so sweet even though I came in near closing they were accommodating and made me feel welcomed. I schedule for Tracy and she was amazing she took her time with my nails. I'm well satisfied with her work . I'll be back soon to get my toes and or my graduation nails done.</text>

What an amazing group of talented and hard working women. I'm so lucky that I work just around the corner from this gem, because I love nothing more than having perfect almond-shaped nails. They are SO good at shaping. I always look forward to coming here and relaxing. Thank you all so much for making me feel beautiful and cared for! Kind staff, quality work, affordable prices.< /Text>

THIS PLACE LIVES UP. Clearly under awesome management and caring staff. Spa quality, change your standard of mani pedi services here. I had TRACY for my dip French mani. She was efficient and focused, she gave a ton of care with a hand scrub, hand massage, and hot towels - plus a heated back rub while they dried was above & beyond. Also got the Energizing pedicure, with minty bath and callus treatment with KATY. YES. My feet are softer than ever. She put such hard work in on my polish & massage. This place has a new loyal customer in me. 10/10<//text>

Went in today for a pedicure, because of Covid 19 it had to be done outside.  I understand that be cause I work in the beauty industry also.  However, they decided because they are outside and it is hot they are going to charge more.  No extra services are available water cold,and after service the water used is being dumped in the flower bed.  sad to see their new motto is "do
less charge more." If callus remover can't be used and you are changing more not scrubbing should not be an option. Will not be going back< /text>

Way way over priced. Got a fill this morning and she charged me 50 bucks. Nothing extra nothing special just a fill. And didn’t even do that great of a job. I’ve had wayyy better for 1/2 the price. I told her I would NOT be back. We’re not in Beverly Hills we’re in Hemet for crying out loud< /Review>

<Review>This nail shop is straight a mess, why? My appointment was at 1:00 p.m. but did not get seen until almost 20 after. Then the lady half did the bottom of my feet, to point I did the bottom of my own feet. My feet are not bad at all because I pretty much take good care of them and home.Next, my massage chair did not work so I complained to the lady Tina who was in charge. I told her that I should get a discount and she refused. I feel the service was in professional, and quality was very poor. I am not going back there or refer anyone to them. I honestly don’t think they deserve a one star< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><UserId.>116499184372736984196</UserId.><Gmap_id>0x80db65e18208146b:0xb9c15a37f5dc6dac< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Milano Nails Spa is THE place to get manis and pedis. TRACY, and KATY take their time and are very attentive to my nails, cuticles, and feet. They did such a great cherry blossom color on my hands and everyone complimented me on the nails and mani for days, and for my boyfriend's law prom they did my hands (french mani) and dark blue for my toes to match my dress. I showed TRACY a picture and she picked the best color and it definitely worked! Their shop is clean and tidy, their chairs are comfortable, and they are very nice to me.< /review><rating>5</rating><time>1605027423171</time><Gmap_id>0x80db65e18208146b:0xb9c15a37f5dc6dac</Gmap_id>< Name>

<text>I got a gel manicure here over two weeks ago and it still looks amazing! They painted all the way down to the cuticle so they've lasted much longer than other manicures I've had in the past. . The ladies who took care of me were super nice and accommodating and on top of that, the prices were very reasonable for the service I was getting. Would definitely return!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Love how there are so many choices of colors/style/designs and how she's willing to listen to how you want your nails done (even tweak it to something better or suggest ideas) Details and quality is everything, even felt comfortable yet strong. I really feel like this is the only salon in town that fit my taste, thank you for welcoming me!</text></record>

It lasted for 2 weeks before it peeled a little but I waited until week 3 to have them removed because they still looked pretty good.
My normal pedicure lasted 3 weeks before chipping. Looking forward to returning!!</text>< pics>

I found Milano Nails on Google. Technician pays attention to detail.  She asked if I wanted my cuticles cut (which I don't, but no one has ever asked), was very patient and helpful while I chose a polish, and is pleasant to have a conversation with.  I'll be hard pressed to go back to a "nail shop" now that I know Milano Nails.< /Review>

Milano Nails has a large colour section for all of your mani/pedi requirements along with attentive staff who will ensure that your nails look astonishingly beautiful and healthy before you leave the salon. This has been my fifth visit to Milano Nails and I am pleased to say that I have located a salon that I can fully trust to take care of all of my nail care needs.

<text>This was my first and last time coming to this establishment.... The guy at the desk "receptionist" was rude and rushing me to sign the book.  Without being asked, they were putting gel on my toenails and trying to charge me extra $10. I paid $50 for a manicure / pedicure, no gel and a very fast sloppy job the worst one I have ever had some nails were square...some round. Never again! What a joke!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80db65e18208146b:0xb9c15a37f5dc6dac<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I have come here for about a year and a half I absolutely love it here. Tracy and Jenny are by far the best ever!!! If you want a great pedicure ask for Tracy and nails ask for Jenny. They are respectful and just so sweet. Every time I come I feel at home. All the staff has always been so pleasant.<//review>

I had a great mani/pedi today. This place is clean and convenient. Was in and out quickly and my nails look perfect. Everyone is so friendly and professional and the space is clean and has lovely decor. They also have the best playlist of relaxing love songs! Would highly recommend this place! Will return soon!<//Review>

I went here about 6 months ago to get a full set of regular not gel nails that they advertised on their banner as being a $19 Special. The girl argued with me for 15 minutes trying to make me get gel nails instead because it would make her more $. Then when I refused she huffed and puffed gave me a very bad set of regular acrylic nails. I will not return!<//Text>

Happy with my pedicure today. Eric was the technician and he's very sweet. I got the pedicure with hot towels and Sea salt scrub. Very relaxing. This is only the second time I've been to this salon and my second visit was better than the first. My pedicure is perfect! Thank you, Eric!</review>

Was serviced by Heidi she rushed towards the end but over all she did good. Customer service was decent & price was a little higher than expected. However, She did what I asked, short natural look with sparkle.<//Text>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>I had my nails done the last week of May and was rushed in to have nails and pedicure that ended up not matching color.  This was my first time there experience. The full set color was done by new technique by dipping each finger into a powder by Tracy. I told her I wanted toes color to match which they were done in gel color. They never matched color of hands and toes. She had a attitude because I told her the color was not the same as toes. One week and 1/2 goes by and my tip on my thumb broke off and then I jammed another nail on my left hand so I went back to get two repairs.  When I went in I showed them what I needed and they couldn’t even find the color that they used on my hands. It took six different people to figure it out and told me that I should remember the color and who did them the first time and tried to tell me to have a fill on all fingers for $30. I said no I only need two repairs. It was only $10 for repairs. They asked Tracy what color she used and she had a rude tone and attitude in Pilipino language. Then I was asked to look through all of the powder colors to find the right one. In the mean time that gal left just took off!  I said it isn’t my fault because you can’t find the right color. They finally found the original one used and did repairs. Then the gal got half way finished and got up and said “my client is here for me to do her nails”. Then she had one of the males come finish my repair and left me hanging!  I have never seen such rudeness and unprofessional people who treat customers in such a manner. I then asked the male to get me the Manager. Of course he went back to the back of the room and came back and said she already left. Right!  So hence this review to warn others about the rudeness and poor service. I will not be back.</Review>< pics>

I made an appointment to get my eyelashes done. I showed up to my appointment right on time and I noticed she was already starting someone else’s eyelashes. I let her know I was here for my 11:00 appointment and she told me no you are late I have you for 10:30. She then told me I will have to come back later. I had my appointment time written down and it was 11.  When I came back later the lady she was working on was still there and I was overhearing them talking. It turns out that they know each other. She took her on my appointment time and lied to me saying my appointment was supposed to be at 10:30.<//Text>

I just got my nails done today and it looks like I need a fill already. I told the guy my nails looked like they were missing acrylic and he did nothing to rectify this situation. I would not ever get my nails done here again.<//Review>

The pedicure was supposed to include a 5 minute massage which never happened. I did tip because she was hovering right after taking my card. Didn’t even offer time under a dryer.

I went to get black cat eye. My nails came out a burgundy/pink color. I didn't have time to wait for them to fix it, as I was on time. Fast forward a week or 2 later and my nail starts chipping. Next thing I know, my whole nail comes off at work. I will be choosing a different nail salon.< /text>

<Review>I've gone here a handful of times and can honestly say I've loved my nails twice. These were the 2 times they did a good job and didn't over charge me. This last time they had a slow day and jenny did my nails and charged me $60 for chrome, coffin shape and kinda long nails. I was like seriously? Why so much if I've gotten charged no more than $50 for the same in other occasions? And my pedi was good until whoever the lady was started painting. My 6 year old niece could've done a better job. Plus they're jerks. They charge properly when they're in a good mood.<//Review><userid>113352628030006500110</userid><Rating>1< /Rating><gmap_id>0x80db65e18208146b:0xb9c15a37f5dc6dac< /gmap_id><resp>None<//resp><date>1547324657152<//date><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user_name>

<text>I love how they do my nails! Natural and thin. I will say they do overcharge for a fill: $55 for gel fill.  But I liked it so much I didn't mind.  Other places do my nails too thick and bulky. Jen Is great and listens to what I want. But yes, I'm used to paying 35 or 25 for a fill.  So 55 is more but you get what you pay for.  I recommend it! *Pedicure was mediocre, massage was good but the scrub and cuticle removal was sub Parr to say the least.</text>< response>

Everything was fine at first very friendly I absolutely recommend Ven and Sofia. But now I brought my mother and they are charging me for everything. My mom made a mistake I’m her color of choosing and right before they even opened the nail polish they charged her $5 because of a mistake. She asked for a regular pedicure and they gave her a $24 one and she even said that she only wanted the $20 and they kept saying that she wanted the $24 one. What I’m the world?!! I’m definitely not coming back here.<//Text>

<Text>Bad experience, Had my nails done Friday and on Monday one had already broke, went in to get it fixed they told me to wait for the lady who did it so it was free. I waited 30 min and still got charged $5, didn’t even fully remove the broken nail just slapped a tip on didn’t cut the broken nail didn’t match the same shape I had them. Managers daughter didn’t even know why they charged she was the one who told me to wait for her, told me it was because it was gel after the nail tech Jenny told her how much. I get my nails done every 2 weeks and I hadn’t Had a experience like this. Such a run around Will never be going there again<//Text>< Pictures>

I love getting my eyebrows done here by hannah. I thought I'd come back and get my feet done too, but the survice was not great. It took them probably 15 minutes to do my feet. I was waiting for them to dry longer then I was getting them done. The place is really nice I expected a lot more then what I received. When they scrubbed the bottom of my feet they literally took less the 5 minutes in total to do both so I left and the bottom of my feet still looks like dead skin is still there.< /review>

I don’t ever really submit reviews but I gave this place a chance because of the few good reviews it had.. literally paid $50 for my nails and the tech kept asking me if they were all equal size and how they look if she should trim them more or file them and I’m just thinking aren’t I paying you to figure that out? That’s your job you shouldn’t have to ask me if your doing it right, I was so unhappy with my nails plus everyone was so unprofessional and kept talking in Vietnamese shouting from one to another across the nail salon the whole time I just wanted to get out of there. I had to repaint my own nails because you could see the glued on nails through the gel and I still have glue all over my fingers she only did one coat of polish and didn’t even take the time to clean up around my nails AND the ends of my nails weren’t even fully painted. I will never go back here again maybe if the nails came out good I would go back but I’d rather go back to my original nail place and pay the extra $20 because I know I’ll be happy with them.</text>

<Text>EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL,
I DON'T HAVE AN INCONVENIENCE PAYING FOR A HIGH END PEDICURE THAT INCLUDES CALLUS REMOVAL,,
I'VE BEEN TO OTHER PLACES AND THEY HAVE THE RIGHT GELS FOR A JOB WELL DONE
I ONLY RECIEVED A REGULAR PEDICURE....
WHEN I CALLED THEM, THEY ARE JUST GIVING ME STUPID EXCUSES,  LIKE IT TAKES TIME, YOU NEED MORE TREATMENTS, I KNOW EXACTLY HOW A CALLUS REMOVAL WORKS THEY MUST THINK IM STUPID
WHAT I AM IS UPSET WITH THEIR SERVICE

Just recently went in for Mani/ Pedicures they had used a dirty towl on me, very unfriendly. Maybe they feel unwelcomed themselves. Sadly with me being a nice person, i have a nail place i go to out here in hemet. But this onE THUMBS down Unfortunately,  It was horrible they painted my frineds toes a different color then her nails and just rolled thier eyes. & got my nails a whole diffrent color didnt give me what i wanted !!!! If they were friendly and caring about your nails.. They would get Edleast a 5 star. But i am sad to say 1st time i will NEVER NEVER COME AGIAN<//text>

<Text>Worst experience at a nail salon EVER! Which should tell you a whole lot. Inside the place is really cute and modern . However it doesn't make up for the horrible customer service and price. I went in for a fill and a spa pedicure.  $80. I never am one to complain about paying for something I want. However, they did such a horrible job I went to my normal place right after. I should have taken before and after photos.  Anyway I'm not the type of person to ever complain or leave a bad review but I just had to warn people . I usually go to HEMET NAILS . It is a small rustic place but the owner and her employees are so sweet and really  Take there time doing each nail to perfection.  They're the type of place that you go out of your way to tip them. $$ they're really cheap or reasonable prices . You get what you want. Just saying go ahead and try this place out if you want just remember you have been warned!< /Text>< Pics>

Paid extra for "spa pedicure" what a waste! Nothing special just a regular pedicure at an elevated price. And technician cut me the proceeded to pour acetone all over my cut toe😣. Fantastic colors and they try pressuring you to buy extra services. Gel, Gel Gel is their push even though I specifically said NO GEL. Needless to say this was a 30$ waste<//text>

I went in to get a gel manicure and regular pedicure. The guy told me to have a seat in one of the massage chairs. I sat there for about 30 minutes before anyone got to me. Then when they turned the water on I couldn’t even keep my feet in because it was so hot!!! They did not take the extra time to get the skin around my toes. Also, the guy who was doing my hands kept texting nonstop. I would not recommend this place they are unwelcoming and overpriced.</text>

I went to this nail salon to get the 15.00 pedi special eyebrow was also. The eyebrow wax was horrible very rough in a rush. Then Iam sat down in a pedi bowl to wait 20 min watching the employees just walk by speaking there language. Finally the tech comes by to do my pedi not one friendly questions just ask me if i wanted to spend 10.00 more dollars for the gel I said no thanks.  Its amazing to me how the nail techs expect a tip after they rush through and expect a tip. I will not tip if you cant be friendly to me say hi something.Try atlease. If i would have seen the three stars I would of kept 🚗. They also have a sign that says cash tips only.Goodluck with that.< /review>

Horrible experience. Paid for high end pedicure and was a regular pedicure then argued that it wasnt. Got a fill on acrylics and had to stop because of all the cuts on my fingers. 1st time here and that is the last. Do not go here it is horrible!</text>

< review>
DISSATISFIED!! Worst experience at a nail place ever. Over priced and they don't listen to the customer. I went in for a full set. One of my nails looked different than the others and when I pointed it out to her she tried to tell me it was my nail bed that was causing it to look that way. She then began to speak in Vietnamese to the other employees about it. She attempted to fix it and it looked worse. I called her out on it and then she had someone else there fix it.  Also failed to tell me that different shapes were more expensive and that gel was $10 more. If I would have gotten gel the full set would have been $40. Terrible customer experience and a rip off!!< /review>

Don’t waste your time going here unless you want fast and messy work done . This is the second time they have ripped me off. They act like your getting special deal on the spa packages , twice I’ve paid for a massage and have had to call them out on incomplete pedicure package and first time the lady said ok after I called her out and massaged my feet after she had painted my nails ect, second time the guy denied it and said he did , the lady sitting next to me was like no he didn’t.
I called in advance and asked for Van to do my nails and they agreed and when I got their a lady argued to do my nails and had Van do someone else’s pedicure . She did my nails and my daughter could have done better. My nails are uneven, and thick and not filed they look like bricks, and the paint is blotched . When I mentioned it they said it was fine and told me to pay.  Then the person that did my pedicure literally stopped doing my pedicure and started someone else’s and had me waiting cold wraps on my feet when I asked how much longer he has someone rake them off and have me pay without even finishing . I will never go back there. If You want a good quality service I recommend Nail Heaven .< /text>

<text>I made the mistake of buying a full set of new nails here and paid 50$. I’ve gone to different places before but never have I experienced something like this. Within one week two of my nails popped off..I’ve never had this happen before on a new set and I’ve gotten my nails done at different places for years. Then when I requested that they fix them free of charge they were rude and when I asked them to make them shorter as I did before the man made them completely uneven. I thought this place would be nice because of its appearance but looks are deceiving.. girls beware</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80db65e18208146b:0xb9c15a37f5dc6dac< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I'm reading some of these reviews and just do not agree. The whole experiance was wonderful. I highly recomend coming here. Annie was wonderful both with my nails and her overall professionalism. I went on a busy day and still got exceptional service. One of the ladies even held her clients baby while she went to the bathroom.</Text>

<Time>1515467889944<//Time><text>Im sorry but had to leave this review. Save yourself a ton of money and find somewhere else. In short they do NOT listen to the request of the customer. I went for a pedi paid extra for callous removal and came home with feet not feeling much different. Got my daughter what I THOUGHT was going to be a gel manicure... THEY GAVE HER ACRYLICS!!!! I specifically told more than one person what I wanted her to have and at the end.. SHE SAID IT'S WHAT MY DAUGHTER REQUESTED!!! She doesn't even know what acrylics are!!! And last time I checked the parent and one who is paying is the one who says what her child gets!!! Was so disappointed</text>< username>

Pedicure i loved. She did an amazing job. But the lady who did my manicure😒 she cut me twice with the electric file after i told her she was hurting me. Told the guy upfront and just put some liquid on my finger which made it sting like crazy. She didnt clean my nail after just left me with the light on my hand. I didnt know if i was done or not. It was just ridiculous. Not even a week later my nails started to chip. Very upset</text>

<username>Joanna Baker< /username><Time>1506630477121<//Time><rating>1</rating><text>I have never left a review before. I hate to do it but going to this salon was a waste of money. The service was horrible, I got my nails done on Monday and one just popped off on Wensday. I went back in and the woman I spoke to was very rude and told me it would be a 30 minute wait just for the one nail that shouldn't have came off in 2 days. I could get past all of that but not the horrible customer service. If you go good luck and i really hope you have a better experience then I did. Update went back today because another nail came off. The owner was there and i asked if i could just get them taken off and refunded. He told me he won't refund me because who would refund him? This place really is a joke and they made me wait 40 mins for him just to say that. I work 3 jobs this couldn't have been more of a waste of time. I went to Hollywood nails and they apparently get a lot of their unhappy customers. Save the time and money.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I came in a while back for a full set. The employees basically begged me to get a pedicure. Since the wait was semi long I figured why not!? The man who did my pedicure completely screwed up my toes. He left my toe nails super short and uneven. I didn’t freak out too much since they were just my toes. When it came to my full set the lady made me get the magnetic gel polish with the swirls. They told me they had no other colors which I later on found out they did. I walked out of there paying almost $90 for a trash full set and pedi!<//Review>< Response>

I went here to get a pedicure and they sat me down in cold water I had to ask them twice that I wanted warm water. She cut me with the buffer and I told her I wanted my nails trimmed but she only filed them and didn't listen to me at that point I was over it. They clipped each side of my nail it hurt so bad that's how you get ingrown nails! My toe is still in so much pain and it's been 2 days they hacked up the side of my toe nail For no reason. There was no massage with the lotion she just put it on and wiped it off. And then when she put polish on she put it so thick it started dropping down the side of my toe . Then some kid ended up stepping on my toe so I asked her to take it off and re polish the toe but she flat out told me No! And just piled more polish on top it looks absolutely horrible! I will never go back there this place made me afraid of nail salons.< /Review>

<review>My wife had horrible experience.  She called made an appointment with certain nail technician and when she got there the woman in charge told her she double booked that person and someone was waiting in line for them too. My wife called ahead and asked for specific person because that's who she prefers.  They just get you in door hoping you'll settle with anyone and give them your money.  The boss was unapologetic and didnt seem to care. My wife will not ever go back to Milanos nail salon.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80db65e18208146b:0xb9c15a37f5dc6dac</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<rating>1<//rating><review>WORST NAIL SHOP I EVER BEEN TO . Set a appointment day before  ask when i set the appointment can i get a full set and a
pedicure at the same time. I was told no problem arrived at 9 shop wasn't opened . Wait until 920 shop finally open sit down to start my pedicure  3 white women walked in all of sudden I wait to get my pedicure done and i now I can't get both service done at once even tho it was ok over the phone and when i arrived. . They had no remorse they were  clearly begin racist.. Even the ladies that walked in after me was sayin she was here first . In all my years getting my nails done I never cussed the staff out and walked out.. I wouldn't referral them to anyone however if you are looking for a good nail shop in hemet check out Annie's nail salon off Devonshire and Sanderson.  Best prices in town great quality your nail will  last for a long time..< /review>< pictures>

<Text>Let me start by saying I don't mind paying for good service. I went here with my daughter she's 5 we went in to get a pedicure. She's gotten plenty of pedicures before so have I. Thenemployess were yelling across the whole place at each other it wasn't crowded yet i felt extremely rushed. And thenlady kept asking me if I wantedngel on mine And my daughters toes. I have never gotten gel on my toes and they'd have been fine but the lady Said if you don't gdt gel polish will .Be ruined from shoes. Every place I've ever been lets your toes dey before putting your shoes on. Nope this place she put the sandel they provided on and it smuged my big toes on both feet. Idk the whole vibe was off there if I'm gonna pay what i paid if want to go somewhere where I'm relaxed this place IS not it.< /Text>< Pictures>

Ling Ling was aggressive,wasn't focused on what she was doing (her eyes kept wandering around the room), and overpriced. My sister got hers done and it was 55$ and she was saying she did a very good job and they looked nice and the lady dropped it to 45$ ...smh these people are aren't going to get costumers and good reviews if they keep charging over priced with not good quality nails or just anything in general< /Text>

Okay so I went in today because my regular nail tech was booked on appointments so I just wanted to get my nails done for a gift for myself and like they had me waiting 40 whole minutes and was just walking pass me and eating and stuff and one person just tossed the nail stencils at me to pick a color. Like I’m a human not a dog. Then the guy who did my nails kept on pushing me to to get GEL I said no 5x and he kept on and like everytime i said no he would get really rough with me like filing my nails rough and everything I have bleeding cut because he filed my skin too much. Then he got mad because I said no tip. I thought a full set was $19! Not $28. Uhh I wish I could them zero stars. 🙄< /text>

I told the lady they weren’t shape the way I wanted she told me when she was done they would look that way smh LIE! Then told me she couldn’t go back cuz she already put the gel polish on them .. so I decided to just deal! I do like the fact that all they use is gel & the guy that did my feet was nice ( that’s it ) so after I paid my high bill Nd tipped even tho I wasn’t happy ... BAM my nail broke the very next day so I go in there the following day to get it fixed and I’m telling them I was just there they look at me and tell me it’s gonna cost 5$ . After the money I just spent in here ain’t no way I should be getting charged and I was just here so this lady fixes it and she has an attitude the whole time and when she was done she couldn’t even dust off my hands from the ashes and STILL charged me 5$ smh I guess ima be driving all the way to upland like I been doing cuz this is unacceptable for these prices they are charging !< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

HORRIBLE PLACE ! I normally don’t leave a review but I had to for this nail salon the service was horrible & VERY UNSANITARY! I got a full set & pedicure the lady who did my pedicure cut me multiple times as I sat in the chair there was gnats flying around & the white chairs aren’t even white anymore. I got up & moved to a different side of the salon so they could do my nails & they didn’t clean the chair but had another guest sit down it in . The guy who did my nails did not listening to how I wanted them even after I kept telling him to fix it & now there messed up some of them are uneven & the gel polish is already chipping, I just got them done yesterday. I wasted $80 for my toes to hurt & horrible service & they mocked me In there language because I said he wasn’t doing my nails the right way  please save your time & money go somewhere else.<//review>

<Text>Worst Nail experience I've ever had!!! I paid 42 plus tip for a pedicure, They had the door open blowing the cold on me during the pedicure, when I asked them to close it they got mad. The man that did my pedicure pulled my ingrown toe nail out instead of clipping it out.Now my big toe looks like it has an infection! It hurts bad! He continued to work aggressively on my other foot causing it to bleed. Absolutely horrified! I never get to get my toes done, so I was very disappointed😖<//Text>< name>

<review>Bad place to come , came with my family of 7 and all came out terrible they didn’t even paint the whole nail half of the nail is gone had to wait about 3 hours payed 300$ for only 3 people for manicure and pedicure THIS IS BS. They have no respect and argue with you until you say they are correct it’s very crowded and they rush do your nails they come out HIDEOUS . The nail colors aren’t even accurate to the color you choose!.<//review>< pics>

Way too overpriced!!! My nails lifted within the next two days. Not worth what they charge! I wish I would’ve read the reviews before I went.<//Review>

<review>There are so many options within the Rec Cen facilities. They really do embody their motto of: Find Your Fit. Such options include: guitar classes, salsa classes, indoor rock climbing mountain, standard gym equipment, swimming pools with diving boards, multiple indoor and outdoor basketball courts, and much more.<//review>< pics>

Short hours, extended equipment downtime, many holidays, far too busy.
Cable machines break several times per year (cables fray) and it is not uncommon for a month or longer to pass before they are fixed. Often, both will be broken machines in the MAC will be broken simultaneously. The facility is far too small for the number of members, and it's not uncommon to wait 15-20 minutes for a barbell/squat rack/bench press. Hours are short (close at 9:00 PM on weekends, open at 6:30 AM on weekdays) and they are closed a large number of days out of the year.<//review>

<Text>Small and intimate dive bar.  Mostly a lot of blue-collar locals with weathered faces in there. Some just gaze at you with curiosity if you're an outsider. $10 minimum I believe for credit card. Liquor and beers is priced just right. Seems like a frequent hangout spot for a local motorcycle club.  Perfect for getting a quick beer after work.<//Text>< Date>

<Review>Ok, booze is stronger, they pour triples, they stay open till 4am, and drinks are 0.50 cents each... Can't go wrong with any binge drinking escapade.  Ok,  so I'm fibbing some... But for locals, this spot just works...and we'll.  They allow smoking, vaping,  and the bartender Derrick is on point.  It is a hit/miss on when it's busy/slow (unpredictable..no pattern discovered as of yet).  Come when Derrick works and you have a tender that makes the visit better than hoped for time in and time out.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I drive across the city to get it. But tonight was a bummer. I liked that they used a good amount of meat before. Tonight they hardly put any. For 10 I got a box of rice with little meat after years of coming here. So it won't be my last time coming but if next time I see the same then it won't be worth it for me anymore.</text>< pics>

It wasn't what I asked for but it was good, and they didn't clean the shrimp. I also received 1 onion ring,  1 carrot, and a mystery vegetable.<//text>

Super small storefront but super food. Great bowls, but was surprised by the California Roll ($4.25) which was generous and perfectly created, plus the side of Teriyaki Chicken ($3,75) - which was also generous and perfect in every way. If you are in the 'hood - drop in for great food at a great price and generous proportions. No wonder it was busy on a Weds night @ 8 pm !!!< /review>

Got the Yogi plate. Beef chicken shrimp over rice with vinegret salad. Side of avocado. Was not thrilled with the beef portion. Seemed over marinated like teriyaki jerky. But the rest was good.</text>

I'm sure there food would be as good as any other Yogis but this place uses CHEAP black Styrofoam containers that leaked flavours into my food. When I called to let them know about the Styrofoam taste they were very nice and offered a refund but I was unable to collect because of my short lunch break. i believe the workers are doing a great job but the management NEEDS to get containers that are better quality. For the record I still eat Yogis just not from this location.

TL;DR: the people are friendly but beware of the black Styrofoam containers< /review>

I loved going here even there beef is different. It use to melt in your mouth now it seems tuff and it was harder to chew.  I will give them one more try but if I get the same results I will not be going there anymore.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dd29979a70cd89:0xf2b6ab219cc3e0c0</Gmap_id></record>

Smaller portions of chicken and beef plate with a side of ornges and a mini salad, and upped the price by $2 or $3.
Not a bad thing but not what i personally was looking for when going back to that place from a year ago.</text>< user>

This place is under new management now and you can tell. From the dry meats to the watered down teriyaki sauce, the new owner sure doesn't care for quality. It is a damn shame because this was the go to spot. Never again.< /review>

When I entered this small store at 7:30pm on a Sunday evening it was busy.  The few tables that were inside were all occupied and several people were ahead of me who had already ordered. The girl behind the counter was dealing with and assembling multiple orders yet I was surprised that she turned around for a moment to acknowledge me with a smile letting me know she would be with me.  Then two cooks behind the counter in the kitchen who looked like twins or at least brothers both made eye contact with me and also gave me smiles.   After placing my order with the girl, I stood to the side by the trash bin next to the entry into the kitchen. An older gentleman who looked like he may have been the owner or at least a manager invited me with a smile to sit down at a table while I wait.  Total wait time was around 10 minutes when I finally got my food which I took to go.  I ordered a large chicken beef veggie combo. I thought it was delicious.  The chicken was tender, the beef was flavorful, the rice was soft and sticky with no hard under-cooked pieces and the veggies were plentiful which included cabbage, carrots, and broccoli. They offered extra sauces for free which included teriyaki, Louisiana, and chili as well as other condiments like ginger, jalapenos, and green onions.  For the price and what is offered, especially considering the free condiments, it's a good value. No it's not dirt cheap but this is 2017 folks, you're not going to find cheap food when eating out anymore.
I got my food in the large black container and tasted no residual flavors as one reviewer complained.
This was my first visit and I will definitely be visiting again.</Text>

< Review>
Chicken and beef bowl with med drink combo came to $7.81. Meat is quite delicious, saddened to find that my bowl is literally full to brim with rice and very small portion of meat. No veggies or garnished on this bowl. Added green onion and couple jalapenos with teryaki sauce and siracha from to counter accessible over small bar seating.. more for my money many other places semi locally. Small, ate around 1pm and was really tight in there. Some seating. Not sure I'll return< /Review>

Ok service, they give you one knapkin and no tray to eat on, lots of flies and ants.  The portion is ok but I think its priced high.  Not a lot of dinning space</text>

Was in on Sunday around 740 close at eight seemed hurried out food wasn't that great they don't serve a tereyaki tempura combo had to order ala carte would not fly at a real Japanese food place rice too dry or old chicken dry should have went to flame broiler for wood like chicken and only served under cooked tempura carrots and broccoli no variety on tempura served waisted time and money</review>

<Response>None</Response><Text>This skatepark had a great set-up, with a couple of bowls, lots of rails, a huge area around the entire park for riding. Also, there is a cool area built for beginners with a miniature bowl and tabletop. Caution! If you are bringing little kids, stay with them. They can get seriously injured if they get in the way of the more experienced skaters. BMX bikes and scooters are welcome. There are specific rules for using the park during Covid-19, but no one was following them.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmap_id>

<Text>Packed with people. The fencing needs to be pushed back for a bigger dynamic Apprentice or make another skate park. The fencing adjustment would be a cheaper fix.< /Text><Rate>4<//Rate><userid>114188638228539208762<//userid><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I had a great experience. Bryan & Kevin did an amazing job. They were professional, courteous & efficient. Best money I spend on this type of haul. I will definitely use them again and specifically ask for Bryan & Kevin. Highly recommended.<//Review>

<Text>5 star service all around. I contacted Junk King earlier this week for same day junk removal in my back yard. After finishing a lot of construction in the house, I needed the debris and scrap metal removed from the site along with some small furniture haul away. The two-man team was fast, helpful and friendly throughout! Definitely recommended for any junk or appliance removal. Thanks so much.<//Text><Name>Andy Stone<//Name>< resp>

Glad we could help!'}</response><Text>I really glad I found Junk King on my search for Christmas tree removal.  I was able to call and get a very reasonable and affordable quote.  I was scheduled for pick up and removal that same day.  Fernando called a few hours ahead of schedule and offered to stop by earlier than scheduled.  They came in and removed the tree from the reusable base, swept and hauled the tree away.  It was quick, efficient, and highly professional.  Pictures were taken before and after removal and were sent to me in an email with a receipt.  I will definitely use Junk King again.  Did I mentioned how reasonable their quote was... so much so, that I doubled it with their tip.  Thank you for a professional and outstanding clean up.</Text>< Name>

Angello and Luis were awesome! I scheduled an appointment this morning for the afternoon but they called me to let me know they could get me in sooner if I wanted. They arrived on time and we're very professional, safe, and courteous. They were able to work within my budget which I greatly appreciated! It meant we were able to do the removal today at opposed to having to wait a bit longer. We've got a couple more projects we'll probably need removal for down the road and we'll absolutely use their services again! Thank you both for making this so fast and easy.< /Text>

<Text>Lee was my rep that came to the house. After I showed him what I wanted taken, he walked me through the pricing and made sure I understood and was good with it. I added an old cast iron bathtub that had been sitting in my backyard for years! He said “If we can lift it, we can take it.” And they did! The whole load out only took about 45 minutes....and now I have my yard back. I’m so happy with the entire process from online booking to completion. I will use them again 100%! Thank you Lee!<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>These guys were amazing. They called 30 minutes before showing up, and then two guys showed up and quickly removed my pile of junk. This is the first time I’ve used a junk removal company and it was a great experience. I highly recommend this company! They even cleaned up the area where my junk had been piled!

<Text>Angelo and Victor were fantastic! They were professional, polite, prompt, and provided superior customer service. I was informed of their status prior to arrival and they arrived as promised within my timeframe. As a person with over 25 years of customer service and management experience, if you are looking for a reliable and respectful company to handle your removal of unwanted items, I would highly recommend Junk King.< /Text>< pics>

Those guys are awesome. They were on time, very responsive and very accommodating. They removed our cal king bed and frame. Although it’s not mentioned in the list, they removed the existing trash also which is stuck under the bed. Very good pricing. Will definitely hire them again.</Review>

Junk Kings team came out to our house 2 hours early from our scheduled time after calling to confirm they could. They were very quick and professional even though they had to take 2 trips. Once I have re-cluttered my house again I will be calling once again. Extremely reasonable prices and they work with you if your on a budget. Thank you for all your hard work and keep it up< /Text>

<Text>I shopped around and looked at local competitors. Not only did they match their pricing, they were faster to respond, and were able to get all of my junk off the property in less than five minutes. Special shout out to CJ and Eddie for being absolute professionals and taking care of my specific needs as their customer.

I will definitely use them again for all my hauling needs.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I cannot say enough good things about the crew from Junk King that came out to my house today. Charley, on the phone setting the appt, Cristian R and Luis Rodriquez Avila, the actual crew onsite were great. They were friendly, polite, respectful, helpful, and they worked hard, from beginning to end. They cleaned up the mess, left everything in tip top order. When they left, it felt like I was bidding farewell to old friends. I would definitely use Junk King again and if I could, I'd request the same crew. In fact, I AM using them again and they ARE coming back tomorrow to work on another project. Great job, guys.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1617294934552, 'text': 'Thank you again Bob!

Excellent job by Junk King! Christian and Victor were right on time and they did an excellent job removing the junk off my property. They were very professional and even took the time to clean up the areas after they had removed the junk. The price was very reasonable as well. Will definitely use Junk King in the future, highly recommend.< /Text>

The phone operator was wonderful. Her name was Érica. She listened to my budget needs and negotiated with me which I am so grateful for! I spent a lil more but than I wanted to but it was due to tip at pick up. The guys were very efficient. They came in and were gone in less than ten minutes.</Review>

It was so easy to get rid of my couch, I don't know why I didn't do it earlier! Lee and Luis got here right at the beginning of my time block and were in and out within 15 minutes. Very professional, no scratches or dings. Let me know about the resale store they offer in case I need to replace my couch! Definitely recommend and will use again.< /Review>

I called Junk King in the morning for the removal of a wall air conditioner unit. They came out that very afternoon. They are fast and affordable!<//Text>

<Review>These guys are freaking AMAZING!
Kevin and Lee were fast, professional, extremely helpful, courteous and HARD WORKING!  I was amazed at how quickly and efficiently they had the work finished! I have more to be cleaned out and I will be giving them a call back and requesting these two again!
Thank you so much!< /Review><time>1605998249975<//time>< user_name>

The guys were on time, professional, and extremely efficient. The price was way more competitive than the last place I used. They took everything (we had a lot of stuff) and were gone within half an hour. I will absolutely be using them again in the near future. Highly recommend Junk King in San Diego!!</text>

The service providers Mikey and Christian were great, polite, friendly and professional.  They arrived on time and actually early within the window they gave. They were to arrive between 8-10, they came at 8:40. They called ahead to let me know they were on the way. They move the items quickly and efficiently. The price was a little higher than I expected, but not astronomically high.<//review>

The young men were respectful, helpful, efficient and considerate of my needs and time, I could not have asked for better. My only concern is the lack of the company payment method, which was offline at the time, but considering the crew I had a little respect goes a long way. Thank You<//text>

Charlie, whom I had the pleasure of speaking with, was clear and concise with how their company works. As a first time customer, I knew with the knowledge he imparted on to me, along with the 4.9 star average rating with a whopping 866 reviews I saw online, that this was the company I would have my business with. And they are a pickup and go kind of deal so why not!? When it was time for my appointment, I was greeted with welcome by Mikey and Dallas. Friendly dudes I'll tell you what! They handled the business in quick succession and I'm glad I got to know them. I highly recommend them and for the next time I have more items to let go.
Word of advice: Offer the pickup crew some water. That would really help them out.</Review>

I missed my original time slot, and they rearranged their schedule so they could come back at a different time the same day which was amazing.. then when they came back I had locked myself out of my house and had to wait for my husband to come unlock the door in order for me to get my card to pay them for their service, they were extremely nice, and gave me my quote in which they gave me a major discount!! loaded up all the furniture I was getting rid of and proceeded to be nice enough to wait for me to be able to get back inside my house so I could pay them. Luis and Caleb were very respectful, timely, and cooperative even after everything. I will definitely be recommending not only Junk King but both Caleb and Luis!< /Review>

<review>Kevin and James were wonderful. They were early, which was great because I needed to make an unexpected errand before 3pm, and were very polite. Received a much lower estimate than I expected also. As usual, which is awesome, they cleaned up after themselves before leaving. I've used this company three times and have been very impressed each time. Highly recommend.<//review>< Pics>

I would highly recommend this service. We needed a last minute junk/trash removal to clean up what was leftover from moving out of my parents home. I was able to book an appointment online within 24hrs. The Customer service rep Rachel helped answer any questions I had and gave me a great expectation of what the removal would cost.
Although I had scheduled the appointment for 10am-12pm, I was contacted around 11am that the guys were running late, but would still be able to come that day. They gave a new ETA of 2pm and Angelo, Luis, and Emillio arrived at the new time mentioned. Luis gave a heads up as they were on their way and was very responsive in the expectation that they would be able to take everything we had. They were a huge help, incredibly professional and because they ran late charged us for the removal at a discount. The price itself was also very reasonable considering all of the furniture, trash and miscellaneous stuff we had to get rid of.< /Text>

<text>Called several junk removal companies, wasn’t able to get through(broken phone line, voicemail etc.) to any except Junk King. The girl on the phone was nice and the whole thing was easy to setup. Justin the pickup guy was very nice and professional on the phone. Would definitely recommend and hire again if I need junk removed!!</text><resp>{'time': 1608567530504, 'text': 'Thanks Francesca for the recommendation!

I had Kevin from Junk King come out to give me a quote. He was personable and gave me a more-than-fair estimate, but a great value compared to their competitors. I hired him and 2 days later they came during their scheduled two-hour window.
Kevin and Luis hauled my couches, backyard grills, ~50 potted plants, electronic appliances, drywall/wood, coffe table, desk, etc. It’s so relieving to have loads of junk taken away and starting over. Thank you to Kevin and his team for making swift work with no hassles. Not sure if everyone else at Junk King is as easy to work with, but I recommend him. Would 100% use them again, but with all the junk they took I don’t think I’ll need to!< /text>

My Junk King team had an emergency so were unable to come on time. However I was called twice to let me know the status of their arrival time which I feel was very professional. When they did arrive they removed my items quickly and safely with no damage to my property. They were very personable and efficient and I will certainly use them (Lee, James and Justin) again. Thank you for your help!!<//review>

This was our first time using Junk King but it will not be our last!  Everyone I spoke with was kind, quick, and professional.   Their communication game is top notch.   I'm a customer who likes to know if there are changes,  if they may be late ( they were NOT late at all), and verbal confirmations the day of are very appreciated.  This level of customer service comes from hiring, training, and keeping good employees.  Of course the clean up went super quick and it was all finished in  about 15 minutes.  They measure cost by volume, so if you can tetris your stuff in a neat pile, they will be able to give you a very reasonable price....considering the alternative of packing it,  driving it to the city dump, unloading it, and paying for it...this was WELL worth the cost.  Thank you, Junk King!!< /text>

<review>Joseph and James hauled my junk for me. I recently moved from an apartment to a new home and decided to leave all of my old furniture behind. Joseph and James were very efficient, strong, and communicative. I appreciate the fact that they are licensed and bonded. You can’t say that for many of the people in this industry. I would highly recommend them for all of your junk hauling needs.< /review><user_name>Tanisha Denham</user_name></record></dataset><record>

Caleb and Kevin were awesome!  Five stars all the way!  I had furniture I needed removed right away and they came right out and worked with my budget.  They were super friendly and took everything I needed removed.  I highly recommend Junk King San Diego and especially make sure to ask for Caleb and Kevin.  They will take care of you!  I will definitely use them again in the future!< /Text>

Called CJ and he gave us a great quote on picking up 3 large couches. Other places wanted 100 per couch. Guys came the next day grabbed the stuff, easy and safe. Chris  and CJ were  very friendly and even offered to take other stuff for free! I will use them every time I have large items to be disposed, you should too.</text>

Junk King employees:  CJ, Benjamin, Lee and Mikey provided great customer service for a reasonable price.  Communication from start to finish was awesome - from making the appointment,  confirming the appointment and keeping the time.  The guys even cleaned up afterwards- I love the extra above and beyond effort!  I would definitely use them again (hopefully not any time soon - that means I accumulated some more junk!). I highly recommend them, too.</Text>

Junk King was responsive and gave me a quote, however I declined their services as I had received a quote for less.  Upon consulting with their manager, they were able to beat the price i was quoted at from another company, so I went with them instead! The staff who picked up my items were communicative, professional, and quick! It was a hot day and they hustled to get the job done quickly.  I would definitely use them again and recommend to others!< /Text>< Pics>

CJ and Angela were absolutely great! Very nice guys, cleaned up the site after they took my junk away. Nice dispositions (I hesitate to say “sweet“ because they were, after all, big strong guys), Wore face covering (although, for me, they didn’t have to). I recommend Junk King to anyone who needs to get rid of anything!</text>

Both Dallas and Mikey were so friendly, quick and professional! They were on time with the pick up and even went beyond to grab additional junk that I didn’t initially intended to have them take. It was trash day in my neighborhood and they gladly loaded up extra waste along with my order.

Would recommend anytime!< /review>

Junk king was very professional and did an outstanding job doing the pick up. The price was great and Ely was great about calling in advance and then giving me a second call to let me know when they were on their way. I would use Junk King again.</review>

Kevin and Lee just left our home to remove stuff from backyard and garage.  Very courteous gentlemen, love dogs (which is always a plus for us!), insightful and offered great advice.  Thank you, Kevin & Lee!!

In general, super quick, easy, and straightforward process from beginning to end.  Used texting method to send pics of stuff and made an appointment for 2 days after.  Staff came over to assess and provided price estimate; we liked it and had them remove right away.  Pricing is based on space allocation inside truck and weight.  They take junk and donatable stuff as well; things get sorted at the center and they decide which to donate and which to get rid of.  Awesome service, no fuss and extremely quick!!< /Text>

I found the ad for Junk King and called them. I’m all screwed up with dates while I’m not working so I was surprised when, sure enough, the fellas pulled up just when they said they would. Unfortunately it was I, who thought today was the holiday.  Anyway, they were more than gratious while it took me a few minutes to get up to speed.  They were informative, they were helpful, they were professional and just a nice couple of guys.  In the midst of this virus, that’s hard to find these days.  THANK YOU JUNK KING.< /Text>

Great experience. Had a fairly nice leather mission recliner that the seating collapsed. Was going to cost me too much to get fixed. Was concerned about it going to a landfill. Was so glad to find Junk King and that they recycle 60% of items they take which is very important to me. Robert also took the hardware that fell out of the recliner in case someone picked up the recliner from their warehouse. The cost for pick up was also much less than competitors. Will definately use Junk King again if the need arises. Also the person that took my texts to set up the appointment was so sweet because it was something that was hard for me to part with and was so understanding.<//review>

Sour beginnings with Junk King San Diego, happy ending.
Firstly,my initial contact by text, i was left hanging, waiting for a reply, i had to reinitiate communication just to get a price for them to pick up an old nonworking gas dryer.
After several texts...the estimate was $95 ! I refused.
They later came back with a more reasonable price $40, so i agreed.
The pick up team part of this deal was exceptional, they came early,were very courteous and professional..done deal.< /Review>

Called for same day service and first thing was the representative was very helpful and accommodating. Answered phone right away . Setting up the pick up was very easy and quick. The drivers called before coming to verify appointment time and even said they could come sooner if ok which worked out perfect.  The two gentlemen who came were very professional and helpful. Everything went so smoothly and quick. We will be using this company again and the men that came out this time we will ask for again.  I would recommend this company to anyone.< /Review>

If I could give more than 5 stars I would! Fernando and James were beyond exceptional. They communicated with me throughout the whole process and even arrived sooner than I expected. They quoted me at a very reasonable price and hauled out my furniture in no time. They made the process quick and painless--amazing customer service! They were very respectful and more than considerate. Thank you again!!</Review>

< Review>
First of all.....if there were more than five stars, these guys would deserve whatever the highest rating was. I googled junk removal and found “Junk King”. Their website was straight forward and very informative and I was able to book a free estimate for the very next day. I had no idea what to expect in regards to junk removal. Who would be doing it......what would they be like to deal with..... how efficient would they be......and so on. Upon their arrival, almost immediately I put to rest any and all skepticism. Two nicer young men I have never encountered in a professional situation. They were polite, professional, informative and helpful with any and all questions that I had. Lee and Justin far exceeded my expectations and without hesitation I would call on them again in the future.< /Review>

I used junk king’s services again today as I am moving and I had to call these guys again after such a pleasant first experience. I was not disappointed as the same as the first time I received same day service and impeccable customer consideration. Lee and Franco went above and beyond. I promise you wont regret hiring these guys for your junk removal needs. Thank you for your help!</Review>

My company hires these guys when needed.
Fast and easy. Had them pick up 20 year old 150lb TV and took boxes from the giant new TV s. Very professional and polite when dealing with my clients homes.  Called 10am and they were there by noon. Fair pricing compared to others. Will hire again.< /review>

Great experience!. That came in with the price. They gave us a great quote. I didn’t have that much but they were quick and even asked if I needed anything else in the truck. I asked if it was up to our satisfaction. Great customer service. Will do more business in the future.< /text>

The only somewhat negative comment I have to mention is the pickup was late, but I appreciated being update as to the revised arrival and the reason for the delay.

Justin and Angelo were so amazing and very professional.  Fast and courteous.   I would highly recommend them for this type of service again.

I also want to thank their service center and customer relations.  I needed a quick appointment and then needed to have the  time pushed back a few hours.  They were immediate in responding and very accommodating.   I couldnt have made it without their whole tream.

Thank you again!!!<//review>

I called Junk King last minute while I was moving and had stuff I needed to get rid of as soon as possible. They were able to fit me in and work with my schedule. They were very accommodating to what I needed. I couldn't be there when they came to pick up my junk, but regardless of that they were clear in communication the whole time which put me at ease. They even took before and after photos. The price was reasonable and they worked with my budget.  Very professional and friendly. Highly recommend!</Text>

Junk king saved the day. For a small fee they took away my miscellaneous trash when i was in a bit of a bind. The online appointments work. I was able to set up an appointment the same day within a 2 hour time block. Mickey and ed got my stuff and called me 15 before to give the heads up that they were on the way. I'm not sure when I'll need these services again as I do have residential trash pick up but if I ever needed to get bulky trash out quick i would definitely use them again.<//text>

<Time>1591396679442</Time><rating>1</rating><text>BEWARE!! They pulled a bait & switch on us. We called them this morning and spoke to a man named Kevin. He said they would charge us $495-$695 max to haul 600 sq ft of grass (which we had stacked into 2 piles). We agreed to the price and he said he would have his team arrive at our house at 1pm. They kept getting delayed and at 3pm Dallas & Angelo called to tell us the job would cost around $2,000. When we told him our original quote, he said he would call his boss to discuss. We received a call a few mins later and he told us they would charge us $3,000!!! Unprofessional, shady and unreliable!!<//text>< pictures>

Junk King was absolutely amazing to work with! We had a small backyard full of moving boxes and paper that I needed to clear out. I made the appointment online, which was very easy and they showed up on time the next day, ready to pick up the boxes. Unfortunately, I forget the names of the two guys who were here but they were courteous, reliable and fast. I’m very happy with my experience and would definitely recommend this company!</Review>

Junk king made our junk filled basement manageable again!  Great timing, fast, and very friendly.  They made clearing our broken, heavy shelving, old rugs, and junk look easy.  Will use them again in the future for sure!< /review>

When I called to set up the appointment I was greeted by a knowledgeable and friendly operator (sorry I do not remember your name). On the day of pick up Fernando gave me a call to let me know when he could show up, and even arrived early. Fernando and Josh came in and cleared everything out, and cleaned up after. Great customer service! I highly recommend, I will be a returning customer. Thanks so much!</text>

As much as I wanted to give Junk King a higher rating, my experience was far from seamless in what was already a stressful situation. Before booking for junk removal, I think everyone should at least know what to expect, so that they can avoid running through the same issues as I did.

After getting the news of my grandfather being transferred to hospice, and having to move my grandmother to live with us on short notice, we had to work as quickly as possible to clean out their house. Since it was my first time using a junk removal service, I called around to get a quote that would fit our budget. After meeting with several companies, it was down to Fred’s Junk Removal or Junk King.

Fred’s Junk Removal had a flat rate, but because I met the Junk King representatives in person and they seemed very nice and willing to work with our budget, I decided to book an appointment with them (plus, it doesn’t hurt when they have a guarantee to beat any written estimate). I tried calling the rep that had given me the quote, but it went to voicemail and indicated that I should call the San Diego call center for appointments.

After explaining the situation with my quote reference (2 pickup trucks, including some furniture removal) and telling the agent about Fred’s comparable 3 pickup truck flat rate of $297, I was put on hold so that the call center rep can make some calls for approval. When she got back to me with a price match of $295, I was relieved. I made sure to verify all the info and she confirmed that was the price for the job.

On the day of my appointment, I got Oscar (who I had met previously when I got my quote) and Fernando. According to Fernando, the confirmed quote I got from the call center didn’t match the one they had down, but rather the old estimate. After talking to his boss, he re-quoted me with $570, saying I already had a steal for that price and was free to go with Fred’s Junk Removal if I wanted to because they are busy and I was wasting their time. I felt like I was put in a bind to quickly make a decision, because not only did we had to clear the house by that day and catch a flight home right after, we now missed the opportunity to book with a cheaper option since it was so last minute. Had I known there were so much miscommunication within the company, where confirmation for details and prices of the job aren’t matching up and was even told that the call center “don’t know anything”, I would have went with a different company.

So before you book your appointment, make sure you aren’t on a time scrunch and confirm what the entire job entails, because you might have to pay more than you have to. The one star is for the speediness because they were able to knock it out in a short amount of time.<//Text>

They communicated well through the process to make sure we could find a time that fit my schedule. Fernando called me and provided an estimate and then let me know when they were on the way to the site. They (Fernando and Chris) were on-site early and were very efficient and made sure everything was done correctly. I would certainly use them again and recommend them!<//review>

Service was provided at a storage facility in La Mesa, CA.  In the 2 hour service widow, they arrived just after the first half hour. The young men were prompt and friendly.  All work and transactions were completed in about 20 minutes. Thanks for the great service.  I will recommend Junk King to anyone that needs you service.</Review>

As much as I wanted to give Junk King a higher rating, my experience was far from seamless in what was already a stressful situation. Before booking for junk removal, I think everyone should at least know what to expect, so that they can avoid running through the same issues as I did.

After getting the news of my grandfather being transferred to hospice, and having to move my grandmother to live with us on short notice, we had to work as quickly as possible to clean out their house. Since it was my first time using a junk removal service, I called around to get a quote that would fit our budget. After meeting with several companies, it was down to Fred’s Junk Removal or Junk King.

Fred’s Junk Removal had a flat rate, but because I met the Junk King representatives in person and they seemed very nice and willing to work with our budget, I decided to book an appointment with them (plus, it doesn’t hurt when they have a guarantee to beat any written estimate). I tried calling the rep that had given me the quote, but it went to voicemail and indicated that I should call the San Diego call center for appointments.

After explaining the situation with my quote reference (2 pickup trucks, including some furniture removal) and telling the agent about Fred’s comparable 3 pickup truck flat rate of $297, I was put on hold so that the call center rep can make some calls for approval. When she got back to me with a price match of $295, I was relieved. I made sure to verify all the info and she confirmed that was the price for the job.

On the day of my appointment, I got Oscar (who I had met previously when I got my quote) and Fernando. According to Fernando, the confirmed quote I got from the call center didn’t match the one they had down, but rather the old estimate. After talking to his boss, he re-quoted me with $570, saying I already had a steal for that price and was free to go with Fred’s Junk Removal if I wanted to because they are busy and I was wasting their time. I felt like I was put in a bind to quickly make a decision, because not only did we had to clear the house by that day and catch a flight home right after, we now missed the opportunity to book with a cheaper option since it was so last minute. Had I known there were so much miscommunication within the company, where confirmation for details and prices of the job aren’t matching up and was even told that the call center “don’t know anything”, I would have went with a different company.

So before you book your appointment, make sure you aren’t on a time scrunch and confirm what the entire job entails, because you might have to pay more than you have to. The one star is for the speediness because they were able to knock it out in a short amount of time.< /Text>

<Review>The guys at Junk King were amazing. They came early, looked at my stuff and priced-matched my other quote. They did an excellent job at moving my stuff out and were very nice. I recommend Junk King for any hauling needs one may have. I’ll definitely be calling them when I need to haul more stuff away. Thank you Junk King for your professionalism 😊</Review>< Time>

This Guys are amazing, and Dylan and Oscar are great asset to this Company they are very reliable and hardworking people that deserves appreciation on the job they Do.

<review>These guys are great. Quick response time to quote requests, on time for pick up. They worked with my budget and were done within an hour. Also, side note for ladies: They didn't give me the creepy vibe, and being a single female that's a bonus in my book.<//review>< pictures>

I only had a mattress for them to remove. I had asked for as early as possible and they could only schedule me for 9-11 but then they called at 8:15! Yes!!!! They came in, super friendly, and asked if they could take anything off my hands since it was almost over too quickly! Thank you so much for helping me out!!! Would definitely use again.</review>

<review>Richard and Josh were the best. Friendly, courteous, young men. They called to inform me that they were unloading another job and will be on there way. In no time they were here explaining how they price and they were ready to start right away. They were so worried about damaging other household items. I was so happy they were there I didn't mind if anything fell, but it didn't. They were also fast. I enjoyed my brief time with them and I'm texting my friends to tell them about this great service.</review><Rating>5</Rating><gmapID>0x80dbf9c609949b2b:0x389fd732f2d7901c< /gmapID><user_name>Johari Lewis< /user_name><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Called 5 different places around town, Junk King provided the fastest response (showed up 2hrs after i called) and was by far the most inexpensive (almost 200$ Dif in some cases even more). Austin and Franko assisted us and had the entire job done in about 45 minutes. 26 bags of dirt and wood chips each weighing about 100+lbs, Some closet doors, and random trash. Would definitely call again if i need anything else removed.<//review>

<Text>Setup appointment early morning via website for same day service 2-4pm window. Rec’d call that a truck has availability to stop by to pickup a few bulky items within 30 mins circa 12 noon. Andy/Dylan were great and even offered to take several bulky boxes that I had planned to gradually break down and put in my home bin.

The cost is not outlandishly expensive and is a tremendous convenience value, and what we as a society need to continue to accept as necessary to ensure all that is recycled is done so properly vs. dumping all into a landfill, etc.

I had the pleasure of working with Dylan and Justin. They were quick, super friendly and made this experience really easy. Also, I used the company's cost estimator on the website and it was really close to price, so that made it even easier to budget for sure no surprises. Highly recommend Junk King.<//Text>

I am so glad that this company is here. I have been using Junk King services for a while now and I have never been disappointed. My appointment for today was between 10 and 12 however I received a phone call asking if I would be interested in them coming early. Esteban and Chris did an amazing job!!! They arrived when they said they would and got straight to work. I knew exactly how much I would be paying from the start and everything I asked to be removed was gone and they worked very fast! My day is now free. Junk King services are very professional and reliable. Trust me when I say that they value their customers time and business. I am definitely a long term customer!!</Review>

Robert and Oscar were very pleasant and conducted themselves very professionally. They gave me an estimate in writing and worked quickly and efficiently to gather my “junk” (many boxes of books and other items). I could not be happier with the outcome!<//text>

I was very impressed with the level of service I received and the efficiency of the process.  I received a call from CJ yesterday afternoon explaining the process to me, including how the rates would be calculated for the load And to set up a time for service. This morning I got a call letting me know they were on their way. I got another call confirming the load size and the price. And then I got final call confirming that the service was complete. They took my credit card right over the phone. Rates were great. All three of the individuals that I spoke with:  Mike, CJ and Dylan were kind, respectful and very supportive in answering my questions. Highly recommend this company.<//Text>

<text>We called Junk King on Sunday afternoon and they answered and scheduled a time for Monday morning.  They showed up at 10am, right on time, and worked with me to find a price within my budget.  Andy and Austin were very friendly and accommodating and had everything in the truck within 10 minutes, including sweeping up my garage.  I would highly recommend them.</text></record>

They set to work immediately, making sure to ask before altering anything in the house, and got everything cleared very quickly.

<Text>Richard and James from the very moment they drove up were kind, courteous, and provided the most professional service possible. Not only were they able to trek waste items from our backyard to the front, they did so in a timely manner, assuring that no other items were damaged or left dirty.

The price to remove our waste was fair, considering that they nearly removed our entire backyard, giving us the opportunity to start anew (thank you!!!).

If I could recommend any junk removers to anyone in search of one, it would definitely be Junk King, and more specifically Richard and James.

You’re the best in the business!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

The two men came by and were very polite. They explained the process and showed the breakdown of prices.  We had scheduled an appointment for a free estimate, but they were able to haul away the junk that same day and within 30 minutes. They swept the area and even took time to pick up the small pieces of trash they found. Super nice, fast, easy to work with. Thanks Junk King!!<//Review>

Richard and Austin were fantastic. Very professional, courteous, and arrived exactly when they said they would. My job was not going to be easy as the home has a steep flight of stairs with a turn in the middle. They took care of it quickly and without any issues. I'll definitely call again if I need anything else removed. Thank you.</review>

Junk Kings came out last minute and was able to get rid of everything within 2 hours on the spot.  I had other quotes from other hailing companies and Junk Kings camr in at half the price.  Wife added a few things, not much but they were able accommodate with no issues.  We had little time left before we moved Austin, TX and Junk Kings made it happen.  Definate a company my wife and would use again.  The guys that showed up we 2 of nicest most professional guys we had talked to since acquiring junk removal bids.< /Text>

Junk king staffs arrived on time at the location. Fees are very much negotiable and competitive, if not far less. They were quick with their work and very professional. I would surely recommend JunkKing to our friends and neighbors.< /Text>

I was in a bind getting yard waste picked up. I called Junk King for a free estimate. Within 15 minutes they were at my home. They quoted me a reasonable rate and quickly loaded and cleaned up. I would love to thank Richard Q. and Fernando for a wonderful job. Highly recommend!!!</Review>

Fernando and Austin were so awesome! I had a dirt pile that I didnt know would cost so much to get rid of, plus some other garbage...I was really disappointed to find out how much it would cost because I really need to get rid of it, but can't afford it. They were so helpful! They took care of the other garbage at a very reasonable price and though I still have a dirt pile I need to get rid of, I have to rave about them and this company!! I will definitely be referring them and using Junk King for future removals.<//text>

<Review>Justin and Josh were super professional and very nice! I called them out for an estimate and was impressed with their politeness. Hired them on the spot and they knocked the job out in less than 10 mins. Money well spent!!

Junk king finished a job at my place for removing furniture and junk and they were amazing. Esteban and Max, the junk king personnel, were friendly, polite, efficient, and thorough. It was a pretty large job taking almost most everything in my place. They started by asking me what needed to go, gave me a quote, and while they were working checked in with me to make sure everything was as expected. It was real simple and easy and I definitely recommend the company.< /review>

Fernando was extremely professional and personable. He called ahead of time and showed up early. He removed everything incredibly fast and cleaned up the area better than I had left it. I’ll use them again.< /text>

< Review>
My work needed a large vending machine and other E-waste items removed. Not only were the movers very professional and enthusiastic, but they were FAST. It probably took them 20 minutes tops to haul away our old items. Fernando and Chris were very kind.

It's also fairly priced considering the volume and weight of our machines.

I would highly recommend their services.</Review>

So happy with this service. Fernando and Oscar were on time, friendly and a pleasure to work with. Additionally, when booking, I needed a short window of time within 24 hours for pickup. Christina accommodated my request without question and Fernando and Oscar delivered. I will 100% be using this service again and highly recommend.</text>

The guys were great! Called me in the morning to confirm that I was in the schedule and then let me know when they were 15min out. Very professional service and would recommend them to anyone that needed the service. Will be using them again!</Review>

<time>1554011204427</time><text>James and Rich were wonderful. They were very sensitive to the fact that it was my very recently deceased father's items were being removed. They came early after a phone call verifying it was ok and promptly got to work . My brother visiting from a small town in Illinois was astonished at how quickly the items were loaded up and gone.  This is the second time I have used them and will continue to do so in the future.<//text></record>

< Review>
I had a sofa and a loveseat that a local charity donation decided not take so I called Junk King because of the high volume of five (5) star ratings/reviews.  I called the same day and they came to my rescue and was at my house within the next hour.  Great customer service along with great guys that came to pick up my items.  I will definitely be calling Junk King for any future item removal!  Thank you Junk King!</Review>

<Review>Robert and Justin were fantastic! They called ahead of time to make sure if it was ok for them to stop by little earlier. They made it to my house before I did and waited patiently for me to arrive. The whole process was fast and easier than I had ever imagined. I would definitely use this service again, the fact that they are an eco friendly recycling  company is an added bonus to their great service.

Called Junk King San Diego last week, and with ease was able to schedule them with ease over the phone. The two gentleman that came out were CJ & Lee and they were some of the most professional and proficient workers I have ever seen. Keep up the good work Junk King San Diego and I would recommend them for anyone!< /Review>

He even offered to clean up a bunch of dirt that I had laying around on my porch just out of the blue; I totally forgot it needed to be done but he was on top of it. I would definitely call CJ any time I needed junk hauled off.< /review>

<review>Junk King picked up my 2 heavy old televisions. I couldn't find a Goodwill store that picked up these old t.v.'s. For a reasonable fee, two guys picked them up and took them off my hands to be recycled.

Thank you Junk King and C.J. for your swift response and professional service!

Satisfied client,

Thanks Dylan and Oscar, y’all are amazing!!<//review>

Called Junk King San Diego last week, and with ease was able to schedule them with ease over the phone. The two gentleman that came out were CJ & Lee and they were some of the most professional and proficient workers I have ever seen. Keep up the good work Junk King San Diego and I would recommend them for anyone!<//Review>

Excellent service! I work in hospitality and know what authentic/genuine customer service looks like.  Not only did Richard and Rene work quickly but they also asked how my day was going. Small but in my book it is huge because it is such a rarity in this line of work.  I was very pleased and what a relief to have them help me make room for a new living space.<//Review>

And I had booked for the next morning since I was on a deadline to haul out furniture. But Junk King surprised me!  Estebar and Rene were there early in the morning and worked fast!

Today I used Junk King for the first time to remove an old couch. Was told they'd give an estimate and if agreed then they can take the item.  James and Estaban were great and very helpful .. not to mention quick and arrived as set appointment will definitely use again.

I'd highly recommend Junk King for hauling unwanted items. I got a quick reply to my request for a quote. I was told they'd need to see what needed to be hauled before they could give me a quote.
CJ and his colleague were prompt, professional and quick! CJ had a sheet with a set price for volume of truck load but was able to work with me a little on the price which I appreciated very much.<//Review>

C.J. and the team were FANTASTIC!!!  They were professional and efficient.  Not only did they quickly haul away all our junk, but they swept the areas where the junk had been.  I would "definitely" use their services again!!!

Just wanted to leave another review... I'm a return customer of Junk King.  They are absolutely TERRIFIC!!!  (Thanks guys.😊)</text>

Booking process was simple, they are very fast to respond. The whole process of picking up my furniture took about 10 mins. Very professional and convenient. Will absolutely use them again.<//text>

<review>What a wonderful company! I wish I had more junk to haul. From just calling to set up the appt to finishing the work amazing. Christina was great and friendly and very helpful in explaining the services and the coat break downs.  Once the appt was set (less than 24 hours later) the Richard and his crew arrived on time and ready to go. The quote was honest and fair and they completed the work quickly and cleanly. I Was so impressed with the work that was completed.  Richard was way fair with his quote and I really appreciated it. I would recommend Junk King to anyone in the market. I was truly impressed. Trust me all the positive reviews are honest and well earned!  Thank you guys!<//review><userid>103861133821681231681< /userid><rate>5< /rate>< date>

<review>Quick and convenient.  Very easy to do business with!  John and Chris called soon after the start of my appointment window and said they were already in my complex.  I gave them directions to my unit, they saw the mattress, and took it away.  Very friendly and professional guys for sure, and the rate was very very reasonable.  Will gladly use this service again next time I need them.< /review><Rating>5<//Rating>< Name>

<text>Making the free estimate appointment was easy.  The crew showed up on time and I didn't even need to be home.  They called me, gave me an estimate, I gave the ok, then they completed the job in a few minutes.  Then I payed over the phone.  They even sent me before/after pictures.  I highly recommend this company.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Cj and Richard came to my residence and cleared out everything in my garage. Not only were they fast and got the job done, but very professional as well. They were very clear on the pricing and gave me a great quote. I highly recommend Junk King! They are reliable and super efficient and a terrific company to work with!!< /review>

I liked that they called ahead & gave me an accurate update of the arrival time. This allowed me to run out & do errands without worrying about missing them. The young me arrived right on time & were super pleasant. They were very careful & they removed 2 couches. All in all a real pleasure to do business with this company.<//Review>

Setting up the appointment was very easy and they even gave my a discount without using the online appointment maker. Same day service. The guys were friendly, professional, and super fast.<//Review>

I worked with Junk King for 3 days on a hoarder property.  I want to let you know how pleased I am.   They were efficient, patient and extremely hard working.  Whatever I asked of them they did with out a hint of hesitation.  There names of the crew I worked with are Lee, James, and Hinog.  We will definitely be using your services again!< /Text>

I called Junk King today at 10:45am to pickup a long list of junks i had accumulated and by 12:35 pm two strong young gentlemen by the names of Austin & Lee showed up to introduce themselves and explain to me how this business conducts their policy on hauling away junks.  At 1:00 pm, all my headaches and eye sores were gone!!! Thank you very much for being so professional and courteous.  I would highly recommend these to gentlemen when making a pickup appointment with Junk King👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼</review>

I had an 11 AM - 1 PM arrival window.  I received a courtesy call at 10:30 AM letting me know they'd be arriving closer to the 1 PM time, which was very much appreciated.  I had a huge mess to clean up, but Anthony and John were very polite and friendly about the task at hand.  It was very hot outside, yet they worked efficiently through the heat to complete the job.  I appreciate the hard work they did, and the great customer service they provided!</Text>

They try to donate, or other ways to help prevent using the landfill.<//Review><rating>5<//rating><user_id>104121357035627971539< /user_id>< Gmap_id>

I called Junk King yesterday and they arrived promptly this morning with a very reasonable quote to remove almost a whole truckload of some very heavy stuff including an unwieldy vintage stove, concrete pillars and an iron bed. They moved very quickly and carefully cleaned up each area. I highly recommend Junk King!!!< /Text>

<review>The removal guys were on time and called in advance to let me know they were coming. Price was fair, given that there was work needed to break down the grill for removal. They cleaned up well.<//review><UserId.>103044847418182767889< /UserId.>< Pictures>

<Review>I pretty much was bullied into the deal and forced to take a "discount" for my additional items. It all happened in under ten minutes. Now I sit here in shock of how things when so fast.

Feel free to contact me about my experience.</Review>< Pictures>

You know there's every once in a while you find that service provider, that is exactly as you had hoped, and requested. I was looking for a junk hauler this morning, via a Google search and Junk King San Diego popped up on Google. Within a matter of minutes of me shooting them a text, I received a response, and an email, with a quote for the items and recycling  that I needed removed. I set a specific time for pick up, with a two hour window and by the way the quote was far less than some of the other Hauling companies I searched. About 30 minutes prior to the trucks arrival I received a call from John, who asked about the pick up, just wanted to verify what was being picked up, and said he would be there in 30 minutes.  Literally 30 minutes later the truck arrived which was on the dot at the start of the two hour window which made it very convenient, John and Anthony both got out of the truck, shook my hand, introduced themselves to me. The verified the items to be hauled away, no issues. They loaded everything I needed into the truck and were very pleasant throughout. The whole process from start to finish took  literally less than 15 minutes.
I will absolutely 100% recommend Junk King San Diego and if you're lucky you'll get Anthony and John, very courteous gentleman. I am really  pleased with the service.< /text>

< review>
Fernando and Chris met me at the storage unit that we needed to clean out.  They were prompt and gave me a clear, fair estimate upfront.  I had asked them to keep an eye out for some items that we wanted to keep.  Not only did they find items and set them aside for me ... but they also found another item they thought might be valuable and they made sure to let me know about it instead of just discarding it. They completed the job within a couple of hours and now the unit is completely cleaned out and we are so grateful!  Fernando and Chris were absolute professionals about everything and I would definitely recommend Junk King to others.< /review>

<Review>Wow - such a wonderful experience!

CJ and Austin - very hardworking and friendly!

Our field is now clean and clear - everything loaded and CJ and Austin even raked up the little pieces of debris!  Super job!!

I highly recommend CJ, Austin and Junk King - if you want the job done efficiently, quickly, while still being affordable - give them a call!

You won’t be disappointed!  😊👍👏❤️

<Review>Wow - such a wonderful experience!

CJ and Austin - very hardworking and friendly!

Our field is now clean and clear - everything loaded and CJ and Austin even raked up the little pieces of debris!  Super job!!

I highly recommend CJ, Austin and Junk King - if you want the job done efficiently, quickly, while still being affordable - give them a call!

You won’t be disappointed!  😊👍👏❤️

James and James manhandled a 400lb sub-zero up a flight of stairs, a task that their competitor (1-800-still-got-junk-because-we-oversold-our-ability-to-take-said-junk-even-though-the-customer-provided-detailed-and-accurate-accounting-of-said-task-to-remove-junk) refused to take on.

Junk King has my business from now on.< /Review>

<date>1541009630116</date><rate>5</rate><text>This was my first time using any sorta junk removal service so I was a little skeptical about how the process was. Both CJ and Lee who came out were very profesiional and very proficient, and finished all the work in under 2 hours. They not only went above and beyond with their customer service, they even broke down all the wood based furniture so they would only need to make one trip which in the end saved me money. Junk king San Diego has my highest recommendation for anyone who is looking to work with a very professional and very helpful company, who is also more than fair with there price. Thank you Junk King San Diego and I will be sure to recommend you to all my friends in the future.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1543428470255, 'text': "Thank you for allowing us to earn your business and the 5 star review.

Chris and CJ were amazing ! They came on time they took everything out that we wanted so quickly and most of all they presented the best customer services . They left making sure that we were ok and satisfied with their work and  continued to asked is if we needed any more help. Junk king San Diego is the best.< /review>

<text>USE JUNK KING AND FORGET ABOUT CALLING ANYONE ELSE.  I don't live in SD and I was confronted with the enormous and emotionally painful task of cleaning out my dear parents home over Easter weekend.  My realtor highly recommended Junk King and now I know why firsthand.  From the scheduling (so easy on the phone by a competent and knowledgeable rep) to communicating with the gentlemen in charge of the estate move out, everything was flawless.  I received an email confirmation and CJ and Austin called me about 30 min. before my appointment, showed up ON TIME, were extremely professional, in Junk King shirts, polite, pleasant and walked me through the process.  I have had professional movers move and pack me several times, and i have to say, CJ and Austin surpassed my prior experiences - and this one was tough, emotionally hard, as my parents had lived in this home for decades.  CJ gave me a super fair estimate based on the total rooms and how many trucks would be needed, was transparent with me on their pricing, and once I accepted, they immediately went to work.  These guys DO NOT REST.  They move. FAST.  LIKE SUPER FAST.  They work HARD.  And the entire time, they are communicating with me and asking me questions and making sure they are removing everything we need them to.  Nothing was too challenging or shocking for them.  Every time I was worried about a particular area being way too messy or crazy, CJ assured me that he has seen everything and not to stress.  Even the garage didn't cause him to blink an eye.  CJ and Austin were pleasant and so nice.  They didn't complain once and this was a very difficult task.  I cannot say enough about their open communication and professionalism.  They are truly service oriented AND know how to calmly deal with customers who are not only dealing with a difficult move out, but with grief and sadness as well.  They made all of it a little easier to cope with.   If you use Junk King, and I really hope you do, make sure you ask for CJ and Austin.  They will NOT disappoint you.  Great gentlemen who are hard workers.  Thank you CJ and Austin.<//text><user_id>114419764636017616325< /user_id>< Pictures>

Wow! I called Junk King this morning asking for a quote. We just took out all of our kitchen countertops and cabinets and needed to get everything taken ASAP so our new kitchen could be installed. They sent a truck out same day. Richard, Chris and Max came out within a few hours and came in with a quote that was $200 under their competitors. They were nice and courteous and got the whole job done in 20 minutes. They even swept up our back yard and dining room for us! Can’t say enough good things about this experience with them and definitely will use them again!< /text>

< Review>
Do NOT hire these people unless you are looking for a day of frustration, lame excuses and want to keep your junk. After calling my husband and stating they would be here in a half hour (so the end of the scheduled window), they no-showed. An hour and a half later, my husband had to call them back, then deal with a number of dropped calls. It finally got to the point where he had to cancel - by this point it was far outside of the time in which they were supposed to have come. They did offer a discount if we rescheduled, but why would we trust any new date would be any better? Also, it wasn’t about the money - nothing would make up for the lost time and frustration caused by these fools. Do yourself a favor - hire someone else. These people obviously can’t hold up their end of the deal, as we can prove given the fact we still have the couch we were trying to get rid of.< /Review>

I would like to give major kuddos to Junk King for their prompt service with such short notice! Especially to Eddie and Brian! They communicated with me on their status well before their scheduled arrival time and then contacted me on their way with an ETA. They arrived on time and they were both extremely professional, personable and thorough! They listened to exactly what I wanted done,  reviewed it with me, gave me a quick quote and then started work right away.  Even though they were busy loading all my heavy furniture etc they still were very friendly and talked with me throughout the process. I felt very comfortable with them and they did an outstanding job! Did exactly what I asked SUPER fast even in this 80 degree weather.  I would highly recommend them and I will be using them in the future.  Eddie and Brian definitely set the bar high! Thank you Junk King, Eddie and Brian!<//text>
