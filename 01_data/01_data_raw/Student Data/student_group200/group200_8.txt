Adrian was extremely rude towards assisting my mother. He was strangely bothered by her intuitive questions that she made him about an esn change that was processing to be done by him. I will not recommend this sales associate to anyone. Adrian is rude and sarcastic towards helping people. As an ex sales associate myself, I would not retaliate from my customers. I know I would find solutions and make them remember a great experience at all times. I believe that customers have the right of way to everything. It is the customers that help uplift stores. For that reason, I am disappointed to say that my experience there with Adrian was unsatisfying. This should not be tolerated. His behavior was extremely unprofessional.< /Text>

Only A Real Customer Writes A Real, Honest Review!

I had received Excellent, Courteous, Patient Customer Service by Martin who was my sales representative who helped me with exchanging my phone and getting my new one up and running.

Martin, You were Excellent and I can Not Thank You Enough.

I also want to Thank Brenda for assisting me as well and answering all of my questions!

You Are Simply The Best!

Sincerely yours,

The Metro PCS plan looked good and I liked the Samsung Exhibit phone (Great price, only $31, and FREE after mail in rebate) however I ran into a big problem for me, I was told Metro PCS does not support 312 area code phone numbers. I moved here from Chicago and the phone I have now, which I have used for 5 years, is a 312 area code phone. If this changes and you will sell me service for a phone with an area code of 312 _please_ let me know!!! Thanks.< /text>

<Review>Your touch screen sign-in system leaves MUCH to be desired. Faulty and fails to record names, so your customer's are made to wait longer then necessary, and you get huge backlogs because of it. Having a touch screen while Also having a mouse clicker is counterproductive when Niether seems to register a name without resorting to banging the screen.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>I purchased a new phone at one of the other locations but a bad company is a bad company.   My so-called new phone turned out upon further inspection after I left was in fact a used phone.  Thanks Marvin!

I found files, some that the previous owner had tried to delete but didn't in the history.

Be warned...check your phone before you leave to make sure there aren't any previous owner files/folders.  MetroPcs won't tell you the truth.< /Text>< pics>

The customer service was horrible. I bought a new phone and within less than a week it was glitching so I believed I could exchange it since they sold me a glitching phone but they made it difficult. They said I could not have more than an hour of call time and that it had to be within a week that I return the phone. Now the store I bought it from does not have the phone in stock so I have to go 9 miles out too corporate store to solve the problem. The person I talked to for customer service was incompetent and kept on repeating themselves.< /review>

< review>
this is the WORST company! yes it has good deals, yes it's prepaid, the phones are ok. but the service is super horrible! It's time for my husband, and I to pay our monthly bills, so i go online to create an account, it says they're experience difficulties, to call "this number" for immediate assistance, I call...that's down too !!! seriously? .. so I locate my local store location, it says on the site it's open until 5pm, it's 3pm now, I pull up outfront the OPEN sign is on..I try to go in, it's locked and dark inside! FALSE ADVERTISMENT! .. so on their window it says there's a new store now open til 8pm, I drive down there...IT'S CLOSED!!! like come people, it's bad enough the site, and phone service is down for 2 or more days . but to put you're open til this time and you're not ESPECIALLY with an OPEN sign blinking in your window is like disgrace. Having 2 small children we NEED our phones! to top it off..you can't even contact customer service through an email, you have to either call..which it's down or hand write a letter! we're in 2014..let's get with it. horrible horrible HORRIBLE. i'm sooo switching carriers! ughhhhh. I wish I could give no stars.<//review>

(Translated by Google) Very bad service. They don't fix your problem and worse. you can not. Return what came out bad and you can only change the product and pray to God that it is not someone else's that I return it for a defect or worse, give another recycled😪

Legendary street park! All you kooks complaining about it being slick need some park wheels that are softer and grippy. Innovative design with amazingly talented local skaters!<//Review>

It’s a slippery park, yet also the most family friendly I’ve been to in California. It’s located next to a recreational center and has regulated hours. A good place for new skaters to learn board control and get motivated.</Review>

They have awesome skaters there and the weather makes it extra fun. The park is good for street stuff but it can be a bit dirty and it doesn't open till later on the morning which is a bummer for me because I'd like to go before work.<//review>

A really great place to play cards and a super great bar and restaurant. I recommend stopping in to anyone for a bite to eat or for your favorite drink. Or to play you hand at a variety if card game.<//text>

< review>
Recommend by Oscars tires. I was really unsure of what to expect. I have never paid for an alignment before. When I arrived I was met kindly by Katie. She was super kind and helpful. Also met the owner. He definitely sealed the deal with great customer service. I was in an out of the place in 15min. They were not pushy and made the whole transaction easy. Lots of parking at this location. The do accept credit cards.</review>

< Review>
Im just given them a 5 star review bc the owner&his daughter are always so nice. he never bs your estimates, plus he gives free estimates on your front end then gives u an amt. but he's reasonable but his work is never faulty.< /Review>

<Text>Be careful that you get an estimate for the complete job to be performed, I was quoted one estimated price by the actual owner of this facility on paper due to the office help being off that day. When the part came in I dropped off my car and received another estimate receipt With a different price by the office girl which happens to be his daughter “OK” ...Well the job was completed several days later, and WOW  did the final price change from the original two estimates, and not just a small increase $600 above the original rough estimate of $800 (remember 2 quotes).job was done well,  but  Imagine my surprise and inability to pay at the moment of intended pick up. shop stored my vehicle until paid for, how nice.<//Text>< Pics>

I recommend you BUY YOUR OWN PARTS, they will charge you 2 to 3 times as much for parts you can find online for way cheaper!!! They don’t even show you what’s wrong with your car, just have to take there word...a good shop will show you and even give you your old parts back, like they should cause there yours and you own them....always ask for your old parts back...!!</review>

She told me she stressed that it needed to be so spicy it hurt me, which is how I usually phrase it. This is really good food, but it's about as spicy as mild taco seasoning. Not nearly spicy enough.<//Text>< Date>

<Review>We ordered take away. Saag paneer, chicken briyani, naan, and kulcha (bill $46). The taste was OK - the saag had no spicy flavor, the briyani came without raitha or egg, no chutney was included, and we had to ask for plastic spoons and napkins.

The kulcha was well made, as was the Naan.

In a pinch you can go here, but we will likely not be visiting again.</Review><GmapID>0x808de8aa1bd0b8bd:0x5a24b0636a37cd95<//GmapID><date>1599374984993<//date>< user_name>

After a long time for Mother's Day tried Aabha food. In the past the food was great but quantity has always been small. Prices have also jumped quite a bit. The quality of the food on our latest trip this past weekend was terrible, no taste, less quantity, Price can only be justified based on taste and quantity and it had neither but the high price attach to mini to medium size dishes. There is no excuse on any restraunt that does not serve great food whether it is less or more money, quality is the key. Lost of business</Review>

Really loved the food. It was well cooked with perfect spices. Chicken curry and malai kofta were great. Highly recommend for authentic Indian food lovers! We will definitely come back to this place when in carmel!< /review>

Delicious food, big portions, and super friendly owner! We ordered two paneer tika masalas on the phone, but when we picked up the order realized we got two paneer tikas instead. Even though the mistake could have been ours, the owner apologized, and was so kind and generous. He immediately made us the right order (at no charge) and brought free rice, bottles of water, and dessert. Both the paneer tika and the tika masala was amazing. And the Gulab dessert was still warm and fresh, melts in your mouth! Highly recommend this place. The best Indian we have had in the Monterey area. We will definitely be back!< /text>

Unique and excellent Indian cuisine. We randomly discovered this restaurant when the Lafayette bakery was closed and it was a pleasant surprise. We didn't get a chance to try the lunch menu as we stopped by for a quick bite. All the appetizers were really good - The samosas and avocado pomegranate chaat were the highlight. The ambience is great as well.<//Review>

A fine dining restaurant with one of the best Indian cuisines serving Vegetarian and Non Vegetarian dishes. They offer both Buffet and Ala carte. We went there as a party of 15+ Pax. The food was good and staff were very helpful and accommodating. A couple of Indian breads (Cilantro naan to be precise) that had to be replaced as they were over cooked. They serve beer, not sure if they have other spirits. Overall, the experience was excellent. A must visit place if you are craving for Indian food</Text>

Chicken biryani at this place is really bad would not recommend any one to try it unless you want to waste $15. I would rather recommend having chicken biryani from namaste India bistro.< /review>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response><Review>I order from here fairly regularly since I live close, but the last 3/4 orders I’ve made through door dash they have forgotten an item and still charged me for it. This last time, they gave me my food and went back into the kitchen. I checked my order since I’ve had items missing previously, and one was missing. When I finally spoke to someone they said they were out of the item. I felt like it would have been nice for him to tell me when he gave me the food. I had to go through door dash for the reimbursement. Food is good otherwise, but just unfortunate that they just miss the items. If you order out here, make sure you check that everything is there.</Review></record>

Ordered takeout and the guy on the phone was being rude. I ordered the vegetable biryani and the Aloo Gobi and both the items were very bland, even though I ordered them both medium spicy. The food is overpriced. Ambrosia or Namaste are better options in Monterey.<//review>

We've visited Aabha ten or twelve times.  Always excellent  food and service. The staff work very hard to keep up with the Lunch crowds. The buffet price is extremely reasonable especially considering  the quality  of the food.   Dinner is sensational. Highly recommend the lamb chops. They  are the best I've ever had.< /Review>

My wife and I have frequented this restaurant many times, Their lunch buffet use to be the best meal in town for value but they raised the price since we had last dined there. Definitely the reason why we were the only customers present. Food was okay. One chicken dish was over cooked and dry.</Text>

<Text>Ice cold stale food in the buffet with extremely poor service and disgusting bathrooms. Don’t waste you money and time. The place doesn’t even deserve one star. The breads are served when you are done with your plate even when there is no one else in the restaurant. Plains white rice is 3 days old. Pathetic experience.<//Text>< rate>

<text>Great Indian place!  Prices were higher than expected, but consistent with the area.  Service was quick and warm.  Portions were large enough to share with another person and served "family style" to encourage such sharing.  The food itself was very good!  Meat dishes had enough meat to satisfy and vegetarian dishes were plentiful.  Spice level is adjustible at ordering and was prepared according to the level requested.  I will return!< /text><user_id>115640460928248997701<//user_id></record>

Chicken biryani at this place is really bad would not recommend any one to try it unless you want to waste $15. I would rather recommend having chicken biryani from namaste India bistro.< /Review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><text>There seem to be good and bad reviews on Aabha, but our experience there, dinner for two, was wonderful! Compared to other local Indian cuisines they are serving dishes with a lot more flavor than their competitors. Lots of parking outside and lovely atmosphere inside. Staff was friendly and helpful. We had so much food with two entrées that we had leftovers. Great for large and small groups. Will definitely be returning;) ☆☆☆☆☆<//text>< Rate>

<rate>1< /rate><text>Horrible service. I went there for their buffet with my family. Food was good but service was terrible. They didn't bring water until several minutes after we started eating, didn't refill the water, had a difficult time refilling the food on time and even for plates, people had to wait. Granted they were busy but considering they charge close to $20 per person for the buffet, the service was not commensurate with that premium charge.  Went there based on the great reviews on Yelp and Google but left with a bad taste in my mouth.</text>< pics>

<userid>109388759855737960977</userid><review>We just visited this place for lunch buffet. I gave a 4/5 only because their appetizers were cold and soggy. The food was otherwise pretty flavorful and good. I loved their jackfruit masala, yellow dhal & sag paneer. The gulab jamun (dessert) was probably the best I’ve had in a really long time. The waiters were polite & friendly too. Not to forget, the place is dog friendly, with a nice patio on the outside for our four legged pals.</review>< Response>

Oh ..my. Lunch buffet was absolutely delicious.   Great atmosphere and friendly staff. My second mom and I were celebrating our birthdays and it was so thoughtful they sent us a wonderful tasting dessert called mango panacotta.  It was so delicious. I will be back again very soon.<//text>

We have always gone for lunch and it’s always buffet. And the food is stale. I can’t tell how many days but atleast 2 days plus.
Terrible - my whole family had stomach upset.</text>

I've been to Aabha twice. And it's really authentic Indian food, exactly how it should be. Lovve their lunch buffets, especially weekend buffet which also offers free champagne/wine on the house. Their Tandoori and chicken dishes are beyond amazing. Veg options are quite interesting too. Staff is great. Service is smooth and place has really good vibe.<//Text>

Went to the place after seeing the high-grade rating on Maps and Aabha fulfilled the expectations.

Easy to note from the parking lot but found difficulty in locating the entrance.

Ample seating capacity, no congestion. Staff was also supportive.

The restaurant offers a buffet food. The meal was excellent and delicious. Enough varieties of items to try. Moderately spicy.
Naan was soft and surpassing.
However, there was a significant delay in getting the Naan.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>My friend and I have heard about this Indian Restaurant but never tried it until last Friday when we were in the area looking for a descent place to eat at. And I remembered that there is a new Indian restaurant that I had googled earlier but couldn't remember its name. At first, we both were hesitant to commit to get in--knowing what we know about typical Indian dishes where the food itself comes secondary to the overwhelming amount of spices in it. Long story short, we got in and after browsing through the menu, I ordered Lamb Shank and my friend ordered Lamb Chops. After about half an hour wait, the waiter brought our orders, and boy, was it delicious!!! I must mention, both my friend and I are extremely picky about foods and we cook foods from a wide variety of cuisines--Middle eastern to Mediterranean to Italian and French, and everything in between on a regular basis, yet we couldn't find one thing to complain about. We tasted each other's foods and both agreed that the Lamb shank and the Lamb chops were one of the best we've had. The complex layers of flavor were revealed with every single bite. Later on, the chef/owner himself came and greeted us warmly and told us that he makes even the spices from scratch every day. Of course, such flavor and aroma cannot come out of any kind of over-the shelf spices. The overall ambient of the restaurant is very cozy and welcoming. The service staff are very friendly, responsive and knowledgeable about the menu. The service is not shy of that of any five star restaurant. By far, that was the best experience we had with any restaurant on the Peninsula. Great job Chef/Owner Bhupender, keep up the creativity and the great work!!! I unhesitatingly give this restaurant my highest recommendations.

I am and found it just satisfactory- the flavor was mild. This is perhaps attractive to Americans. Avoid the tea- it's really bad if you're expecting masala chai. We were the only 3 Indians in the room. It's clear the place caters to non-Indians.<//Review>< rate>

Although the food was good, I was a little underwhelmed. I got the Tandoori Tri-meat platter. Most of the meat was dry, and there wasn't much there for the price. The waiter was also quite aggressively trying to get me to order the garlic naan over plain, and not in a good-natured sort of way.</Review>

Amazing food, very balanced flavors and more spiced than most Indian Restaurants I've been to. The manager, perhaps the owner and chef?, was walking around on a busy Saturday and constantly checking on our table of 2, making sure we were getting fast service even though every table was full at the time. Told us many times he was happy we were there and grateful we enjoyed the food. I appreciated the separate vegan menu and I cannot RAVE enough about the Mango Panna Cotta. Would recommend samosas, scallops, and the tofu tikka. SO GOOD.< /text>

The reviews are great but I find the place ordinary. There are much better food options around this area. We got the tandoori platter which was okay and the Malai kofta was disappointing. The bread basket was nothing great either with the stuffing in the onion kulcha coming out bland and uncooked. Wouldn't recommend the gobhi Manchurian either.

Their service is pretty good and also have a nice place to dine outside.< /text>< GmapID>

<Text>Worst wait time ever for a very simple order of daal and rice. We went there with my 3 years old on a Friday night at 8:00 PM. We kept waiting for more than 45 minutes and nothing showed up. Finally, we saw the head chef BD walking around so talked him. He was super rude and said that the wait time should be expected irrespective how simple the order is. The frustrating thing is that no one told us about this as I saw my 3 year old asking for food again and again helplessly. They didn't have high chair for my son. The daal that finally arrived was spicy despite giving clear instructions to not be spicy for my son. The roti was hard. We didn't order naan and the chef kept shoving naan despite telling him twice that we didn't order it.

I think the dining space is also very depressing. Overall, I am super disappointed in wait time, hospitality and food... The worst ever!!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808de8aa1bd0b8bd:0x5a24b0636a37cd95</Gmap_id></record>

It is the favorite restaurant of my entire family.  Personally, when I go out to eat, even in the Monterey area, I am often disappointed but not, here.  The food is always consistent, delicious, intriguing.  We haven't tried everything as we are creatures of habit but some of our favorite dishes so far include:  Dal Abha, Lamb/Goat Cheese Appetizer, the Chaat, the cheese Naan and our newest favorite is the Lamb Mint Korma.  If you like Indian food, you won't be disappointed!  Go try it--I know it can be hard for restaurants to succeed in this area and I really want them to gain the following they deserve!< /Text>< Date>

The food tastes really good but initially we ordered chicken biryani but the rice was undercooked and we told the waiter and he brought it back after a while saying they cooked it again. It was still raw and we informed the waiter and this time around the manager came and said would you like to order something else and i did. They even gave us some curry on the house while waiting but at the end when we got the check they charged us for the chicken biryani. It was common courtesy to inform a client that they will charge for the second order even though the first order was raw. Because usually when the restaurant makes a mistake they dont charge. Did not like the client service and being ripped of manipulatively.</text>

<review>Food is super good. I can easily say that its the best Indian food I have had in California.
Chef. Bhupinder is really good with his flavors and loved the special Shaahi Tukdaa, a dessert from Hyderabad, which he offered us as his speciality !!
Loved the ambience, patio is very nice and lunch there would be really nice, when we go again there tomorrow :)<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

We drove 2 hours just to come to this place.  And all I can say is: it was worth the drive!

We made a reservation since there was 6 of us.  When we arrived, our table was ready.  From the beginning, everyone was great and this place truly worked together to help serve us.

Our waiter Sagar was truly one of the best waiters I have encountered.  He was personable, funny, and very helpful if we had any questions.  He was on top of everything.  The Aabha restaurant is truly lucky to have him.  I also noticed him serving at another table and he was giving them the same great service he was giving us.  Truly a gem!  And it made our experience there even more enjoyable.

Now for the wonderful food!  They started us out with Papadum and 3 different sauces to dip in.  Very light but full of flavor.  For appetizers, we ordered Lamb and Goat Cheese Kebab and Turmeric-Garlic Scallops.  Both were wonderful flavor combinations and everyone enjoyed them.

For the entrees:
I ordered the Rogan Josh which is a traditional lamb curry dish.  I ordered it spicy which kicked in after about 3 bites.  Lamb was tender and I enjoyed it with the rice it comes with.
BF asked the waiter to bring out one of the best dishes they had and he brought out the Fornetire Lamb Chops which was not on the menu.
The other entrees ordered were Coconut Prawn Curry, Lamb Biryani, Prawn Pineapple Tikka, and Lamb Seekh Kebab (which is like the lamb kebab appetizer without the goat cheese).  Everyone seemed to enjoy their meal.  We also ordered Garlic-Rosemary Naan to go with the meal which was just the right amount of fluffiness and oozing with garlic and just the right amount of hint of rosemary.

At the end, the chef even came out to see how everything was.

I can say if you are in the area, this should be a must stop.  We will be going back whenever we make the drive up to Carmel again.<//Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) We had been with eight people for dinner at the Aabha. In contrast to our first visit, for two, the order entry did not work this time. The appetizer was forgotten and brought with the main course and the side dishes rice was served in one person only after two requests.
The quality of the food is therefore top, it has without exception all tasted.

(Original)
Wir waren mit acht Personen zum Abendessen im Aabha gewesen. Im Gegensatz zu unserem ersten Besuch , zu Zweit, klappte leider die Bestellaufnahme dieses mal überhaupt nicht. Die Vorspeise wurde vergessen und erst mit dem Hauptgang gebracht und der Beilagen Reis wurde bei einer Person erst nach zweimaliger Nachfrage serviert.
Die Qualität des Essens ist dementgegen top, es hat ausnahmslos allen geschmeckt.< /Review>< pictures>

She said a fill for ombre would be $30.  The pedicure was also  very detailed. They use a liner over their bowl and the chairs are the massage chairs.  They have different pedicure packages if you are looking to treat yourself to a more expensive pedicure.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8TFPXbfKymM1Er2vD7Y8bMnqeMh4PPt2Iy5Vs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNybh_9nRIwoS1EmezPvYlvwL7iwPTQKil6bhz1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><resp>{'time': 1622657174731, 'text': 'Dear Suzanne,\n\nThank you so much for your kind words and recommendation!

<Review>I'm not from this area but was here by chance and decided to go. Loved it. Very clean and friendly. I got a pedicure done and it was relaxing and thorough. Also she was patient with me when I was picking a color because I'm so indecisive, so that's important to me. Great experience overall. Would go again if ever in the area.< /Review><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

<text>The best!!!!! No words describe the time and care these people take on you. My nails and toes look beautiful every time. I have to have acrylic toenails put on my big toes and they make It look soooo natural and real so I'm not self conscious. Van, Tina are amazing. Tina's pedicures and massages are the best. Thank you for always taking care and time for myself AND my daughter. I will NEVER EVER go anywhere else. Best nail salon in the IE.< /text>< pics>

This is the worst nail salon ever.
The guy cut my finger while doing my nails
The nail polish is bumpy
My nails look bumpy.
The man who was doing my pedicure he cut my nails unevenly

Such a good experience. Went in today for a fill on my set that wasn't done very well at a different salon. They took me immediately and the man did a wonderful job and paid great attention to detail. I was referred here by a coworker and I'm glad I came. Great service at a great price.< /review>

<text>This is the worst nail salon I have EVER been to. The very first time I came here the girl filed my skin and made me bleed and today I decide to give it a shot, a fresh set, my nails were bare, the shape is bumpy, the polish is bumpy and jagged and I asked for them to be fixed and all he did was put more polish on top so when I complain again they say they can add more polish. I asked for my money back so they cut them off leaving them extremely jagged and gave me my money back. Not to mention the guy cut my actual fingertips while trimming my real nails. All I wanted was a new fresh set and they wasted 3 hours of my time and only made my nails look worse<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

I went in to get my nail fixed, it was my first time here.  The place was small and packed. The owner did my nails.  I've had them on one week and they look horrible.  I've been getting my nails done for years,  and this is the worst they look.   My middle fingers are wider and thicker than the rest. My cuticles are horrible.  Maybe it to busy for her to concentrate on doing a good job.  I will not be returning.</text>

All I gotta say is I didn't like this place at all! They were really rude and don't know how to do nails at all!! My nails are ugly one of my nails snapped in half and only had them for a few days. The nail polish color is coming off and I haven't even had them for a week. Never again I'm I coming here. I don't recommend this place to anyone.< /text>
<Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>
<date>1491093885507<//date><Text>3rd time there I don't know why I even try to give them a chance. The older man who does nails ruined my nails again (2nd time) and cuts my skin with the machine. I Picked a gel color and he went to get the wrong one. It appeared  lighter than the one I've chosen so I told him before he started painting, he claims that it darkens with a second coat. And I was right it wasn't the right color. He said they will charge extra to take off gel and re paint. I Told the owner that it wasn't what I wanted and she still charged me full price and the man arguing in the background saying that's what I picked. So she said next time they will take care of me... that's what happened the last time.< /Text>< gmapID>

The man that did my pedicure was very rough.  I've never experienced a technique such as his. He clipped and pulled the nail and it was very painful.  I'm not sure of his name, but there's only 2 guys there. If I go back again,  I'll ask for a lady to do my pedicure.<//review>

< Review>
Recently I moved here from out of state and decided to stop for a pedicure. My polish didn't hold well after 3 days. I decided to try them again and the same person did it. Once again I was disappointed. Maybe some are too busy to pay attention to detail.</Review>

I've been a patient of Dr. Boozers for five or six years now and I feel very fortunate to have found him as my primary physician. It's more like having a visit with a friend instead of a doctor's appointment. He's a great listener as well as a great Doctor. Couldn't be happier.<//text>

I also had an appointment scheduled with a surgeon before my appointment with Dr. Boozer. My appointment with the surgeon was delayed which delayed my appointment with Dr Boozer. He was scheduled to leave at 2:15. Dr Boozer waited to see me. He could have easily just told me to reschedule because I was not available for my 1:45 appointment with him. I really appreciate that he waited for me and when he saw me did not rush through the office visit. He listened to my issues answered my questions and requested the necessary tests. I would recommend Dr.  Boozer to everyone!<//Review>< pics>

He's been my doctor for about ten years now. And I always feel comfortable meeting with him.  Listens well and will explain anything I'm not sure about.  It's like going to see a knowledgeable friend. Instead of a "don't have time for you, hurry up" doctor.
Thanks Dr Boozer!< /text>

<text>Doctor Boozer has been my doctor as long as he has been on Florida (very long time). He is kind, considerate, a good listener, family man, excellent physician. He carried me through the 1% worst case of West Nile Virus in 2012.  I lived and have no permanent side effects. He saved my life. Anyone associated with Doctor Boozer is blessed by God.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Dr, Boozer is an excellent, knowledgeable, and caring Primary Physican who has been our Primary for over 20 years.  Dr Boozer's nurse, Gabby, is beyond reproach.  However, getting ahold of the office and parking is another story which I will not get into at this time.  Kudos to Katrina and all the receptionists.< /text>

<Text>Having been Dr. Boozer's patient for nearly 30 years, I feel as though I've gotten to know him quite well.  He's an outstanding doctor and a caring and compassionate person.  I know him to be a "doctor's doctor", a physician to whom other doctors trust the care of their families and themselves.

I've watched McHenry Medical group evolve through several incarnations to become First Choice Physicians.  While I dislike the inevitable changes that corporate ownership brings to healthcare, I will say that Dr. B manages to infuse his appointments with a genuine spirit of interest and caring for the individual  (and he does make you feel like a person and not a case file) and a sense of security knowing you're in extremely competent hands.  His nurse, Gabby, is wonderful and many long-time support people (thanks, Kathleen!) make navigating the current health care environment just a bit easier and friendlier.  I guess I still consider them "my people".</Text><user_id>101856214356256550929<//user_id>< Name>

Jim has been my primary physician for 2 decades.  Through his care I avoided a heart attack because he ordered a test even though Blue Cross wanted to deny it and a blockage was found.  Sure I needed a cabbage but my heart seems to be just fine.  Jim does care for the whole person not just the symptom you share.</Text>

I’ve had the sugar twists, crumb, coconut, iced coffee and today their bran muffin.
I’m not a fan of the coconut but my friend is.
Over all I enjoy paying this little shop a visit<//text>

Went specifically for the muffins. Got the blueberry. Only a few blueberries inside and it was dry. Very disappointing for $2.<//Review>

Food seems to be tasty, but too processed. Even simple coffee contains sugar. Only for sweet tooth. M size standard coffee is about 500 ml!< /review>

<Text>Ordered a bacon and egg croissant sandwich. A thin piece  of egg with microwave bacon.
I go to pay he says my card is declined.
So turn to his atm probably owned by him with the same card and get 20 out but a 2.50 charge.
Pretty sneaky.  I won't return. Lame<//Text>< rating>

Unfortunately I didn’t get a chance to try their donuts because of the very rude man that works late at night. I think he is the owner. I hate to bring race into it but he really treated me rudely from the moment I walked in and I know it was because of the color of my skin. I walked in at like 11pm asked for a dozen donuts holes and realize I left my wallet in the car so I say hold on one sec I have to run to the car and get my wallet. So I do and come back in a and noticed he didn’t even get the donuts I order ready but I didn’t pay it any mind. We then proceeded to the register. I have a card with a chip and after he asked me to swipe my card and it didn’t work I said I have a chip and got ready to insert my card. He then says “your card has no money” I said of course it does I crust have a chip so it we just have to try again he grabs the donuts off the counter and then says “your card has no money” again. All this and the total is just $1.75. I am so upset because I live in the area and now have to avoid going to the closet donut shop to my house that’s open 24 hours because the owner is a RACIST JURK! I would never go back and would give him 0 stars if I could!<//Text>

The definition of "meh".

15 minutes to get a grocery-store bagel? Really?

The back area looks really suspect when it comes to cleanliness.< /text>

Best donuts on PCH in Lomita the Cajun seafood is the bomb also, but is only served between 7am to 7pm. Calling ahead is optimal.<//review>

Stopped by on a Sunday morning. There was a line for the ordering window. The staff is wonderful! The young lady at the window was cheerful and super helpful. We ordered vanilla iced coffees. Good coffee. We also got a ham and cheese croissant and the french toast special. The french toast was delicious.</text>

< Review>
This place was AMAZING for a few reasons...

The food was fabulous!  We had a breakfast bowl, a veggie bagel, and a breakfast burrito, which we all loved!

The drinks were tasty.  I got a couple tasty iced chai teas and iced tea/lemonade over the weekend.

Great service!

The owner went above and beyond by hunting down my wallet at left at the restaurant and putting it in overnight mail to return to me in Phoenix!<//Review>

SO good! Sweet service (you can only tip with cash or before they swipe your card- so make sure you do that)! My girlfriends and I got a little bit of everything (coffee, refresher tea, smoothies, bagels, griddle donuts, bacon bomb sandwich, and yogurt bowl) all amazing. Super nice because they have heathy/light options and stuff-my-face-with-all-the-calories options for food and drinks.<//Text>

Coffee A+, got salted caramel which is usually way over done but they mixed it in just right. If you get the tea add some honey and you're set.< /review>< name>

The shots were over extracted (bitter) and the milk was burnt and the texturing was choppy, not micro foamed/silky/creamy at all ! So disappointed. Maybe a new barista or just a bad day.. I didn’t eat but customers were talking about how good the food was. Maybe reviews focus more on the food, not sure. Very friendly staff !< /Text>< pics>

<Review>Decent coffee and decent food. The burrito is a bit bland but that’s typical for California. No one has taught CA about the wonders of green chile, so cold salsa verde is always a little strange on a breakfast burrito, at least it didn’t have sour cream, avocado, spinach or come in a sun dried tomato tortilla... that’s a wrap, not a burrito, California! Staff was friendly,  everyone was wearing masks and being considerate and hygienic. Good vibes in a beautiful location. Good to have a sit on a bench and take in a bit of fresh air.< /Review>< Resp>

<Review>I'm from the south and recently moved to the bay area. Since the move, I eat biscuits and gravy any chance I get, since that is my favorite food.

Today on a weekend getaway to Three Rivers, I had the biscuits and gravy at Sequoia Coffee Company. It was, by far, the best biscuits and gravy I've had since moving to California and maybe longer than that.  Fluffy biscuits with piping hot spicy sausage gravy.  Delicious.  I'm not sure exactly what type of sausage was used, but it tasted like andouille.  It was the perfect blend of tastes making for an unexpected yet mouth-watering breakfast.

Would highly recommend.  Oh, the coffee was good as well.<//Review>< UserId.>

Be sure to hit up this super cute spot in three rivers town right before heading to Sequoia NP.
It has the essential coffee drinks and some small pastries (I.e. muffins and a popular donut) and some breakfast sandwiches.
The avo toast was decent. Perhaps it wasn't prepared the way it usually is, but we felt the flavor was a bit bland.
I got an iced mocha with almond milk and it hit the spot cos it was damn hot on this day.

Lovely spot overall ✌</text>

The employees here are extremely friendly and welcoming they also have an amazing selection of breakfast food. The bagel sandwiches are soft and very easy to enjoy without getting a worn out jaw. The Biscuits and Gravy are flavorful and are just as good as homemade biscuits and gravy. The coffees are full of delicious flavors. And they have a thing I have never seen before called griddle donuts that are very yummy. Definitely worth stopping by for a quick bite or a coffee to go.< /Review>

And of course, coffee is 👌👌👌. I'm amazed there is a gem like this hidden away up in the mountains. Do yourself a favor and stop by for a coffee and a smile.</Text>< pictures>

<review>Great little local coffee shop in Three Rivers. Good selection of coffee drinks - better selection of food. The breakfast burrito was delicious, but the biscuits and gravy (weekends only) is to die for. Limited seating outside - so be prepared for a little wait. But its worth it!< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMO6W0q1lNCYm1-3DuSBJMVCXy8IrFHosSk6ntW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNO7ctziuET2KF216Wb0zFWnOBs6PRxDSmRR8Sc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObNaPRxgP-1sAB7L0lloXv6OwXfLbypmcRskCu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80954f418d6f1223:0xbde5a31a223e9c06<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This is a must stop coffee shop if you are visiting the Sequoia National Park. The staff is friendly and will give you ideas of different things to see in the area. Their coffee was really good, better than Starbucks or Dunkin, and their waffle pressed donuts were delicious. So good in fact that they were worth the 10 hour trip by them selves. Go get some morning coffee and a donut here, and have a safe hike.<//Review>

This is a very cute and quaint little coffee shop - perfect for a quick grab and go breakfast or snack. The bagels were yum, the coffee was strong but the best part was the warm griddle donut. Absolutely delightful :)
Josh was super friendly and nice to talk to, definitely a great pitstop before entering the park!<//Review>

< review>
Come here for the BEST BISCUITS AND GRAVY! I kept passing by and finally made the time to stop in and was blown away by the biscuits and gravy. The half order comes a well-seasoned, meaty, sausage gravy and one fluffy biscuit. (A full order gets you two biscuits.) I recently went to The Runway Cafe in Woodlake for their popular biscuits and gravy, but it was a bland, boring gravy with a gummy textured biscuit. This one at Sequoia Coffee is hands down amazing and a great way to start your day.

My iced coffee was so-so, because I like a strong, concentrated coffee. The waffle donut was good and I could see myself ordering that again--but the biscuits and gravy was worth writing home about. I feel awful for ignoring this place. It deserves way more attention. I'll be back to try the rest of their breakfast sandwiches, pastries, and drinks.<//review>

<Date>1571786965462</Date><rate>3<//rate><Text>Paid an extra 20 cents for the hot tea as they didn't change their menu prices yet. Not hard to modify so each customer doesn't get a surprise. Or just be courteous and give me back the extra change due since it's a mistake on your part. Waiting more than five minutes for it is fine, until I ask where my order is only to get the barista with an attitude telling me that she goes by who ordered first. Figure out how to double task so you aren't doing everything one at a time and being productive..

Otherwise cute place!!</Text>< Pics>

Watched my coffee sit inside for about 10 mins. Was super watery and not good at all.</text>

Very friendly barista playing Taylor Swift, had lots of knowledge about where we were headed and what to do in the surrounding area. An excellent cup of chai to boot!< /review>

Great coffee shop with friendly folks behind the counter. We arrived at 7:03 one morning and they were all set and ready to go. Excellent pumpkin drinks for fall and don't miss the griddled doughnut! We went every day of our time in Three Rivers.<//review>

Love this coffee! It’s absolutely delicious! Definitely a “must stop” on your way to and from Sequoia National Park! Such a cute little shop with a sophisticated vibe that is rare in such a small town. Service is fast and the friendly staff is super helpful if you have any questions about the National Park. Can’t wait to go there again!< /review>

The only thing this place really had going for it was river access.  Now they have closed that because somebody broke a bottle.  Skip it and go to the buckaroo diner next door.<//Review>

< Review>
Very happy with my experience at Orchard Dental. I wasn't a patient but they were able to fit me in for an emergency appointment within a day of calling them. And if that wasn't great enough, there was no pain with the numbing shot and tooth extract. I'll be going back soon to become a permanent patient. Thank you to Dr. Wallace and the other friendly staff I met in my brief visit.</Review>

He does not suggest procedures that are not necessary. His hygienists are excellent. I love the way Julie bills. She always bills the insurance first so I don’t pay anything until I know what the insurance pays. I have sent friends to him and they are equally impressed. Great job Dr. Wilson and staff!<//Review></record>

< Review>
Dr. Grady and his assistant Lolly are wonderful.  Other dentists seem more concerned about how much money they can make out of your mouth, and are too quick to drill or fix.  Dr. Grady has always taken a conservative approach to make sure you really need a procedure before doing it.  And when procedures are done, they combine to make them pain free, professional and efficient.< /Review>

Everyone at Orchard Dental group has given us great care. My husband and I go there even though they are out of network for our insurance because we value the care we get and how professional everyone is.  Totally worth it!  Even recommended our grown children to them, and they feel the same.<//Text>

<Text>I love Orchard Dental and specifically Dr. Grady, Lolly, and Kim. I have been going there for years and years. I recently started the process for a crown on one of my molars. Dr. Grady and Lolly were so caring and kind when the grinding process began because they knew how anxious I was. I will continue going there for as long as I need a dentist and hygienist. Everyone who works there is so professional. Even the waiting room is special - so comfortable with a fish tank and good magazines to read while you wait.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><rate>5< /rate></record></dataset><record>

<response>None</response><Text>Everyone at Orchard Dentistry is always friendly and skillfully professional.  They fully explain one's personal situation and options available  and if you're in a tight spot, they're always reasonable.

For example, my retiring after only a few years of full time work, Dr Wallace said  my teeth and mouth were in basically good shape and, maybe I'd not need to carry monthly insurance. He gave me my past record of need and costs  and asked me to compare that  with paying $60+ per month. each year for insurance.   Then  decide if I could absorb an occasional big bill."    Try it for a year and see.    That was so big a thing, so helpful, and  yes, I could manage.  I've saved a lot  these last 9 years.

The whole staff is cooperative,  caring and helpful   It's simply an ideal , a very  nice atmosphere and  place  with an interesting octagonal layout. That the place is  called  Orchard Dental group is so appropriate, even nourishing.  Then if you're a senior citizen, you get  regular discounts.

I recommended my neighbor who was about to undergo implant surgery for his whole mouth to get another estimate from my dentist,  Dr. Wallace.  He did so after some heavy prodding, and was  very, very happy  he saved some thousands on the inplants he needed.   And like me and many others, he really liked the place, the people, the outcome

We have gone to Dr.Michael Wilson at Orchard Dental Group for well over 20 years and have always been pleased with his expertise, professionalism, and caring attitude.  My husband, son, and I have always received excellent treatment.  Dr. Wilson's hygienist, Michelle; Julie, his office manager; and Cece, his dental assistant are all very professional and caring.<//Review>

I have NEVER had a bad experience at Orchard Dental.  Whether it was an emergency or a planned renovation of my entire smile, I was treated with care and professional treatment.  I even brought people I found in the community to them for treatment because of their dedication to helping those in need.  In my hard times they allowed me to budget my costs and still get premium care.  Always smiling and friendly, every visit.<//review>

I am a LONG time (35+ years) customer/patient of Orchard Dental Group. I'm always very satisfied with any service I have received. The staff and doctors have all been very kind, helpful and nice. I've moved from Fair Oaks to Roseville, but I still drive to Orchard Dental Group for all dental service(s). I will never go any where else.< /text>

Dr Wilson, Dr Sutliff & everyone in this group are professional & highly skilled. They pay attention & care about even the smallest details of their work & services. I have been going to this dental group for 17 years. Their pleasant & friendly atmosphere is just "icing on the cake". I always look forward to my appointments at Orchard Dental Group.</Review>

<review>Dr Grady has been my Dentist for so many years I can't even remember! He has helped me thru several emergency  "tooth " problems lately in a timely manner. The staff know me by name, I always feel welcome and well taken care off. I trust him and the other Dentists/assistants in the office who have assisted in some way in my care when it was necessary. I have complete confidence in their hands..They are absolutely the best in my opinion....I also love the coffee/tea machine if I get there early or when I leave. The Office is always clean and organized and large enough to feel comfortable.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<text>I love Orchard Dental Group. I have been with this dental group since the 1980s. These are caring people who are dedicated and professional. Dr. Grady won over my husband who was anxious about seeing a dentist. Dr. Grady is extremely gentle. I am completely satisfied with every procedure I have had from repairing a broken tooth from a car accident to crowns and fillings.< /text><Time>1476160164620< /Time><gmap_id>0x809ade00744ba745:0xe31e626b660a657a</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I came here for a filling because my old dentist messed up 3 times, and Dr. Wilson fixed my filling and made me comfortable even though I had bad experiences in the past. He not only worked with my teeth but also my mind about the experience. Dr. Sutliff was my orthodontist. Great guy, he talks about life while he's working on your mouth. He explains things very well.</Review>

They're simply the best in all ways: service, honesty, professionalism, attentiveness and cost. I have trusted them to manage my dental care without any hesitation - I've never once felt I was being "sold" anything except what I needed. They don't cut corners on cleanings, either, as their hygienists do a systematic, methodical job getting your teeth in top shape. You'll never leave feeling that you got a bad haircut, for example. This group also knows how to look at your teeth with the future in mind. They have experience to foresee problems well before they happen, making them an excellent long-term care provider. Without hesitation or any reservation I wholeheartedly recommend ODG for all dental care, including orthodontics!</text><response>None<//response>< pics>

<review>Dr. Sutliff is the absolute BEST orthodontist I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with.  He is a kind, compassionate, and just overall wonderful human being too.  He treated both of my boys who were difficult cases and did an amazing job (they both get comments on how great their smiles are). We ending up moving across country before my daughter could finish her treatment and I was so nervous about finding another orthodontist. Dr. Sutliff's staff did some research and found other providers in my new area who used the same type of system. After months of treatment with the new orthodontist I wasn't comfortable with what I was hearing and called Dr. Sutliff for an opinion. He took the time to personally call me back and told me to advocate for what I wanted. He said he's personally learned a lot because of parents who push back. I honestly can't say enough about this wonderful man and all he has done for our family.</review><response>None</response><user_name>Rachel Miller<//user_name>< date>

The staff is always personable and professional.  Even though I moved further away from the practice several years ago, I continue to receive my dental care from this provider.< /review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>First impression I had with Orchard Dental was friendly staff and peaceful place. The office location is off the busy path of Sunrise Blvd but it is easily located. Parking was a breeze because the office was not sharing the parking with any other businesses.
Dr. Russell Sutliff was wonderful. I was looking for an Ortho Dental place for a while and finally decided to have my braces done by Dr. Sutliff. He is super friendly, knowledgeable, relaxed,  and a good sense of humor. I like Dr. Sutliff the most in his open communication. He keeps his patient informed of all his procedures and is willing to explain as much as he can so his patient would feel comfortable with the procedures. He takes time with his patient in each appointment whether it was only a routine checkup on the brace wires. Dr. Sutliff is delicate to his patient and passionate about his profession.
My braces were taken off right at two years timeline in Dec 2016. I also paid off all the Ortho dental fee. Last month Jan 2017, I had a followup appointment with Dr. Sutliff and he still treated me the same as before. Nothing was rushed and I still saw a big welcoming smile on his face. His attitude did not change a bit just because I paid off all my fees. I greatly appreciate this.
I never wrote such a long review before. A bit about myself, I am married and I am a full time employee with full time school and two young boys. I am super busy and kind of picky as well. However, Orchard Dental Group or Dr. Sutliff specifically is well worth the time I wrote this review. Their office might not be on your convenient route on your daily travel path nor the cheapest dental office in the Sacramento area, but their excellent services make up for everything else. I enjoyed my painless and relaxing treatment time. And I am and will be happy with my nice straight teeth for decades to come.</Text>< pictures>

I have been with Orchard Dental Group for 30 years!  Wow!.  I started out with them when I was 26.  I liked Dr. Wilson and Dr. Sutliff so much that, whrn I got married, I got my husband to visit Orchard.  And then, once we had kids, they became patients of both Dr. Wilson and Dr. Sutliff as well.  Even though we moved to Galt years ago, we are willing to drive to Fair Oaks to see everyone at Orchard; they're like family.  We love Orchard Dental Group's comany and they have always shown us that they love us.
Thanks Orchard!< /Review>

< Review>
US Storage Montrose is the best self-storage around!  Great, friendly service from the management and staff, very clean, well-maintained facility.   The manager, Ismael, and assistant manager, Robert, make the leasing process easy!  Added bonus-they play some great music while you take care of your storage needs!!  Rock on US Storage Montrose!!</Review>

<review>This is a hidden gem for us in the LCF/La Crescenta/Montrose area. It is exceptionally clean, easy to access and has a wonderful array of options. But most importantly, Ismael, who worked in the office, was incredibly kind, patient and accommodating in helping me choose the best storage unit to store our seasonal stuff. I would highly recommend this facility to all residents in our community. Glad to have a clutter free garage!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80c2ea0dc503794f:0xdf925a4625b7fe33</GmapID></record>

<Text>My sister was going through a pretty rough patch. She dropped out of school and quit her job to try to go viral on social media. For a while it wasn't working out and she had to move out of her apartment. Lots of other storage companies (who always claim they're better) didn't want her to take her stuff in. I worked with Noah who was very dedicated to giving us the best service possible and even went out of his way to help us understand all the paperwork. God willing she will get to a better place since at the moment her foot is handicapped.All in all we had a great experience here and it's all thanks to small acts of kindness from employees like the ones at US Storage. Thank you for your service Noah.</Text>< username>

This facility is open, clean, and has awesome customer service! Robert Bittle was so helpful and hooked me up by reserving a unit in advance. He always goes above and beyond to help everyone and is very thorough throughout the whole process. This is the best place around by far trust me i checked haha.< /Review>

I’ve been using this facility for many years. Just opened up a new unit today, & Robert made the process so easy. He was very helpful & knowledgable, & I love the clean & always well-kept facility. They have lots of security features, & helpful staff.<//Text>

US STORAGE IN MONTROSE CA.
This is the best storage unit that I have ever rented. The units are clean and even during the hot summer days, the units remained rather cool and comfortable ( without even climate control!)
Ishmael was very professional, thorough and sweet. He has a very personable attitude.
The storage facility is located in a very nice neighborhood that is safe.
When you call this facility to inquire about a unit for rent, I highly recommend asking for Ishmael
Anne Marie young recommends this place and I rate it a 10<//Review>

My last experience with a storage company was devastating. Never in my life had i faced such a rigmarole. It was as if my relationship with storage centers was on life support, and i had no idea how i was to survive such a catastrophic event. Luckily a man named Noah, who i now consider to be a dear friend, helped me to endure. He recommended me this place and never in my life would i have expected myself to feel so secure with my storage in the hands of another, truly my faith in these facilities have been restored. Thank you noah, i will never forget you.< /text>

Easy to use drive up units. Affordable and convenient. When you visit make sure to ask for Ishmael! He got me in and out in like 10 minutes. He's super nice too! If you ask for a discount I guarantee he's going to try and work something out to keep you happy< /Text>

Excellent storage center. Been using this place for 1.5 years and never had a problem. My stuff is safe and elevator/carts makes accessing my stuff so easy. The owners are so friendly and helpful. If you need help joining ask Ismael! He is patient and kind and will help you get the best storage solution you need :)< /review>

I was looking for a storage unit near where I live now and I spoke with property manger Ismael Jauregui , and I was very pleased with his helpfulness and knowledgeable about the storage facility, he even should me how to try to rent unit on- line in my phone but I keep getting an error. Ishmael asked me he’ll try to find the reason for the error and he did and everything worked out . I am so glad they have Ishmael for the property manager I know my unit is safe and secure. Thank you US Storage</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I spent most of the day at u.s storage in montrose. I was in a pickle and needed to transfer my storage into another storage half the size. It was very challenging for me. But I had Robert. Robert works at US storage and he is the sweetest, kindest and most helpful young man I have encountered in a long while. Robert went completely out of his way to do what he could to help me. He advised me of my options and was most helpful in the process. Aside from Robert, the facility itself is very clean and secure. I have been involved with other storage facilities but I will always come here from now on. I would highly recommend US Storage in Montrose to meet your storage needs without a doubt.</review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80c2ea0dc503794f:0xdf925a4625b7fe33<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

We have done long term rentals keeping medical records from a medical office for archiving to just recently using bigger spaces to hold stuff while we remodel our house. Love, love, love the location. Super easy access. On a quite street just off the major thoroughfare of major freeways of 210 & 2. Super fast in and out and great staff.<//text>< pictures>

The facility is spotless.
Mary is by far the most amazing, courteous and thoughtful  person I've come across in a long time. When my movers forgot some very important items they leaned on the wall outside and around the corner of the unit they emptied, she went out of her way to put them in their personal storage and called me immediately instead of leaving them there for hours for someone else to take.
No question,  that's going above and beyond exceptional customer service.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<text>I would definitely recommend this place to everyone! They are definitely the best deal you can find even if you are storing a large items ). I look around and I called so many places in Los Angeles for pricing when I was moving, the prices they were giving me were ridiculous. It was such a relief when I found US Storage Centers.  The people that work there are very nice, very willing to help in every way and extremely polite and helpful. If your needing to find a storage location long term as I was, this is the place to go!!</text>< Pics>

I highly recommend this place for what ever you need to keep in a storage!< /text><GmapID>0x80c2ea0dc503794f:0xdf925a4625b7fe33< /GmapID><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Date>

With it being my first time I had a great experience, that was because of Mary she helped me find my friend's space and had a great personality. She always had a smile and kept me laughing. If I would need to store in the future I would come back here just cause of her.

<Text>Service was great and accommodating.  Ismael gave me all of the information I needed over the phone to make my decision to use this storage facility. Both Maria and Ismael made the process of contracting a unit pleasant and easy.  Highly recommend to others interested in good old fashioned customer service and a clean and safe storage facility.< /Text>< Pics>

Since I had last been here, the sign up process has quadrupled making it very frustrating, please update your software. Secondly, while going on-line, I've come to find out that other U.S. Storage facilities have 24/7  access, would it be too difficult to manage here?

I have had 3 units in this facility for over 10 years and now have 4. The
staff are friendly & helpful, especially Mary. It is very secure
facility & they have good hours (past 5:00pm). They also have
dollies you can borrow on site to help move your stuff. All & all a
good place.</review>

I give U.S. Storage Center in Montrose a 10-star rating.
The customer service is friendly and professional and
they go out of their way to make sure you are well
taken care of and also give you the best possible
price for your money.  This is my third time using
this storage facility and will definitely return again
because they are the best!!!!!</Review>

After I complained enough about it,  they put off the increase until after a year is up.  I will probably go to a less expensive place close by if they really do raise it that much.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Great facility and great staff!  After checking out several other facilities I was getting very discouraged.  Other facilities I checked out were totally unacceptable; then I checked out US Storage in Montrose.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  The storage units are roomy with nice high ceilings and very clean and well built.  Mary (the assistant manager) was terrific, showing me the different options available and helping me to choose the best option for me.  I am very happy that I found this facility!< /review>

The property is clean and well protected and the staff is most friendly and very professional. Ismael and Mary have made sure to find the best deal for my storage money. Thank you for protecting my possessions and for being available whenever I've had a question or concern. Real pro's!!</review><user>108199654809066047984<//user><name>Dan Jordan</name>< Gmap_id>

This was my first time using a storage facility.  I called around for prices, sizes, and location.  The customer service was friendly and very helpful. Ismael and his staff
made  the choice easy, and I would absolutely recommend the Montrose location to anyone looking for storage.< /Text>

<Review>I have to hand it to these guys. They handled a tough situation with class when the contents of my two storage units were under a lot of scrutiny during a difficult divorce. Working with the office, they were professional and up front about their policies (and stuck to them), when they could have very easily done otherwise.

I am a long-time customer of US Storage in Montrose, Ca. I have used their facility three times since 1998. The property is clean and well protected and the staff is most friendly and very professional. Ismael and Mary have made sure to find the best deal for my storage money. Thank you for protecting my possessions and for being available whenever I've had a question or concern. Real pro's!!< /text>

<Review>This is a a beautifully run center...they have everything you could possibly need including a very large elevator and moving supplies and I really appreciate the e-mailed payment reminder each month so I am never late. And the staff are extremely kind, professional and accomodating. Very easy access as well.<//Review>< user>

US Storage Centers is clean and appropriately climate controlled to offer a safe and secure place to store your selected belongings. I highly recommend them as a storage facility at the MONTROSE location and highly recommend asking for Ismael Jauregui who is courteous, professional and delivers excellent customer service consistently. This location is best one I’ve seen, used in LA. Highly recommend the MONTROSE location/ (vhughes).</review>

<text>While my family home was under construction I used this US storage Center location as a place to store all our belongings for over 3 years.  I searched everywhere and went to multiple storages in the area before choosing the Montrose Location. I can not be more pleased.  Ismal (the property manager) was amazing from day one.  He never got frustrated as I went back and forth multiple times to show me units before making my final choice, even when I did I asked him to keep me in mind if another unit in a different area opened up and sure enough he called me 3 months later and asked if i wanted to take it.  I've always felt that my items have been safe and in cool temperatures while at this storage unit.  i remember losing my key and Ismal being super cool about cutting my lock.  They have cold mineral water at the entry, a clean bathroom and plenty of carts to help move boxes.  You can even have items shipped to the location.   Five star all the way and thank you Ismal for top notch service!< /text><Time>1533340721064<//Time>< Resp>

I went to enquire for storage about a week ago and was greeted by Mary as soon as I drove in the parking lot as she was sweeping the front of the location. Her warm welcome made me feel at home as all of you know how stressful looking for storage is. She showed me a couple spaces and and I couldn't help but notice how clean this location is. Mary has tremendous knowledge of storage and actually showed me how to stack furniture/boxes(me beign a guy would of thrown everything in)to save me money. When we came back to the office she showed me the vast selection of boxes which I did go ahead and purchase some. I did not commit to renting the unit on the spot because I need to speak to my partner  and I want to be packed so we know exactly what size to get. When I'm ready to rent I'll make sure I look for Mary to rent from her. She is a great asset to your company.</Review>

Simply, We were so impressed with the  manager, his  customer service was exceptional.. He was very profesional, and patient, he answered all our questions, and he showed us 3 diferent sizes and gave us some suggestions how to take advantage of the space and save money. It was a great Experience. I will recomend it to my family members and friendsfor sure. Elvi P.</Text>
