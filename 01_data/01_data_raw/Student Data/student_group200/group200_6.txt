<pics>None< /pics><review>Every time you enter in Lush the fragrance you smell is DELICIOUS 😋
It's very tempting to eat these bath and body products but don't get fooled by the shape and fragrances, we are talking about shampoo, soap, lotions, and make up, as well as actual perfumes.
You have to get there at least one time to discover it foe yourself. Be ready to pay the high price of an organic, vegan, cruelty free brand that take care of the planet, their employees, and their clients 😀
Love this place ❤💕</review><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I love lush. BUT NOT THIS ONE!
Long line, not a lot of stuff and no testers and no probes for 99% of items. Also, they gave us just 1 probe of moisturizer (look at photo) and this is so funny... because I was in other lush many times and other gave us full small jars every time...
So upset of service.<//Text>

Lush in Century City mall is the best! Go on Thursday afternoons when they get a shipment of fresh refrigerated face masks. Always fully stocked on every thing else. Wonderful staff!!<//text>

Seven different employees came up to me at this small store. I wore a mask, I waited in line without complaints, I washed my hands, and I had antibacterial gel ready and available on my keychain.

I had three employees try to ask me what I wanted before I had even entered the store because they wanted me to be checked out without entry. They let everyone else in with a smile.

A woman and her daughter who were ahead of me were greeted kindly; no soap was given to them to wash their hands.

They were not harassed when they went inside, and they were given time to look at items.

I used to love LUSH.

LUSH products used to be perfect for Christmas gifts in my book. Also, a great Stock.

I have used the Ayesha mask and got my family hooked onto Dream Cream.

I just wanted to look around at their new stuff and buy presents.

My experience here was Discriminatory and Revolting. I will not be buying LUSH ever again.< /Text>

Lush has a soap with a feeling and smell that lasts years. Not physically ofcourse, but mentally. Whenever I get the soap again, as I lather with what I could only call a facial but for my body (its that nice) I instantly remember the times before. 2015, 2016..etc.  The smell brings back not only memories but feelings, comfortable feelings. No other soap has triggered such nostalgia. That's why I give this 5 star rating 😊. (Its the soap shaped as a Bee by the way hehe)< /Text>

Yes to the way LUSH has reopened! There are tables immediately inside the store. Customers stand behind these tables while the staff brings out products upon request. Social distancing is a must for fighting covid and what better way to provide great service than through direct tableside service for each customer. A+. The salesperson who assisted me today, Katie, was knowledgable, friendly, and professional! Thank you for your help today!</Review>

This is one the biggest, friendliest and most organized beauty supply stores I have ever been to. I don't know what the standard is on the west coast but on the east coast, a spot like this would be considered heaven.<//Review>

I love that they are vegan, do not test on animals, and do not use any harsh products! All of their items even show you who created the product! I think it adds a nice personal touch, and a fun factor to your experience.

Some of the things I consistently buy are the face masks! If you collect 5 containers, they will give you one free mask! The bath bombs are also very nice, fragrant and filled with wonderful essential oils. The facial cleansers come in all different textures and the staff will help you find the right one!

Whether you’re looking for bath products, cleansers, lotions, or masks! Definitely check out Lush! They will be more than happy to provide you a small sample of their product as well, if you find that you’re interested in something that they have available!< /text>< Pics>

Tracy helped me pick out my shampoo bar. She also gave me some samples. Tracy is really nice and she helped me pick out stuff for my hair and more. Someone also helped me pick out things I need for my hair. She first told me what type of skin i have and she helped me. I think her name was Lizzet or Lindsey (I’m not sure sorry) but she helped me and I use them like everyday. I really love this store and it’s so huge and the staff members are really nice<//Review>< user>

Recommending the golden bath bomb that changes colors within it. It's shaped like a cube. I think it was more seasonal if anything. The Buffy is the best soap I've had. The ex loves this stuff.. Let alone this place... Lol</Text>

This is a great location -- everyone is friendly here, as they are at every Lush we have ever shopped at.

The great thing about Lush is that it is mostly the same wherever you go in U.S. -- but they don't have the same selections as Europe.  My wife was lucky enough to pick up some of their European products while on a business trip!<//Review>

The doctors are wonderful. The doctors do great work. I had a tooth 🦷next to the root canal that was very very loose. I thought I was going to loose the tooth and I had no more insurance left and no money. Dr. Stanic had my tooth 🦷fixed with a root canal and filling at no charge. This is a perfect example of Human Kindness!!! He is the best dentist I have ever had the pleasure of knowing ☺🙏. The staff and other dentists are also very knowledgeable and helpful the sweetest ❤people. The dental office is super super clean and sterile, they even have a big nice air purifier. I definitely feel safe from Covid-19 at this office, they do it right. I absolutely love 🥰this dental office and would never choose to go anywhere else.😁 Thank you and God bless Sequoia Dental Office!!!< /text>

I have nothing but great things to say about this Dental Office. All the staff were very polite and helpful. I was just visiting family in town and they were able to get me in for multiple issues and completed all the work I needed in a span of three days. Everything went very smooth and I’d 100% recommend this office for any dental work needed.<//review>

All staff are nice, friendly and helpful. The covid check when you get there is quick and easy when the questionnaire has been filled out ahead of time online. They are also curious to your needs and help make your experience comfortable (including the hygienist since most time will be spent during your checkup with this person). Overall, you are in an out in a timely manner (while on cutting corners on your visit) to minimize your contact with others or as few people as necessary. I recommend this dental office.</review>< Pics>

<Review>I absolutely recommend sequoia dental. All staff from the front office to the drs are exceptionally friendly and welcoming. My personal experience having my wisdom teeth removed was exceptional. I did not feel one ounce of pain throughout the whole procedure. I didn’t even feel the needle used to numb my mouth. The dentist took his time to make sure I was comfortable and completely numb. However the process was fast and I drove home with a smile on my face.</Review><Gmap_id>0x809526237abf42f3:0x1ecffa1cac171510</Gmap_id>< user>

Only thing I didn't like was the doctor found that I needed 2 crowns and 4 fillings which could not have happened in 6 months from my last visit. And the hygienist said that I didn't have a plaque build up and was doing a good job brushing and flossing. Also my teeth didn't hurt. I think someone wanted some money. I was also there for 2 hrs just for a checkup and cleaning</text>

The service at Dr. StanicDentist‘s dental office was amazing! I was able to get in the next day for my appointment for my snoring! I am currently undergoing treatment for this and have seen some improvement after one day. I look forward to more improvement over the next few days. The process was totally painless and easy!< /Review>

One of the if not the most welcoming staff. Very clean office space, the staff and Doctors went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable and welcomed. I had a bit of anxiety when entering the office but that quickly went away as the staff exceed my needs and expectations. Would highly recommend referring my friends and family to this office.<//Text>

They also open at 7:30am which is awesome for someone who needs care asap. I was in so much pain the night before and they quickly saw me and prescribed medication to start the correct antibiotics and pain relievers.

<text>I love this office, everyone’s very nice. Ruben who did my X-rays was excellently. He’s so attentive, he continually asked if I was ok or if I needed anything. I saw the dentist briefly since I had no cavities or anything of concern with my teeth.  The young dental hygienist ( sorry I can’t remember her name) was excellent. She cleaned my teeth throughly with no pain or discomfort . They always send the patients home with some coconut water (which I love),toothbrush, toothpaste and floss. The wait is very short, II definitely recommend it.<//text>< response>

<text>The visit was nice and in line with COVID -19 guidelines.  Was expecting more of a distancing between patients in waiting room and in exam area.   The RDH was professional and took all the necessary precautions to protect her and me.  The exam went well and my checkout was great.  Came in front and went out the back side door.

I have been going to Sequoia dental for 15+ years and they are absolutely the best in visalia. Dentists used to give me anxiety now i actually look forward to my cleanings.  And when you find a hygienist whom you really like you can request them.  (Brittany does my teeth)😀</review>

Very cautious with Covid virus. Staff is friendly and kind. All the Dentists are very gentle, caring and extremely helpful. The offIce is very nice and clean. I had a deadline with my insurance and quite a bit of work to do. The Dentists all came together to work up a plan for me. I would not hesitate to recommend them.<//review>

<Review>The office took several precautions regarding the covid 19 virus before letting me in. They asked several questions & took my temp. Everyone was wearing masks. Dr. Burgess was very kind and patient. I get REALLY nervous. She explained everything she was doing & checked with me to make sure I was ok throughout the process (4 fillings). She did a GREAT job. I didn't feel any pain during or after the filings. I was out in 1 hr and 45 min including the questionnaire & payment. I definitely recommend this office.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><gmap_id>0x809526237abf42f3:0x1ecffa1cac171510</gmap_id>< Rating>

Dr Burgess and her assistants Nora and Myra were and are amazing! Great team work!! My daughter needed a frenectomy on her upper lip, and rather than having it done the traditional way, Stan the man aka Dr. Stanic 😊 showed me the New and much more improved way of having it done with the laser! No cutting no bleeding no stitches, and more importantly no down time it is amazing...beautiful work! My daughters lip is now free and her speech has improved DRAMATICALLY!! Thank you so much.< /Review>

First a little dental backstory for me. I'm one of those "lucky" people that has to self medicate before a dentist appointment because of anxiety. At the dentist I went to before Sequoia Dental it took a full year of regular appointments for me to finally be able to be seen without the use of nitrous. It isn't the pain so much as it is the noises associated with the dentist's office and the feeling of vulnerability  that happens when the exam chair gets reclined back. Now that brings me to my appointment yesterday at Sequoia Dental. It was an emergency appointment as I was experiencing acute pain from one of my crowns. The staff was very nice and was very closely following social distancing recommendations. Xrays were a breeze and the first doctor I met with was a nice older gentleman. He said I'd need a root canal, new post and a crown. I was tempted to just have him pull it because of the cost but other than needing some TLC the tooth is a good one so I opted to go through with the root canal, post and crown. The next doctor I met with is the reason I'm taking the time to write this review. He was amazing. I felt no pain, nada, 0, zilch. The shots to numb me didn't even hurt. Between getting through the shots pain free and him continuously checking in on me I was more comfortable than I have ever been at a dentist. Thank you Dr. Bui.< /text>

I have always had an amazing experience at Sequoia Dental. They have an all around friendly staff. I personally like Jennifer, one of the hygienists, she always takes her time when cleaning my teeth and provides me with great hygiene tips for harder to reach areas. Dr. Burgess always makes me feel comfortable when she works on my teeth. She tends to be a perfectionist, which I love. She also did an amazing job when she performed my pinhole surgery. All around a great experience. Thank you.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1619224538036, 'text': 'Jan your detailed review is so appreciated!

I went here for a cavity that was hurting.  They got me in the next day. This was the 1st positive dental visit, ever in my life. Everyone from the x-ray technician,  Dr. Stanic who explained my x-rays, Dr. Bui who perfomed the root canal, to Patricia the dental hygienist were all so professional and genuinely seemed to care. They all kept asking me if I was ok throughout the whole visit. Dr. Bui took his time to make sure I was not in pain. The result was that I wasn't in pain. Even after the numbing wore off I only felt minor discomfort. I'm 1000% sure this was because he was so careful. I will be going back. I think I finally found my dentist!!

UPDATE- I went back for fillings. They used thr laser. I felt them doing things in my mouth and I felt cold air at times but no pain during or after the procedure. It took an hour for 3 fillings.<//Review>

I used to fear coming to the dentist but not anymore! The staff here is always very friendly from the time I come in, to the hygienists, to the dentist, all very professional and courteous. I definitely recommend to anyone who is searching for a great dental facility.< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>The staff at Sequoia Dental are always professional, cordial and supportive.  I've been going there as a patient since 2003 and I've had consistently good experiences and competent treatment - ranging from general check-ups and X-rays, fillings, cleanings, crowns, and implants.  Over these years, I've seen them work hard to incorporate the latest technologies into their practice, both through their front office and in the chair.  They offer a variety of services as well.  I would recommend them highly.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Review>Been coming here for 24 years and the staff talks badly about one another while doing your teeth! Long wait times! Appointment was at a certain time and waited in the lobby for 1 hour as they took a walk in before me and someone else who had appointments!! They never get my insurance right either! Over billed me more than once because they failed to update my insurance in their computers!! They have also canceled on me for their dr to leave the office early! They didn’t tell me my dr wasn’t seeing me one day yet my chart specifically says ONLY a certain dr in this place! He dr called in sick, so why didn’t they call me and tell me or make me aware of it when walking in!!?? Will be looking into a new dentist</Review><resp>{'time': 1548175844728, 'text': 'We are sorry that we caused you to feel that way. We appreciate your loyalty for all of these years. Unfortunately emergencies do happened to Doctors too. Our patients are seen based on their specific dental needs, appointment and which provider they are scheduled to see. This does not harmonize with patients arrival sequence, each patient requires a different amount of time for each procedure, which can be unpredictable.\nOh yes, the insurance frustration we feel and deal with it everyday, but as hard as it is to be correct every time we do try to be as efficient and as thorough as possible. Sorry for the frustration with them as well.\nYou are welcome to come back if you reconsider.\nThank you,\nDr. Stanic'}</resp>< date>

< review>
I would absolutely NOT recommend this practice. I went in with tooth sensitivity and they took 1 quick X-ray that the dentist looked at for 2 seconds and told me to use sensodine. Then, I was called repeatedly the next week to come back to see the dentist again... not sure why I obliged, but I did. Then I was told I needed a root canal on a tooth that already has a root canal and was shown an xray that clearly had a cavity, not a completed root canal. So weather the xrays were switched with another patient or it was an intentional bait and switch, I’m not sure, but it was the worst dental experience I’ve ever had. Please do NOT waste your money and time like I did!!!</review>

Called to see if I could make an appointment same day Unfortunately they weren't able to get me in. The nurse asked what I needed an appointment for and I explained my situation to her. She placed me on hold to ask the dentist and when she came back she informed me I didn't need to make an appointment I could just come in and pick up a syringe free of charge. When I Arrived she had it ready for with directions. Much Appreciated!<//Review>

This was my first visit. I thought the staff was efficient. Wait time was about what I expected. Wish I would of had someplace to sit my purse down I held it in my lap the whole time. I really liked Dr. Bui. He was straight to the point but nice. I have to go back to get a crown.
Follow up ....went for a cleaning during this time of COVID. The screening was excellent. Staff was great. Thank you.<//review>

I was pleased with this place and the staff is amazing, however lately Stanic is not doing his job. He rescheduled my appointment because he had a headache and the most recent is when he refused to treat my sons dental issues although we have great insurance. I'm done with him!!</Review>

Then when my son's name was finally called they said they couldn't do the root canal at this visit. We would have to schedule an appointment for that. I was furious. No, thank you.. To wait for a hour and half in the waiting room to be see again. When I complained the staff really didn't seem to care.. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO SEQUOIA DENTAL AGAIN !!!!!!<//Text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) When they know that you have 2 different insurances instead of healing, they give you more appointments to charge more

Best experience I’ve had with an insurance agent. Angela was so kind and easy to talk to. I’ve got the best insurance price I’ve had in years and they cover so much! Really surprised and blessed to have found Unity Path Insurance services!<//text>

Have been uninsured for almost 2 years, and Unity Path still had me listed under an agent, who made the process to get coverage a very simple and affordable one. Thank you guys. Can’t recommend enough<//text>

<Text>I signed up for insurance using unity path after getting outrageous quotes from other big name companies that just weren’t reasonable. I have worked with Freshta throughout the process, and she continues to be helpful and attentive every time I call. I would definitely recommend her and Unity Path to anyone looking for a professional and affordable auto insurance company and policy.</Text><userid>102811391519017153771<//userid><date>1611171157984< /date>< gmapID>

I absolutely love this insurance company, I found them awhile back when I first got my car... I’d be happier once the website is up so I can be able to navigate things myself., but over great customer service each time I call. Thanks Cindy<//review>

I just signed up with Fresca today. She was really helpful, got me the best price for my car. I just started it today, so we will see how Aspire goes. But Unity Path Insurance staff was friendly and helpful every time I called and asked questions. I like how she broke down what the price was and how it works. And she even got me roadside assistance, which is a plus. I will rate it again in around 6 months, just to make sure I get a really good feel overall. For now it was a good experience.<//Review>

Fast and friendly service. I was shopping around for a  quote on a new car I just purchased and these guys really came through as the best option if you are looking for a no bs quote with the best price call and ask for  Angela she is definitely on top of her game<//review>

< Review>
I've never heard of that Insurance company in my life..... These people are real shady I have insurance I don't know how they got my card number but they went into my bank account and took $178 and if they don't put it back in my bank I'm going to talk to a lawyer and I'm going to assume five nights and I'll get five times that 178 I think they target old people but they got the wrong target I'm aware of scam artists and shady people stay away from now run run the other way as fast as you can don't deal with these people..<//Review>

I will never do business with them again! The agents are incompetent! I ask my agent Freshta questions about my policy and she doesn't know the answers,  she is suppose to get back to me on certain issues, and she never does.  Very bad customer service!! I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy!! F+++< /Review>

Not only do they provide horrible customer service, but they keep putting fliers on my car (three today alone). People throw the papers on the ground creating piles of litter. This practice is very impractical!</Text>

Horrible agents. They made a mistake on my policy, filing the wrong address and I did tell the lady Frestha the she put the wrong address and she told and texted me she would fix that, then she didn't  also I asked to have my auto pay set up and she told me on the phone it would be done, in the end she didn't fixed the wrong address,  didn't put my bill in auto pay,  my insurance was canceled,  she didn't have me a notice about,  I had a hit and run on my car and I was without insurance,  I called her to ask if I have a rental car in my policy and she didn't even check if my policy was OK, when I filed the claim at the insurance company was when they told me that my policy was canceled  by no payment, and I wasn't receiving the bill because my address was wrong I tried to get a deal for they use their E&O policy to fix my car and they hide like cowards. Don't deal with this people , was the worst service and also liers.< /Review>

<Text>Avoid like the plague. Hidden fees will cause your estimate to almost double and the insurance companies are complete trash. You will never leave this place feeling like you have been taken care of. Avoid at all cost. No insurance is better than Buzy Bees.</Text>< Pics>

<review>Excellent experience. Sarah was awesome. So helpful and sensitive to my concerns about covid. She set a chair outside before I got there and brought the tablet outside for me to complete the registration. Great service from her. And the facility is what you hope for...clean, well-lighted, easy access, secure. Opening the gate with a phone app is a bonus. Very highly recommended.<//review>< pictures>

I came in to Public Storage Rancho San Diego at the last minute.  I received outstanding customer service from Rachel.  She made easy in order the proper size of unit in store and maximize space and save money.

Outstanding service.<//Text>

I had to store my possessions and needed a good facility in which to do so. This was a tough time in my life. Bailey helped me every step of the way, didn't rush me and was very caring and considerate. I feel my things are safe here, and the personnel are awesome!</Review>

I enjoyed the help over the phone, she was great but, her name is Sarah. Then when I came in person, it was different, it just felt short. I wasn't shown around only pointed to where location of unit may be and really didn't feel the customer service was good in person,  I was disappointed. I only stayed for 3 weeks or so and found a better deal at another location and staff were more helpful in person.< /text>

BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE EVER SEEN at a storage facility!!!

Laretha is AWESOME!!! I have a public storage here and she went out of her way, above and beyond to help me. She not only answered my questions and concerns, but showed a compassionate heart, AND made multiple trips in the hot Sun while providing customer service. She also offered me use of the complimentary dolly - something I was unaware of when moving in. Definitely an AMAZING team member.

Hannah has a wonderful spirit and jovial attitude. When a unit I reserved online was given to another person before I moved in, she made sure to address not only the concern but also to make sure I was taken care of right away. She worked with me the same day to make sure everything was addressed and taken care of the exact same day, resolving the concern to the best of her ability.

STAFF HERE IS AWESOME! You can't pay someone enough for their customer service!

Storage wise:

- Super Safe location (which is important for me, as I left another storage because it was not as safe)

- Very Clean

- Daily Hours to visit your storage are great too (6a-9p) Longer than I've seen at others.

Definitely consider keeping your items here. My wife did about 5 years ago when we needed it, and it's still a quality storage even today.<//Review>

5 stars for Sarah, I believe that was her name
I was quoted a price online and she was able to reserve a space for me and showed it to me prior to the contract. I was on the fence but she was able to explain very thoroughly and in detail.

Note: This location does require you to purchase a lock ($20) and monthly insurance ($15). Plus Admin fees is ($24). Monthly insurance covers $5000 in damages for $15 a month but I haven’t read to much into what it actually covers. But overall good experience.</text>

I walked in on Wednesday the 30th regarding storage spots Sarah was very polite and caring.  Her spaces were full so she directed me to other areas of public storage.  Her office and area was very clean and she was well advices of the 6 ft away notice.  I felt save and not concerned of anything.</Review>

LaRetha from Public Storage personally called me and helped me get a bigger unit to fit my needs. She was very polite, patient and helpful!

When I arrived to unload, I met Sarah Schuster the manager and she so accommodating and pleasant. Couldn't ask for better customer service and a clean, well run storage.<//text>

<review>Sarah is very professional, courteous and helpful.

And now, I am moving out  9 months later and still very happy with the professionalism and friendliness of the staff especially Bailey. If I ever have to use storage again I highly recommend public storage on Willow Glen in Spring Valley.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<text>First time here.  Had trouble with the gate code (operator error)  lol.  LaReha was already coming out the door to help.  She was extremely helpful in showing me not only how to open the gate, but she then walked (while I drove) to my storage unit to make sure I was able to access my unit with ease.  LaReha even made me laugh a few times.

Great job Public Storage for employing great folks who care and are cheerful!  It was quite refreshing!  p.s.  Thank you for making my day, LaReha!!< /text>< UserId.>

Would recommend this place, the units are air conditioned and the floor is really smooth which makes it easy for sliding boxes. Hannah in particular was very helpful, she guided me to my mom's unit and helped me get the old lock off.<//Text>

Best customer service I have ever experienced. La Retha is unbelievably helpful, so pleasant and very knowledgeable. She is a breath of fresh air and absolutely turned my day around. She walked us around the property and made sure we understood everything while signing the contract. The workplace needs more people like her!<//Review>

Hannah helped me get situated. She was beyond great customer service; she was EXCEPTIONAL. She was so friendly and proficient. She showed me the unit I picked and carefully wrote the directions to access it.

She was AMAZING and she is a gift to anyone she does business for.

Unfortunately that is not how the story ends.
I ended up having to use their location for 6 months and unfortunately  it ended horrifically.
However, not because of Hannah.

It was another associate who gave the absolute opposite service that Hannah offered, whom I had to deal with for the last couple of months.  This other associate was aggressive, rude, unable to explain the terms to me when they kept raising their rates and to say she was rude is an understatement.

I recommend only if you need to use short-term, otherwise you will not be pleased and it will cause undue stress. At one point I was considering litigation because of the associate's behavior.
Fortunately I was able to speak to a manager and we resolved the issue.

I am giving this a 5 star rating in spite of my horrifying exchange with the other employee, who I have come to find out is thankfully no longer at that location.  Hannah's customer service skills and communication skills are so superb it would be unjust for me to not reflect it in my rating.
My desire is to shine on and commend her.

Additionally, I appreciate the understanding and resolution that finally came from the general manager of that location after he and I had multiple discussions.  I can say that ultimately he translated to me his concern for my satisfaction.

With that said, however, the service I received from the other employee, who they are very well aware of, was unacceptable and it causes me angst to think of it.</text>

Laretha was amazing checking me into my storage unit! Her warm personality + customer service was top notch. She even catered to my two boys and kept them entertained while I signed paperwork which made things go smooth + quickly! Thank you for making a stressful moment less stressful for me.

LaRetha customer service was excellent she is very knowledgeable informative about he job. She went over and beyond helping me with the details.
She deserves to have a raise base on the information and courtesy she provides to everyone.</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>If you come during business hours and the door is closed, it just means they are showing someone a unit and they lock the office doors when they do this. Just be patient and someone will show up soon. I don't have a storage unit here but I know someone who has a storage unit with a Public Storage in Los Angeles. They are going through some rough times so I wanted to pay for their unit.

I went to my local Public Storage and dealt with LaRetha. She was extremely helpful, kind and understanding. She processed the payment for me, made sure I had a receipt since the receipt is usually emailed to the unit holder and she went out of her way to try to help me figure out if it would be possible to pay for a lock at this location and be able to have the person in LA pick it up at their local Public Storage unit.

Unfortunately, there was no way I could do this. But LaRetha made several phone calls to try to help me and see if we could figure out a way to make it possible. Thank you LaRetha for going out of your way, to try to help out. Your kindness and fantastic customer service is greatly appreciated!!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80d95bb7684d723b:0x50683c25af4c0dad<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The managementhere really knows how to take care of their customers as well as their employees and you can tell on the service that you get here.

This past weekend I went into the Public Storage on Willow Glen,
I was meet by Jennifer who was very nice. She showed me were my unit was at.
The property was well kept. This was the first time that I have rented storage and she was very helpful with answering all of my concerns.  She also told me how I needed to protect my belongings while they were in storage.  I would recommend Public Storage to any of my friends or family that should ever need to store any items. Jennifer is very good at what she does and is very knowledgeable.</review>

I've had two units at public storage for 2 years. As the face of Public Storage, LaRetha is a real asset. I usually see LaRetha the 1st of each month when I pay my rent. I have always found her to be personable, helpful, and knowledgeable with a good sense of humor. I give LaRetha a 10 star rating!<//text>

<review>The Property Manager "Wendy", was more than happy to answer any questions as soon as we walked through the door. Her attitude was very friendly and professional. As soon as we solve the storage unit space it was more than clean and welcoming and secure. I would recommend this place to anyone of my family and friends. Wendy was more than courteous and helpful. Whereas to other places I had looked at the same day were very disappointing in comparison. Definitely give this place a shot. PS thank you Wendy for all your help< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

My parents did too.  In the latest instance we need some temporary storage for a few months and they fixed us right up.  We bought some boxes and tape here too.  Very good facility, clean, organized, easy access.  When we no longer needed the space after six months it was very easy.  Prices are good.  If we need a space in the future this will be the first place we will look.</review>< Date>

Met with Wendy, she is super sweet and helpful. Walked me through the facilities, went out of her way to get me a unit that was closer to the door to the outside for convenience, outlined each part of the contract concisely so there were no surprises (and will be none along the way), very friendly and helpful. The facility is clean and neat, in a convenient location, lots of room to drive up close to wherever your unit is, I can't say I was looking for anything else! :-)

One thing to note, they have their own cylinder locks for the units so don't worry about buying a disk lock or what have you, you won't need it.<//text>

LaRetha Was amazing for us she did everything in her power to make our moving out easier. Her communication was amazing as well as her positive and upbeat attitude. I went in having a bad day and bad experience and she not only fixed my issues but she also made my day better. Thank you LaRetha.</text>

Natalie was a great help in helping me to decide what size of wardrobe box I needed.  Really enjoyed talking to someone who know what materials a person might required!

Excellent associates are hard to find, this is individual is should be a keeper!</Review>

Shelsey was so sweet and courteous making sure we understood all of the paper work and terms of service. I Would definitely recommend this storage unit to anyone. Make sure to keep her around my husband and I really like her and her positive attitude! :)<//Review>

Public Storage is open at 6am and closes at 9 pm. Those before and after work hours have not only been a wonderful experience, but the feeling of accommodation has been greatly appreciated.

I was attended by Jennifer who was informative. She explained the  terms policy very well and answered  most of my questions s before I could ask. She gave me all her attention and made me feel important.

Thank you so much for your services, I am greatful to be able to store my belongings with you all. And again...thank you Jeninfer for making me feel important, and giving me the feeling that my belongings are safe.</Review>

I've had a great experience with the staff at our Public Storage facility in Rancho San Diego.  My unit is clean and well-maintained, and meets all of my business needs.  More importantly, the staff is very friendly and helpful, and the facility is very well run.</Text>

Rachel was awesome, helpful, and patient
Update 2/15/17
my dad wanted to help my grandma get rent a space and use the online special and so reserved a space online using her bame and his phone number. The lady working there today (not rachel) said she can't allow any specials because my dad used his number to reserve the space for her.  She even admitted that it is better to lie to them so as to recieve better deals and treatment!  Not very good to treat customers that way.</Review>

It was raining and the girls worKing made me feel like I was bothering them.  Of course I understand them not wanting to go in the rain to show me a unit,  but imagine how frustrated I was moving in the rain! THEN I found out one I got there that my lock wasn't sufficient enough. It would've been nice to know over the phone.</Text>

I went to Public Storage to pay my storage fee, and was greeted by the employee named LaRetha. She is quite friendly, and does her job very well. I paid via personal check. And in no time, the check was processed, and my receipt was in my hands. LaRetha loves to talk about deserts available in stores. She recommended a banana pudding, recipe by soul singer Patti LaBelle, available at Walmart in the refrigerated section. I will check it out. I give a 5-Star rating.<//review>

<Review>I went to this place today at around 5 pm, which was located inside the Ralph.there were two ladies working there. I asked the one who took order if I am staying in the right spot, so she saw me and said yes! Then after the last customer left she left the front desk ( I thought she is busy, so I waited for a while) then it took longer, and I had a baby who was crying. Therefore I called her snd ask if she take order, she was like “yes, I do!” I ordered 2 short regular coffee and one coffee cake. I paid. Then she told me that they don’t have the cup sleeve. So I took them with napkins! Then I saw that she warmed up 2 cakes instead of one, I was expecting her to say something about refund or at least an apology . But she didn’t and was waiting for me to say something. I got the 2 cakes because I didn’t have the recipe  so... she was not professional. It was my first time to see unfortunately a poor customer service at the Starbucks.</Review>< pictures>

This Starbucks, like all the Starbucks in town, are under a few restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. You can go in the store and make your order. However, there is no seating inside or outside. Restrooms are closed to the general public too. Even though there aren't the usual comforts Starbucks offer, the staff was very friendly and accommodating. Like everyone, I'll be very happy when things go back to normal when the pandemic is under control. In the meantime, keep enjoying the Starbucks products while we're all waiting for normalcy to return and don't forget to wear your mask and keep healthy!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

However - Not sure about the "great views" since this is a shopping complex on the side of the i5 surrounded by apartment complexes.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< rating>

Different people seek different things at Starbucks. Here they may not have outlets for laptop for you to stay for 3hrs, but the drinks are amazing. The staff are very nice, remember returning guests, and help guest to customize their drink often without extra cost.
I came here very often and I knew some special items on the “secret menu”, especially for tea. They are very patient to help me to tailor my drink, bear with me for some “annoying” requirements.<//review>

I order via the app before work and my drink is always well made and ready when I get there. It's not a huge store and the line can get long in the morning but I've never seen every table full. My only complaint is that the parking lot is so busy (due to ralphs and other stores) so it takes me longer to park than to walk in and grab my coffee.<//review>

What keeps me from coming back is there is a Iranian man who sits on the corner seat of patio  making inappropriate remarks to women if you don't answe him he gets angry. cannot meet clients here because of this.

Veterans and their spouses are supposed to get free tall coffees today. My husband orders a tall and shows his ID the girl at the counter goes, “no it’s okay” and CHARGES US!! for the coffees! Really. So disrespectful. Can’t tell if that was on purpose or she’s an idiot.< /Text>

The staff is super slow and talk to each other while holding your drinks hostage, only to pass it off when they're done talking. There were 5 employees, it was extremely slow, and they still took forever. The thing I love about Starbucks is they're friendly and fast. This location just didn't do it for me.<//Text>

Open until 11pm most nights, this Starbucks is open long after most others have closed. However, there are a bunch of hard wooden chairs, one comfortable long padded bench, and no armchairs, plus outdoor seating, but most of the indoor seating is occupied almost constantly so finding a place to sit inside is nearly impossible. This Starbucks can be incredibly cold, especially by the window, but the Wi-Fi is excellent and most of the staff is very good.</Text>

This Starbucks is horrible there was 37 people in this tiny area waiting for there drink. The cashier got almost every order wrong or never submitted it. I bought one drink and was there for almost and hour or two, for ONE drink .The employees were really rude I didn't see one smile, they all looked half asleep.< /Review>

Worst Starbucks Customer Service Ever. Marcia has an incredibly bad attitude for no reason at all. I literally walked up, asked for one of my two drink orders, she told me the total for one then walked away. I had to wait for her to come back to finish my order. She rolled her eyes at me, asked for my payment then walked away mumbling under her breath.< /text>

I just moved to La Jolla and have been to this Starbucks the last 2 mornings. My drinks have been wrong both times. I'd rather drive out of the way to another location before I give this place a chance to mess up again.< /Review>

We had a wonderful experience today dinning in. The staff was great, very attentive and polite, great customer service. The food was beyond delicious, the chef is doing an outstanding job. We definitely recommend this place, if in Palm Springs I would suggest you visit. We will be returning soon.</Review>

Best gnocchi my traveled table had ever enjoyed. Can be swallowed without chewing and bits of potato are felt when pressed against the roof of your mouth. Must be tasted.< /Text>

The food is so good and authentic.  Main dishes did take a little time to come out but the server kept us updated and we were fine as we were not in a rush enjoying beautiful weather and catching up with a friend I hadn't seen for a while.  We really enjoyed the bruschetta and my order of their ravioli was really tasty.  We finished off the meal with their chocolate mint cake.  Friendly service.  I will be going back again!<//review><Name>Jim Bullard< /Name><gmap_id>0x80db1ba6f0d582ff:0xa4cd0ad411d38692</gmap_id>< Resp>

Every time I come to Palm Springs, I have to eat here. I’m a chef with a restaurant in Portland, Oregon and rarely eat at the same place twice. This food at this restaurant keeps me coming back. The pasta with sausage is amazing, the homemade gnocchi delicious and the desserts are out of this world. I highly recommend this place for some of the best Italian food you’ll get anywhere!</Text>

<review>Maybe the restaurant was having a bad night. I was unimpressed with the food and service. Not enough beets and too much arugula made the beet salad so so. The meat in the meat ragu was barely discernible and watery. My husband’s medium rare lamb chops were raw. I begged him to send them back but as we had waited quite a while and were hungry, he ate them. The tiramisu was not the best, not even close. The best part of the meal was the coffee. Will not return. Expensive and overrated.</review>< pics>

Wow - this place is the real deal - owned by a Sicilian couple - she's in the kitchen and he's out front hosting.  Charming restaurant with indoor & outdoor seating off the main drag and away from the crowds.  Everything was perfect - the Flanghina wine, the Burrata caprese with roasted and chilled tomatoes that were delicious - only misstep is that we didn't get the amazing warm bread until after the Caprese was taken away - would have loved to wipe the plate clean with it!  I had the Branzino filet piccata, which was perfectly cooked & beyond perfection.  It came with an artichoke, sun dried tomato and spinach salad - lovely side dish.  Husband asked for something fruitti di mare & they made him an incredible spaghetti with white wine garlic sauce and shrimp.  Such a simple dish, but so easy to mess it up - tasted like some of the best we've had on the Amalfi Coast.  Great friendly service.  So happy to find this - we normally travel to Italy once or twice a year for the food, so until we can go back... we've found a wonderful substitute!<//text>

We were looking for a nice Italian restaurant for a birthday dinner and cake across this place. It was highly rated and geographically convenient so we decided to check it out! So glad we did! The starters were great! We had the Bruschetta and the cheesy bread. The lasagna was savory and mild and the sausage penne was creamy and delectable. For a dessert we asked for an affogato which is a scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with espresso. Delicious! Quiet and subtle, this is a gem worth discovering.< /review>

An actual authentic Italian restaurant. I really liked the food, although I would have been happier with a bigger portion. I realize I had only one of what could have been two courses. Our server was diligent and friendly an I feel she earned her tip.</Review>

In Palm Springs for a wedding,  saw the great reviews and decided to give it a try.  Ordered two appetizers and three main courses.  The waitress brought the salad and told up that it wasn't what she had described to us, we told her it was okay.  All 5 dishes were so so in tastes and flavors, nothing too negative, but also nothing too outstanding.  A bit disappointed because we expected it  to be much better.<//review>

Delicious, authentic Itlian food served with a smile from friendly owners! We ordered ahead to pick up take up or a trip to Palm Springs. Gorgeous charcuterie and cheese board for 2!

Incredible authentic Italian and stood up to take-out! We had the garlic bread, insalata di rucola burrata, home-made lasagna ragu, capellini alla puttanesca, and linguine with clams. Everything was delicious, no complaints. This will definitely be our new go to spot when we’re visiting Palm Springs.< /review>

<Text>The food was good. Not the quality I would expect for the prices. Seating was limited, which caused the atmosphere to be somewhat loud. Service was good and the staff was courteous. I would recommend if you don't mind the high prices and want Italian food on the Palm Springs strip. You can get similar food from Olive Garden if you want better prices.< /Text>< Resp>

<review>We have been customers of Il Giardino since they first opened. We love everything about it. Rosario and Theresa are always so lovely and welcoming, we feel like their second family.
And the food. The FOOD! Simply the best, freshest, homemade (everything from scratch) Italian food you will find.
Theresa makes old family recipes and ones that she collects on their annual vacation back to Italy. So the menu is always having new things added.
Oh, and did I mention that Theresa makes the absolute world’s best calamari? She knows just how to cook it down to the second. No breading, just the succulent deliciousness of the calamari with a very light tomato based sauce.</review><date>1579632464071< /date></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Excellent experience. First off the food was incredible. So tasty. Service was super fast and friendly. We were met by the manager and even without a reservation they helped us get a table. Moretti available is always a huge plus.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>We were disappointed in the overall quality of the food given the price.  The Bolognese was a tomato sauce with a few pieces of ground beef…..no velvety richness that you'd expect from a great bolognese.  We also ordered the special, eggplant part.  It was fresh tasting but overall flavors were lack-luster.  Worse yet it was only warm in the center.   We were also surprised that they offered only 2 dishes with fresh homemade pasta.  We'd recommend trying other Italian restaurants in Palm Springs before this one.<//review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Was pleasantly surprised by quality of food. Tasted fresh and homemade. Service was adequate, but only 1 server was working entire floor. Probably the best Italian food I've found in Palm Springs.<//Text>

Nice reliable family owned and cooked food. Sicilian origins. Menu is kept to a manageable size and there are often a surprising number of specials, ask if there is a wine special. I like the fact that they keep the reds cool some places don't get the traditional European room temp or cave temp is around 65 F</Review>

<text>We have easily been to this delightful
Restaurant over a dozen times in the past year and have never had a bad experience.  The food is always fresh, delicious with some unique specials (black spaghetti with clams was an instant hit).  Our first time here was with a friend from NYC who had spent a semester in FLorence who said this was the most authentic Italian meal he had eaten since. The staff and management are friendly, personable and attentive.  This is like going to dinner at the home of old friend's comfortable, satisfying and overall a pleasant experience every time.<//text>< pics>

Lovely Italian restaurant with the option of sitting on the patio, which we did. Bonnie and staff gracefully executed our dinner in a timely manner starting with the Calamari, Ceasar salad and a glass of Chianti.  Followed by Cheese Ravioli en Ragu & Putanesca Angel Hair Pasta. Bonnie recommended the Tiramisu & Panacotta for dessert which we gladly accepted and ate with pleasure on our faces. Thanks to the owner & staff, we will return next time we are in town visiting from Portland Oregon.</review>

<review>Ran by someone who knows what he wants: a fine dining experience. This establishment was fabulous. The food was delicious for all 4 of us in our party. The host while observant to every detail had a calming demeanor. Professional and very proud of his restaurant. I'm vey impressed and suggest this restaurant to anyone. Enjoy a great place to dine run by someone who made a fine dining establishment.<//review>< pics>

Excellent food! My husband and I shared a bottle of wine, the calamari, and the shrimp linguini (which is better than I’ve even had in Italy!); then I had the lamb chops and he had the fish special... excellent service, the bread was sooo good, and the ambiance great.  Best meal we had in Palm Springs, and my friend who visited a month prior said the same! Highly recommend!<//text>

This place offered a great quiet atmosphere with delicious food. For what we’ve tried in the area I thought their flavours were better and consistent unlike some of the other places we’ve eaten at.  Excellent service. Appropriate sized menu.< /Text>

I have been there twice and the food is amazing.  Bottom line is if you want good food, you have to pay a little more.  Perfect portion size and the flavors were great.  I would recommend trying this place and split a salad and an appetizer and order an entree.   I look forward to going back for an another food adventure.<//text>

There are many good restaurants in Palm Springs, but a few stand out as truly exceptional - Il Giardino is among the elite.
Unlike many places, they don't need to try to be special because they understand that great food is about having the best ingredients prepared flawlessly.
Take their calamari appetizer for example. It is not breaded and deep-fried, it is simply prepared with the red sauce but tender, juicy, and flavorful unlike almost any other calamari you will find.
their entrees are likewise delicious and perfectly prepared. I recently had the eggplant Parmesan special and the eggplant was tender and flavorful along with a delicious simple red sauce. This is what Italian food is meant to be.</Text>

<review>Didn't expect to find such an amazing authentic Italian food restaurant in Palm Springs -- but here it is, serving homemade gnocchi and lasagne. This place has such a family feel, we even got to talk to the chef herself after our meal who just wanted to say hi to her guest and check in on our satisfaction. Great inexpensive Italian wine list - would come again< /review>< user_name>

Wasn't that great. I had heard better things when they first opened, but if you basically like breakfast sausage and gravy with mushrooms over pasta, you will love this place. Initially not enough staff. And the prices were a little higher than I expected.</text>

This is a little restaurant with delicious food!  I don't drink so I can't tell you about the wine.  I had the ravioli and tiramisu and both were excellent :)  The service was outstanding.<//Text>

<review>Staff and service were very good, as others have noted. They were very friendly and attentive. We ordered a misto salad to start, which was very good. Unfortunately, the pasta and the entree were mediocre. Pasta was not al-dente, over cooked, and not hot. Salmon was solid but unremarkable. Overall, the food was only ok, and the quality of the ingredients was far lower than the prices of the dishes. If not for the lovely staff this would be a 1 star review.<//review>< username>

<review>Authentic. Great staff, clean and a varied menu. I love Italian food. And this place is "ok". Service is exceptional. Food is middle of the road.
We ordered the chicken pesto (good). Also the capatelli Siciliano (ok).< /review>< rating>

(Translated by Google) Small Italian restaurant, simple interior but with great food for a reasonable price.

(Original)
Klein Italiaans restaurantje, eenvoudige inrichting maar met geweldig lekker eten voor een schappelijke prijs.< /Review>

What an incredible find. Gabby's is known for their Mexican cuisine. Did you know that their Italian dishes are out of this world? We absolutely loved our Italian plates and the service was perfect. 5 Stars for the red sauce dish. We were seated towards the back where it is a little quieter and we felt as if we had VIP service. They offer local wine selections so you can sip and savor your dinner away. Cheers to a great find.<//text>

I got Chile relleno it was about 18$ after tax, I am still so hungry lol the portion was very small! The flavors were just okay... :/ I got take out but service was pleasant and the restaurant itself is very pretty. They also give some chips and salsa and tortillas with your meal. It was just ok for me though considering the insane price for such little food...<//text>

We finally made it in last week for dinner on a slow Thursday night. We had the fish tacos, cheese quessdilla, and the went burrito and we were all very delighted with our food choices. We will definitely come back to sample more of their healthier Mexican food.<//Text>

<Text>We were starving after all that wine tasting. I came here with two other people. I got the chicken enchiladas and they were really good. Their chips and salsa were also good, but you have to pay for them if you want more. The staff was friendly and we were seated right away.<//Text>< Pictures>

The service is fast and very friendly. I asked for a spicier salsa and the chef made it fresh to order. It was fantasti . The standard salsa is quite good as well. My wife had the steak enchilada lunch. The meat was tender and perfectly seasoned. I had camarones diabla and it was very good. We have been here twice and will be back often.<//Text>

The food was delicious!  They serve homemade chips and salsa and we had to ask for more because they were so good.   I had the carne asada taco and the meat had great flavor and was tender.  The green salsa had the right amount of spice and it complimented the taco really well.</review>

The food was amazing and the most attentive service my family got in a while. We ordered Chile relleno, Bryans favorite, La Herradura and a chicken soup. Every one seating on the table described how delicious their plate was.
Highly recommend.<//review>

<text>Stopped in for a bite  before continuing to wine taste. Give from Villa Vallecito recommended Gabby's. We sat at the bar and talked with the husband (Tomas) and while our Chicken Tortilla soup and quesadilla were being made in back. Tomas entertained us and shared stories about Mexico and his wife's cooking experience. Everything is made with Love.

This is a great find that we wouldn't have tried if not for the recommendation. By far one of the best Mexican restaurants we've been to and look forward to coming back in a few months when we return to pick up another wine shipment.</text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Food was delishious, host & hostess were very friendly with excellent service.  We mentioned we were in Murphy to celebrate my birthday.  After dinner they brought me a piece of homemade flan with a candle and played a Happy Birthday song.  I was very surprised and touched by their attentiveness.  Thanks for a wonderful time.<//review>

Excellent food! The only downside to this food was the salsa could be a little more spicy. The ceasar salad doesn't look like much, but the flavor is the best I've ever had. The chicken enchiladas with red sauce was great, and the flan was amazing...which is saying a lot coming from someone who doesn't like flan.<//review>

Amazing food! Great chips & salsa. Growing up in the Bay Area authentic Mexican is a must for me. Definitely nothing else like Gabby's in this area. We ordered the Supreme Nachos (carnitas) they were delicious! Especially in this area you can't beat the price! Quality food and friendly staff! Much recommended!< /Review>

I was born and raised in San Diego and was fortunate to always have amazing Mexican food there. It’s hard for me to find Mexican restaurants that I feel serve truly authentic and flavorful Mexican food and I rarely write reviews for restaurants. Gabby’s Cuisine is absolutely delicious and authentic. I highly recommend the Pascal Hidalguense dish. The molé was incredible! Jimena, our waitress, was so kind and professional. We were thoroughly impressed with the food and service. All seven of us in our party loved our meals and want to return again.< /text>

< Review>
Nutrishop riverside has by far been the most helpful whole being on this healthy journey! I started going to them in February and have had nothing but great service. Everyone is always so nice and welcoming. They are always willing to help or answer questions! My favorite is the fact that you can sample supplements before you buy. They offer an inbody scan and review with you and give you tips on what to change to reach your goals. They are my go to for healthy snacks. The quest chips and the eat me guilt free brownies are my favorite. They regularly have specials and when you buy supplements you accumulate points. By far the best nutrition shop I've been to!<//Review>

I love going to this Nutrishop specifically because the employees are always SO helpful. Whenever I have a question, they always have the answer and I have never felt like they were trying to push their products on me like at other businesses. They always have a lot of items in stocks and have provided me with some really great recommendations. Plus, I can get free InBody scans to track my progress and that helps motivate me so much. So big props to the team at Nutrishop in Riverside!</review>

I've been coming to Nutrishop for a couple years now and will continue to shop here for years to come. The whole staff is super friendly and informative. Cameron really goes the extra mile to help me with any questions, samples and always remembers me when I go there. They really make me feel like an important customer and love that they also have a great selection of supplements with great prices as well. You won't be disappointed!</text>

<review>Not gonna lie, first time I went there I received such good energy! I got pre workout and the staff was super cool and friendly. Then fast forward they explained me the rules of the competition and I decided to do the weigh in as well as the inbody which explained a lot of things I didn’t know before! I have been going to this nutrishop many times for the past 2 years and even won a past giveaway. Just go in and ask and they’ll be happy to help u for sure!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<text>I always feel welcomed when coming into the store. Never has any of the workers pressures me into buying anything. Sometimes I've walked in just for questions and to be educated, and purchased nothing but the employees never made me feel uncomfortable for not buying anything. I've been going there for a few years now and all the employees know my husband and I by name as well as our kids. Nutrishop has helped me along my weight loss journey (losing 100 lbs) after having kids and now with my muscle gain. 💪 I couldn't have done it without them. ❤😊</text><Gmap_id>0x80dcb74c8ab79133:0xd4f0acf0e2097153<//Gmap_id><Rating>5<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

I LOVE Nutrishop Riverside, Cameron & Gisselle are always extremely helpful in catering to my specific needs. They are well-versed in explaining the body analysis and always have great recommendations. Cameron recommended a Superfoods Supplement to me and I’ve never looked back. They offer samples to try different supplements to see what best fits for every customer. They are quick to offer help and create a welcoming and accepting environment inside the store. I could not recommend NutriShop Riverside enough for anyone who is looking to take back their health!<//review>

This place is amazing! Not only is the staff friendly and helpful but they also motivate you to get healthier through excersise and nutrition! They have challenges as incentives.  Great products and deals! I weighed myself on their wonderful  scale and even though I wasn't so happy with the results I left motivated and ready to try again thanks to Connor who helped me by suggesting some tips and products, such as fat burners, protein, collagen, energy, etc...Godspeed everyone!< /Review>

Came in today to just take a look, walked out with a few items we were very happy with. We were assisted by an associate named Breona who was very very nice and informative to us. It got pretty busy and she was able to get in contact with everyone in the store without having everyone wait a very long time. Her hospitality was amazing and I’m very happy we came in today. Thankyou Breona !!<//text>

Love this place. Was looking for a new Nutrishop after moving back home from the Marines and they’ve sure made me feel like family. Always welcomed by a smile by the manager wade and always keeping me updated with the newest supplement. Jaimie and Ashley behind the counter are great with helping me out then Cameron is always there to remind to keep your goals going after a long day of negativity💪🏽< /Review>

Friendly and knowledgeable staff who are more than willing to work with you and your needs. I came in with a few questions and had a few more as others were answered and they stuck with me through all of them. This Nutrishop was 10x better than the 3 in my area, I will definitely be returning.<//review>

Love the costumer service at Nutrishop Riverside.  I feel they give their honest opinion on products, by not just pushing things on you that you may not need.  Secondly they are very knowledgeable about the body and how it works.  I appreciate that they do the free body analysis to help guide me.  Check them out!<//Text>

If you're looking for a great assortment of protien snacks (i.e. bars, cookies, chips, jerky, cake bites), then you're in luck!! This location has the best selection of flavors I have ever found in ONE place! Not to mention, they sell Bang energy drinks at the most competitive price in the area, hands down! Great staff that are friendly, energetic, and most importantly. . . knowledgeable! They also have some great shirts, hats, and shaker cups. Check em out!< /Text>

One doesn’t go without the other and at NS Riverside they understand that. Go there with a goal in mind and allow them to help you shape it, then setup the process to get you where you want to be. Always use their inbody and most definitely get a meal plan. Find out what supplements work for the process of reaching your goals, not just fad products that come and go or are heavily pushed on IG before disappearing from the market. Their staff will help you take the steps needed to be successful; actually successful guys, not momentarily satisfied before rebounding.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Since the change in management there's been aggressive sales tactics. They try upselling me stuff I don't want or don't want the 'special' I'll start spending my $200+ at a different nutrishop every other month and that's not to include the stuff I buy that's a 30 day supply. Buyer beware.</review>

<text>Best nutrition store in Riverside. The staff and management are highly knowledgeable and have degrees from accredit Universities (Wade from UCR, Cameron from CSUN in Kinesiology). They aren’t trying to push or up sell customers because they are recommending products that are scientifically proven to promote recovery and protein synthesis followed with the correct diet.  They tend to start everyone off by recommending BCAA and Glutamine because those aid in recovery which is important for any individual no matter there goal. I happen to be accredited a B.S. in biochemistry from UC Riverside so I think I know a thing or two behind the chemistry of the body and how certain products help aid recovery.  To customers that tend to review google before stopping in to a nutrition store. I highly recommending giving this store a chance. Unfortunately there are petty businesses  in Riverside that strive to try and put down this shop because they are incomparable in many aspects and care more about the amount of cash going out their door rather than the customer service and relationships that Nutrishop Riverside strives to create with its clients.</text>< user_name>

Found this gem of a place during my first visit to San Diego. The Classic ramen was literally the best thing I've ever tasted at a vegan restaurant. So many flavors! We had some rolls that were delicious as well. Definitely going again the next time I'm in town!</review>

<UserId.>105020362419629730757</UserId.><Review>Okay I'm shocked this doesn't have AT LEAST a 4.7 so I had to leave a review. It should be closer to 4.9- Absolutely the best vegan sushi I have ever had!! I've tried a whole handful of vegan sushi spots including Now Sushi in Mission Bay and Kensho in OC. The Yasai is super creative in their usage of veggies and fungi rather than relying heavily on imitation seafood and that is what sets it apart. The prices are reasonable for what it is, the decor and ambiance is wonderful, and the service was EXCELLENT. Go asap!!!! (I was too excited to eat the subsequent rolls I ordered so this was the only one that got photographed.)< /Review></record>

<review>The food is fabulous. The sushi is incredible. So I’ve said food is spot on now let’s get to their new policy.  The GIANT flaw I  encountered (this is new) is when you call to make a reservation (for 3 people for a Tuesday night) they want your credit card information so they can charge me some mystery fee if you are a no show.  Again this reservation was for 3 people for a Tuesday night not 10 people on a Saturday and the person on the phone had no idea what would be charged to my card.  Are you kidding me...?  what a first impression to give to potential customers.  I’d rethink this policy management.  I declined and booked a table at a different vegan restaurant.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>Great food but terrible customer service. Their poor customer service seems to be a common theme upon their poor reviews.
Everything we ate was great and I would highly recommend the brussel sprouts. The reason I did not rate this restaurant higher was due to issues with the manager.
The night we went the restaurant was busy and the service was pretty slow, which was understandable,  but what really bothered us was the unprofessional way they handled forgetting one of our orders. After waiting a while for our food and then finishing our meal, the waitress brought our check and I pointed out that we never got one of our orders which was fine, we just wanted it reduced from our bill. At this time our meal was over and it was time for us to move on with our night. She was understanding and removed it but then 3 minutes later as we were about to leave, she told us that the manager is requiring us to pay for the roll and will bring it to us. We would have gladly taken the roll earlier but at this time we were done with dinner and expressed our feelings that since this was not brought to us at the appropriate time we no longer wanted the roll.
This is a common mistake that happens with restaurants but not once has a  restaurant required us to pay for the meal after we already finished our time there and paid our bill.  After asking to speak to the manager, the waitress informed us that the manager would not come out to talk to us.  We were then guilted into paying for the roll as the waitress appeared very concerned about getting in trouble if we did not take it.

This restaurant would be great but needs a new manager!
I would have came back here again if it weren't for the issues with the manager which appears to happen frequently as stated in other reviews.<//Text><resp>None< /resp><time>1622518745164</time>< UserId.>

That should have been my first red flag. I go there the people were kind but I waited an hour and a half for sushi and soup. I asked for the soup to not be spicy and it was spicy anyways. The food did not taste well at all. I go to sign for my payment and I'm given a broken pen and the ink got all over my hand. Its definitely not the hype. Sipz Clairemont is definitely the place to go for Vegan sushi or Asian food.<//Review>< pics>

The gentleman who took my reservation asked if I wanted to sit inside or outside. I said inside and when I arrived early for my reservation they said I would be sitting at the bar. It was a special occasion so I did not want to be sitting side by side because it would be hard to conversate. I spoke with the front end manager, who was a short hispanic woman, and she was very rude. She did not apologize or try to accommodate. In fact, she argued with me. There was a table outside that was empty for over a half hour but she said she couldn't put us there because we requested to sit inside. I then asked for upper management's phone number. I called him three times and each time it went straight to voicemail. His voicemail was full so I was not able to leave a formal complaint. I was trying to avoid writing this but since they did not answer the phone, I decided this was the best way for them to address the issue.<//Text><Name>noelle sanchez<//Name>< Resp>

Some of them came with tofu/mushrooms while others had “no shrimp” or “no crab” and they wouldn’t tell us exactly what was in it. It definitely had the same texture as the real thing!

Our first time at Yasai was nothing but magical!! Ambiance, lovely staff, super amazing Chef and delicious food!
We had pretzel slider, two rolls and ramen - more than enough to share between two people. As vegan person I couldn't be more happy with the menu but I am sure that everyone can find this place a true piece of heaven.
So much love put into this place 💕
Will be back for sure🤗</text>

My husband and I went for the soft opening at their new location in little Italy San Diego and we loved the food as always! Will definitely recommend to all vegan and vegetarian lovers...their appetizers, ramen and different sushi rolls are all amazing...

Great ambience and have a separate sushi bar where people can see while sushi is in making...a bit expensive but all their food items are very tasty!<//Review>

I had the worst dining experience in my life tonight due to an extremely defensive and rude hostess.  I made it a point of mine to regularly order takeout and patronize the Yasai to do my part to support local business, especially plant-based restaurants, which are going through a rough time during COVID. I even celebrated my 37th birthday here in November and my waiter was nice enough to store my birthday cake in their refrigerator. In all, I would estimate that I've patronized this restaurant roughly 20+ times. However, today was unlike any other time that I tried to order food. My date and I arrived at 6:30 PM at the Yasai on India Street and asked for a table for 2. For instance, the inside of the restaurant was full, which is a violation of COVID restrictions. Nevertheless, the outside only had one table occupied with the other 6 or so others open. The hostess said, "We don't have any seating available." I then asked how many reservations were booked and whether there was an opening soon. The hostess said, "We have an opening at 7:30." I then asked, "It's 6:30 now. Did anyone no show because there's seven seats available based on the tables." She said, "We can't be congested due to COVID." I then said, "Aren't the tables outside already socially distanced?" Then my date said, "We'll take the 7:30 time slot." The hostess then said, "Actually, we have the right to deny service. You can eat elsewhere. Have a good night!" I then asked if I could speak to the manager. Then she walked away. She comes back about 2 mins later and says, "My manager is unavailable." I said I'll wait. She then leaves again to go to the kitchen in the back of the restaurant where I can see her talking to a chef in a white hat. The hostess then returns to us in the front and says, "My manager said I'm the supervisor." I then said, "So now you're the manager or are you the supervisor? How do you supervise yourself? My date then asks her what her name is. The hostess says, "I don't have to tell you my name." Then walks away yet again! At this point it was apparent to me that the staff here provided no information to the public nor was there any visible food licensing permits, legible COVID reopen plan, or business permits. In short, there is no point of contact name or contact information displayed for patrons to even report complaints such as this, so the hostess refusing to even provide her name and her failure to bring a manager to hear my concerns is apparently business as usual. Therefore, I will never spend another dime here and encourage you to do the same.</Text>

<Review>I was catching a flight and took my friend here as thank you for the ride. I had no idea it was Vegan and almost left but I am happy I didn't. We both enjoyed the differant rolls alot. Atmosphere was nice and clean and food came out fast and very beautiful. I love actually sushi with fish but I would recommend giving this a try, it felt healthy and light. We had the California, shrimp tempura and crunch roll with edamame. They serve regular and purple rice, we opted for purple. There are a lot of other options on their menu as far as grill and curry i believe but from what we had, we both enjoyed it and were happy we stayed to give it a try.</Review><Response>None< /Response>< Time>

<username>Ivon Martin< /username><Time>1598848398575<//Time><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I was excited to try this place and went there with my wife and mother. My mother ordered a ramen, while my wife and I ordered 3 rolls to share. My mother's ramen came out in about 5 minutes, and was pretty good...all down hill from there. We proceeded to sit in the near empty restaurant for over an hour for our rolls to arrive, even though we were at one point the only ones in the restaurant.

When we asked our server about the long wait we were told that there were many to go orders to be made and only one person making rolls, and that we had to wait for the to go orders because they were concerned about not meeting the to go delivery deadlines. When we asked about "but what about the people that are actually at your restaurant?" we were met with a shrug and told to wait another 15 minutes.

About 25 minutes after that, when my mom went in to ask what was going on, she was rudely told she needed to be patient and that this "isn't fast food"

Such high hopes for this fun menu, but unfortunately the lack of understanding in how to do table service, combined with the rude dismissal of our concerns will keep us from ever going back or suggesting it to anybody.</Text>< pictures>

<review>Worst service ever. The woman who works there, she is so rude. When we asked her about the service, she said “this isn’t McDonald’s. It’s not fast food.” DO NOT go here unless you want mediocre food and to be treated horribly.<//review>< Pics>

For weeks I was so excited to go there, because of the menu, and the idea that the restaurant represents. Unfortunately it wasn't a pleasant experience...The service was so bad, that I couldn't really enjoy the food.  After an hour wait for a few rolls, and trying to figure out why my food wasn't coming out, I was met with only a rude response when expressing my concerns.

I won't be going back, and what makes it more disappointing is that I won't be bringing my vegan brother or friends, who I was so excited to show this spot.</review>

Phenomenal food, healthy and delicious! I'm also impressed with the value for such high quality. $15 buys a nice portion of ramen and a roll.<//Review>

<Review>Special occasion? I would definitely recommend here! 10000000%!

My partner and I celebrated our anniversary today at the Yasai and had the most amazing experience. We just had to share how good it was! First of all, when we called to make a reservation, the server asked if it was a special occasion, so we told her what we were celebrating. When we got there, we were seated immediately and greeted by the friendliest server. At our table, they had laid out vegan treats compliments of our day!! I was so blown away. But it didn't stop there. 🤚 We began with a lil bowl of free edamame, also. They have beer, wine, and sake to choose from in terms of alcohol. For food, they have a wide selection of Japanese cuisine: gyoza, ramen, karaage, sushi, and more! Every dish had a large, amazing flavor palette; they even had sushi with impossible meat in it! My personal favorite was the karaage appetizer. The presentation of each dish was so so pretty as well. If you go for a special occasion, they may even have flowers for you. At the end of our meal, the server presented us with two free wraps, compliments of the chef. 👩🏻‍🍳 It felt like the perfect end to our special day, and I would recommend this place to anyone.< /Review>< Rating>

<text>Horrible! It was one of the worse experience I have had in a restaurant. We sat waiting for our dinner for over one hour..and when I asked the waiter, than later the manager how come we didn't have our sushi-dinner served  over one hour in an empty restaurant... I was treated with condescension and the answer was- " You have to wait with patience because we have other orders in front of you, and we have only one chef."   I said - but the restaurant is empty.
He said they had take out orders..  he also said with annoyance to me, The Client -  "You are in a restaurant, this is not a fast food place!".
Wow. Horrible service, real bad, by the staff, and the management. A shame.
I will never go back there.  Terrible experience. They made us wait for over one hour for sushi in an empty restaurant, while they served the  take-out dinners first.. and they still treated us bad for asking to be served properly.
I don't recommend it at all.  Unbelievable!< /text><Rate>1<//Rate><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

<Text>Rinse picked it up and had it back quickly. It was perfectly organized and packaged. The representative was professional and friendly. We were not able to be home for the return and they made sure that the bag was delivered and took a picture to ensure that we knew when it had arrived.
It's great.
I highly recommend Today Cleaners.<//Text>< time>

Staff were professional.  When I came in to pick up my shirts and they weren't folded as I'd asked, the staff immediately took care of it for me. My issue with this cleaners is they are just too rough on clothes.  As soon as I started having my shirts done here the buttons started breaking in two on my shirts.  It happened numerous times so I know it's the way they launder shirts.  Dry cleaning was the same.  Too rough and too hot when cleaning my suits.</text>

<Review>I can't remember her name, but she works at the Panama Lane location in the morning. I'm new to the area and didn't know Today Cleaners had a location on that side of town. I'm used to using the White Lane location. AND I AM SO GLAD I DID. She is always courteous,  smiling, helpful and her musical selection is PERFECT. Makes my morning go even better after sharing a shirt moment with a person with such a positive aura. You have a GREAT one there, Today Cleaners. Hold onto her. And give her a raise.<//Review></record>

My first time seeing her there at the Panama and Wible rd. Location in Bakersfield Ca. But she left a great impression  on me as far i want to be treated while conducting business.  Great job on hiring her, she was excellent.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Took my daughter's dress in to be pressed only. The young lady Lindsey was very courteous and professional. A little after two o'clock I received both text and email that my order was ready for pick-up sooner than expected. My daughter went into the location to pick up her dress and the same young lady that helped me that morning, helped my daughter. Lindsey had remembered what I told her my daughter dress was needed for and wished her good luck. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE :). Looking forward to during continuous business with this location.</review>< Pictures>

I came at 4pm and they said I needed to return because they had to run my dress thru again . I would rather someone be truthful with me and come back with my garment clean as to take it home and have spots. So I did appreciate the honesty . Didn't really like coming back but understood.

<Review>They went over and above. My father passed away and I had forgotten to pick up the suit we wanted him to wear for the funeral before they closed for the weekend. We had a deadline to keep with the funeral home. They were responsive to my messages for help and arranged a time for me to pickup the suit outside of their normal hours. Thank you soon much, Today Cleaners!!!</Review>< pics>

Just moved to town and was in need of dry cleaning services. Went to Today Cleaners on Panama near Wible and was amazed at the quick turnaround time. The staff is incredibly friendly. I am impressed, and will definitely be going back. Highly recommended.<//review>

<review>CAUTION!!!!  I WENT IN TO PICK UP MY CLOTHES WHICH WAS 12 PIECES OF CLOTHING WITH A VALUE OF ABOUT $600 ONE DAY AND WAS TOLD THAT IT HAD ALREADY BEEN PICKED UP. SO MY CLOTHES WAS GIVEN AWAY TO SOMEONE ELSE AND THE MANAGER/OWNER SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THAT COULD BE DONE ABOUT IT. THEY DONT EVEN ASK FOR ID SO ANYONE CAN LITERALLY WALK IN GIVE YOUR PHONE # AND TAKE YOUR CLOTHES. THEY ARE SO UNPROFESSIONAL. RUDE STAFF. I WILL NEVER BE GOING TO THIS PLACE AGAIN.< /review>< Pics>

<text>I came here as a party of 12 (big family) and was seated within 30 minutes despite the dinner rush (6 pm on a Saturday). We were greeted with chips and salsa at the table, which carried a hint of spice, but was still enjoyable for the kids. I ordered the Cadillac Margarita, and my wife had the Anta's Spicy Margarita, both of which were quite enjoyable (the spicy margarita certainly lives up to it's name). I had the Fajitas, and with choices of chicken, New York Steak, or grilled shrimp (you can mix for a fee) I opted for a mix of steak and shrimp. The food, drinks, and staff were all exceptional. What truly made this place stand out to me was the diversity of selection. Going out to enjoy a meal as a parent can sometimes be a challenge as children are about as opinionated and vocal about their choice of food as Gordon Ramsey, so the addition of chicken nuggets to the menu makes for a slightly less stressful experience for multi-age families.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOi9PRHYirc2dVMpfHBbUOGhGqr11ka78E3koqO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

Always a pleasure to dine in at Anita's.  The Blue Coast Shrimp (Bacon Wrapped Shrimp) are superb. The red salsa is always a winner.</review>

<Time>1620575745817< /Time><rate>1< /rate><Text>Called ahead was told 20 minute wait. Upon arrival there were groups in line waiting for the hostess to return. Upon returning the hostess stated there would be no more names taken and no one else seated for the night. It was 7:45pm on a Saturday.

The hostess was friendly and it was more than likely a management decision. It’s an interesting tactic to turn paying customers away over an hour before closing.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80dc6e3bac04bce5:0xdc3260843b833484</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

If you wish to taste canned food this is the place for you. Nothing tasted fresh.  I found the sauces to be too salty. Unfortunately the service was also disappointing. Manager confessed some of the items are purchased from outside. I found the mom and pop spots in oceanside to have better food. Was excited to try this place. Save your money and go  elsewhere.< /review>

Unlike most restaurants who have outdoor parking lot tented dinning , Anita's has a real outdoor covered patio with tiled floors and heater lamps. My friend and I celebrated her birthday with frozen margaritas during happy hour. Afterwards we warmed up with chicken tortilla soup for me and albondigas (meatball) soup for the birthday girl. There are 3 sizes to choose from; a cup, small bowl or large bowl, and we both went with the small bowl. It was perfect for a light but filling dinner, not to mention delicious! Our server was quick and very friendly.  I'll definitely be going back.< /Review>< Pictures>

Called ahead for a party of 6 for our best friends who just got engaged an hour before, was told they don't save tables ahead of time and that our whole party needed to be there. Arrived an hour before close and checked in and they informed us that the open table they had was reserved for a party not there yet. So ridiculous and contradictory!</review>

This is absolutely out fav Mexican restaurant and go often. But we were disappointed that our taquitos were over cooked and burnt inside. No Bueno! If we had eaten there we would have sent them back and gotten a fresh batch but we ordered take out due to Covid. Our chicken tacos were amazing as usual.</Text>

< Review>
The building and the service are awesome. I really like the open space of the building is really nice. We only tried the ceviche and the Ponchos special burrito. The ceviche was good. The burrito could use a little more flavor.
We ordered the house margarita. It was not good. It was very hard to drink. Needs a lot of work.
If I lived up here, I would come and try some new stuff.< /Review>

A 15 minute wait for a table slowly turns into 55 minutes. You're not allowed to order drinks unless you're seated or ordering takeout, NOT while waiting to dine in.
Their website does not accurately describe the prices or happy hours at this location. Happy hour ends at 6pm, rather than 7pm like the website says. None of the staff seems to be on the same page when it comes to policy. Someone that seemed to be a manager but never identified himself was kind enough to give us 1 round of happy hour drinks since we had been waiting before 6.
Food was decent, nothing special.<//review>

Excellent Mexican food restaurant. Food was amazing as well as the margaritas 🍹.  Server was very friendly and attentive. Only complaint I would have is that the waiting time to be seated is a little too long. But if you don't mind waiting you'll definitely enjoy your visit.</Review>

I recommend this restaurant to everyone. It was the best Chili Relleno I've ever had. My friends loved there tacos and burritos. The service was great.  The wait time was 30 minutes and that's not bad these days, will definitely go back< /Text>

Just moved into the area and checking out the local eats. Anita's was recommended to us. We loved the look and feel of the place as soon as we walked in. The decor' is really inviting and sets off a great vibe for a fun dining experience. We ordered large margaritas from the bar until our table was ready. We liked the drinks, but found the almost 14.00 drinks a bit much in price. Our bar tab was almost as much as our meals. Our server and bartender were pleasant. Our 4 dinners were all very good (Carnitas, grilled fish, chicken enchiladas and grilled shrimp), but served with traditional sides - beans and rice. The cost for the meals was a bit high considering the sides in my opinion. Overall, it was a good evening. We sat on the patio. It was a bit loud, but comfortable on a summer night.<//text>

Ordered Grubhub and it was great.  Going there almost every thing from the Margaritas to the stake was tasteless.  Service was decent.</text>

I had a delicious meal to satisfy my Mexican food habit :) I had the sour cream enchiladas. The little one requested a bean and cheese burrito to take home for later, but ended up eating half of it there! My sister had the taquitos. The waiter was very kind and the service was fast. The pico de gallo was superb, but you need to request it as it does not come with the chips and salsa. Overall great food and would love to come again!</text>

Anitas is O.G. My parents would go when it was at the old location before I was born. I've been coming to Anita's since a baby as my brothers and sisters and the tradition continues while we bring our children following to the new location. BTW I've been ordering the same thing for the past 30 years... those Beef Rolled Tacos with Guacamole Rice and Beans.. thanks for the memories..</review>

The portions are big, so sharing is a good way to go. The enchiladas are to die for. Now it is not Tex Mex (I lived in Texas for years), but it is real close!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

The cocktails are very good. The chips and salsa are great. Reasonably priced for the the amount of food you get. My only complaint would be that the beef in the enchiladas was overly shreaded almost to a paste. It would have been nice to have more of a traditional shreaded beef. The beef flavor was very good as well as the enchilada sauce. Also get the churros for dessert so worth it.< /text>

<Text>My sister and I had plans to go have breakfast at a place right by Anita's before my train.  Unfortunately we ran into a full parking lot and a wait.  So, we decided on Anita's instead.  What a nice breezy, beautiful, restaurant.  I loved the high ceilings, lighting and interior.  The food was excellent.  We both loved the rice which I typically ignore completed in Mexican food.  It was fluffy and delicious.  I had to stop myself from eating all of the rice and beans.  I believe it was only 12.95 for a 3 item combo of tamale, taco, and enchilada.  We both really enjoyed our food.</Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Really enjoy the scene here, though it gets pretty busy during the weekend! The cooks here are really amazing at what they do and the waiters are fabulous! Our waiter was on top of it! Along with the man serving our food. Delicious food. Great service. And a nice space. The only downfall is because there are so many people who enjoy this place, weekend wait times can stretch and there isn't too much seating for hungry customers. And their to-go options are pretty limited. Like, really limited. But all in all, good place to enjoy yummy Mexican food!< /Review>

I hope we can keep passing down that tradition. I love Anita's delicious food and will always come here as long as I live in California. The new location is beautiful! It's bittersweet that they moved because of all the memories I had going to the old location as a kid but I still love them and there food and most of the wait staff stayed the same. Anita's is absolutely my favorite Mexican food restaurant. They also make delicious (and strong) margaritas and there beans are from another world!</text>< user>

<text>I love Anita's restaurant. I'm a retired Marine. When I was stationed at Camp Pendleton this was one of my favorite places to eat when I had weekend liberty. The food is awesome and in large portions. I am retired now and still go there. What does that say? Go! Don't miss out. The old original restraint closed and moved down the street and offer a better environment. The food is still the same and good.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Came down to California with a friend for a vacation and had never been down here. Had the chance of meeting the owners to Anita’s at another restaurant in Carlsbad, so had to check It out ! Some of the best Mexican food and margaritas I’ve had. We were not disappointed. So thank you, will visit again if I’m ever down here in the future.< /Text>

An Old Town Oceanside mexican food restaurant that turned Gastropub!  It's the same terrific staff and recipes with a new style of restaurant.  You'll love the place! Full open bar, really nice outdoor seating, small and large indoor tables, and oversized booths that seat 6 comfortably. This is an excellent dining experience in the heart of the Coast Highway through Oceanside.< /Text>

<review>You want authentic Mexican food and drinks... this is a must have. Locals know that Anita's is a family restaurant with a couple locations. What you need to know is everything is different from one to the next.

Each Anita's is unique as a tortilla.

My wife and I split the Fajitas and it's plenty for 2. Good portions and fair prices and great service.</review><Gmap_id>0x80dc6e3bac04bce5:0xdc3260843b833484</Gmap_id>< user_name>

Asked busboy for silverware and he brought me a single fork. Nothing else and it seemed like it was beneath him. When he came back in about 5 minutes I asked him for napkins and a spoon. He brought napkins. Still beneath him.
Let it go...
I started to dive into the dish, which was a good portion. Totally disappointed! Worst Fajita meat ever! (Beef) absolutely no flavor. Cooked meat straight from the freezer. Lots of onions, very little bell peppers of either color. I dont know about the rest of the menu, but Fajitas are normally the flagship of a restaurant.
Never going back.<//Review><time>1565548506051</time><gmap_id>0x80dc6e3bac04bce5:0xdc3260843b833484</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Best sit down Mexican fair in O'Side.  Food is always good and the new location is beautiful.  The only reason it's not 5 star is because of the lack of any parking.  Hauling a bunch of kids here can be difficult on the standard busy days, Friday, Sat, Sun.< /review>< Name>

Good Cadillac margaritas, a bit pricey at $15 each considering my dinner was $12.  That was for the large, but regular was still $13, so we upsized figuring 1 would be enough, which it was.

Great Mexican restaurant. Has a standard selection of beers. With regards to the food- the portions are huge and the prices fair. Also, some of the waitresses and hostesses are very nice. Great place to eat with friends and family.</review>

I love their new location. They have done a great job with the decor and maintaining the charm of the building, which I believe was built in the 20's. The food and service were great. Good lunch specials.</Review>

They have GREAT Margaritas and drinks! Good date night. Food service and staff is awesome. You get your food quickly and staff is on it! I feel like they need to spice up the food, not enough flavor for me.  Chips and salsa are great. It just doesn't hit the spot with me, wish their food was more spicy...average.<//Text>

What a gorgeous place to go! The high vaulted ceilings, the tables are just so beautiful, the wide open room and its so very clean! The food is still so delicious and my favorite thing to eat are the beans! The move was a great choice! I love Anitas so much!< /text>

<Review>Chips and salsa where good.
Unfortunately from what we remember from old location. Today's food was bland,  beans needed salt, beef and chicken,enchiladas needed salt.
Had to ask for forks so we could eat our food, yikes!!! Waiter sucked big time. Gave me bill and called me by another name.
Other then that ,new place looks great!!!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80dc6e3bac04bce5:0xdc3260843b833484<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Anita's has finally moved to their beautiful new location.  This is a local favorite and a place we visit frequently.   Very pleased with the new location even though it is further from home in South Oceanside and area that is growing by leaps and bounds with wonderful new restaurants, small shops and coffee houses.   I love this place so I will give them a little more time to work out the rough edges.   They are struggling a little with trying to get help, the kitchen staff needs to stabilize.  Working out the kinks is difficult even for a place that has been in business for years.  Turnover in the restaurant business is a big problem currently from fast food all the way up the food chain.   A few friends have complained that they increased prices but $10.95 is still a bargain for a large plate of sour cream chicken enchiladas, beans, rice, tortilla's and salsa, my favorite.  With the expense of relocating a small price increase is certainly understandable.  Wait staff is great and apologetic.  We love you, Anita's and we will keep coming back until you are back to your five star rating.  We love to support local, family owned businesses. Be sure to have a margarita!!< /Text><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

Terribly noisy. When restaurant is very busy, couples don't get seated until groups of 3 or more get seated.  An open table that seats 4 would stay open until 3 or more people arrived.  Outside seating not very inviting. Food was good, but I would only return when the restaurant is not busy.</text>

Enjoyable atmosphere, but nothing real Mexican in the food. We ordered fajitas, with steak  and shrimps, meat was tasteless and dry and chewy, shrimp were over cooked, so it was dry too. It needs more seasoning and sauce.  My husband ordered tacos, and he said same thing. If it was not because of the fried beans, it will be worse. Thank goodness, Margaritas was good.< /Text>

Terribly noisy. When restaurant is very busy, couples don't get seated until groups of 3 or more get seated.  An open table that seats 4 would stay open until 3 or more people arrived.  Outside seating not very inviting. Food was good, but I would only return when the restaurant is not busy.</text>

Great find on PCH in Oceanside.  Stopped in for a quick bite and was pleasantly surprised with the food and how quick it was served.</Review>

<Review>Enjoyable atmosphere, but nothing real Mexican in the food. We ordered fajitas, with steak  and shrimps, meat was tasteless and dry and chewy, shrimp were over cooked, so it was dry too. It needs more seasoning and sauce.  My husband ordered tacos, and he said same thing. If it was not because of the fried beans, it will be worse. Thank goodness, Margaritas was good.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<Text>My first time checking out their new location. I think the Mexican food was a little more authentic at the old spot. But I’m still going to give them 5 starts because our bartender killed it. His name was Mateo. He busted his butt. Not just for us. I’ll come back because of him.<//Text>< Date>

Mmmmm. What's not to love?! Truly authentic Mexican food that is extremely delicious. Best homemade salsa AND chips served complementary. Great service and amazing food! All at extremely fair prices. I definitely recommend Anita's to everyone!< /Text>

Atmosphere is nice. People are nice and the food is good. Price is fair. Only issue were the few flys. I didnt eat the free chips cuz there were several flys bouncing around on them. Get rid of the flys! Get a 5</review>

Hosted a party of 30 at this location.  Excellent food and excellent customer service.  Took the Amtrak train from LA to Oceanside.   This location is about 3 blocks away.  Highly recommended for great food and drinks.  You will not regret it!<//Review>

Funny how people complain about parking. Behind the restaurant has atleast 25 spots. Not many restaurants Downtown Oceanside or Coast Highway have parking at all.  ✌<//Review>

First time I ate at the new location.  Not that great.  We were told 35 min wait time and it was actually 1hr and 20 min.  I ordered the chimichanga which is suppose to be deep fried but if it was it wasn’t for very long it wasn’t crispy.  I stayed no guacamole three times to waitress and still got a big scoop of it on my plate.  Not very satisfied.  My wife, son and I have been to Anita’s since we lived in the area while I was stationed on Camp Pendleton.  We would take family weekends to come over to Oside on weekends from Yuma.  There were several open tables but they would seat 3-4 so they say empty.  Several times while we were waiting groups of 3 and 4 would get seated immediately.  Like I said not very satisfied but hey there always Colima’s which has never changed and still tastes GREAT.</text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>Just ate and had an uncomfortable experience at Anita's Restaurant. Placed our order and received our food without an incident. When we received our bill the itemized receipt reflected correctly at $38.59 but the receipt that they wanted me to sign reflected a subtotal of $52.61. Asked our server Isaac S to explain the difference and he told us that he realized his mistake and will ask the manager to fix it. The manager came over and still wanted me to sign the $52.61 receipt but said he'd only process the $38.59 amount. I denied this of course and we finally agreed on him cancelling the order and ringing it up again but he then came back and said that he couldn't do this either and that our server didn't care about his tip and he closed our bill at the $38.59 amount. After leaving the restaurant I looked at my online banking to see the pending $52.61 charge so I called my bank to see if there was a pending charge for the $38.59 and the $52.61 charge would drop off? Was told no, long story short I disputed the charge and want everyone to check their receipts when they visit this restaurant!!< /Text>< pics>

I have never heard of sour cream enchiladas I though I would try the shrimp. It was delicious. The salsa and chips are wonderful. The beans are not canned. You can taste just a bit of baking powder, the
old way. I will go home and try to make the enchiladas. They are ausom.</text>

<Rating>2</Rating><Text>First time I ate at the new location.  Not that great.  We were told 35 min wait time and it was actually 1hr and 20 min.  I ordered the chimichanga which is suppose to be deep fried but if it was it wasn’t for very long it wasn’t crispy.  I stayed no guacamole three times to waitress and still got a big scoop of it on my plate.  Not very satisfied.  My wife, son and I have been to Anita’s since we lived in the area while I was stationed on Camp Pendleton.  We would take family weekends to come over to Oside on weekends from Yuma.  There were several open tables but they would seat 3-4 so they say empty.  Several times while we were waiting groups of 3 and 4 would get seated immediately.  Like I said not very satisfied but hey there always Colima’s which has never changed and still tastes GREAT.</Text>< Pictures>

Nothing worse than being ignored after being seated. Food was average. Had to ask twice for more chips and felt lucky to get an ice tea refill. This used to be a good place to go. Now it is a good place to avoid.< /Review>

The experience, atmosphere good. The acoustics bad, we could not hear our conversations. The beans no taste, rice a little dry. I like lettuce, but I noticed a lot of it under the main Food making it less dish.  Thank you for asking<//review>

< Review>
We've been going to the ORIGINAL Anita's for 40 years, and the new location came with great disappointment! Nothing tasted like it used to. The service was horrible, but the food was the worst Mexican food we've ever eaten! Our two boys ordered the 'Chicken Tenders' and they were served frozen Tyson Dino nuggets. The chicken in the soft tacos was bland, dry, and just gross tasting. Our daughters chimichanga was supposed to be beef and bean, instead it was some kind of inedible dog food. The shrimp and steak fajitas was an insult to steak and shrimp fajitas. Very dry flavorless shrimp, and tiny little worm like strings of meat. None of us ever want to go back to this place, which is so incredibly sad because it's been a family favorite for 40 years!!!! What happened? New owners? New kitchen staff? New menu? Honestly I wouldn't even feed my dog the "food" they serve here. Not worth the one star review.</Review>

The shrimp and steak fajitas was an insult to steak and shrimp fajitas. Very dry flavorless shrimp, and tiny little worm like strings of meat. None of us ever want to go back to this place, which is so incredibly sad because it's been a family favorite for 40 years!!!! What happened? New owners? New kitchen staff? New menu? Honestly I wouldn't even feed my dog the "food" they serve here. Not worth the one star review.</text>< rate>

I usually don't do reviews, but I had to as not only me but all others in my group felt the same way. Used to be great till they moved to the new location. Lost that home feel  and food just not that good. I mean you can definitely find better at a lot better price! $35 for 3 margaritas?? Total bill was $77! I had a chile verde burrito and Chile Relleno, neither was a good representation of the dish. Verde is green sauce and it was clear?? And not much flavor, and the CR was to have red sauce and it was very light. The others in the group had a tostada and enchilada and they where covered in sour cream!! Couldn't even tell what the dishes where..So Sad.< /text>

<name>Carlos Higuchi</name><pics>None< /pics><text>Sat at the bar. Service good. Drinks good. Food just ok. Had the carnitas burrito.  The pork was crispy and bit dry.  They put in avocado.  Needed green sauce with pork.  In a mexican restaurant that uses tabasco, cholula and tapatio for the picante sauce it not a good sign.  Was pouring in  red salsa from my chips to keep it interesting.  The beans bland.  More salt and lard. Finallt the little lettuce and chopped tomato very lonely on a hot plate.<//text></record>

Went to have dinner with a group of friends and the food was not brought out at a decent time. It was 9 pm and my boyfriend's food was still not out. We ended up asking them to make it to-go since every one was done eating and it was time to sing "Happy Birthday" ridiculous!< /Text>

Been coming to Anita's since 1986 when I was in the Corps. Food and service have always been too notch and  insistent. New location is a parking nightmare but just about everything else remained the same.<//review>

Been going to the downtown Anita's (Coast Hwy) since about 1978.  It's my wife's favorite Mexican food place.  We tried the El Camino location several times over the years but it has changed for the worse.  Someone told us that the El Camino location is not owned by the Coast Hwy folks.  Too bad.  Good location, but the food and service is not as good as downtown Anita's.  We're going today to downtown Anita's.  It's my wife's birthday and she requested we go there to celebrate.  Only happy to oblige.</text>

I've been eating here for many years. Food is the Best Mexican food I've ever eaten. The service is good & the prices are desent. I have a lot of Mexican reatives, it tastes just like homemade. The chips are thin & hot. The salsa is spicy but not too hot. But then I like hot.
The Anita's on El Camino is not associated with this one. Food isn't the same & the service is poor.<//Review>

Food was terrible and we could not eat it. Chicken was super salty with no seasoning (just salt). Crab tasted like it was from a can. We sent it back and they made us pay for it anyways. Yuck</text>

We're going to be so bummed when they move to South O this fall, a two block walk will require a quick drive down 101. My dog and I are big fans of the carnitas plate so I guess I have to knock it off with margaritas.< /Review>

<text>My first time eating there wasn't the greatest, but I have it another try and it was delicious. The only thing I didn't like (same as last time) was the service. Things were forgotten, food wasn't served together/properly, drinks were strong but poorly made, and it looks like it's always understaffed so you wait forever. Not sure the food was exactly worth it, but it was very tasty.</text>< pictures>

The food is Okay. Chips & salsa are good, the prices are decent. The meat in enchilada was not up to par, it looked like it was boiled and the taste was bland.< /text>

Restaurant was overcrowded and too warm even tho fans were on  The hostess only sat a few from our party while the rest had to wait until nearby patrons finished their meals.  Then their table was used to accommodate our entire party.  Drinks were weak & overpriced.  Food was not as good as you'd get from the local taco shop.<//text>
