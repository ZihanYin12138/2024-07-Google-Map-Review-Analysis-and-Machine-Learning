<Text>Business as usual and the business was good. Came in for an alignment. They noticed a questionable frame repair and instead of doing the alignment knowing it would be of dubious help, they informed me of this. And then refused to charge me.

<Text>I'm writing to express my heartfelt gratitude to the employees of the midus store at 7340 blackstone ave in fresno. I cant thank the people there enough for what they did for me. They went so far above and beyond I cant even put into words how amazing they were. I needed to have my brakes fixed as another midus did not live up to the standards that have been set by the people at this store and I wanted new tires for my car. Which they were able to help me with. I had an appointment on the 7th of October at 9am, but the night of the 6th, my father went into the hospital and I was told I may only have a few hours left with him. I left the hospital at about 830 in the morning on the 7th so that other family could visit with him, and I could drop my car off. Hearing the situation, I was given a ride back to the hospital completely free of charge, and when my car was ready I was even given an uber back to the shop, where my car was ready and paperwork was ready to get me out of the store in less then 5 mins and to get me back to the hospital as fast as possible. My dad passed later on the night of the 7th.... while my heart is broken with loss, your team of employees, made it where I was able to hold my dads hand, and be there with him for every minute that he had left. I cant thank your team enough for what they did for me. While this has been one of the hardest points in my life, it has been the best from a service stand point. I just want to thank your entire team, I'm sorry I can't remember names right now, my mind is all over the place, it took a few days to even be able to form words, but I just want everyone to know how far the team went out of thier way for me and what they did for me. Also the work they did was great, the new tires and the brakes having them work again means a lot to my family as I am on the road a lot for work. I know I didnt say enough about your team as it is still hard to get my thoughts out lately, but I just wanted to say thank you, and I hope you are able to see how much it meant to me what they did. You have a customer for life, thank you so much.

Service was fast. Raymond was extremely helpful. He didn't try and sale me anything I didn't need. He was very polite and professional.   I was out of there in less than an hour and I got my oil changed, tires rotated, and a new air filter put in. Plus all the other services they do as a courtesy check and they were open on the holiday, which was really convenient. Overall an A+ rating from me.< /review>

After having to wait a day because the one tech guy had a day off (not upset about that) I took my car in 9 am when they opened and again told him about the computer issue I may have had, I told him about all the electrical problems I had with the car. After having my car the entire day (it was now 4) I called them to check on my car and after 10 mins I get a call back to be told they didnt find anything wrong with it I get to the shop and talk to jason and he advises me that it is more then likely an electrical issues I'm having and must take it to the dealership.

<review>I had been going to Midas for years up until last year when I had a horrible encounter with their manager Chris. I wrote a review after that experience as I was very upset with what had happened. When I had arrived I witnessed the then manager Chris verbally cursing at one of his employees and was hesitant to go inside. Once dealing with him he was very argumentative and rude with me and I had never experience anything like that before. I decided I would not ever go back. My uncle had service with them a few weeks ago and told me that the store was under new management and that the new guy gave him a great deal on his breaks so I decided to give them another try. I called first and spoke to the new manager Gregory. He was super nice and told me he could get me in right away. When I got there he greeted me with a smile and listed to what I had to say. I wasn't sure what was wrong with my vehicle I just new that it pulling to the right when I was driving. He told me that they would check it out and let me know what was going on within the hour. I went to lunch and came back and he explained exactly what the issue was so that I could understand and didn't make me feel like I was stupid. He gave me a fair price to fix the issue and even offered me a coupon to add an oil change. They fixed the problem and I am very happy with my service. I will definitely make Midas my go to shop again.</review>< Pics>

<text>Nice and friendly workers and very fast service only problem is informational option and knowledge with what type of service is available for newer vehicles, never just put motor oil in a car that is not recommended by manufacturer.

<text>Used to like going here because they provided good cost and service. However, the one time I had my wife take the car for an oil change, they stated the CV boot was broken and wanted to charge $800 to replace it. I looked at it myself and also had another car repair shop look at it for a second opinion. There was nothing wrong with it. It's sad that they would try to take advantage of my wife when she does not have much knowledge about cars.</text><response>None< /response>< username>

He is nothing but rude to customer and even to his employees. I have had nothing but terrible experiences dealing with this guy. Even his employees have told me that they absolutely hate him. Obviously the owner doesn’t care about his staff or his customers based on the reviews for his stores. So I will no longer be going to any of their locations. You all should go to Les Schwabb.

< review>
I called around for a set of four tires for my Altima, and they were the best price in town and they offer free rotate/balance and flat repairs!  We I arrived they got me taken care of right away and were extremely friendly.  There ended up being a mistake in the tires I ordered but the fixed it and at no extra charge.  The manager there was super nice and one of the guys there kept answering ALL of my 3 yr old son’s questions.  HIGHLY Recommended!!</review>

Very professional and great service. I needed new brake rotors and I thought it was going to take 4 hours, the job got done in an hour and a half. I would definitely recommend people getting there car checked there.</text>

Use to be the only place I trusted, after someone told me there experience I ignored them. Took car in because of hard starting, $485 later still hard starting and feel stupid I didn't trust other reviews. PS You don't get money back from parts installed and labor, even if it didn't need to be done. Tires and oil, but nothing else, but I won't even give them that!</Text>

<Rate>2</Rate><Text>Not a great experience with this midas. Was going to use a groupon and I called ahead to make sure they would honor it and they told me not to buy the groupon they would just give me the price.  Went in for an oil change and they found $1900 worth of repairs that needed to be made on my car. I purchased the repairs. The next day I noticed that they put the wrong oil in my car and it was driving terribly. I called and asked if they could fix it and they tried to tell me it doesn't matter what kind of oil they use. I had them change it anyways. The car drove much better and they assured me I could have confidence in the rest of their work. A couple days later the grill from my car fell off while I was driving. Less than a month later my car started making a terrible clunking noise in the same area as some of the repairs. Since midas has a 90 national warranty I took it to a different midas, and sure enough the screws had come loose on the repairs done at this midas. I would go elsewhere.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80946802b820e243:0x85817393a88fbd38<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

He also tried to convince me that I needed $1000 in new tires when I took it in the first time. I took it to West Coast tires and Ford to make sure. Both companies said I didn't need tires!

DO NOT TAKE YOUR VEHICLE HERE. Doesn't even deserve 1 star. I took my car in for a $30 oil change and ended up spending $100 on service that "needed" to be done including "cleaning" the erosion on my battery and replacing the air filters. I asked to see my old filters and they were not in any condition to be replaced. After I checked under the hood the battery was still eroded. On top of it all the oil was leaking. Terrible service I would not suggest anyone going here. They would not refund either because they claimed they did it "right". If you did it "right" then why are you guys offering to fix it?< /review>

Their parts pricing is insane with over 100% mark up. Unfortunately I learned this after I had already agreed to the repair. This was my first and last time at Midas.< /Text>

After alignment of drove my car home when I step on the break my powers steering is shaking. When I get home I left my car up and check. I see the tie rod end out is bad the boots already rip off, i can wiggle by used my hand and also the sway stabilize bar both boots also tearing and Midas technician still do the alignment. There is telling me that Midas technician not certified to be technician mechanic. If Midas technician certify and have experience they should call me and tell me that tie rod end and sway bar need to replace before do alignments. This is my first time with Midas and never ever go there again. For those who don't know about alignments, the tie rod end out is to adjust the alignment so if the tie rod is bad and Midas technician still do the alignment them that telling me the technician don't know what they doing.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1470750482624, 'text': "Hi Chang, we're sorry to hear you've left our shop unhappy.

Dreadful Customer Service

This place is not even worth a single star.  I supposedly to have an oil change and transmission oil change on 12/29/2016 at 5:00p.m.. I was told by Angel Bernabe one of their employee that they are about to close and I should go back the following day. With just oil and fluid change Angel Bernabe said it's not gonna take more than an hour. I took my car in 8:00am 12/30/2016 and explained that I need my car before 12pm since I have other appointments.  I was promised a call by Angel Bernabe when it's done.  2hrs after 10:00am I made a follow up and was told that they were calling me (lies) since I didn't receive any calls. I was told that my radiator "NEEDS" flushing because it's low on fluids.  Radiator is 3 months old since I bought it, complete with all the coolant services with it. I was also told that steering fluid needs flushing which is not possible since I check it every week. Meaning they just want more money from the customer. Again a promise of calling me after the job is done.  it's almost 3 in the afternoon which is  6 hours from the promised time of pickup I showed up in the service center. When they saw me, I was told that they are on the phone trying to make a call to inform me for pickup (lies). I picked up my car and told them how disappointed I am with the service and they just shrugged it off and laugh about it. For the first time check engine light went off. A simple oil and fluid change brought me more headaches and a wasted whole day with all their lies. I would never recommend this Service Center. It was very disappointing.< /Review>

I did my oil change it took a hr then after they try to sell me on other stuff my car needed and I said no because I just wanted my oil change I get home told my husband I got it done he got upset cuz he could do it long story short he checked the oil change and they didn't tighten my filter and so the oil was dripping so eventually I would have to go back to them again o and they wanted me to get a alignment and my husband said I don't need one it just to waste more money ... So I'm sticking so my mechanic (husband) and not going there again<//Review>

<name>Desiree Freitas</name>< Review>
Been coming here for years, recently had a couple bad experiences with the younger staff and them muttering profanity and acting bothered when asked for products. Tried messaging owners privately to help resolve the issue, but was confronted angrily by them the next time I came in. Super unprofessional and beyond crazy. My son and I loved going here, he is super upset and how dare they put us in this position of not being able to patronize this place anymore after I tried to give them a heads up privately! I look forward to the next owners who buy this place.</Review>

<text>Such a quaint little store. They have a variety of chocolate, candy, and ice cream too, but I didn't try the ice cream. There is an old bank vault inside where they keep more candy and continuously run Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Nice place to stop for a little treat!</text><response>None</response>< GmapID>

< Review>
The store itself was very nice, the male cashier on the other hand was very rude to my 12 year old. When my son asked if he could enter the vault, the cashier responded "I already told you where it was at didn't I." Also, was very short with us and seemed to avoid making eye contact.</Review>

Yes, you can still purchase candies/gum
that perhaps you bought in the late 50's/early 60's. Sure brought back some memories. Like the candy cigarettes, gold nugget bubble gum, Beemans BLACKJACK gum, 7UP candy bars.< /review>

Really cool candy shop in downtown Sonora. Historic building, used to be a bank and you can walk into the old vault, which is the Willy Wonka room. They also serve ice cream.< /review>

After we visited the broad, we we're hungry so we came here on Sunday afternoon. We got lucky with finding a parking space right away when I turned into the plaza. Parking is a little intense. I heard there's parking lot behind the building.<//review>

A.MAZ.ING. Fabulous service. Knowledgable about the menu & wine choices as well as being super friendly & helpful. The calamari, very spicy, was the best & most tender calamari I have EVER eaten. I have eaten a lot of calamari, believe me! Couldn’t recommend this place more highly.< /Review>

What a fantastic dining experience! First timers here. Met a friend for dinner and had many items we all shared. The Asian inspired cauliflower appetizer was our favorite. The draft beers are local and delicious. Definitely coming back.< /Text>

<Review>The food is SUPERB! We ate the huge burger and the sausage flatbread. Both  dishes were excellent. The staff is couteous. I loved sitting at the window looking out to the street. Clean bathroom. Self-shot below show large lovely mirror in ladies' restroom. Means a lot when out on date. Lol.  Very quaint, vozy and welcoming restaurant.  Highly recommend it.< /Review>< Pics>

I am a HUGE fish n Chips fan.
I saw that on Wednesday ,Taste does Fish n chips. In LBC I enjoy fish n chips from Pike/ Roe/Saint &2nd,
BUT NOW there is a new # 1. Taste on Broadway.
Why: fish fresher , firmer , more flavorful.
Batter lighter almost tempura like but one can taste the mild Beer. Hardly any residual oil
Superb Sauce,they call it Garlic Aoli-Jalapeño
Deee-lish
Fries good too and portions plentiful
Heavenly
Wife had Fried Chicken sandwich that was great also.
Taste has a well thought out Beer and wine list that matched well with the food
highly recommend</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dd31acf019dc85:0xebf865b679b5bdd<//gmapID></record>

I enjoyed this place! The food was pretty good, especially for the price. The service was extremely nice, although our waitress could have come by to offer us water more often. The space is somewhat tight; I would estimate that the restaurant accommodates about 40-50 customers max. Of course parking is a hassle in this part of Long Beach, but there are some spots to be found after a bit of circling.

The burger was very tasty and had some topping that seems like a mixture of caramelized onions and a semi sweet fruit or something. It really enhanced the flavor of the juicy patty! The carbonara flatbread was also quite good, but I wish it had more chunks of crispy pancetta!< /Text>

I am vegan and although they didn't have anything explicitly vegan on their brunch menu the chef personally came out and offered to make me a hash dish that conformed to my diet and it was excellent. Great Bloody Mary's too!</text>

<review>A small restaurant in the Belmont Heights neighborhood that seats around 34 people, with a long communal table in the center, this is the place you would take a friend for conversation, special event and eventually catch up over the beer and wine they have here.

Speaking of which, if you come during happy hour 4-6pm, select wines (1 red, 1 white) are $5 and beers are $2 off. Some of the food selections are cheaper (It's a small menu and it's not online).

And if you do like the food and beverage selection, like other restaurants, they will have a beer or wine pairing dinner. Like Phamtom Carriage in the past or the Talley Winery in August.

The food here for the most part is tapa style, small shareable plates. We tried:

Albacore cerviche with the crispy won ton chips-Fresh dish, wished it was a little spicier or saltier, or more acidity. I think I'm used to more in your face flavor.

Indian Fry Bread-4 crispy pieces of fry bread with honey drizzle over them. The baba ganosh and the garlic dipping sauce was nice add on to this dish.

Vietnamese meatballs-7 juicy meatballs with dipping sauce and organic farm greens from Lot59 which is recommended to eat in one bite.  Yup, you guessed it, it tasted like Vietnamese pho or Banh Mi with those similar flavor profiles.

Pan seared Sea Bass with Ratatouille, Summer Garde Herbs, Green Olive-Celery Relish. Love this dish! Super slight crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside with fresh greens.

Berry crumble with pepper ice cream-This dish is not for everyone.  All the dishes here have a good balance of salty and sweet here. The pepper ice cream is overpowering and the berry crumble was, well a bit dry and it elevated the ice cream 3 notches in the pepperyness.

The menu changes here changes constantly as well as the beer and wine choices. So what you see here might be swapped out when you enter the restaurant. However, popular menu items does get brought back periodically.

Also got to try a glass of their tempranillo. Great selection for $8. I do have to say the wine choices here are quite wonderful. The beer selection is about 8 taps. Got to try SinTax from Mother Earth and it was on Nitro as well as the Alpha Galactic from Beachwood. Gotta support local, ya know? They do have a cider too here when I was here and it was called Moonlight Meadery. It was yeasty and tasted like a Berliner instead of a cider which I liked!

Finally, I like to say the staff here is superb. Anthony and Garrett knows the menu super well and takes great care of you.

The bathroom here is beyond the red door and is super big and clean.

4 1/2 for the food and 5 star for the service. Parking is free on the streets. Great place to hang out with time friends. Oh, please note that I was invited here as a guest to try these food and my opinions reflect that of a regular customer.   I will have to come back again!</review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Based on the reviews the place looked promising, however we were overall disappointed. The service is great, but the place is extremely loud (making it impossible to have a conversation). The food is good, not that special, but the portions are very small. In fact, too small to feel like your money is well spent.</Text>

I am thrilled my new insurance starts in August and I never have to visit this place again.

Some of the other ladies there are rude and short tempered for no reasons. The doctor that I had was Khoi Tran, and he was TERRIBLE! I was confuse on some of the procedures that I had to do and he got mad at me for not understanding and told me to get out of the room and go to the lobby. I had to wait for 30 minutes just to get help explaining about the procedure and things that is best to do. When doing the surgery, he and this lady was busy talking about other craps and I feel like he didn’t do a good job on my surgery.< /Text>< Date>

Probably the worst dentist me and my wife have ever been to. The front desk workers hardly get back with you to help with insurance or even email you any paperwork needed. The dentist took all of 60 seconds to give me a full exam and the cleaning the technician gave me consisted of putting paste on a power tool and basically brushing my teeth. I’ve never had a cleaning be this short and once I left my mouth felt no different than when I arrived. The only thorough exam they performed were the X-rays, which I assume was only for the money.< /text>

The first time I called to make an appointment, I was told to wait for a call from them, and only my phone number was taken down. I waited for two weeks before calling them back, and only then was any other pertinent information taken down, and an appointment was made. Then, at my consultation for a wisdom teeth removal, I was rushed to sign papers with little time to read them. At my actual appointment, the doctor didn't even greet me before looking at my x-rays. He refused to extract my wisdom teeth, and when I told him that they had been causing me pain every day for months, he simply said, "I doubt it." He even wrote down in my chart that I hadn't been experiencing pain!</review>< user_name>

<pics>None<//pics><rate>1< /rate><Text>This visit was one of the worst I've had in a while. I told them of pain I had in a tooth they worked on last time during my cleaning appointment. They said the only way to have someone look at it would be if they classify the appointment as an "emergency". I said sure as long as I get to have my scheduled appointment that I've waited over a month for. After waiting to be called and watched about 4 people go ahead of me which checked in after me, I was finally called to take x-rays and then set in a room waiting for over 30mins. Just for a man to look in my mouth, avoiding where the spot was on my tooth and just to tell me I should switch my tooth paste. Mind that this seems to be the same man who preformed my filling. And that I was good to go all under 5 mins. I tell him I still need my cleaning and exam that was scheduled and he says he'll go ask the nurses. I sit there long enough for the lights to go out like 3 times. Then a women says I'm all done for today and I'll have to schedule another appointment for the one I originally came it for. I check the time and see I've been there for nearly 2 hours. I left dissatisfied and irritated that they had wasted my time that I had waited over a month for. Horrible. Same with my last appointment that I had a filling. It felt as if it was just deteriorating within 2 or 3 days. During the filling I told them I felt a sharp pain, and the man said it's almost over instead of assessing the problem. And I also went home with weird scars on my cheek that I assume was from the curing light for my tooth. Two horrible appointments in a row.< /Text>< user>

This is the worst place ever. This place sent me emails and text messages constantly reminding me to reschedule my appointment that they canceled due to the coronavirus. When I responded and rescheduled they failed to tell me that my referral is expired 9 months ago. After driving a total of 2 hours, I realize that this place is not concerned about their customers. I can only imagine the care that they take when they're in your mouth.< /review>

This was a horrible experience Dr. Tran yelled at me and brought me to tears!! He does not speak or tell you what he is doing he does whatever he wants and then yells at you .

Ladies at the front are rude with an attitude problem. They should find a new job if they don’t like that one. Nobody answers the phones and they definitely don’t call you back. No help and bad service, and they don’t ever put in the notes what’s been discussed so nobody knows who helped you! I will never take my kids here. They said they’ll strap my child down and that if she cries they will have to stop and reschedule!!! Waiting for a referral to go somewhere else!!< /Review>

I hate the dentist. Well at least I hated the dentist until I met Dr. Santos. Now going to the dentist isn't so hard. You could tell Dr. Santos loves her job and cares. 💜 The ladies at the front desk are very friendly and nice.</Text>

< Review>
Decent experience.  Staff is friendly and good at their jobs.  Office is clean and modern, but it is a stark contrast from the neighborhood its placed in.  Two TVs in the lobby playing children shows usually.

Somewhat of a long wait to be seen, even with an appointment.  You will wait roughly 30m.  Been here a couple times so it seems consistently around 30m.

The biggest downside is that they schedule appointments at least three weeks out, so good luck if you need something done right away or miss your appointment.  The surgeon also only works 2 days a week by their own admission.  You can wait it out and see if they can fit you in, but it will take a few hours.<//Review>

I’ve been coming here for years I’ve always had issues with one thing or another ..
Until dentist dr Santos came to this office to work and made my visit worth every second
She is very professional and takes her time to make sure you get everything you need done!
Dr santos is very patient with her patients and treat them like their suppose to be treated
Best experience I’ve ever had here .< /text>

Literally stayed on hold for 30min. So I Called back again. Same lady whom transfer me, did it again. (guess what) Still No answer! At this point I got fed up it’s only 9:15am?!!!!! So I Went Up there Myself in person!!! Come to find 2 others waiting. The girls in the front was Shock that I told them I was he one calling n I was being transfer to the person who does the appointment!!! Finding 3 ladies up front n one in the back office!!!
Hmmm how bout that !?<//review>

<rating>1<//rating><text>DO NOT go here! If i could give ZERO stars i would. I have never been to a dentist office that makes the average patient wait more than 30min to be processed and seen by their Dr. I had an appointment at 1:30PM before checking in i had to sign in on a sheet, in order to be called to the desk. As i waited to be called i noticed the people who signed in after me, were being called up. I told the worker i think he skipped me, he looks at the sign in sheet and said "oh yes, sorry i must have over looked your name." Which should have been my first warning. After i turned in my paperwork i waited another hour just to be looked at and given X-rays. By the time the Dr came to my "room" it was 3pm, which he only stayed for 5 minutes. The whole visit from start to finish took 2 hrs.< /text>< resp>

<review>The first appointment took over a month to get. When I came in I was told the dentist called in sick and I needed to reschedule for 4 weeks out. They could have called ahead of time and let me know so I didn't have to take time off work, but they didn't.

The next appointment, I was told I have a cavity and to come back for a filling. I came back (again over a month later) and was told they made a mistake - there was no cavity.

They completely missed that my front teeth were cracked and I needed a root canal. It was only after I complained about pain that they looked at it. They only recognized one tooth was infected, but it turns out it was both front teeth (the specialist told me). Now I need to get another insurance authorization and make 2 extra appointments to get the needed work done.

They do not answer the phone. Even after leaving messages, sometimes they just don't call back. I've gotten some calls back, but because I work and have classes I've asked to be called back within certain time frames (several hours), and get called outside of those hours. There is an answering service, but they don't seem to be able to get ahold of the office either.
I was told by someone in the office she would call me back quickly. I waited two hours and never got a call back. I repeatedly called the office after the two hours, and no one answered. That's when I left a message asking to be called back the next day between 12pm - 3pm.

Angela with the answering service hung up on me after I asked to speak with someone higher up . I made it clear I just wanted help in getting an appointment since I have a temporary filling and need to get a crown very soon so it doesn't get infected. She hung up on me after I asked for her full name.

Arianna with the answering service at least didn't hang up on me, but was rude and implied I was lying.

There's an X-ray guy who's very nice, but everyone else seems to be rude and not very helpful.</review>< Pics>

When I arrived I already was defensive based on reading reviews, but they helped me immediately when I asked firmly for the papers I needed fill out, and to proceed with my appointment. They all had great attitudes and answered every question I had. My paperwork was properly handled and the doctors/assistants treated me with genuine care and help.</review>

(If only zero stars was an option)As another woman stated earlier, I would rather go through child birth again as well!!  Literally told my boyfriend that when I got home.  I had my last wisdom tooth removed, worst pain ever.. cracked my tooth into four pieces. The doctor told me to be quiet, nurse was no help.  Front desk is horrible.  I got to deal with all that after waiting 2 hours to be seen. Theeeen 5 days later I find part of my tooth is still there!!! I call the lady says you can schedule a  apportionment.  WORST PLACE EVER! And don't be confused my the nice building picture listed, it's a dump.< /text>

I have a tooth infection that's been going on for 4 months.  I'm getting dental through disability and is covered for the extraction at Bluehill dental.  But they scheduled my appointment 2 months out, wich is a long time to to have an infection.  They are also trying to change me to take the tooth out, which I'm covered for. The insurance rep have to repeatedly call and talk to them. And they are very rude and insensitive to others. Especially the once that work in the front😕😕😕</Review>

I was nervous coming here after reading reviews. I have medí-cal so I figured I’d be treated terrible. But I must say this was a wonderful experience. Considering the fact. lol. I came for wisdom teeth removal. One was sideways so it needed oral surgery. I was super scary. But everyone from front desk to dentist made me feel comfortable. The X-ray guy is great. Super funny and made the time there less stressful.
I’ve had terrible experiences before at other offices so I was scared. But the dentist was great. He was a younger guy. And he walked me through step by step of what was happening. And made it as painless as possible. They even talked me out of spending money on nitrous. So all in all. Great experience. I would give more stars if I could. Would definitely come back. And refer friends. I honestly don’t know why they have such a low rating. Place is clean and new. And everyone is friendly.</Text>

<Review>Had two teeth pulled today by what dentist? I couldn't tell you because he didn't introduce himself...He came in the room and stood beside me watching Tom and Jerry on T.V. for a minute. He didn't even say 'hello' or anything! He told me to put my head back and injected Novocaine in both sides of my mouth, pretty roughly. One side wasn't even numb enough and I was squirming around and letting him know it was hurting, he kept pulling until it was out!  It was the worst experience I've ever had at the Dentist!< /Review>< pics>

I have been trying for the last 3 days to get a hold of a person over the phone. They never answer and they never call back. I assist many of our patients in getting dental care and I may have to change to a clinic that knows how to answer a phone or call back.< /Text>

This is like the worst places to ever come. They will make you wait 1or 2 hours on the back just to check you. Also they will treat you different if yoi have med-cal they will make you wait months for an appointment and if you have insurance threw your job the treat you nice and gives yoi an appointment the next day. I say this for experience.< /Text>

Worst place ever... Sad that a few are certified... As for the receptionist they need classes on customer service skills and not make excuses... They lose charts and blame each other and its sad when being a patient you see it happen... I've seen some workers moved to other Acces Dental Office around Sacramento and there doing great... I believe its the management fault for not observing there staff at that area... No matter how bad the area is its how you treat a patient... As for the X-ray guy your doing great... Being a patient waiting for an hr to two is ok due to other critical issue, but when they fail to help a patient and all start blaming each other is a fail..< /review>

The worst dental place in Sacramento.
From front desk to the Doctor.
I had my teeth pain and I went to this location they
told me to do the root canal and asking about $1800
I decided to pulled my teeth. The Dr who pulled my teeth was very mean and not nice at all !
I do not recommend this place to you .< /text>

Steer clear from this gimmick dealership

If I could give them 0 stars I would. ZERO stars for wasting my time. They didn’t value my time even though there email says. Don’t believe there “Contactless car purchase” gimmick. It didn’t work even when I was pre approved from my bank and live 2,000 miles away. They will waste your time. I searched far and wide for a particular SUV with the options we wanted. From the moment I saw it, I wanted to make a down payment to hold vehicle.  I’ve done all my due diligence before contacting them and wanting to buy. The sales person Hector told me “I’ll email you the contract for method of payment to secure down payment” TWICE and I never received it. Then he had the audacity to ask my email again after we had initially spoke via email then to text. Completely waste of energy and time, would not recommend them from anyone out of state looking to purchase.

He said that someone came in, test drove vehicle and bought it within the day on a Wednesday. I inquired about this vehicle on a Monday evening ready to buy, had payment secured with the bank for them by Wednesday and he passed me like I was dirt. They will only cater if you’re in house and show up to the dealership to buy. Poor customer service skills and poor follow-up. First and last impression.

Drive away!

Be careful who your sales person is too.</Review>

< review>
Bought an R8. Domenico was my point of contact. Excellent price. Exactly as advertised. Up front about everything, even the car's downfalls. I flew in from the midwest to drive it home. It performed exactly as advertised and I look forward to many years of enjoyable ownership thanks to Dom and his team. A disclaimer for any buyer. Used cars are sold as is. Do your research. Ask the right questions. Know exactly what you are getting and plan accordingly. You can find a great deal. No one will answer a question you haven't asked. M sport motors answered all of my concerns thoroughly, but I asked. Dom will be honest and will tell you exactly what you are buying and admit what he doesn't  know. Happy buying, and thanks M Sport Motors. PS: I have to add, the next lowest price I found on a similar car was about $15,000 more.</review>

I had the BEST experience at this dealership. I came in with not so good credit and high expectations. With the hard work, attention, and dedication of Alexi, I was able to drive off the lot with the car of my dreams!! It has been just 2 months shy of a year and my Range Rover Sport is still a beauty. She drives well and I have experienced zero issues. There was even still a almost a year left of the manufacturer warranty on the vehicle; which is was a plus!

Thank you to Alexi and Management at M Sport Motors for making this happen for me! You made my car dreams come true.<//Review>< pictures>

Go to Hector! He’s the best! He helped me get my 2010 BMW M6! I got exactly the right spec that I wanted and I was able to negotiate off an already good price. If it weren’t for Hector I probably would have gone elsewhere, but I really liked the fact that he helped me throughout the whole process and told me my different financing options. I ended up leaving the lot with my new-to-me M6, thank you Hector and M Sport team for helping me with getting my dream car!</Text>

Purchasing a vehicle from MSport Motors was the easiest and stress free experience ever. Not to mention, Luis Gomez, had a lot to do with it. Not only he made me feel at ease, but the transparency and knowledge he gave me was really above and beyond what I expected. MSport Motors is the only dealership I recommend to my friends and family! Thank you  Luis Gomez!! 👍🙏🏻</Text>

Absolute rip off artists! Stay away from this car dealer, everything that they communicate to you is probably false. Their cars look nice but they have probably done the minimum amount needed to sell the car. These people are the reason why used car salesmen are considered predatory and dishonest.</Review>

I had a great experience with this dealership! I purchased a Tesla and the transaction was very smooth! I had interaction with most of the staff and they were helpful and professional. My primary contact ROY was awesome! They honored the price that I had seen the previous week which was much lower (almost $4000) The car could have easily been sold for the higher price but they kept their word and they did not have too! Go visit for yourself, I am a satisfied customer.< /text>

<Text>I've recently visited M Sport Motors to trade in my vehicle and get a new one. The only reason I chose this dealership was so that I could continue to work with Domenico. I had worked with him in the past at another dealership, and he helped save me money! He is honest, professional...simply put, I trust him. As for the dealership they have a great selection of cars.

I recently worked with Alexei.  He and all the guys there were laid back yet knowledgeable.  Alexei was really up front about pricing and financing, worked with me on the sales price, and was able to get me a fantastic finance rate for a used car purchase (3.5%).  I got a really good deal.  I would purchase used from M Sport again!<//review>

Great experience!! I found Joel Benjamine very personable, knowledgeable and quick to respond to emails, he's punctual and courteous. He listened to every request/question I had and gave helpful, thoughtful answers. He made it all so easy - I'd recommend Joel to anyone wanting any one in the market for a M Sport Motors. And the car is a lot of fun, too!<//Text>

After being reassured that the car was in perfect shape from the sales women, I flew from another state to come have a buyers inspection done from another dealership and a test drive. Well it didn't pass and had some modifications done so this 9XXX mile car might as well had 90,000 miles. needless to say I had to fly home empty handed and spent over $2500 just to find out I wasn't gonna buy it.  do your research first!!!!<//Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>I've recently visited M Sport Motors to trade in my vehicle and get a new one. The only reason I chose this dealership was so that I could continue to work with Domenico. I had worked with him in the past at another dealership, and he helped save me money! He is honest, professional...simply put, I trust him. As for the dealership they have a great selection of cars. If you're looking for a great deal on a great car Domenico is your man and M Sport Motors is the place to go!</Text>< Pictures>

I recently worked with Alexei.  He and all the guys there were laid back yet knowledgeable.  Alexei was really up front about pricing and financing, worked with me on the sales price, and was able to get me a fantastic finance rate for a used car purchase (3.5%).  I got a really good deal.  I would purchase used from M Sport again!<//Text>

First off when I went to this dealership I was amazed of the cars there and how clean they looked. This dealership maybe the best one I’ve been to and I have been to a lot of dealerships.The best client I approach was to Hamid. Hamid was just amazing and he gave good service to me and provide me with all the information I needed. If I could recommend anybody to you to help you buy a car, I would definitely recommend Hamid.</review>

<text>Craig was very insightful and clearly knew what he was talking about. I have been car shopping for a few weeks now, and I haven't met  or spoken with a salesman as polite or honest as him. I had a stress-free experience, and didn't feel pressured into a sale. I would definitely recommend this place, and if you do pay them a visit, I would definitely recommend talking to Craig.< /text>< Pics>

I drive up from San Francisco, and when I show up he informs me another salesman has already sold the car the day before. Disappointing.

Amazingly transparent, honest and approachable dealership. I had initially gone there with the sole intention of appraising my Porsche 911. However, after a very pleasant afternoon spent with the owner, Brian, not only did I sell Brian my 911 at an absolutely fair price, I also concluded two other separate  deals with him - sale of my BMW 740, and the purchase of a stunning M235. He conducts his business with ethical clarity, opening up his books to show me the auction price he had paid for the M235, reviewing the KBB trade-in and retail prices, and never once pushing or pressurizing me to make a deal. His financial manager, Tim, sourced an attractive financing rate that met my needs. In all, a very rewarding experience at a dealership with excellent high end inventory at most reasonable prices.</Text>

The cars on their lot are well detailed and look clean, and the folks working here are sweet, and I truly don’t mean to stereotype but this is still a used car dealership. I drove a 2014 Subaru WRX with 54k miles on it, and a fair bit of interior wear (more than the average), that was priced at over $24k. The KBB value on the car was $19k, but they insisted on using their own pricing tool that valued that car at $23.5k, and they were not willing to negotiate at all. This would be a good dealership to buy a car that would normally be really expensive at a brand dealership, like a BMW, Audi, or Mercedes, but for something like a performance model Subaru, Honda, or even Mitsubishi, the amount of car you’re getting for M Sport’s price, will not be a great value in my opinion.< /Text>

If you’re looking for a car MSports is the place to end up! Excellent customer service and great Inventory. I worked with Domenico! He was very nice and honest and will tell you everything you need to know about the car! I would recommend them to anyone!</review>

I received great service from Domenico. I called M Sport 25 minutes before I arrived and he had the Maserati Ghibli waiting for me when I arrived. After a pleasant test drive, negotiations went smoothly and I purchased the car. He followed me home with the car I came in then Ubered back to the dealership. He also arranged to take care of some minor road rash on one of the rims. I would definitely consider M Sport Motors and Domenico for future car purchases.<//review>

<rating>1</rating><Text>After one month of purchasing the car, I have had issues with the car starting, service lights, and faulty sensors.

Following up with additional details a few months later...I have spent close to $2K on this Mini in the first 4 months of ownership - torque mount, valve covers, high pressure fuel injector, and carbon removal. My round trip commute is 20 miles a day, and this car is not reliable. Incredibly disappointed in the integrity of this dealership.< /Text><userid>102271150095104999899< /userid><gmap_id>0x80856175c0eaf745:0xc7c866bd164f7b47<//gmap_id>< resp>

< Review>
Was interested in purchasing a BMW from this dealer. Contacted Vi and setup a PPI to be performed on the car. After paying for the PPI and getting the results back I made an offer on the car. Was told by Vi that she would get back to me later that day to see what the manager said. No call that night, no call the next day. After 3 days went by I contacted Vi only to be told the car just sold 3 days after she told me "Ill get back to you."  Vi dropped the ball on this one and I missed out on the car along with my $250 I paid for the inspection. The entire time dealing with Vi I got the feeling she was not on the ball. I wish I would have picked a better sales person. I also left messages for Bryan the sales manger to call me so I can get the deal done but he never returned any of my messages. Overall a very bad experience with this dealer. Not happy!<//Review>

Avoid this place at all costs. Their inventory is generally nicer cars but they did try to pass off a wrecked and improperly repaired low-mileage BMW M3 as if it were never in an accident, since the repairs did not show up in CarFax even though the car still had broken bits under the hood after a close inspection, and I spoke with a prospective bidder present at the auction the wrecked car went through before ending up at M Sport to confirm my suspicion. That type of blatant dishonesty ensures I will not be returning next time I'm in the market for a BMW.<//review>

<Review>I have been emailing them and I'm an out of state buyer. My God it's like I'm speaking a completely different language with this dealership. I'm asking really simple stuff like "what are the numbers for it to pass CA state inspection regarding the brakes and tire tread length" and I'm getting the answer of "it has 40 percent of its life left" and "tires are ok". What is that in Millimeters? Tires are Ok millimeters? Brakes are at 40 percent millimeters? I need this info for my own state inspection, I've just never had a kind of dealership just spout features in response to my questions like I cant read what it has already. My favorite part was the salesman asking me to pay for another inspection to confirm it's ok. Let's get this straight PAY for something for a truck I might not even buy, might as well light it on fire so I can actually get something useful out of that money.

It's like the sales team didnt even learn what their own state inspection covers and are not really into cars at all. The truck is nice but if I cant even get simple technical questions answered, why bother? They must deal with clients with more money than sense because it's been a ridiculous experience.< /Review>< pics>

He said yes, but when i got there anthony said he has a deposit on that one but we have another one same color and similar mileage and said we can't sell for online price cause we own that one at higher price which he quoted $11,900 Sounds to me like bait and switch<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

While processing paperwork Vi put some fuel in it as I had a long drive home and the tank was on empty. I did notice a chip in the paint before purchasing, which I asked if they had someone who could fix it. Within a few days they made an appt for me to come in and they touched up the spot for free. They also stored my other vehicle for me (as I was by myself and did not trade it in) behind a locked gate until I could pick it up the next day. I believe I got a great deal on my car (price negotiated to the number i was hoping to spend) and a pleasant experience. Walked out very happy.

<text>Salesman here had a '16 STI and insisted that the wheels on his car from a '14 or older STI were stock from the factory. He went as far to say that Subaru had left over stock from 2013 and put them on his 2016. What??? I'm a Subaru enthusiast and I've never seen those wheels on that year car in the dozens of meets I've been to....

Just goes to show the salesmen here have no idea what they are talking about, their own cars. You've been warned.</text><Date>1493108477068<//Date><rate>1< /rate></record>

This was my 2nd Range Roover purchased from M & M Motor Sports. My 1st experience was so amazing that I had to go back when it was time for a new one. I have always hated car shopping until I ran into Ibrahim the best car sales person ever. Very knowledgeable and GREAT customer service from the start to the finish. The owners also make you feel so comfortable and like you are family. I have posted them on my Facebook page as the dealership to go to when you need a new car:)<//Review>

Price was bluebook, but what can I say, but a bunch of liars.
was told vehicle would have gas when I picked it up, and it didn't almost on E,
Then I asked if they were gonna put gas in it, and the paperwork guy acted like I said something horrible.
The salesman was good, but didn't have any authority to do anything at all.The most ridiculous part is I get my registration, Which was $580 and Its already due in 4 months, which means it was
7 months expired when I got the vehicle.

Very shady place. Dealer lied and said vehicle was pampered by prior owner with no noticeable blemishes. Turns out they bought the car at auction and hadn't even brought the car into their shop yet when they began to advertise. The car was full of blemishes which needed to be addressed once the car arrived across the country but they just washed their hands of any false advertising responsibility. I later saw the same exact word for word description on other vehicles for sale.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) I loved that Luis speaks Spanish. Everything was fast and pleasant.
He answered all my questions and helped me choose my new car.

He reset my settings on my broken computer and let know to just purchase a monitor since my desktop was fried. He saved me a good $500 which geek squad and HP were both charging me an arm ,a leg plus my soul for something that isn’t even worth it. Thanks for looking out John.</review>< pics>

Probably one of the last mom and pop computer stores in riverside. The man running this store is extremely helpful kind and genuine. Really affordable and fast service highly recommended! Why waste your time trying to fix your own computer for months when you can come here and get it fixed in a day!<//review>

Repaired my laptop, replaced the fan. They ordered the part, then called me to bring it in. Took about 2 hours. Quick and fair priced! 😊< /review>

Probably the best thing you can experience at a service/repair shop of any kind is getting genuinely good advice from a knowledgeable owner or employee WITHOUT them trying to sell you something. The man does great work, and helped me out with another issue with instructions on what I could do about it myself rather than paying extra. Will definitely be going back for any future computer troubles, can't recommend enough!< /text>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I have worked with more than a few computer stores and techs.  I use to own a large electronics business, we had more than a hundred computers and a large network to support it along with our own in-house tech support who was very experienced.  But I have to say that Human Computers is my new computer store.  John was very fast, courteous and knowledgeable.  He know his stuff. I had a major problem, a person hacked my computer delegated all my passwords and took control of my computer.  Ever other computer store said that they would have to delete all my files and wipe the computer before reinstalling windows.  I had 4 years of business files that I could not loose.  He was able to fix the problem in just a few hours in the same day.  Thanks John you’re the best.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

< Review>
I took my iMac 27 2013 in for repair. It was running like a slug. Over a two week span, my computer got slower and slower until every little task would take a long time. The little spinning wheel just kept spinning! I used my disk utility and did everything I was supposed to with no luck. Apple has everything shut down so I couldn't take it to Apple. I was very lucky to hear about Human Computer. My computer was repaired and updated with a solid state hard drive. My Mac runs like a Jet !
Thank you John for your great and prompt service! I would recommend the Human Computer to anybody looking for good and honest service.< /Review>

<review>This place is great! I needed an older processor in order to update the BIOS on my board which was not compatible with the latest processor without the update. They sold me an older cpu to use and then I was able to return it when I was done. It was a good price and I would definitely recommend this company to anyone with computer needs.< /review><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

<text>Spectacular service, brought in a laptop with a broken keyboard, the price for service and parts are fairly reasonable. I was given a week time period, turns out it only took 3 days. Excellent for quick fixes and the like, going to come again for some performance improvements.</text>< pictures>

I was happy with the service and help they provided for me. I came in with my MacBook having a problem with not turning on and was worried that I had to get a new MacBook. I bought MacBook charger block from them a while back and exchanged my old block with a new block for free. They helped me solved my solution quickly and didn’t charge me at all. Thankful for their assistance and will be back for sure if there are any issues about technology!<//text>

My computer stopped getting power after changing my motherboard and case so I called the shop and took it in. They solved the problem within the hour and gave advice on what parts to get for my computer later on. If you have any computer issues definitely call this shop I guarantee they are the best in the area.</text>

The must go to stop shop for all your computer necessities. I must admit I was neverous to have someone else build my first computer, but wow. The job of perfection Human Computer did is unspeakable. My pc runs very quiet and better than expected. Must give credit to the owner who is very nice and hardworking.<//text>

I brought my laptop in because I had a cracked screen. The man was very kind and asked when I needed it by. I replied a week and he called me in two hours with the job finished. The pricing is not bad and service was excellent 10/10 recommended.<//text>

I’m not big on reviews but if any company deserves a five star review it is Human Computer. This is the only place I’d recommend for computer / tech repair. John is brilliant and seems to be able to fix anything. He is extremely honest and completely transparent throughout the repair process so there are no surprises when it comes time to pay your tab.</text>

More than grateful for this computer establishment. I recommend everyone with any computer needs to go here first.  The most honest person. Not only saved me from wasting money on an upgrade that wouldn't have been in my best interest, but set me up with more than I ever dreamed possible.< /text>

I have worked with them 3 times now. The first time he put a new hard drive in an old laptop. The second two times I went in with a laptop that wouldn't start. Both times I had really big projects for clients due and they got to my laptop right away and fixed it for me.

Their service and the prices are great. I have a lot of faith in what he tells me. He is a trusted service provider. I won't hesitate to go back again if I need help with my computer again.<//text>

I took in my desktop that kept freezing. I thought it might be a power supply issue but when I took it in but John thought it was a defective video card. He removed the card and it seemed to work fine until I took it home. Long story short, it ended up being the keyboard. It was the last thing that anyone would look at. John provided me with an old keyboard that worked and when I offered to pay for his time he politely declined me paying for his time and even the old keyboard. He may not have made any money from me that day but he will definitely get an opportunity to earn it back the next time I have a computer issue. I now trust him for being honest and will use him again and again. thank you.< /Text>

<Text>I  love this place. I will never buy a computer   or phone from anyone else.  John and Mike were extremely helpful and patient.  Much more affordable than best buy!

I recently bought a used phone from here and it turns out that not all of the screen sensors worked. I called the shop and the same day they replaced it with a brand new phone and I love this phone. The service was great and both John and Mike were understanding and accommodating! Life time customer!< /Text><UserId.>110235499421765779767< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

My very first time going to a place to get my laptop fixed and loved it here! Great customer service and well priced! I felt very good about dropping off my computer here. I was surprised to be able to pick it as soon as i did!

Now I am able to do work on my laptop without it being so slow! Definitely going back if I ever need to! Would definitely recommend this place to family and friends! 😊</Text>

<review>I recently suffered major water damage to a laptop that I use every day for work. I was referred to take my laptop in to Human Computer and BOY am I glad I was. John is my savior! He was able to recover all of my information off my old hard drive and transport in to my newest computer and it was like nothing had ever happened. He was so kind to even supply me with an extra hard drive back up in case I have another accident in the future. I'm so grateful for his services and have already referred him to a friend of mine.

Thank you John and Human Computer!<//review>< pictures>

I use my computer every day for work, so being without it for even a short time is extremely stressful. Human Computer was recommended to me by a friend and I gave them a try.  I am so impressed! A 24 hour turn-around time! I have my computer back and I am at my desk, back to work. AND I was charged the lowest amount I had been quoted over the phone in my initial call. Seriously,  how often does that happen?!  Thank you from the bottom of my heart!<//text>

I purchased a referb laptop for my wife from John several months ago.  An issue developed with the CD drive and I brought it back.  As soon as I walked in John greeted me by my first name, shook hands, asked about my work, and then asked what's up. Made me feel like I've known him for years.  He took care of the problem right away with no charge.  He knows that I will be coming back for my next computer purchase. And I know that I will.< /review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Great place to take your computer if it gets a virus or has problems. The people are friendly,honest in their dealings with you and reasonably priced. They are truly professional and get the job done. It is so nice to find a reputable, friendly place to turn to when your computer goes kaput!<//Text>

They are the best computer store in Riverside. Extremely friendly and helpful and got me in and out immediately. They knew what they were doing and all their prices are reasonable! You might not even be able to find it lower anywhere else! I would definitely come back for all my computer problems.< /text>

I’ve hated my computer for a year now!! Then I saw a recommendation on “Nextdoor” for computer repair. I went in and met with Mike ( great guy and funny) I wasn’t expecting too much but he said they would take a look. A day later I have my computer back and I love it. It’s so much faster than when I even bought it!!! Thanks Human Computer!!!<//review>

I have been going there for years.  Always helpful and informative.  Would not consider going anywhere else, they can be trusted.  I have bought my last  three computers there and a used on for my sewing machine.   I have gotten virus in the past and they were quick to fix and the price was right.  I live in Norco and go out of my way to go to them.<//text>

Excellent Service! Walked in to the shop today looking to get my laptop screen fixed. John was very professional and gave me multiple options on my broken screen. He told me an hour to complete the service and he called me about 40 min later saying it was ready for pick up! Very fair prices! Highly Recommended :)< /Text>

The best service and price in Riverside. I've been here twice. The first time was a quick fix---free of charge. The second time they took the task urgency seriously and completed in less than an hour. As to the price, the best you can have in town.</Review>

<review>came in yesterday looking for a good solid laptop, with either a gaming laptop or workstation laptop in mind.  They do have a really good selection on pre owned gaming laptops, many in immaculate condition.  I went back today to pick up the one I had chosen (which they were happy to hold for me)  I went with a really nice MSI laptop, which they sold to me for a really good price for the specs it had.  Check these guys out, they really do have a good selection of computers of all specs.<//review>< username>

John convinced me several months ago to NOT pay him to transfer my files to a new computer and helped me find the way to  do it myself.   This month he did a quick turnaround pulling my hard drive from a problematic lap top and transferring my .pst files to a new computer.    I have always gotten straight answers, sound counsel and effective troubleshooting and repairs at Human Computer.<//review>

I have been a customer of Human Computer for years. Their customer service has more than earned my loyalty. Their prices are very reasonable, customer service is professional and personable, and they have NEVER let me down!

Most recently, my hard drive on my laptop crashed and it seemed that there was no way to retrieve the files. They worked tirelessly to save everything for me. I got my computer back like nothing had ever happened. And the cost to fix it was less than what they quoted me. NOBODY does that!</Text>< UserId.>

Hi I'm a first time customer and I brought in my desktop for a blue screen of death issue John and Mike and another gentlemen who I didn't get the name of helped me out without an issue they asked me about my problems and I left it with them, within twenty four hours they had fixed my computer and addressed why there was an issue and went over why I should right this time and recommended an SSD Drive which I'm extremely grateful for. The quality of service for outweighs the price they charged me at the end of the day. They are great people and I plan on doing all future business with them and no one else you can't go wrong!< /review>

These guys are awesome.  They're very knowledgeable, professional, and friendly. They spent a lot of time talking to me about my hardware issues and answering all of my questions.  I brought in a custom built laptop that suddenly started suffering from GPU overheating issues, making it nearly unusable.  Stan Kim was able to diagnose the cause and fix it within 3 hours of me dropping it off.  I would highly recommend Human Computer to anyone in need of a software or hardware issue.  In the future if I have any more problems, I will most certainly be returning to Human Computer< /text>

Very nice and helpful.  Quick to help with carrying in items (as I walk with a cane).  Did not immediately try to upsell me like many other retailers often do.   Mike gave my computer tower a quick clean out with his air compressor, and was very patient when I had a major senior moment , drawing a blank on my password to log onto the computer (wow, embarrassing!  LOL ) I highly recommend this business, based on my first impression and on the many positive reviews before mine!< /Text>

I took my laptop to Human Computer, because my mom had gone there before, and I had read some reviews online that were positive.  When there, they told me what problems they thought my laptop might have, and said how long it would take.  They got the job done earlier than anticipated, and it works wonderfully!  I was not charged a crazy sum, but actually really reasonable.  They fixed the problem well!<//Text>

I took my laptop in because I kept getting the dreaded blue screen error.  Stan helped me and when I explained I work from home and need my laptop he rushed to help!!!  I almost cried when he told me he finished it and to come pick it up.   Hopefully I never need His services again but if I do this is the place I am taking my laptop!!!  Highly recommend!!!<//Review>

<gmapID>0x80dcb0c8bf459acd:0x46a44d1135b3dc86<//gmapID><text>I recently built a computer for the first time and after I was finished, the monitor wasn't detecting the signal. I took it to this place and the people working there said although they aren't able to inspect the motherboard or the cpu, they would at least be able to test the other possible problems, such as the memory, the graphics card, and simply the correct wiring. After not having a computer for 3 weeks, I was desperate for some kind of answer. After approximately an hour or two, they called me and said they found what the issue was and even went to the lengths of showing me that it actually works.

I additionally told them that I was planning on installing Windows 10 via a USB drive and they had me try installing it right there so I wouldn't need to come back. I guess I had the wrong kind of flash drive, so they decided to install Windows 10 for me so I could just type in the Activation Key I had after they were done installing it.

I am currently typing this review on the PC they helped fix, so I can assure you that their services are wonderful and I plan on going there again for a future visit! (They also do data recovery, but they're nice enough to let you try data recovery for yourself before offering you their services.)

Very nice and humble people.</text>< date>

After several attempts to have human computer fix my laptop they informed me I should buy a new one (which they gladly sold me) as the hard drive was out in mine. I was told the new one was as good as or better than the one I had. After using the new one I released it was not as fast as the old one. I suppose if you know anything about computers this might be the place to go. If you are computer handicapped as I am you might want to go someplace where someone will take the time to explain your options. I have several other problems which I assume is between my chair and keyboard and will just deal with till I find someone to go over it with me. This is why I went to H C so I could get some personal service, unfortunately when I go back in there is another $75--$85 charge to complete what I thought was part of the original agreement .</text>

I’ve been a customer with The Human Computer for the last 15 years and I have zero disappointments very upfront and Their prices are reasonable if you can’t afford a computer he can work with you on it I’ve purchased over $9000 worth of computers from him and has no complaints on the condition</text>

<review>(Translated by Google) The computer has not failed again, it is a short time but I have confidence in the man who attended to the delivery before the stipulated apparently his reputation is justified.

< review>
I purchased some of the hard lotion bars. I have found them to be everything they claimed. The shipping was quick and the communication with what other products they produce is very educational. I have learned so much about what natural products can do for my body. It helps knowing what is exactly in the products before purchase so you will know if you are likely to have a reaction. I highly recommend giving them a try.</review>

<Text>I learned of MadeOn Skin Care through a Christian sight, and in purchasing a Christian Bundle was offered a product from MadeOn Skin Care.
I purchased some products and just love the soaps and lip balm, the lotion bars are wonderful. I didn't know such wonderful soaps existed. I also received  my package in a timely manner. A great group of people to deal with. I suggest you try it.</Text>< Response>

An an ER nurse my hand washing and sanitizing are over the top, it leave my hands and cuticles dry and cracked. This MadeOn skin softening bar has been my best purchase ever. My hands are so soft. I also use it on my feet and elbows. I can't recommend this product enough. I will be a forever loyal customer!!<//text>

<Review>I’ve been a customer of MadeOn’s for over 3 years & they have the best customer service & truly natural products! My skin drinks up Bee Silk, Bee Silk Jr., & the Simply Shea Facial Emollient, leaving it baby soft & smooth. The scented lotion bars are a big hit with my family & friends & MadeOn comes out with great limited edition/seasonal scents which are fun to gift. Be sure to keep some for yourself though! There are about 5 other lotion sticks we use all the time, with Bee Cool & Simply Soothing Rash Cream being standouts. I’m so happy to support this business.< /Review><user_id>100126787546043239889< /user_id>< Resp>

I tried the Bee Silk bar only after trying their amazing chapstick (that keeps my daughter’s lips from chapping), and wow am I impressed! I NEVER have soft skin...my husband, my sister, my mom would always tell me to put lotion on my hands, but nothing seemed to EVER work. Until Bee Silk bar! I literally applied it 4 times over a 2 day span and my skin was touchable and no longer cracked and bleeding. After 4 days, I only use it at night. My husband told me I should have been MadeOn’s testimony... it works. Really well. Better than expected. I will be a life long customer. Thank you!!< /text>

Absolutely love every MadeOn Skin Care item I have used.  As an RN and Mom, I wash my hands so frequently that they are often dry and chapped.  Especially with all that hand sanitizer during this pandemic!!  I use the lotion bar after showers and before bed and my hands look amazing!! I love the lip balms, the muscle rub stick, the goat milk soap....all wonderful products for my family's sensitive skin!!</Text>

I ordered several items from MadeOn and was so excited about the Bug Bar. After trying it, I almost immediately found 3 mosquitoes on my leg. Our mosquitoes are very aggressive and I am a favorite of theirs. I contacted customer service and received a reply and incredibly generous offer within 24 hours of contacting them. I love the lotion bar, soap and lip balm. Because of their "above and beyond" customer service, I am a customer for life. The items were beautifully packaged and so enticing that if I hadn't wanted them myself, I would have gifted them to my daughter who just had a baby... lucky me, I kept them!<//text>

<review>MadeOn skin care was just what I was looking for to help with dry skin. So easy to apply and carry with me anywhere I go. The ordering process was easy and shipment was fast. The peppermint chapstick is the best, I will be ordering everything again and can’t wait to share with my family.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Received MadeOn Skin products for my birthday😀😀 Since then I have reordered. I enjoy working and weeding in our yard, so along with that comes  achy muscles . My favorite two products are Bee Cool and Foot Rub they are very soothing to the muscles . I now have my hubby using the Bee Cool stick for his tired/achy muscles. It has taking me a little bit to get use to the dry lotion but it is great to carry in your purse or in your vehicle. I also use the lip balm and really like it. MOS products is the perfect gift for any occasion , male or female. I encourage you to support independent small business owners 🙂

We live in North Carolina, and cannot spend even ten minutes outside without him receiving several mosquito bites. I was hopeful that the Bug Lotion would protect my son from the mosquitoes, while not further damaging his skin. Sadly, it has not worked for us. No matter how thickly I apply the lotion, he continues to be bitten. And I haven't noticed any improvement in his eczema over other lotions.
However, the customer service was great!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I received bee silk and a natural lip balm as a freebie gift for a convention I attended. They were MARVELOUS!! They Lasted for a very long time and moisturized my lips and skin for quite a while as well! I hadn’t had a lip balm I really liked and after trying MadeOn’s lip balm I was hooked! It is by far the best lip balm I’ve used. It was more expensive than I could really spend for a lip balm but it worked so well and the quality was so much better that I feel it’s totally worth it!<//text>

Amazing products!! Love how easy to use, easy to carry when travel due to packaging. The body hard lotion is truly helping my skin recover. No messy lotion that has to soak in. Also the Bee Cool for muscle aches is miraculous!!  I didn't believe it would help us, but magically the pain is suddenly gone.<//Text>

I just ordered the tinted lip balm in French plum - it feels, smells, looks amazing!  Great color.  Last night I went out for a drink with a fellow mom who had no time to put on makeup as she put her kids to bed and rushed out the door.  I let her borrow this - and she said it feels lovely! And instantly she looked like she had makeup on.  I also tried the avocado goat milk facial bar - and my skin looked radiant and hydrated after one use.  Also love this is a small family run business, and we should do all we can to support that these days!  Especially when their products and customer service are so high quality. Five stars!< /review>

<Text>This is amazing! I love the company’s stance and how they strive to use simple and effective ingredients. They try to use recyclable/reusable packaging as well which is excellent! The products themselves also work very well for my dry skin and the effects after use last longer than other conventional and organic lotions I’ve used. The owner, Renee, personally contacted me after I left a review on their website and after I submitted a photo to her for the website, she gave me some extra rewards points to redeem on my next order. How sweet!! She did not have to do that. I will 1000% order from them again and support a small business!

They did nothing for me but float over my skin.  As I'm aging, I have noticed some drier areas on my skin.  I finally tried some MadeOn products and am now hooked!  I love the Bee Silk. Not only does it help my skin feel nourished but there's no oily substance floating on top of my skin. The Foot Rub has me feeling ecstatic!  I live in Florida and shoes are frequently optional so my feet have some hardened areas.  After two weeks of using the Foot Rub I am feeling so much progress in the softening of my big toes and heels! Oh and the Bee Cool is a miracle worker. I have to add that I feel so good about buying products from someone who gives you the recipes for those same products.  I truly feel that Renee cares more about helping people than over-selling products. I can't wait to try more items!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I got the "Summer Selection Package in Green Burlap bag" that is a great sampler packet. We have tried everything except the rash cream since we have not needed to use it yet. I did do a patch test to make sure there would be no reaction, which there was not & the rash cream feels nice. We are pleased with the variety selection that fits great in the green burlap bag provided. Keep making great skin care products - we need them.</Text>< Pics>

<review>Renee at MadeOn Skin Care is a dream with which to work. We have serious allergies to commercially prepared products and Renee asked specific questions to determine which products might be appropriate. Within three days of ordering, I had product in hand to try. And, best of all, I received a follow up email asking about the allergic response. Excellent customer service AND product. Thanks Renee!</review><date>1557580237996< /date></record></dataset><record>

I received the foot rub and bee silk.  I have really enjoyed both.  The foot rub is great at softening skin and the smell is calming. I have used the bee silk on my hands and wrist and it's worked great at soothing very skin without being greasy. They both will be ready for travel in their convenient tube sizes. Thank you!<//review>

<Text>I just started using the MadeOn Bee Silk lotion bar about a week ago. I love how easy it is to use, and how quickly the lotion is absorbed into my skin. It isn’t greasy at all - just smooth. I appreciate that it is unscented, because sometimes I just don’t want to smell anything on my hands! It’s often difficult to find unscented lotions, and even more difficult to find ones that WORK.
I purchased the pocket sized lotion bar, which leads to the reason (the ONLY reason) I gave this product 4 stars rather than 5: the tin, although adorable, is VERY difficult to open. The top and bottom portions are the same size, so there isn’t much room to grip the top to separate it from the bottom. The tin “snaps” shut, which makes it even harder to open. I would assume the full sized bar’s tin is easier to open because the whole thing is bigger. This is what I would suggest people purchase, rather than the pocket sized.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I love Made On hard lotions, lip balms, junior and soaps! They come in a variety of applications: sticks, balms (regular/tinted) and bars. Perfect for travel, work, kitchen, babies rash area, etc. We keep travel size lotion bars in the cars and my husband keeps one in his desk at work. His favorite lip balm is Vanilla Dust and mine is Mocha. Always look forward to fall and Christmas scents in soaps and lotions. Great products! Thank you, Renee.</Review>

MadeOn lotion bars are excellent for dry skin, during the winter I use mine every day. Also love Renee's lip balms. Most products have less than five ingredients which I love that I can pronounce and know what they all are.  Thanks Renee for such great products!< /text>

<Review>This is one small business website I continue to order from. The business owner Renee, is very sweet, knowledgeable and shares a lot of interesting and helpful information about her product range. The products are all natural, made fresh with a small list of all natural ingredients. They run some great promotions too! The soap they have to offer is wonderful, I've tried many varieties. There are often seasonal offerings of special limited products in various natural scents, and some gift sets from time to time. There are also kits, supplies and information if you're interested in trying to make some of your own similar body care products. My favorite product is the Bee Cool Stick, similar to tiger balm, etc. It's convenient to carry with you, and great for aches, pains, headaches, sinus pressure (don't put near your eyes though). I highly recommend her products! Go check out MadeOn Skin Care!</Review>< Rate>

The hard lotion is exactly what I have been looking for but I didn't know it was actually available! This is a great discovery. The bar is so convenient. I'm constantly washing my hands at work. My hands feel great after putting the lotion on. No greasiness. No waiting for it to "dry" if you use too much of the traditional lotion. No big bottle taking up space on the counter top. This is everyone's Christmas present this year!<//review>

I'm very happy with their lotion bars and sticks and lip balms. They are made of good things that work without a bunch of stuff that you don't need. Highly recommended!< /text>< rate>

<Text>This is one small business website I continue to order from. The business owner Renee, is very sweet, knowledgeable and shares a lot of interesting and helpful information about her product range. The products are all natural, made fresh with a small list of all natural ingredients. They run some great promotions too! The soap they have to offer is wonderful, I've tried many varieties. There are often seasonal offerings of special limited products in various natural scents, and some gift sets from time to time. There are also kits, supplies and information if you're interested in trying to make some of your own similar body care products. My favorite product is the Bee Cool Stick, similar to tiger balm, etc. It's convenient to carry with you, and great for aches, pains, headaches, sinus pressure (don't put near your eyes though). I highly recommend her products! Go check out MadeOn Skin Care!</Text><user_id>107044367722146677150< /user_id><gmapID>0x54d2c8b24bf33fb3:0x708201bfac8ca454< /gmapID>< username>

I love the lotion bars, any scent.  My finger tips crack and it feels so good to scrape a little on those cracks to help them feel better and heal.  They are also great for dry skin. I keep a small tin lotion bar with me all the time.  I've given them as gifts and I get repeated thank yous and they tell me how much they love them also!</Text>

Excellent customer service and quality products. I’m always trying out new products but MadeOn is a company that I keep coming back to. My family and I have used their soap, bee silk and junior, the rash cream and lip balm/tints. Simple, clean, and effective.</review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>I purchased lip balms online and they are the best lip balms! I like them because they are waxy, like a Chapstick would be. I've tried other natural lip balms and they always seem like they have more oils, which make them feel slicker and wear off much faster . I ordered the plain lip balms and the chocolate ones. The chocolate lip balms smell wonderful, like a Tootsie Roll! When I made my purchase, I was notified and I received my order in a timely manner. I am looking forward to making another purchase from MadeOn in the near future.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Such great products! The BeeSilk Junior works well on my kids’ eczema- especially in the dry winter weather! The Simply Shea is perfect for my combination sensitive face and the lip balms are a million times better than my previous favorite- the famous yellow tubes. I have been purchasing from MadeOn for several years and trust their products implicitly. Aside from the products, the site is easy to navigate and item descriptions are very clearly written. The customer service is prompt and extremely helpful. I highly recommend them!</review>

<review>I LOVE MadeOn Skin Care & the owner Renee! Winters can be harsh here in Maine, but since I switched over to all of their products a few years ago, there has not been one cracked finger, heel or lip to be found!! There are several hard lotion bars throughout my home & purse at all times, and many lip balms as well. Their soaps are also so wonderful!!!! I wouldn't ever use anything else. Never any chemicals or fake scents! Renee always goes above and beyond in the customer service department. I really enjoy how much effort she puts in to listening to her customers and creating new products to meet their needs. I am a MadeOn customer for life!!!!!!</review><pictures>None</pictures>< user_id>

I love their soap! It smells wonderful and cleans so well. I also am in love with the peppermint lip balm. It is great and smells so good. And last, but not least, is the Bee Cool sore muscle rub. It is a miracle worker. It works great when I’m sore after a workout. And I gave one to a friend that has fibromyalgia and she loves it for her sore areas.  There’s so much to choose from and the products are really well made. You can’t go wrong!< /review>

I was given a bar of the original Bee Silk last year right as we cam into winter, and it was a life saver! I haven't needed it in the warm weather, but my dry, scaly, cracking winter skin was so soothed by this lotion. I had given up on a lotion that would work and just put up with it, so I was pleasantly amazed to find this! I put it on right before bed and when I know I won't be washing my hands for a while, and it protects my poor hands from the bitter winter elements.<//text>

I randomly ordered a small tin of Second Life a couple of years ago. I am a senior bleached blond who started turning gray in my teens.  Those frizzy little hairs on my sideburns and up my hairline have been my cross  to bear on what is otherwise a gorgeous head of hair. Second Life is the ONLY product that tames them into 'normal' hair. I blow dry my hair, then apply a very small amount rubbed into my fingers then use my curling iron.  I also do the same on any frizzy ends.  Use just a little...this small tin has lasted me over three years! I Promise you'll be happy with the results!  I was so glad MadeOn Skin Care was still in business when it came time to reorder.  Now I'm going to try their scent free soaps for eczema!</Text>

I will never go another winter without Bee Silk lotion bars and Bee Silk Junior!  For years I tried every lotion and even had to carry bandaids around in my pockets because of all the bleeding cuts I had on my hands.      With Bee Silk, my hands are crack free and now I carry around in my pocket a MadeOn lip balm instead!!  =)  I LOVE this company!< /text>

<Review>My skin isn't as elastic as it used to be (happens when you get to be in your late 60's), so use Bee Silk Junior on my body and Bee Silk Lotion Bar on my hands and feet.  This winter my body has thrived using these.  No more dry flaky skin!</Review>< Pictures>

Bee Silk hard lotion bars completely healed my 8 year old sons sore red, cracked and bleeding knuckles within 1 week of him using it every day. He applies it himself and brings his pocket bar with him to school in his pencil case so he can use it when his hands feel dry. We use it on his feet too which used to be very dry and uncomfortable for him. I am very happy to be able to stop using steroid based creams and with hard lotion we don't have to keep reapplying lotion as often.< /text>

Ordered lotion sticks and a Pepperimint lip balm. Order came quickly. At first I thought it was kinda strange , a lotion stick. But I started using it .And found that I liked it. Use it as spot treatment on dry hands or elbows. It fits in my purse just perfect, as it is just about the size of a lipstick. I took the little bottle of lotion out. The bottle of lotion was small, but still bulky.. The lotion stick is even smaller. Love the healing benefits.Thanks MadeOn, I'll be back and I recommend these products for anyone. Oh, and the Pepperimint lip balm is so cool and refreshing on my lips.< /review>< time>

We love the Beesilk regular and pocket bars. Both my girls (4 and 5) get dry skin periodically in the winter, but my oldest daughter really struggles with it. The skin on her hands would frequently crack and bleed until we incorporated their Beesilk bars into their nightly routine. It has been such a blessing to have a product that works so well and that they enjoy using.<//text>

I’m never without Beesilk or Beesilk Jr. My husband picks at dry skin on his hands and this lotion helps him out a lot. He makes sure he always has some in his truck and in my car. I use it for dry patches on my face and it makes a big difference, so we also keep some in our bathroom and one in my purse. Excellent stuff!< /text>

I'm a nurse, so my hands take a beating every day between all the pairs of disposable gloves I have to wear and the constant use of strong anti-bacterial soaps and gels. I use the hard lotion bar every night when I go to bed - if I miss a day, my hands start to evidence dry, "tight", and peeling skin between my fingers by the end of my next shift. And the Bee Cool!!!! THE BEST for back pain!!! I've tried 3 other "name brand" products (both natural and over the counter creams and lotions), and none of them come close to the relief offered by the Bee Cool stick! I keep one at home and one in my work bag, since I do a fair amount of bending throughout the day and want to have one handy if my back starts feeling aggravated.

I also want to give a shout out to Renee and the team for their customer service skills. I had a problem with my account and ordering on the website platform, and Renee responded to my inquiry within a few hours with help and some alternative solutions if the first-line fix failed. Great products and a great team - MadeOn is an all-around win for your skin!</Text>

<username>Jeanette L Wilson</username><text>I LOVE MadeOn Skin Care products! They are made of pure, healthy ingredients and are of superb quality! The products are reasonably priced and their customer service is unsurpassed. I can’t speak highly enough about the Simply Shea Facial Emolient with rosehip seed oil. My face was dry, flaky and overly sensitive to everything. After 3 days of using Simply Shea the dryness was replaced with a very soft, well-hydrated, dewy complexion. My husband has been using it on his hands the last two days and it has healed his dry, red, irritated skin. I can’t thank you enough Renee for making your products available to us!<//text>< user>

<text>I have been very impressed with the quality of MadeOn's products (soaps, various flavored lip balms, Shea butter, the Bee Silk stick, and Bee Cool are some of my favorites).  They keep my skin feeling young and healthy.  I've given many of their products as gifts, and so many times the people I've given them to have come back to me telling me what a great product it was - especially their Peppermint lip balm and AuChocolat lotion bars! I have had friends with eczema tell me it helped their skin, and a lady at my church who is in her 80's tell me how the lotion bar helped her dry skin - and she had tried many other products before, none of which helped.  Their customer service is professional, efficient, and yet very personable and informative.  I don't order on-line for many things, but for this company I certainly will!<//text>< Pictures>

We've been using Beesilk Jr. for over a year...it has healed my little guy's eczema (along with diet changes). We just purchased this mini size and its perfect for the car and/or his backpack. Its a favorite!  Actually, I haven't found a Madeon product we don't love yet!!! And the customer service is the BEST!!!<//Review>

Bee Cool!!!!
This product has helped reduce my headaches caused by tension in my neck and shoulders. At the first hint of soreness, I apply and have found relief over and over again! In fact, I ran out last week and noticed my headaches returning...definitely won't run out again!!!< /Text>

<user_name>Robin</user_name><text>Excellent products for everyone. She had a softer salve (Beesilk Jr) for my sensitive skin, a balm for rashes/irritated skin, great lip balms (I love the tingling peppermint), and the Beesilk lotion bar won over my whole family! The lotion bars come in a nice tin to carry in pocket or purse. The best part is the ingredients are so few & simple I don't have to worry about allergies or all those toxins. It just good, wholesome skincare THAT WORKS!

I have spent too much on lotions only to find they don't work. Try it, you'll see!👍😉</text>< Resp>

We love Renee’s beesilk to ease the eczema irritation and it disappears within a few applications (3 kids, multiple places). I love her peppermint chapstick and junior beesilk for chapped hands and feet. Renee can also help you customize your order and give you gift ideas. Wish we had more than 5 stars to choose from!< /review>

Madeon lotions have been my favorite for several years now. And as my girls grew up, they also loved them as well. Renee, the owner of Madeon is a wonderful person as well. She’s so quick to answer any questions; she’s very knowledgeable in every aspects of her products she creates and she truly cares about her customers. Renee creates her products with love and I always feel it when I use them.  After trying her lotions, I can’t use any other brand. None of them satisfies me as Madeon. Thank you for creating such a product, Renee.</Review>

<time>1523125181990< /time><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I found the MadeOn Skin Care website a couple years ago through the Wellness Mama blog. I was looking for natural skincare without chemicals or so many ingredients that I have no idea what my skin won’t tolerate. I have always had sensitive skin and have had ezcema on my legs on and off for over ten years and their products have helped clear it up for good. I used to wake up in the middle of the night scratching my legs in my sleep till the patches were bleeding. I even tried over the counter and prescription steroid creams that never even had any effect. I had several spots the size of my palm on both legs and now only one spot that is less than a quarter that size on one leg that comes and goes. If I was more consistent in applying the products by MadeOn I’m sure it would go away for good too. During the warmer weather it doesn’t bother me so much so I forget. I’ve also had bad reactions to antibiotics and cold winter weather (and the dry heat in the home that goes with it). These issues caused ezcema to appear on the tops of my hands and fingers. Sometimes it was so bad my knuckles would become swollen and painful to move my hands at all. MadeOn products helped me survive these issues and healed my hands quickly! There isn’t any bad choices when it comes to their products but these are my favorites, the Au Chocolat lotion bar, the whipped Shea Butter in a jar, and the goat milk soap with calendula. The Au Chocolat is easy to apply and it feels like it leaves a protective layer on the skin but doesn’t feel messy or have that cold wet lotion feeling. It smells great too because of the cocoa butter in it. Love that there are very few and natural ingredients in these products. I tried my hand at making something like it (before I found MadeOn) but what I made doesn’t compare in any way, lol. Even their flip top metal containers for the lotion bars are the best (they are like an Altoid mint container). Easy to open but also stay closed. They even make pocket sized ones too! I keep one in my pocket at work all winter long or during those antibiotics induced episodes. I’ve also given those pocket sized ones away to coworkers and friends who want to try the product and to family as stocking stuffers. This stuff doesn’t just wash off like lotion would when you wash your hands too. Of course you could wash it off but if you don’t coat your hands in soap and rub it away it has staying power. The whipped face emollient Shea Butter is so smooth and soft and rich, I use it for my face occasionally but I absolutely would have not survived the antibiotic reaction without it. The tops of my hands from fingertip to wrist were covered in a red bumpy rash that would get hot and crack and burn and occasional even bleed. I used it between the Au Chocolat and especially at night. I would slather a decent amount onto the affected area and put on cotton gloves. I’ve done this for super soft feet too, putting it on under socks before bed. I’m sure if you have any of the issues I’ve had or even just dry skin or occasionally dry skin MadeOn products will help much much better than a regular lotion. One last note, I never used lotion growing up, my sensitive and combination/mostly oily skin wouldn’t tolerate it so that habit has not been an easy one for me to create. MadeOn products are much more convenient to use in that aspect too. After I shower I put it on where needed when I put on my deodorant.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Had the most incredible experience today.
Tom greeted me with a smile and a friendly hello. First thing I noticed was how clean and organized the store was. Pricing was clearly marked and mattresses were arranged by brand and displayed neatly.
I explained to Tom how my boyfriend and I are home with 5 kids, and our old sleep number bed was not working for either of us. I went on to list ours must haves for a new mattress.. me with needing something supportive but plush, and him something that would keep him cool at night. Tom was able to find a perfect mattress for us, and made some other recommendations for add ons. (Like the waterproof mattress topper in case my potty training toddler sleeps over in our bed one night)
We were able to get some really great discounts due to my boyfriends military service, and Tom found the mattress I wanted at 50% from their warehouse. Walked out after my purchase with over $1,600 in savings and I am over the moon happy.
My biggest take away was the impeccable customer service, so thankful for Tom who fielded all of my questions and budget concerns.
Would recommend this place to anyone.
Make sure to tell Tom Betsy and Sean say thanks a million!<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I had inadvertently overpaid cash for a mattress I had purchased for a friend (the bills we're stuck together). They called me the next day to let me know and returned the money. It's great to know people in this world still have integrity and strong character. Go here if you need anything. They will keep you in budget and care about your satisfaction. It may be a small store, but the staff makes up for it in spades. They are simply good people.< /Review>< Response>

My first time visiting this store left me with a great impression of true customer service.  I was greeted by Tom with a smile and a genuine desire to make we feel welcomed and left with all the information I needed to make an informed decision.  I called back to make a purchase and am very happy to write a positive review.  From start to finish, delivery and installation, I was very pleased with the outcome.  I didn't expect such immediate results, considering the existing pandemic.    I would definitely recommend this store to those interested in improving their sleep time experience.  Great job all around.  Thank you, Mattress Firm Santee West!<//text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><review>Despite walking into the store 5 minutes before closing, the lady I spoke to (Janet) was extremely helpful and sincere. She let my wife and I test different beds and gave us recommendations within our budget. We decided to go with the Sleepy's 12" memory foam king mattress and last night was hands-down the best sleep we've had in years. I work between 50-60 hours a week on a computer and this bed is exactly what I've been looking for to help relieve my back and shoulder pain.

This was easily the best (and least stressful) experience I've had at a mattress store. To anyone reading this - I strongly recommend you check out this location. You won't be disappointed!</review></record>

Tom was SOOOOO helpful and made everything so easy, he saved me a trip to the store by emailing a pay link which was such a time saver.

This was probably the best mattress shopping experience I’ve ever had. Definitely ask for Tom when you go in!</Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

After buying a mattress at Costco and sleeping on it for one rough night.... we went looking for a mattress gel topper. When we arrived at the store, Tom was there to greet us and help us decide on a topper. He let us shop around, and try out some other mattresses. He was so helpful and kind, we ended up purchasing a new mattress instead of a topper, and got a great deal!! We truly appreciate the help!!<//Text>

<text>After realizing my lumpy, super old mattress was in desperate need of replacing, I went to the Santee Mattress Firm store on my way home from work, anticipating to walk into a situation with a pushy salesman trying to sell me a mattress. I researched a ton and was set on a Purple mattress, but wasn't sure which type so I decided to go into a store to test them out. Right when I walked in, Thomas was warm and welcoming and directed me to the Purple mattresses. He never once pushed or tried to oversell...he was just pleasant, super knowledgeable, and gave me enough information to make an informed decision on my new mattress. I was pleasantly surprised at the excellent customer service provided by Thomas, and I would absolutely recommend anyone buy a mattress from him.

On the day my mattress was delivered, I received a text with a window of time that I could expect my mattress. Then, I received an email letting me know the driver will arrive within 10 minutes. Marco and Jesus showed up right on time, we’re friendly and efficient. My new mattress was set up within 10 minutes and they even got rid of my old mattress. I was very impressed with my whole experience with Mattress Firm!<//text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1615232949214, 'text': "Thanks so much for the review, Kerri Ewing!

<Review>I've never been in love with a bed before! Feeling like Goldie locks that has found the perfect fit. It's a different feel with gel crate & was hesitate at 1st. But husband & I have not woken up with any pain. We're side, stomach & sometimes back sleepers who likes a bit of firm. This bed gives support where we need it, mostly hips and shoulders, yet so comfy every where else. Oddly enough too, it kinda gives you a bounce when getting out of bed. There's days I go to bed early,like 6pm (we use to be night owls going to bed at midnight) just cause I'm so darn comfortable! Plus, being pregnant, this has been my most favorite place to hang out now. It's slightly cool, too cool for my liking but my husband said it could be cooler. So his body temp hasn't changed much (although, could be the sheets) but without my heating blanket, this bed feels ice cold to me. I AM IN LOVE WITH PURPLE! Plus Mattress Firm Santee, Ca was so helpful. I read the bad reviews but we've never had a problem, this is our 2nd mattress purchase, we upgraded to a King. The employees were very helpful and insightful, process and set up is easy.<//Review>< pictures>

It was nice to walk in and get that one on one service. She was so patient while we tried and retried every bed. It was a special day for my daughter and that is what mattered.< /review>

<Text>We started at Jeromes Dream shop and upon walking in the door we were attacked by a woman that was desperate for a commission. It was 90 seconds later that I walked out the door. I decided to stop in this place and when we walked in we were greeted by a very nice man that said he would help us in just a bit and to go ahead and look around. I can’t explain how refreshing it is to go to a store and receive customer service. So it  turns out that Thomas Rinear and Teissa Barlina at Mattress Firm were the two people that helped us today, they were amazing. They actually listened and let us proceed at our pace. These two people have a fantastic dynamic together and it comes through to the customer in the form of team work. We are very super satisfied with our purchase and highly recommend that you go see these people. Customer service at its finest and the prices were great too. I will tell everybody I know to go here because of the service I received! Thanks guys :)< /Text>< pictures>

< review>
We had been thinking about a new bed for a while and decided to stop by and see if my husband could find one that he felt comfortable on.  Right away we met Tom and he was an absolute pleasure to speak with and once he knew what our needs were he showed us our different options and told us the specifics of each mattress, as well as pillows. After finding one we liked we briefly did the numbers and we were set!!  He really took care of my husband and I and listened to what we needed as well as the savings he got us.  Tom, we are so happy to have met you and should we need anything in the future when it comes to our sleeping needs, you will be our first call!  24 hours later, here we are relaxing, watching movies on our new tempurpedic bed with adjustable base!  Here’s to better nights full of comfortable rest!</review>

<Text>Overall good experience.
I only came in because they had the Purple advertisement in the window. Otherwise I was going to buy it online.  They did price match what Purple was selling it for online. The skinny dude I dealt with was calm and easy going.  If you live in a home where the bedrooms are upstairs and you have a Cal-King/King bed, defiantly get the full service delivery and set up.  Otherwise you could get away with not paying for the extra if you have a 1 story home. But the CK/K mattresses are heave and huge. It's worth the price. The only negative is beware of the weighted blankets they sell and ask the right questions. The dude sold me a blanket that I thought was a Purple blanket, but it wasn't.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>Worked with Matt in-store and online to purchase new box spring for King size mattress. My spouse has a chronic illness and Matt was very knowledgeable and explained all the options available in-store as well as suggesting some motion controlled platforms. I was able to purchase online via links Matt set up for me via text and email. Overall was easy and convenient. Thanks for your assistance and expertise Matt!

I had a general idea of what I wanted, going in today; however, Teissa was very helpful bringing me to three different mattress options, at three different brands and price points, and helping me pick the best option for me. She was polite and professional, and was not pushy at all, in expecting me to buy/add-on, etc., and overall her explanations of what I was getting were spot on, and the experience was very positive.<//Text>

Candace was very helpful! I told her my needs and what I was looking for in a new bed. I’ve been dealing with back pain for a couple years and I also sleep better in a cool temp bed. She helped me narrow down the best sleeping arrangement for me, plus with their Labor Day weekend sale I got so much more at a great price. Candace was also very inclusive of my 10 year old son who was with me, which was very sweet and added the “cherry on top” of a great shopping experience. Thank you Candace and Mattress Firm!</review>

<text>My husband and I went in expecting to buy a mattress so we can buy a mattress and get get free adjustable base. I have been wanting/ needing an adjustable base for years due to my bad back, sleep apnea, and reflux. Turns out the free bases are very basic so we decided to by an upgraded base instead and keep our mattress. We have to wait 1.5 weeks for delivery but I'm ok with that. We had great customer service provided to us .< /text>< Pictures>

Since we were having trouble with completing a warranty claim online, there were several times we had to go to the store for help.  Each time, we received great customer service from Floyd.  He was helpful, patient, & sincere in working with us to file the claim.< /review>

I want to start off by saying tom or thomas is the best worker i have came across in a very long time. My wife and I spent maybe hour  or longer inside the store. He didnt rush us he didnt try to sell us everything. He was very professional and kind. One complaint i have is that every employee or worker is Not like  tom. We were able to find the perfect match for us and he took care of every need. SometimeS making a big purchase can be nerve racking , but with tom it was easy and he was simply a joy to talk to! Thank you again for the best customer service and the relationship we built! I will recommend him and mattress firm to others without any doubt!< /review>

Just purchased a mattress after working with Candace. We visited several of their competitors and none of their mattresses just nailed it. After two minutes of listening to what we’re looking for, Candace showed us three mattresses that were a dream. She was extremely nice and super patient with us as we tried to narrow down which mattress we loved most. I highly recommend coming in and working with her to find your dream mattress! Candace is a delight, completely transparent about all prices, & not pushy in the slightest. She’s super personable and you won’t regret working with her.</Review>

Wow I am literally blown away by the customer service here my husband and I were looking to buy the purple mattress and we actually ordered it from the purple website but when we came to this store to try out the mattress we actually loved the customer service so much and how they were so willing to go out of there way to help us and make sure we were happy with our purchase we stopped  the order with Purple and purchased it at Mattress FIRM in Santee . Candace literally worked her magic and got us our mattress the same weekend we bought it . And kept it in our budget! She was literally on her way out the door when we got to the store and stayed to help us ! I would not go anywhere else they are patient kind and do ANYTHING to make sure your satisfied. I would and will recommend this specific store to anyone !! This location is the best! Thank you Candace !!!! Thank your Mattress Firm Santee !!< /Review>

When shopping for mattress for our kids who knew there would be so many options. Floyd was so helpful and patient with us. He listened to what we wanted and made sure to stay within our budget. His customer service is above and beyond I would recommend to anyone in the market for a new mattress to go see Floyd.</Review>

Floyd was awesome! We came in with the mattress we had in mind for the Labor Day sale, and he was so straight forward and located the one we were looking for. Let me lay down, I said I loved it, and we bought it then and there! He’s even having it delivered to the Santee store for pick up instead of making me go to Miramar! You’re the best, Floyd, thank you!< /text>

<Text>I went in looking for the cheapest possible mattress but our salesman Floyd was incredibly helpful and helped us determine the mattress we actually needed and that would be comfortable and long lasting. He also helped us with a box spring, bed frame that matched our house, and a credit card to help us pay for it all over time. What a great experience!<//Text>< Pictures>

If you're looking for a mattress, then this is the place. I was helped by Keith, and he's absolutely fantastic. Honest and will get you the best deal in the San Diego area. I wish Google had a 6 star option.</review>

<username>Steve Webb< /username><Date>1534107655091<//Date><Rate>5< /Rate><text>Very pleased with our experience at this store.  Purchased a bed for our motor home from Wesley, who gave us an awesome price, even lower then the sale price.  Got the mattress home and it was too firm.  Called Wesley, expecting a hassle, but not at all.  Went back, Wesley was off and we met Simon.  Fortunately Wesley had left notes on our account about our issues.  Simon found us another mattress, more expensive, but he met the other price.  Gave us a killer deal on delivery too.  Got the mattress a few minutes ago and its perfect!  This is our second bed from this company and what a "no pressure" "excellent" and "no hassell" experience.  Five Stars!!<//text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80dbfd57b992369f:0x588ea756d4f548ed<//Gmap_id></record>

Tommy Chun was very helpful. We found the right mattress within minutes but he helped us circle all the options before we went back to that one so we were confident in our choice. Nice store and our experience was pleasant start to finish. They had good thanksgiving sales as well.<//review>

< review>
I came in a little bit before the 4th of July, yet they already had the sale started. Well, Antoinette helped us out so incredibly much that we were happy that we bought the bed from her. I still intend to get her a Subway gift card as a little thank you. She not only gave me a 10% discount on top of the sale, but made it 15% because I'm a veteran, despite the fact that I didn't have my vet ID on me, and took my word for it. Next, the computer wasn't working, so she took off another $300 to make our transaction an even $2000, which apparently helped the system process it. A friendly shoutout to the manager, Tony, who hooked us up with a free $200 pillow simply because there was some confusion about when our bed was getting delivered.</review>

<review>My whole family's been going here for years religiously, and each time I have a tire problem too far out in the bay where I can't ride on the spare for too long, I'm reminded how great they are. They outperform in price, confidence of technicians, time and friendliness whether compared to a chain or another small operation.

I've even got the tools and skills to change tires in my own garage, but between how fast San Martin Tire is and the price of my own time removing old tires, installing new ones, and properly balancing them, it's not even worth doing myself! I'm local, but I'd still come here to do tire stuff even if I lived in Sunnyvale, Fremont or Hollister.</review>< Gmap_id>

<rating>3</rating><Text>Stopped by for a tire repair, was kinda pricey $30 considering I brought in the bed of the truck and I did not have them reinstall it or the spare. They weren't very busy a did the work right away, but didn't rebalance the tire afterwards even though they removed a weight.

Edit
You told me $35 because I requested a plug patch, but you forgot to tell the technician,who installed a regular patch. When I balked at the price you told me it would be $30, but I do see that you only charged me $25 after checking my reciept. I can see the outline of where the wheel weight was removed so the the tire could be dismounted but it was never put back on and not balanced. FYI i am an ASE master technician.  Not sure how you can justify not balancing a wheel after removing material and then adding a patch, they're not weightless. Also you never quoted me a price to do they repair in the 1st place. Thank you for reaching out to address this but you too should include all the facts</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1597342218620, 'text': "Hi Scott, it was nice talking with you the other morning about your trip to Trinity. When posting a review we need to make sure that you are accurate. As you know, I didn't charge you $30 for the tire repair. I only charged you $25. We normally charge $30 for an LT load range E tires, however since you did bring it off the truck I discounted the repair.  In addition, to help you understand how a tire repair is done on most vehicles, we mark the tire with chalk before we take any weights off the wheel so we know exactly where to put them back on the wheel. This retains the balance of the tire on the wheel. This is how most shops do the repairs. We can certainly balance the wheel after the repair if requested. Thanks again for your business. EDIT: Thanks for your feedback. I also own Autoland in Santa Clara where I have 4 ASE Techs that work for me. If you want to get technical you are correct, the wheel should be balanced and for extra safety a plug patch should also be installed. Unfortunately, most people don't want to pay between $30 and $40 for a tire repair. We've used the same process for many years and never had any customers complain about the balance. Unless of course, we leave one of the weights off.  The employee who did your repair has been talked to and it shouldn't happen again. Thanks again, and please come back to have your wheel balanced at no charge."}<//response><GmapID>0x8091e1b20d69e36f:0xfdf1c25b6cdcec27</GmapID></record>

San Martin Tires gets right down to the point, and gives you what you're looking for without any extra sales pitching, like Jiffy Lube or those other places that shove extras down your throat.

First look appearances, it doesn't look all spit shine and polished up, but the ratings on Google kept me pulling in. Glad I did.

I told them what I want, they quoted me a price and got me in and out in around 30 minutes.  The great part was the price they quoted per tire actually included ALL the extra stuff they do when they sell and mount tires.  (Some places only quote you the tire price... then the extras get tacked on at the register! Ug....  But when I looked at my receipt, there was no extra Ug!)

They back up their work with 3 free tire rotations, (KEEP THAT RECEIPT PEOPLE!!!). Today was a pleasant surprise indeed.<//Review>

Good prices and great service. Always fast tire changes or patches. Very important when you run a service company and people are waiting on your arrival.< /Text>

They worked proficiently as a team and were able to service many customers at the same time expeditiously.  And the price was much more reasonable than I was quoted elsewhere.

<rate>1<//rate><Text>I had a flat and went in to get it patched, they chipped the lip of the wheel, a part on the inner face of the wheel and all around the Lug Nuts. When i confronted the tech who did it he simply said he wasn't responsible, never going back here again. Going to cost more to repair the chips and scratches than what it would've cost to take it to a professional shop.<//Text>< pics>

Hi I just want to comment on how pleased I was when I came to the AT&T store and Eric assisted us he was fantastic I was frustrated before I came and how took the time to listen patiently and  let us know that it's not a problem that's what he's here for and you took care of all of our questions and made me feel way better for being a new AT&T customer and I told him anything needed I will return to his branch office thank you!</Review>

Marvin was excellent. I hate the drive up. He made it worth it.  He was informative and has good customer interaction. I felt I was getting the service I have come to enjoy with AT&T. My mom is getting a new phone and will enjoy watching all her shows. I’ll have peace of mind that she can call the grans whenever she wants. Thanks Marvin.< /text>

Sadly I let myself convinced by a salesman named “will” that adding another line and paying 50% upfront will decrease my bill by $10 and I wouldn’t have to pay full price for the phone. Too good to be true:):):): he stated that it was a promotion that ATT was running. Long story short 30 days later ATT bill went from $217 to $305. I went back to this salesman and he again stated I was not understanding numbers. I called ATT again and even after removing unnecessary fees bill will stay at $260 approx. monthly. That is about $600 yearly.
BE Very cautious “will” is very skilled in punching numbers on his tablet and he is very good at sales, he evens says that he builds his business based on trust, but 30days when actual provider bill comes around is another story; one that unfortunately YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE to retract....:(<//text>< Rate>

I was in a major hurry and thanks to customer service representative by the name of Jasmin Bravo she was able to assist me in a timely manner. She went above and beyond to help me.

Ask for Jasmin should you happen to be in the area. I see her running her own district soon.
Thanks Jasmin.</review>

Adriana assisted me with getting a new iPhone as my old one was pretty outdated and the speaker had stopped working. I was able to get the buy 2 get 1 free deal so I decided to purchase some AirPod Pros.. They work very well and the noise cancellation is great! The Bluetooth distance is way better than the previous ear buds I had been using. It was convenient to be able to put the accessories that I didn’t wanna buy outright on an installment plan. Thanks again!<//Review>

All they did was try to pressure me into getting more services, even asking me repeatedly to text my family members and grandmother to see if o could get services for them under my account. I was there for 2 hours and didn’t lower my bill one solid penny. There’s a difference between upselling and predatory practices and this store needs to find the balance.<//text>< rate>

< review>
After receiving a challenging time over the phone, we came to the corporate store in Hawthorne, CA and were greeted at the door by Bryan G.

After explaining our situation he stated “No problem I have done this before.”  With his patience and assistance my husband and I were able to change 3 different accounts and walk out with a huge smile.

Bryan is the BEST a 20 on the scale of 10!!!!

The employee Jessica here was amazing. I’d give 10 stars if I could! I came in looking for a phone thinking I was going to pay a huge amount, but she was very good at looking for promotions that I was eligible for. She knows tons of information and answered every single question I had. Thank you!!</Review>

I was here yesterday to get my phone transferred with no luck and forgot the cord charger. Luckily, I had the pleasure of coming back into the store today & met Jefferey🌞. He was very patient and willing to help I must say the other phone was quite old BUT, Jeffery was able to help out. I'd like to request that Jeffery be recognized at the next Leadership meeting. Keep up the good work. YOU made my day🌞👍although, I was your first customer you helped me more than you know & I appreciate your professionalism.

Had a great experience and it's all thanks to Marvin!  We made an appt, Marvin saw us right on time and we had about a hundred questions.  He was real patient with us, outlined all the options for the plans and helped us figure out the best phone and the best plan for us.  We are longtime AT&T customers (all the way back to the CIngular days!), but we've found the best way to get answers is to just head to the store.  We've always had good interactions with their staff, but really felt like Marvin needed to be called out for his fantastic customer service, excellent demeaner, and general kindness.  We will continue using this store even though there are closer ones to our house!</Text>

I am extremely satisfied with the assistance provided by Kay. As I approached the store I could see a young lady through the glass walking towards me, But wasn’t exactly sure if she was assisting someone else or what. As I opened the door Kay meet me head on with a attitude of gratitude and such a warm smile through her mask. I arrived requesting an agent to whom I had spoken to over the phone, Kay quickly and unselfishly explained that she could possibly work for another location, but with her honesty and willingness to assist I was sold on closing out the purchase of my new iPhone 6 series watch with her. #ExtremelySatisfied❤️<//Text>

<Name>Viviana Lara< /Name><Review>I went in and was told I was going to wait 10 mins. An hour later I was still waiting I had to get up to ask them to help me out since the manager who had just came back from an hour lunch started helping someone who came in before me. None of the managers or employees approached me to tell me it would be a longer wait. Since I kept seeing employees come in and out of break I figured there will finally be one to help me but none of them helped or bother to update me on the wait time. I was patient but eventually lost my patience with all the waiting when another customer came in and got help immediately score me by a manager! Another manager approached and tried to let me know he or the other manager couldn’t help but I don’t think it s at all ok to have managers sitting around taking a hour lunch to just come back and sit around some more while there’s customers there. It was a very unsatisfactory experience I wouldn’t go back to this location. My problem wasn’t fixed and it literally took less than 10 mins to do what he did to “fix” my problem.< /Review>< gmapID>

The customer service has really changed within this store. My family and I have been going to this location for years, the original employees there were helpful, and we connected with a few of them. Now with the new manager and the employees that we had connected had left, it has changed. My mother went to this location because she was having a problem with her new phone, one of the employees was being condescending, towards her as if it wasn't his problem, she became upset, and the manager just stood to the side leaning against the display that stood at the middle of the store and watched with a small smirk on his face, he didn't not come to us to deescalate the situation, or even tried to help. This wasn't the first time that this has happened where we go because of a problem, and this same manager just stood by and watched. The final straw was when my mother had gone back with this problem, and she went to him for him to her help, he just stood there looked at and said, "Someone will help you, but you can go to this other location, someone there could help you" and just walked away. Is this the example that AT&T wants for their stores?<//Text>

I was assisted by Rose & Daisy.  They helped me return a phone and sold me another. It was quite a process, through no fault of their own. While assisting me both employees had to deal with an aggressive customer. Rose & Daisy conducted themselves with the utmost professionalism and courtesy.

Hello AT&T to whom this may concern,

I have been a loyal customer of AT&T for over 20 years and I have never experienced such horrible customer service until today.

I recently visited your store on Roscrans and Hindry on Tuesday, February 16th attempting to purchase my daughter a new gold or silver iPhone 12.

Brian was my representative and Andrea was the manager over the staff, who was quite rude to me and my family.

Allow me to explain - My partner walked into the AT&T store and asked the representative if they had the gold or silver IPhone 12 in stock (-as Apple product is very popular and color is important to teenagers). The representative then explained that they can not give out that specific information without first having my phone information. Well this request seemed weird and a little aggressive however I complied. In providing Brian with my phone number he consistently entered the wrong number into the system. Pulling up someone’s information named Melinda, I know this because he referred to me as Melinda. I exclaimed in a louder tone my cellular number, at least four times. After the fourth attempt Brain went to the back of the store and retrieved his Manager and explained that we were yelling at him. Interesting that he suddenly felt attacked when just moments earlier he engaged in small talk with us about his manager and her lack of customer service skills. Even explaining how he planned not to follow in her foot steps as she was running customers off.

At this point, the manager returns obviously upset and aggressive and approaches my family with a stern,”IS THERE A PROBLEM”. Now this catches my family off guard as explained above our conversation with Brian was not hostile. My family and I explained that this was horrible customer service and choice to simply depart the store before the situation got worse.

Before leaving the parking lot we called the next closest store on Hawthorne and El Segundo and asked the same question, “Do you have the silver or gold IPhone 12 in stock at your store?”
The representative replied no but we have the blue, at this point my daughter was willing to sacrifice her favorite the color of choice. A simple request for a teenager, one would think? My family and I drove to
store on Hawthorne and El Segundo where a representative named William; was a gracious host and satisfied our needs as a family.

I am deeply disappointed in the service we received today from the AT&T representative and manager on Roscrans and Hindry and I hope that my letter lands into the hands of someone who can provide them with the proper personnel training and maybe even an exchange of my daughters phone to the gold or silver iPhone 12 she originally requested. We should not have to pay for their bad day.<//Text>

<Text>I truly enjoyed my shopping experience thanks to William Sumner. My mother and I visited this location to upgrade our iPhones. William gave us a very detailed and thorough overview of the various plans available. I left the store feeling confident that William signed me up with the best plan available for the price. If you happen to visit this location, please request William because he is the best Sales Representative at this location. Most importantly, he treats every customer with the utmost level of dignity and respect, and he is very patient and thorough. I will return to this location based on my experience with William because he made my mother and I feel extremely welcome from the minute we walked through the door. Overall, he exemplifies professional which is very rare these days.<//Text><gmapID>0x80c2b417911d38bb:0x8f4e172886065359</gmapID><Resp>{'time': 1592436593736, 'text': 'Hello Camille!

I was greeted by Erika when I arrived and even though I was super early for my appointment they were able to see me right away.  Excellent rep named Rose helped with an easy and smooth upgrade to my new phone, helped me with my accessories and had me out of there in no time.  No pressure with extra stuff, I heard some different options but declined them and that was fine, happy to hear them but no pressure to do anything which I appreciated.  Highly recommend this store, they will be my go-to from now on.  Great job!<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2b417911d38bb:0x8f4e172886065359<//Gmap_id></record>

<user_name>Luis Bryant< /user_name><review>Jake was super helpful when I was there a week ago. Was able to bundle all of my services together with a military discount , as well as getting me a free XS promo! Was able to get 20% off 3 accessories . From past experience , this AT&T was really lazy in getting a promotion for me or savings, but management really changed this time of year! Thanks Jake , with the help of JD!<//review><UserId.>100534464341881701369< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Beyond stupid: the limit of number of people in the store is 10 (covid19) that's fine, but 5 of them are the employees! So the result is that 2 of the employees are sitting there playing with their phones, while customers are made to wait outside for 40 minutes !<//text>

I came into wanting to get a new phone for my daughter , it was about almost time to close, felt bad because closing hours, but Jake took us in and we had to be out ASAP due to me having to pick up my kids, Jake found additional discounts to waive my activation fee through AARP as well as getting me a new phone for my daughter as well as a new line for my son for $10 more than what I was currently paying with autopay! Jake was super quick and finished in 15-20 min! Super nice of them to take us in late and maximizing our discounts in that span of time!</Text>

I really appreciate all the help I received from Dannie. He spent 75 minutes to undo the unfinished/lousy job another AT&T rep in another location had done and then do what we had originally asked regarding adding a new number to our multiline family plan. Good job!< /Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Thank you to sales rep Marisa Rivera for my "Pretty Woman" moment in her store.  I wasn't getting any love from Verizon when I was shopping to upgrade my old broken Samsung.  And the repair store didn't have the part to fix it. So I walked right next door and Marisa hooked me up with an iphone.  "Huge mistake (Verizon), HUGE!"  (And thanks Marisa for making it so easy to switch.)</Review>< pictures>

One of the customer service representative, combined my u-verse bill with my cellphone bill, with out my consent, when I came to the store to upgrade my daughter’s cellphone. I did go to the store to resolve it. I was told by the rep, it will be corrected. It wasn’t resolved. I called several times to correct this issue, to no avail. U-verse never properly credited my payment to my cellphone bill, instead send a bill with no payment required for u-verse. Today,  I called both ATT and U-verse to get my payment to be transferred. I hope this issue will be resolved in time. My issue is still pending. With this kind of bad experience, I am thinking not to stay with ATT or U-Verse! I hope corporate pay attention!<//text>

<Text>Went to this location to purchase a new Iphone. There was a short wait, I was about 6 people back, but they had a tv with a basketball game on and some tables and chairs to sit at while u wait. wait time was about 15 min. Darrell who helped me was extremely personable and answered any questions i had. he made the experience a great one. I appreciated the help and walked out with a new phone in less than an hour. would definitely return to this location.<//Text>< user>

My mom is elderly and they have taken advantage of her. Setting up different accounts under her name and charging her for it.She only needs 1 account! She has spent hours trying to get  this cleared up. The manager is the worst and still has not helped. I now need to contact their corporate offices and the Better Business bureau. I attempted to call and no one picks up the phone. We went in the store and it was packed. Not enough employees for the foot traffic. Extremely disappointing and scary as to how many other elderly people they may be hustling to get an account set up for commission or to meet a sales quota.< /Text>

My phone was not working, so I went in to get another phone.
Ari waited on me and was extremely helpful in explaining the different plans and the features of the new phone.
The place was busy, so there was a small wait.   The service that you get makes up for the wait!< /review>

Doesn't AT & T pay attention to any reviews? I've looked up all AT & T stores in a 10 mile radius from me, and they all have terrible reviews.

I have been calling this store for the last half hour and they do not pick up the phone.</text>

<Text>Had a Samsung 8+ I was locked out of, and AT&T was absolutely NO help whatsoever.  Even though I am paying an absorbitant amount to AT&T monthly.  The only way they would unlock the phone was for me to find someone else to take over the phone, then they would unlock the phone for THEM. To top it all off, they sent me on a wild goose chase with outdated information.  They sent me to an authorized Samsung dealer that was Closed up, gone out of business.  To make a long story short, I finally did get the phone unlocked, thank Heaven.  My advice:  never, ever forget any of your email codes associated with any phone  you buy from them.  Because they will NOT help you at all if you're locked out.  Just so you know. #AT&Tiscrap4real.< /Text>< date>

Horrible customer service. Manager sees 3 people waiting, with 2 employees helping others and doesn't offer to assist. 30 mins pass and still the same people waiting to be helped. AT&T really needs to step up their customer service.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Terrible service they were practically racist with me because my English is bad and I do not have the name of the person because I was the only one who did not have his identification (woman, white, and fat) it was my turn with the young man who spoke Spanish and she sent him with another person, then he came to me and my companion and she sent it with two other people which was unfair because they arrived long after us and they did not speak Spanish. It was fair to pay attention to us first, we waited more than an hour and This lady put the young man to attend while she did not do anything ... then he attended us he apologized when it was not his fault.

(Original)
Pésimo servicio prácticamente fueron racistas conmigo por que mi inglés es malo y no tengo el nombre de la persona porque era la única que  no tenía su identificación (mujer, blanca, y gorda) era mi turno con el joven que hablaba español y ella lo mando con otra persona, luego el venía hacia mi Y mi acompañante y ella lo mando con otras dos personas cosa que se me hizo injusto porque ellos llegaron mucho después que nosotros y tampoco hablaban español era justo que nos prestarán atención primero esperamos más de una hora y esta señora ponía al joven a atender mientras ella no hacia nada... luego el nos atendió se disculpó cuando no era su culpa.</review>

Absolutely the best car buying experience I've ever had. Our salesperson Garrett took the time to show us and test drive a few vehicles. He was professional courteous and very patient and helped us find our brand new 2021Toyota Corolla Apex. Ramiro in financing was also very helpful and patient as well. I just want to say thank you to Claremont Toyota and all their staff for a great car buying experience. My wife and I love our new 2021 Toyota Corolla apex.</Review>

I bought a used 2014 Toyota sienna at premium cost a month ago. The temporary  tag is expired and I still haven't received my paper registration.  When I call multiple times  and hold multiple times. The lady I finally talked to asked me a few questions and then promptly said done you can put the tag on the car.  Which is the worst advice  seeing as how its illegal to put a tag on a car without a paper registration.... folks will say anything to get you to go away. Even advising  someone to break the law... not impressed  at all ...</Review>

< review>
Bought a (minimally) used 2019 Corolla Hatchback SE recently from Claremont Toyota.
Overall, we are very pleased with our new ride and the purchase experience we had through the dealer. Brian did a great job of keeping in contact in contact with us prior to us coming down. We came from 2hrs away. Everything was straight forward except for the walk around. We did get the opportunity to walk around and look at the car, sit in it and drive it. I just wish they’d shown us the minor cosmetic damage there was on the car. Instead…. We ended up finding when we got home. Not a dealbreaker, I just think absolutely clarity should be at the forefront of a dealership’s core characteristics. What we bought was a “Certified Used Car”, which means it went through an in-depth review process before resale. This leads me to the conclusion that the dealer absolutely knew about the cosmetic damage, yet negated to tell us during the sale. Anyways, when u tally everything up… I’d still recommend Claremont Toyota. The beat the heck out of our local Toyota dealer for sure. Try ‘em out… just do a more thorough walk-around than we did.< /review>

<review>They made car shopping so easy, best experience I have ever had. I purchased a Camry which is now my 3rd bought car and no dealer has helped me as well as Claremont Toyota, I have to give it up to Mickey, he helped me find the perfect car and had the best hospitality and was very helpful with the different options I could go with in regards to getting the car. Then afterwards, I was helped by Joseph to close out the deal and he made the process so easy was super super easy. I have had to wait 4-8 hours at other dealers. I was out of there in within 3 hours I was home with a brand new car!!! I would recommend Mickey to everyone of my friends and Family and hope they are assisted by Joseph afterwards. Claremont Toyota is the place to be!!!</review>< pictures>

<Text>Went for an oil change, which is suppose to be free(included when the vehicle was purchased). They then forced me to pay for other services, inorder to get my oil change. Refused to change the oil without inspecting wind shield wipers, switching around the wheels, etc, for like 70 dollars. Said something about it being mandatory for them to do every 5k miles, and that I had to do it, or not have the oil changed.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

I got a new Camry this past weekend of 1/6/21 and it has been up to date the best car buying experience i have had. Diego and Pedro were the gentleman that helped me out and were very curious and respectful. Not pushy at all like other car salesman I have encountered in the past. I came with my brother in law the next day and he bought a car as well. That's how I am, if a business treats me well and gives me the best deal possible I myself will bring them business and I plan on bringing my parents back since they are in the market to buy a new car. Love my Camry , first Toyota I have ever owned and I'm not going back. Thank you Claremont Toyota. You take care of me and I will keep on bringing you guys clients!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<review>I don't normally go to dealerships to shop for a car, so I was hesitant to go. I didn't want to get stuck talking to some pushy salesman. Garrett Woolford helped me last weekend. I was looking for a used Toyota Highlander and after a quick chat, he knew that they didn't have what I was looking for. He still continued to talk to us for probably a good 45min or so teaching us about the highlander and letting me ask ALL of the questions. He was super helpful and intelligent! I keep checking back on the site to see if they have what I need because I'd like to buy a car from him. Crossing my fingers!<//review>< pics>

<text>This dealership is HORRIBLE!!  I recently test drive the perfect 4 Runner of my choice....I was ready to buy then the salesman and Manager said it was 5,000 above MRSP I asked why I was told “because we can. It’s due to supply and demand & if I want the pro it’s additional $15,000” I said I get nothing of value for the Mark up? They said “NO but it’s ok people will do it” I am a healthcare provider I have seen a lot during all the craziness in the world BUT this was horrible and VERY DISAPPOINTING!

If I could give 10 stars I would. That’s how good my experience was.

Pablo and Momo are the best! Come here and don’t go anywhere else, TRUST ME!

This was my first time leasing. I’ve actually gone to three dealerships before coming here and I’m telling you the customer service was “immaculate” and supreme!

The other Toyota dealerships were awkward and unfriendly. They didn’t have your best interest at heart while everyone at Claremont Toyota made you feel like family!

We got here late like at 8:30pm and Pablo and Momo took their time with us and made a suggestion I didn’t think I would like (black Camry with red interior). Momo promised me that I would love it and I’m not capping (not lying) as soon as I drove it, I felt so happy with the car and still do!

I’m a customer for life. Thank you Momo and Pablo and everyone else at Claremont Toyota!

If you’re looking at different dealerships, I can tell you confidently to come to this one first and you won’t want to go anywhere else.<//review>

<text>Thank you Prosper & Luis for helping me purchase my dream car. I had originally stopped by last night and Prosper greeted me right away. I wasn't 100% sure if I was ready to commit, so I left.

Prosper reached out to me today and told me he wanted to work something out. Luis and I discussed numbers and we were able to meet in the middle. With there help, I got an early Christmas gift which is my dream car ; 2021 Camry XSE V6, Pearl White.

Thank you again Prosper and Luis for my early Christmas gift 🎄. I can't wait to be on the road! Also, thank you Richard from financing for making it an easy, welcoming, and fun experience.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Went to purchase a vehicle, negotiated a price or were trying to negotiate a price with the salesman who was actually very pleasant. He left and came back with a supervisor, I think his name may have been LUIS who sat down and told my husband and I that both cars we were interested in now had mark ups. A Toyota RAV4 hybrid had price on window for 32000 and this supervisor lets us know that since this is a hot car they are marking it up 2000 so the original price is not what the sale price is , new price is 34k. He then moves on to the Toyota Venza (loved this car, test drove it) and says although the sticker price on the window says 32400 he is now marking it up 5000. When I asked why that was not posted on the sheet printed on the window he says they are working on printing that out as we speak and the one on the window is wrong. He says he can strike us a deal and sell it to us with only a 3000 mark up to help close the deal!!! My husband and I were completely confused. We had already ran numbers with the sticker price, payment and down payment with the sales person based on the sheet on the window dealer asking price. I would not recommend this place. We wasted time and I’m so glad we did not authorize them to run our credit until we had a verbal final price. It would have dinged my credit and just to be surprised that they have hidden mark ups from 2000 to 5000 which were not advertised. If advertised I would have not given the cars a second look and wasted my time. Salesman Fabrizio was completely professional and pleasant but they manager/supervisor(not sure) Luis was unprofessional , rude and ruined a sale for his salesman.</text>< Pictures>

<review>Honesty...integrity  describe this great American family that ended up on the front page of the Times for "doing-the-right-thing...for us" (for a change!)
The story goes...Toyota had a "re-call" but didn't fix the problem.
The Hogan Family stood-up to the giant and said basically..."until you ACTUALLY do correct the problem (that is hurting our customers) we aren't selling any more!"
Ouch! Oh Baby...that can hurt...Claremont Toyota is a leading sales point for Toyota's record breaking sales!
In today's world when profit seems to replace morals...it's  a blessing to see this company stand up for their customers.
The Hogans have always cared for their community...for real...(not just for publicity). They are heavily vested in giving to charities locally.
Care is their cornerstone of success! Real care, in this case may cost them money but that isn't what motivated their decision to stand-up for what's best for us. Integrity!
A huge THANK YOU!
On my top 10 Favorite American Companies

I would most definitely recommend Claremont Of Toyota to family and friends. The customer service was excellent and both the Sales Agent Henry and finance manager Richard took the time to explain in details the process and all the details of the car and financing. Continue song the awesome job!!<//Text>

Neither of these scenarios were true of my experience at Claremont Toyota. Ishmael and Luis (“Turbo”)-sales, Jonathan-finance, listened to my questions and worked with me in order to get me the car I wanted at a price I could afford with minimal discomfort. I felt I was seen and respected as a person by everyone involved with the car buying experience, as opposed to being treated as just another means to an end: the selling of a car. As a consequence, I have no reservations about recommending Claremont Toyota to anyone looking and hoping for a positive car buying experience!<//Text>< Pics>

One week ago I walked into this dealership hoping to trade in my honda civic. The salesperson Brian Olvera. helped me choose the best car for me, he showed me all of the different models, safety features and most importantly the prices. I ended up driving away in a 2021 Toyota CHR all thanks to Brian who helped me make the right choice. I would recommend this dealership to anyone looking to buy a new car.<//review>

My dad and I called about a used car about a week ago, and told the salesman the price we were willing to pay. We live in San Diego and didn't want to drive 2 hours plus risk covid just to browse and haggle, especially with the risk of Covid. The salesman said he would call us back in a few days to let us know if he could match our price.
Turns out, he could match our price! He said he didn't want to waste our time and make us drive, so he guaranteed our price out the door on the phone before we drove up. I was excited and we drove on up.
We looked at the car, everything was great, and sat down to make it official.
At the last second, the manager said he didn't approve of the sale and wouldn't budge on the price we agreed on.
It's sad that Toyota Claremont is willing to mislead you and make false promises only to end up wasting your time on the lot. I find it dangerous that they knew we couldn't afford their price yet mislead us to get us to come out there knowing that there is a pandemic occurring.
Overall, don't waste people's time and possibly health to make a few bucks! Our time was wasted and we were promised a deal that you all fell through on.< /review>

Michael Marquez, the service manager, is truly a disappointment. Mike kept indirectly insisting that the damage on my car was not done by them and that they could not do anything about it, but I referred him to the before and after pictures of when my car got dropped off for service versus when I picked it up. Even when I was referring to the before and after pictures, he pointed out the "after" picture (the one that is dented) saying it was already there. If he was patient enough he would try to understand what I was saying before jumping to conclusions. I have never felt so disappointed where I feel the need to write such a review on a website like this. For being a manager, Mike is completely not qualified. Mike kept trying to point out other possibilities besides themselves about how my panel could have gotten dented, I kept saying no it has to be you guys because here are the before and after pictures. The dents were obviously made during my car's time at the dealership. Mike is just a poor excuse for being someone in a managerial position. The only reason why this deserves 2 stars is because the service agent who helped me out was delightful, her name is Candace.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Derrick Bates and team were great, solid deal on a ‘21 Sequoia Platinum and legit price on our trade-in, huge inventory, smooth and quick process (<2hrs including the test drive). Very easy to access right off the 10 freeway, nice building and massive lot so you can search for your exact match, worth checking out.</Review>

<Review>I purchased my brand new highlander with Ryan Crenshaw today at Claremont Toyota. Ryan is such a gentleman. I couldn’t have been more pleased. The customer service he provided was absolutely unbelievable. I test drove a few cars with Chris Barreto prior to deciding on the highlander and he was so amazing. My old car I purchased at Toyota auto nation in Irvine and there was absolutely no comparison in the customer service that I received. I was in an out so quickly, my car was so clean, I got two keys, car mats and my manuals which I didn’t receive from auto nation in Irvine. Chris Barreto walked me through every inch of my new highlander so that I could feel comfortable on the road. I’m now home with my amazing new car and I will now only ever get a car from Claremont Toyota. Thank you Ryan and Chris !!!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

The customer services was fantastic at this dealership!  The entire staff from the front desk to financing were so helpful and kind throughout the process of leasing our car.  Felix was our salesperson, and we could tell he loved his job right away, he was so eager to help us find the perfect car for our family.  He walked us through a few selections, and we never felt any pressure to commit to anything right away.  The manager on duty both times we were there, he was also very helpful and kind, we felt he went out of his way to give us a great deal on or lease. We told them we would stop by the competition to view other options, but when we left we both agreed the customer service was so great and genuine at Toyota that we just drove straight home and started to call our insurance company for quotes on the new car.  Financing was also great, the gentleman was very friendly and Informative and we understood all aspects of the contract before signing it.
Couldn’t be more happy with our experience at Claremont Toyota and we will definitely be back!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

I had an appointment for a free lifetime oil change at 1pm. We checked were checked in about 1:13.  We told them we would wait in the lounge thinking  it would not take longer than an hour. Wrong!  It took 3hrs. How is that?  The agent , Olive,was very polite and professional. Need to work on your service time for people that have an appointment< /review>

<review>Unprofessional customer service highlighted a visit that should have ended with a care sale. Instead the finale was highlighted by a ride home in my old car, laughing about the experience I will never forget.

Scams attempted: (in order of appearance)

1. Price of vehicle shown online didn't match Paper price. Made an obvious lie saying it was a mistake to cover for an attempt at hoping I was a negligent buyer. (warranty declinedat this point see below)

2. Initial finance data provided no break down. Only showed Monthly payment. I had to ask 3 times for a break down. They would not provide data on what financial institution was providing the loan. Sketchy as all what not tactics are a reoccurring theme.

2. Fake fees tacked on. Including a "weight fee" that magically brought the vehicle back up to the sticker price.

3. Inflated taxes. Which magically disappeared when I pointed out the math wasn't adding up.

4. The manager arrival technique. Without my prompting the sales person brought in the original data absent paperwork, and attempted to comment about the "great price" and how "cool" the car was. I had to ask again for a line item breakdown of costs, taxes, fees and whatever else was included in the final price.

5. The alarm is optional and you need it because people use their phones to steal cars these days scam. Let's all just apply common sense to this one.

6. The extended warranty brought back into price, even though I declined it at outset.

Other highlights:

The test drive was an education session for the... wait for it... sales associate who knew nothing about the car. If you don't know what you are trying to sell, people who deal in research like me will see right through your ruse.

I made a fair cash offer, and I mean fair. Which, because they weren't getting an in house finance they kept avoiding, and pushing the financing. a comment made at least three times. "Just finance it and you can pay it off early. there's no early termination fee, it doesn't hurt at all." Common sense people... will take you far. That is of course if mathematical analysis and simple interest formulas are part of your common culture.

When i made the cash offer, and said final offer or ill walk. they pushed financing again, which at this point is blatant rude bordering harassment, then proceeded to follow me outside to push it a final time.

This dealer is the real deal, if the deal you are looking for is an experience with how horrible dealership experiences can be.<//review></record>

<review>I can’t give it a perfect rating because of customer service  but I will give it close to perfect because of their customer service.

Here’s the thing, I went in after my car got stolen and totaled just to browse around for a Camry. On that initial visit the sale rep was convincing me that whatever they have on the lot, that’s it cause of the pandemic, and therefor I ended up purchasing a Camry of a color I didn’t really want because he made me feel like if I don’t get a car now I may lose out on what I want and won’t get another chance until after the pandemic is more controlled and this happened when Covid first introduced itself to the states and I couldn’t wait that long for a vehicle so I ended up making a purchase that day. At that time the sales rep didn’t even go over general vehicle features after I decided on which Camry I was going to take and that was it.

When I went to take my Camry for the first service I was browsing at all the other camry’s they just got and I was obviously bothered because the last guy told me Toyota was no longer going to be making any more vehicles so they can aid with the pandemic.

Jesse walked up to me as he noticed I was looking around. I explained to him this whole situation and he listened closely and apologized for the misinformation I was given and we needed up talking about what kind of Camry I was looking for and which color. Jesse found my car and he did everything he could to get me a good deal! The difference turned out to be a little higher than matched but I got some extra warranties.

I guess when it comes down to it, it’s really all about which individuals help you.

But If you want a good experience ask for Jesse to help you look at the product. He will not only make you feel comfortable in your possible new purchase  but he will answer any questions you have with integrity and even demonstrate all the features a vehicle has.

I persisted Jesse that I wasn’t going to do any trade in but his dedication to help me get what I really wanted and to be able to get a good deal out of it was definitely noticed and appreciated. And now I have a really beautiful Camry.

Thanks to Jesse and the rest of the Toyota team! Don’t let one person ruin your judgement Toyota Claremont is the place to go for cars!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<text>3/8/2021 Very disappointed.  Wife went in to get an oil change and airbag recall done on our car. They did an inspection on the car and didn't go over it with my wife or tell her that the breaks were done. We would of got them done the same day. Was driving this last weekend with my wife and child in the car and the breaks start screeching, very dangerously. Will never return to this location again. Please let your customers know this type of crucial information. Thank you!

3/10/2021 Thank you for your response. I to hope this doesn't happen to someone else as well, very dangerous and was inconvenient. Today we went to another dealership and had the repairs done and more was needed because of them not done sooner, and addressed before. Please let your team know.  Thank you!</text>< GmapID>

<Text>I had been shopping for a Tacoma for a couple of months. I had contacted Claremont Toyota early on in my search as I had purchased a vehicle from them prior and was happy with the transaction. I made contact with Derrick Bates. He checked the stock and told me that they did not have one equipped as I wanted. Derrick mentioned that he would keep an eye out for one like I was looking for.

I continued my shopping. I contacted numerous dealers who said they had one like I was looking for. After going to the dealers and seeing that they were either just telling me they had one and then trying to replace it with something different or they inflated the price so high that the sale was ridiculous I was getting really burned out and was ready to just wait a few months.

Derrick contacted me as he had followed through on his promise to look for a vehicle for me. He said he had one in transit that would be the one I was looking for. I was very doubtful that he had the vehicle considering all of the problems I had with other dealers. He was very positive and attentive to my concerns.  He assured me that this was the correct vehicle for me. He put me in contact with the sales manager Alex Rosa. Alex confirmed the vehicle was in transit and he gave me a promise of what the price was going to be.

So I went to the dealer and contacted Derrick and Alex. They were both great. Both very sincere, helpful, and respectful of my time and came through on all of their promises. Something I did not think was going to happen.

Derrick brought me to the finance officer, Arturo Hermosillo. He was quick and very professional. No pressure.

Derrick, and Alex went so far beyond normal and out of their way to make this a honest, comfortable and perfect transaction.  Arturo made the finance section so easy and quick.

I could not be more satisfied with any purchase transaction. I am a very happy customer and will return to Claremont Toyota when the need arises for service or another vehicle.<//Text>< pictures>

I bought my car from here like a year and half ago. I had a problem with the battery first, but I got help from an employee there named Janeth, she was very helpful and they put a brand new battery. I come here to change oil every 10000 miles and do regular service. They are nice and helpful all the time. I always get a discount for oil change and regular service, because I bought my car from her too.<//Text>

<review>I would like to thank Ryan Crenshaw, General Manager for contacting me regarding my previous review. He called the next day first thing in the morning and gave us options to rectify salesman mistake.

I went to dealership again and meet with him and new salesman Fernando Fuentes both individuals were very professional and great customer service. Ryan took his time to explain the different options available to rectify issue. Fernando assisted with showing us different car options.

I was hesitant to go back to dealer because I felt I was going to get the run around. In the end very grateful for the customer service I received and the resolution to my situation. Thanks for the upgrade.

I am very disappointed in my experience with this dealership. They are unprofessional with their scheduling services and the salesperson I worked with was not genuine, cheesy, at times condescending and way too pushy. I ended up walking away for the second time due to poor customer service. In addition they had very loud, not appropriate music playing. I will never return to this dealership unfortunately.</Text>

If only I can give this dealership minus 5 stars. I agree with the other customers. What is the point of scheduling an appointment if it takes 2 hours and counting to get the service completed. The service person was nice enough to manplain it to me. How come it takes less time to perform the exact same maintenance at a different dealership? Please explain that one. It says that 2pm is the least busy time for this dealership on google.
Update the service manager just told me that it takes 3-4 hours for a simple oil change and tire rotation. They say they are a high volume dealership. This is one of the smaller dealerships I have been to. High volume but they still manually check you in where other dealerships are computerized. They definitely think too highly of themselves. Will be leaving a review on yelp as well.

I finally got my car after 3 hours and 45 minutes. The cause of the delay was due to them not being able to remove my oil filter. At least this was the reason I was given. The service guys said the last person who changed my oil tightened my filter too tight. The last place that did my oil
Change was a different toyota dealership. The other dealership never had trouble changing my oil or completing the task within the time they estimated, 2 hours. After I said I would take my car back to the other dealership, Claremont toyota was magically able to remove my oil filter. It took them 3 hours to come and tell me the problem, which I pointed out to the service person. Javier responded by stating and I quote “I am trying to do you a favor here. I could have told them to cut it out then you would have been out $70 for a new part.” I said  wow.. is this how you operate here? You will authorize addition work on my car that would cost me more money without my permission? I believe that is illegal.  Why would I ever want to repeat my experience at this dealership.
Don’t let them fool you into thinking they care about their customers. I sent the customer relations manager an email detailing my experience and did not get a response back. Them reply to these reviews is  just for show.  They have no intentions of ever resolving anything from there lack of response. They will write a few sentences responding to these reviews but I have yet to receive  a response to my email.  Do not go to this dealership, especially if you are a woman. They will not take you seriously and talk down to you.<//Review>

I brought in my Corolla last week to the service center for my airbag recall. I came around 10:30, they said it'll be done around 5 or 6. No problem, I understand usually repairs takes this long. However, I don't understand is that my horn on the car wheel which was working perfectly fine the day before does not work anymore. I told them that maybe in the process of fixing the airbag on the steering wheel that they inadvertently damaged the car horn. The horn doesn't just stop working overnight. No they said, and they were gonna charge $140 for them to fix it. Seriously? Well I'm not going there ever again to fix my car anymore.<//Text>

I'm giving 2 stars instead of one because the main manager was nice. But let me tell you what happened.

I bought a corolla hybrid from here about a week ago. I spoke to someone on the phone and email telling me I can get a 21 corolla hybrid for $20,900. I had already gotten other dealerships down to around that price, so they said they'll beat it if I come today. So I went. Spoke to a guy named rick, I explained to him I wanted to trade in my car and get a new one. I told him I came because he told me this price(20,900). He says he can't do this price, and the lowest he can do is 21,500. I told him how I already had an offer for 21,000$ so there's no way. I got up to leave and Rick said give him a sec to talk to the manager. So he came back and said ok, they can sell me the car for 20,900. Even though I had to fight for a price he quoted me over the phone, I was happy.

That was a little problem compared to what happened next. So for my trade in, I told them I owe around 11,700 and kbb said it's worth 13k in fair condition, so I didn't care as long as they paid off my old car I would be happy. Rick said deal. Rick told me they're going to give me the full amount for my car(11,700) so it can be paid off. So when signing the paperwork for the new car, I noticed an extra $1200 added to my total price after taxes and fees. The guy that does the paperwork tells me that they were going to give me only 10,500 for my car so the 1200$ remaining balance would go into this new loan. Me and my girlfriend called rick over to talk about this and he pretty much lied to our face. He said that he never said this. He said that he told us we were only getting 10,500 for the trade in. He lied to our face. The main manager stepped in about an hour later to tell us they will give the full amount I owe for the car (11,700).

I was happy with my purchase! I love my car! But just want everyone to know to READ YOUR PAPERWORK! Don't take their word for it. Rick almost snuck in an extra 1200$ on my new loan. Don't let it happen to you.< /text>

Bait and Switch-Beware! Called in to get my ac serviced. Just a basic evacuate & recharge. Was quoted $195 over the phone, showed up in the afternoon and bamm--the price had gone up to $279 as I walked in the door.

<Rating>2< /Rating><review>My wife and I just purchased a used car from these people and the car has some obvious defects that are more unreasonable for a used car than the norm issues which should have been caught when the car was accepted as a trade by it's previous owner. This dealership also rolled our deal without actually having an approval from a bank which I find to be grossly negligent. Our sales man was  a very good guy I highly recommend Jacob, but unless you're willing to take home stress and anxiety don't leave here with a new or used car unless you have an actual approval from a bank!!! 🤬😡🤬😡🤮 Entire situation makes me want to VOMIT</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9NUhF3mjea7uY26V_nFFnkSMFeoNkR3G9embQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPk6r-sBsb2SjNDXXMLZOqP5CpVcEnibV6HYHAX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbh0w1VmUlwAalZcZA0ZBDewMQu-nE-yBq2XfC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMeMfZPrmD2U21cjUggm1793RZuKbywsa5gM3eN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyQwq6UwMPjgr-3GMx_IN9GCTd9mV7vmJI71XA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTafAT0RGqKtksk4egrECenu4BNI1YU8k6Rtif=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMyAyw8IEo72wvqTTignsgbiTaOfKokvK3f1zTE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfdRF5x-eeohV1KwyPWO6eHCHMzUPeLzohl3kF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOESY_5mEM9WoexVONO7pyxDO1mVw5hL5Yb1wk3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHy8iuUpLsPA0bVlQR3J2FdJEh2ex4mb2AWOXd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwM6NNL087eDOJ8BNIu24HZci71w7GrvDncyAq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8z6ss5pRxgqhTXg2qCExi3-QaUDVBZqrUlty6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

<Review>What is the purpose to schedule an appointment for service? I came to drop off my vehicle for an oil change and my scheduled appointment was at 2:00 pm. When I received the paperwork it said:  "estimated completion time 16:00". When I went inside about 4:30 pm to ask if my car was ready, the advisor said: no, your car is not ready, but don't worry we close at 5:00 pm. Really?? It's 4:50  pm and my car is not ready yet.< /Review>< Pics>

Louis Medina (fleet manager) made our experience exceptional. We had done our research and knew what we wanted. We called ahead and made sure that the specific vehicle was on the lot.

When we arrived, we were greeted and shown the vehicle quickly. Louis was personable and knowledgeable and showed us a few things about the vehicle that we weren't aware of.

We ended up with a very fair deal and are super happy with our purchase. We will definitely be back!!!

Thank you Louis! 100/100< /review>

<Text>My husband and I purchased a New Tundra TRD Pro and Handy was our salesman who greeted us with excellent service upon arrival, Momo & Alex are both Managers and worked with us and gave us a deal we couldn’t refuse on a new vehicle. Kari was friendly and helpful and Juan in Finance handled our paperwork less then a half hour. This dealer is under new ownership but the great customer experience and service continues. A few days after purchasing our vehicle customer relations called and checked in on us to ensure everything was going well. The entire Toyota team is outstanding! Definitely recommend this dealer to our family and friends and will be back for our next vehicle.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

< Review>
Took my Camry in for Toyota care standard factory maintenance 5 times in 25k miles which unfortunately I assumed at least 1 tire rotation would be completed as it’s included with Toyota Care. Because of multiple lazy technicians negligence in the service department I had to buy 1 tire prematurely because they were measured at 2, 4, 6, 6.  The 2 & 4 we’re right front and rear and now I have to go back and get another tire in a month and waste more of my time.  I’m also not under warranty on the tire because I didn’t get 2 and now they’re wearing unevenly.  All because these guys want to take short cuts and not do their job correctly. What else wasn’t done or checked while my car was there being ‘serviced ‘?< /Review>

<Review>Great purchasing experience.   The sales  manager Brandon Martinez was extremely helpful in locating the 4runner we wanted.  I recently moved to Arizona but drove back to Claremont Toyota because of past positive car purchasing experiences.   Mr Martinez gave me a fair price for our trade in and on the 4runner.  The sales person was also very helpful and walked me through on how to use the 4runners accessories.<//Review>< pictures>

Edgar helped me get a new Toyota Corolla since my last car was pretty much on its last legs. They helped me pick out the car I loved the most since they have a huge selection. And the financing was simple, I highly suggest this dealership, if so go and ask for Edgar De La Rosa he understood what car I was looking for and he helped me get the car. Overall wonderful experience (:<//text>

<Review>I reached the end of my lease and surrendered my car at this dealership.  While I don't need to lease or buy another car currently, the service provided by Daniel Rossi was second to none.  Will definitely buy or lease from this place in the future, specifically due to how easy it was to work with Daniel.<//Review>< Name>

If anyone wants to be treated like family when they go to Claremont Toyota simply ask to see Scott in service.  He literally goes out of his way to make sure that you are well taken care of.  I have been going there for over 6 years now and he is the only one that I schedule my visits with.  I don't take anything away from the other employees I am just stating that Scott has always taken exceptional care of my Toyota vehicle and has ALWAYS made me feel like family.  Thank you Scott!!!</Text>

I came in from out of town with what I was told was an alternator problem by an auto parts store.
I didn’t have an appointment,they were wonderful to me.
They took my van in  to check out the problem no problem.
I was given a ride to a rental car.
It turned out it was a dead battery which was replaced for free because it was under warranty.
Wonderful dealership!</text>

Have been searching for a car for a while. By far the best deal my husband and I came across... I highly recommend Mohammed & YQ /John both of them were phenomenal. Of course this is a dealership so there was negotiating but in the end they both did their best and were able to get us to the monthly payment we wanted! Again they really worked hard to get us what we wanted and it took time but we got there. Ultimately, after searching and negotiating with other dealerships Mohammed  and YQ/John were the only ones able to make something happen. Also, besides making a great deal, they weren't pushy or a-holes like some others we had to deal with at other dealerships. I highly recommend Claremont Toyota, specifically those guys, if you're looking to buy or lease. Good luck</text>

<username>Albert Garcia<//username><rate>4< /rate><Text>I took my time writing this review, it's been a month since bought my car. I appreciate how they were while to help make my payments lower. Pablo was a really nice guy and he was responsible for getting me back there because he was will to bring down the price. I wish he was more knowledgeable about my particular car but with all makes and model I can't expect too much.
My problem came the 2nd day after purchasing the car. The warning light for a flat tire came on. I didn't think much of it because there was a weather change and that can change your tire pressure. It kept happening so I knew I had a small leak, I do have a long commute so I have no doubt it could have been a nail. When I took it to America Tires for repair they didn't feel comfortable patching it because the leak was coming from a plug already in the tire. The dealer told me they don't recommend patching these tires, instead replace the whole tire. So it bugs me that they didn't let me know about the plug, in my experience a plug is worst than a patch. I would have had them put new tires on and add it to my overall payment.
To be fair the plug could have been put in by the previous owner. I can't say that they knew about the plug in the first place. My overall experience was good. They are willing to work with you, just do your research and ask lots of questions.</Text><response>None</response>< time>

I tried calling 4 times to schedule an oil change, I would get transferred to the service department, the phone would ring for 2 minutes and then get disconnected. Then I FINALLY got through, made an appointment, and I'm sitting here now, I've been waiting for 2 HOURS for an oil change! This is the most ridiculous thing ever! It should take 30-45 minutes max for an oil change! What is the point of the Toyota care service if I have to waste a whole day sitting around for my car?<//text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>My salesmen Chris was very nice. We really liked him. He n his manager came from another Toyota dealer but they both knew there way around with my daughters car n worked the numbers in her favor. She was hesitant to make the purchase so the manager offered to loan her the car to drive the entire day to help her decide. Thats all it took! She drive off the lot n returned within 5 mins! Sold! They made a very stressful situation of buying a car easy n a pleasure. Thankyou Claremont Toyota! We Will Return!<//Review>< pics>

< Review>
I tried calling 4 times to schedule an oil change, I would get transferred to the service department, the phone would ring for 2 minutes and then get disconnected. Then I FINALLY got through, made an appointment, and I'm sitting here now, I've been waiting for 2 HOURS for an oil change! This is the most ridiculous thing ever! It should take 30-45 minutes max for an oil change! What is the point of the Toyota care service if I have to waste a whole day sitting around for my car?<//Review>

<text>Jake in the service department was so easy to work with. They handled everything in a professional and quick manner. The communication was amazing! I also have a Nissan and dealing with THAT dealership down the street is a complete nightmare in comparison. Buy your car and have it serviced here and you won’t be disappointed.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I need to add my services experience that was great and professional. I need to thank Jacob who is  services manager as he was very helpful and he explained everything needed to be maintained in my car in exact time. He answered all my questions. I really appreciate his respect, help and patience. Thanks Jake. Excellent services.

Claremont Toyota is one of the best dealer ship I’ve been at. Customer service was really great. Dolores was the one who helped me to get the car that I want. And she was really nice and funny. I would definitely come back and buy my next car at Claremont Toyota.</Review>

<review>We recently purchased a vehicle from Claremont Toyota. Prosper took the time to patiently explain all of our options. We had not purchased a new vehicle in 22 years so this was a LOT of patience on his part. His professional and considerate nature will ensure that we will continue doing business here.

We met with Calvin at Claremont Toyota. He really helped us find the right car for us. We ended up getting a Prius Prime and we love it. Calvin helped make the whole experience smooth and easy. If you go to Claremont Toyota, request Calvin. The rest of the team supporting Calvin was also great! We will continue going to Claremont Toyota.</review>

Am giving this 1 ⭐ because I went in to get the airbag recall repair 1 year ago and when I took my matrix in to get replacement of the airbag there was no light on my dashboard. Had to call 1 tech that then 2 more service techs said that they didn't notice it that some one else had tampered it. Ok I didn't leave the lot so it wasn't me. I just wanted to leave, Then I get offered to trade in my car for a newer it would be nice but I just want my light to turn off.
The tech said the light should reset and turn off.
Well 1 yr later and STILL the light has not been reseted. So for recall routine service take video and pictures of your car before they service it.
ALSO make sure to check your car before you leave the lot.</Text>

<review>I have purchased two vehicles from this location and I have had a  pretty good experience. Because of the good deal I got I recommended my parents to go and get a car also with them. They kept insisting to get the 3 year extension warranty. We ending up getting it so the cost of the car was more money. My parents live in LA. They left the car with me for one week when they pick it up they were able enjoy their new used car jut to find out in this cold cold winter the heater does not work. My step dad said to make an appointment so that he can come to get it fixed. I called Toyota they said on Saturday’s we don’t make appointments because the person in charge is not there so to just come as a walk in also that they open at 7am. My parents got there at 730am checked in and waited and waited and waited for five hours and more almost six hours and no results. No one told them that the technician who fixes the electrical issues was not there to help them out. After the fact that my parents ended getting a four year warranty extension now Toyota does not comply with their policy of extension. I am terribly sad my mom had to wait six hours just to let them know there is no one to help you today come back another day. I think that is just very bad service and I regret my recommendations to this place I did not think they would do this. If I could give 0 star I would but at least I have to give 1 star to tell my story.<//review>< Pictures>

They handled a Hybrid traction battery warranty replacement like a champ! No charge to me and replaced the bad one with a whole brand new battery. Also standard, since I lived in Chino, they gave me a ride home and also picked me up when it was time to get my car.

I was attended by Edin (salesperson) and he immediately helped me and my family out. I am an Office Manager at a small, local car dealership myself and we pride ourselves in honesty and open communication with our customers and that's EXACTLY what I received from Edin. He didn't try selling me up or down. He was honest, straight-forward and most of all CARED about me as a customer. And i did not even tell him that we work in the same industry until after He saw my application. I knew what I wanted and he helped me to narrow down my choices between two vehicles. I always hear horror stories from my customers about the "bigger dealerships" and how they've been deceived and lied to. But this dealership is TRULY an open book. If you go in with an open mind, patience and a willingness to learn about the car buying process, Claremont Toyota is going to help you out. I highly recommend Edin! He has lots of experience and will help you to find THE perfect vehicle for you.

Great service!! We went into this dealership with thoughts of just looking around and test driving some cars and trucks. Our salesman gave us an incredible experience walked with us showed us around and completely convinced us on our amazing buy. We ended up walking out with a truck for our soon to be family of 4. I really reccomend this dealership to anyone looking to buy a new vehicle. They really are a great help very patient and great walk through!!</Review>

Took my Camry in for Toyota care standard factory maintenance 5 times in 25k miles which unfortunately I assumed at least 1 tire rotation would be completed as it’s included with Toyota Care. Because of multiple lazy technicians negligence in the service department I had to buy 1 tire prematurely because they were measured at 2, 4, 6, 6.  The 2 & 4 we’re right front and rear and now I have to go back and get another tire in a month and waste more of my time.  I’m also not under warranty on the tire because I didn’t get 2 and now they’re wearing unevenly.  All because these guys want to take short cuts and not do their job correctly. What else wasn’t done or checked while my car was there being ‘serviced ‘?<//Text>

< review>
First time I come to this dealer. I've owned 4 Toyota vehicles and I have always been treated nicely. I went for service to my 2019 Camry, and I have always gotten a complementary car wash with the service and good service. I was treated as if they did not wanted me to return. I don't care if they couldn't wash my car, but I was told that the dealership do not have personnel to wash vehicles, and that the city has a water shortage. 🤔 Really???
Who washes the new vehicles?? Once the car was ready I was called to get my vehicle,  and the guy did not handed me the keys but walked away leaving my vehicle. I felt as if once I bought the car I was not a priority to them. Maybe I'm overreacting, but I'm used to be given good customer service by other dealerships.< /review>

Not good. I was told that the life oil change that we have is no longer available. Due to new owner change. Claremont Toyota is not the same with good customer service. A business that doesn't care about their  customers, but  their own  profit.</Review>

<Review>UPDATE:
I never go back and fix a review, but Claremont Toyota is doing something right! They seemed to have hired new staff and they are AMAZING! That Chad guy was nowhere in sight. And people there seemed to enjoy their job now. Nothing but positive vibes when I took my 2018 4Runner for its 25k mile service. Kim was extremely helpful all around and FRIENDLY, customer service was so on point I had to come back and change my review up. I am definitely coming back here for all my future vehicle upgrades and maintenance/services. - Danny M

I bought our 2018 4Runner here, and the sales people are great here, but if you ever go for service here BEWARE of the unprofessional Assistant Manager Chad. He has horrible communication skills and customer service skills. I was there this week for a check engine light that came on, I went during my lunch hour to have the vehicle dropped off and worked on while I was at work. From the start Chad appeared to be in a bad mood and irritable(as if he hated working there). That’s none of my business but don’t let a job you hate run off negativity to your customers. Moving on, I was told the car would be ready by 3-4 I called around 4:30 for a status update and Chad said he will call me back in a few minutes. An HOUR passed and he never did. I arrived around 5:45 and asked him if my car was ready, he ignored me and walked to his printer, came back to his desk, took a deep breath and said “I will check”. He then walked towards the area were they work on cars and another customer asked him for a status update as they arrived, he told them as well he would check and I waited again another 20 minutes until he finished with the customer that came after me. When he comes back I asked him again for a status update, he got up and walked again to the service area (he forgot to ask about my car!). He comes back only to say my issue was not resolved because there was not enough time and I had to schedule another appointment. I would not recommend ANY Family or friends to this place ever again!< /Review>< Rating>

<review>Arrived at 1125 am for a oil change,  was told my vehicle would be done between 1 and 130 pm. My vehicle was parked in the outside lot the whole time, so at 135 (vehicle still has NOT been touched) I asked for my service advisor Jeremy. Jeremy was out to lunch so I was referred to another service advisor.  I told him that my truck had not been moved and wanted to have an update. By that time it was 145. He told me my vehicle was the next one up. So I then stepped outside and watched about 10 vehicles go inside and get serviced, while mine sat there. Finally at 240 went inside and asked for my keys. ....this dealership is a joke! Terrible customer service.<//review>< Gmap_id>

Don't go into this dealership, the salesman Peter (pedro) is the worst in their kind. He never explained to my dad why that dealer has you pay thousands more then the MSRP price and hides the addendum that's on the window so you can't see why your paying more. They just decide that they'll charge you more. Then when you go ask for a copy of that paper, they forged your signature and say you knew because you signed it. I even spoke to the supposed manager Zupe and he knew what they did but said it was signed by my dad but still couldn't show me an original. Beware of these fraudulent people that take advantage of innocent people.<//Review>

Yes, the donuts and coffee are great, but the employees are the ones that keep me coming back. Considering how many customers come to the shop, my wait time is extremely reasonable. A ride home is always available if I decide not to wait.

I would be giving them a zero but they actually helped my Grandmother this last time. As far as that last visit they were really cool they took care of her. Times before that they didn't do well as far as customer service to a 76 year old lady. The time before last After my Grandmother drove off I went back in and Spoke with a customer service manager and told him everything that had happened. He wasn't happy and said he would be taking care of it. So this last vist going well could have had something to do with that.</text>

My review is solely based on buying tires here. They may have great deals (buy 3 get 1 free etc) but you get what you pay for on the service side. If you're in need of tires I strongly recommend American Tires. I made the mistake of purchasing here because if the deal but "you get what you pay for" so now their telling me I have to wait amongst all the appointment to get my flat fixed??? Don't offer a service you can't provide for in a timely manner. I'm not trying to wait 4+ hours for a tire repair.< /text>

Yesterday I bought a new 2018 Toyota Camry from the fine folks at Claremont Toyota. My first new car purchase in over 25 years! Peter Mehanna helped me out. He was very knowledgeable and took his time until I found the exact car I would be happy with. Overall a very smooth transaction with great financing options. I can highly recommend.</review>

When I got my Corolla back, they had not dismissed the maintance reminder light and disconnected my dash cam.   I also left it with them an extra day so it would not be a rush order.  That made me wonder if all the $500 in services were done.  And they still don't do car washes.  I'm not going back.< /Text>

I've been coming to this service department for over 8 years now. Every time I come in I am greeted with a smile and with great customer service. Yes, the donuts and coffee are great, but the employees are the ones that keep me coming back. Considering how many customers come to the shop, my wait time is extremely reasonable. A ride home is always available if I decide not to wait. Tony Sanchez has helped maintain my Toyota in great running condition and is one of the many reasons I continue to come here.</text>

< review>
My experience at Claremont  Toyota which will be listed was a largely negative experience. However, I will mention both the good and the bad.

The Good:
The environment was extremely cleanly and all of the lower level staff were extremely polite at all times.
The shuttle service for those seeking to go elsewhere is free and fast.

The bad: I went in for a recalled airbag, I made an appointment, showed up and was informed the car part had not arrived  and that they were sorry, sales offered to fill up my tank next time which I accepted. The repair takes 6 hours although I am initially told 4.  My shuttle back is an uncomfortable half hour listening to (not my choice) conservative talk radio and hearing the driver tell me how great Donald Trump is.

When I inquired over the delay management bristled, insisting that this is "normal" that an appointment didn't really mean you would get your car repairs would get started but was an arbitrary placeholder.  When I went to sales (as the service manager had left for the day) I was sold a barnyard variety of excuses. Rather than anything resembling accountability.

Bottom Line:  I did not take the gasoline.  They are untrustworthy and unprofessional. These are not traits I seek in my mechanic, or my car dealer.<//review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>Worst experience I have ever had. I had purchased a vehicle from here once in the past and was hoping for the same positive experience. unfortunately, this dealer has made some changes since I came here last, for the worst. The purchase experience here was horrible this time. The sales manager not only tried to sell me a price for a completely different car, but managed to screw me over when it came to the terms of the deal on my car. I agreed to 60 months with the sales manager and was asking them to bring down the price on the car so I could afford it. They worked with me to bring down the monthly payment so I could get the car, but changed the length of the contract without even a mention of it. The finance department did a great job of asking me to sign the digital pad while distracting me so I wouldn't know the terms of the contract. Sales manager ended up changing the length of the contract to 72 months and was proud of his accomplishment of selling the car at a higher than market value price. Thank you for screwing over a long time customer. I will gladly recommend everyone to stay away from this dealer until these horrible people are replaced. Do not go there to buy a car! There are way better places to buy a better car with a better purchasing experience!</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
There is no point to make an appointment because it will still take 3 hours for just an oil change.   While waiting I saw nothing put pushy sales bullying couples.  More pushy then normal car salesmen.  I also went to look at a truck and the guy didn't even want to get the keys like I was wasting his time or I couldnt afford it.  He got mad at me it seemed when I couldn't understand his accent.  If you're close enough to Claremont you might as well go to ontario mills. They are way more accommodating. They would of informed me it would be 3 hours and offered a ride home. I've been in and out of ontario without an appointment  in an hour. DONT GO TO CLAREMONT TOYOTA!!  0 STARS!!<//Review>

I live in Orange, but make the drive to Claremont Toyota for service on my Tacoma because of the trustworthy service of Mr. Jeremy Wright.  His honest and straightforward approach in communicating to me the repairs and maintenance that need immediate attention, and those that can wait until my next appointment is beyond rare.< /text>

<text>I bought a Toyota in the beginning of the year and have returned a few times since for maintenance. I had different people helping me at different times but just this past Saturday I met Jeremy Wright for the first time and he is absolutely the best. He takes very good care of people and he takes the time to explain everything with such honesty and genuineness. I really appreciated his help and he gives the best customer service. A really good guy that I felt like I could trust. Thank you Jeremy!</text>< Time>

<Review>My experience here was great. I bought my first new car from here and all the people at the dealership were very friendly and helpful. The process was easy and by the time I got out of finance my car was all clean and ready to go. I highly recommend Claremont Toyota for anyone because everybody there is friendly and the prices and rates are unbeatable.</Review><gmap_id>0x80c331f0f867730f:0xe1438d5499139ad0< /gmap_id><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Had an amazing HASSEL-FREE experience. My husband and I had been shopping for a Toyota Tacoma for the past three weeks and couldn’t find the right price or the right people to give our sale to. Went to Claremont, which is a 25 mile drive from where we live, and we realized we should have gone there first! From the start it felt right. Thank you to all that helped us on the day that we purchased our Toyota Tacoma! Look For Bernie Muñoz, “Tin Tan,” you won’t regret it!<//Text>

As a first-time buyer, I can honestly say I had an exceptional experience. People always make the idea of buying a car seem so stressful and almost unpleasant but my experience at the Claremont Toyota was car from that. The sales rep went above and beyond to make sure I understood what everything meant and answered my questions honestly and thoroughly. The process itself was fairly quick since I believe both parties wanted the same thing: for me to walk out happy with my new car at a good price. The service agreement is phenomenal. Great team and great service! And I’m loving my new Camry :) highly recommend this place!<//text>

I would definately purchase another vehicle from Claremont Toyota. The sales person we contacted was Calvin. Calvin was not over bearing and when I  told him my wife and I would have to pray about the offer on the vehicle he told us he understood. We came in the next morning to make the purchase of a 2015 Toyota Rav 4. While walking out of the finance office we met Calvin who told us praying over the purchase of the vehicle was good because if you come 10 minutes later that person who just drove by us to go on a test drive with a sale person was here to buy the Rav 4 we had just purchase.

Thank you Claremont Toyota  & Calvin for a great experience we had with the purchase of our vehicle. May the Lord continue to bless the Claremont Toyota family!

<Review>Claremont Toyota has been the most exceptional location I have been to. Many of the other locations I visited were rude, untrustworthy and tried to manipulate me for personal gain (Ontario Crown Toyota). I took a chance and decided to give my car searching one more try, and I am ecstatic that i did. Ricky Hernandez was the sales rep I sat down with and discussed my past experiences. He not only listened to my concerns he succeeded in helping me seal the deal. He was patient, understanding, and honest. By far the best salesman I have ever dealt with. His genuine demeanor and knowledgeable persona encouraged me to leave with my head held high in my brand new 2016 Toyota Corolla. I encourage anyone reading this to not waste your time going to any other dealership everything you need will be at Claremont Toyota.

I recommend any and all individuals who are interested in purchasing a car to visit Claremont Toyota and ask for Ricky Hernandez, you will not regret it!!!</Review>< Pictures>

I was told from a different Toyota location, I needed a new timing belt, but was holding off on the service. But when I took my car in to Claremont,  the service representative, Tony Sanchez was very helpful and very HONEST! He told me my timing belt was fine and did not need to replace it. Made me think that the other Toyota location was trying to make a sell and have me purchase a service I did not need. Tony also gave me a coupon for my service which was greatly appreciated. Definitely recommend Tony Sanchez for your service needs. Thanks Tony!<//text>< Rate>

<text>They team treated me very professionally they also gave me the free car wash. I asked if I can test drive multiple cars and they accommodate that for me. The only thing is the it takes a long time and that's for any service center that Toyota has not only this branch.<//text>< gmap_id>

EXCELLENT service and attention!!! I know i don't have to worry about my car having any issues because Jeremy completely takes care of my car and keeps it running smoothly even after 200k miles. I would highly recommend coming here and asking for Jeremy, he's honest and really takes the time to explain everything to you regarding your vehicle and isn't out to take advantage of you like other places and people. All in all I'm a very happy and satisfied customer and car owner.</Review>

< Review>
My first experience with your service was when our new 1992 Camry was due for first service.  This was in Toyota on south Garey in Pomona.
This was followed by service for new models every 4 years until 2008 when we bought our Highlander Limited with navigation disk, etc.  This model has been so comfortable and enjoyable we have continued to enjoy it.  Helen Kassel was our service advisor during the time she was at Claremont Toyota.  When she left Mr. Suit was our advisor, but he left a short time later and we met Tony Sanchez and we are very, very happy to have him as our advisor.  He  goes above and beyond to serve his clients.
Our 25 years of loyalty is the same as Claremont Toyota is 25 years of loyalty to its customers.
Tony Sanchez is the face of Claremont Toyota.  The "go to guy" to get things done right.  He is EXCELLENT.</Review>

<review>My experience is always great.  Jeremy Wright is awesome.  He takes the time to listen and give advice.  He's always on top of his game.  The wait time varies but not too much.  Always goes by pretty fast.  This place is very efficient and though with inspection and everyone is very friendly.  They make you feel like family. Claremont is my go-to Toyota dealership.

< Review>
Really disappointing!  My husband and I spent the entire day on and off the phone yesterday with a sales rep, she ran our credit, verified income, etc etc over the phone because we live about 2 hours away from this particular dealership.  We had a very specific car in mind, we were very honest about less than perfect credit and minimal down payment but our high verifiable income.  She promised us none of this would be an issue and she would get us into the exact car we wanted with no problems!  So we drove the 2 hours and she showed us the exact car we wanted right when we got there... saying she may not be able to get us into this particular vehicle but something very similar, so we looked at similar cars as a backup.  Test drove, loved it, got our hopes up, we were told that there would be no problems and that the deal would happen! She begins talking to her manager and trying to work the deal and he rudely comes over and basically tells us the deal will never happen unless we can come up with triple the down we had planned on and originally told her was our max! We made it clear the prior day that we didn't want to waste our time or gas money if the deal was not possible and we were assured that it would not be an issue.  WE WERE VERY CLEAR and up front via phonecall about what we could afford and all the time we were dragged in by lies and BS, and left with no deal, feeling beyond disappointed and wasting an entire day, 4 hours of drive time, and $80 bucks in gas for NO reason! False promises and lies.  Even if I could come up with the down they wanted, I'll take my money elsewhere.  I don't like or appreciate dishonest, unethical salesmen.< /Review>

Front desk service was good. They were quick to enter details and creating job for maintenance.
But useless to requesting for drop off. Almost waited for 1 hour still they didn't find any shuttle. Rather I could wait and pickup my car if they finish their job on my car as promised 1.15 hour time.< /Review>

<Review>Claremont Toyota was the absolute best for purchasing/leasing a car. Professional, knowledgeable, helpful, and stress free. Luis, Joe, and Ivica made it a pleasurable experience with a lasting impression. I've already recommended them to others and will be sure to continue to give reference to the entire dealership in the future. Also, they have the greatest coffee machine ever, added icing to an already perfect cake!< /Review>< pictures>

I'm usually very wary of dealerships due to past experiences, but because of a good recommendation from a friend, I decided to try Claremont Toyota out and I'm very happy I did. The staff was very courteous and friendly. Dylan made the process easy and pressure free. If you're looking for a good company to do business with that won't just treat you like another customer, I would highly suggest checking these guys out< /text>

I am always impressed with their level of service. Today I came in for my manufacture free oil change, which I wasn't aware it expired.

They told my mother an alarm system was installed and included with the price. Then I saw that she paid extra in the contract and the alarm was not installed at all. She is a senior citizen and trusted them. I had to go there and wait for them to install an alarm that was "installed already".$540.00 alarm money lesson, don't let older people go to this dealer by themselves.<//text>

When making an appointment over the phone told multiple times that shuttle service available & starts running at 7:30. I am ready to go but no shuttle. Shuttles are sitting in the parking lot, but no drivers. Staff at the shuttle service counter doesn’t seem to care about the customer as they are a different department than scheduling who makes promises they can’t keep. Horrible customer service. The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because repairs are typically completed on time.< /text>

I just wanna say how happy I am with my car buying experience from Claremont Toyota! Starting off with Edgar who walked up and introduce himself to me and my wife when we where just walking around the lot looking at trucks. He explained all the options that came with the truck and also explained all the other models they had in the truck I wanted. He was very nice to me and my wife and actually took the time to get to know us and not just pressure us into buying a truck that day. We left that day because our other car was done getting it's oil change but left Edgar my phone number so he can follow up with me. Edgar called me on Saturday afternoon to see if I was still interested in buying a truck and I told him yes but also asked if they are a part of the Costco auto program which he told me yes and said he would have Peter the fleet sales manager give me a call. Peter called me on Sunday and we where able to get pre approved for the truck i was looking at even before I went down there to start negotiating for the monthly payment i was trying to meet. As soon as I got there Peter and Edgar both greeted me and had the truck ready for me to test drive. We took the truck out for a spin and Peter really got to know me and I really got to know him, he just wasn't trying to make a sale he really had an interest in me as a person. I told him about my bad experience I had at Puente Hills Toyota and how they didn't care about me only about how bad my credit was and they where not trying to work with me at all. After the test drive we went and sat down in his office and and it was the easiest negotiation I have ever done. I was up front and honest with him told peter where I needed to be on the monthly payments and how much I wanted to give as a down payment. He went to his manger to make sure he could give me the deal he was thinking about and when he came back and gave me the numbers I was shocked!!!!! He actually got my payments to the budget I was sticking too. I called my wife to tell her the news and we left with a new truck that night. And my buddy in finance Sal he was the best also made all the paperwork fast and easy for us so we could get out of there. He was also very entertaining and he got to know us as well while we waited.
Peter, Edgar and Sal I just want to say thank you for making my car buying experience easy and fast. You guys really took care of me, you saw past my bad credit and did your all to get me the best deal ever!!! Thank you guys for everything will definitely recommend Claremont Toyota to family and friends and definitely buying my next car there.< /Text>

<text>Best car buying experience I've had. I contacted this dealership through the costco auto program with the car I was looking for, made an appt to come in, and was in and out with a brand new car in under 2 hours. Luis Medina and his team were amazingly friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and courteous. They had the car I was inquiring about pulled up front for me when I got there, showed me all of the features, explained to me the pricing, and kept everything easy and simple. This is how a car buying experience should be - I never felt like I was being "sold" or like I was being ripped off. The finance team was just as incredible - Juan was amazingly friendly and walked me through the process. The fact I was out in 2 hours just topped off this great experience.  Highly recommend.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Claremont Toyota was the absolute best for purchasing/leasing a car. Professional, knowledgeable, helpful, and stress free. Luis, Joe, and Ivica made it a pleasurable experience with a lasting impression. I've already recommended them to others and will be sure to continue to give reference to the entire dealership in the future. Also, they have the greatest coffee machine ever, added icing to an already perfect cake!</text>

<review>Bought a 2018 RAV4 Hybrid XLE & I love it. But more importantly the service I received from my salesman Luis was first class! They say good customer service doesn't exist anymore but the Manager Arturo proved that to be a myth, not only did I get the deal i wanted but they were more then accommodating with my kids as well! When the "negotiations" were so hassle free and simple i thought for sure OK they will get me in the Finance dept WRONG again the finance manager Ramiro made the process seamless and quick! Thank you Claremont Toyota!

< Review>
I had my 10000 service on my Prius.  when I received my car back I noticed that the tires were not rotated on my car,  even though tire rotations are included in the service.   if Claremont Toyota cuts corners on its routine service,  I wonder what else they cut corners on.  makes me wonder if my oil and filter were even changed at all.  I think I will be taking my business somewhere else from now on.</Review>

People are nice especially in the morning. Mid morning they're tired and hungry and it's noticeable. I've brought my car there in the morning at 8am, and about 11am to almost noon and I can tell the difference. They're constantly working, but they still manage to smile.<//Text>

<Review>I bought my Toyota yaris here almost a year ago and Phil made sure my experience was perfect. I got a great price and the salesman who helped me was fast and helpful. Phil also helped a huge amount by giving me details about my car and the services Toyota provides. I highly recommend this dealership!</Review><Name>Adrian Lawson</Name>< gmap_id>

Zupe was outstanding and made us feel welcomed. He went out of his way to fix the recent experience that we had at Claremont Toyota. He along with Miguel and Tony were more than willing to assist with righting the wrong we felt in our initial experience. It was not the ideal situation, but it was evident that they want to provide great customer service. If at first you don't feel like you are being treated the way you want, ask to speak with a manager; they will make it right.<//Review>

The man who helped me three years ago Bennie I believe his name was.. Was fantastic but the financial department didn't explain how it really was. They made it sound like they had my best interest and it was a hard three years. Then it was hard to get rid of it when I was trying to sell it. They didn't give me no support and no help or comfort. I felt alone and stuck. It was such a stressful time and I am just so upset how it all ended.<//Text>

< Review>
Worst Toyota Service ever. Eventhough I called a week ahead and  have  spent more than 15min due the inefficient register process they have, when I arrived today I was not in in the list. The service line was crowded and slow.The  representative told me, as a favor, that he will receive my car instead of being apologized for the mistake. I do regret to have my car serviced here. This is the first time that my car is given back to me  dirtier than when I arrived to the service. I have been said that there is city restriction and they are not longer allow to have car wash as part of the service. Curious because there are lots of car wash around the area. Good excuse to save their money and not have their work done. Sad ocassion. First and last time here. 0 Stars.<//Review>

Took my car in for recall  service and I double check my car for any preexisting damages and on saturday September 1 when I get the car back I notice the knob to move my seat back and forward was hanging off When they returned the car back from the repair I tried calling the service advisor who helped me and no call. Horrible service all through out the day got attitude from the shuttle people and now this. Then I found a pack of gum I had in my center console opened and on my passenger seat.<//review>

<text>FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!! I am very, very, very disappointed at this particular Toyota, I bought my car in 2013 n I’ve always done ALL services w Toyota I had the 2 free yrs n then bought another 2 yrs so this is my 5th yr n the 2 times I went I paid over 100 dlls because they recommended me to get some other stuff my car needed it... so today I went m I just wanted to get my FREE lifetime oil change NOTHING EXTRA I just wanted my FREE (promised) oil change n Jeremy said that in order for me to get it for free I MUST paid 70 dlls for the inspection, that I can’t get a free oil change unless I paid for inspection I was so upset since that’s why I bought my car there because they promise FREE oil change .. they never said I had to pay for an extra service to get it for free. that’s Cheating customers n I will file a formal complaint w the corporation.</text><resp>{'time': 1558050357033, 'text': 'Hello Guadalupe,\n\nWe do apologize for any confusion we may have caused when you purchased your new Toyota.

You go in for a simple oil change and they give you a laundry list of  **suggestions** that your car supposedly needs. My Corolla is in 250K+ miles and never succumbed to anything they said my car needed. All I had fail on me in the past 9 years of ownership is a alternator. So, don't be scared and say yes to whatever suggestion they make. Theie business is not taking car of your car, it is selling you more stuff.</Review>

I've been to other dealerships and the service was not the best. I've been to Claremont Toyota for my last 3 services and my service advisor BERT GONZALEZ is a great guy. Always helpful and friendly. I will only take my cars to him for service!< /text>

As I've waited for my car while being serviced in the past, I've seen the mechanics drive careless and even crash into parked cars, and just last month as I was dropping off my car, while in the public street I noticed a newer white civic type R vehicle driven by one of the mechanics was driving down the street fast and as he came upon a speed bump he slowed down and swerved toward my vehicle where I was unloading my daughter and literally made me toss my daughter back in the car since he came real close to hitting us! and yet he still had the nerve to smirk at me. I later tried to have it reported to management and HR and they just didnt wanna hear it so they pretty much brushed it under the rug. This dealership's name is called "Oh Baby Toyota"...but really dont seem to care about customers and their children's safety! Reason I'm writing this post is to warn people about their Techs and even the Sales People. As a parent I want to advise to keep your children close to you while at this dealership or better yet to be on the safer side leave them at home.

It's been a few months past and you guys telling new employees bout my brother, be more professional and stop making this fake stories especially when no investigation was done. Also after I calle Zupe and no call was return, if DAWN continues telling people bout this false accusations and they are false mainly with no investigation was done, I will sue you this company for slandering my character. Stop telling I threatened your foreman and that a gun was involved. Company is so unprofessional. Instead of doing a proper investigation you easily fired my brother for reporting to HR and did nothing to the foreman Oscar for nearly running me and my daughter over just cuz he was a key to the Hogans lawsuit against Toyota winning that $16M must be nice. Oscar twisted my words saying "I was packing heat" when i said "I WAS HEATED" really mad cuz he smirked after scaring me and my daughter when swerving toward us. Like I said continue running this rumors (and I got proof from your coworkers that are still employed with the company, in screenshots) I proceed handling this matter with a lawyer fair warning, just stop it and I do not want to be called after the fact that I post this second review like you guys did the first time.

See it's got new owner...hope you guys straighten up Matthew, Zupe, Dawn and HR and the shop foreman with their lies and trying slandering my character. Noticed how the deleted my comments on IG before dealership was sold by Hogan's. Willing to go and try buying another car from Sales Dept thru Bruce and Steve Sas they have always treated one like a real customer, sorta like a friend or part of the family.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Review>Poor excuse for a Service Department.   I was quoted a repair estimate of $900 to $4000.   I took my vehicle to a local Toyota mechanic who said the same service should run $200 to $300.   When I asked him what could possibly cost $4000 for the repair in question, he was completely stumped.  What's sad is that Claremont Toyota used to have a great service department.   But something has clearly changed.    Take your vehicle and money elsewhere.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1430519004653, 'text': 'Thank You for your comments.

This is THE worst Toyota dealership in So Cal.  They didn't even both to respond to my offer; obviously they don't want to serve customers.

When it's all about the money in one transaction, you've lost sight of what it means to earn loyal customers.

Shame on them.< /review>

Tony Sanchez has been my service go-to guy for the last 8 or 9 years.  I left Crown Toyota because of their terrible service and came to Claremont.  Even though I live outside of your shuttle service, I still prefer to bring my vehicles to you.  Tony provides exceptional service and has always made our visits pleasant.  After getting my 2004 Tacoma serviced with you 9 years ago, we decided to buy our second Toyota, 2011 4 Runner.  Our buying experience was just as pleasant.  Thank you again Tony and Claremont Toyota for your service.  See you again soon.</Text>

I walked in wanting a  Toyota Highlander and 2-5 hours later I drove away with one. The salesman who helped me was very pleasant, knowledgeable and I felt honest. The people who helped me fianance the vehicle were patient and did a great job of explaining my options. When I left the dealership I felt very satisfied. I wioukd definitely recommend Claremont Toyota to anyone looking for great experience to buy a car.< /Review>

<review>Honestly, I’m pretty dissatisfied with every experience I’ve had here. I bought my used Tacoma here about 5 months ago from a salesman who didn’t know how to start the truck, how to drive a stick or what the price was when I said the online advertised price was different. That should’ve been my sign to not deal with this place...

As I bought the truck I was told they’d fill it with gas. They lied.

I was told that along with the extended warranty I bought, that I’d receive free oil changes at this Toyota location. They lied.

I brought it in because it was making a new noise that I felt needed to be addressed. They told me it was a pulley and belt that needed to be replaced. And quoted me $350 to fix it. Even though I had paid for the warranty. I said no. They brought it down to $140 to replace the belt and the rest was “Covered” under my warranty. So I paid 2 grand for a warranty that covers some work. But then they charge me $140 for a belt that costs $25 at the auto parts store?

The people running this place are not trust worthy, they’re out to swindle you and I would absolutely stay away and find a more reputable Toyota dealership. I was never treated this way at Subaru. I’d give 0 stars if I could.

I’ll keep taking my truck here until my overpriced/no good warranty is up. Then I’ll find somewhere else to take my vehicle.< /review><user>116783048294384374013<//user></record>

So, I have to do myself. Moreover, I have engine oil pressure low, and I just changed the oil last two weeks, so I told the dealer the problem, they tell me to do diagnosed test again, and they changed the oil for me. After one month, the message pop up on my car again and again, so I watch the youtube channel to figure out what's wrong. So I decide to open my oil cap to check the oil level. And what shocking me is the oil level is very low and smell like burning, it is dark oil. But I just changed the oil two times in two months. I don't have any proof about being ripped off. I just recommend you guys becareful on this dealer, they not care for customers, all they do is take as much money as they can. God knew it!<//review>< pictures>

<review>I go here to get my oil changed and generally it is adequate service, but every once in a while you get poor service, which is why 3 stars.  The last time I went they didn't fill up my washer fluid, and I am reminded every time I get in my car what a pain that is.  The simple little things, and yet they sometimes mean the most.< /review>< pics>

Took in our Prius for service and Tony Sanchez made the experience pleasant. Not only was it done right but we didn't feel like we were overcharged. Tony kept us informed of the progress as things changed and was very courteous and knowledgeable.</text>

< review>
Brandon Martinez was helping us out when buying 2 cars from them. Car buying is a tough process we know. But he got very rude and disrespectful and got aggressive saying “ I never talk this long to the customer I’m already getting frustrated” ! He was very aggressive and we were already at the point to move foward and buy the 2 cars when he started saying things like, “ you are not even appreciative of what I have done today”. We were negotiating that’s what car buying is about. We felt disrespected and not safe that we had to stop all the process and leave at that moment. We have always purchased Toyota and now will never consider coming back due to this horrible experience. I was with my family excited to be in our new cars but now we left with nothing due to this employee with horrible customer service and aggressive attitude. I will make sure that no one in my friends and family ever returns here.</review>

<review>I visited the dealership over the weekend. Spoke with a sales guy name Robert who was very helpful. He showed us their camry and corolla selection which was what we were looking for. We talked over the pricing then got a quote. After I do some more research and comparing, I would not mind doing business with them</review>< pics>

I went today to ask for the check back and give the cash in person all to my surprise they deposited the check since TUESDAY the day I gave it to them. Now I have overdraft fee's don't trust them they do not keep their word and this is NOT the way people do business.

This is regarding their service department. I had an appointment for a 10,000 mile service on my Camry.  When I pulled in, I told the tech I was short on time and asked about how long it would be.  She told me the service manager could tell me about how long it would take and took my paperwork into the service manager's area and put it in the inbox for one of them.  I took a seat and waited  and waited and waited--around 20-25 minutes for the service manager to finish flirting with the woman ahead of me. Customers would come in and be seen by a service manager in short order.
The other managers would just walk by and look at me but not one offered to help.  Finally, I got up and left.  I asked for my keys and they brought my car around.  I took my car to another garage where I was in and out in less time than it took for me to wait for the service manager  to finish up with his customer.  Needless to say I will never take my car back to Claremont Toyota for servicing.  This is the worst "customer service" I have ever experienced--even for a dealership!</Text>

< Review>
Not a good visit. Bought car there 2 weeks ago. The alignment was off. Since it was Sunday they said bring it back. Made appt for today, my day off, at 2. When I got there they said it would be 4 hours before they could get it taken care of. I live to far for a ride so I would have to sit there the whole time. For a 15 minute fix! I spent alot of money for the car! Seems like they would be anxious to fix the problem that was noted when the car was purchased! So they rescheduled for 2 weeks, my next day off, and u need to come early and leave it, for an alignment! Never going back there for service again once they right this problem.<//Review>

<text>I walked in wanting a  Toyota Highlander and 2-5 hours later I drove away with one. The salesman who helped me was very pleasant, knowledgeable and I felt honest. The people who helped me fianance the vehicle were patient and did a great job of explaining my options. When I left the dealership I felt very satisfied. I wioukd definitely recommend Claremont Toyota to anyone looking for great experience to buy a car.< /text>< gmap_id>

<text>To start I'm not angry with my sales person Jacob. He was a great guy and did his best to help out. What I am upset about is the craziness my wife and I went through with fiance basically we bought our car on a Saturday evening while it was raining that said 4 5 days later finance still did "NOT" have us approved and I was told that California is an on the spot delivery state. To me this seemed to be sloppy as if they could not get a valid approval from a bank the car would need to be returned. My wife and I eventually went to our credit union and get our own financing as Claremont was dragging their feet on the matter.

To continue a couple days after the sale I discovered issues with the vehicle and I had to take it back to them. Except for the touch screen radio as it was verified as non functional all my other concerns were dismissed after the radio was supposed to be repaired. Day after getting the car back I noticed that the AM FM radio was non functional it was just static, so I called the dealership again and was told that I could NOT go to service that id have to discuss with their used car department. I found this to be stupid as I had just gotten the car back from service. I tried calling their customer relations manager a guy named ZUPE (nice enough guy) but he did not call me back in a timely manor. So I went to a radio shop I trust their tech called me over to show me that there were missing screws from the radio and that the antenna was NOT connected. So I just had that radio shop replace the screws and replace the Toyota factory radio with something better entirely.

After this I got a email from Claremont Toyota about how my purchase experience was and besides the sales man Jacob I did not give them good feedback and this prompted ZUPE to finally get back to me which I found very interesting.

This place is amazing for the initial sales experience then is a ghost no where to be found after the fact. I would suggest going to a more reputable dealer like Longo Toyota or Crown Toyota before going to these people

Another interesting fact they sold me a car which anywhere else would have been sold as a Certified Toyota used vehicle but nope not this place as the used Ceritfied program was too expensive for them which is the answer I was given by their Customer relations manager ZUPE when I asked him about it.< /text><Response>None< /Response><Time>1552676387437< /Time><Pics>None< /Pics><rating>1< /rating>< gmap_id>

I have taken my new and used cars (86, MR-S) to this location and they definitely go above and beyond. Not anything reliability-wise has been necessary outside of routine maintenance, however, I wanted to commend ASM Jacob Narasky and CRM Zupe who have been awesome in helping me with a unique situation where I could have easily seen another dealership not try their best and instead charge the customer, in this case, for another set of $200+ keys.

I also notice they tend to finish their repairs earlier on schedule, and sometimes it's completed by the time it was originally scheduled to be looked at. Thanks for taking care of my rides.< /text>

I abhor dealing with any type of auto mechanic. So, when my 2010 Corolla started making a rattling noise while it was idle - I cringed at the thought of taking it to get serviced.

I was pleasantly surprised, however, to be met by a friendly face - Dylan. He was an awesome liaison between me and the mechanic. He explained everything thoroughly and efficiently - and didn't try to sell me on any other work that "needed" to get done.

I only ended up needing the exhaust heat shield tightened and was out of there in no time.

I will definitely be back for future service  :)</review>

I should have stopped giving this place my time and hard earned money the first time I went but dummy me kept going! About 10 years ago my husband and I went and a ****** sales man asked my husband if he really had a social security! First racist comment! But I wanted a sequoia so bad we overlooked and purchased one getting a lifetime service! Well that lifetime oil change has costed us sooooo much time and stressed! Each time we go we (10 years!!) we wait hours!! With an appointment!!!!! They are rude when I try to complain or ask why sooo long and I see my car parked in the same place for hours and they insist it’s not done, now I even wonder if they do anything to it! Last time!!

Went to go look at cars and could not have any peace to do so. In less than two minutes, we had three sales persons breathing down our necks. We told them if we had any questions or needed assistance we would let them know. I can't stand dealerships that the sales representatives act like dogs in heat. Very annoying. Will never go back with sales tactics like that<//text>

It's not too bad. The prices were a little high. I went in with a check engine light, needing brakes and an oil change. They took care of 2 of 3. I paid 115.00 to get my check engine light off, but it's still on after I left. So, now I'm waiting to take it back to really take care of the problem. $800 later... please just fix my car.<//review>

<Review>A truly exceptional sales experience! Momo and Edin proved to be two of the finest salespeople we've ever dealt with in our car buying experience. They answered all of our questions and offered their expertise and advise in a no pressure manner. They treated us with kindness and utmost professionalism. We completed our transaction in a reasonable amount of time and walked away with a great deal. Thanks again Momo and Edin!!!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c331f0f867730f:0xe1438d5499139ad0<//gmap_id></record>

I was not told what they were going to give me for the trade, just that it was a lease, and did not matter.  (Honestly).... why would that not matter1). I told them I wanted to keep my payment under $150 and left with a $270 payment for (3) years.

I came in to look at a used car with Claremont and was helped almost immediately. Unfortunately the car had sold, but Jae and Raffi were only too helpful to find out some other options to get me into another car.

Unfortunately, I had little time to find a new car and impulsively bought a Corolla XSE hatchback that I had done little research on and bought it without walking away and considering the size of the car being too small for me. One of the worse mistakes any car buyer can do. A week later I took it back to the dealership to see what my options were to exchange the car. While Raffi and his sales team tried to make options that would work for me, I was going to lose quite a substantial sum of money on the sale and decided not to go through with exchanging the vehicle and buying another.

Jae and Raffi followed up to see what else could be done but kindly I thanked them for there time and decided to keep and pay off the car.

Would recommend this dealership with there kindness and service. Unfortunately, I was the one that made the mistake and they did there best to help me out of a poor car buying decision.< /review>

The people you have at Claremont Toyota is what sets it apart from other Toyota dealers.  Bruce Wright, Ricky Hernandez and Bert Gonzalez are three reasons why I will continue to make the long commute from Burbank to Claremont for all my Toyota service and purchase needs.</Text>

If you go to Claremont Toyota make sure you ask for Eric Mckenzie. He is one of the most honest and fair salesman I meet in my search for a car. He wont pressure you to buy or rush you out of the door if you just want to look.<//review>

False advertisement on coupons!
They inflate the price and then they pretend to apply the  discount.
Be ware!
I called  twice to ask about transmission  oil change and they Gave me  a price and they never mentioned was already discounted.

I brought my car in for service the other day and ended up needing to order a part.  Dylan was very helpful with giving me an accurate time line and cost of my repairs. I didn't bring my car in for maintenance before, but i am going to now and im bringing it straight to Dylan.<//Text>

<review>I wish I could give 5 star, the service was fast but also not reliable, I went there to do my oil change yesterday, the second day I found out that my drive way has so many oil, but my car is 2015, this can't happened. So I went down for checking the leak, I found out that my oil drain plug was not even tightened, I can even turn it lose by my hand. That's unacceptable, just wish those mechanics can treated their job more seriously.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Be ware!
I called  twice to ask about transmission  oil change and they Gave me  a price and they never mentioned was already discounted.

<Text>Would give 0 stars if I could. My parents bought 2 vehicles from this dealership. One in 2004 and another in 2007. Today my dad and I took one of the vehicles to the service dept to get a routine free lifetime oil change. We were told twice by two different advisors Danny and Oscar Vergara that "we cannot find any record in your vehicle being bought here." Although we have had multiple expensive repairs done on both vehicles we were told "come back with the receipt and we will update our system showing you bought the car here." Seriously? I said, "You want us to go all the way home, find the receipt from 2004 and bring it all the way back just so you can update your system?!" I looked at my dad and said, "You know what we don't need to bring the car here, we can go somewhere else." When my dad told him we planned on leaving the car over the weekend so there is no rush for repairs the advisor rolled his eyes. What ever happened to customer service? Going out of the way to make the customer happy? Especially a repeat customer who's daughter planned on buying her next car from there but no thanks.
My dad already talked with your Customer Relations Manager who made things even worse as we were told that you guys took our vehicles out of the system since they were deemed as "old data." Maybe you should think twice before doing that. Train your employees to look into the "Toyota National Database" before assuming that we are liars trying to get a free oil change! Very obnoxious and poor service. I expect better service as a repeat customer of 10 years! Won't be returning.< /Text></record>

I reached out to Dan Coscia, the Service Manager, but I have received no response so I feel I should share this experience.   I requested for, when I dropped the vehicle off, to do a ride with a technician to show them the issues. I was told no by the service department, and if they needed help replicating the issue, they would have me come back. Instead, I never got the opportunity, and was told that it was documented as operating as designed. So I had to pick up a vehicle that still had the issues on it, and was not allowed to show the technician what is going on with the car. On top of that, the shuttle service would not pick me up at 4:30 p.m., which caused me to have to take a lyft, costing me $27 to get back to Toyota. Also, my car was not washed either.  Both Toyota of Orange, and Puente Hills Toyota washed my vehicle after every service, and warranty repair. So, I wasted hours of my time, and $27, only to get no service of any kind. I highly recommend going to another Toyota dealership if you want good, helpful service.<//Review>

I went here for routine service on the family van, I did not buy a car from here. People were friendly. -1 star for an uncomfortable waiting area. It is just a plain room with no carpet, three circular tables and about 10 chairs. The kids area was a tiny room with two toys. If there were more than two kids, they would be arguing over the toys.  Longo Toyota is a wonderland compared to this.  No food or drink available with the exception of two vending machines.

The service and efficiency was good overall.< /text>

<Review>On our way home after seeing some 2013 Highlanders's at other dealerships, On a whim, my wife suggested we stop at Claremont Toyota. I was reluctant, then Changed my mind. We were greeted by Margarito , we had a little rough start between us. Margarito is just plain awesome. Very patient, not pushy and very knowledgeable about vehicles. This gentleman is just great. We came home with a great 2013 Highlander V6 PLUS SE. It was and is exactly what we were looking for. The price was right and it was a win for both sides.
Thank You Margarito.

I always have a good experience here. I had trouble with a tire and even tho I didn't have warranty Zupe found a way to get the tire covered and get it done. Wow he was amazing and he was amazing with my kids. Zupe will always do all he can do make everyone happy, such a great person. And when I bought our car Bijan and Raffi helped, they worked so hard to get us the best deal even tho it was hard because we were upside down in our previous car. Every time I go in Bijan will always do all he can. These people are good people and will go over and beyond for their customers. I can keep going.. But this is getting pretty long. So I end with this.. I recommend Bijan,Zupe, and Raffi. If I can give them more stars I would. Thank you guys for all that you guys do for us.< /review>

Parts department is terrible. They only have 1 parts person working at any given time and the wait time to get anything is over 15 minutes. Whenever I come to this toyota for parts the service is not good and the waiting is the worst just standing in line not being told I will be right with you or ask if I would like some water or anything !<//text>

<name>Joshua Wrye< /name>< Review>
I recently purchased another vehicle from Claremont Toyota. When I came in for my first "free" oil change, they explained to me that a couple of years ago they stopped offering "free lifetime" oil changes. Now, in order to get a "free" oil change, you have to purchase the basic service ($54/avg.) first.

I understand times are tough for everyone and all businesses, but this type of service was one of the main reasons I was so loyal to Claremont Toyota.

After talking to the maintenance manager about this issue, he offered me two $10 vouchers to Wahoo's Tacos and basically told me, "sorry, but that's just the way it is now" and "your salesman should've explained it to you better." Um, yeah, he should've told me that things had changed since the last time I purchased a vehicle here.

Even so, I'm still a fan of Claremont Toyota. The other day I went in to purchase some parts for our car and the parts guy applied all of the current coupons even though we didn't have them with us (his name is Pete). Thanks, Pete, for keeping us happy!< /Review>

< review>
Im giving this review from my last experience: on Friday July 6, I went to the dealer to get a normal oil change. It was 5:30pm when I get there, a service employee (which I didnt get his name) came out from the office asking me what did I want. I said I came for an oil change. He said that all his lube crew already went home and there's no one to perform the job that I request. I said to him that on google, and the claremont toyota website say that you guys close at 7pm. He said that there's nothing he can do about it, when I saw a mechanic working in a truck. He ended up declining the job and I left the dealer. This is for the employees at Claremont Toyota: if you guys have a schedule and don't follow it, update your services hours or let the crew until the schedule time.</review>

<Text>When we came into the dealer the seller didn't even know were the car we wanted to see were at. When we came into to talk about the car we wanted the seller left us their Inside the dealer. Then the manager came in to talk about the car we talked for a couple of minutes and then he answered a call and left us their for 30 minutes. We left from the dealer and bought a car at Nissan of Montclair and we bought a car named kicks. That Nissan dealer treats you so well that you will leave that dealer with a nice car. If you want to get a good car and good mileage and fast go to the dealer at Nissan of Montclair. Don't go to Toyota from Claremont  they will treat you like garbage and have no feelings to sell you a car. Cold blooded people at Toyota. NISSAN Of Montclair have the most warming sellers I have ever met and have feelings to sell cars that you want.

When I arrived at Claremont Toyota  center I was Immediately helped and a gentleman by the name of Oscar  was very helpful and helped me to take care of my repairs, I must say that  he took care of everything  and got the repairs to my car done on time he was very attentive and very professional this is the reason that I drive miles from where I live because of the excellent service that your service depth has and I will continue do do so in the future my wife and I have purchased two cars from Claremont  Toyota and we will continue to deal with Claremonth Toyota and the great service depth. Thanks again,  Floreal Alvarez</Text>

<Review>Parts department is terrible. They only have 1 parts person working at any given time and the wait time to get anything is over 15 minutes. Whenever I come to this toyota for parts the service is not good and the waiting is the worst just standing in line not being told I will be right with you or ask if I would like some water or anything !<//Review>< Date>

< Review>
I used to take my 09 Corolla to crown Toyota but they were too busy to take me in as a walk-in for an oil change so I googled close toyotas and decieded to try Claremont Toyota. I was assigned to Jeremy Wright. He contacted me after they inspected my car and recommended additional service. Jeremy explained all the work to me in lots of detail. After talking with him I felt comfortable with the additional services. I was so happy and will be back to see Jeremy! GREAT JOB JEREMY!< /Review>

My new car purchase felt like I was at a five star restaurant.Calvin once again delivered over and beyond with exceptional service.

This is our second car from Claremont Toyota. We will continue to refer all of our friends and family to Calvin. When he quotes a payment on the specific model and color weinquired about, That is exactly what you get.

Being in and out in less than an hour really did it for me. As a full time Realtor  I hardly find the time to shop for myself.

Thanks a million Calvin I deserved a New 2017 Camry.

I was here to purchase a vehicle with my girlfriend and ended up also purchasing one for myself at the same time. This is some of the best service I've ever seen at a dealership from start to finish. Jean Carlos handled the sale of both vehicles and we couldn't have been happier, I didn't even feel like I was buying a car, such phenomenal service I can't even say enough. Also, the final paperwork process with Natasha was such a breeze! This is when most dealers try to slide things by you! Natasha was so sweet and professional, I'd highly recommend Clermont Toyota over David Maus any day of the week! Do yourself a favor and purchase your next car from here. From sales to the GM and final paperwork process, you'll be happy you did!<//text>

<Review>I am sorry I never had to deal with a dealership that is like Claremont Toyota. I have bought from many others. Honda, Ford, Audi Mercedes lamborghini Ferrari etc... and never have I had to leave with anything less than a full tank, and in addition not even oem tires as Bridgestone or pirreli that came with the car. Instead some cheap Chinese’s 25 dollar tire that will put my son at risk on the road and in addition only one key. All I know you guys reprogrammed and sold my key 2nd key. I have no confidence in Toyota as a company if this is how it's dealers represents the brand. Also btw I haven’t received a registration yet and it’s been over 3 weeks.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<text>I took my car to service July 5 I told the person who recive me to check one of the tires because the air pressure was often lowered.The tires were rotated but they did not check me that I had a big nail and put it in front rigt side That day I traveled to Las Vegas .It was very dangerous because my family was with me. I am angry and worried because my wife and my son take the car with you for service. I hope it is not normal for Claremont toyota< /text>< Pics>

<Review>I was ready to buy a car with cash. I had already made a deal with the manager. We had agreed to a price. I was signing the papers when I looked at the price. It was more that they had offered at the beginning. I spoke with the manager and he told me that there had been a confusion but that they could arrange a payment plan to pay the extra money they were charging me. I was mad. I left the place and decided to buy a car somewhere else. These people are greedy and they try to trick people. Do not buy your car here.

I was glad I looked at the paper before signing. They trick people here. Look at what you sign people!!!< /Review>< rate>

We went in and had the best experiance. Rueben, the sales person, was great. He was very accommodating,very friendly and went above and beyond. Once we chose our vehicle, we were very well taken care of by Ven the finance guy. He was very knowledgeable and explained things thoughtfully and thoroughly. The best service we have received at any dealership we have gone to. Thank you for the wonderful experiance and excellent service! We love our new 4runner!< /Review>

After car shopping for several years(yes several years) we came across a the best salesman that would make our buy the best. Riley was caring, understanding, a great listener, and better yet and individual who was passionate. We couldnt thank his boss enough either. After some troubled credit, he was able to get the deal done and even better then the organize one that was given.

I have been to many service shops all over Nevada and California, and whenever my car needs servicing I always dread it because I can't stand dealing with these rude employees, but Dylan Quiring will forever be my go to service guy from here on out!! Such a kind and understanding person who is very interested in fixing any of your problems!!! DYLAN QUIRING is the go to guy, I was 100% satisfied with my experience with him. Thank you Dylan!!<//Review>

<Review>Went in for my Prius'  scheduled maintenance.  We own 4 cars and each one has its own function.  My Prius is the only car I take to the dealer to get serviced because 1) I live 2 minutes away and 2) I always get exceptional service from Phil Tarin and everyone else involved with servicing my car for whatever maintenance/issue(s) need attention.

Phil is friendly, helpful and professional and he takes the time to explain what service will be performed . . .  he makes bringing in my car actually enjoyable!  I always leave confident and satisfied of the service I receive from Claremont Toyota and I will definitely keep coming back!< /Review><user>106778267257657646977</user>< Response>

This is our second car from Claremont Toyota. We will continue to refer all of our friends and family to Calvin. When he quotes a payment on the specific model and color weinquired about, That is exactly what you get.

Being in and out in less than an hour really did it for me. As a full time Realtor  I hardly find the time to shop for myself.

Thanks a million Calvin I deserved a New 2017 Camry.

<Text>we had a wonderful experience working with Calvin. i did buy a Rav 4 and discovered as I was leaving that there was a small crack in the windshield. I live hours away and they did send a repairman to my home to look at it however it could not be repaired. So i have to take the car back to Claremont for a new windshield. Not perfect but they will pay for my gas and I'm heading to 1000 oaks that day anyways... I'll keep you posted!

OK so everything worked out perfectly. A big thank you to ZUP for handling all the details and making me one happy shopper!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<Review>Very rude and manipulative sales people. Straight up lied to me about what I would be getting. Harassed me over the phone because I hadn't provided them with my last pay stub even though they said I could bring it the next week (which was when I was getting paid). Literally yelled at me on the phone and threatened to call the police. I tried to take the car back and they said they didn't want to take my car (but you want to call the police okay....) eventually had to request an early pay stub from my boss. They are such insensitive liars here. Go to Glendora they are much nicer.< /Review><Rating>1<//Rating>< Pics>

<text>Very bad service. I gave them my Camry, which was still under warranty and mentioned that it has currently three issues, they solved none. I was working with Jeremy. He is very rude. I asked for the supervisor, he said he does not have one. No one else in the dealer was responding and everyone was ignoring the fact the they have not done anything to the car after having it for two days. They told me to go the another day before 4pm to talk to the technician. I went there at 3, and the technician had already left (knowing that I will come to see him).
Overall, I can say that I will never go back there.<//text>< name>

I took my Scion in to Clarendon Toyota for service, and Phil Tarin went above and beyond the call to get my requirements met. I would recommend that you contact Phil Tarin at Claremont Toyota for ALL of your service needs.< /Review>

I was very happy purchasing my Toyota Prius. Great service from the beginning.  I Actually felt bad for shopping my rate but had to make sure I was getting the best interest rate. I first got a financing quote from Steve Saad. I then went to talk to BOFA.  I was flat out shocked and upset at the quote I got from BOFA considering the funds I have with them and my business accounts and years with them. Coming back to talk to Steve was no biggie and in fact he was still asking for and wanting my business.  I can't thank Steve Saad enough for going to bat for me...Hard. The final papers were signed with Luis Medina also a very good experience and took the time to go over everything again. Oh Baby for life. Thanks Guys.<//Text>

< Review>
Went in for my Prius'  scheduled maintenance.  We own 4 cars and each one has its own function.  My Prius is the only car I take to the dealer to get serviced because 1) I live 2 minutes away and 2) I always get exceptional service from Phil Tarin and everyone else involved with servicing my car for whatever maintenance/issue(s) need attention.

Phil is friendly, helpful and professional and he takes the time to explain what service will be performed . . .  he makes bringing in my car actually enjoyable!  I always leave confident and satisfied of the service I receive from Claremont Toyota and I will definitely keep coming back!</Review>

< Review>
I went to purchase a Prius 2017 and they wanted $530 a month even when I qualify for  0% apr then the managers were rude when I told them it did not make sense when they were going to discount the price and give me the Costco program price they do not even destroy your information if you don’t buy from them but luckily I got my ss under lifelock in case something weird goes on i will be called in case someone tries to use my information.<//Review>

<review>The shuttle service is horrible the first time i used the shuttle when i took my vehicle for service the woman Araceli left me waiting for an hour after i told her i was going to wash my hands when i returned she had the driver take another client abd i had to wait another thirty minutes. That was the first time the second time i gave the address to the woman Araceli to where i wanted to be dropped off when the driver was taking me he asked where i was going to be dropped off i gave him the address abd he said for me to tell him how to get there i told him i didn't kniw and he started to tell me how was it i did not know how to get to my job i told him to use the navigator. He said he didn't have one abd kept on and on i was telling him i did not want to argue but he kept on and on. He was so mad that he abruptly braked and made a U turn in the middle of the street making my body jerk back and forth . if you do not know how to get to where yiu are going don't get the shuttle plan for someone to pick you up.<//review>< rating>

I don't normally write reviews, but I had to make the exception for Sam cherri. Without a doubt, Sam was the most helpful, patient, and genuinely caring salesman I have ever encountered.

I was inquiring about a scion FRS that was not at this particular location. However Sam went the extra mile LITERALLY to get the car for us. This took all day unfortunately and we felt absolutely terrible for taking away his whole working day just for us.

If you are a serious buyer,  I recommend Sam cherri. He will work until you are 100% happy.

Thank you Sam.<//Text>

The person who assisted me seemed to be in a bad mood since it was so busy. I told him I'd come back another day instead. With that bad experience in mind I chose to go to Claremont Toyota on a different day off & I'm glad I did. I was immediately greeted by an employee named Sergio Cabuto. He was friendly and inspected my car rather quickly and sent my car to be serviced. It was a much better vibe at Claremont.<//text><user>101804772540470432102</user>< Gmap_id>

Purchased TPMS sensor due to tire light.  Sensor cost nearly $90.  Took to tire store and had installed.  Tried to reset light and nothing worked.  Went back to the dealer and asked parts why.  They told me that it may need programming, talk to service.  Went to service and they told me $125 to program the part that we just paid nearly $90 for.  Went to a local tire store and they programmed the sensor in less than 3 minutes free of charge!!!!!!  GO GOUGERS! BOOH HISS TO TOYOTA FOR MAKING THEM SO COMPLICATED AND BOOH HISS TO CLAREMONT TOYOTA $125 FOR A 3 MINUTE JOB ON A PART THAT WAS JUST PURCHASED FROM THEM!  GROSS<//text>

Don't buy any of thier used non-Toyota  cars from these salesmen. Free oil changes for life ain't really free they weren't able to provide the parts for a oil change so it put me down 58 bucks compared to Jeffy lube 70 bucks. Their 24,000 mile warranty cost me $2,600 +interest & tax. Thier service and mechanic department get 5 stars thou including their shuttle driver. At the end of the day i regret buying thier warranty, I'll buy a extended warranty elsewhere once the current is going to expire.<//Review>

Was there today and like it said in the previous comments...

Make SURE you'll get a spare key at least (cuz right before you sign the contract they'll tell you that'll only come in one and its $500 each.

Make sure the remote/alarm system included in the dawn payment and if not they'll tell you that's its $900 extra before you sign the contract

Make sure you catch the registration tag on the car cuz they'll make you pay for the registration (heck they'll even make you pay for a spare tire)

Wanna live longer? Don't go there, you'll waste 4 hrs from closing the deal and loose 10 years of your lifetime from emotional disturbance they'll cost. GOOD thing I DID"T get a car from them.</review>

I came here with my friend who was looking for an FRS that was on a good price for 21k for 20k miles, so everything was going fine until we got what was either racism and being stereotyped. We speak perfect English and the guy helping us (not to pull the race card) but he ends up sending us someone who was speaking nothing but Spanish because "he speaks your language I can't really help". To add on to this we ignored it because the guy helping us was trying to low ball my friend telling him that his payments were around the 500 range when my friend was aiming for 350-380 in payments zero down (but wait there's more!) this douche kept ranting how he couldn't afford it when HE DID NOT EVEN RUN HIS CREDIT YET ! (My bud has great credit for his age 20, 680something to be correct with a 2-3 year history for credit). I got mad so when the douche left the other guy who couldn't help us asked how it was going and I told him he's already telling us we can't afford it when he hasn't even run his credit! So another guy steps in and seriously tries to play the low ball game too then went to run his credit this time and the price dropped but they were still trying to take whatever cent they could from him and talking to him like he is a joke. Im glad my friend walked out on them when they got their hopes up thinking they made the sale thinking he fell for it. All I say is if you have good credit and you are young, depending on who is taking care of you plays a key to finding a car, and beware these guys will belittle you without even knowing your credit score! (Muhammed was the pushy one, and Pablo was the one belittling my friend without even knowing what his real credit score was.) I know damn well they could've done better for him if it was someone else assisting us.< /review>

<Review>My boyfriend and I recently went in to have our car serviced and at first it seemed as if we were going to have trouble getting services based on our warranty. I must have had a flustered or frustrated look on my face because, Phil Tarin,  the service advisor who was helping us took over and figured out the issue quite quickly. Unfortunately since we didn't have an appointment and the technicians were unavailable at the time we weren't able to stay. But Phil was amazing, not only did he walk us through what was covered under the warranty - he explained about other possible fees and put us at ease with our concerns. He also took the time to make an appointment that worked best with our schedules since we have to share a car. To boot, it was a pretty busy day in the service department but we felt like all the attention was on us. Contrary to some of the negative comments about this dealership and the service department we had a great experience and will gladly refer our friends and family here (especially when it's time to get their cars serviced, we'll refer Phil Tarin all day long).<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

I just purchased my second car from Claremont Toyota .
2 and a half ago years ago Raffi Hatter helped  me into my Camry lease and it was the easiest car leasing experience I have ever had! I was so impressed that I came back to Raffi again for the New year! If you want to work with a polite, relaxed, no-hassle, straightforward, no hidden tricks salesman then Raffi is your man!  I was ready to move up to a bigger car in the new year but wasn't sure I could afford it - Raffi and sales manager Dave Canova did everything in their power the make this upgrade possible for me and I couldn't be happier with my new 2016 Avalon. Nester Beltran was a great help he showed me all of the bells and whistles with my new Avalon. Thanks again guys you made this possible for me and I will be coming back!< /review>

Don't buy from this dealership if you expect them to honor a price they quoted you over the phone. "Textbook" salesmanship is exactly what you'll get as it was in my case. I got an over the phone price from Angel "salesman" and Carlos "finance" for 42k OTD price, Tundra Crewmax.  So, I go down there, test drive, fill out some finance paper work and get another guy (didn't get his name) saying they can't honor the price quoted over the phone.... and if I can work with them on it.  If they just honored the price vs begging for more money this would have been a smooth transaction.  My time is very valuable which is why I asked for the bottom line price over the phone to speed up the process. Big waist of time dealing with pathetic salesmen!<//review>

<Review>Gotta admit when I first got my 2015 Toyota Corolla I was super excited was help and was offered many things like the oil change Free of charge after a certain time...
And I got all the coverage they offered me. From paint and tires to electrical and more  every sounded great I took it all being that I've had a previous car that soo much had happened and nothing to cover it so when I was offered all this Stuff  I was excited little did I know  that Everytime I have brought it in I have had to almost argue to get anything cover  four months ago I had  taken my car cause it had a nail in one of the tiers plus needed maintenance left it there all day only to pick it up and  the tier was never looked into...Was  very upset!!!! Then was told to bring it in the next day and that they would take care of it ......It's been 4month and once again I have nails  not one but in 3of my tiers   had nails but that all 4needed to be replaced I ask the guy ok let's do that how much would I have to pay ??? (Again have in mind I have  the warranty for tiers ) the guy said it would be about 5 hundred and something I said well doesn't my warranty cover it ??? He said I don't have anything on file that says ur cover  I was pissed I said please ask whom u need to ask  I'm covered  the guy called me back only to tell me that only 2of the tiers would be cover due to the other ones  were  worn out
And one of them still had a nail on the tier  so I return and ask if they had at least patched the tier they said no I ended up driving away with a nail on my tier shortly after I left also realized they had left another's​ customer key in my car ...... All I can say bad service over all  next Time I buy a car won't be from here ....< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Was there today and like it said in the previous comments...

Make SURE you'll get a spare key at least (cuz right before you sign the contract they'll tell you that'll only come in one and its $500 each.

Make sure the remote/alarm system included in the dawn payment and if not they'll tell you that's its $900 extra before you sign the contract

Make sure you catch the registration tag on the car cuz they'll make you pay for the registration (heck they'll even make you pay for a spare tire)

Wanna live longer? Don't go there, you'll waste 4 hrs from closing the deal and loose 10 years of your lifetime from emotional disturbance they'll cost. GOOD thing I DID"T get a car from them.</review>

<Review>I came here with my friend who was looking for an FRS that was on a good price for 21k for 20k miles, so everything was going fine until we got what was either racism and being stereotyped. We speak perfect English and the guy helping us (not to pull the race card) but he ends up sending us someone who was speaking nothing but Spanish because "he speaks your language I can't really help". To add on to this we ignored it because the guy helping us was trying to low ball my friend telling him that his payments were around the 500 range when my friend was aiming for 350-380 in payments zero down (but wait there's more!) this douche kept ranting how he couldn't afford it when HE DID NOT EVEN RUN HIS CREDIT YET !

Im glad my friend walked out on them when they got their hopes up thinking they made the sale thinking he fell for it. All I say is if you have good credit and you are young, depending on who is taking care of you plays a key to finding a car, and beware these guys will belittle you without even knowing your credit score!

<review>No BS. I was in the market for the new 2017 Tacoma TRD Pro. After calling 22 dealers from ventura county down to pomona and claremont, i got a hold of Raffi Hattar down at Claremont Toyota. We agreed to a price over the phone. a really good one for the truck i wanted which was so hard to find...so i gave a deposit.
I was skeptical the entire month waiting for the truck to get there, ( i dont trust car dealers WHATSOEVER) I walked in to a suprise. Omar took me on a test drive, and helped me out beginning the paperwork.
On paper was exactly what we agreed upon over the phone.  Omar and Raffi really really really impressed me.
Raffi Hattar is a man of his word!!! Gave me a great deal on the truck, Omar was awesome!, and Jaun in financing gave me a deal i would be stupid not to take on an extended warranty even!
Come to Claremont Toyota for your next Toyota and ask for Raffi, Omar, and Juan!
Thanks guys!!!!!!<//review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1472236263560, 'text': 'Hello Alex:  It’s great to hear that your car buying experience was excellent and we are honored that you put your trust in us.

Friendly at first but then,manager calls salesperson and hints to cut you loose when he sees you are not coming in the the finance office.  Very  unprofessional way of  doing business.</review>

<UserId.>116611918994051323259<//UserId.><review>Well after having to deal with BS from crown Toyota I went to Claremont Toyota because one of the sales guy and I have been emailed EACHOTHER and I did my pre application everything he needed I send it over to him. He told me that he can help me to go on in. So I go if course simple as one two three I get a 2016 corolla. Which in leased. I had the car for almost a week when I get a call from the finance company saying they wanted the car back. Again more bs. I went through so much. Was even told to bring car back that they will help me. Here I go again with the finance department. Instead of lease they want me to finance OK great. 500 down, payment 490. Great whatever. Since it was late banks closed I had to leave the car there. Next day I don't hear nothing. Finally another day comesz by I go in back to finance department they want me to put 1700 down for the car. No freaking way. So I told him how about in a cheaper car. Ok yes when can do that. More bs is they will give me a call within one or two days to See what the bank would say on giving me a cheaper car. They said that were here to help u. Yah freaking right. There's more to this but way to much to ride. I make good money and my credit ain't bad. I really think they need to stop letting people drive off with a car especially when it's not for certain they can keep the car getting peoples high hopes up. I went through so much crap. Even went to work 5 hours late for some BS..Toyotas are good cars but the business people there aint. Be up front to the buyers. Think of us as if it was one of ur family members. Without customers u won't have a business and a job. I have nothing good to say about this dealer ship.</review></record></dataset><record>
< review>
wanted to share my thoughts with the google community regarding my experiences.so i have been a long time toyota owner, family members also! been coming to the toyota dealers for service for quite some years now. at first hand i know what to expect. you need this you need that. so the journey begins! back some years ago i met this nice young fellow when i brought my vehicle in for service and check engine light was on! i knew what the check engine light code was. i kindly asked him if he could check it out for me. no problem he replied. after all he said "you are getting a major service done, it's the least we could do for you! so we agreed on leaving my vehicle over night. didn't want a rush job on my vehicle. next morning i get a call for jeremy wright (my service advisor at claremont) he said. he bud i got some good news for you! i was like here we go..the mechanic told him i have a lean code p0171, most likely i would need to have my mass air flow cleaned! recently i had been getting my car service at elmore toyota. that's where jeremy wright had been previously employed, the service advisor at elmore toyota had told me i needed new catalytic converter and was gonna be over $1900 dollars! so we had talked about doing a EFI service and cleaning the mass air flow. he insured to me that its not a service that i would be getting a guarantee. what does that mean? i replied. jeremy explained to me that if what the technician was about to do didn't fix the problem i would not be charged! now that's a guarantee. guess what he was so confident in his mechanic it fixed the problem! that was really good news. he saved me butt loads of money. jeremy wright is a really nice guy, he treated my like i was a brother! do your self a favor save some money and aggravation, go see jeremy!</review>

Me and my wife was looking to a purchase a Prius C. I got referral from a friend that had purchase a vehicle from there. So we went down there and was greeted by a salesman that had no clue about the features of the car. He was just reading off on the sticker sheet. We test drove the car and he ask us how we like it and if we can step into the dealership and make this deal happen. We ran my wife credit and they told us that her credit was okay. We kept on going on the price that we could agree to. Price kept on changing base on her alright credit. They said we can get her on a 1.9 interest rate so they can buy a point from the bank. I actuality anybody in tier one was qualified for that interest rate. We caught them lying and they tried to explain themselves and not answering our questions. We wanted to see her fica score and they wouldn't do it. Finally after 3 hours wasting our time we left upset because they tried to play us with lies. Her fica was 760. The whole entire time they said they couldn't help us because of her credit. A bunch of bs. Thank god we had friend that work at Crown Toyota as a finance manger and he told us to come down and it was smooth sailing from there. Got the car that we want with more bells and whistle. Claremont offer us a crappy base model and we got the better model $1500 less because it was last years model same identical car. Don't shop there. Im in sales myself and treat all my customers with dignity and pride. These people treat you like you were born yesterday. Please BEWARE and buy you car somewhere else.</text>

MANAGER WITH AWFUL BUZZ CUT HEAD huge dude steped in as a "closer"  super aggressive called me and my wife ungrateful in Spanish and made Lil comments like this isn't nordstroms.  My kids where there, real bad feelings and emotions.

A week later we went to longo toyota in El monte.  We picked up a 2013 camry we couldn't be happier awesome staff friendly helpful professional   highly recommend Cassey in used cars dept< /review>< pictures>

Got a letter for recall on my toyota corolla for replacement parts. Dropped off car after they "received the parts" and got a call in less than an hr with manager stating there are more problems with my car and they need to keep it for a certain amount of days.

Wouldn't mind the situation if they offered me a rental car. But I guess someone has to pay for the manufacturer defects and unpreparedness of the company.</text>

<user>111733610394264263944</user><review>We've purchased more than 5 cars within the past 5 years and this dealership is, BY FAR, the MOST Unprofessional, Unhelpful and most laughable sale team, used and new, we have ever encountered.  You're certainly NOT going to survive in my book.  Good luck in earning anyone's business with this sales team.  TO THE OWNER OF THE DEALERSHIP: I'd highly recommend that you conduct a series of customer surveys on your sale people, "supposed" fleet manager or managers because they ARE affecting your business.  Today, we have made our purchase, but at Longo Toyota.  If your team or you, as a dealership, are not confident enough to even try to compete, I highly recommend that you stay away from doing business at all.  EVEN your neighboring dealership, John Elways Toyota of Ontario has far better service and confidence than your team.  Just a thought.  Anyone who's looking to get a great deal in the Inland Empire (Rancho Cucamonga, Upland, Claremont, San Dimas, La Vern, etc.)  Stay away from "Oh~Baby, Woah Baby" Claremont Toyota, because that's just what you'll say on your way out... in disgust.  Oh.  One more thing.  For those who are unfamiliar with Google's rating scale...  It's out of 30.

<Text>They say they are busy when they have no cars in the drive, they could not cover my vehicle under the two year maintenance plan because I was off by a month even though the miles were not over. Aggressive sales that are overpriced. Oscar in service was ok though.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>(Translated by Google) This weekend I went to the dealer because I wanted to see if I could trade in my 2020 Maxda cx5 suv for a 2020 tacoma. I gave the seller all the information and I had to leave because I had to work. The seller told me that he was going to send me a message with the information and if he sent me the message that he needed to give a down payment of $ 2000 to $ 5000 and that my payment per month was $ 830 for 72 months. Which is $ 59,904. I don't know if they just gave me these exuberant numbers just to get discouraged because they won't do business. For me it is not the way to tell someone they do not qualify. It was a bad experience and I will never go to this dealer again.

Este fin de semana fui al dealer por que queria ver si podria hacer trade in mi suv 2020 Maxda cx5 por una tacoma 2020. le di toda la informacion al vendedor y yo me tuve que ir por que yo tenia que trabajar .  El vendedor me dijo que me iva mandar un mensaje con la informacion y si me mando el mensaje que necesitaba dar de down payment de $2000 a $5000 y que mi pago por mes era de $830 por 72 meses. Que son $59.904. No se si solo me dieron estos numeros tan exuberantes solo para desanimarme por ellos no ivan hacer negocio. Para mi no es la forma de decirle a alguien que no califica. fue una mala experiencia y no vuelvo a ir a este dealer.< /text>< pics>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Service attitude is ok, the environment is also very clean, but the maintenance efficiency is not satisfactory! Communication with customers is not enough! From 10:00 in the morning until 5:00 in the afternoon, it is just a general inspection of the car, changing the oil, changing the light bulb, and changing the brake pads of the rear wheel. My wife and I were hungry and tired because we did n’t have a car and the temperature was over a hundred degrees Fahrenheit. The maintenance staff did not inform them in advance that they would have to wait that long. When the maintenance could not be completed in time, they did not take the initiative to contact the customer. It made the customer wait there for almost a whole day, which was really bad.

(Original)
服務態度還可以，環境也很整潔，但是維修效率不及格！與客戶的溝通也不行！從早上十點一直維修到下午五點，就只是一般的檢查車子，換機油，換燈泡，及換後輪的煞車片。我和太太因著沒有車子，外面又是華氏一百多度的高溫，強迫待在那裏足足七個小時，又餓又累。維修人員沒有事先告知需要等那麼久，維修無法及時完成時也沒有主動找客戶溝通，讓客戶在那裏乾等了幾乎一整天，實在是很糟糕。< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I bought a car with them last week I was looking for a 4-cylinder Toyota CRV, the seller sold me to my mother, but one of 6 cylinders, the seller told us that the car was 4 so, my anger was that they were not chisellers for me. It was not good customer service because I feel that they took advantage of us that we were two women that was not good

Compre un carro con ellos la semana pasada yo estaba buscando un CRV Toyota 4 cilindros el vendedor nos vendió a mi a mi mama uno pero de 6 cilindros el vendedor nos dijo que el carro era de 4 so mi enojo fue que no fueron cinceros para mi no fue un buen servicio al cliente porque siento que se aprovecharon que éramos dos mujeres eso no estuvo bien< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) It is the worst experience I have ever had. The guarantee they offer is useless, because in the end it does not cover anything and one has to pay. Do not buy that guarantee because you only lower the oil change and the rest have to pay from your pocket. Also the car I bought a year ago has a noise and they say it has to sound like that. Do not really buy toyota.

(Original)
Es la peor experiencia  que he tenido. La garantia que ofrecen no sirve para nada,  por que al final no cubre nada y uno tiene que pagar. No compren esa garantia por que solo le rebajan el cambio de aceite y el resto lo tienen que pagar de su bolsillo.

(Translated by Google) We are customers of Toyota and we went to the Ontario dealer and they did not treat us well, so we decided to go to Claremont and Angel Lopes attended us and we were treated beautifully by a good agent, personal as you should have so that we are always comfortable. It is the third car we bought from Toyota and in Ontario they gave us a terrible service!

(Translated by Google) I needed to refinance my car to put it under my name and save some money, I went to the refinancing department in Claremont Toyota, Juan Carlos Torres was the person who helped me reach my goals, the attention I received, the options that were offered to me and the exlanation about the process were not only excellent but crystal clear, this guy went straight to the point. If you are willing to save money and understand this process better, then you MUST talk to Juan Carlos at Claremont Toyota.

I have a car that I needed to put in my name, I had bought it with a co-signer ... I went to the refinancing department and Juan Carlos Torres assisted me; The tention I received, the options they gave me and the explanation were excellent as well as very clear and concise, straight to the point.
If you want to save money and understand more about the process, you should visit Juan Carlos at Claremont Toyota.
