A beautiful campus nestled in the garden of La Sierra. A place to live, learn, grow and most importantly change your world.< /review>

<user>104903807048556980009</user><Text>While I wasn’t a student there luckily, I have spent time on the campus and interacted with staff and student. There is zero campus life (which for me is actually prefer) but despite that, I have reason to rate it as low as we can go. Very expensive. Very understaffed. Basically paying to be taught by other students cause all the professors are stretched to thin. I went to events and I thought they hadn’t started yet, only to find out no one ever comes. The education department is the most incompetent and uncaring from what I’ve seen and heard. Seems they are actively trying to screw up the lives of future teachers. When the school closes the community will benefit.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Rating>

While a bit on the pricier side, you really get what you pay for. The staff are all caring and the class sizes are very small.<//text>

Update:

I felt the need to update my review of La Sierra University due to the amount of attention that my original review attained and in order to further clarify certain aspects of my original review.

As a Military Veteran I attended LSU utilizing my GI Bill. At the time of my attendance the campus did not offer a dedicated team or staff member that could tend to the unique requirements of Veterans and requests from the Department of Veterans Affairs in a timely manner. There were many occasions in which I would have to call and remind the representative in charge of the program at that time to certify my attendance at the university in order to receive my financial aid from the VA. On at least one occasion there was a significant lapse in aid as the representative failed to certify my attendance for a significant amount of time. I had to reach out the VA directly and request a financial hardship payment in order to keep up with my bills I had at the time since I had no other form of income during my time as a student there.

Other campuses that I had attended prior to LSU always had a dedicated team of experts to assist Veterans on their higher education journey, even including small community colleges. I did not understand why a university of this size did not have something similar.

Some of the buildings on campus were brand new, including the equipment, and conference halls. Though on the other hand other buildings on campus were rapidly deteriorating to include the very desks and chairs students sat in everyday. On occasion when a student brought this up to a staff member or professor it was explained that although the university does generate a significant income from student's tuition the profits have to be distributed to other sister schools and programs within the organization.

Although the university offered great opportunities for students by providing jobs for them, to include opportunities for recent graduates. Some of the positions these recent graduates filled were counselors and tutors. Thought it is a great idea it failed to address key issues such as being able to reach someone with the proper knowledge of programs, available financial aid, and the ability to approve or deny eligibility for said programs. Being that most of the staff was comprised of student workers there was almost always a bottleneck in order to retrieve correct information or approvals.

You will also be required to attend service at least once a week if you commute to campus. If you are in the dorms I have heard it is up to at least 3 times a week, but I cannot confirm that as I did not live on campus. You need to keep this in mind as this was mandatory and I had plan accordingly. Though it was mandatory not everyone that attended respected the service or even seemed the least bit interested. Often people were sprawled out on the benches taking a nap, talking to one another, or playing on their cellphones and portable video game consoles.

As I understood Loma Linda University is a sister school of LSU so many of the students attending LSU were simply doing so in order to find an easier application path to Loma Linda. Things may have changed since my time there but this was the overall goal of many of my peers.

Ultimately I ended up withdrawing from LSU for the reasons mentioned above as well as others not mentioned. I do not know how significantly things have changed since my attendance but if you're planning on attending this institution I would highly suggest you do your own research and talk to current students on their opinions, especially if you are going to be utilizing your VA benefits to do so.<//Text>

Kind of bothered with T-Mobile because I was misinformed by staff from this store. I’ve been trying to get help for a week but haven’t been able to get anywhere. Their customer service is good but I cannot deal with misinformation, it leads to wasting time. I asked questions and double checked but still got no where.< /Text>

I went from Sprint to T mobile ... I loved Sprint but hated the fact the with the I phone you can not be on a phone call and use your internet at the same time unless on WiFi ... it became very inconvenient.. although I loved the Sprint employees on Mitchelle rd in Ceres .....  So because you ARE able to use both features at the same time with T mobile is why I transferred... The T mobile store on Hatch rd in Modesto which is where I transferred over was great ... All employees very nice and Evelio the manager who helped me was great ... Thank you !!!!!< /review>

<review>Terrible customer service...I had to request to talk with manager 4 times. Until I asked for regional manager the manager came to assist me. I was only purchasing a new phone for an already established account and was told I needed to buy another sim. Sales clerk over charged me & said to cancel the transaction is would have to pay $50 restocking fee...neither of us had even opened the box up. After manager came out he fixed it with no apologies...just fixed the clerk mistake & didn't address me at all</review>< Pictures>

Love this Lamps Plus, everyone is super friendly and professional, and let me tell you, they have a LOT more than just lights and lamps and bulbs. All kind of great chairs, tables and knick knack paddy whack stuff. Check them out. Do it.</Review>

Lamps Plus in Oceanside is a great store and if Jennifer is available, please ask for her!<//text>< Pics>

<text>We have been so happy with Lamps Plus - Oceanside. Normally we are Costco-Home Depot-Lowes for lighting but... "eh". NOTHING special there.  We popped into Lamps Plus and there is soooo much to look at.  We thought it would be super $$$ and it's not. There is alot of variety in all price ranges. We got great service and attention from Gary. Highly recommend!  He has a good eye and helped us with design advice. He even printed out info on things we were just THINKING about... in case we wanted to order. Then when we did, it was so easy to do on the phone instead of coming back in.  Excellent, helpful sales person.  We are so pleased with our choices.<//text>< date>

As I walked in the 3 women sales associates quickly pegged me to be not the guy looking to remodel the lighting fixtures throughout the house.
They directed me to the guy in the back who handled the " specialty bulbs.
Glad they did. Sales Associate # 007( RIP Sean Connery)285 was the kinda guy that provides 110% service.
Knew his product. I'dbrought in the burnt out one. " That's a T-10; would you like frosted or clear?" " Let me show you the difference ". Screwed them both into empty sockets he had set up to give customers a real life comparison. That specialty bulb section was his domain. Courteous, prompt, and polite. They have a great employee in # 007285.
Unfortunately their Customer Service Satisfaction Survey sucks cuz I couldn't get it to open after 3 trys.
Glad this Google survey gave me a venue to express the good experience that I had there.
Btw,Trader Joe's ain't worth a 20 minute wait IMHO.
And I grew up in Pasadena going to the original one on Arroyo Seco Blvd back in the '70s< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Date>1605254792204< /Date><Resp>None</Resp>< user_name>

We received such amazing service here!

Christy was great in helping us find what we need. Pal made it easy to return what ended up not liking and getting something perfect for us. Alex too was nice and helped complete the transaction.

I recommend coming here for sure.<//review>

We went into our Oceanside store to see if we could find blades for a fan we bought about 12 years ago, not expecting to find any.  Christy Doeren  researched several areas and found them at the Chatsworth store.  Her willingness to go above and beyond was amazing.  Thank you for having an employee willing to do what she could for her customer.<//Review>

Expensive but good selection.  Can't buy online some of the bulbs for lamps they sell in the store.  Wasted a lot of time chatting with online assistant before driving to the store.  Courteous and knowledgable staff in the store.< /Review>

An online order that we received in January 2018 was kept in storage unopened until our new home was completed at the end of May. The end table was damaged and we were afraid that because it was past the 30 day return policy we were out of luck.  After speaking to the associate on the phone,  he said to bring the table in and they would be happy to replace it. They were WONDERFUL.</text>

The employees are too busy on the phone to help shoppers in the store, the manager is either never there or not available, they’re constantly changing prices on everything and their price match policy conveniently never applies to your purchase, they’re understaffed so even if you do get help the person helping is involved in 5 other things so you never get real help, and everyone there is obviously unhappy ! Total mess, feel sorry for anyone working there really.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Lamps Plus in Oceanside is my go to source for lighting for both my personal needs as well as for my business clients.  They have an incredible inventory of lighting products and if they do not have what you want they can get it for you.  I have had several lamps custom modified to suit the needs.  Every order is correct and delivery times have always been honored  The staff is helpful and pleasant however the real gem of the store is the owner, Pal.  What a genuinely nice guy.  He creates a welcoming presence and is extremely helpful, he goes above and beyond.  I highly recommend this store to everyone looking for any type of lighting!</review>

Completely understaffed.  The two people I saw were helping others while it was three deep at the unattended counter.  I looked around on my own and would have bought 3 post lamps I saw on their website but why wait. I found them on Amazon for the same price.
Just to support a brink and mortor store, I may still order from them if in stock but will not wait again for someone to man the counter.
Get your sh... together LP.< /Review>

<Text>The employee was racist as I tried to do my job. She pretended to be the manager but failed to realize that I know the mgr. She called the police on me and was shocked when I took the phone (unafraid) and explained everything to them including her impersonation of her boss. I said yes, I've worked this store when it was a different gas station last year and I know the manager. No we don't need you guys to come out. I'm going to call her boss. Thank you. She started crying and apologizing. Trying to give me free items. No thanks. Your free racism is enough to keep me full for a week.< /Text><time>1560900337241</time>< rating>

<review>AMAZING! A very steep trail I might add. We only did 3.5 miles, only half of the trail. The trail is very narrow and rocky. I highly recommend to wear good hiking shoes because it can be a bit slippery. The best part was the views of the mountains and how quiet and serene it looked. Definitely a place to burn off your calories. I would rate this trail as hard.</review>< Name>

Great hike! If you do the full loop you’ll get around 1400 ft elevation and 5 Miles. You could see some snow capped mountains at the top. Has a side that’s dirty and another that’s paved. Fun hike! Dog friendly.< /Text>

I had plan to go to the fall but the google maps took me here. Very nice view and moderate trail. Because i was looking for a way to go toward the fall I lost the miles that I hiked. There were limited parking spots between ten to 15 cars. It should be easy for kids older than 8 and intresting. If you continue walking on mine path you will go to the beautiful part with running water under the shade of trees.</text>

This was a pretty good workout we did the hike clockwise so the beginning was nice and shady and pretty straightforward into the canyon but coming back that trail up to the road is pretty steep and there were quite a few people for a Thursday but I recommend this hike especially after it rains< /Review>

Had a good time here with a good friend of mine, it's like free therapy when you arrive walking and listening to nature you become one. The people are real friendly when you pass them or see them they greet  I will definitely come back on my own to take more harder paths and a One on one with nature.</text>

Fantastic hike. Trail is in excellent condition. Bicyclists can be a problem in the afternoon. Trail was recently refurbished. Bike ruts are coming back quickly.<//text>

Great trail but be careful for mountain bikes coming down the hill FAST. While some of them have bells on their bikes (so you can hear them coming), many do NOT and aren't paying attention.<//Review>

I loveeee this trail and I'm always lucky enough to catch it right at sunset after a trek up echo mountain to Inspiration Point. Stunning views of the greater Los Angeles area to the ocean, and lush greenery that offers a bit of shade during the blazing days of SoCal summers.< /Text>

<Text>This is a secluded singletrack trail with switchbacks and rocky features. Rideable on my hardtail, but more appropriate for downhillers.

You can go up Sam Merrill to Echo Mountain, across Mt Lowe trail and down this trail if you are adventurous.< /Text><username>Brian Grimm<//username></record>

< review>
Absolutely horrible service, they were extremely rude to me and my wife as we don’t exactly fit in racially. We were waiting for 50 minutes for a chair to open up, even though we were next on the sign in sheet, they were letting customers who came after us in before us for the last 25 minutes we were there. The place is nice but I don’t recommend it unless your Asian or white.</review>

Bad service . I had to come back for fixing pedicure and the manager was so rude to me . She refused to give me plastic sandel after I finished . I asked her to buy it she said ok for 2 dollars and then she said I don't take card ! I had to Walk to my car without anything , and she was watching me and she didn't give me one !
They are just care about money . They talk in rude way. I used to go every 2 weeks and spend 100 dollars and give them good tip ! I referred my mom and sister and friends too .  Im not going to there salon any more ! At allllll .</text>

<Review>I had a great experience with Vanessa and will definitely come back to her. She was very thorough, gave a detailed manicure and was helpful in choosing the perfect gel color.
I’ve e been here plenty times, this business continues to provide exceptional service, clean, cautious and safe during this pandemic.</Review>< pics>

<text>It was my first time at this nail salon and was helped by Amy T. She was amazing! Probably one of the best experiences I've had at a nail salon because Amy made sure my cuticles and French Gel Manicure was absolutely perfect without me telling her. Chroma Nails Salon is a huge shop and it was so big, clean, and processional. They accept credit cards, but please make sure to bring cash for tips, as they won't let you add gratuity on cards.< /text>< pics>

They do such a great job and they're so sweet and really take the time to make sure they're doing a great job and that you really like what they're doing.

<review>Love this place! I have been going here since September 2019 and I have never once been disappointed! They are SO clean and friendly. With COVID, they have taking extra steps to ensure everyone’s safety. Once you walk in they ask you to sanitize your hands and take your temperature. Before you pick the color, they give disposable gloves. Every other station is operational with plastic guards between you and your nail tech, even at the pedi chairs.

If you’re looking for a new nail salon to go to, this is the place!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<review>I tried Chroma for the first time today, first thing is they are super clean (I'm a cosmetologist I'm pretty picky about cleanliness of a salon), secondly I didn't have an appointment and they fit me in no problem, and also Mimi did an excellent job on my nails. I like them pointy but not sharp and she did them perfectly and was also very nice to chat with. I'll definitely be back!<//review>< Pictures>

This place is open and spacious with lots of comfy massage chairs.  Its always busy on the weekends so I only go on weekdays and I make reservations.  Most of the nail technicians speaks English fairly well and very friendly.  Good service.<//review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I love Chroma Nails. There are so many people, so they can take you at any time.  They also serve alcohol (beer and wine) for an additional $3! I only get gel manicures done and I only get them done by Summer. She's so amazing! She's a perfectionist, so my nails always come out great. I go every two weeks because my nails grow so fast, but they have never chipped once. She's so talented. I just show her a picture and she  just whips up the design. She also makes great suggestions.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

I love Chroma and usually have a truely professional mani/pedi experience.
Make sure you clearly explain what it is you want or misunderstandings occur.
U'll be back and recommend them over any other nail place around. Its the little things like warm towel wipe downs, skilled hands and a nail tech who us efficient with out seeming rushed or distracted.< /review>

I have been coming here since they opened... and no other place compares.  I have been ruined because I don't want to go anywhere else.  The place is clean.  They don't reuse the tools,  the pedi massages are amazing.  I wish I could take a nap because it is so relaxing.. You will not be disappointed.</Review>

Loved my experience here. I'm visiting San Diego from Maryland, and it's very refreshing to come across such great service. The front desk was very friendly and my Tech Jody was amazing. I had a friend with me who had Lisa as his Tech and she was amazing too. What I enjoyed about these two young ladies the most was the conversations. Usually nail techs don't talk to you. They just do their jobs and keep it moving. But these two were very engaging. When I relocate to this area I'm definitely coming to Chroma every week!!! 🙂</text>

Absolutely amazing experience with Krystal. We shared funny banter, while she genuinely took the time to care for, and repair my nails. Did a phenomenal job, and I could not be happier! Did I forget to mention the cherry on the top was the oil rub down, hot cloth, and lotion massages - All make you feel like a queen 😍 thank you so much! Will be coming back

I shared my previous two month experience with her from a different salon, and you guys have them utterly beat!<//review>

This place is absolutely perfection! Spotlessly clean, an endless selection of colors and options, they serve you hot tea and or water and it's just such affordable luxury! They are all great, but Tina is amazing! She is an artist and a perfectionist, and my nails show it!< /text>

My daughter & son got me a gift certificate for my birthday and it was one of the worst experience in this fancy nail business they lied about the quoted prices for my services. I will NEVER and I promise NEVER EVER Patronize Chroma Nails go to LANDIS or Anywhere but there who cares if they serve alcoholic drinks & Champagne it's probably so you will be tipsy while they rip you/the Client off!!!</text>

Today I went to the lounge and the bald guy who checks you in for the service you gonna get was extremelyyyyyyyyyy rude, and disrespectful. I called made appointment for me and my sister when I got there he first refused having two appointments for both of us, then when I asked him if he could do the Acrliyc instead of gel he started going mad and saying you said gel and now you want acrylic blah blah.. this is not how a customer should be treated. He should’ve been more thankful for I was going to pay him more and I already had the appointment no matter for what. Anyway I do not recommend this spa at allllllllll. The service is bad and so the staff. He didn’t even care about the present customers sitting there, he still shouted and disrespected and asked my sister to leave aggressively and with no sorry nothing.<//text>

<review>You're paying for the amenities however the pedicure and manicure with gel on top I would give it a C+. They are pretty expensive for a gel manicure it's $45 in for a gel pedicure it's $50 so if you're looking for more amenities than you are accuracy and consistency this would not be the place to go.<//review><user_name>Heather Taylor<//user_name>< Pictures>

Although the owners are very nice, the food was not good with very poor taste. The sweet & sour shrimp was the worst. Best by far were the fortune cookies.</Review>

Very good service. Lady is very nice, like eating at home. Food is very good! I ordered sweet and sour chicken. Nothing fancy about it but the flavors were all there. I would definitely go back to try something else<//review>

Don't let the strip-mall setting deter you (note that, as pointed out by other reviewers, that the restaurant moved from San Marcos to their new Escondido location a few years ago) - the owner (Nancy) is very friendly, and highly attentive, and the food is delicious. Shrimp with lobster sauce and mu shu pork are especially delicious - along with a slate of classic offerings (e.g., spring rolls, sizzling rice soup, etc.). Great place for family celebrations!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80dbf36bcb39a861:0x7c55ff40197909b4</gmapID></record>

Have you ever wondered what it's like to be served dinner by the most friendly, cheerful, sweet, Asian grandma in the world? If so, eat here. The food is super tasty, the decor is straight out of 1992. You'll leave with a full tummy and a smile on ur face. I promise!<//Review>

<review>This is by far one of my favorite Chinese restaurants  .. actually they are one of my favorite restaurants all together.   This is not just because they offer a crazy jalepeno infused fried rice, it ties as well to the husband and wife that own/run this establishment being beautiful people.

I recommend this place for those looking to try a new place, looking for Chinese food,  and those looking to just enjoy a meal.  They are not a ritzy, dress up location, but they do deliver an upper shelf, welcoming environment, similar to a good friend inviting you to a meal at their home.

Enjoy.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>The Peking Duck was a work of art. Expertly prepared, moist and generous!! Probably the nicest people you'd ever run into who clearly love what they do, and it comes through in their food!! We picked up several dishes to go for my dad as a surprise, and they were putting the finishing touches on everything as we arrived so it was fresh and ready!! War Won Ton, Chung King Pork and the Peking Duck were standouts!!  If you want the duck, call ahead, it takes an hour to prepare. And ask for them to make you duck soup from the bones!! They made my fathers birthday one to remember and we will a) spread the word and b) be back!! Best Chinese food around here, without a doubt!

Thank You Star House!!! I'd give you 6 stars if I could!

P.S. if you haven't tried the food, set foot inside or even met the owners, don't leave a 1 star review because "no one aswered the phone"...no one cares about your opinion and you hurt the establishment.< /review>< Resp>

A top site for delicious chinese food. Excellent spot to spend time alone or talk business. I had a brother come into town and asked me to take him back here. Wish it was closer to my house, I would come every week.</Text>

I don't  know who is doing all the nice ratings but this the worst Chinese food experience I've had in all my 39 years on earth the chicken cantonese tastes like it was frozen food heated up with a splash of chinese seasoning never again no thank you...thier food deserve a half of star the old couple deserve 5 stars as far as how nice they were.</Text>

My girl and I always like the orange chicken with mixed veggies and rice.
I also tried the BBQ pork fried rice as a change up and it was really good.
The owners are brother and sister and provide great customer service for affordable prices.

Try them out next time you're in the area.< /Review>

<text>I tried the Peking Duck because of the review from Marc Pierucci and I was not disappointed! There is nothing better than Chinese prepared duck when done right, and this delightful couple did it to perfection. The funny thing is, I expected to get like a quarter duck, but when I got there the chef held up a whole duck for me to admire. I wish I were a better writer so I could accurately describe how golden brown and crispy it looked! So I got the whole duck, chopped up in to bite size pieces and three bowls of home made broth to come home with. I enjoyed everything at home with my family and it was simply amazing. By the way, my young girls love the dumplings! The owners are hard working and very nice. I think this is the best Chinese meal you'll find in Escondido.</text>< UserId.>

This was our first time eating here. We enjoyed everything, hot-n-sour soup, Mongolian chicken could have had more  heat for our taste but they did supply us with hot oil. The last dish we had was house special pan fried noodles. This restaurant unt has been in business since 1989 and it is family run. We will definetly return.<//Text>

< review>
My wife and I are originally from Chicago and out there Chinese food restaurants are a dime a dozen, I'm not particularly fond of Chinese / Asian food.. probably because I've never had any properly prepared, but this place is ridiculously great. we always order the five-star jalapeno rice and something else that's insanely delicious, (sesame chicken or chan pi beef) the food's not breaded to all hell nor is it covered in salt. You can tell that food was prepared carefully and with love. We have yet to try the peking duck but we're very much looking forward to it.< /review>

<review>It seems like I would never try the food of this restaurant. Today I went t pick up my grandmother from a old folks home she was placed. All I wanted to do was to take her to eat Chinese Food, her favorite. Heard of this restaurant so decided to drive there. When we arrived it was almost noon. Opening time is 11am. Doors where locked and we saw a half naked man and a dog running around inside the restaurant. Owner got there as we were leaving. She said she will open now and not to leave. We left cause we were not going to eat in a place we saw a dog running around. Who knows how really safe their food is. Very dissatisfied and disappointed. If business not open on hours of operations then that has to say something unprofessional about that business.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmap_id>

Did not like the food at all, ordered beef chop suey, it was in a clear chicken like sauce with absolutely no flavor. When I asked them why it wasn't in a beef flavor sauce he got mad and basically said he cooked it in chicken stock and added beef.
Wife ordered vegetables in a brown sauce, guess what the same thing a chicken based sauce with no flavor!

Stay away, any place is better than this joint.<//Review>

Nice service and vehicles, but sadly they are crazy faced Mask cult initiates who will screech at you for not wearing a mask even tho they have masks and massive Glass shields. Really sad these poor people are so misguided and misinformed ..<//Text>

The experience overall was good, however their roadside emergency takes a really long time to get a hold of costing me at least one day, if not two of my trip.< /review>

<review>Ok cars available good deals, good customer service but what I didn't like was the $500 deposit on rental car that I had reserved. $500 bucks because I use my debit card really. Instead of the $150 or $200 regular deposit. No cool Hertz.</review>< Pics>

<text>Hertz was way easier to work with than Enterprise, they also allowed me to go fill up the tank before charging me for coming in empty. Pretty cool, they also offer you to prepay the same rate of gas as where you picked up, and they'll give you a ride home when you drop off. 10/10 will drive with Hertz again.<//text>< pictures>

Worst Hertz in the country, by far. NO SHUTTLE from or to the airport and they will charge you an extra day if you have to return the vehicle on the weekend because they are not open Saturdays or Sunday to check in the vehicle. Even though the reservation is for a weekend return. Stupidest thing ever.<//Review>

I booked a car through Expedia with Hertz at the Eureka (CA) airport location for last Sunday, Aug 16. When I arrived at the airport, the Hertz location was closed. I was then informed that the location is closed every weekend. Because Uber and Lyft was not available in order to get me to my destination (Brookings, Oregon), I had to order a taxi. Although Hertz let me make a reservation for a car at a location that is not even open on Sundays, Hertz will not reimburse me for my taxi fare. Instead they are telling me to contact Expedia, and Expedia is telling me to contact Hertz. I am confused and simply shocked that Hertz would let me make a reservation for a car for a location that is not even open... and Hertz' failure to provide accurate information of location ended up leaving me stranded somewhere that I don't even know. I usually didn't have any problems with Hertz in the past and shocked that they would allow this practice.<//Text>

The Hertz corporation is a joke I rented from them 3 months ago and have been trying since then to get a refund I returned my vehicle 5 days early and never received the proper reimbursement. the employees in the store just give you that deer in the headlights look anytime you ask any serious questions and will tell you you have to call the headquarters. They will put you on hold for hours and will do everything they can to keep your money. Do yourself a favor and pay the extra money and go to Enterprise. Hertz charges less because there shady and will rip you off any chance they get.< /Text>

It would be nice if u could pay in advance. And i dont think they allow debit cards and if they do they do a credit check and u better not have anything negative or they wont rent to u. But they did have the best prices. So i used a charge card and went with them< /Review>

Never had a bad experience at this Hertz. Great service, really helpful, and will try to save you money when possible. Even as go above and beyond to make your experience with them as easy a possible. Highly recommended. I have been using  this company for over 6 years since enterprise across the street was a hassle and rude. Thank goodness that happened!< /Review>

< review>
I rented a car to go to Idaho with my husband and three kids.  Everything was fine until the way home.  We got a flat tire.  The onstar wouldn't work.  We walked and got barely enough service to call the roadside number and we couldn't get through to anyone.  I called the Eureka office, where I rented the car and they answered.  I told the lady my situation, flat tire, no service three kids in the car, the spare tire only had 7 pounds of pressure in it.  She told me I had to call the roadside number.  I explained all that to her also.  Her answer again was I had to call the road side number and there was nothing they could do for me.  So the husband and I decided to drive super slow until we could find somewhere.  We finally got to a gas station, bought a plug kit and fixed the tire (also putting the correct amount of air in the spare tire in case we got another flat).  When I returned the car I explained everything to them again.  The guy who helped me when I returned the car was amazing (Sedrick) but his supervisor or coworker, who ever she was, who was standing over his shoulder the whole time was rude.  After all of that, two days later, we realized that we left a prescription and my daughters retainer in the back passenger door.  I phoned the office, a woman answered, said she would look and call me back.  She never called me back.  So a few days later I called again, this time speaking to Jessica.  She called me back and said they never found anything, which is weird because I know for a fact, 100%, that we left it in that door. I think I will go with Enterprise from now on.</review>

I’d be ok with their high prices if their service was decent. They lie about the class of cars available (they make up their own definition of a midsize). They refuse to tell you availability of vehicles & have a VERY difficult time providing straightforward answers to basic questions if you call in. And it takes 45 min just to get signed in and drive off.< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I used Hertz the day before thanksgiving, and had a great experience. I reserved my car online and called beforehand, so there was no worry about a car not being available. I was lucky enough to be upgraded for free, and the car was clean and spacious. Overall the staff was helpful and friendly, but I think reserving your car both online and via phone is the way to go, to ensure everything goes smoothly the day of rental.<//Text>< Pictures>

I had to rent a car because the engine in my car went out while I was on vacation. I expected to have my car fixed in a week, and it took over two weeks. Every day I had to call Hertz and extend my car rental for another day. The staff was always very pleasant, helpful, and efficient!!! I greatly appreciated their wonderful service!<//review>

<Review>I rented a car in January to see my dad who was in the hospital, I picked my car up from the Airport in SL, the cost was double what i was told, so I went to 750 Main St. and talked to Barbara, she was great, helped me and brought down the charges as much as she could, so when I came back out for my dads funeral I called for her but she had moved to the Bountiful store, so I called there, she helped set everything up and gave me a great deal and she remembered me and gave me condolences for my loss.  Barbara is such an upbeat lady, who loves what she is doing and  wants to help get you the best deal and as someone who was going through to much to work out the details, Barbara Fwiantek was a blessing to me.</Review>< Resp>

<Review>We picked up our car at the Los Angeles Airport and drove up to Eureka. We spent the night in Eureka and when we woke up the 2019 GMC Acadia that we were given in LA was having a serious malfunction. When we started the vehicle all the lights on the dash come on and we had multiple error messages pop up on the screen stating "Occupant Restraint Error," "ABS Error" etc. and none of the signals, speedometer, fuel gauge or radio controls would work. We tried to call roadside assistance but was hung up on after explaining our problem to the representative on the phone. So, we checked on our phones and realized there was a Hertz rental location less than a mile away and we decided to drive over.
Upon arriving at the Hertz location in Eureka we felt relieved because there were multiple vehicles (Several Grand Caravans and a couple of Tahoes) on the lot so we figured they would be able to easily switch us into another vehicle. Boy where we wrong! After speaking with the young man at the counter he explained that he did not know what they were going to do because all the vehicles on the lot were reserved for pickups later that day but he thought they had a Chevy Equinox that we could take. After looking at the Equinox we determined that it was much too small for use considering we had 3 adults and a toddler in a chair seat along with all our luggage and also considering that we had reserved a Standard SUV Group L SFAR (Grand Cherokee or Similar) we felt this was a considerable downgrade. We were then told that they could have us ride over to the Eureka Airport location and if they had a vehicle more in the class that we needed. This seemed absurd so we asked if they could look and see what they had or even call over and check for us. We were then told that they had just had a plane land and was busy so they could not call over and ask for us. (Again, this was absolutely absurd and not our problem in the least). While we were still trying to figure it all out a GMC Terrain pulled into the lot to be returned. They ended up giving us the Terrain which we settled for because it was a little bigger than the Equinox. Nevertheless, we were still really cramped in the Terrain while previously we had plenty of room and was extremely satisfied with the Acadia that we originally had. We also were not offered a discounted rate because the vehicle we got stuck with would have actually been cheaper if we had rented that class.
Then to make matters much worse we were told that if they gas was below where it was when we picked it up that we would be charged $9.99 per gallon. I asked how we were supposed to know how much fuel was in the vehicle since the fuel gauge did not work and why they couldn’t wave that policy due to the circumstance and the agent just shrugged he did not know.
Why could they have not called the location at the airport for us? Why could they not have given us one of the vehicles on the lot that met our needs? Why couldn’t they have given us a car and gotten one from the airport or another nearby location for the pickup later in the day? We were already extremely inconvenienced by the situation and they were not trying to help us. We are repeat customers that had already paid for our rental and it actually seemed that they were trying to be as difficult as possible.
After this experience I think we are going to cancel our Gold Membership and start using Enterprise again because we did not have these kind of issues.<//Review>< Pics>

I'm a Hertz Gold Member and reserved my car online. When I went to pick it up, I was not given any explanation of charges, verbally or even a printed out receipt. I was unknowingly given a more expensive car than I had reserved, and charged $25 extra per day for it, again, not told to me when I picked up the car. When the car was returned, the guy at the desk, Jake, basically said there was nothing he could do about it, and to call Hertz if we wanted to. I called the Billing dept at Hertz and got yelled at by  the lady I spoke to, who told me to "take responsibility for this." I stayed courteous throughout the whole call because I really want to give her the benefit of the doubt that she's not a mean person; I really hope Hertz records their phone conversations. She then gave me the number for the Hertz location where I picked up the car and told me to talk to the manager, and when I called, it turns out that particular manager hasn't worked for Hertz for years. I had to call for three consecutive days, leaving a message & callback number every time (no one ever called me back), until a manager finally picked up the phone. The manager, Jessie, said she believed Jake when he said he gave me a verbal explanation of charges, even though she did confirm with him that I was never presented with a paper printout of the charges when I picked up the keys. She decided not to believe me, and I got the feeling that even if she did believe me, she wouldn't have done anything about it.< /text>

Regarding the airport location:
If I could rate this location less than 1 star, I would.  The guy that is always there, Carl, is a terrible representation of this company.  Not only does he have a bad disposition and look like a slob but he's rude to customers, spews incorrect information, and lacks in customer service skills.  His phone etiquette is terrible, he does the minimal work required by his position, and has told several people that  he's been with Hertz so long, they'll never get rid of him because he has 'pull'.  This is truly one employee who should be fired or seriously re-trained.  I will never, ever rent from this Hertz location again and I have passed along my negative experience to all my friends and co-workers.<//review>

<Review>We rent thru these guys a lot and they are always helpful. The only time we even had a problem was on one occasion they didn't have the vehicle size that we had reserved. But they we as accommodating as they could be and even offered to let us rent a larger car for the same price. We chose a smaller car, which worked out okay. And the even threw in free SiriusXM radio. Great place to rent from! Would definitely recommend.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>The staff were friendly enough, but incompetence didn't help. The higher end car I had reserved and paid for was not actually reserved. In its place, they offered me a "A" class car, basically the lowest cheapest one you can rent, with no refund for the much more expensive car I had rented. After a substantial amount of complaining and showing my reservation printout I was given an actual upgrade, that was known for mechanical issues and had been in and out of the shop.
Settling for the higher end car, we did the walk around and I had to point out that every panel had scratches, dents, nicks, and a broken bumper.
Good enough....got inside and smelled like it had been used by a bunch of potheads as their personal hot box. The armrests, cup holders, steering wheel, dash, all the buttons and knobs were covered in a thick layer of grime. for a car with 8k miles, this seemed a bit much. I cleaned it myself once I got home before driving any distance.
Never again.< /review>< userid>

She called me at the time I was supposed to be picked up & said she was just leaving & asked how to get to my house.

I was told that someone would be here between 9-12 today. I got a call around 9:30 from the repairman saying he was 20 min out. He showed up and diagnosed the issue quickly. He had it repaired and everything cleaned up within 1.5 hours and for the least expensive price that I've ever had in any garage door repair. I could not be happier with the service, price and professionalism. I will definitely use this company again and recommend them to everyone in the area.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Text>Our Garage door  was weighty, and the opener was no longer working.
Tom came out to check the system.
He explained everything that went wrong but never tried to pressure us.
It was apparent, though, the whole system needed replacing.
Considering his help, we requested him as our installer.
What a great and careful job he did for us.
The new door and the opener are working great.<//Text>< pics>

today we tried to close our door and it just fell off track.
AER  was here in about an hour.
They immediately got to work after explaining to me why and how this happened.
Tom fixed my door, even lubricated it and changed a few of the little rollers on the tracks.
Perfect like new! they didn't try to sell me extra stuff , check my motor for free and said my liftmaster was great and no need to replace now

<Text>This guys are lifesavers !!
I back in to my friends garage door and knockout the door from the rails.
I search for garage door company in canyon country and called two different companies who can come asap.
The first company told me there is no way to fix it and that I have to replace my door .
Tom with AER did it right he was working on the door around three hours but got it to work even better then before according to my friends and saved me a lot of money and headaches.

A great place to visit if you like MTG or want to start. The place is very welcoming for all levels and helpful for those looking to start. Great collection of singles and they have all the new editions and lots of old and foreign pack as well. Plus I found out they play magic almost everyday.</Text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>Crazy Fred is the actual guy you will see when you come to this store. He is a very interesting person and he obviously tries to create a safe family environment. I would feel comfortable letting my kids (aged 9-10 & up) come in here by themselves while I run errands in the area. He's outgoing and honest - for him it's about the art and commerce and culture more than either making money or preserving precious paper. People play games here. Food and drink are allowed (use common sense when around paper and cardboard). If you are into comics and you don't already know Fred, you can get to know him in about 5 minutes - and I suggest you do.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUkGEm1c3zPPSjKwvQOaWZqRWhLtQ5rSMbpLzb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<review>What a fun place. Great service. An awesome selection of MTG cards, dice, sleeves. D&D library. They have tables set up to play. They have a large selection of MTG decks you can borrow to play in store.

There is a drink refrigerator. Comic books and some of the lastest board games to purchase.

The owner and employees are very friendly and knowledgeable.

If I lived closer I would love to hang out here.</review>< pics>

First time visit. Amazing experience. Owner was AMAZINGLY helpful. We went in for some sleeves and found a new set of cards and sleeves he suggested. He was extremely welcoming, very energetic,  and he even gave us beginners set of magic to see if we like it. Will definitely be back just because of this experience.  Thank you!!!</Text>

I tried to support this local comic book store by buying a popular graphic novel from them instead of ordering it online. I looked at their shelves to find it but there was an empty spot where it probably used to be. I asked the guy running the store if I could special order it, and he took my name and phone number and told me he would call me when it came back in stock. I never heard back from them after several months went by. I just went in to look again and the graphic novel I wanted was sitting on the shelf. Sorry, I bought it online already.</Text>

<Time>1498975423674< /Time><Rating>4< /Rating><text>This place was great, lots of rare and unique products, helpful friendly staff, small store but clean, this is probably the smallest store it sent into during my time in San Diego, however what it lacks there it makes up in its character.  I docked a point off because the stores event organization is nonexistent.  Events are demand based rather than regularly scheduled.  If you're looking for high tier competition or regularly firing events with lots of people this is probably not the store. That said, they offer a good military discount and have good prices.</text><user_id>111176898207208967250</user_id>< gmapID>

I have never reviewed anything online before and never intended too but for this I will make an exception. Fred's is thee most exceptional magic store I have ever been too, I adore the place, aside from the colossal amount of cards to choose from at some seriously nice prices, the banter is absolutely fantastic. Everybody, including the customers, are so nice and helpful and you can tell that they all genuinely enjoy being there and Fred himself is a blast, immensely funny bloke. If I had the money I would move from Ireland to be near that wonderful store. That's how great Fred's is.
Do yourself a favor and get over there.< /Review>

Decent prices and nice selection of recent comics and MTG singles and retail products. Also good place for DnD or just picking up a game of Magic. Will have to spend some money if you spend a lot of time here which you will want to do. Fred is a masterclass in nerdiness and customer service. Highly recommended.</Review>

One of the Cleanest card card shops around, customer service is always above and beyond the the door you walk thru to get your cards and comics as well as accessories. Fred, the owner is a kind hearted person as well treats everyone with respect and does what he can to help you get the items your looking for even sometimes recommends other places to find a card or two if he is out. For that I give him a 5 star rating. Biggest selection of magic cards I have seen.<//review>

The owner is absolutely amazing even if he is completely swamped  he'll somehow find a way to help you. He will unselfishly offered his time to sit with you and help you with your cards. I cannot express how amazing this place is.  Fred is embodiment of what everybody in the customer service industry should strive to.</text>

Premium items at decent prices, but the biggest and most important reason to shop here is because of the owner,  Fred,  i have never met a shop owner so vested in his clientele.  Very attentive to your needs and welcoming, also provides a warm positive atmosphere for anyone looking to cone in and play games,  whether it be d&d, magic,  yugioh, board games table games card games etc.<//Review>

While visiting San Diego, Crazy Fred's bent over backwards to help me and my family play during the pre-release for Magic the Gathering.  The store is organized and very well stocked: a dream for Magic players.  I can't recommend this place enough!  Friendly and professional!  If I lived in San Diego I would go here for FNM and all other Magic events.  Just a great store!<//review>

<text>I used to come to this place once or twice a month to browse and buy singles and do pick up EDH games.  The first few times I went Fred was very polite and helpful.  However, after several visits it became apparent that his customer service and organization skills are pretty much nonexistent.

Fred randomly strikes up conversations with others and gets sidetracked in the middle of transactions.  He also doesn't seem to have a good knowledge of his current inventory. When I have come in asking for specific EDH singles he responds to my inquires with "I don't know look in the case".  I feel like his part time employees have a better understanding of the current inventory and pricing on any given day.  Meanwhile Fred holds court at the register and seems to grow impatient with basic questions and off the cuff price quotes.

Tonight, after being barked at when I inquired about some fetch land prices,  I decided I was done doing business at this place.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I came to California to visit my grandma and i wanted a place to play. I found his shop and have never had a dull or bad moment. Hes a great guy wonderfull with kids and chill with everybody. In reference to this rent thing, i have seen the sign but ive never been charged and neither has anybody who has been there. and i have spent over four hours in his shop and never had a problem. its a great store and i will be going back many times. I even bought a shirt.<//Review>

<text>My son is 11 years old and had only been playing Magic for 3 month when he was at Crazy Fred's playing and buying by without me there when he got a rare unplayed foil Jace, the Mind Sculptor card. He had no idea how rare this card was or how much it was worth. Fred bought it off him for only $60 without telling him anything about the card and never told me that the exchange took place. He talks so much about how he looks out for the kids in his store then he took advantage of my 11 year old that way. If he was really looking out for the kids then he would not have bought the card but told my son how rare it was and to hold on to it and not let it go. He is only looking out for himself and making money. We have since switched to Game Empire where there is no "rent" fee and the people are very helpful.< /text>< pics>

a amazing store for everyone, it may not be for people without a sense of humor, but if you are ok with getting stomped and stomping others at cards and in games. to the people that are complaining, please reconsider because fred's is the place for play card games and read comics.</Review>

< Review>
Was in the area so I figured I would pick up a few of the new commander box sets.  Fred was charging between $49.99-$59.99 for each one.  MSRP is only $30.  Way to price gouge.  Promptly left and headed over to Villainous Lair Gaming.  They had all in stock and were charging MSRP.

Besides that, Fred is annoying.  His whole better than you opinion he seems to have of himself gets old quick.  He also has lame (he seems to just make things up) rules for tournaments.  Any seriously player should avoid this place.

I would recommend Villainous Lair gaming or GameZone if you're looking for a place to play.< /Review>

I wemt to freds because my girl friend told me about the place and that her ex used to go there. So i stoped by to pick up some zendikar boosters and to cjeck out the place. Fred at first was super polite but soon after questioning is prices wich are marked up atleast 200% he became a little short with his answers. He has a im better than u attitude.
But worst of all was his manerism tawords my girlfriend. Vey creepy and i would not recomend fred. Like one review said if i had to only play at freds or quit magic id quit magic!</review>

<Review>You setup appointment online. They then text you later that that appt time is not available. I setup appt online,  took day off for simple oil change, then received text that time slot was not available for at least another week. I contacted shop and was told that a confirmation email was needed to reserve time slot. My question is, "why even bother booking online if the time slots are never available" Poor, poor, processes...lost a customer as I found another shop !< /Review>< Pics>

As usual, they did a fine job. I have a variety of old & unusual cars and they have always been able to take care of me.  When one of my cars doesn't pass the smog test, they provide good advise so that I can get make the corrections needed to be able to pass the test when I return.  Sam is especially helpful and knowledgeable.<//text>

Had my car smog here after I found a coupon online for $34.99. No appointment required. Only two cars were ahead of me and it literally took an hour. So if you're not in a rush it's a good service. The front office is clean and the lounge is convenient. Mask is required and sanitizer available. Pam at the front desk was nice. Also they do provide other services like oil changes. Overall good service.< /review>

Their quick but efficient work on my car was refreshing, and they went above and beyond with amazing customer service! Knowing that I was driving my car cross country, they could’ve very well racked up charges on what needed work on my car, but they were honest and trustworthy about everything! They even offered to top off my oil and fluids right before I take off for my trip. I am confident my journey will be smooth because of their thorough work and detail.

My smog was quick and the staff was really friendly and helpful. I had an emissions recall on my car, something I've never actually experienced before, and they walked me through the process on what needed to be done. I went on a Saturday and probably waited about 15 minutes for my car to go in. There were about 3 people ahead of me. Once the car was taken in to be smogged, it took about 15 minutes more after that before I was out of there. I sat outside, with the whole social distancing thing, and there was plenty of outdoor seating!

I love a quick and productive trip to the auto shop, especially when I get great deals from Groupon and great service! I will definitely be back here in the future!<//Review>

<Review>Go see SAM!!!!! This is the best place in town hands down. I had an issue failing smog and had visited multiple mechanics with no luck and nothing affordable. My visit to Valencia Auto Performance and Simply Smog was the last place I ever needed to visit.

Sam kept my costs low and he didn't give up until I passed smog. He kept me informed the whole way about what was going on. At no time did I feel like Sam was trying to add things on to bleed my finances. He made me feel like getting my car on the road in a safe legal condition was the number one priority.

Valencia Auto Performance and Simply Smog also provided full accommodations that included shuttle service to and from so I didn't have to miss work while they were diagnosing my cars issues. The times I had to wait on site flew by in their clean and spacious waiting room with top notch bathrooms a few steps away. Everyone from the owners to reception were kind, helpful, and knowledgeable.

All the issues you are worried about when looking for a mechanic shop (bad work, marked up pricing, lying, etc.) is not a concern at Valencia Auto Performance and Simply Smog. I promise you, this will be where your search ends for good honest car repair.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Still open during COVID19 outbreak.  I went in for a smog check. They limit the number of people in the office, and keep everything sanitized. I love this place. They accurately estimated the time, and everyone is helpful and pleasant.  Highly recommend taking your car here.</Text>

At first I was put off by the hourly rate of their technicians but discovered it was worth every penny.  My heater went out perplexingly and it was discovered that mice got in my car and ate the wiring while in the nest they built.  These dedicated professionals took the hard road and cleared the nest and "hand soldered" the connections back rather than just charge for a standard cable assembly to quickly connect.  The cable itself would have cost a fortune compared to the soldering job they did.  They were capable, fast and accommodating to my budget concerns.  For heavens sake!  The owner of the operation himself drove me home while they worked.  I whole heartedly reccommend this most excellent shop.

<Review>Oil change went fast. You guys did recommend a new filter for my Accord which I did myself. When I went to unscrew the 4 bolts two of them were broken off. I can’t really blame you guys but if you did check to see that a new air filter was required it seems your technician could have broken them off. No big deal.  It would just be nice to be informed that the bolts were broken if that was the case< /Review>< pics>

They were able to fit me in without an appointment for front and back brake pad replacements. Everyone was very nice and pleasant. Excellent waiting room that was very comfortable. I spent a few hours just reading my books and hanging around without feeling cramped or uncomfortable. Site was very clean. I would highly recommend this business and will return for doing more business.< /review>

There simply are not enough adjectives in the English language to properly describe the professionalism and efficiency of Valencia Auto Performance. This business and their employees continue to amaze me everytime I go in for service. I was there two days ago for a smog check. Immediate warm greeting upon entering the office. Fast, friendly and maximum productivity displayed by all staff. I was in and out in 20 minutes. And of course they have adapted to our current situation by implementing a thorough and meticulous sanitizing and disinfecting  ritual on every car upon service completion. Emphatically an enjoyable and astonishing experience. Many thanks to everyone at VAP.< /review>

< Review>
Went here for the first, and more than likely last, time to get a smog check on my GMC HD truck. I asked the older lady behind the counter, who I should mention was also rude, if she would accept one of their coupons that I found online for a $34.95 special on a smog check. She said she would. She then goes on to charge me almost $65 for the smog check. I again advised her that I had a coupon for a special they had online, which I presented prior to any work being done. She said that that price was with the coupon. She then stated that their was an extra fee for a heavy duty vehicle, which I have never heard of. When I asked if this was something new, she kind of rudely answered that it was not and that it was something that has been being charged for the last 15 years. I personally have never heard of this and had never been told by any smog check center of this charge. After I left I went ahead and called other smog check centers just to price the work and they were charging about $55-$60 for the same work, and when asked about the extra heavy duty vehicle fee, they said their was no charge for that. The only extra fees would be if the vehicle was older than 2000, which it is not.
I guess they had to make up some kind of charge to get their discounted money back. I think I would have had less of an issue paying the regular fee as long as lady didn’t charge me some fee for something that nobody else charges.< /Review>

<Response>{'time': 1591107520956, 'text': 'Dear Fernando: Very sorry you were not happy with your visit to our shop. We, along with many other shops, have always charged more for heavy duty vehicles because they are just harder to move around and to test. They end up taking a lot more time. The regular price for a "standard size passenger vehicle" is $44.95 ($34.95 for the test, $8.25 for the CA certificate & $1.75 for the electronic transfer fee) out the door, and we need to get $20.00 more on over size vehicles to make a small profit. This is spelled out on all our offers and on our Repair Order, which you signed, and is less than a lot of the smog test shops in the SCV. Sincerely, Mike Cavanah (owner)'}< /Response></record>

If you want a decent price for a smog test and good service, this is NOT the place to go. For starters, I had purchased a Groupon for $35 for a smog test, which I found out was ultimately WORTHLESS, because they advertise $34.95 as the price on their website. Nevertheless, I already bought the Groupon, so I called on a Saturday (about 2 hours before they closed) to see if they could smog test my '97 Toyota. I was told they wouldn't have time because it's a '97 & I would have to come in during the week because the test takes at least 45 minutes & they had other vehicles that day. Although I've never had the test take that long, I understood they were busy and said I would bring it in during the week. However, when I called during the week, I was told the latest I could come was 30 minutes before close, as opposed to the 2 hours I called in advance over the weekend. I arrived at about 2:15 pm (well before close) expecting a wait. There were no other vehicles in line, yet my car sat for at least 30 mins before even being moved into the shop for the test (mind you they advertise a "quick" smog). When I spoke with the cashier about the Groupon, I was told that because my car is a '97 I would have to pay $20 extra, which I have never heard of before, in addition to the $10 CA certificate fee, bringing the total to $65 just for a smog test. When I told the cashier that I have never paid that much just for a smog test in 13 years of owning the same vehicle, she told me I "could go somewhere else" and attempted to push the Groupon back at me on the counter. Clearly, I had already paid for the Groupon, so I was stuck. Over an hour later, which again was longer than usual, the test was done. Plain and simple, I will NOT go back & I DO NOT/WILL NOT recommend this shop. Waste of time AND money.<//Text>

< Review>
I am so happy with my experience at VAP! Sam told me the truth about my son’s car and it cost me nothing. He also advised me about maintenance that was due. I had the work done and the car ran great! Two days later when my check engine light went on Sam took the car in without an appointment and he got me a rental so that i could go to work. The problem was a faulty part from the original job and he replaced the part and didn’t charge me anything for any of the labor. The car runs smoothly now. Sam kept me informed throughout the day re the progress of the car and was very sensitive to my work situation.
I am so grateful for everyone’s kindness!! The girls that work the front desk are very sweet and Mike gave me a great pen!
I wish I could do more than write a positive review, but these are great people running an awesome shop! Thank you  so much!!!!</Review>

My service technician Sam Farah was amazing!!!  He went over and beyond the call of duty even spending extra time after hours to make sure that my service was completed so then I could pick up my car on time. I would really appreciate the attention  and detail he put into explaining everything to me and  providing excellent service in resolving the problem  with my car.  The entire staff communicated with me very well as well.</review>

Called ahead. Set up a convenient time when not to busy. My Silverado was taken right in and smog check performed. Renewed my DMV regs. next day. Only took around 15 minutes. Top notch waiting area, very friendly and courteous. Price is fair. Likely will always use Valencia Auto for this service for both our vehicles.<//review>

< review>
My car broke-down, I had the vehicle towed them, and they found that my fuel pump went out.  They replaced the pump, I was fine for about a month or so, then the vehicle broke-down again.  I took it back and they found that the replaced fuel pump was defective and had to be replaced.  They replaced the fuel pump with a new one at no charge (warranty), and the vehicle seems to be running fine again.  I was a little disappointed that I had second breakdown due to the faulty pump, but this was not their fault.  I was also a little disappointed that the dealership did not have another fuel pump in stock and I had to wait another day to get my car back... again, not really Valencia Auto Performance's fault and they setup a rental car for the extra day at no charge.< /review>

A great experience and it was rather quick to boot. The ladies up front were helpful and courteous. Waiting in the waiting room that was very comfortable and my only complaint, there was no beer in the waiting room. It was that comfortable. Thanks Simply Smog for a job well done. See ya in 2 years. Oh thank you for reminding me I have recalls due my Ram diesel.< /Text>

< Review>
My BMW got referred to CA BAR, and the manager was very rude in explaining what this means and what to do. As you said, this is not something you see everyday and new to us as well. Taking 2 min to explain what it means goes a long way. Thanks to Google I know what to do now.< /Review>

<text>Happy with actual service and speed of service.  Some confusion with how to complete the Groupon I was using. Also, Groupon advertised a $68 value when purchasing the deal.  This makes sense when adding the certification to the cost of the service without any coupons, however I still had to pay the certification fees of $10 on top of the Groupon value, so I am unclear on how the value was $68.< /text><Name>Edward Haller<//Name><Rating>4<//Rating>< gmapID>

I went to Valencia Auto Performance to get a smog check done on my car. They were quick and efficient. The front office person working there was very friendly and professional. They had a deal on groupon, so they are willing to do business via that venue as well. If you need a smog, go check them out.</text>

<text>I highly recommend this place for quick and professional service. I came here for a smog check, it was recently priced, the service was fast and I was out the door in no time. They have a nice clean lounge with coffee and water. They also have shuttle service and loner cars! Can’t beat it!< /text>< Pics>

I had great experience and great time with this store. They are very nice and very professional.  The staff are amazing, especially front desk lady Suzanne who welcomes you with smile and makes your visit a such a good and comfortable experience.
I went there couple times ( also today) for my both Lexus smog check and anytime I go there I feel like I'm walking in my house .
You guys are amazing and you should be so proud of your store and staff and the services.
You are my number one ☝️so far .
Thanks for an outstanding service and staff. By the way I love your waiting area. I can stay there all day ....Lol.   Edmond Vartanian</Text>

I recommend Simply Smog Valencia Auto Performance  to anyone who needs automotive service.  I have been coming here for about 8 years now.  They are fair, fast, and always friendly, which are a rarity these days.  Sam Farah, in particular, is a great asset to this business.   Keep up the good work!!< /Review>

<Response>None</Response><Text>I have been coming here with my old trusted 95 Ford Explorer for over 10 years.  With their amazing service and help, the truck just finally was sent to the junkyard due to the transmission failing for the second time with over 320K miles on it!  Woohoo!  Without Sam and Mike, that vehicle would have been gone long ago.

Sam Farah is the guy I like to work on my cars.  He always goes above and beyond in helping me out to save whatever I can.  After the truck was disposed of, I brought over the used car I was looking to purchase.  Sam stopped what he was doing, checked it out for me even lifting it up and letting me know of a couple of issues beginning to wear, and even took it for a test drive!  With his information, I was able to get a little bit of a discount on the car.

Mike is always helpful in any way he can and really all the employees here make me feel welcome and care about what is happening with my cars.
Great place to go for friendly neighborhood service!!</Text>< GmapID>

Perfect place! Friendly staff, and was able to get my smog done in no time. The lounge was comfortable and AC was perfect. What a place to be and know that your car is being taken care of.

Thank you!< /review>

<Review>I have a hard time believing any "they ripped me off" reviews because Valencia Auto Performance has been exceedingly honest with me for all the years we've taken our cars there to be serviced. Sam, Jeremy and Mike have always been totally upfront with what repairs were needed, versus what "could wait." I always come away from there knowing my car is in great shape, safe to drive, and that I've been treated fairly and with respect. Great business, great customer service... we'll be customers for as long as we live in Santa Clarita!</Review></record></dataset><record>

Simply Smog Valencia Auto Performance made my experience great during my visit. I went in to get my Smog checked. Took 30 minutes from check in to payment. The staff was very friendly and professional. They have a waiting room where you can sit, use WiFi, and watch tv while you wait. Reasonably priced and they had an online coupon when I went. So that was awesome. Will go back there when needed.</Text>

My go to smog place. They have great prices, and very easily accessible. They are very friendly and you never have to wait very long. They have a great waiting room with comfortable couches and refreshments like coffee and soda.

I recommend Simply Smog to all my friends and family!</text>

<Text>This is the third time that I have been to this shop but the first time at their new location.  When I unknowingly took my car in a little after closing, they accepted the job even though it would keep them working longer.  They also occasionally offer specials for repeat customers.  They have consistently been professional and prompt in working on my car and have earned another repeat from me.</Text>< pictures>

Simply smog is my number one place for service.

Their customer service is outstanding . They don't just treat you like you're some number. They genuinely care. I also enjoy their waiting room. Nothing is worse then waiting in a stale waiting room and Simply Smogs is far from that.

I will always come to Simply Smog as long as they exist. Thank you guys for providing outstanding service to your customers.< /review>

I wish I found them sooner. This is the type of mom and pop shop you want to support. They are friendly and attentive, and know how to fix your car. They shoot straight with you and don't scalp you on pricing. My repair quoted by the local Toyota dealership was $3500, they did it for $900, with a better warranty and handed me a rental car for 3 days, without me even asking.< /review>

Clean, accessible facility, professional staff, complimentary beverages (not just coffee) and a nicely appointed waiting area.

All this and I was in and out in less than 20 minutes in a busy facility (smog test) in Jan 2014.

Impressive!

I've subsequently had additional work performed on another vehicle and made Valencia Auto Performance my mechanic of choice in Santa Clarita.<//review>

The only glitch was that before going there I called to see how much their best price would be because my son has a 93 and I told them the year and make and I was quoted  64.95 . When we got there she looked at a chart and said it would be 74.95 . After missing the entry gate and having to go around the block we didn't want to go somewhere else but they need to give the right quotes and I feel like we should have  gotten the deal  that was quoted because it was her mistake not ours . Outside of that it was fine . One other small thing ; they had a TV in the waiting room but it didin't work.< /review>

<Review>These guys are outstanding in every way.  The waiting room is comfortable, with free beverages, lots of plush seating and a large selection of new magazines.  They are efficient in getting the work done so the waiting time is minimal and they know what they are doing as well as being interested in keeping their customers happy.  Just a great experience.< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
Simply put, they tried to rip me off. They said something about my broken AC coolant line affecting my ability to pass the inspection and some other things that had nothing to do with the smog test. Turns out as soon as I replaced the catalytic converter I passed with flying colors. Ultimately I got a good deal, and I'm glad for that. However, I will not be returning here as this dishonesty (it isn't a simple mistake that a mechanic makes) is enough to make this business questionable in my book.< /Review>

<review>I'm going to make this short and simple. I had them take a look at my truck in regards to the steering gearbox. Not only did it take them four days to it. But the return lines were loose and was leaking Power steering fluid. I felt that I was way over charged and will not be going back.<//review><Response>None</Response>< rating>

<text>I went in at noon for a smog check and oil change. As other reviewers have said, they were very professional and courteous. They told me it would be about 45 minutes, and they were right on.  The mechanic mentioned that my serpentine belt was really worn and that the upper radiator hose was leaking, and took me to the car and showed me what he was talking about.  He gave me an estimate, and I agreed to have the work done. He said it would be done by 3:00pm.  I came back, and the work was done for the agreed-to price, and the car had been washed and vacuumed!! Excellent service all around.  He also let me know that my front brake pads only had about 15% left on them and suggested that the next oil change I have them looked at. What an excellent experience!</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>After a certain employee was replaced, we have never had such wonderful service from anywhere else!  They are very fair and take excellent care of your car.  Never tells us false repairs need to be made and no overcharging.  They take care of all 3 of our cars.</Review><user_id>103858477779124841052<//user_id><Gmap_id>0x80c28712c32f5f63:0x6b0059f828dfabcf< /Gmap_id>< date>

Needed a smog, got a coupon for Simply Smog which was 15.00 less than any other auto shop, thought why not. The shop is at an easy location. Mike helped me get my car set up for a smog and I waited in the clean and comfortable waiting room. Took about 20 minutes,Done. I will go to simply smog for all my auto needs.<//review>

<Review>Nice shop with good service with free wifi, and soda. Bring a coupon and price is pretty good until I found Smog Pros right around the corner is $10 cheaper without coupon. Oh well. Nice clean shop was done in 10 minutes.Recommended.< /Review>< Response>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>If you want a honest repair shop, well Simply Smog Valencia Auto Performance is it! Not only do they do Somg test for less money then most. But they also do repairs on all makes and models. My Mercedes didn't pass smog this year, and they quickly found the problem with bad sensors. They made the repairs and I passed. Sam the repair tech. Is very knowledgeable on MBZ and BMW and I'm sure more. I have been to other shops who charge much more and try and sell you un-needed repairs. Not here! This is my go to repair shop from now on. I have been coming here for years for smog checks. Do yourself a favor and go here. No matter what you drive. They are very friendly and explain everything to you. And the owner Mike over sees all the repairs to make sure that they are done correctly! Thanks again Mike for running a honest repair shop!< /Text>< pictures>

These people dont know what they are doing. Went to get my car smog checked and was told it failed due to it missing 2 catalytic converters, i was doubtful about it so i went to get a second opinion with a REAL mechanic. He inspected my car and told me that there was nothing missing. He then recomended i go to a smog check shop/muffler shop in soledad and both shops said nothing was missing! This was nearly a $600 repair and all because this place doesnt know what they are doing. Save your time and money, go to any other shop. I can only assume they failed my car in order for them to do the repair. I wouldnt even recomend this place to someone i didnt like.< /Text>

We started by doing our smog certificates here, but when our regular mechanic wasn't available, we tried them for other work and were very pleased. They do not push unnecessary work and are highly professional.</Review>

Simply Smog used to be a good place to get a smog before they moved.  Ripped me off and owner made excuses that his wife who was behind the counter was just having a bad day.  They were rude and just wanted to get money from me even though they knew my car wouldn't pass smog.  Promised to help with trouble codes then said they had no idea what the codes meant, told me to Google them.   Avoid this business, take your car to a professional shop.</text>

I went in for a Smog Test and discovered an oasis of calm and service. The waiting lounge is very nice, better than an airport. there is free wi-fi and TV. And the coffee is free too. I was totally impressed. Simply Smog also has special offers for oil changes and other car related stuff which actually look like you'd want to use them. Great place!</review>

I took my truck in to get smogged. Their place is very clean, like they take pride in the facility. Their waiting roof is nice and they have wifi. They also will rent you a car for a day, if they do a major repair on your vehicle. The prices are very fair and the environment is good.< /Review>

Friendly service.  Even when they were completely swamped with customers, they still took the time to check in with everyone to give them an update on their service.  I would for sure go here again.</Text>

Everyone who works at Simply Smog from the mechanics to the managers to the office staff is incredibly nice, helpful, and professional.  After getting fed up with the slip-shod work and overpriced rates at the Volkswagen dealership, I brought my Touareg to Simply Smog.  Not only did they do the maintenance properly, they did it for half of what the dealership charges.  I will gladly take my car here for any and all service needs in the future.< /text>

I take both my car and truck here for everything, smog, oil changes and major repairs. My Accord was leaking oil from multiple locations and the dealer misdiagnosed the problem. John explained what was actually going on, showing me every spot it was leaking and why.  Tt's been running great ever since he did the correct work for a lot less than the dealer was going to charge me.   Thanks you guys for always getting it right! Carisa Marion< /review>

We've been to Simply Smog a couple of times since moving to CA, and both times I felt as though my vehicle was honestly diagnosed, I was fairly charged for services, and that the outcome was outstanding. The staff is friendly, and their professionalism is high.</Text>

<text>I called simply smog to get a quote for a radiator flush and was told 125$ to hook it up to a machine for their (bg cooling system service) which states a powerflush to clean the system. Upon arrival I was told it was 130$ and while watching them they never hooked up any machine, it was drained and filled...no machine or powerflush. When I questioned them about it they said they did hook the machine up to flush it. I stated I  watched the whole process from draining to filling to the test drive and no machine was ever used. They then proceed with excuses about why it wasn't hooked up to be (bg flushed) and Sam (with a condescending attitude) shows me an empty bottle of (bg solution) that was used to top off the radiator and states that's all the 130$(bg cooling service) is...a drain and fill not hooked up to a machine to powerflush it even though that's exactly what their display indicates...I paid the 130$ and left...highly doubt I'll be a returning any services again.
