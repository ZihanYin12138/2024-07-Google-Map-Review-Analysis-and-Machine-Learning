I had the pleasure to meet with the owner Jose, as he was recommended to me by my niece. Customer service was excellent and product was clean! both are very important to me as I have a toddler (what parent does not want super clean jumper). My past experienced with other companies consist of funky smell, mold, mystery sticky gunk in the jumpers with customer service that was dry and cold. I ended up renting from those companies because that was all that was available, in hopes they would deliver what I was looking for. Never happened, until I rented from EE!!  I 150% recommend Exclusive Events. They have quick response time (I'm a last minute planner/ shopper), Clean product, perfect pricing and outstanding customer service (They were very sweet with my son's excitement  upon delivery of the jumper and on the phone) and on time delivery and pick up! I definitely will be renting from them moving forward. Thank you again for your amazing work and work ethic. I am One happy momma!< /text>

Jose, the owner was was really easy going, polite, reliable and always had a smile. It made me feel good to do business with them. They rent supper cool bounce houses, water slides, photo booths and more. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a good party rental company in the Riverside area.< /Text>< user>

<text>Planned my daughters party last minute and ended up renting a jumper here. Best service I've had. Delivered it the night before the party and made sure we were happy with were it was placed. The jumper seemed bigger than most. The kids all had a blast in it. The one we got even had lights inside! So cool. Pick up was even easier than drop off. Will def be using this service again<//text></record>

<text>Would definitely recommend Exclusive Events and Party Rentals for all your party needs! Hosted a work event and we rented a jumper for all the kids. Jose delivered and did not disappoint!

Their service was nothing short of efficient and as promised. They dropped off all the supplies the day they had promised, no matter how late they had to stay to set everything up. They really took the time to make sure everything was secured and up to par with the vision we had for the party. From the setup, to the supplies themselves, they are as professional as I have seen. Very friendly and really take the time to try and paint the vision the customer has for their own event. Will definitely use them again for my future events.< /text>

I don't even know where to begin!!!!
I was recommended by a friend about Exclusive Events and WOW they exceeded my expectations!!! the owner is wonderful and the person I dealt with, Jose, was just amazing! I can definitely tell that customer service was TOP NOTCH, super friendly and super nice, which made the renting process a breeze, and the delivery was exactly on time, and the guys who delivered it were very fast and careful while setting up the tables, chairs that shows they care about their customers!! I was impressed and Happy. I will definitely be renting from them again and will be recommending anyone who is having a fantastic party to go there!!!
Thanks again!!!</Text>

Wow, words cannot explain how thankful i am with Jose. He was so helpful with what we needed for our baby shower we were stressing out because we are not familiar with the area since we just moved in to our new home and all the party rental businesses were already booked luckily my wife found Exclusive Events by J Gonzalez and they were so helpful great customer service very professional, and  responsible business owner who truly cares about his clients he delivered everything at the time and date promised. I highly recommend Exclusive Events by J Gonzalez to everyone for your next event thank you Jose!🙏<//Text>

This was my first time getting a bouncy house for my son's birthday. The online reservation system was so simple and it made the process very easy. They gave a call the day before and also answered a couple questions I had via email. We got lucky and it didn't rain until the pickup time! We were also able to rent tables and chairs for the party at a very low cost! We will definitely use this company again and I would highly recommend them to anyone in the Riverside County area!<//review>

Great service both times.
I've rented tables, chairs, linens,Exclusive Party Rentals twice, and both rentals have been great. The ordering process was easy, the rates are reasonable, and the team shows up on time, with what we ordered. And the delivery team is nice, works clean and fast.😊😊</review>

< Review>
My son’s birthday party was a hit because of these guys, everything I needed they had! On time and reliable, above and beyond service especially when it came to the photo booth they where able to capture the theme we had in mind and blew us away with the final design, it’s the attention to detail that they bring that sets them apart. Would highly recommend.< /Review>

<Text>Luis and Fernando were incredibly professional and worked quickly and thoroughly. They took great care to protect my hardwood floors, and Luis was very helpful in answering all of my questions. I’m very, VERY pleased with the results and recommend them highly. And I’ve already referred them to a friend who has some pet stains on her oriental carpets. I will definitely bring the Lewis team back to power wash my front walkway and back patio.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Luis Torres arrived on time with a smile on his face. He quickly set up his equipment and began the job of cleaning my dirty carpets. He helped me move a couple of heavy things that I was unable to move when I was preparing for him. He was patient and willingly cleaned areas that I asked him to go over again.   He skillfully cleaned corners and areas that are difficult to access. He asked me several times to access the work he had done.   Luis Torres is an asset to his company, Lewis Floor Care Company.  I recommend them. They are thorough and professional.   Mary Rodriguez<//Text><rate>5<//rate>< resp>

With their work ethic, professionalism, and superior work quality, I wish I had more jobs for them, just for the positive experience! Service companies can be disappointing and often over-charge, but Lewis does what they say they will do for the price they state and you can trust them completely.</review>< pictures>

Lewis Carpet Cleaners was fantastic to work with. They were prompt, on-time, very communicative, easy to talk with and coordinate with, and overall did a great job throughout the process. Luis Pena was our main contact and he was gracious, kind, warm and very professional. Very happy with our services!< /Text>

I have used Lewis twice to clean the common area stairs and landings in our building. Both times they were professional, on time, easy to book, and, most importantly, did a fantastic job. There were significant pet stains on one of the landings and they were able to remove the stains and deodorize the carpet. I will absolutely use them again!<//review>

I have used Lewis Carpet Cleaners for over 10 years.  They do a great job on my area rugs and repaired them too a few times over the years.  Rick is a great guy, and pricing is fair.  Last year I had them do my tile floors and sofas too.  Both a great job.  I would highly recommend Lewis Carpet Cleaners.<//text>

<Review>The crew was extremely polite, respectful, professional and hard working. They listened and followed through with all my special requests. This is the 4th carpet upholstry cleaning Lewis Carpet Cleaners performed for us, we are more impressed each time and we highly recommend this business. I sent out 4 rugs to their shop to be cleaned, they cleaned it and delivered on time. There was a minor stain removing with one of the silk rugs, when reported Lewis Carpet took care of it within 24 hours. Thank you Lewis Carpet Cleaners team.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I initially gave a 2-star rating based on the original review below. Rick from Lewis Carpet Cleaners called and explained that they do not recommend removing the couch covers as they may shrink. The one spot that got left behind was most likely permanent as our couch had a lot of stains. Given how responsive and diligent the organization is, I am conferring the benefit of doubt and giving them 4-stars rather than take their rating down.

Original Review:
I loved the responsiveness and eagerness to help. They even gave me great instructions to clean the couch pillows and gave me a bottle of their cleaner liquid. They are priced very reasonably and offer honest estimates.

But, I had requested the team to take out the couch cover and separate from the sponge prior to cleaning it. I made this request 3 times:
1) Once with the cleaners when they came to our house.
2) When I dropped off the couch at the cleaners.
3) Reminder again via phone.
When the couch was returned it still had a bad spot as is since they did not follow the instructions. As much as I love their company ethos, this is poor quality work.< /Text>< user_id>

Such a great experience!  I was in need of a basic cleaning of my carpets in addition to a deep cleaning of an area with some pretty bad pet stains. It started with a brief phone consultation, an appointment made for the following day, a free in home estimate, and the job completely done....all in less than 24 hours!!  From the very first phone call, everyone was helpful and friendly and really made it easy for me. The scheduling was quick and easy, communication was great, and they arrived promptly in the allotted time frame. My carpet was pulled up in the deeply affected area and thoroughly examined and they showed me the spots where they recommended the pad be replaced. The pet damage was worse than what I originally thought, yet they were still able to thoroughly deep clean both sides of the carpet and replace the pad, along with doing the basic carpet cleaning in the remainder of my apartment. Everything was put back together nicely and they were in and out in just a couple of hours! Everything looks great, smells clean, and I would definitely recommend Lewis Carpet Cleaners.  Not only would I use them again for my variety cleaning needs, but I will also be scheduling a future appointment to have my furniture cleaned as well.<//text>

My carpets at home hadn’t been cleaned in six years. They also needed to be stretched because they were wavy and lifting in high-traffic areas. I found Lewis Carpet Cleaners on Yelp and they were highly recommended. I could not be more happier with the results! Friendly service, professional and efficient crew (thanks again guys!), and superb high-quality outcome. I’ll hire them again when needed. Thank you so much Carlos and team!< /text>

<text>Poor communication resulting in a waste of time.

After reviewing all details on the website and app, I had two calls with them to schedule my job and we went over what was needed: which was a simple clean of my 2 bedroom apartment before moving out. The day off the scheduled service I go down to meet the person and he says he’s there to give me an estimate?!

First I was annoyed because he showed up at 2:15pm for a 1pm appointment and at the end of it quoted me $250 when the lady on the phone quoted me 55c per sq foot for a minimum 250 sq ft. Totally wasted my time as they could have sent me a quote by email instead of having me wait a few days then a few hours the day off to get basic information down. Wouldn’t recommend.

Update: after all this I was easily able to find another company that cleaned my carpets for $150. They sent me a quote by email and arrived on time.<//text></record>

I had my white sofa and club chairs cleaned today. The team came in (with booties on which I appreciated) and thoroughly cleaned all of the cushions and the main part of the sofa and chairs. They look so clean and fresh now! After cleaning they turned some blowers on so that the material would dry more quickly (which worked!) Lewis Carpet Cleaners did an excellent job. I have had rugs and other pieces of furniture cleaned by them in the past and will continue to use their services in the future. They are both professional and reasonably priced.</review>

Both gentlemen not friendly when we opened the door to greet them. Didn’t say anything just measured the furniture and quoted us way more than what was provided over the phone with exact measurements of the furniture. Asked us to sign the order without explaining anything. Did not offer the scotch guard or other products for after care. Unfortunately, these gentlemen are reflective of the company so I am disappointed in the service.</Text>

Luis, the technician, is just so kind, hardworking and trustworthy where I know I’m not getting ripped off.  We’ve used Lewis Carpet Cleaners twice now and both times have been not only great experiences, but they sure know how to get the job done right.  Their pricing is very reasonable, as well.  Luis was prompt within the time window where I’ve had some technicians come hours past their promised window times with another company (won’t mention who). I highly recommend them for your carpet/rug cleaning needs.< /Text>

Lewis carpet cleaners are miracle workers.
They literally restored and raised my carpet
From the dead. Nasty horrible terrible stains
Vanished by the scientific care and expert
Restoration of this diligent responsive confident
Professional team. There are not enough stars for

We engaged your service to strip and wax a 700 square foot vinyl floor. Your expert helpers arrived right on time at 9:00, provided an estimate and got to work. They moved the furniture out and in and did a fabulous job on the floor. It looks as good as the day it was installed - 35 years ago. We highly recommend your service.<//Text>

Luis Pena did an exceptional job on carpets and furniture today. Little wonder this fine company has such a following with favorable comments and five star ratings. It’s truly remarkable to see a dedicated professional go about his job with so much attention to detail. And oh, did I mention super customer service???
Thanks Guy’s!</review>

<Text>My experience was ok I guess, due to the fact that my trunk was shampooed. I just didn't understand why I was given such a high fee such as 180.00$ just for the back trunk of my Tahoe. Its a rough time with the Covid 19, so you can just imagine how most of our funds are suffering. So much for helping Lewis cleaners right, but in return I feel like that wasn't helpful at all. Thanks for showing how your company shows great customer service. Never again! Stanley steemers all the way!!!!<//Text>< Pictures>

< review>
Just had our bedrooms, hallway and stair carpets cleaned yesterday. Can’t be happier about the outcome. Team was professional, timely, detailed. They protected all the wall corners from getting scratched/damaged by the hoses. Thoroughly soaped all the areas and steam cleaned the carpet. For the stairs, it was totally worth $5 per stair as they cleaned all sides very thoroughly. I recommend them.<//review>

Absolutely terrific service from a family-owned business. I've used Lewis Carpet Cleaners ten or more times over the past 15 years, and have always been very pleased with the service and results. Rugs always look brand new after cleaning. The staff members couldn't be nicer, and the prices are entirely reasonable. Highly recommended.< /Text>

I have used Lewis Carpet Cleaners for several years and think they are outstanding.  I have a large long-haired dog and two elderly cats (who have accidents sometimes) and I am always astounded at their ability to return the cream rugs to "like new".  They definitely do a superior job to other companies I used in the house.  And they are a pleasure to work with.< /Text>

You don’t get 66 five star reviews for nothing. These carpet cleaners tick all the boxes for great service, professional standards of carpet cleaning and value for money. Whoever hires and trains the staff has a great eye for choosing the right people to work with them. This business is worth their reputation.</Text>

< Review>
They did a fantastic job on our old ass carpet in our rental house. Juan was right on time and super nice. They use a combination of light agitation and a truck mounted extraction system which pulled almost all the water and grime out. They were completely dry in about 2 hours (65 deg outside). I didn't expect half of the results we got on these 10+ year old carpet. I will be using them from now on< /Review>

After the cleaning, there was a cat accident and they came back out to re-clean at no charge on Saturday afternoon.  I'm always impressed with the quality of service, value and most importantly the timeliness of Lewis Carpet.

<review>Was quoted a different price - ended up paying $240 for roughly 30 - 40 minutes  of cleaning ( additional fee was for puppy urine cleaner )  but was originally quoted $180 for the size room I told the rep on the phone.  That was a little disappointing, as we could do more frequently if better priced.  Techs were nice enough.  But were about 40 minutes late - no text ( not sure if they called - too many robocalls so I rely on text )   But - i have a clean carpet today .<//review><UserId.>104524851517145814410< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Lewis Carpet Cleaners was amazing! From the professional person who scheduled the appointment, to the very experienced gentleman that came and cleaned our 2 linen /cotton sofas. They were confident that they could clean the sofas well vs the other competitors that did not have the right tools to clean linen/ cotton sofas. My two sofas are like brand new! Thank you!< /Review>

Lewis did a really nice job on my rugs and carpet. They estimated the cleanable floor space accurately (they don't charge for space they can't clean like under the bed). I was able to work as I do from home, and they worked around me without incident. The price was very fair.</Text>

<Text>Highly recommend Lewis Carpet cleaners!  They have been cleaning my area rugs and wall to wall carpets for years and always do a great job!  Last year they did an excellent job cleaning very soiled leather kitchen chairs.    I was having my hand woven wool Persian runners cleaned at a special cleaners and I recently began using Lewis for them as well and the runners have never had such vibrant colors!  The technicians are professional and very thorough.  Lewis is the ONLY place for carpet and upholstery cleaning!</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Lewis Carpet Cleaners does much, much more than clean carpets.  They restored the gleam to our slate bathroom floor, cleaned and stretched carpet in a vacated office, removed kitty odor from a carpet, etc., etc., etc.

They have a heart:  We got to know Lewis Carpet Cleaners when they volunteered their services to Rebuilding Together Peninsula, an organization that rehabilitates and makes homes safe and clean for older individuals on the Peninsula.

Call them, you won't be disappointed.</Review><date>1595596419897< /date>< rating>

It was a back to back rental and Renatta at Lewis worked with me to get our place cleaned on OUR time (even when they themselves were super busy).  I can't thank her enough. Plus our carpets look terrific.   Highly recommend.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

we've been working with Lewis carpet cleaners for years and have always been very pleased with the quality of their work and their service. They have gone out of their way to help us with  various problems  we've had – often at no extra charge. Our carpets went from looking like they needed to be replaced to looking almost new this last cleaning. I highly recommend their work.</review>

The guys were awesome.  Very nice and helpful at explaining what was happening with my carpet.  Our off-white carpet looks fresh and new, and any stains previously there are gone.  It dried in less than 24 hours, even in the rainy weather.  I will be using them again.!< /review>

The BEST!!!!   I have used Lewis Carpet both personally and professionally for many years.  You will not find anyone else that will make your Carpets sparkle the way they do.  I have also used them for Marble Polishing and carpet stretching.   Don't hesitate..........Use them ..you will not by disappointed.

<Text>HOLY MOLY. Lewis Carpet Cleaners did SUCH an amazing job! They were super responsive when I gave them a call and welcomed me "to the family". Such great customer service!

I live in a 2 bedroom apartment on a commercial block of San Francisco, and they found parking without complaint and brought their gear in. After about 2 hours, it was like night turned to day. I didn't even know I was in the same apartment (and yes, it was that gross before). Spick and span -- the absolute best experience. I would not only call them again, but I've already told all my friends. Best carpet cleaners ever!</Text>< resp>

Lewis Carpet Cleaners is the best company to do business with.
My recent visit was to clean my heating ducts...and the registers.
Next, I will have my upholstery and carpet cleaned.  I have used their
services for about 15 years and they have always been professional
along with their excellent service.< /Text>

Lewis Carpet Cleaners are more expensive and do not accept competitor coupons. They did a good job and were quick. Becasue they were so efficient I could continue with my day. They protected the furniture.

I was very satisfied with the job,< /Review>

We were delighted with their work on our tile floors.  The grout hasn't looked this good since the tile was laid 20 years ago.  We plan to use them again to clean our hardwood floors.

I took a wool rug in for cleaning and specified no fragrances in the shampoo. I was told that they used a green process without the fragrances  I also arranged for a Scotch Guard type process for the rug. There was no doubt that this rug  had some not so good smells; dog, musty, rug pad, even some sour smell.  I picked it up a couple days later, first thing I did was to smell it.  I was very pleased, even a bit surprised, it basically had no smell, was clean and brightened. Excellent job. Lewis Carpet cleaners is for certain where I will go again for rug cleaning and who I would recommend.</review>

I was looking for a dry chemical company because I was tired of walking around with wet socks for 2 days... I found a company but after explaining about the stains they referred me to Lewis Cleaners.

I used Coit and was never satisfied - removed stains but 2 days after the carpet finally dried - stains came back.

Adrian and Juan were very professional and explained the entire process to me, they were even able to get out a stain from red wine.

I took a wool rug in for cleaning and specified no fragrances in the shampoo. I was told that they used a green process without the fragrances  I also arranged for a Scotch Guard type process for the rug. There was no doubt that this rug  had some not so good smells; dog, musty, rug pad, even some sour smell.  I picked it up a couple days later, first thing I did was to smell it.  I was very pleased, even a bit surprised, it basically had no smell, was clean and brightened. Excellent job. Lewis Carpet cleaners is for certain where I will go again for rug cleaning and who I would recommend.< /Review>

Very professional.  Came on time and did a good job.  I especially liked the type of drying that was done, so as, not to have too much moisture lingering in the carpets.< /Review>

<Review>From the person who answered the phone (Renata) to the gentlemen who came and did the work (Adrian, Fernando, Jonathan, and others) it was an excellent experience.  The recent rains caused a flood that did a lot damage and caused a terrible odor in our home.  Lewis Carpet Cleaners came out a few different times, worked around our work schedules and took care of our problem.  They really know what they are doing!!!  Can't say enough.  I definitely would recommend them.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

We have used Lewis Carpet Cleaners a number of times in the past and have been very satisfied.  This last time was a bit different.  We have new carpet that is almost 2 years old. We were scheduled for late afternoon one Friday and the cleaner techs called and said they could come earlier, which was great for me. It was around noon and I suspect, given their surprise at the size of the area, that they weren't so pleased and that maybe they would miss their lunch (just surmising here).  We offered them sodas and water, which they refused.  They were nice enough, but there were a couple red flags.  1) I had called Lewis prior to the cleaning and told him we had 4 FLOR rugs (in addition to some wall-to-wall) to be cleaned and asked if they knew how to do that since they're a bit different from other area rugs.  He told me that FLOR had just indeed called him recently to see if they could refer people to Lewis for FLOR rug cleaning.  I told him I was pleased to know that there would be knowledgeable people cleaning our rugs.  Well, when the tech guys got here, they had no idea what FLOR rugs were.  To their credit, they dug up some plastic tarps from their truck to put under the rugs in case anything leaked through to the engineered wood floor beneath.  They were very careful and all worked out well.  I had to print out the cleaning instructions from FLOR for the guys, but they didn't seem too interested.  Just glad it turned out okay.

2) When I approved the estimate, no other services were explained to me nor was I asked if there was anything else I wanted.  I assumed they would Scotch Guard at the end.  When they were nearly finished, we asked if they would Scotch Guard the carpets, they said they didn't have any in the truck.  ???!!!  The one man, who appeared to be the one in charge, said he was just filling in for someone and had to load the truck quickly that morning and must have forgotten to bring it. No offer was made to go get some.  It can only be done on damp carpets, so there was no way we could wait until the next week and have them come back and do it.

3)We felt that both guys were trying to finish their job asap, especially since they got to us earlier than expected, and were anxious to get off work early on a Friday, although they had one more house to go to after us. They also never left us any spot cleaner.  I only noticed the latter when we had Lewis come back a few weeks later and look at our stairs that still seemed to show dirt.  They did some tests and found it wasn't dirt or carbon emission deposits, and that it was probably just the shadows on the stairs.  We're still not sure about the stairs--but maybe it IS just shadows.They then asked if the cleaners had given us some of their spot cleaner and when we said no, they promptly gave us a bottle.

In sum, it all seemed a bit rushed, and sub-par for Lewis.  No ScothGuard?  Really?  No knowledge of FLOR even though I had stressed that?

I will use Lewis again, but if that time doesn't go better, Lewis is off my list.<//review>

I a very happy with the job Lewis Carpet Cleaners did for me. My hot water heater flooded part of my family room creating quite a mess. Adrian Vazquez and his helper not only were very personable guys but they came promptly, cleaned the carpet, dried them with fans, and then came back to treat the subfloor, install a new pad, and restretched the carpet. I couldn't be happier.<//text>

<review>I was frustrated that the cleaners came 5 hours later than I was told they would be there.  The person who made the appointment for me did NOT tell me there was a $200 dollar minimum and I was charged $200 for the removal of ONE stain.  I will never use Lewis again.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Two gentlemen texted me when they were on their way which I appreciated. They were very polite and knowledgeable. They suggested moving the rug to the driveway for cleaning which was a very good idea. Spots disappeared and they brought the rug back into the house and carefully placed it and the furniture that they had moved back into place with my approval. I always recommend Lewis Carpet Cleaning.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Response>None</Response><Review>As always I had a fantastic experience, I had to wait because I was a walk in, which I totally understand.  The emergency vet I went to could not figure why my dog's fever was high and could break it after four days with antibiotics.  Dr. Henstra as always came thru and fixed her up in two days, getting my pup in the right direction. She has almost recovered 100%.< /Review>< pics>

<user_name>K B</user_name><time>1621957705896< /time><Rate>1< /Rate><review>My family is very disappointed with the level of care given by Dr. Gil.

Our 15 year old dog needed a refill on a prescription flea medication. We made her an appointment, at which time Dr. John Gil informed us she needed a vaccine booster and prescribed her a blood pressure medication. Within 12 hours of her first medication dose and vaccine, our beloved family dog became very ill. She was unable to stand, panting excessively, and quite obviously unwell. We monitored her closely that night, and had to take her to an emergency veterinary hospital early the next morning. After almost two days in the hospital, we made the very difficult decision to put our dog to sleep.

Our family is devastated. Under the care of her prior vet, Dr. H at Alhambra Veterinary Hospital, all our family dogs have been healthy and happy. We are very upset that Dr. Gil prescribed an elderly dog a medication that rendered her nearly paralyzed, and ultimately led to her death. We will no longer be bringing our remaining pets to this practice, as it is clear that Dr. Gil does not possess the knowledge necessary to care for older pets.< /review><pics>None</pics>< resp>
{'time': 1622654154406, 'text': "Dear Kellie,\n\nYou are making a grave and damaging accusation in this review which is not fair or accurate.\n\nI am incredibly sorry about the passing of Kita. She was a sweet girl, and I understand the grief your family is undergoing. Losing a member of the family is never easy.\n\nTo shed some light on the matter I wanted to include more detail. I saw Kita for a routine visit on 4/29/21, per the recommendations of Dr. Henstra (who, by the way, stands by my care on this day and still works at AVH), checked a blood pressure. Kita had a history of an enlarged heart and was already on medications for her heart condition and severe arthritis. She had a history of a suspected autoimmune disorder in her back legs that left them scarred. As is standard in dogs with underlying heart disease, a blood pressure was checked since this can often be elevated in pets (and humans!) with heart disease. As I suspected, Kita's was EXTREMELY elevated at 200+ (average is 80-120). I discussed this with Kimberly (the only owner present during the exam) and informed her how damaging this is to ALL of Kita's organs and how it can lead to elevated anxiety, which was present in Kita. I recommended a more extensive workup (blood work) to screen for any underlying conditions to explain the blood pressure issue, but this service was declined. Kimberly informed me that she was nervous about starting a new medication, so I printed her a client handout that discussed the drug in detail, but in terms for non-medical professionals. I instructed her to recheck with me in 1 week. The following day Kimberly called my practice to inform us that Kita was not walking; we referred her to an ER as this was beyond the scope of what my practice can manage. At the ER, 24 hours later, her blood pressure was normal, and she was diagnosed with pneumonia. Unfortunately, due to the comorbidities, you made a callous decision. One that I wish no pet parent must ever make. I am very sorry about this.  However, I stand by my care of Kita and see no medical mistake.\n\nDue to your concerns and out of respect for your family, I took the initiative of having the case evaluated by a 3rd party. As they let you and your family know, there was no evidence of a medical mistake. My care for Kita was correct and appropriate. To be clear, I have no association with this company, aside from contacting them for a service. They are well respected in the field.\n\nYour attempts to attack my integrity and reputation are unfair. I truly enjoy senior care, and I have even done additional training in that specific field, more than your average general veterinarian. I do hope that once your anger subsides, you can see that what occurred to Kita was a terrible thing, but it was not due to a medical mistake on my part.\n\nBest,\n\nDr. John Gil"}<//resp>

<review>I have been going here for several years. Doctor Henstra is a great doctor. You can tell that she really loves animals that it's not just about making money she has a genuine care for the animals. Today I was in there and I had to put one of my cats down there are so good with allowing you to determine the time to do this. They give you time with your animal before they administer the shot. No rush very very caring. I can say that even throughout the years when I've taken my animals there she has been of great help in many ways, staff there is great as well this is why I go there the best for my fur babies.< /review><Rating>5</Rating>< GmapID>

<time>1594943379786</time><Rate>5</Rate><Review>I've been taking my two cats to this Hospital for several months now. I'm new to the Alhambra area and needed to find a new vet when I moved. It's always a challenge finding a new vet that you can trust. Every experience I've had has been wonderful. The doctor and the staff really seem to genuinely care about your animals. The clinic has a sort of "home town" vibe that I enjoy. The meds for my cats are reasonably priced as are the services. I'm happy to use Alhambra Veterinary Hospital on a regular basis for both of my kitties.

In regard to COVID-19, they have made adjustments and I feel safe being there. The lobby can get a little crowded at times but if I ever feel uncomfortable it is easy for me to step out of the lobby to be outdoors.</Review>< pictures>

The Vet trimmed my cat's nails all the way back to the root and told me the nail will grow back to normal about one to two weeks, but it has been almost SEVEN weeks after they fully cut my cat's nail (which I never wanted them to do, but they just did in their surgery room without telling me!!) my cat's nail never grows back again.......don't go there if you really love your pet. Plus, they also charge you money without telling you what they applied to your pet.... HORRIBLE<//review>

< review>
My husband trimmed my cat’t nail a bit deep and it was bleeding, so we took our cat to Alhambra Veterinary Hospital. At the beginning, the vet were very nice and checked his nail, says she will clean the nail and put some medicine on it. I trusted them, during the procedure, I heard my cat screaming (there is only one cat, and all other pets are dogs), when they bring my cat out, they show me the nail, they cut it all the way back saying this is how it works. I was confused because all the other vet (those vet I went before and the NKLA organization) told me never cut it all back because it connected to the nerves，and the it will hurts as hell. So the vet at this hospital saw I was worried about it, she took my cat back and said I will give him some pain killer. I didn’t know if this pain killer is really for my cat or just to comfort me and make me feel better... they also injected antibiotic 10 DAYS DOSAGE ALL AT ONCE into my cat.... But I really don’t understand is this really necessary to cut the nails all the way back? They just made it worse and use more medications to charge more money. I don’t care to spend money if it is a reasonable procedure! But I called 2 other vets later to fully make sure if they will do the exact same procedure, they all said if it keep bleeding then I should bring him to the vet, but if it stoped bleeding, then I don’t need to worried about it. I am so regretting that I didn’t called them at first, my cat stopped bleeding once I got to this vet... the front desk representative told me it will be more expensive if I go to other pet hospital, then they charged me $300... YES of course you charged $300, because you cut the nail all the way back to the root of it, and it doesn’t even necessary! they also claimed that I am not the vet, they are the vet. But then why you cut it all back when it stopped bleeding? The front desk told me if your nail clipped, you should PILL YOUR NAIL OFF! Are you a doctor then?? Does anyone experienced this, will the cat’s nail grows back, and most important questions, is this procedure really necessary?< /review>

Well if you love your pets.  Don’t go here.   We just  experienced our second death of our beloved  cats.  This time an oral dental infection that was recognized and told we will take care of this next month.  Then.  Trying to get that appointment  during this unusual time and needing the help of our doctor and her staff  we instead were unable to get past the very nasty Receptionist who had no compassion at all for us and only was interested in how bad her day was and expressing it to us by hanging up the phone in our face with our cats life hanging on the balance My scheduled appointment for the following day was apparently revoked by this unprofessional and completely out of line girl who answers the phones. My cat was will be put down tonight because this
Was my last hope and Ii didn’t
Even get a chance to explain it
To the one vet who already knew my cat and his
Rexords amd even knew about this
Oral infection.  SHAME  SHAMEON YOU</review>

Dr. Henstra is funny, full of wisdom, I think she's seen every possible problem with your animals.  The front office staff on Fridays...the best!!! Got both these cats from her...black and stripes...the black one has had weird stuff over the years...and she's dealt with it all with a sense of humor. (I've even brought strays here that she's helped out...but they mainly deal with your domesticated pets)<//text>

<review>I brought my cat in the other day it was late in the afternoon they weren't sure if the doctor was going to be able to see him because there were other animals before mine. I guess she took pity on mine cuz he was in a bad shape he had an open wound on his face with an altercation with another other cat.. the doctor was able to see him took care of him15- 20 minutes.. he was done cleaned up with sutures and shots ..  I was  happy to have him back in such a short time..  their prices are reasonable.. but really how can you put a price on your  pets...God bless them. .< /review>< pictures>

Presently I have  two 10 year old red tabby cats  and  16 year old gray tabby,  My good buddy.  They are caring people and teach you how to extend the live of your furry friend.

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Dr. Carillo, Dr. Henstra, and the staff at Alhambra Veterinary Hospital are fantastic in every way -- so caring, so knowledgeable!  We have been taking our dogs and cats to them for years!  Most recently, Dr. Henstra helped save one of our neighborhood cats that we feed -- he wouldn't have made it without her! -- and Dr. Carillo is currently helping save our beloved dog Nero's vision!  He had a serious injury in one eye, and it turned out that he had high pressure in both eyes.  We love the Alhambra Veterinary Hospital family!!! Thankful for all they have done for our furfamily!!!</Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c2c517695df2df:0x2d5b3285cc0d8094</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

My manicurist is not working due to the pandemic. I took a chance because I'm very picky how my nails are done. My nails grow up, and my regular girl adds acrylic on the sides to change their appearance. I did a walk in today and it started off favorably, but the girl, who spoke some English, started filing down the sides. I had to stop her from doing that. I told her not to change the shape. When one nail had a noticeable difference,  I asked for her to fill it in with acrylic.  This caused a stir! I was told if I wanted the sides filled, I'd have to pay for a full set! But she was the one who filed it off, not my fault! I'm grateful that they were open so I could get the fills, but very frustrated that they wanted to charge me more to repair their error!< /text>

I am VERY disappointed in my manicure. The nail artist seemed to rush through it and left them so ugly.. How embarrassing ☹️ I posted a picture. I also had a pedicure by another nail artist which came out great.. so mixed feelings about this place.< /review>

I was very happy with the helpfulness and the fact that they got me in there right before closing. These women are very accommodating. You want good people come here. I asked them to do a specific style they never did before and they were great. I'd add a photo of I still had them :( wish I did the review earlier.<//Review>

First of all, this Saturday was my first experience with this salon and I absolutely love this place. It’s clean, the staff is great, so sweet and professional. I feel like this is th nail spot for me. I came as a walk in and it was super busy but they sat me quickly. My nail artisan was amazing and very eager to make sure my nails were on point design wise. I mean he really put on work. I will recommend this place to anyone.</review>

Tried this place out with my daughter as a walk-in I was pleased, Nina was very nice to us! Wile being there I observed everyone else that was getting there nails done and they seemed very pleased as well, It's a small spot so the strong acrylic smell may get to you at some point😷<//Review>

Best hidden gem in San Mateo. It’s sad it’s never busy. Love how fast the food is made. It’s quality fast. Perfect plating and we’ll portioned. It’s literally the only Chinese restaurant I go for good Chinese food. I personally recommend this location. I’ve taken dates here and family. It’s amazing.</Review>

Almost threw up, dust so thick, gravies so thick and no flavor. Staff watches you like a hawk and just burps, scratching near butt areas and more. Definitely a zero in my book<//review>

Somewhere between 4 and 5 stars. They're really quite good with an extensive reasonably authentic menu. Relatively bare bones decor, but a nice dining experience and fairly priced. Easy to miss walking by.</text>

<Review>Stopped with hubs for a late lunch, at around 3 and obviously the place was empty.

Like almost every other Chinese restaurant, the menu is long and confusing. We ended up having the spicy noodles, the fried wings and pork mu shu. The food was all good and the portions are generous. I really liked the noodles, they different than what you usually eat at a Chinese restaurant.

Overall, good food, fast service and clean restaurant. It's not the most amazing Chinese food you'll ever have but it's pretty good.<//Review></record>

Great food. Nice ambience. The veggie pot stickers were pretty neat! The waiters and waitresses had a little difficulty with English but not too bad.< /text>

<text>I thought the food was great.  We had wonton soup, Kung Pao chicken and the shiitake mushrooms with bok choy.  Flavors were subtle yet delicious.  The waiter was attentive but left us appropriately alone.  I would go back!<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

The most horrible Chinese food I ever tasted.  I've been eating beef chow fun forever, but this was terrible. It had onions and tasted nasty.  The fried rice. Yuk. NO Flavor!!  $20.00 down the drain. Never go there again. I knew something was wrong when all the other restaurants were busy and not one soul was in there. I gave it 1 star because it looked nice in their.  And this was a busy Friday night!</review>

I love their food so much I often go there once a week for dinner (on my only day off). So this is special to me. Salt and pepper shrimp is always a must when I order. I recommend the curry chicken and wor wonton soup.<//Text>

< Review>
I ordered orange chicken, fried rice and potstickers to be delivered   It's been good before this order.  It was delivered.   The orange chicken was so tough we stopped trying to eat it.  This was on Thursday 8/20  On Saturday 8/22 I called to speak to the manager about the orange chicken. I talked to two people.  Both said I should have called on Thursday night.  The manager said he would give me a discount next order and kept arguing that I should have called on Thursday night.  What difference would that make?   So, now I won't go back.  There are other good chinese restaurants in San Mateo.  He made a big mistake</Review>

<Rating>4</Rating><text>Lunch Specials!

Those two words when put together just brings happiness. I came here with a group for Friday lunch and it wasn't busy. Their restaurant is clean and well decorated, it was pretty fancy. Luckily, they do not charge ridiculous prices unlike other fancy restaurants. We were greeted by a friendly server and immediately upon getting the menu, I looked straight for the lunch specials. All their lunch specials were $7.25 unless you got seafood then it was a $1 more. I ordered their mongolian chicken with fried rice. I love how you can choose the rice (brown, white, fried rice) at no additional charge :)

It also comes with a small salad and crispy wonton strips for starters. The lunch special was decently large.They gave a good amount of beef and rice. I liked the mongolian beef. The beef was chewy, not too firm and it had a nice spicy kick to it. The fried rice was okay, not really any flavor to it but it did come with peas and carrots. I did notice that their food isn't really greasy which is a huge plus for me! Overall I was surprised and happy with the meal. Our server was friendly and was nice enough to split the bill with 3 different credit cards with no fuss. They definitely get points for no attitude and accepting credit cards!

Great lunch spot and seems like a good overall place for any other time as well.<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Slow service on a pick up order that I paid in advance for 2 items. They served customers who came in after me first & let my Won Tons sit on the counter getting cold for 10 minutes or so while they didn't make my Mongolian Beef. Also based on the grade & chewiness of the "beef" is say overpriced as well.

Never again.</review>

Possibly the worst mapo tofu I've had anywhere. Chef's special Chongqing mala noodles taste like jarred fermented peppers with no numbingness at all. Crispy orange beef not crispy.<//review>

Authentic, delicious and affordable. Highly recommended!! Our top 2 Chinese restaurants in San Mateo/Burlingame.

Was browsing for new places for dinner in San Mateo. Found this to be near where we were for our chiro session.

Reached around 7pm and the eatery only had a couple tables occupied. We were promptly seated by a really friendly server.

Picked Seafood Pan Fried Noodles, Hot & Sour soup and Sweet and Sour Pork.

The Hot & Sour soup came first in a huge bowl. A little worried on whether we were able to finish it initially, but after taking the first sip, we were hooked. It was so good especially so for a cool evening. Before we know it, the bowl was empty.

The Seafood Pan Fried Noodles was done in a Hong Kong style, which is somewhat dry and crispy noodles. I must say the dish was done to perfection. It had a good amount of sauce that makes it so yummy with the ingredients yet not too much to turn the crispy noodles soggy too quickly. It had vegetables (done really well), prawns, squid and fish (though we felt the fish didn't seem that fresh) everything else was awesome.

Sweet and Sour Pork arrived shortly after the noodles. It is usually best paired with rice but the noodles worked well for us. The pork was also absolutely yummy, loved every bite! The taste was great, was perhaps lacking of some pineapples.

Service was great. We love how attentive the server was and how efficient they were. It was a very pleasant experience.

By the time we were done with our meal, the place started to fill up.

I really enjoyed the food. It has now clinched top spot in Chinese eatery list.< /review>

I love that he is very well in tune with the astrological part of everything going on. It allows me to make better sense of what I'm dealing with. His previous reading was accurate when it comes to outcomes and consistent with the 2nd one I had.<//Review>< Pics>

I have found a great place for my watch needs, he is honest and truly cares for your watch.

I have brought many watches here and once my watch did not need a battery, something was off on the watch and he was honest to tell me he will not charge me as my watch did not need anything.  I was shocked, and have come back many times since.

Great honest guy, and fixes it right away in person.  Prices are great.< /text>

<Text>When you compare SFSU to SJSU you’ll know, SFSU is more acceptable on all the parking and class enrollment problems. As a public school I’m very satisfied with the school. Nice location and faculties are nice. Nice experience here.< /Text>< name>

Ugh, I love this place!! I can't wait until I get to walk past this place every day from class-to-class. It has a HUGE selection of everything to chose from. Is a little on the pricey side, but the quality definitely makes up for it.< /Review>

Ahhhh, City Lights! Classic indie bookstore and San Francisco gem. Tucked away in Chinatown amidst a spectacle of neighboring night clubs, bars, trendy coffee shops and eats. It's perfectly grungy yet hip enough to satisfy any book lover's dream. What makes this spot so special? The history hidden behind City Lights and what makes it such a historical landmark.

Jack Kerouac, leader of the Beat Generation who inspired so many greats within the American literary, music and culture scenes has a spot dedicated to him right here... In Jack Kerouac Alley. The Beats, or "Beatniks" owe it to him, and the poetry room and zine sections in City Lights lay testament to that budding revolutionary, independent voices that make this shop a classic stop.

I've only ever spent a few wanderings in here while in the area, but I can easily see what's to love about this store. You can get lost for hours in such a tiny spot... And that's the most important part.< /review>

<review>Oh boy, I spent a long time here!  And took home 8 new (to me) books.  You really can't beat the prices, and as I wasn't looking for anything in particular I was really pleased withy selections.  A lot of the books are retired library books, but none of the ones I picked had stickers on them.  Give me a couple months to read today's plunder, and I'll be back!<//review>< Pictures>

No frill cheap Chinese food. It's a good break from the other more costly and refined establishments nearby. You can get a meal that feeds you for lunch into dinner for $9, really not sure what else you need to know.< /text>

Excellent selection of quality Chinese items .. the orange chicken is very good. I've dined at high end costly Chinese restaurants and China Express beats them all when it comes to their orange.

My friend and I came here because of the stars ratting on Google and boy did we make a mistake.

The rice was old and although we thought we were getting a good deal with the 20 dollar family value like the foods was... just not that good and sorta wished I went to panda express instead. Atleast the quality of food is better.

I felt like they just get the cheapest possible produce and overcook it.

Sorry you guys, but that was my experience.</review>

“Traditional” American Chinese food cooked and served up by the Cambodian staff. Great entres made fresh but best if caught hot out of the kitchen. Asian food wasn’t meant for heat lamps. Fannnntastic prices and generous portions. You will not go away hungry. Check it out!< /review>

<text>This place is very disgusting very low-quality and the workers especially the woman that has been working there for five decades has a really bad attitude.  There's been several times that I've came back to get food for work and in  some occasions found hairs in my food but that dosent stop her from giving nasty look and attitude.  Today  I ordered food for my foworkers and  I ordered orange chicken and it's stale and  hard. It's was really Nasty!!  I'm surprised the health department has it shut them down...  I don't think they're serving chicken but it taste so bad. Don't come here  you're better off crossing the street to Tosas instead.<//text>< Pics>

One of the best nail salons out here! ask for amy or natalie they are both super sweet & great at their jobs. The wait time is usually at least 30 minutes w/o an appointment.<//Text>

<Text>My regular nail lady went MIA and they said she'd be back after the lock down . I've been here a few times the atmosphere was better at the 60th st location than the new place still the pedicures amazing and priced well. With that being said nails were jacked now I need a fill what do I do... may request the owner before I say peace out<//Text>< Pics>

<review>Fantastic service!! I was getting terrible service at Deluxe and followed Natalie here! WOW! Fantastic prices, excellent service and wonderful work!  I can’t believe I found this hidden gem. Even better than their first Bliss salon a block away!! Super clean and easy appointment setting! I absolutely love my ombré nails and get constant compliments!! Hopefully you like this review!<//review>< Pictures>

Khoi was amazing! He did my Full set & pedicure by far the best in the AV. He takes pride in his work, he’s quick and was a pleasure to talk to. Highly recommend</text>

<Text>Such a beautiful ambiance when you enter, calm and relaxing tone thru whole salon. Staff is friendly, and do a fine job with customer service. Prices are higher (my opinion & for the area) but for consistent service I will definitely say this place is #1</Text>< response>

<text>We came in a week ago and this place was packed!  No social distancing,  we were rushed through our pedicures and gel manicure.  Not even giving the gel time to set under the lights.  Within 2 days it started coming off.   Raced us out for the chairs for next person.  No prices listed anywhere and cash only!  They are not following rules and someone will likely get Covid from this place!!<//text>< user>

<review>had very high hopes but the male tech did not seem to know what he was doing and instead of being honest and admitting he could not do the design with the add on he proceeded to just draw it looking terrible. i had to go to another nail salon so they could fix it. it was my first time there and definitely the last.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c25d127ddaabd5:0x9212b3bd66bb3832< /gmapID></record>

Vicky did my pedicure and I must say she did an amazing job. She was very friendly and had taken her time. Would definitely recommend this place of business to anyone.<//review>

< Review>
We went to get our nails done in a big group for a wedding. Everyone had a great experience except the bride. She told her nail tech what she was looking for and she told her she got it. She will paint it. When she got done putting acrylic on the first finger, she told her that it wasn’t what she wanted, but the lady told her that she already did it and can’t change it. Three different people told the tech that this is the bride, and she needs to take it off and fix it. She eventually took off the acrylic and got the one the bride wanted to begin with. But she didn’t ask he a single thing about how she wanted her nails, or what color design. She was very unprofessional and rude to her the entire time. It’s a shame because everyone else had a great experience, but we were there for the bride and she was not happy at all! So sad.< /Review>

Myself and a bridal party had a rather disheartening experience. Our nails look fantastic but the attitudes of the techs absolutely SUCK! The tech working on our bride to be did not listen or try to understand what the bride to be wanted and even worse, RUDELY rushed the bride to be multiple times to figure out what exactly was wanted with zero compassion to her clearly stressed out state. I am appalled by such costumer service received. Regardless of how good our nails may look I will absolutely be taking my business else where for better service, attitudes and overall experience. PS I turned down my mani service and will be going out of my way and making room in my busy schedule to get my finger nails done at my regular nail salon without nasty looks (for voicing that my bride to be bestie is stressed out and to take a moment to understand her wants).< /text>

<Review>Thomas is a great manicurist.  The other individuals will push you aside if a "big whale" needs a pedicure and you only want a little manicure.  Greediness is one thing but being obvious about it is an entirely different matter.</Review>< Pictures>

The original location is much better. This was a disappointing experience. The technician was very kind, but the other location did a much better job and for the same amount of money did a much more detail oriented pedicure.</Review>

<text>They took me as a walk in at 630 pm because their other location was too busy...And Im so happy they were. I got a much better fill and the staff was much friendlier. Definitely reccomending end Khoi he did a great job. Its a roomier salon with newer equipment and the staff made me feel very welcome. Was going to give original location 1 more try because I was not at all happy with their customer svc.
Highly reccomend this location.<//text>< name>

The pedicure service was great but when it came to nail painting I showed the woman 4 times the photo and she kept pushing my hand away saying “no I know.” Then of course she didn’t do anything resembling the photo which was ombré. I asked for it as soon as I sat down and proceeded to show her 4 times the photo. She then only paints my big toe and leaves the rest flat white. When I asked for ombre yet again and showed the photo for a 5th time she says “no has to be gel” and then proceeded to tell me it is an extra $15. So I agree. I was prepared to tip $10 because I thought she was going to do the simple thing I asked for after the 5th time of me being polite. THEN SHE PUTS ON MY SANDLES AND SAYS SHES DONE. She never even did the ombre???? After charging me extras for what??? Just to put my shoe on? Needless to say I definitely did not give her a tip and I definitely will not be coming back.< /text>

My first time going here today. I just went in for a basic manicure & pedicure. The towel used to lay my hands on seemed dirty He used the same towel for a customer that was right after next, and she noticed the towel, and actually told the nail tech if she could get a new towel. He seemed bothered that she even asked. At another point she wanted her manicure a bit well more presice, and He did not continue to work with her and completely changed the nail tech. I noticed the nail tech use the nail clippers on his own nails, and put them back in his personal pink box. I am pretty sure the pummice cube he used on my nails was re used, I watched him put it back in the box after he was done with my manicure. I noticed the techs go back, to clean supplies only with water from what it seems. It doesn't seem that they sanitize the tools they use the proper way. I have been to other salons that bring out new equipment every time. I wasn't greeted, and the whole time I was there it was just uncomfortable. I was very disappointed with their massage chair. I was looking forward to a good massage. It had no power. I am definitely not coming back here, even though they do good prices .You get what you pay for pretty much. I didn't even leave a tip! I am not the type of person to do this, unless the service I recieved was mediocre. I was cribguni insiei the whole time, thinking I should of gone somewhere else. I wanted to try a new place out. Disappointed.</review>

The pools, 3 to be exact are clean and the area is well maintained. The hot tub is huge and wonderful. The women's dressing room is big and has lockers, bring your own lock. I enjoy being a member.</Review>

<Review>I love this pool.  Ditto for my husband.  We enjoy their flexible Masters swim schedule and are especially fond of the coaches, who know how to give you a good workout without the tedium of just grinding out yardage.  The staff, without exception, is a friendly, helpful bunch.  All of this and more for a great monthly rate.< /Review>< Pics>

That guy is so genuine and I am at awe not only with his professionalism but how genuine he is. He makes me feel like I have known him for years! Every time I came I always got the chance to engage with him and this last time he came to ask about my drink and was out with it within a minute!! Such a kind soul and I will always come back not for the quality of drinks but the quality of customer service! Roger shines bright and always gives me this vibe and smile that lasts the whole day. To the Akers stand, you have my heart.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Wanted to see what all the hipe was all about. Let me tell you from the very friendly workers and variety of drinks. The drinks are really great and are so good. Definitely will be going back. Again I would say the workers made a big impact on how the whole experience went. Dutch Bros great job. 👍< /review>

<Date>1610469042953</Date><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>My wife and I decided to go somewhere a little different for lunch yesterday. We were surprised that there was not a line of cars going down Harbor for Cane's as we normally see. With that we probably did a U-turn! There was a fairly short drive-through line that was divided into two separate lines and merged. That strategy went fairly well for us to pick up our lunch. Returning home, our food was still piping hot and delicious!  Not a big fan of sweet tea in general but this was terrific!  To offer one thing critical, I wish the french fries would've been a little bit crisper; however, overall it was truly yummy!  Well done!</Text>< pictures>

Even though this place always has a line that snakes all the way to the street (especially if you come late hours) the line always moves quick and I have not had a wrong order yet. Plus the quality is always consistent. Not always the same size chicken fingers but thats besides the point.</text>

Limited menu. Fries, chicken, and sauce (tastes vaguely like Cajun remoulade) were all delicious. Price and portions were reasonable. Nothing to complain about really.</text>

<review>Their in-house thousand island is the best I've ever had! Word of advice, the four piece is just enough to fill someone up, for the great price of just $9 per order! But if you like a little more for later, or just eat a bit more than your average person then absolutely recommend the six piece 😊</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Chicken fingers and Texas toast are consistently good in different locations. The fries given are a small portion and I'm not a huge fan of their crinkle cut fries. To me, McDonald's fries are better. Their dining room is open again, but ketchup dispenser is broken and their ice machine can't keep up with customers. I don't understand the cult like following Cane's has. Their food is good, not great. In N Out deserves their cult like following, these guys not so much.</Review>

Drive thru had a long line (must be good food) but it moved fast.   3 piece combo was a perfect meal for those in the need of some great fried chicken tenders.  Definitely recommend this chicken joint.< /Review>

Juice and tender chicken finger, fast drive through. But is not my favorite chicken place. Very small selection of chicken, only one taste. If there is more favor to it it will be better choice for more selection.< /text>

This is my 2nd time here at this location, I ordered for 5 and the chicken comes out frys are cold on 2 of them I dont like it how if you order 4 pcs. of chicken you only get 1dipping sauce, I think you should have at least 2... if it were bbq sauce you could get as much as you like...</Review>

Raising Cane's is ALWAYS fantastic. If you have not yet tried it, do yourself a favor and GET IN THERE. You'll thank me later.</text>

I'm actually helping to build them here in California-Juicy bites of Chicken Fingers- the Sauce has a flavor of its own.

Simple food,  great price and resturants.

<Text>If I was for the food only they would get a five star rating but due to the fact that at lunch time no one was outside taking orders or helping direct the close to twenty cars in line. I probably was in line 15 minutes before anyone came to help the front cars. The exit is an accident waiting to happen when the line is on harbor. There is not enough room to come and go if the cars don't work together.<//Text><name>Robin Flores<//name><pics>None<//pics>< rating>

This place changed my life. I had never truly experienced amazing fast chicken until I accidentally went here 30 years later.

Somehow just as packed as In-N-Out, if not more, and gets the food out way faster. I rarely wait more than 5 minutes for my food after ordering, meanwhile every seat in the place is filled. I leave this place happier than when I got there every time.

Also, Texas Toast is the side I never knew I needed with my fast food. Remember to swap the buns on the sandwich with the toast!<//text>

Best chicken fingers anywhere by far. Not a big chicken fan but Raising Cane's is the only exception. Always hot, and never have I had an incorrect order. Lines are long but worth the wait.< /text>

The thousand island dressing is kinda like In and Out. THE CHICKEN IS KILLER! it is kinda like Chick filet but just tad more grease but a ton more crunch. I can't belive I waited this long to eat here.  Oh and the drive thru in Costa Mesa, CA you can fit a small trailer thru I was moving at the time of going here. Put this chicken in your face!!!!!<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I thought the portions could've been a bit bigger today like I've experienced in the past. Didn't get that much sauce. However, the texture is crispy and rich for chicken, a staple for cains to exemplify. I think it did it here really well as that's always very consistent.< /Text><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dcdf50ab31fa95:0xd109c2548fdd4db9< /GmapID><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHGuK6KIJqhyHSxRiogjmxnU8Qqz0s7Df5_fAA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><date>1596310293149</date><userid>101791872564024240894<//userid>< Name>

Absolutely the best fast food style chicken you could ask for. Whole, white meat tenders cooked to perfection. Coated in a brilliant, crispy fried batter, with moist delicious chicken in each bite. They only do chicken tenders, Cole slaw, fries and Texas toast, with their infamous Canes Sauce, which results in an incredibly consistent meal every single time.< /review>

When you only do one thing, you had better do it right. These chicken strips are really really good. The breading is perfectly seasoned, and the dipping sauce is right on target.</text>

<Text>Raising Cane's is the place to go if you want big pieces of juicy, moist, crispy chicken tenders with fries, cole slaw, Texas toast, and a sweet tea all in one sitting. I just had it for dinner earlier and my mouth is current salivating thinking about the meal lol.

Since this location opened, I've only had it twice (I usually get it in Vegas) and tonight reminded me why I love Raising Cane's in the first place.

Chicken tenders: nothing disappoints me more than ordering chicken tenders and it comes out soggy, oily, and has more batter than chicken. Here, the tenders are moist and crispy. Trust me, you'll want to keep eating even though your tenders are piping hot - I was impatient and nearly burned my tongue with the first bite.

Cane's sauce: can't figure out what's in it but it's creamy and tangy. Kind of reminds me of sriracha garlic aioli. Mmmm so good. Your chicken tenders and fries are incomplete without this!

Texas toast: toasty, buttery, hint of garlic. I love carbs so no doubt I love the toast.

I normally get cole slaw as well but since I shared my meal tonight with my SO, I asked to sub it for more fries and it was the perfect amount to share.</Text>< resp>

< Review>
It’s chicken tenders. Decently juicy, but still not a game changer that everyone made it out to be.

I always get the Caniac combo, since it never seems to let me down and that the sandwich is just chicken tenders shoved in between bread. Someday I’ll give it a chance! The tenders are always juicy (as they should be from a chicken joint), and the toast has an incredible crust with still enough give to have a fluffy texture. That being said, there’s no real highlight here unless you add in the sauce. The food is well executed, but is only seasoned with salt or that I could only really notice salt. The coleslaw is rather run of the mill, rich and a bit much. Writing about it now though, I’d like to slather that on the sandwich… Going back, the food isn’t bad by all means, but again shelling out 10+ for a meal for the cheapest cut of protein and starch is a bit much. It also feels like every trip I make, the tenders get smaller and I occasionally get an oily soggy tender.

This is a late night hot spot from what I’ve noticed, expect seating to get tight unless you’re here for lunch. Cleanliness is about there though, and the booth/corner seats are suited for larger groups!

I like the food here, but it’s not amazing. It’s just fried foods done decent.< /Review>

<text>Not a fan of their coleslaw so I always substitute it for an extra toast. If the line is long, park and go inside! You can be in and out by the they take care of 4 cars. That's not to say their drive thru service is slow. People ordering and paying are just a little slow and going inside usually has 2 cashiers waiting with no line. Also, enter and exit through the carmax side instead of trying to deal with the busy main street.</text>< Pics>

How the hell do they get so much heat and juice inside the chicken finger? It's still burns my mouth 19 minutes later when I get home. Delicious!<//text>

The food is decent quality for the price I would say it's reasonable but it's not the best chicken strips.</Text>

True this place is hard to get trough and has long drive-thru lines as well but it’s because their chicken strips are pretty darn good. They claim their strips are never frozen and you can taste the difference.

We got the Box Combo that comes with four strips, fries, coleslaw and a drink for about $8. The iced teas have the right amount of sweetness and welcoming on a hot day.<//text>

I'm actually helping to build them here in California-Juicy bites of Chicken Fingers- the Sauce has a flavor of its own.

Simple food,  great price and resturants.

The first time you go may not impress you, but wait! A few weeks later you will be craving more out of the blue and you will keep coming back for more. Some locations are better then others and specific times of the day the chicken is fresher. You have to go to find out. Great deal for the price!< /Text>

<Review>Unbelievable boneless "fried chicken".  I have never had anything like this before.  I am not a fried chicken person, but it is fresh and delicious fast food.  Always busy, but employees are sharp and on top of their game.  Have been several times and will definitely go back.  Crunchy and light...and comes with tons of fries and a "Texas Toast".  Coleslaw is yummy side, too.  It's a fish and chips with chicken!  DELICIOUS!!!!  🤗<//Review>< GmapID>

<Review>This is a fantastic place to eat any time! It's always busy but super quick so don't fear the line.
I prefer getting my food for here and people watching because it's always packed. The staff is always friendly and courteous, the food is always fresh and hot. It's no wonder so many people love it. The food is also priced super reasonably.< /Review></record>

<Text>Love this place so much. Has amazing chicken, and their special sauce is delicious and extremely unique. I didn't understand what the big deal was until I went for the first time. Now, I am definitely a regular. The only negative is that there are a lot of people and it is loud. But that makes the place seem fun and enjoyable. Besides, to me, that also means people love the place enough to want to keep on coming. Service is good and everyone working there treats you well and respectfully. Super happy with this place.</Text></record></dataset><record>

This place is so good. Signature cane sauce ftw. Fluffy, crispy, and warm bread. The fried chicken is crunchy in a way that you dont risk hurting your teeth while eating it, I feel like.<//Text>

Cane's it is... my son talked me into coming here, not a go to choice, but was willing to give it shot. Overall, it's definitely the hangout spot for the teens. Not my preference to dine in, but seems more like an after the game, let's grab some food, spot.

As for the menu, well, it's either chicken, chicken, or chicken; chicken fingers or a chicken finger sandwiche. I chose "the box" 4 fingers, slaw, and Texas toast. Food was pretty good, not great and not bad.

Between the long drive through, cramped parking lot, and the hustle and bustle it's completely not a spot I'd look forward to visiting on a regular. But, would say this is for the high school and college kids to take part in and enjoy.

Rating wise, I'd give the food: 7 out of 10, customer service 9 out of 10, cleanliness 8.5 out of 10, speed of order 8 out of 10, convenience with drive thru and line inside 6.5 out 10.</review>

This place is absolutely just okay not sure what the hype is! A little pricey for chicken fingers that you can pretty much get anywhere. And they don't have ranch dressing... Who eats chicken fingers without ranch dressing bring your own if you need it! Their house sauces okay but they charge for any extra. But apparently if you're in high school this is the place to be because it's always packed with high school kids just sitting around taking up tables<//review>

Chicken was very juicy and crispy but there was no flavor on the chicken itself. You have to depend on the sauce which I did not like as much as some others who have raved about it  the cole slaw tasted very fresh but again, no flavor. The Texas toast was good and fluffy. The fries are crinkle cut with no salt, which I like, but I like most fries with no salt.</text>

First time - fantastic, yummy.  Second time - super disappointing.  Fries were the size of toothpicks, chicken was small and sauce didn't taste right.  Gave it a third try and once again, the food was off.  Going to a different location from now on.< /text>

If there's one thing that Raising Cane is good at is their... sweet tea.

Oh yeah! My kids like the chicken. And that's what kids like--simple chicken fingers done well.</Text>

The only Raising Cane's in LA, according to my friend. Not sure how true it is, but the sweet tea made me forget everything else. Also, the only place where I would get ice in my drink. No kidding, try it. Even the ice is magical over here.</review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>First, I would like to say this place is different then any other chicken place I tried. This is actually my first time trying out there menu. I picked the box combo and in it was 4 pieces of chicken a pound of fries, coleslaw and a biscuit. The one  that stood out to me was there chicken the outside of it was the crispy texture,  the meat was soft and white like any chicken should be. I took a bite of the chicken it was actually delicious because the taste was different but in a good way. Everything else beside the chicken was good. I'm definitely coming back here to try the their chicken again. I would recommend this to people who haven't tried their chicken.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

For what they serve they're probably the absolute best. Soft, delicious white meat chicken fingers with bread, fries, and coleslaw. Keeping it simple and doing it well really works here!<//text>

We were so surprised as to how juicy the chicken tenders were! They need to Ikea up a spot in Burbank! Love their coleslaw and crinkle cut fries, too! Please open one up closer to us!

Stuffed myself, then passed out into a minor food coma for a couple hours in parking lot.  Surprisingly safe lot with very little parking though.   Super busy. They should put a tad more salt in recipe, that's the only thing missing.  Still 5 stars.<//review>

Literally the best chicken fingers I’ve ever had. They were super kind to me! My girlfriend forgot to order extra Texas Toast and I went up to order some more and they just said “No worries” and gave me two pieces of toast for free! It seems like a small gesture but man that was so kind of them.<//Text>

Very impressed with the chicken sandwich. The sandwich consists of 3 chicken strips instead of a single piece. One strip kept falling out until I figured out how to hold the sandwich The strips were tender with a  crunchy battered crust. Fries are crinkled cut. The line was long but the wait was short. I would eat here again whenever I am in the area. They are directly across the street from a chick fil a   They do not have to worry about the competition</review>

It's chicken. Fried chicken strips that are typical fast food flavored. Not sure what all the hype is when I can get chicken strips like this from most any fastfood restaurant. Overall, not a fan.<//text>

It reminds me of In N Out but instead of burgers - it's Chicken. Similar in the sense that it's a small menu but everything is incredible & they've both always got a lonnng line to wait in.
Again - It's still definitely worth the wait!<//review><user_name>Jake Benitez</user_name>< user>

<Text>This one is EXTREMELY busy all the time. With that said, they still get my order right EVERY TIME! and the food is fresh. If you are looking for a quiet sit down, this isn't the place for you. If you're young and like a crowd, enjoy the atmosphere!< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>Besides having to wait over a hour in the drive thru for their not the greatest food they allowed people that just pulled up just merge right in front of the others. The security guards was very rude about it too I don't recommend ever going to this place.

Admittedly I'm not much of chicken finger fan but IMO these are OK and the signature sauce is nothing to write about....I did like the Texas toast. That was the best part of the meal.</text>

Not your typical chicken joint. This place has a uniquely interesting backstory and serves Texas toast with their chicken meals. This location was the first one I discovered and has a reliable bike rack where I can confidently secure my bike while eating here.</Text>

The fried chicken is really great, just the right amount of juiciness inside and crunch on the outside so it doesn't hurt your soft palate. Their sauce is just the right amount of sweetness and tanginess so it doesn't overwhelm the great flavors coming from the chicken. Customer service is always great! Restrooms are really clean too. Keep up the good work!<//Text>

All the hoopla about Popeye's and Chick Fil A, well if you're in Orange County, try Raising Cane. Smells from the parking lot guide you to the register. It was my virgin run, but the food was very good. It was hot and fresh. Staff was friendly and engaged. The dining area was clean and not crowded, but the ambiance was good. Sorry did not see the rest room though. Plenty of parking
Overall, it was a good look. Only gripe I got was traffic, but the 405 was literally a stone's throw away, so no biggie.< /review>

This one is EXTREMELY busy all the time. With that said, they still get my order right EVERY TIME! and the food is fresh. If you are looking for a quiet sit down, this isn't the place for you. If you're young and like a crowd, enjoy the atmosphere!</Review>

Admittedly I'm not much of chicken finger fan but IMO these are OK and the signature sauce is nothing to write about....I did like the Texas toast. That was the best part of the meal.<//text>

Not your typical chicken joint. This place has a uniquely interesting backstory and serves Texas toast with their chicken meals. This location was the first one I discovered and has a reliable bike rack where I can confidently secure my bike while eating here.</review>

<Review>DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE THROUGH POSTMATES OR GRUBHUB!!!!! I ordered today, and when i saw my order was COMPLETELY incorrect (only 3 of the 4 cups had drinks and 1 cup was full of ice and they never did any of my substitutions) i gave them a call just to find that they refuse to accept ANY responsibility!!!! THERE WAS A HAIR IN MY CUP!!!! .....DURING COVID-19!!! Im sure the HEALTH DEPARTMENT would LOOOOVE to hear about this! They refused to fix anything and denied any culpability in the dirtiness and innacuracy on their end!

Great food, and even better sauce that won't make you vomit after 30 minutes like Carl's or Jack's will. Fast service relative to how many customers they receive, and they generally leave you with a smile after you finish your meal.<//text>

The food is ok kind of a bland chicken Their sauce is what gives it any flavor and be prepared to pay for it. Fifty cents for a small dipping cup. You get one cup with the 2 piece meal, one with the 3 piece meal, 1 with the 4 piece meal and you don't get a second sauce till you get a larger than 4 piece meal. They are decent sized pieces of chicken and they're not afraid to charge you for it but it is bland and needs the sauce. The coleslaw is ok. My fries were not nearly as hot as the chicken but they are really busy and I think they are made in  abundance to cover all the meals. The parking is horrible and the drive thru takes forever. Good to try but nothing special for the price.<//Review>

Nothing special.

I suppose there was too much hype leading up to my first visit.
Certainty not bad... but not amazing either.

I have to say i was expecting the same ol' dried up over fried chicken tenders. But we were pleased that they were still moist and the oil they were fried in was clean and tasted very well. I would go back again. The original 4 piece basket with fries and drink was a good buy.<//Text>

The chicken is always very fresh and hot. The toast is off the chain good. This location is very popular so it always seem crowded, the the staff is highly trained and the service is super fast.</Review>

<review>Tried this for the first time today with the family for an early dinner. It was tough finding a seat inside but did just as our food came up. Chicken was good but nothing to write home about. The breading didn't seem to stick to the chicken entirely so not sure if we had a genuine representation. Fries were definitely good, hot and crispy. Texas toast seemed fresh but not very Texas E. I might come back but certainly not if it's packed like I've seen it.</review><Rate>3< /Rate><Date>1550374110492<//Date>< Pictures>

Honestly it has been the best chicken ive tasted around...nothing compares to it. And if i loved the chicken i super duper loved the Bread and the fries are amazing...not too dry not too salty it was the perfect. It was like buttery at the same time but like the good buttery not the bad kind. Omg service was very like in n out which i liked it was fast and convenient. Deff will be coming here for sure again.<//Review>

The wait times and portions when its busy are both horrible. I've come to this location when it's super busy many times and i have noticed they are very conservative with the fries. Then I've come at not so busy times and the whole box is full of fries. I wouldn't mind if it was cheaper and had that little of fries but not when I'm paying about 8 bucks for the meal. Overall though, the food is good. Greasy and good.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< time>

The chicken is good but any place that charges you for extra sauce isn't really out for the customer. This place is even worse than the average stingy restaurant. In most of them you can make it through your meal if you ration the sauce but there is no chance of that here. They intentionally don't give you enough so you have to order more. Shady and underhanded. There are plenty of places where the food is just as good while the service is much better.< /Review>

Chicken was flavorful.  Texas toast was good.  Line was long but moved quickly.  Lemonade was a bit weak. ***Update*** 1/29/19 Chicken portions have been cut in half. I have been shorted items (chicken and toast) as well on separate occasions. This location has definitely gone downhill in the past month or so.  I will no longer patronize this location and suggest that you don't same.</review>

Me and my Daughter went to Cane's on 12/11/2019 Ordered our Food Approximately at 7:23pm waited and waited while everyone after us were getting their Meals before us. At 7:37pm approach the Counter once more and asked about my Order. Cashier gave me a blank look then proceeded to get a Manager/Supervisor involved to see what's going on with my Order. He went to the back/kitchen and finally got my Order at 7:39pm. All I got was a "Sorry!!!"... the Issue I had was the Same Cashier that took my Order saw us sitting down on the Bench across the Register in plain site. While she served everyone else, she never Acknowledge Me or my Daughter patiently waiting for our Food plus the Manager/Supervisor never said anything to us. Even my Young Daughter said "This is Poor Customer Service and Not Fair!!!"< /Review>

<text>Raising Cane's is consistently good. If you are craving chicken fingers and that amazing sauce then there is nothing that will quench that desire like Cane's. It's a little more expensive than most fast food but it's always worth it. I was surprised how fast this place completed our rather large order too.<//text>< user_name>

The cashier gave me attitude for taking a spit second and saying something to my friend while I was in line and they weren’t to busy. I didn’t care to see her name tag because I was upset but I can say you should check how your cashiers greet people. The food was great though.<//Review>

The food is good, chicken + sauce is arguably the best outside of Chick Fil A. However, their line format is inefficient and caused us to get line jumped by people behind us twice due to slow service at the cash register we ended up at.

If the manager is reading this, it has been scientifically shown that having a singular line feed into all available registers is more efficient because a slow register does not halt the progression of the line. Food for thought.</review>

TEXAS TOAST!!!  My gawd it's yummy!  Also, the lemonade with a splash of sweet tea.  Oh and the chicken isn't horrible either.  Drive through takes a bit but it's like the other drive through place that makes the food fresh.  You know the one with a secret menu.  Some nights there are kids from the college handing out codes to have a portion of your sales contributed to various admirable ventures.  Be sure to pay it forward and turn these in when you pay.  Cost you nothing and helps our community.< /text>

<name>Michelle Duffy< /name><Date>1579312462335< /Date><Rating>4</Rating><review>For my family and I, Raising Cane's is the best comfort food. The chicken never disappoints, it's flavorful and just hits the spot! I've been there at 9am or 1am, the food it's great!  My only dissatisfaction is the drive thru and parking lot. Not only is it a nightmare, it's hard to navigate.  Good luck if you park anywhere near the drive thru. The downfall, it's soooooo good, the whole city is there.  Which ever you choose to dine in or drive thru, plan to wait. The lines do not move quickly so If you're really hungry bring snacks.  Otherwise, the food is great.  The staff is great. Everyone always seems happy through all the chaos and seems to work in harmony.<//review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80dcdf50ab31fa95:0xd109c2548fdd4db9<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The Sauce...

Can't get enough of RCane's Sauce, it's amazing!

The fingers are always good, and bread and fries too.  Really want one of these stores in Sacramento area</Review>< Pics>

<review>There should be some parking lot attendant or something. The line is ridiculous at times and if you happen to park good luck getting out. Some people are straight up jerks. Greatest sweet tea in a fast food place. And you can't go wrong with the chicken. Love the simple menu. Grub!< /review>< pictures>

If you've heard of this chain, chances are you've heard good things. All I can tell you is everything I had heard is true. Absolutely perfect strips. Good white meat, not overly breaded and seasoned perfectly. Only bad part is there isnt a location closer to me.</review>

This restaurant served chicken tenders with fries and Texas toast. I only rated it 3 stars because they only have one choice for the dipping sauce. Other competition has up to 5 choices and even the small orders allow you to choose one sauce that covers the tenders and two dipping sauces that may be the same or different flavors.</review>

<Review>This is the In-and-Out of Chicken Fingers for sure. Simple menu, fresh tasting, juicy, and priced right. The bread is a lot of soft chewy goodness with slight crisp on the outside. Sauce has the right amount of pow to it. Good clean atmosphere. Good fast service with a surprising amount of employees. I ordered a 4-fingers combo and received it within 1 minute of ordering at the counter. And the place was 80% packed at the time i ordered. That's just crazy.  The only reason it isn't 5 stars is because i feel there is a lack of variety and ingredients used.<//Review><UserId.>115783047415636038224< /UserId.>< name>

Well Raising Canes is Raising Canes, what can I say. If you like it, you love it. If you don't like it, you hate it, and there's a Chick-Fil-A across the street for your preferences.

This Raising Cane's location is the only thing that is an absolute bust for me. It sits on Harbor Blvd, an already busy intersection but also sits close to the I-405 freeway, one of the busiest freeways in the region. Not only that, but because people go absolute nuts for Raising Canes, being on the farthest right lane just to get it, can sometimes be so backed up, nobody moves for 5 minutes. Not only that, but the parking here can be a little cramped, so if one person is just parked with their emergency lights, which I have seen plenty of times, the parking lot immediately gets congested because the line for the drive-thru.

Other than that, the food here is magnificent and I love the sweet tea. Nothing can ever beat my experiences at any Raising Canes.</Text>

This place is good. The chicken is pretty good, but the real MVP is the sauce. Not sure why there's so much hype. It's not the best, but it's not the worst.</Text>

<Review>Have been Caine's three times now. First 2 times was wonderful, nice juicy hot and large pieces. After second time went to Chick-fil-A and got 4 piece meal and was disappointed on how small the pieces were. The last time visiting Raising Caine's the pieces were as s as Chick-fil-A. Very dissatisfied that pieces were half the size they used to be. $8 for 4 small pieces of chicken is crazy.<//Review>< user>

<Review>Wow! When they told me this place only served chicken, I thought ugh... It was perfect. The portions are huge, that explains the not-so-small price. I really, genuinely, liked it. I'm definitely going back. The toast is to die for. Too bad the In-n-Out sized lines don't let me get my food quicker.</Review>< pics>

< Review>
Parking lot was a little gnarly. I parked and got stuck with everyone in the drive thru line when we left. Chicken tasted good but was just a bit greasy? Coleslaw was really watery and I had only one bite and tossed it. Last time I had Canes in Irvine was way better. I’m sure I’ll be back again - maybe just drive thru though. By the way there’s a Chick-fil-A across the street, how funny is that.<//Review>

The issue is the drive through lane, some people sneak from behind(gas station) and cut infront of line of people that have been waiting up to 20 minutes.
I leave this one star review not because of the food or the service , "they both diserve 5*"  i leave this review in hopes that something will be done to prevent people from cutting in line, i been to this place multiple times and i have seen it happen atleast 1 time every time i go  , drivers almost crash eachothers cars or fight in the drive through lane , due to this issue.
Some people just dont respect others rights.
maybe place a security guard or a sign. During peak hours.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

The chicken here is great, it always is  freshly made and hot.  The Texas toast and lemonade are spot on too.  The sizes of the pieces vary a lot some are a lot smaller than others.  Be careful because of the size difference sometimes the big ones are not cooked well.  I would back into parking spaces here because it is hard to get out when the drive thru is packed.</Text>

<review>I had the 3 piece with fries and a drink.  They have Sweet Tea, which I recommend trying.  Their dipping sauce is great, and the Texas toast is tasty too!

It's a lot of food though, I could have split the "smaller" 3 piece meal I got with another person and been satisfied.  The 4 piece comes with a side, which seems like just way too much food.

Definitely worth trying out.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80dcdf50ab31fa95:0xd109c2548fdd4db9< /GmapID></record>

I wish you guys weren't so far away, consider opening a place in Northridge. The sauce is boss! I usually get a caniac and can't finish it and have the rest later. Friendly service and your establishment is named after a beloved pet.</Review>

If you like chicken tenders this is a good spot for you. Chicken is well cooked, a little juicy. And the sauce goes well with it. The flavoring is nice, but a little light for me. Service is fast. Sweet tea is pretty good too.<//Text>

<Review>I have been to the Costa Mesa store several times and the food is always good. This day I went 9/24/18 around 3pm, not very busy but as I walked inside, I smelled trash...it was overflowing.  I was hungry so I ordered anyway. I sat down and the table was filthy, the floor sticky and noticed other tables with food residue still there. C'mon guys its not that difficult to clean up during the day and especially its after lunch your store should be spotless. I saw a group of workers just standing around not busy. Management needs to supervise or management needs to be managed better. My chicken finger combo was really good!<//Review>< Response>

This is a must if you love fried chicken.  South coast classic right here. Insider tip: ask for extra crispy tenders, get extra bread or fries instead of slaw at no additional cost.</text>

<Text>Great consistent food. The few items on the menu are excellent and executed almost flawlessly. It's chicken tenders and french fries though. I shouldn't have to hunt down a table or parking spot. I've been to other locations and they work well. This is just a product of poor location choice.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I love canes. I'm addicted. This place is usually busy. It has always been clean when I am there. The food is excellent and the wait time for your food is usually quick. Parking sucks here, but that's the worst of my complaints. The staff is awesome and very polite. I've been here several times and have never had a bad experience. It would be nicer if they had a larger seating area as it tends to fill up quickly. I recommend you try canes at least once in your life time. The sauce is amazing.</Text>

Chicken tendie heaven! I bring my own honey for dipping, but that's a personal preference. I also feel like the fries could really use a touch of seasoned salt or something. Still, they're perfectly cooked and delicious!<//review>

This is a must if you love fried chicken.  South coast classic right here. Insider tip: ask for extra crispy tenders, get extra bread or fries instead of slaw at no additional cost.< /Review>

Chicken tendie heaven! I bring my own honey for dipping, but that's a personal preference. I also feel like the fries could really use a touch of seasoned salt or something. Still, they're perfectly cooked and delicious!</Review>

The best part about my trips here is the quick, welcoming service. Unmatched without a doubt. I highly recommend recommend their lemonade. My favorite is the bod combo with an extra Texas Toast!<//Text>

<response>None<//response><text>This was the first time that I have been to a Raising Cane's and what a horrible experience. After waiting in a line that was to the door for about 10 minutes to even place my order,  my son and I go sit and wait for my order to be called. Keep in mind they asked for my name when I place my order so that when it is done they call by name. When my name was called I went up to get my food and the lady ask me for my receipt. I said I believe I threw it away and she said well you need your receipt to pick up your food. What kind of place requires the receipt to pick up their food when they asked my name so that they could call me by name to pick up my order? She then called out another order as I was standing there in shock and the other customer also came up and she said I need your receipt and that customer also stated she did not have a receipt she think she threw it away the lady did not know what to do and would not give us our food. What kind of service is that? finally we both said we don't know where the receipts are at why can't you just give us our food? Someone proceeded to walk by and said it's okay just give it to them. I was baffled by that experience. Then I asked for an additional sauce because they one they give is very small and the lady said I'm sorry that will be another $0.40 for the sauce and I have to get back in line. The line was again to the door I told her I have to wait in that entire line to pay $0.40 for a little sauce and she said yes and would not give me the benefit of the doubt or kindly as a one-time customer service gesture give the sauce, she was forcing me to go back in line. What is going on here?? This was the worst experience for my first time here.They wouldn't let me pick up my order after they called me by name then won't give me 2 oz of sauce without charging and making me wait another 10 minutes in line while my food gets cold. Completely disappointed with the overall experience I will never be returning back to this location or possibly any Raising Cane's for that matter.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Time>

<Review>Eh...it's okay for what it is. The chicken fingers are very greasy and very heavy which means they are injected with solution. Fries we typical, nothing special. Slaw was okay. Toast was very bland. Missed opportunity to make it garlic toast. VERY GOOD LEMONADE is all I got for positive.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

My first time here and the chicken strips are pretty darn good. I think I'd have enjoyed them more if they had put the great sauces I was told about. I requested their Cane sauce and honey mustard but none were added to my order to go. Great wings, disappointed in service. Wings taste dry without something to dip them in. Double check your bag for sauces before leaving.</Text>

<Text>I usually love this place.  Great food and sides. This time I went early and the chicken fingers were cooked but dripping with grease. I felt like it was dripped in grease and put in the box without draining.  A mouthful of grease made it inedible. Next time, I am sure it will be better.  Bummer.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I went to this location shortly after they opened. The chicken was chewy and the hot sauce was very mediocre. Better to stick with Ralph's tenders... much bigger and tastier, not to mention less expensive. Or just go to the best fast food chicken restaurant, Chick-fil-A! It's right across the street. What's the deal with Cane's anyways? All three locations I've found were built next to this superior competitor. Oh, and what's the deal with that toast? Is it in case the chicken and fries don't give you a heart attack first? I'll give it 2 stars because I was hungry and it appeared to be real chicken.< /Review>< UserId.>

So i have been coming here on a weekly basis for the past 2 months or so, and today my experience with the employees here was phenomenal. The food was great, and my order was called by the time i filled my soda and sat down (today a little less busy than usual) and about halfway through my meal the bus boy cleaning the table next to me offered to refill my drink, which is above and beyond his duties. I would recommend this resteraunt to anybody looking for some delicious chicken.< /Text>

Man oh man , raising cane's is my favorite fried chicken. Place , the only con about this food chain is that they only have really few location in OC . I love how crunchy the chicken is , how good their sauce is and how nice their employees are . Their drive through is always fast idk how they do it but even when it's really busy I don't feel that it took me more than a minute to order my food , pay then get the food and leave.</Text>

<Text>Great food here. Chicken is tender and not dry. It’s mandatory that you dip it in the sauce. The toast is also fire. And go ahead and add a sweet tea as well. Thank me later.

I miss living in Las Vegas and being able to go to Canes all the time...< /Text><Rating>5<//Rating><time>1516807727431<//time>< username>

Don't go here, go to the Tustin location unless you are going to be eating inside! The portions here when you order to-go are ridiculously small, 4 chicken fingers feel like 2! If you go to the Tustin location, they'll give you a larger portion compared to this location. I thought it was only a one time thing but I everytime I go here through the drive-through they give me small portions. Raising Cane's is good overall, one of my favorite restaurants. Also, the chicken fingers here are a little bit more greasy. They give a lot of fries though. Another thing, the coleslaw is almost always bitter so if you are looking for coleslaw and you like it a little more creamy then just go to KFC. I wish they could give bigger portions when you order to go and a creamier coleslaw. I hope they fix this soon.< /review>

<Text>Raising Cane’s is a must on our list of SoCal hot spots. We’ll even go out of our way to find one. If you haven’t tried it you’re missing out! But kinda like Chick-fil-A they only serve chicken so if you’re not a chicken fan you may wanna stick with In-n-Out burgers.</Text><pics>None< /pics></record>

My family and I were HUGE Cane's fans because of their quality chicken and flavor. We've been going since their debut in California years ago...but tonight was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! Our chicken tenders were TINY! This was the first time we were able to finish the box combo and also the first time we were still hungry after we ate the whole thing...
That's how tiny they were. We thought that they might have cut the tenders in half.
We are hoping it was just a one time thing. If they did knowingly make this change and are sticking with it when we try it one more time, we will not be coming back and we will definitely tell all our friends and family who we recommended it to not to go. We love the original thick, juicy, well-breaded tenders we've always gotten so we really hope to see that again.</text>

< Review>
More popular with a younger crowd and always noisy inside there from the open ceilings. Not impressed this time as they 'lost' my order and people who arrived after me were getting their orders. When I went up to ask about my order they did take care of it right away, but it is also difficult to hear your name called because of the noise level.< /Review>

<review>After passing by few times with ridiculous line of cars  lined up to get into the restaurant, I finally decided to give texas style chicken finger a try. As expected, I waited about 30 minutes before we reached the ordering windows. I ordered the box combo along with sweet tea to-go. By the time I brought the food home, maybe 10 minutes ride, the fries and toast lost their crispiness and warmth. The sweet tea I ordered was not a sweet tea at all, tasted like a blend and water down version of the actual sweet tea. The coleslaw tasted like it came out straight out from the can or something. The chicken fingers were crispy outside and nicely cooked inside. Their dipping sauce was what distinguished this restaurant from other chicken finger joints. For next time, I will definitely try to park and eat in the restaurant.< /review><time>1449183320396< /time><Name>hyuk kang< /Name><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

You can think of this as the chicken fingers of In-N-Out. But this place is a logistical nightmare. There's very little parking and you will fight with the drive thru traffic. Getting in and out of this place is crazy.

The menu is simple and the food comes quick. Personally I found ti good but not great. Ironically it reminded me a lot like McDonald's Chicken Strip but bigger portions.The sauces was good and so was the lemonade. The garlic bread was a nice touch to round up the meal.

Around this area, there's plenty of dining choices but not for chicken fingers. The effort it takes to make it here is not really worth it.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<text>First off, they need to do something about people cutting in line in the drive through. In n out is just as busy and they don't have that problem. Second, I order 2 of the 3 box combo and only get 1 ketchup sauce.. Ive been to the LA location and it's nothing like this one.< /text>< Pictures>

My first time here and the chicken strips are pretty darn good. I think I'd have enjoyed them more if they had put the great sauces I was told about. I requested their Cane sauce and honey mustard but none were added to my order to go. Great wings, disappointed in service. Wings taste dry without something to dip them in. Double check your bag for sauces before leaving.</text>

Freshest, tastiest chicken you'll ever have. Beyond tender. Unbelievable good especially with their signature dipping sauce. You have to try it, words don't do it. Friendliest workers ever & best of all, fast drive thru, regardless of how long line is, you won't wait long. I would give it open-ended stars if possible. Never met anyone who doesn't absolutely love Cane's! #raisingcane<//Review>

Upset at the service that I was given by the drive thru. They were very rude, the food was bad, and to top it off the order was completely off. These drive thru workers need to be properly trained and put into place. I will not be coming back here.<//Text>

If you have to have fried chicken, this is the place to have it. The french fries are ok but you have to get the sweet iced tea.< /text>

Amazing chicken! The service is excellent and the chicken was moist on the inside and good breeding on the outside.  The lemonade is excellent and the sauce is wonderful. Canes originated in Louisiana and I see why people are obsessed with this meal... It's absolutely wonderful. Definitely a must try!!!<//review>

No complaints whatsoever. Good food and there isn't much service involved. They will call out your name when your order is ready. Food comes out fairly quickly. the sauce and lemonade is something you must go for.< /review>

Generous portions of battered & deep fried chicken breast.  Well seasoned,  moist and tender - unlike  dry & tough strips at Popeyes.  Tasty mayo/catsup based "secret sauce" for dipping. Crinkle cut fries were neither crispy nor golden brown & delicious.  "Texas" toast wasn't crispy either and was Rhode Island sized. Go for the chicken, skip the sides.< /text>

Amazing! A absolute favorite! I love this place. They have excellent texas toast and I love their coldslaw. They only serve chicken fingers however. Their Canes sauce is a one-of-a-kind sauce that speaks for itself. Hope you enjoy this fine establishment!< /Text>

I love this place. The service is always quick and with a smile. Your food is cooked to perfection and, oh, that delightful sauce. If you like chicken strips, there's no other place you need to be. The Texas Toast is also a great addition and a bit of relief from the typical biscuits always paired with chicken.</Review>

<review>Stopped in here after a day at Disneyland. I have eaten ate other locations but the staff here seemed much perkier. For a fast food this place is really good. The box combo came (which I recommend) came with chicken strips, Texas toast, cole slaw, fries and really good dipping sauce. The strips were really delicious.  I really like the sauce and put it on everything. I actually took a couple home for later.<//review><time>1482440451505<//time>< pictures>

First time here? Try Cane’s Box Combo! I definitely recommend it to anyone looking to bite into something tender and crispy 👌🏼</text>

<name>Kevin Cordeiro< /name><Review>They have great food here, probably the best chicken tenders I've ever had, but they need to fix their drive through situation. Maybe add some lines and cones or a worker outside to direct the traffic. I'm sick of people coming from Gisler Ave and cutting the large line that comes from Harbor Blvd.

Since my above review, a month ago, the restaurant has hired a security guard to try and keep the drive through and parking lot in order!<//Review><rating>5< /rating>< date>

If your not into Texas toast and fries just get six fingers and do NOT forget the Canes sauce = 8 and some change. Worth every penny!</Review><time>1469320554010<//time><Name>Paul Auclair<//Name><Resp>None</Resp>< Rate>

<Review>I had really high hopes for this place since the line was soooo long (literally out of the parking lot!). It was good chicken, but just wasn't all the hype to me. The chicken was really juicy and tender but the batter was too bland. Didn't seem like there was any spices or much flavor on it. The fries tastes like the frozen crinkly cuts fries you make at home. Was unfortunately a disappointment to me.</Review>< Pictures>

I can't raise enough fuss about Raising Cane's. They make one thing and that's chicken. Crispy, delicious and tender every time. 5 stars for being the best chicken finger with a drive-thru< /review>

We love Raising Cane's and have raved about them to friends and family for years. We were so excited that there were finally locations in Southern California. Unfortunately, this location doesn't do the brand justice. The sauce isn't the same. And, the chicken doesn't measure up to the many locations that we have visited in Las Vegas, Texas and Louisiana. We are proud Caniac club members but don't plan on visiting this again. Definitely try any of the locations in Las Vegas when to visit.< /Review>

<text>Really good food and super lively place. Food is cheap, staff is nice, and the energy is very fun and loud. Only complaint would be the horrific parking when it gets really busy and how how hard it is to enter/exit the parking lot, but other than that would totally recommend to chicken lovers!< /text><rating>4</rating></record>

<Review>I waited nearly half an hour in the drive thru line to get my hands on one of their combos. Sadly, I can't say it was worth it. The chicken itself was juicy and delicious. They only use breast meat but as for the sides, I wasn't a huge fan. The coleslaw was bland and I honestly think mashed potatoes should be an option for a side. The Texas toast was decent but nothing to rave about. I did get their fresh squeezed lemonade which was pretty good. Overall, it wasn't worth the wait but if you're in the mood for some fried chicken, and you're in the area, give it a try.<//Review>< pictures>

We love Raising Canes. If you use the drive thru be courteous of parked cars trying to pull out and people trying to get in line off of harbor, it can get tricky if they are busy.</Review>

I was blown away by the deliciousness and the excellent quality! Plus they had my favorite hot sauce, Louisiana, upon request. Clean, friendly and I bet it's every kids' favorite place to eat...EVER. Please come to L.A.!</review>

I always go eat to Canes at Costa Mesa, tonight was awful!! My coke tasted like water and chicken was pink. Let’s not talk about the fries, I felt skimped out! The only thing I enjoyed was the bread, should’ve just bought the bread instead of whole combo!<//text>

<review>You guys NEED to fix the situation with your drive through where people come from the wrong way and cut into the line. It pisses people off and it blocks thru traffic. I've watched people get out of their cars yelling at each other about to start a fight on multiple occasions (this is not an exaggeration...they were banging on the car windows, flipping them off, yelling at them to get out and fight). I'm sure that's not the atmosphere you want right by your front doors. DO SOMETHING!<//review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>This place is one of the newest fast food fried chicken places to open up in Costa Mesa, and I would say they serve one of the best fried chickens! Their drive thru line is usually long, even at night. Inside seating is like a normal fast food place, but it could get crowded since it's a pretty new place still.</Text>< pictures>

The best! The sauce, the Texas toast, the tenders. We always order the Caniac meal and add a la carte tenders depending on how hungry we are. Each tender is $1.39 a la carte.< /Review>

<review>We were so excited to try this place. It was PACKED on a Friday night so we knew it was gonna be good! WRONG. All of our food tasted like it had been cooked in old, burnt oil. Yuck! I get that it was busy and they probably didn't have enough time to switch out oil as much as they should, but their food quality really suffered! Because of the many great reviews, I am willing to give them one more shot, but the food tasted so bad that I'm really hesitating, and waiting until I get desperate for chicken fingers on a Sunday when chick-fil-a is closed.</review>< Rate>

Supreme chicken here! Drive thru moves fairly fast. Only 4 items to choose from on drive thru menu. They are Nazis when it comes to asking for extra Caine sauce so I suggest exchanging the nasty Cole slaw for extra sauce in leu of paying $0.75 for it.< /text>

Food was great but the staff have problems taking the order of 4 people. (2 box combos, 3 chicken fingers with fries, and a chicken sandwich combo) Apparently this was too complicated she got it wrong multiple times.</Text>

Best chicken tenders ever.  If you are hungover this is your place.  There chicken tenders are the best blend of crispy, breaded and not overly greasy. Only minor down fall, no BBQ or ranch, but there special sauce is pretty good.<//Review>

Only fast food chicken restaurant around that charges extra for any sauce & doesn’t even offer buffalo sauce. The chicken is no better than the competition that provides free sauce including buffalo<//review>

<text>This is a great chicken restaurant! It is right across the street from a Chick fil A which is crazy, but I suggest that you try this place out. Parking will be tough, but the food is definitely worth it. It has a very In-N-Out style menu which makes ordering easy.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80dcdf50ab31fa95:0xd109c2548fdd4db9</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The first time I was introduced to Raising Cane's was in Las Vegas and since then I've been hooked.  It was only a matter of time before I had to visit their new location in Costa Mesa, and as expected we were not disappointed.  Probably the best chicken tenders and buttered toast I've ever had hands down!< /Review>

<review>I love their chicken, but I would find a different location. This place takes forever to get your order, and twice they forgot about me. 20+ minutes for chicken fingers, when that's all you serve is unacceptable. Oh and be prepared for a barrage of terrible hip hop music blaring over the speakers.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Pretty good chicken fingers.  There is no other choice, just chicken fingers. Different than chick fil a, more crispy.  Texas toast and Cole slaw is a good choice</text>

Was good when it first opened but the last time I went one of my chicken tender pieces was much smaller than the rest. I understand that it comes in different sizes but I feel like lately their pieces of chicken are getting smaller and smaller.</text>

I bought ice only. The food I'm not impressed I tried it before I got sick from this location the manager never returned my call,  I know I got sick from this location because I do intermittent fasting and this is only thing that I ate.   The ice is the best though.</Text>

This was our 1st time here and so glad we stopped.  Chicken was crisp outside and moist and tender inside. Employees were very nice and explained everything well.  We already have told all our friends to stop in the next time they are in Las Vegas. We'll  stop again next time we drive through Las Vegas.< /text>

Great food, only two things that bug me. Everyone's names being screamed out, I wish they'd just speak into their microphone. Secondly, the armed guards being used to direct traffic are both unnecessarily intimidating and incredibly rude to our group every time. Cane's should reconsider hiring friendlier guards, and not having guns on All their hips... Other than that, you guys have done a great job of becoming a part of the community here.</Text>

Awesome place.  They take care of their customer.   This place gets packed anytime of the day so my family decided to go to drive thru.  We ordered the tail gate 25pcs but they screwed up our order, we only discovered the discrepancy after we got to our destination.  I called the manager (Ted) and explained our issue with the order.  He was very apologetic and offered to either get a refund or get the order corrected.  I told him we were far from the location and traffic was bad and no way we would go back.  He said to come back anytime and we'll make it right.

We finally came back after 6 weeks later but Ted was not working that day.  I spoke to the Manager on duty and explained our last experience.  I kept our last receipt as proof but fortunately Ted, the last manager, had noted our conversation in their system so we were compensated for our visit.  Lets just say we walked out of Cane's with a party tray of chicken!  Not only we didn't have to wait in line that stretched outside but we got our food within 3minutes.

These guys are awesome! Not only their chicken are the BOMB, their service is excellent!</text>

Open late into the night with fresh food and decent prices. I would choose this place over Chick-fil-a any day. The bread is amazing and the chicken has some of the best dipping sauce.<//Review>

My kids wanted Chick-fil-A so as we pulled to Chick-fil-A on Harbor Blvd, as we did, across the street Cane's caught my eye, therefore I checked the reviews and it looked like I might be on the verge of finding a great new chicken joint. I liked the fact that the menu was simple, which usually indicates that they one thing really good.
As much as I might have enjoyed the crunchy batter, the chicken was a bit more greasy than I like.
I was excited about the Texas Toast, but felt like it was just cranked out fast enough to throw in my order.
Cane's gets much higher ratings on their coleslaw,  but unfortunately the coleslaw was just a small part of this meal.
If I was a teenager, I might have liked this a bit more, but the greasy factor is why I rated this just two stars.< /Text>

Not that impressed, don't know why there's such a line for chicken fingers. I tried it and yes if that's what I was craving and it happened to be right next to me I would go, but no way I would go out of my way or wait in such a line forchicken fingers.<//review>

<Review>Cane's is probably the top fast food chicken strips you can get. Better than any of the major brands chicken.

I still believe there is some kind of conspiracy surrounding Cane's. I have not found one yet that is not also next to a Chick-Fil-A and In-N-Out.</Review><rating>4<//rating><Resp>None</Resp><pics>None</pics><user>113513780269239174934</user>< date>

I had to repeat my order three times and they still got it wrong. The cashier fixed it, but no apology for the error. Food was consistent.</Text>

Cane's is probably the top fast food chicken strips you can get. Better than any of the major brands chicken.

I still believe there is some kind of conspiracy surrounding Cane's. I have not found one yet that is not also next to a Chick-Fil-A and In-N-Out.</text>

I never thought I would say this but this is too healthy for my standards. The chicken fingers are juicy, lightly breaded and not what I call fried chicken. The coleslaw is bland, and the french fry's lack salt. The Texas toast needs some loving, frankly it's overrated. Overall, I'll give them another try in a few months... Good try!</Review>

My first time here.  I ordered the 6 piece dinner to share with my husband.  I paid more money, got home and there was only 5 pieces.   The chicken was good, but it is very  disappointing to pay that much and not get what I paid for.</Text>

<Text>It's a good place. Alot of people rave about it especially college aged students. I find the chicken just alright. No complaints, but nothing that makes it super special to me. Prices are good. Not alot of verity in the menu. You are basically just choosing how hungry you are. Really easy and simple. I don't have a problem with that. But I go back to the chicken overall is just okay.</Text><Rating>3< /Rating><pics>None< /pics><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf50ab31fa95:0xd109c2548fdd4db9< /Gmap_id></record>

Food is great. They only serve chicken strips, even their sandwich patties are two chicken strips. The lemonade is a must try, their sweet lemon ratio is the best.< /Text>

<Rate>3<//Rate><review>Don’t have Raising Canes back at home and I really like it. Only gripe is on weekend nights it can get busy and be a really long wait time. Once someone took my order and the guy wouldn’t let me grab the other guys’ order (it was the same thing), the other guy was Mathew and I was Matthew. Waited 15+ minutes (I counted) and they finally gave me a replacement. No sorry, no compensation, just my order I waited 15 minutes for. Parking can be hard to find too.< /review>< pics>

Decent taste, although it’s not all that great. They’re on par with Chik fil A in terms of food taste but Canes is a bit more expensive. Wait times here are also “meh”. Good luck in rush hour.<//text>

Don’t trust the hype behind this place. The only thing on their menu that does have flavor alone is the Texas Toast. Everything is bland and has no flavor. Unless you add sauce to it.</text>

<Review>The food is always 5 stars the line that goes down the Main Street gives it four. The drive-thru moves pretty quickly but if the line is out down Harbor expect to be there in line for 45 minutes. Sometimes it's worth it though lol< /Review>< user_id>

This place is famous for their chicken, and I can definitely see why. While the prices are a tad steep, the chicken was the juiciest, most tender meat I've ever tried.< /Review>

Chicken strips were fresh and very good, although breading was just average (either breading at KFC is much better), size was quite small to good sized - varied wildly. Cane sauce was garbage and unedible with the strips - basically a poor excuse for thousand island loaded with black pepper. Fries were way too salty, bread was fresh but butter/spread had a slightly sour taste, and iced tea was just ok.

All in all this place is WAAAY over hyped and the strips are just slightly better than Carl's Jr (when fresh - can be hit and miss), but w/ the lack of available sauces I'd say it was a tie.</Review>

<review>I had access to Cane's every single day when I lived in Louisiana, where I attended LSU. After graduating in August and moving back to my hometown in Los Angeles, I did not think I'd ever get to have it again (unless I went all the way to Vegas), but low and behold, this location in Costa Mesa opened up and it has been a God send in allowing me to have my Cane's fix every now and then. This stuff is immaculate and I'm glad it's doing well so far away from Louisiana.

Way too busy for just a chicken place. Traffic blocks cars trying to exit from eating inside so they can point out even more how their time is more valuable than X. Traffic blocks highway entrance. Inside it is like an amusement park. Meals are a tad expensive but delicious. If you buy an arnold palmer, they charge you for a whole lemonade, (more expensive) only give you half of it and send you to tea, then wont give you other half of lemonade for a refill Palmer, why the heck charge me for a whole lemonade then?? Atleast give me the other half of what i paid for. Mom was smart and just got an extra cup to make two Palmers haha moms. It was not a fun experience but the food was ok, kinda understand why people would go drive thru though. Stinky environment and long waited service.<//review>

I drove from fullerton all the way to Costa Mesa, drove way past the orange location to save time. Orange is nuts.< /text>

They were polite and made it on the spot but having that be my first time experience I am a little hesitant to go back. food was delicious but service was below average.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

1st time at this location.  Good food,  but the parking is horrible! It's a very busy place. We came around 9:00pm and the traffic was ridiculous. Need a system with the drive thru like what In-N-Out & Chick-fil-a does to move the line along.  Otherwise,  food is good.  The sauce definitely made the dish.</text>

<text>It was in late October 2015 that the very 1st Cane's in California had opened. I arrived a day before that, and to my surprise, I was the 20th person to camp out. I already had a Caniac Club card from Texas ready, so by next morning I gathered my things, ordered a box combo and won my 1st "Free Cane's for a year" card, a free box combo card, and a T-shirt. This jump-started my habit of coming to order free food every week, which I've been doing for the last 29 months.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Drive-thru line is always long and spilling onto Harbour, but it moves quickly! You can only order in combos, but everything is great. I usually get the "caniac combo" and share with my boyfriend and it's more than enough for the two of us.<//Text>

Raising Cane's Chicken is probably one of the best fast food places to go eat at. Food is absolutely delicious (their Cane's Sauce is bomb af). The only problem is the LINES!!! The wait may be worth it but even the drive thru gets hectic. Chicken is bomb, long lines, but worth the wait.</Review>

<review>The food is delicious, but charging almost 50 cents for an extra sauce when I don't even get it half the time is ridiculous. Either pay more attention when you're packaging the food, or don't charge so damn much for something that isn't guaranteed to make it with the rest of your food. You don't see In-n-out or Chik-fil-A charging extra for their sauces, and you can guarantee those will make it in your meal every time.</review><user_id>114983282213896810495<//user_id><username>David Ganyo<//username>< gmapID>

It's all about the Cane's special sauce and Texas toast. That's why this place is so popular. It's the In n Out of chicken.</Text>

It also sells the best fried chicken you can buy at a restaurant.

I live in northern utah, but I make the 7 hour drive to Las Vegas (the closest location) as often as possible and I've never missed an opportunity to eat at canes multiple times while I'm in town.

Finally, the sauce is to die for. I recommended getting extra. Also make sure to get the texas toast (which you will crave for the rest of your life) "buttered on both sides."</Text>< pics>

This is a stop that we usually go to for my girls. The chicken tenders isn't favorable so you'll need to dip it with sauce. The girls like it so that's all that matters.<//Text>

This place is for CHICKEN BEGINNERS ONLY.  If you're from the south or Midwest don't come here,  you'll only be disappointed. The best thing was the bread and it's the type you'd use to make a bomb grilled cheese. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE RANCH.  It's very sad.<//Review>

Drive through is a nightmare when it's busy, the line needs to have an open lane for people coming from the Denny's side of Harbor or an employee directing traffic. I've learned to just dine in instead of navigating the drive thru. I initially thought the chicken was bland and was in dire need of ranch dressing. But after going a few times I've fallen in love with the Cane sauce and I guess the chicken being bland is due to how much flavor the Cane's sauce has. I'm not a fan of coleslaw so I sub that for extra toast and the fries are overly salty which I also sub for toast. Wash it all down with a lemonade, it's definitely worth the up charge< /review>

On this day I took my daughter for dinner, inside was a young man that was obviously on drugs he ended up falling asleep with customers and employees unable to get him to wake up.several customers approached the young people working in the restaurant but they just responded that he was still breathing. Finally I seen one of the customers call 911. Well police came along with an ambulance and finally woke the young man up..long story short ..the food is ok. But I feel that the restaurant having so many young people working without an adult has or can cause major safety issues.Due to major safety issues I will never eat here again..</text>

Raising canes is delicious and you can tell because it is always busy. This location does have the most seating I have seen but it still fills up fast.</text>

<Text>Restaurant staff members are not friendly at all, also the meal had one side only of cane’s sauce, the chicken fingers and fired were not hot enough, the fries and the fingers were served carelessly and fast and it were not cooked well, they didn’t leave any forks as well in my plate, I got to come back to ask one of their unfriendly staff for a fork, she handed me the fork while giving me a cold 🥶 look as if I came inside to shoplift the restaurant and without even apologizing for that !!!!!!!</Text>< Pics>

<review>Ok. The food...5 stars, its chicken strips, fries and bread, but they know how to do it. The dining experience...well, it's freaking packed. I came w my girls on a Thursday night and we had to wait for 15 minutes for somebody to leave so we could grab a table. If you like a place that's hoppin w people, this place is for you. FYI, they told us the drive thru is a 20 minute adventure, so plan accordingly.</review>< response>

I arrived a day before that, and to my surprise, I was the 20th person to camp out. I already had a Caniac Club card from Texas ready, so by next morning I gathered my things, ordered a box combo and won my 1st "Free Cane's for a year" card, a free box combo card, and a T-shirt. This jump-started my habit of coming to order free food every week, which I've been doing for the last 29 months.</review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

< Review>
The best chicken fingers I've had... chips were crinkle cut... reminded a bit of McCains... think that might  be a Canadian only reference... the special sauce was nice also the honey mustard went well as well... would have like to seen more sauces? Plum? Hot sauce? BBQ? Ranch? Only two plus ketchup.... although the ketchup  dispenser was mildly interesting... i think it was a pressurized dispenser..  came from a tap... cool... overall nice place and literally the best chicken fingers... still can't  believe the person ahead of me bought 100 fingers... lolz<//Review>

$1.19 for a chicken finger, you can't lose! 2-3 along with a $1.59 order of fries and you're set. I suggest taking the drive through... the walk up line is longer and takes longer.</Review>

Good food but the service is slow at the drive thru. Odd because their menu is limited to pretty much just  chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw, toast and drinks.  Also the parking lot is horrible. They need someone out there to guide traffic or set up cones. Im always ready to honk just in case someone tries to back out into me or if cars in the opposite direction think they can cut into the line.</Text>

It is very simple, but very good. There are four items on the menu (each one with cane's chicken fingers) and all of them are very similar. There are coustom orders and even buying their fingers in bulk for a catering event. The fingers themselves are quite good, but are even better when dipped in cane's sauce. Cane's sauce is the perfect sauce for chicken fingers tasting like a type of ranch with a cajun kick. Finally, their crinkle cut fries are amazing, way better than del taco's<//text>

This fast food joint is the best.. I like the freshness of the chicken, fries and omg I love the Texas toast thats the main reason I visit Raising Cane's is especially for the toast 😍.  I like the fact that it's open until 3am in the morning because I get off work at 230am so it give me 30minz to get to them.< /review>

So glad to get my chicken finger fix. Couple tips: sub the slaw for extra toast and mix in a packet of hot sauce into your Cane's sauce.</Text>

<review>The have great survice, the chicken is fresh with a great flavor, they make their tenders crispy, and don't miss out on their delicious bread, and make sure to get enough of their house sauce that chipotle Mayo is to die for.</review>< pics>

It's okay. A bit over rated for my taste. They basically only have chicken fingers in 4 variations in combo sets. One with three pieces and cole slaw, one with four pieces no cole slaw, one six pieces with cole slaw and one with three pieces in a hamburger bun with no cole slaw. Fries and drink included in all combos. Chicken nuggets for adults 🐓</text>

< Review>
I was hungry. I satisfied my hunger. But...I just didn't see in this chicken what everyone was telling me. Unfortunately, my chicken was soggy and greasy. Now, I like fried chicken, and I prefer a fried chicken that borders on dry. This chicken was far too moist for me. I expected the breading to be crispy, but it was soggy. In fact, my chicken plate was completely soggy inside it's styrofoam container. I went to eat a piece before i left the drive thru and was greeted with a soggy mess. Either the meal had already been in the container awhile before it was served, or Raising Cane's needs to reevaluate using styrofoam (esp. in environmentally conscious California). Will I return to RCs? Maybe. But, I will not go out of my way when there is Chic-Fil-A right across the street.<//Review>

Internally what you’d expect from Cane’s. Quick, clean, friendly and of course busy, but it’s ok since the people make it enjoyable.<//Text>

It's always busy- I mean it's canes- but it's ways worth it. If you're not the type to wait, this is not the place to go. But if you don't mind waiting, ALWAYS substitute the slaw for extra Texas toast. Trust me.<//Text>

<Text>It's was ok for my first time here the only two things I like about this place was the crush ice and that toast bread, well let me star by saying that the frys are just frys and they where too salty like the ocean and the chicken was ok I think they need to put more flavor into the breading and it would be the best place to go for fried chicken. I've never put rate restaurants but you need better frys and better breading please thank you for reading my review.< /Text>< pics>

What a Horrible fist experience, I’m staying at a hotel next to this place and walk in there with my service dog holding my dog in my hand Kevin to manager Mr. hotshot very rudely kicked me out of the restaurant and I was ordering food to go so I go back and leave my dog at the hotel and come back to talk to a manager and order some food so I can take back to my motel Since i really wanted to try it,Come to find out he’s the manager and he refused to take my orders gain  and very rudely kick me out of the restaurant again, So I’m just wondering does he not like me and being racist since I am Persian Iranian?<//text>
