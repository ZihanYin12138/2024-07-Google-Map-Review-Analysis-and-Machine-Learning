<review>Yessss what a game changer after having a kitty indoors. My rugs and couch are clean. Kevin and his team was friendly and efficient. I never had carpets cleaned before and Kevin helped me understand the whens and whys of prolonging the life of my upholstery.  They got here promptly, and we're generous throughout.</review>< Resp>

<text>LOOK NO FURTHER - Carpet Gigs is who you want to use. Amazing customer service, fantastic work, very professional, and quick response. We purchased a used sofa which was in need of a MAJOR makeover - it looks brand new now!! We reached out to Carpet Gigs for a quote and within less than 24 hours they were at our home. They arrived early, did a swift assessment of our sofa, and got right to work.  After contacting nearly every carpet and upholstery cleaning business in the East Bay, our experience with Carpet Gigs was by far the easiest and most enjoyable. We certainly made the right choice! We will be using Carpet Gigs for all of our carpet and upholstery needs in the future.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>I would give this company o stars if it was possible, this is the WORST Carpet company service in the ENTIRE world. On Feb 7 2021 around 6:30pm, I was scrolling through Facebook and came across a carpet cleaning post black owned. First he started by giving me a quote of $39 a room, but in the same sentence said he couldn't give me a quote over the phone until he seen the condition of the carpet? Which seemed fair and confusing at the same time! I knew my carpet was not bad just a little spots like the entrance from the hard wood to the carpet were there is most traffic. My son and I are the only people living in the apartment ,there are areas in my sons room and Livingroom that has never been walked on due to the furniture and size of the rooms. So I expected it to be a average cleaning. I made an appointment for him to come the next day Monday Feb 8, 2021 between 4pm-6pm to clean two rooms. He arrived after 4pm, he looks at both of the carpets now he says the cost will be $200. I was like wow that's a big jump from $39 a room. First sign I ignored I let him know that I was not paying that much. So he said he would do it for $160, I knew he was taking advantage of me because I am a single black mother living in low income housing. I wanted the carpet cleaned before the next day because I had new furniture coming. So I went on and agreed to the price (bad decision) he was done by 5:30ish. I went and sat in my car while he cleaned the carpet to give him space to do the job. He called me I came straight up. I was very surprised how fast he was done. I begin to see little spots that could have been cleaned much better, so I start pointing them out. He just kept saying once it dries it would look better. He left didn't try to go over the spots or anything. I opened all the windows and doors and had a fan running to let air in to help dry the carpet faster by 11pm that night the rugs were still soaking wet I put my foot on the carpet my socks were soaking wet!! I knew something was wrong then!! Even with it being cold and raining that day I left the windows and fans open and running until 1am the next morning. Feb. 9 Tuesday evening the floor was STILL WET, by this time I knew the rugs should have been dry. It takes 6-10hrs for a carpet to dry depending on the weather 24hrs tops. Feb 10 Wednesday morning I begin to smell a musty mildew smell the carpet was STILL damp. As the morning went on the the smell got even worst, the smell was coming from the carpet. The smell was so bad that it was coming out the door, the smell would smack me in the face before I could even put the key in the door that's how bad the smell was HORRIBLE! I contact the Carpet company I told him about the smell coming from the carpet, he kept telling me to give it some time and let the rugs dry, I told him three days had already passed the rugs should of been dry!! The smell was unbearable and it was during the pandemic lockdown!! He needed to do something about this now! Thursday Feb. 11, he sent someone out to deodorize the carpet. The Carpets dried 3hrs after they left the smell was worst then before. Due to the first carpet technician not drying the carpet properly leaving the carpets too wet caused water damage to the padding underneath the carpet causing (mildew) and a terrible indescribable smell. After many conversations he finally admitted that he caused this to happened but still did not offer a refund and once I demanded one he kept giving me the run around telling me to wait for the padding to dry and if the smell is still there by the end of the week he would give me a full refund this was on Feb.13th. He knew he caused this he admitted to it but still didn't have the common decency to even give me my money back!!! Tuesday Feb. 16 I texted him letting him know the carpet still smelled he responded saying he would or send someone else on that Friday to see if the carpet still smelled and give me a full refund. I never heard from him ever again. I believe this company is deleting bad reviews because the Carpet Company SUCKS!</Review>< pics>

Kevin was cleaning my neighbor's carpets while I was outside, and he came over to inquire if I could use his services. He was just the right amount of friendly, the right amount of hustle, and offered me great deal to clean the carpets in my two vehicles- and an opportunity to support a local family-owned business! Both cars look and smell almost brand-new now, I'm very very impressed! I will definitely use his service again, and recommend to others!!! :-)</Review>

Carpet Gigs did a fabulous job!  I had them clean both a bedroom rug and an oriental carpet in my living room.  Pet stains on both and they came out great!  so if you are looking for great carpet cleaning with courteous and fast service, don't hesitate to call them!</text>

I was really thinking about renting a a Carpet Cleaner from Home Depot and doing it myself. But I thought to myself I’ve got to go there waste some time, buy some carpet cleaning soap and In the end I don’t really know what I’m doing. So I told myself why not get a professional to come and take care of this. So I did, I called One Hour Carpet Cleaning and sure enough they were available last minute on a Saturday, and they were on time! Kevin the owner offered the best price and the fastest time. I really thought I was going to have rip the carpet out and lay a new one, not today! Thank you Carpet Gigs! You’re the best in the business!< /review>

Bilal and Dante showed up a few minutes early (with a courtesy call about 10 minutes before) and made my carpet and my room smell lovely again. While I love my dogs, I don’t love my room smelling like dogs. And now, happily, it smells nice and fresh again. Highly recommended!<//Text>

I had called to get an oriental area rug dried out and cleaned. I added a staircase and bedroom rug. The work was not spectacular by any stretch of the imagination even though the person doing the work put a lot of effort. The one that is supposed to be managing and helping with the work was pushy and even attempted to give himself a five star by reaching out and clicking the five star button on my phone! I will not use their service again mostly because of the pushy manager. I found it distasteful.< /Text>

We had a mold emergency due to a house guest from hell. Carpet Gigs came right out and addressed it and they were able to make a drastic improvement immediately. They were easy to work with and managed to improve a bad situation tremendously. I’m so glad that we worked with them.< /text>

I called in first for a quote to look around for mattress cleaner and this company was the first to respond. Lejeannia quickly called me back and was absolutely wonderful to talk to and coordinate my mattress cleaning with.

The team called my during the time slot I was told and was right on time and worked quickly and efficiently!

Bilal was wonderful to work with. He was very courteous, polite and friendly!

He was very professional and explained everything that he was working on.
Him and his team gave me peace of mind and did the best job cleaning my new mattress I could ask for!

I would highly recommend them for any service they provide!</Review>< Pics>

I had gotten my carpets cleaned by another company and one room's carpets developed several unsightly spots that we had not seen before the cleaning. These guys were here an hour after I made an inquiry, and finished the job with a spotless carpet an hour after that.< /Review>

<Text>My experience was good on time awesome results very nice staff!! Bilal is such a gentleman came to do my filthy suv in my garage I couldn’t believe how clean it got!! Just a bit disappointed bc they literally only do seats and the floor so after spending such a large amount I still have to get my car cleaned from what I’m told it’s not a detail only “upholstery cleaning” if I’d known I’d went to a detail shop. Otherwise the floors and seats look good as new!!</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Absolutely amazing and magical. First I am so grateful for the responsiveness of this team. I sent a message and heard back 60 secs later and was able to get same day service!! This team is a super honest and efficient team that will work with you to help accomplish a perfect clean.  My carpet was a tough one, 4 years no clean and it was a high traffic zone.

Bilal and Donte, were so sweet and attentive to the job. More than anything they were so enthusiastic about the transformation which made it even more exciting and thrilling for me. They took a trampled down, tan turned almost black carpet and made it look brand new! Even the texture of the carpet is amazingly soft and it feels like Im just moving in for the first time. Bilal  and Donte ,you guys did an absolutely amazing job, and I can't wait to have you guys do my parents house!! Highly recommended on every aspect of service and quality.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Do not come here for your vehicle, the first day I came in I got ripped off, and trust me you might walk in and talk to elmer and think he’s actually pretty nice maybe all these reviews are bogus, try saying that you don’t want any of the work he just suggested that came out to 3000$ don’t ask me why but that’s his lucky number. I have seen him tell the mechanics to pull out parts and clean them and put them back in on jobs that the customer had paid for new parts and actually even double what we paid or would pay for the part he’s crooked I paid 50$ each for used tires when I first came in. There normal price on used tires is 40$ each, anyways don’t believe the reviews just call autozone on tapo st. Or ask some of the other auto shops around, all I know is I wouldn’t let a person I hate come to this store and that’s saying something< /review>

Never go here. These people will overcharge you by hundreds of dollars, they do more damage to your car so that you will have to get more repairs, they are trying to run a scam, don't even think about bringing your vehicle here unless you want to have your money stolen from you. They also took belongings out of my car and refuse to acknowledge what they did. They will be out of business soon .<//Text>

Worked with Elmer and he flat out lied to us. He gave us a price and did the work and by the time it came time to pay it was 50% more. Do yourself a favor and stay away this business person is dishonest.< /review>

< review>
Sold me ires  , on my work truck , told me that rotations are included . Went in for my first tire rotation and told me that rotations are not included and wanted $100.00 to rotate the tires. Tried giving the independent local business owner the business and it has backfired on me . Not only are the employees/sales people not on the same page with the owner as to what is included , It also took them more than a half day to install my tires because they are not equipped to install large truck tires . My fault for thinking that they could handle it . Their fault for outright lying to me  .<//review>

<text>Honest & knowledgeable. Came with a steering issue, wanted an alignment done. The mechanic told me the alignment was already perfect so they weren't going to charge me for one. I had already bought & redeemed the Groupon, so they helped me figure out what the issue I was having was, let me take it home and put on the parts I needed, and when I brought it back 2 weeks later they honored the originally redeemed Groupon and did my alignment for free! I'll be back next time I can't do it in my garage. 🤣🤣< /text>< Gmap_id>

Dishonest! Dishonest! Dishonest! Went to buy a tire.  I was told by the clerk that it would take max 45 minutes to change tire and alignment.  Another repair person approached me and told me that two front tires also need to be changes.  I agreed.  The sales person "Memo" without information me left the building to go to Moorpark to get the tire while I am waiting an hour.  When I address the issue he became defensive and gave me the rational why I should have waited all this time.  Cheap way to make dollars.  Never going there ever again.</text>

< review>
Went for a simple oil change.  They pulled and ripped apart the engine guard or cover and didn't put back properly.  After oil change, huge noise,  took it back.  They wanted to $120 to fix all the broken tabs which they broke.  They said the noise is coming from bad bearing told me $900 to fix everything.  Car is still not running smooth.  I had to take it to another mechanic to get it fixed.  I will not take any of my cars here any more.  I don't trust.  They also drove my car over 60 miles.  I had noted the mileage when I gave the car and noticed they used it to go places.  Not honest<//review>

<Text>Good, friendly home town service at fair prices. Got brakes on a Mercedes-Benz based on referral from a friend who's taken multiple cars there. They dropped me off and picked me up when the car was ready. While in the lobby, another customer shared how pleased she was with the shop and that she was also a returning customer. That says a lot about a car shop and now I'm on their list of happy customers, too.<//Text>< pics>

I went in with a flat tire and the owner Elmer checked out all the other 3 tires and noticed the tread was good but explained to me how dangerous it was to drive on tires with sidewalls that had bad sun damage like mine. I didn't know as it was a used car. Elmer made intelligent sense and I looked in my phone which told me I could have died driving on those tires as he set me up with a great deal on 4 Hankook tires with balancing and alignment. I saved good money and Elmer's Kings Tires saved my life and all was great. My car by the way handles like a dream now. I Will recommend Elmer's Kings Tires to all.<//Text>

WARNING TO ALL AUTO PARTS AND CAR DEALERS. Elmer's Tire & Automotive's checks are no good   He purchased a 2011 Nissan Altima engine with a NSF check (non sufficient funds) and has promised to come "tomorrow" with the full amount in cash for the past 40 days. I was the sales person, we dont normally except checks but I trusted him as a fellow businessman,  not only I didn't get commission but the bad check was taken out of my paycheck.<//text>

<review>Elmar's is a very Incompetent and dishonest mechanic. I took my truck to have a left installed. They took the truck a part and could not put it back together. I inspected the truck with Elmar prior to leaving his shop. I stopped by the shop several time to check. They could not finish the job and gave me the truck back to go somewhere else to get the work done. Bunch of lights showed up on the dash, the car was misaligned. This is the worst experience you could go through!.< /review>< Time>

Wish there was some way I could give zero stars. All the reviews listed with one star on Yelp pretty much say it all. They are liars and this place is a scam. Over the phone the woman gave me a quote of $105 per tire and told me they could have it done that day. Well that was they're first lie, when my husband got there they said it wouldnt be ready until the next day and to come anytime after 9am. So I went the next day at 10:30am to pick them up and they weren't even started yet, that was the second lie. He told me to come back in 30 mins. I didnt believe that so I went back later that afternoon. Well here's where we get really pissed. When my husband went to drop them off he told them he wanted to pay the full amount that day. So they charged the $210 for the tires. Well to my surprise when I picked them up it was going to be another $145. What? Another LIE!! Okay they're just a bunch of liars and continue to lie to your face, he even had the audacity to tell me that I was the liar and he told me he told her that price and it was going to be that much. Long story short, I'm warning you like the other people that wrote reviews, these people are liars and will scam you. Be careful.</Text>< rating>

If you are bringing a Groupon don't expect much from them or as the guy put it, "its a Groupon man"......zero customer service (very pleasant with the previous customer but not the Groupon guy) or any kind of support on the work they do because its not like you paid any money for the Groupon right to deserve some kind of warranty on their work (even a fraction of the regular warranty would make the difference). These shops love to bring in the money from the thousands and thousand of Groupons they sell but when it comes to doing the actual work its no longer pleasant. Wait time was also double what they said it would be.< /Text>

Tim the service writer (I didn't get his last name but Corp will know who he is lol) was super helpful, very friendly and communicated any changes to the pricing that was initially quoted.

Work was done pretty quickly... I didn't have to wait very long for my truck to get an oil change and brake job.

If you need an oil change or brakes, this is where you should go.

**** DEFINITELY GOING BACK ****
It's a little out of the way, but definitely worth the drive. Oh and by the way, the bench outside... love it.<//text>

The overall experience was very customer friendly.  The explanation of the work that needed to be done was explained in detail & so I understood what needed to be done & why.

I was pleasantly surprised when the manager offered to call Lyft & split the cost of sending me home to wait while the work was being done & bringing me back when the work was complete.

When I came to pick up my vehicle the manager throughly explained what they had done so that I was able to understand what they had done.

I would highly recommend this location to anyone.<//text>

First time coming here instead of Toyota for an oil change. But it was a mistake. Made an appointment on 8/20/20 at 11am for an oil change and was told it would take an hour. It ended up taking two hours and they broke my canister for my oil filter. Then charged me $38 for a new one. At least they gave me 10% off for a military discount. Definitely never coming back here again.</text>

I don’t know how this shop doesn’t have a 5 star review - I had a great experience. I got a flat tire within an hour of them closing, but called and Ricky reassured me he would do what he could even if It meant staying after closing. He was able to get it fixed in no time and gave me tips on how to prevent this situation in the future. His excellent customer service was clearly not just about doing a good job, it came from being passionate about helping people. It’s cheesy but both my car and I left in a better shape. Thank you!!!</review>

<review>I had my 2003 Toyota camry stopped at the traffic intersection and had to tow my car to this location. Next day they called me and told they had replaced the battery and the car is good to go. When the technician handed over the keys he told RPM reading is low and i may have to drive for few miles to get the system reset. After travelling for 3 miles car stopped again. I was 0.6 miles away from this store, but they want me to tow it again. I expect them to at least do a test drive to make sure everything is fine instead of saying everything is good to pickup the car. Now they want me to pay 90$ more to diagnose and find the issue further after i paid 200$ on the first repair. This is insane. Please stop looting the customers. Try to investigate properly the first time and give an estimate. I would never recommend anyone to go this store. They are not fully qualified. I even spoke with their manager and he could be of no help.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I purchased a vehicle and at that time I also bought the Pep Boys maintenance plan. I brought my vehicle into this location two days ago for the first oil change on the plan. Was told that whomever did the last oil change (I have no way of knowing who) put the plug in incorrectly and now I would need a whole new oil pan (about $600!!). I said no and brought it to MY mechanic (Steve's Small Car Repair in Orangevale, CA). I did NOT need a new oil pan; only a new PLUG ($30!!!). The lady before me was told that she had to replace ALL of her tires at once because she had an all-wheel-drive vehicle, and if she wouldn't do all four they couldn't help her. All because of a slow leak in ONE TIRE. I regret buying the PB maintenance plan, because now I will NEVER get to use it. I do not trust these people as they are CLEARLY trying to defraud and take advantage of women. Pep Boys will NEVER touch a vehicle I own EVER again.< /Text>

I'd needed just a replacement headlight. It was a busy Sunday and they were short staffed that day with their mechanics out on lunch breaks. The head mechanic/register guy was very helpful and rather than asking me to wait in order of cars (for hours), he changed the bulb himself; and even showed me the how Tom's about doing it. Thanks!<//text>

Had my tire fixed here in the past. Pretty good price overall. Although the time I had a brake job they found a bunch of stuff that was wrong with it that needed to be fixed on top of that. Although I refused to have the other problems fixed they said they couldn't just do the brake job without addressing the other issues. Went from being a $300 - $1300 job.<//text>

<Review>They suck I had a flat tire and was on my spare (donut) and I'm on a WALKING CANE I ask could I get a tire put on she said there was no one there
So I ask could I but a tire she said yes she told me the price which was fine she came out looked at the tire to get the size. Long story short She need more customer service training soon you all are going to lose a lot of business with employees like that. And that's what can make or break a company. I won't be returning.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1546143687738, 'text': 'We apologize that you had a poor experience.

Their rebate offer is a scam. Our rebate debit card was decline for no reason so we just walked out without purchasing their product. The expiration date was still effective until and through the month of April 2019. Never stepping foot in there again.</text>

After multiple trips to car dealerships and auto shops for regular maintenance, problems were stemming due to negligence in quality of service. NO ONE enjoys having their morning haunted due to a dead battery. This happened, I had to have my car towed and it was taken to this Pep Boys location in Rancho Cordova. They installed the battery before asking which one I wanted then said it was too late to change it now - and of course, it was the MOST expensive on the shelf. The FOLLOWING week, my car was showing low voltage, my car stalled then stopped at Madison and Hazel. I watched the voltage and it continued to fluctuate from 12.5 to 14.0. The week after that, it would stall and stop to where I gave up and took it back to discuss this with someone. The tech had left my terminals and battery cables FILTHY, and the lady was trying to convince me they were clean. She continued to be very rude and unhelpful so I took my car to the Buick dealership where they confirmed all of the issues that Pep Boys denied. Don't go here, pay the extra money to go to the dealership.< /Text>

We were told it was the dorman window reg with motor. That it would cost $545.00 to remove and replace the window regulator (per the receipt given to us). My friend declined,  and informed them, that she would go and get a 2nd opinion and go to the car dealership to get it fix. Jessica at Pep Boys,  informed us, "that Pep Boys prices are better, and cheaper than the Dealership." My friend called her insurance provider. They told her to go to Safelite, we did, and was informed that it was the SWITCH, and not the MOTOR. The cost was $142.42 for safelite to order the switch, and fix the car. That is a $402.58 difference.  We went back to Pep Boys today to complained. That the mechanic did not need to touch anything, but the window.  My friend wanted her money back. The mechanic checked their system and saw that for her car needs to be maintaining,  due to the fact her car is over 90,000 miles. We knew that. All that was needed was for the window to be fix. My friend paid $44.99 that she wanted back. Spoke to James today, the Mgr. he informed her that Pep Boys prices are about the same as the dealer, and Safelite is cheaper because all they do are windows. He was informed that was ALL she want him to touch. The part was $84.00, the labor was $50.00. After taxs, the price was $142.42. I understand other Company may price differently.  But a $402.58 difference, i dont think so. As a matter of fact, the mechanic needs to go back to school. My friend is reporting Pep Boys to the BBB, and the Bureau of Automotive Repair.</Text>< rate>

My check engine light came on, so I wanted to find out what's wrong with it. I called the Rancho location and asked if they do diagnostics. She said they do, and I told them I need it because the light came on. She says " I can run it, and give you the code. But I can't tell you what's wrong with it. I can just give you the code." How does that help me?</text>

We've been coming here previously mainly because it was convenient (we live super close by) however each time the service gets worse and worse. First and foremost, it takes literally ALL DAY for an oil change if you drop off (or based on reviews if you stay for it as well). We have dropped off at opening many times in the past, to not receive a call until closing for pick up.

Secondly, the customer service has generally been mediocre at best. However, today while attempting to schedule an oil change online the system kept getting weird. So I called and spoke with someone and was told they had no availability tomorrow, in fact would be booked until next week, and I could barely get an okay out before I was bombarded with an, "Okay, have a good day." Then the phone was hung up.

I'm not one to normally leave poor reviews, but I was absolutely appalled at how I was treated today over the phone. Unfortunately convenience isn't always key I suppose, and they've just now lost a few customers (we have multiple vehicles).

I recommend retraining for this store because it severely lacks customer service and urgency needed to actually get the work done in a timely manner.</review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Text>Took my Ford Ranger in to have the clutch changed. Dropped off on Wednesday & rented car. Friday I call for a status & they tell me they are working on it and it will be finished by evening. I go in the following morning after returning car rental. They never even did an initial evaluation; costing me 3 days of rental for nothing. Telling me what they thought I wanted to hear, and NOT keeping it real. Their mechanic pulled a shoulder tendon. They said he could start working on it in a week. A shoulder tendon requires 6 weeks to heal. Again just telling me what they think I want to hear, and NOT providing reliable information nor service.

Employees here are very kind and approachable. The store is clean and you can find most of the stuff you are looking for. If you are just browsing, check the clearance section at the right of the store to the middle of the isle. What I did find strange is that the store door is not facing Folsom boulevard.<//text>

I went in at noon on a busy Saturday to replace a brake light. I purchased the bulb and asked if they could install it for me. They were very accomidating and I had only a 15 minute wait. They did not charge me for replacing it. I would recommend Pep Boys for your car needs.< /review>

Don't go to this store.  I called on Monday for 4 tires and an alignment and was told that they couldn't do an appt till Thur.  Now I live an hour away but on Wed I had to be in the area anyway so I drop by and they say they have the tires and can do it right now.  I didn't bring the big vehicle to save gas on this trip so I can't.  I set the appt up for 4 pm Thur as we have to be down in the area anyway.  I get a prepaid gift card for the exact amount so they know I'm serious.  At 4 pm we're told that they don't have the tires and can have them at 11 am Friday.  Now they had the tires the day before, they know I need them at 4 pm but they aren't there and they didn't bother to call for extra tires or call me to tell me till we get there.  As bad as this utter incompetence is, what was as bad was the person we talked to who said he was the assistant manager but was as dumb as a bag of rocks.  His answer to almost everything was "I don't know" and "i can't".  He can't walk over and even talk to another employee.  So good bye pep boys.< /text>

I know it is partially my fault for rolling in at 45min till close. But all I needed was a shop with tools and possibly belts to either tighten or replace a bad belt. It was squeeking and the fan was slipping so the engine wasn't staying cool. I wasn't sure if I could make it home, hence why I stopped there.
Nobody else there, everyone was outside smoking.
I explained my simple belt explanation.
The person explained that the "belt guy" wouldn't be in till two days later.
If there was an auto shop equivalent to "the ice cream machine is broken", that had to be it.
So instead of relying on the only shop open after 7, I went to AutoZone, bought the tools n belt, did it myself there in the parking lot. I became the belt guy in about 20 minutes, and made it home.
If the shop is as half assed at everything else, I'd not trust them with much more than a bicycle.< /text>

I took my car in here to get an alignment and new tires. Within a couple of months my car fell out of alignment and I never hit anything or got into an accident and my tires were 75% worn out on the edges and I went back in there and they tried to charge me for the new tires and alignment until I threw an absolute fit because none of this would have happened if they would have done the job right in the first place. Then I get a nail in my tire and they try to charge me 20 dollars to get it fixed and a wait time of 2 hours for a 5 minute job. Any other tire place would fix the flat no questions asked if you bought the tires from them. This company is a joke, way over priced, and a scam. Take your money elsewhere or be prepared for multiple headaches along the way.< /Text>

< Review>
I needed new tires for my F150 and since this is my third purchase for tires for my carsand trucks, i of course went back to the Rancho store. I called late last Monday to check on the tires i wanted and to setup an appointment. I work, so needed the work done on a Saturday. The lady i spoke with said that they could not get the Cooper A/T's i wanted in my trucks stock size. So we worked together and came up with a size bigger. She was really friendly and helpful and said the tires will be ordered and ready for me. She also let me know that the Saturday i wanted would be crazy busy. So i asked, since i was taking that Wednesday of for other appointments, do you have an openings on Wed? She replied yes, If you can leave it here for most of the day and come in first thing. Of course i said yes. When i arrived, i was greeted by the BEST Service Manager - Ken Creitz, who has gone above and beyond for me in the past. We caught up on old times, Yes people he remembered me, and he told me that the tires i wanted were not a good fit for my truck. I was thinking great, now what do i do. Ken explained that this other style of Cooper A/T's, would last longer and would work perfectly for my truck and that he had a set in stock. After his honest opinion, i said lets do it and said i can leave it hear all day if need be. Being the rockstar Ken is, he said, i will get you in first thing and an hour + later, i was driving away in the best looking Cooper A/T's that will last longer than the 50,000 mile warranty, because they are Cooper's people, and i am also getting an extra 1.8mpg. This is all because of the honest and hard work of the team that is the Rancho Pepboys. This is a must service center to go to because of people like Ken and my man Tam, who took care of my truck, did a fast professional job and both went above and beyond any level of customer service out there. I will be back. Thanks!</Review>

<Review>Terrible customer service. Waited in the waiting room ten minutes while 4 of them chit chatted. And I walked out without a single person even looking away from their circle. Went to jiffy lube and was taken from where I left my car to the customer waiting room and spoke promptly with a customer service rep<//Review>< username>

<Review>So I tried scheduling a same day oil change but the phones were busy for over an hour. I then decided to schedule the appointment for an oil change  online. My appointment was for 10 A.M. My husband dropped the car off and he was told that it would be ready by 12 P.M. that day. Their phone lines were messed up so that's why there was a busy signal when I called. 2 hours for an oil changed seemed a bit long, but they looked busy. I was told I'd get a call when the car was ready for pickup. Well 3 P.M. came around I called again and remembered their phone wasn't working, so I decided to walk there being that it is just around the corner from my home. Well I got there and my car hadn't moved from it's original parking spot. I asked the attendant if my car was ready? He said that they hadn't got to it YET! Then he gave me the excuse that one of their tech's had called in sick!  Okay what does that have to do with my oil change? My mother in law who works in an auto shop says that excuse basically means they forgot about my car! There were  3 techs that I saw, and two of the them where just sitting around when I walked by the bays! So he told me that they'd put a tech on it immediately and that my husband requested them to check my transmission fluid as well, so it would take another 25-35 min. So I walked back home and 1 hour later received a call saying that my transmission needed a flush and quoted me $128 for that. Then I was also told that my rear window brake light, and rear license plate light were both out. I told them that I just want the oil change. Well my husband had a talk with the manager about the HORRIBLE service and was given a 10% discount on the oil change which was $45. When we got home my husband said that both lights were working fine. Wow! Then I got a quote from Roseville Mitsubishi for the transmission flush for $112. So all in all, this place will try to swindle you! Better off going to a dealership.</Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Service technician was rude and not able to serve a disabled customer with patience leaning on a discriminatory attitude. Service was not of expectation as battery purchased was not in good condition appeared used. Location could use more leadership and core values training.< /review>

DO NOT GO HERE THIS PLACE IS A SCAM TRIED TO GET ME OUT OF 600 DOLLARS ! Took my car to get a retinue oil change & they told me it could not be done because my oil pan was striped out and without it a oil change could not be done . So I went back to FIRESTONE where I had my last oil change done and asked them what happened to my oil pan . A worker from firestone called pepboys and asked what exactly was wrong . pepboys told them it was the oil drain plug ... remind y'all the oil pan & oil drain plug are two different things and price . Oil pain $600 w labor and the drain plug 10 bucks . So I called pepboys back and asked why would they tell me and the worker from firestone two different things . They then switched it back while I was on the phone with them and said it was the pan . I just feel like since I'm a women pepboys underestimated me and tried to get over ! I wouldn't even give them a 1 star if I didn't have to ... THIS PLACE SUCKS AND SO DO THE WORKERS . I'll never go back again my $42 bill jumped to $600 within 15 minutes</Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>I was told that Lyft/HERTZ cars are fixed for free to us so lost a full day of work cuz my car was on the back burner so I shouldn't complain cuz I'm not paying for anything.  I dropped my car off at my appt time at 9am and I called at 1:30pm to see if it was ready I was told no it's on the rack and it will be 2 hours. So I waited and called at 5pm and I was told no by a Andrew that don't complain it's not coming out of my pockets and by the time it was ready I didn't have time to pick it up before they closed so I reported this to the HERTZ rep. and she told me she would report it and to let the Mgr. Guss know what happened and he stated that he would talk to him. Where any was informed or not I'm not going back to that location again!!!!!☹😲👎<//text>< pics>

<Text>I called for two brake pad sensors.  The guy on the phone told me,"It says we have 2 of each".  Normally when I ask and I get that response, I ask the person to go physically check the part.  For some reason I decided to trust they had the part there.  The thing is, when a parts person tells you what "It says they have", the means they're too lazy to go check.  So I drive down there to an empty store, slow, with no customers.  I ask the guy and he comes back and says they don't have the parts.  Thanks Pep Boys, for a complete waste of time, lousy/lazy service, and for looking hilariously unprofessional.< /Text><Time>1407797772644</Time>< rating>

Made an appointment, went in 30 minutes early and was told I had to reschedule while other scheduled cars weren't even there. Oil change is less than 20 minutes. Should have made an appointment elsewhere. Waste of time.<//Review>

Stopped to get gas and noticed this hole in the wall, so I decided to stop and get a breakfast burrito with bacon. I was pleasantly surprised, bacon was cooked perfectly and was delicious. I'll be back!< /Review>

<review>The food is decent. A little disappointed that they raised the prices on their meals during the covid crisis. I walked in and mentioned that he asked for more money than the menu had suggested for a meal. I was told the prices are "different right now".
Perhaps update your website to reflect the change?< /review>< rate>

We eat here often, commonly getting take out. Friendly people. Fast service, good food, decent prices.  If you are in a hurry and want a good (big) burrito, try the chicken fajita burrito.  Good stuff and more than a meal in itself, and you can eat it in the road if you are in a time crunch.   Nice!<//Review>

Excellent food and service, great family run restaurant. It's such a good gem that I almost always eat here for lunch while working in the area. If I could give it more stars I certainly would!<//Review>

<Review>Had a California burrito here. The burrito was huge and tasty. I had also gotten the agave tacos for a family member, who didn't finish them, which were delicious as well. All around good Mexican food joint though the price point may or may not be a little high depending on what you order.</Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Best Mexican food in the area, but really the only Mexican food in the area. The food is authentic and decent quality but nothing to rave about. The prices are a bit high but again... The only Mexican food around so it's a convenience fee I suppose. Service is good, staff is very nice.<//text>

<text>This just happened a few minutes ago.  I walked in to buy some tamales.  They are about 18.00 a dozen and there is a sign on the cash register that says so.  I said i will take a dozen.  The young man walks back go get them and says there are only 6.  Ok i will take the 6.  The high school girl behind the counter says that will be 18.00.  I said that can't be right as it is 12 for 18.00 and I am only getting 6. She says it is only 18.00 if you buy 12, as she looks at me and points to the special sign on the counter.  I tried to explain the complicated math involved in figuring out the correct amount only to be glared at and again told it is only a special if I buy 12 of which they do not have.  I told her I will take it up with the owner as they have several restaurant.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

After living in San Diego for six years I have developed a taste for the mom and pop taquerias, however, the Grass Valley area did not have anything close. Until, that is, El Agave came along! This is in my opinion our most authentic typical Mexico style restaurant in the area. If you like it spicy try the Diabla sauce it's a sweet and spicy delicacy.<//text>

<pics>None< /pics><Text>Mexican food in a limited food option area. One star for the location, so if you don't want fried chicken or Starbucks, you have options. One star for the menu, which is pretty 'taqueria' typical. $8 and change for a breakfast burrito the size of my forearm earns a third star. The staff is there and does their job and they do not have events, entertainment or much else besides the decor and typical Mexican tunes coming out of the speakers. An outside dining area is also available if you grabbed a coffee next door and have a few minutes to waste. All in all, I go here often and recommend it. The place is about food, not thrills or 'the experience'.<//Text><Rating>4< /Rating>< GmapID>

Really good, traditional Mexican food.  The burritos are huge so plan on half now, half later.  The chilli riennos are very good as well.  Go and enjoy.< /Text>

This is the only Taqueria we have found that compares to our Taqueria in Santa Rosa.  When I told my son about it we had to try it out.<//review>

<Text>The service is not great. The waitresses are very young and inexperienced. I was not greeted when I approached the register and sat there awkwardly for about ten minutes, waiting for service. During this time, three of the wait staff wandered around past me several times without acknowledging that I had walked in... Their nachos are good, though.</Text>< rating>

<Text>So coming from work and about 10minutes away from the restaurant, I decided to call my order in ahead of time. After 45 seconds of dial tone, someone picks up and asks me to hold. I replied okay and he set the phone done but not on hold (I could hear everything thing in the back ground).

As I'm driving to the restaurant, I hear communication in the back ground, and then a few orders being taken. Patiently waiting for my turn, I hear a few employee talking in the back ground (mistake 1). I finally arrive at the restaurant and park, still on hold, and enter the restaurant. I wait my turn in line, and wait for the cashier to finish. I approached the cashier, which is the man who put me on hold, and he just asks me (here or to go) not making eye contact or remotely caring that I'm trying to have a good conversation. I said "here, I am the guy that's been on hold for about 8:30 minutes."

He corrects me to say it's only been 7:30 minutes... I ask if I could have a carne asada super nacho and he tells me they were out of asada. I then walk out the door with utter loss for words over the incident that had just occurred.

Not only was the cashier very rude and put the phone down while I was on the line to hear all the opportunities that he could have taken my order, he also corrected me on how long I was on hold, and the fact that they were out of what they should be serving.

They lost my buisness and it will be a long time before I think about going back to this restaurant....< /Text>< gmapID>

<text>I can't rate their food because I can't eat what they gave me. But I can rate my experience.

I'm on a low carb diet, so I ordered a bowl w/chicken, cheese, lettuce, and sour cream to go. The guy taking my order offered guac, so I got that too.

Unfortunately, I ended up with a high-carb burrito with a ton of rice & beans and no guac. I didn't notice this until I got home and ended up just giving the burrito to someone who wasn't on a diet. Honestly, I know I should've gone back, but it was a long ride home and a long, tiring day at work.

I'll say that the food looks delicious and give them a benefit of a doubt. My friend enjoyed the tacos they got and I'm sure they'll enjoy the burrito as well. I'll try going back in another time, but I'm hoping to get the right order so I can give a higher rating.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Located in/part of the Hotel it's a little hard to see from the street but its worth finding! Dishes are all really authentic and executed perfectly. A lot a variety and pricing is perfect.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9YUA2Bx4V_uKG6tiqhsXtAt7KUP_4ixYRaW6y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0z4urutQhEUJpCN5J7dG42ao3yaIw3Q_tlCjC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxjOLsyqN3nMRVkIUympt7GqCG0yiqzDljnLmX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlNWFDgUr3yzOnjE4IozYBI6pODOGu95mNOsQL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP74Zg_H53UqYR61JNetErkqIoGB47xuO3siYRU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNnY_FWasu1S5nVsyCah10Jd2q8uN_QerwylBA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4xUifabQ8wI5gcDQJMeegWTYgWnNsGvUD342s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOH1Hx1uH1ZYpCo-hXamoWySsQUsiEA4BOBxB3U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnPXTVMUylEj3BKRUzmqHwE31eePJ-FUYYNz9u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEnKVjEPPNJCABX9_MqLc0kwS3L8mNnlWNGJjL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuvLNiULnRDCoM7iGH5UVprP-uBbMRwBzVqqbf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPb6-r4eVceYdOlatoHx0iMoslv1gyH3ZXM_2cF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPru4an9YDMf2g1XYPpNamJrm6fiIJH44jsOUhT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyCd42tDjAJwg1L2k4LrNngTjTCVmPBOPOQu0U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqf8dVC476n2QqoRDk1_fLmzuLcSh-rr6nTt4P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrVrDt5JJ2O9ZNmHHC0DeEBEYc8cj70AjyFNNC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFI_6iYfA-3MeBh5gHcK44UmX3gUmn6umlVwpG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

Local bar and restaurant. Food is amazing too! I usually come by for a drink with a buddy. They also have live music Thursday nights. Welcoming staff, local joint, can’t beat the prices.< /text>

Can't remember what I had Ordered for my  93 year old MOM and myself.  I know that it WASN'T CHEAP.  Over, $20.00 (without tip, although I ALWAYS TIP).  KOTOHIRA JAPANESE RESTAURANT might be the BETTER VALUE.  PLUS, at Kotohira  they give 20% OFF, right now.  WIN-WIN!!!< /text>

< review>
This little hidden gem is nothing short of fantastic! The staff are all so friendly and accommodating, the venue itself is very welcoming and comfortable - and while it’s not over-the-top fancy, it’s not really supposed to be. It’s very much like home, complete with home style cooking!

The menu isn't a novel, which is good. There’s more time and attention paid to the few but delectable selections. Very straight and to the point, which is rare for restaurants nowadays, what with everyone constantly trying to outdo each other with unnecessary gimmicks.

The prices are very fair - the portions are extremely generous, and the food itself is absolutely delicious. Every dish is just dancing with flavor and memories of home. (I’m a happa, too!) My husband and I like to come here for our occasional date night, and we’re never disappointed.

6/5 stars, Happa is always the go-to for us in every category! (Try the burdock chips - I just might go in today for some, they are AMAZING!!!)< /review>

I love this place to death!! The food is unbelievable, the staff's very professional and knowledgeable about their craft. If you're on a budget and still want to eat and drink out, you have come to the right spot. Great happy hour!! Although the drinks are very cheap anyways. I mean... Where else would you get a Budlight for 3 bucks??!?? I know, right< /Text>

< review>
Right away most of the first impressions are usually more unsure due to the fact that this restaurant is attached to a hotel.  More often then not the food is mediocre at best and very little to excite the tastebuds.  Not with Hapa.  I still find that Hapa has a very distinct flavor to their plates, even if they do closely resemble some other restaurants eats.  I'm a big fan of the Tara miso a.k.a Miso black cod dinner plate.  I was never a big fan of cooked fish until I had this plate.  Now it's something I look forward to getting Everytime I go there......tonight they were sold out!  That was not a problem though the mochiko chicken is super good.  They have a good menu, lots of specials, friendly staff, karaoke, full bar and clean restrooms.  Check them out!<//review>

The food was plain and out of the 8 people in my group we all weren't impressed. The proces were way to high. It was $24 for an overcooked new york steak that looked burnt. It is ver casual and it looks dirty inside. I would be fine with a dirty interior if the food shined. I believe this place is popular with Hawaiians and it is more casual dining flavors than I prefer. I won't be visiting here again.<//Review>

<Text>I've been to a couple of plays here now (Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None and Gods of Carnage) and I love this little theater. Both plays I was skeptical how they would be since this is a little community theater. Yet both times I left thoroughly entertained and wanting to come back again soon. The theater is very small (somewhere between 50-150 seats) which makes it feel like you're right on stage with them and makes the experience very intimate. Both plays I went to had me laughing the entire time. They also held a charity raffle both times for two prizes a wine bottle basket and a pair of tickets to another show. They also have complementary snacks and coffee for before the show and intermission. I highly suggest paying full price on the Lamplighters site to help support the theater but if you feel the price is more than you are willing to spend you can find half priced tickets on the sdartstix website.< /Text><user_name>Eric Brunnett-Lazarte<//user_name><user>116993898586475806028< /user></record>

<username>Jane Gredvig<//username><Review>Very small community theatre with fantastic actors... Unfortunately the 2 plays I saw there were duds (Sunshine Boys and Miss Reardon Drinks a Little--badly written endings that went nowhere), so choose what you see carefully<//Review>< Time>

<Text>Very nice community feel, acting was just amazing.  We watched "Goodnight Mother" after finding a great deal on Groupon.  I liked how they did some fun raffles at the beginning of the production too- giveaways were tickets for future shows, wine, and flower vase.  Very small theater, but had raised auditorium seating, good sound quality, simple stage props, mostly creative chalkboard drawings on the walls, but we did enjoy ourselves as novice theater-goers.  Location is nestled in a small strip mall so keep your eyes peeled! Plus side is that parking was easy :)<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmlRfu6vf2kqWkX2I6acfd77l-oEEVlvqxGvht=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><user_id>102194184675931644173< /user_id>< gmap_id>

<review>This award is LONG overdue!! Went to see The Mousetrap when it first opened - Christopher Wren was simply awesome!! The other actors were also very good. I was trying to get more tickets, but you were sold out. Seats are very comfy - thank you, thank you, thank you.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Tasty cream puffs - the cream custard filling is not too sweet. Wish they made a plain cream filling as opposed to vanilla. One staff member was friendly, the other one (female with ponytail and glasses), not so much. Other than cream puffs they also have a plain cheesecake (not the ny style but is semi-sponge/cotton) and lava cake (fondant?).</review>

Love beard papa. Tried several flavors but always go back to original puff with vanilla filling which is best. About $3.55 each.</Review>

Be warned: THIS LOCATION IS NOT OPEN FOR TAKEOUT, even though the website and updates state that it is.
Save your time and avoid running into the rude employee there. Last week, I visited the store and got cream puffs for takeout. However, when I returned today around 4:30pm (during business hours), I was greeted with the worst customer service. After waiting outside the locked doors for 3-5 minutes, I saw an employee return from the kitchen. I knocked continuously because I thought that like last week, I would be able to get takeout. However, the employee proceeded to ignore me for over 2 minutes. When I asked for clarification on whether or not the store was open for takeout, he just pointed at the sign by the door (the sign did not explicitly state takeout is not available) and yelled at me to order online. Not once during the whole interaction did he pause to come near the door or explain to me fully. Never in my entire life have I met such a rude employee.

This is such a shame because I love Beard Papa's cream puffs, but I will never be visiting or ordering from here ever again.<//Text>

Enjoyed custard cream filled puff pastries while visiting near by tourists spots.
Choose a type of outer shell and a choice of filling. Japanese franchise fast food stop.
Bathroom at the small restaurant (ask for a key to access).
About 3 tables inside and 1 table outside. About $4 per each piece (the basic kind). Great to buy a dozen to bring to a party if you live near by.
My kids always ask to stop here for a couple of cream puffs whenever we are near by SFMOMA or Yerba Buena Garden Center.</Text>

Tasty little pastry treats. Not a large variety but they don't need it. If you're in the financial district I highly recommend you stop and try a couple of these. The custard filling is an excellent pairing with the eclairs. They're filled right as you order them so you know everything's fresh.</text>

< review>
Their Vanilla Cream Puff tasted a bit of flour not that  usual silk creamy taste and the outer crust. My Husband tried the double chocolate flavour cream puff and their signature Fondant au Chocolat. Disappointing to find out that the fondant filling was still hard not flowing out after we cut it.</review>

<userid>106957852016782206659< /userid><Review>Still the best cream puffs!

A lot of places, some high end places, will swear up and down that their cream puffs are filled with 'custard' or a custard like filling, whereas they are actually filled with that nasty other kind.

Here the filling is the good kind. The creamy velvety kind, that, yes, gets uber messy when you try to eat it, but who cares.

This is Beard Papa's location I go to when I simply must have a real cream puff. As opposed to the location around the corner, inside the Westfield Mall, which rubbed me the wrong way.</Review>< date>

My daughter picked the strawberry crusted puff and they filled with vanilla. It was delicious. We're definitely going back to get more puffs.</review>

I will preface this review by saying that I don't have anything against the cream puffs here. What I am against is asking "Do you use the same gloves for money and food?" and getting "Sometimes yes, sometimes no." That is not an answer I wanted to hear. Please go to the other location. It is only .1 miles away.<//text>

Pretty overhyped. It's also a mess to eat. I've had the matcha refrigerated and the chocolate fresh and it's fine at best. I actually may prefer refrigerated because the custard is a bit more manageable to eat.<//Review>

This brand is originally from Japan, and there are same stores in my country too.
The taste of the puffs are so milky and tasty.
This is the best puff store ever< /Review>

Cream fillings are tasty, but the actual puff itself is not that great. Too flaky and dry for a puff.</Text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Response>None< /Response><Date>1364075369973</Date><text>Cream puffs really have not had a good enough exposure in the US but this chain helps bring it to the masses. It is a simple and no nonsense place where you order what you want and you get it. There are some standard flavors but depending on the week there are others available too. I recommend the green tea as the special one to get if it is available to you. Otherwise I like the classic vanilla for a good treat.

The puffs will not last too much more than a day so do not expect to save it too long as you might be tempted to if you have no puffs near you. If you know someone who wants a treat this is a good one.< /text>< user_name>

<review>I was recently in San Francisco and walked past Beard Papas several times.  When I saw cream puffs, I knew I had to stop by and I was glad I did.  Their cream puffs are light and crispy and the filling is delicious.  There are a variety of fillings like hazelnut and vanilla.  Check these guys out!</review>< Pics>

The cream puff shells are nice and crunchy and dusted with powdered sugar. I've tried all the flavors but my favorite is the vanilla. I've tried their other items like coffee, cheesecake, and chocolate cake, but they're only okay. Stick to the cream puffs!</review>

I love Choux pastry, which is what Beard Papa uses to make their treats...multiple takes on Eclairs.  They run about $4 each.  On this visit I discovered their Creme Brulee Puff...Help!!!  I've eaten one every day because I don't live near Beard Papa...I'm just visiting.  Thank goodness I can't get these treats all the time!< /Review>

Cream puffs are my favorite, but I've never had them like this place makes them. The puff is a hybrid of cream puff and pie crust and it makes the puff really flaky on the outside. Their pastry creams are also delicious. I love the chocolate because it's not overly sweet and overpowering.</text>

< Review>
This business opens at 9 am,  I got here at abt 1000 and the door was locked but people inside. I tried to ask one of the employees when they opened the front door and went to close it again if they were opening soon or a long wait and the people inside. He didn't answer but closed and locked the door. So rude especially when they are suppose to have been open for an hour.</Review>

I love Beard Papa's but the first time I had it was in Tokyo where they only make a few at a time so they're warm and fresh. This was an alright substitute.<//text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>Delightfully satisfying confectionery, although excessively over indulgent if "you" can't help yourself, unless your better half is with you to moderate your gluttony.
On their own, they are on a par above my mother's homemade creampuffs, when she was still alive ~ if my memory still serves true. But mom made them with an islanders Hawaiian style typical of Oahu.
If you're in the neighborhood of a Beard Papa, come by and get some, I highly recommend consumption with a frosty thick milkshake, or a pint or two of your favorite ice cream - half thawed, for a warm spring/summer's day of indulgence. You can worry about the calories later, because life is too precious to miss out on this treat.
**aaiieee google maps mixed up location with Golden Gate Park for some of these pics.
Wouldn't it be lulzy, to have an Otaku Sweets Cafe Espresso shop with cute girls in maid costumes?</review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Kind of disappointed. Very few options left by the end of the day and there was not enough staff there so service was slow. The filling was yummy but the crust was kind of hard which is not what I was expecting out of a typical cream puff.< /Review>

<Review>This store is clean and the owner and employees are friendly. They sell a wide variety of convince store items.  Unfortunately they do not sell hot foods.  The prices on some items for example One pound package of hamburger is $8.99.  Most other items are compatible to other stores of there type<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Love this place! ♡♡ The owners are really friendly and nice, and usually real willing to help you out with whatever you might need. True, they are a little bit on the pricy side for a few things they sell, but these days,  who isn't really?< /review>

I live down the way and buy my beer and donuts as much as I can. They're as about as courteous as can be for not being from this country. You gotta understand they come here and abide by laws to keep their livelyhood afloat. Been going there more then twenty years. Scumbags like to steal things though. Makes a brother on edge wouldn't you think? Thieves. Usually just have to watch theirselves being stolen from. What a disgrace< /text>

Rude!... Horrible service. Our car broke down, so we stopped here and called a tow truck. Went inside for food and drink and couldn't even use the restroom. We'll never go back.</Text>

<Name>brianna moger< /Name><time>1621086010164</time><rating>1</rating><review>For three years in a row they have messed up every picture order for fall and spring; either the pictures themselves (twice in one year they give me a photo with my daughters eyes closed first, and then on the retake she was mid-word when they told her to say something like unicorn; like you’re a photographer but somehow didn’t catch that in editing?) or the order is wrong/missing. This year they just completely didn’t give me my youngest daughters pictures even though they definitely took my money for them. It would be nice that at some point before my daughters finish school to get a picture order right, the first time. It gets old having to go back and forth with them twice a year, for fall and spring pictures. It’s not only the time I have to spend on it via phone, but in some cases it’s also scheduling *sometimes multiple* retakes. Going forward I wish schools would reconsider using this company. Or I just may have to skip having school pictures as a parent which is just sad. Hopefully I can get my pictures for my one daughter for this year, and then I won’t be giving them my business again.<//review>< Pictures>

Where do I start. Bad quality prints where you can see horizontal lines from the cheap inkjet printer they use. My son's face is tilted up even though when taking the pictures he felt awkward and told the photographer he did not want to tilt his head upwards. His picture isn't even centered. When I framed it he is off center and can't see half of his shoulder. The other side where his shoulder is seen has backdrop showing. Good luck trying to get a hold of them too. It's amateur hour at this company. They're called studio 1? They can't even come up with a better name because they probably just change the number when getting so many complaints. Schools are cheaping out. I think all positive reviews are paid for. Even the posts with pics that ppl upload are terrible. Not focused and show a lot of background for no reason. Poor photographer and poor quality prints. I feel mislead and deceived. I want my money back!</text>

During senior pictures they are a little crazy because of the sheer volume and we haven't been pleased with the outcome enough to spend the $200 plus they charge for senior packages.

The wait was too long and the package deal can be better! The  price is moderate $$$.  Especially in a time like this where unemployment rates are up in this pandemic, it should have been less costly. However if you are going to charge so much, then give a bit more prints and poses per package.</Text>

<Review>Ordered the USB drive with my daughters pictures on September 16th. I got a e-mail October 1st that they were on their way. It is now October 22nd and no delivery. Contacted them and they don't know what happened. "Out of courtesy to me, they would be willing to make another for me and give me option to pick it up. I asked, why was this option not given to us in the website?
Answer, we are doing it out of courtesy to you to ensure you receive it.
First of all, it is not my job to ensure I receive what I paid for including shipping.
I don't know who has possession of my daughter's pictures!!!! That's what has me very upset.<//Review>< Resp>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>Terrible company. For whatever reason my daughters school changed from Lifetouch to this company. The photographers do not know how to pose children. Always a basic hands to your side stance. Well this time they told my daughter to tilt her head down because her glasses created a glare. Seriously you’re a photography company who doesn’t know how to fix that?! Have her take her glasses off. Make shift her head to the left or right a bit. But no. Now we have some awkward looking photo because her head is tilted downward. You have to prepay for the photos so I’m stuck with these now. I’ll never purchase school pictures again as long as they’re coming from this company.< /Review>< Pictures>

Im giving one star because we had a positive experience when getting my son's senior pictures taken but when I received the pictures I was shocked at the quality. I paid alot of money for these pictures and they were printed on floppy low quality Kodak paper. I suggest you buy 1 8x10 picture and go get copies made. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE PICTURES! You will be disappointed.<//review>

Horrible quality pictures.  From their reviews this is nothing new.  I am not sure why the schools keep going with them.  I am sure whoever is on the PTO/PTA board gets kickbacks from them for signing with them.  Lifetouch is way better.  I emailed them about being unsatisfied with the quality of my pictures and no response.  It's been over 1 1/2 weeks.  I guess they do not care that they have bad reviews.  They should invest in better camera.</review>

<review>Over priced for start and took them 5 weeks to get me my pictures with a simple necklace. Ordered December 20th and after multiple calls and follow ups they could not tell me where my package was. I had to make a trip to local post office to make sure they weren't holding it. As soon as i asked for a refund for my purchase of 100+$ they had it ready within a day January27th. Makes me wonder if they even shipped my pictures and dont care about customers orders.

One thing i will say was they weren't rude everytime i bugged them about my order. But definitely lack of communication within. Get it together!</review>< pictures>

I pre-paid for my daughter's school photos. They snapped one quick photo of her with her eyes barely opened. I called numerous times and left voicemail and never got a call back.< /text>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>They charge a sitting fee for over priced senior portraits that most aren’t able to afford but if you want your child to be in the yearbook for there senior year you have to pay for it. It’s not like they weren’t on campus to take pictures for picture day they used for the rest of the yearbook they could have very well used those pictures..no they leave so many seniors pictures missing..disappointing!! way to go...great job!

First I ordered picture for my son from his school. I ordered locket it looks very cheap. And I didn’t liked the picture as well. So I called the them and mailed the picture and necklace back. They said they’re going to send me back a check after few days. Week later I called them to say I haven’t received the check . They said they already mailed it and it will be delivered. Week later again I called they said they issued another check because I haven’t received the check. Another week I waited then called them again they said it should be delivered in a few days. Waited and called them again. They said sorry and they will send a check thru fedex today . Hopefully it’s true this time . In short they’re liar 🤥. Shouldn’t be trusted .<//text>

NOT PROFESSIONAL QUALITY IMAGES. BELOW AVERAGE, and cell phones yield far better images. It is all about whether the photographer understands their settings. I never thought I would say that Lifetouch takes wonderful school pictures, until my daughter's school switched to Studio 1 last year.  The images are consistently bad quality, not even remotely professional.  Last year, besides having an unpleasantly bright face from what appears to be on-camera flash, the camera lens' focus was on my daughter's shirt, so her eyes were a bit blurry.  We had her retake, and the retake was not great, but better than blurred eyes.  This year, the flash on her face was even brighter, and when retakes were done, her face was even more unusually and unpleasantly brighter than the last image (and her hair wasn't looked into by the photographer).  Any company offering professional photography services should know that a  simple inexpensive diffuser is needed to make the flash emit more natural and appealing results, instead of an unusually bright face.  Or a proper lighting set-up would do the job.  Studio 1 apparently is just a business that takes pictures, but is not knowledgeable of the fundamentals of photography and lighting.  Very disappointed.  I was looking forward to her school pictures, but it's such a waste of money that I would rather take my own pictures of her.< /text>

< Review>
I had to take my child in for her High School Senior Pictures. I've been to this location twice. The 1st time was to have the pictures taken. On this particular day, it was a mess back in the back where the pictures were being taken. Three wait time went way beyond what out should had & my daughter really didn't get a chance to do the whole photo session. There were only 2 photographers when we went in & a whole bunch of kids waiting to get their picture's taken. By the time it was my daughter's turn we had been passed the estimated time of wait they had given us & my daughter was ready to go! The 2nd time I went in to pick select my photos for purchase. I had arrived way beyond my appointment time & still wait ed for a long time before being taken to pick out the pictures I was going to pick & payoff our $440+ photo package. This is the company our children's school district hired to fulfill this task. I wish they'd offered options instead.</Review>

I did not receive what I ordered with my children's school picture package.
I was told I was going to receive 1 8x10 and 16 wallets of both my children, which is what I paid for.
When my children brought home their pictures all that was given to them was 16 wallets no 8 x 10.
I called their office and the lady stated that I did not order and 8 x 10 of just my child but an 8 x 10 of the class photo.
I stated to her so I paid all this $ for 16 wallets and a class photo . I told her next year I would just pass on picture orders and she stated to me they would still give each child an 8 x 10 class photo as a "gift" from studio 1.
I told her that doesn't make sense if all the children receive the class photo as a "gift" why did I have to pay for mine since apparently what she told me i paid for was an 8 x 10 and 16 wallets..
She said she would send both my kids 8 x 10 pictures to the school.
I will see if that happens. If it does I will update my review accordingly.< /text>< pictures>

This company were so lazy to fix my sons bowtie before taking the picture, mind you, my son wore a big red bowtie. Shame on them! Such an obvious mistake they failed to fix. Not professional. Never will I buy from them. Prices are definitely overpriced. If you can't take the stress and pace of taking pictures of students for school, then don't! This will only post if I click on atleast 1 star, but they don't deserve any at all!<//Review>

VERY LAZY looking work on helping a child polish up really quick and on the pictures, also. My kids attend San Jose Charter and I really wish the school would wisen up and find a studio that will actually take pride and practice what they preach in what they do. Don't bother wasting your time and money on this company.</Review>

Our school uses this place for some reason instead of Life touch, I've never had good quality pictures from them. This year was the worst. She is red in the pictures, the editing was horrible.. One of her arms is significantly smaller than the other and the position they had her sitting was really awkward and made her collar bones stick out and look like she hadn't eaten in weeks, my child isn't even skinny!!. Perfect picture for a "feed the starving children" advertisement. When I called I got a rude receptionist, no apology for a wasted $50.</review>

Wow!! after reading the comments of the Studio 1 I will no longer pay for photos at my children's school . I pay every year for photos however this year was not up to my expectations my children my son was too dark and my daughter looked like she was completely caught off guard.. and her last name was spelled wrong I was going to call and complain however I see it will be waste of my time after reading these reviews . I just will save my money and take my business else where.

Disappointed Mom who wasted her hard earned money!< /text>

<Text>2 years in a row where my sons school pictures turned out horrible.  Again, they are blurry and his eyes are half shut.  Aweful.  I usually don’t write reviews but I’m so upset with the way these pictures turned out for the 2nd year in a row, I felt others should know.  There are so many other wonderful photographers for the same price.  Chaparral Elementary in Claremont, you can definitely find a better company especially for the price we pay!<//Text>< user_id>

The packet prices were affordable, the staff was polite, prompt and professional and Greg Kelm was amazing in turning around the pictures so that our students would have them in time before leaving for the summer.

<rate>3< /rate><Review>I received my one of my two sons' photo packages, had to call to ask for my other son's package.  The Receptionist took down his name and my home address and said the photos will be mailed and received by me within 5-7 business days.  I am giving them 3 stars because at least they say they are going to send me the photos.  I will wait and see how it goes.  To be honest, my other son's photos were a bit out of focus.  Not so sure I like the quality. Update: the company did a great job of replacing the missing photos, which sadly was not the company's fault, but the school's misplacement.  Now I have two sets.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

I called and complained and they sent me the same pic!!!😡 My other daughters pic they photoshopped a Silver tooth where she has a missing tooth.

<text>Waited for my daughters school pictures for a few weeks. I finally get them there was somebody else's kid with my daughters name. I called studio 1 and they said they lost her images. I tried to schedule a shoot they said they are booked solid for a few weeks. She graduates on June 2nd and she will have no pics with  her diploma . These are once in a lifetime memories and they seem to be bothered I keep calling to resolve this .</text>< Pictures>

<Review>First, they show up to my daughter's high school (Etiwanda), and don't give her a picture form to send home even though they took her picture. So we wait, and no pictures. So I call, and they claim the pictures have yet to be sent to the school. So I drive over to Rancho Cucamonga to their building. The first person says they can't do anything, and then the other person says they can because her picture was taken. I pay in person, get a receipt, and am told the pictures will arrive with all of the kids' pictures at her high school on September 20. No kids receive their pictures on September 20. So I call this morning to hear a recording for 5 minutes telling me I'm the first person in line, and after I finally get someone on the phone am told all of the kids got their pictures yesterday. They didn't. So she finally agrees to send "duplicates" asking if I have a receipt, which I kept. This time I request sending to my home, and after I ask her to recite the address, she gives me the wrong zip code. I ask for a tracking number, and she can't do that, unless I pay another $8? She tells me it will be another 7 to 10 days? To send it from Rancho Cucamonga to Fontana? She was rude also. This is the absolute worst photo place there is in the inland empire, and doesn't deserve to be in business. Inept, incompetent, rude. If my pictures do not arrive, I will have the charge reversed on my credit card, and go somewhere else for school pictures.</Review>< Rate>

<Review>It's really unfortunate they use them for school pictures!  There not same quality as any other school pictures I've ever gotten. Very expensive only offer packages, instead of getting the sizes you actually want ! And just like some one else mentioned they were very rude. Escondido school district please get new company to take pictures!!!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Tried calling twice now. I was caller 3 for 15 minutes, waiting to speak to someone. Then I was booted to the voicemail. Pictures are overpriced and packages don’t make sense! How many class pictures does one family need?< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I do not like x that everything is very expensive only in the head of them can fit that charge $ 45 per photo and 5 × 7 I do not like nothing is too much that amount. Do not be fooled, we can take the picture in the graduation and reveal it in that size and they are the same as a barbarity for me it is not fair

(Original)
No me gusto x que  todo es muy caro  solo en la cabeza de ellos puede caber que cobran 45 dolares x cada foto  y de 5×7 no me gusto para nada es demaciado esa cantifad. No se dejen engañar  nosotros podemos tomar la foto en la graduacion y revelrla en ese tamaño y son iguales que barbaridad para mi no es justo</text>

<Review>A great restaurant that my friend chose. Near the shopping buzz in Union Square, we ate here before we shopped for the day. I didn't know what to expect but once the workers saw my friend and I standing outside waiting for the store to open, they opened the door so we didn't have to wait in the cold. We were pleased at their generosity!<//Review>< pictures>

The food was very good, yet VERY expensive, but the restaurant is in Encino so think of the clientele. The food was delicious and the sides to share are very large, perfect for a family meal. We ordered the creamed corn, cream spinich, mashed potatoes, and mushrooms as side and they all were great. The banana sugar cake was AMAZING. Delicious food all around.</review>< pictures>

I adore this restaurant! They prepare first-rate dishes, they have a nice menu, The cook in that place is a real pro, I like very much eating all their dishes. The dishes are always of high class, the attitude towards the customers  is nice. I visit often this restaurant and I was never disappointed.  I highly recommend it.</review>

Went on aug 4th and it was a 5 star service.  Food was great and service was excellent.  It was so good that I wanted to take my wife back for our 13 year anniversary so we booked it again for 8/16/20 and told reservation we are coming in for our anniversary.  When we went there they welcomed us and wished us happy anniversary.  Everything again was going perfect food was excellent and service was great but why I'm giving them 2 star it was my anniversary I even ordered dessert but they didn't even write anything for our anniversary when most of the place when u let them know in advance they write or do something special.  My wife was little sad.  Our waitress was extremely nice but she didn't even wish us once and I'm really surprised about that.  I don't think she was notified of the occasion otherwise at least she would of wished us once.  Very disappointed</review>

This restaurant is my favored. I go to a lot of restaurants but to this one I go the most. The crew is very amicable and the cuisine they place on your table is so flavorful. I would always prefer to have a decent dinner in this place. I recommend this place with pleasure.</Review>

<Text>I loved my dining experience. I made a reservation and was seated early. The staff was awesome. And the manager Joe checked on us several times to ensure we were being well taken care of.

Nice to have a chance to thank everyone at Larsen's Steakhouse for our wonderful Thanksgiving dinner.  The incredibly gracious staff served us a perfect meal (on hot plates).  All of us appreciated the obvious time and energy that went into making things work so well.  Not an easy thing to do on a holiday with a restaurant full of high expectations.  Loved every minute there.</review>

Great food and perfect service.  Ordered way too much food but loved it all.  Helpful managers and waitress helped select the perfect wine.  Little older crowd threw me off, didn’t have valet parking.  Would say it’s perfect for everyday steak night but a little lacking for special occasions.  Will be going back for sure.< /Text>

The Service: Sitting at the bar. The bartender is very friendly and attentive. The service is excellent. They treat customers like VIP.

The Food:

Macaroni & Cheese - They add in sun-dried tomato and bacon bites. Love the texture! Creamy cheese but not too much.</text>

The prices are very high, but the food is amazing. The steak was tender and juicy, the sides were hearty and flavorful, and even the bread was specially made, warm and fresh and with cheese. I highly recommend this place if you've got a lot of money to spend.<//text>

<Review>Parking was easy. (Always a plus esp in LA). The ambiance was nice, cozy, romantic and enjoyable. They have a piano player, who played a few old time favorites. We got seated right away. Our  waiter Jamie gave us Grade A service. Why I chose to give it the 5 stars. The service was superb. The food was delicious overall. I had the Ahi Tuna tartare and Heirloom salad, which were both on point. The shared favorite was the Macaroni and Cheese with sundried tomatoes and bacon. Oh how delectable that was. Relished it. We also shared the creme brulee, which was a little underwhelming. The berries fresh, the cream fresh, just was expecting a little more creme and a little more burnt sugary crust. I would definitely come back for the service and to try the steak.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

I like the environment of this place. Very unique and old school. However, had a bad experience.

First off, the server was kind of rude. When we sat down, we immediately noticed how dirty their little plates were. We brushed it off like whatever bc we weren't planning to use it anw. Then we got our bread w/ little bowl full of butter. One thing that I found unique was that their condiments were displayed by the walls. It was a bit hard to grab some since ppl were besides it.<//text>

The service is not bad, but the prices are outrageous and not justified. The food is average, nothing special. The special which costs $125 was advertised as 16oz of prime meat. It barely contained 11oz of thin sliced regular beef covered in gravy. I was not impressed.< /Review>

<Rate>4</Rate><text>I'd give Larsen's 5 stars but there have been a few times where we haven't really loved the food, so until I find it more consistent I have to give it 4.  That said, it's one of the best steak houses in the valley.  We love the Lobster Bisque.  The last time I went I had a cajun steak special that was by far the best steak I've ever had there.  Unfortunately, the rib eyes have been hit or miss.  Many times there isn't enough seasoning.  But, when we have a special occasion or just want a nice night out - we typically choose Larsen's.</text>< Pics>

<Text>The pitch is 'High-class Steakhouse', but the delivery is slightly less.
The restaurant is located in a two story mini-mall in Encino. Parking is underneath & will cost you $5 to self-park. The room itself is small in comparison to typical steakhouses and lacks the leather booths you get at Musso, Ruth's Chris or practically all others. I was there a little after 6 on a Friday and it was packed already. I ordered the dry aged New York strip and, at $65, it wasn't as infused and flavorful as you'd expect, but it did have the nutty nuance dry ageing produces. It's not a rip-off, but expensive for the overall product. I asked for bread twice and never got it. Sides were tasty and generous.
Overall, the service is ok and the quality is good, but at $100 for a steak, two half sides and one drink, the price point is too high. Better steaks with better service are available elsewhere.< /Text>< name>

Another one of my favorite lunch spots...so, some tips for first timers who have never tried Larsen's Steakhouse on Ventura Blvd.

Starting with the steaks ... if you love steak, you have to get the 16 oz Marinated Rib Eye.

If you're not a beef fan or simply want to avoid red meat, the Salmon is my favorite alternative.

And for those times when your appetite demands a hearty sandwich, then go with the Prime Rib French Dip.

In fact, everything I've tried from their menu has been delicious.  So, go to Larsen's. Eat up. It's terrific.<//Review>

<Text>The food was amazing, the service.... Woefully lacking for the pricess your paying. A table full of empty wine glasses with a full bottle of wine sitting on the table and a portion of the meal brought out 20 mins after the rest of the table has been served is unacceptable...shame on you. They did compensate on the bill, though then handed us another tables left overs. Accidents are understandable. One foul up after the other is simply a sign of incompetence.<//Text>< time>

Larsen's has been a mixed bag for me, mainly because one time I had their prime steak and it turned out to be almost cheesy-consistency due to the way they buy and store it -- in a plastic vacuum sealed bag.  Apparently, if there is any breach of that bag, it can go bad.  In any case, that was one incident, and I've been back there since and have loved it.  Good wine list as well.</text>

<Review>I ordered steak tartar for my entree. Waitress asked me how I wanted it cooked.. and I said, tartar is raw.. She explained that sometimes the customers wanted it cooked.. so I shrugged ok.. no i would like it raw. She placed an order for beef sashimi instead of the tartar I ordered. When I informed her it was incorrect, she went back to the kitchen. Everyone at my table was already finished with their giants steaks before I received my RAW tartar almost 20 mins later. It was terrible.. as if they took the meat from the grinder, heavily added onions and plated. Terrible.<//Review><gmapID>0x80c28740a6f2e19f:0x81d19e1be015d4f8</gmapID></record>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Response>None</Response><text>There were no cars behind me but the person taking my order was a bit rude and rushed me through the drive through without repeating my order to me and so naturally they got some of it wrong. My burger was COLD cold and they barely put any of the cheese sauce in it that makes the whole burger... It was gross. The sodas were probably 60% ice... The only good thing was that the chili was adequately filled although the toppings were wrong. I was too tired to tell them anything tho, so i just ate what I could and hit the road to go home.</text><name>Jess Jess<//name><date>1623023287004<//date>< GmapID>

Got a pretzel burger, was generally impressed. Pretty  standard Wendy's stuff. The soda fountain was kinda awkwardly placed because they're only letting you use the gas stations one, but the soda tastes fine.
(I have no idea how closing the fountains keeps people safe from covid, an airborne disease, but that's probably the health Departures flexing its muscles)<//Text>

<Review>I stopped off to get gas at this pilot gas station at the corner of I-5 and Highway 46.
I went inside and saw that they have a very nice mini market here. Also attached is a Wendy’s hamburgers. I ordered a single cheeseburger combination which came with fries and a Coke. The burger was very good it was fresh and it was hot.</Review>< GmapID>

Friendly but tired looking staff. Food was good, but since when does a meal cost over $13?! I like Wendy's but I can get real food for the same price range.<//review>

Literally the best Wendy's I had in a long time which says something for being on the side of the highway... Though i was pretty hungry so anything probably could have tasted good. None of the Wendy's at home taste this good. Yo truckers and people of all sorts, get yo burgers here.<//Review>

I couldn’t do 0 stars we drove thru the drive thru ordered two kids meal one plain burger with only cheese 2nd one cheese burger plain with only mayo we emphasized the plain part on both orders yet our order was wrong both burgers had massive amounts of Mayo and ketchup i went inside to exchange them 1st of all the employees just stare and don’t even ask what they can help you with I told the cashier both my burgers were wrong she looked at me like I was talking a foreign language and walked away I’m assuming she called the manager she asked for my receipt which was never given to me in the 1st place at the drive thru the manager walked away to look for my receipt I told her I had just drove off from the drive thru she kept responding with an attitude she asked what I wanted on the burger so I repeated myself again she walked away halfway stomping she handed me the burgers I should have checked them there
but I didn’t and walked to the car and yet again one of my burgers was wrong so again I went to ask if they could change it the manager had full on attitude by now I told her it wasn’t my fault if I specifically said what I wanted she said I needed to be more specific this is the way we order everywhere we go it’s not that complicated she was mumbling so I asked her for her name and I’m definitely calling corporate tomorrow morning I always approach nicely but 3tries and still can’t get it right won’t be coming back here</Text>

< Review>
We stopped in at 1 a.m. on Thursday/Friday morning. They're actually surprised to see they were open. They're inside a gas station, or a truck stop whatever it is.

When we walked in there was about 7 or 8 people in front of us waiting for their orders. Apparently it's a pretty hoppin place. All the chairs were on the tables though so we were not able to sit in the dining room.

They were out of bacon. I find this absurd since 80% of their food has bacon. But it is what it is. There was no offer of a discount missing one of the main ingredients.

I got a chicken Asiago sandwhich, spicey, It was pretty good. Would have been better with bacon. Needed more mayo, but we had left already.

Hubby really wanted the baconator, but obviously couldn't have that. So he got a Jr Bacon cheeseburger deluxe, minus tomato, and a small fry. The fries had no salt, and desperately needed it. The burger was good.

And we got a 50 cent frost, which is always good. This location is definitely lacking. They were busy, and only have one guy at the register, who was also making food, and did not wash up in between.(Yuck) Next time, I think we will keep driving.<//Review>

JANET HATCHET is so refreshing and definitely a KEEPER!!!!

Holiday/peak travel turned every parking lot (and every fast food line) in the area into a zoo, but these guys were on top of it. Quality did not suffer despite the pace.<//Review>

<Text>Very good food. Customer service is great.  The building is clean and is in n a convenient place.  I rate it 4 stars.  Why I'm not putting 5 stars is because the food took a little bit longer than usual which is about 7 minutes.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80eb11cf3d0165cb:0xc151cf958e71790b<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Team members are kind and helpful, made my stay pleasant and welcoming. The food is good and fresh and the environment is clean. There is charging outlets and the convenience of Pilot Travel Center for facilities and other travel concerns.</Text>

The remodel is coming along nicely. The eating area is roomy, the employees are friendly and efficient. Food was fast and the order was accurately filled. Good Wendy's fresh quality.
The attached store has the best assortment of auto and truck repair incidentals that I've seen close to the highway between San Jose and LA.</review>

They're in a busy location and often run out of things.  Today they were out of salads and baked potatoes by 1:00.  The overall building it shares with a Pilot has been recently remodeled and is clean & cool in the summer</Text>

Everything great BUT you have to change the filter on your soda machine.  I ordered a sprite and it tastes like all sorts of things but definitely not like sprite.  Your flow tubes may be molded.</text>

The interviewing of potential employees should not be done within blatant earshot of customers while they are eating.  Especially if you are planning to embarrass and degrade said potential candidates in front of people while they are trying to eat, i felt bad for this guy,  and there's no way in hell i would work here. Sensitivity training is definitely needed here.</Text>

As far as fast food restaurants located inside truck stops are concerned this one is about as good as it gets. I mean the food is clean, they keep the temperature inside really low which is very important on hot summer days in California.<//text>

<review>I feel bad to say that every time I go to any Wendy's I rarely enjoy my meal. And never looks like the picture and I'm always left disappointed. The one thing I could say that I always love is the 99 cent chicken nuggets. But since  I rarely go there I don't even know if they're still 99 cents. This location in particular is a travel location were many people from all over are passing through so it can get really packed. The day I went was a very packed and I waited in line a long time but it was OK and I knew it but the food was just meh.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

They did a great job, and accommodated for us after a game. We came in about 11:30 p.m. and service was a little slow but there were many of us. Burgers were hot, but the fries were terrible at best and the sodas were flat<//Review>

<Text>I always thought all Wendy’s were the same, but this place blew me away! We had a more complex order (I.e three distinct meals, hold pickles and tomato on one, e.t.c) but it came out in less than a minute and was exactly what we ordered. Most impressively, the food actually looked as good as it tasted, which you rarely see at this and similar chains. Many thanks to your remarkable staff, I hope they continue having pride in their excellent service.

I always thought all Wendy’s were the same, but this place blew me away! We had a more complex order (I.e three distinct meals, hold pickles and tomato on one, e.t.c) but it came out in less than a minute and was exactly what we ordered. Most impressively, the food actually looked as good as it tasted, which you rarely see at this and similar chains. Many thanks to your remarkable staff, I hope they continue having pride in their excellent service.

I visited 7:15 PM November 9th, 2017.< /text>

Well first off it's dirty, clean the tables, just wipe them off. Next when I ask for lemonade with a little ice don't fill it up with ice all the way and then add lemonade and give it to me. When I pointed out the issue I was told they would give me a free refill. When I went back for the refill the lady was on break and was not going to be back for 20 minutes. So I got no real and I got screwed on my lemonade. Not happy.< /Text>

<name>Mia Wellington</name><text>The managers are rude, especially one named Emily. The fries are almost never cooked right. They soggy and stale. The place is always a mess. It is one of the worst places to eat in Lost Hills. Plus, it's overpriced. Save your money go to Taco Bell!!!</text>< GmapID>
