<text>One of the best bento boxes around, I always get the chicken. Beef is a little greasier. Tempura vegetables are one of the best, the dipping sauce is just right.< /text></record>

Delicious food and quick with the orders. We got the Bantu bowls and the only thing negative I have to say is the ribs are super fatty/chewy. They’re delicious but some pieces I couldn’t swallow. Definitely recommend regardless of that though.< /Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Two days ago I had the curry chicken bowl...so good...so stinky (in a delicious curry way)...pure heaven. It was almost like a hearty stew. Absolutely loved it! That sealed the deal for me. They won me as a lifetime customer with that one. The chicken teriyaki bento meal was just another reason to come back. I’m currently fighting the urge to come back for the third day in a row 😬 if that tells you how much I love the food here<//Text>< pics>

<text>I have never left a review for anything before but ive felt guilty not leaving a review for this wonderful establishment. Ive been coming to this place since I was a small child twenty years ago and let me tell you it was an absolute banger then and its an absolute banger today. This place Rocks, if you live in visalia and you havnt tried this restaurant I wouldnt waste anymore time because you only live once people. The japanese cuisine they put together is not only the most affordable in town but as well among the highest quality in presentation, flavor and most importantly freshness. Thank you for all that your family has invested into this community, in my eyes you serve as an integral facet to this town I call home. Stay blessed and thank you for blessing us greatly. 😍</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80952f28a84f190b:0xd2ba02611e354598</gmap_id></record>

Nearly DIED, worst food ever!! Got the "special" as recommended by the waitress which was the Seafood pad Thai, waited about 30 minutes for it...so I decided to wait the other 20 minutes in my car. Finally, when it was done she brings it out to me to my car(hungry nonetheless I receive it and go) I get home to only realize that there was only 3 and a half shrimp. Paid around 10.99 plus tax for it. The shrimp were covered in a sauce to disguise the foul smell coming out of them. The shrimp were rotten/expired. The noodles were soaked in a sauce that seemed poured out of a bottle that by the way I tasted and gaged. The taste of the shrimp had penetrated the noodles, but then again maybe it had all been frozen together. Poked at the shrimp with the fork it was rubber, it had been so overcooked it turned into a complete circle. Terrible disturbing experience I am truly disgusted oh and all while being pregnant. NEVER AGAIN!< /text>

Instant stomach ache. Not recommended. My husband and I got the teriyaki beef, gyoza, crunchy roll and super California roll.

The super California was warm when it was brought out, and lacked flavor. The crunchy roll was okay, same with the gyoza.

The beef teriyaki was terrible. It smelled like dog food and the beef could have been grilled a little longer.<//text>

<Review>This place is a little hole in the wall. Most people dont know about it but I would like to change that. The food is awesome and priced very nicely cheaper than fast food but way better. I personal favorite is the chicken cutlet bento box with tempura vegetables and make your california roll crunchy makes it 10 times better. If you like japanese food give it a shot you wont be disappointed.<//Review><time>1548381966855<//time>< user>

The food is great, fresh, fairly priced, and the staff is always nice and helpful and constantly cleaning or maintaining something. This is one of my go-to places in town for consistently great food, quick service, and kind people.</text>

<text>Tonight was our first night here. Actually i am still here. But can't believe we had to wait 50 mintues just to get 1 plate of our 6 plate order! And the waiter was still rude about when we asked where was our order.< /text>< pics>

The place had decent tacos. I tried the carne asada ones. The tacos were decent, but probably won’t return for tacos here. I think their taco meat is a little too thick or bulky for me
La agua de Jamaica was great though!</Text>

Order chicken soup and a 1 taco al pastor (pork). Taco was decent (trust me I know about tacos)  but the chicken soup was not at all. First of all it only had 2 different vegetables, and the worst part that the actual chicken tasted old. Like I'd they had that soup for a while now. And then the lemon hardly had any juice in them. #disappointed< /text>

<time>1618782388072< /time><rating>1</rating><text>They pretty quick on getting your order , it’s okay I guess if that’s Mexican food .  If you order a asada meat burrito and ask for it with no rice, don’t be surprise if you get a real skinny burrito for the same price.
Update (4-18-21) order a pozole that was sorry and no taste and a torta cubana that look more like a sloppy joe burger . As time pass by their  prices keep going up and their food look sorry and taste is even worse .

I’ve wanted to try this place for a long time. Every time I go to the Galleria Mall we pass this place. Today I finally went. I got the hard shell Carne Asada taco and the Chile Verde fries. Both would make Mexico embarrassed. The shell was from a package, quick deep fry and the steak was not seasoned. The Chile Verde was thick like guacamole. I would not return.</Text>

This little place food and beverages are totally authentic this is not a place I would say if you were in the area try to stop and eat there it definitely is a place where I would say make a stop try it out I’m sure you’ll go back time and time again.it is clean and nice. you will quickly make friends with the staff and you get your food just as you ordered it you could watch them make everything yes open kitchen it’s pretty cool the portions are big the bill  is small.

The food was not good. And they charge $1. If you use credit card and for me it was outrageous. I spend over $33. And they still charge me for using my credit card. They also charge you extra for sauces and something I don't know about. They should tell people that there's some hidden charges for everything. They're food is not good anymore. Many years ago yes the food was good but not anymore.</Text>

Family had tacos , torta cubana and chile verde plate. Tacos were ok and torta cubana too but the chile verde plate had some whole pepper. Beans were cold and no flavor as well the rice. I will never return here. Pricey . the food is not worth it.<//Text>

To be honest I didn't like the food it looks like to old & the way the guy cook not good. Plus they charge extra 2 dollars for what I ask, bcuz in the menu my plate cost $13 dollars, so the lady charge me $15 dollars she says bcuz that's the price without further notice. another customer complain bcuz she charge another 3 dollars extra without further notice 2. when the menu have one price & they charge differently that's sucks. So pls check the menu & the price before you order there.< /review>

Food was good 👌. I had a coupon from the entertainment book . When I presented the coupon the clerk said they no longer accept the offer. Since I was already there and hungry I ordered food. needless to say I won't return.</Review>

An odd experience.  No prices on the menu board.  "Say what you like to order, I'll tell you the price".

The carne asada was dried out, and the other food was just not good.  Sorry to say, because I don't like being negative... but it really wasn't good.

I mean... even the rice and beans were flavorless and bland.

Will try them again in a couple years to see if they have improved.<//Review>

It was flavorful: just a great concoction of flavors blended together to make one delicious meal! I had the Chile Relleno w/rice....also very delicious! It was overcast and chilly, this meal warmed us right up. We'll be back for sure!

The last 2 times I have gone the meat had a lot of burnt bits and flavor was just ok. Use to be sooo much better. Hopefully this is just a phase<//review>

< review>
Recently moved to this neighborhood and happened to walk by and thought "this place looks like the type of place that would have good Mexican food", and I was not disappointed. I tried a chicken, carne asada, and al pastor taco. They were all tasty but the al pastor taco was my favorite. You can probably find cheaper Mexican food in other parts of LA, but for the South Bay the prices are a steal. I am sure I will be back too often for my own good. Just be aware they do charge an extra $1 for cards so try to have cash on hand.< /review>

<review>Poor attention to simple detail... I asked for no salsa on the tacos and when i pick up my order I get home i have salsa on the tacos. These tacos were for my 4 year old son obviously he was unable to eat them. So sad that the previous business is no longer there. Will not return... Try another place.< /review>< username>

After landing @ LAX we were looking for some fast local Mexican food. This came up on google. We ordered rolled tacos for the kids & a monster burrito for the wife & I to share. The carne asada was over cooked & the rolled tacos tasted strange, my son wouldn't eat them at all. We are used to San Diego '...berto's' style drive through Mexican. The meal was also over priced & it took 15 minutes to prepare (only ones there.)</Text>

(Translated by Google) Very good Mexican food, after seeing so many negative comments, I hesitate to visit this place but the pozole, the tacos and its fresh waters are very rich, the truth is that I will visit this place with my family again.

<review>(Translated by Google) The food is good but the chips are stale and the sauce is spoiled. It's been several times that it turns out the same. One comment I make is to be careful that things are fresh. Thank you.

La comida está buena pero los chips están rancios y la salsa está hechada a perder. Ya van varias veces que me sale igual. Un comentario que les hago es que tengan cuidado que están frescas los cosas. Gracias.<//review><user_id>108899494332881162848<//user_id><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

<text>(Translated by Google) The food is very good, the place is clean, even if I eat outside, there is no dust on the tables and benches, very comfortable and friendly employees. The place is quiet I like it.

<pictures>None<//pictures><Text>(Translated by Google) A few days ago I was the cashier of the afternoon shift was very rude I asked her for a pozole the dish was dirty from the outside I returned it because it was too salty which I said k was too salty and I was very thick which she reluctantly she said pure waste of time which I would try to be kind and find a solution to the problem since it is not the first time that I am going to eat there but really there are people who should not be able to attend to the public

(Original)

I locked my Keys in the truck. 3 fellas were so accommodating. I ran out of hours and they let me park on property and not on the street. These 3 souls really made the rest of my day. Great night crew you have.......as a woman driver they made me feel safe. Thank you guys!!!!!!<//Review>

Truckers!  There is on street parking places if you want to beat the LA rush traffic.
They also have plenty of space to park on their lot but it does get full some days.
Good people to work with and thet do get you out as fast as can.</Text>

I had a 0700 appt. Arrived at 0630. Got a door at 1130. It is now 1500 and I'm still waiting for my paperwork after paying the lumper an hour ago. This BS has got to stop!</text>

<review>Receiving hours 7am to noon, arrive just before 7 along with 3 other trucks, all docks empty..park along the wall they say and wait in your truck..an hour later none of us have moved. Sitting here because we have nothing else to do?? No respect for drivers' time whatsoever.. and no doubt they will charge us lumper fees to offload their product. Wish we could all just drive away!!<//review></record>

I've lived in the area for 13 years and always used this station, until now. I get it that COVID-19 has some people scared but to refuse me service when I'm the ONLY person in the store just trying to grab two items on my way to work as I do so many other days is just absurd. Country of Riverside removed the face covering restrictions a couple weeks ago. Not to mention that ADA regulations clearly state that you cannot force a customer to wear a face covering or ask them why they choose not to wear one and deny them service. I've been into food businesses that don't even require it for a pickup order. I've been in Lowes along with other similar business and its no longer required. Today will be the last time I give any of my business to this location.< /text>

<Review>I was passing through on the 215 and needed to stop for gas.  The Mobil on Newport Road seemed like a good place to stop since it was fairly close off the exit.  The yellow plastic bags indicating about half the gas pumps were out of service should have been a clue to go elsewhere, but I figured the rest of the pumps should be working.   The first gas pump I tried read my card and seemed like it started to fill so I went inside to use the bathroom.  When I returned the gas pump had filled about 50 cents worth of gas in my car.  The pump was still running, I tried stopping and restarting it to no avail.  I moved on to the next pump.   The second pump I tried also read my credit card, and again it started filling my gas tank up.  It was faster than the first pump I tried, but after about 5 minutes the gas pump had only pumped about 3 gallons of gas in my van.  By this point my kids were getting restless and I gave up out of frustration. Luckily I had enough gas to get home with our stopping again.  What a frustrating experience.  Recommend anyone stop at another gas station.  (Hopefully Exxon/Mobil) will read this.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<review>Man worst cart wash ever.  I use my truck for work so it gets dusty. They didn't wipe interior down at all and only wiped around driver's door area so I didn't notice till I got home.  Was going out of town with family which is why I was there when they opened just to get inside clean.  So I wiped it all down before we loaded up.  Won't be going back<//review>< rate>

This location is a bit hectic because of the car wash and the mexican fast food joint running from the same building. Employees at the counter cracking jokes, talking to each other while you stand in line so i rather not go into the building for a drink or whatever, just pump gas and get out of there. I do like the car wash with actual people detailing your vehicle.<//review>

<Review>Clean station, lube and mexican food all combined in one. Giving it 2 stars for overall organization and false advertisement they have a special for free car wash with oil change but oil change side doesn't mention extra charges for bigger cars which they do as you park on the other side for the car wash. Also instead of just waiting one time (you figure once the oil change is done they drive it to do the wash) nope have to drive your car around the front thru the pumps area then park it on the opposite side then wait. While waiting inside you have the employees bickering very unprofessionally at each other... even the manager treats them like kids.< /Review>< Pictures>

It takes forever to get the car washed.  The car sits in the hot sun for sometimes up to 20 minutes before anyone has began to dry it.  I've waited 1 1/2 hours from wash to driving away.  On weekends they need more help.  There needs to be another car wash in the area.</text>

Went in today at 8:40 a.m to get gas and the girl was   Sarcastic after I asked why the pump was not working. She replied "what did you do walk around the block"  accompanied with a snarky look. I spent one minute to order a burrito and headed out to pump gas. Not a good look Mobil.< /Text>

Half the gas pumps do not except dente cards and you have to walk in to pay for gas. Then a lot of the times I've been there it takes forever to purchase small items because they have customers paying for a carwash and that takes quite some time. Counter help needs improving.</review>

ExxonMobil, good gas but it's always the most expensive for a gallon of gas compared to other stations. Staff is ok.<//Text>

<Review>So I always go here for gas, but I also go to get my oil changed when I'm being lazy and don't want to do it myself, but then I discovered that when you get an oil change you also get a free car wash! So now it's my go to, because driving a car that children eat in....I am in constant need of it being washed!</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I am a current employee here and all i can say is this place is horribly operated management doesnt care about any of the customers ive been here almost 2 years and all ive seen is a noise dive in quality of service and again its all down to poor managment from the carwash to the gas ststion its all ran essentially by the same managment team and they are only present for few hours a week innever heard of a place that micro managed from a location 2 hours away untill i started to work here and if all that doesnt bother you the building is infested with mice and rats i see them everyday ive been reporting it to management for months even gone as far as filling a formal complaint to the riverside county health department they dont care because the customers keep comming back and happily giving this company businesses it does not deserve and thats not even mentioning the gas pumps that break down everyday due to negligence of the poor managment and cheap ownership who refuse to do anything even after beimg told multiple times its time for an uprgrade this establishment is a joke<//review>

Employee were nice, first go in line was told the phone we wanted to trade in was in stock waited 45 minutes after being told we were next and only one person was ahead of us to find out the phone was not in stock and then had to have it shipped and charged for shipping. Understaffed, but clean and nice employees< /Review>

<Text>Very happy, It was my birthday and I need to start building credit & I needed a new phone, so I went down to the Sprint store and Marilyn welcomed me and told me how much everything will be . She was very friendly and helpful & I got new service  with a LG G6 in no time. I live the service I been to Sacramento and back with LTE working. Voice calling is clear and for the price you can't beat Sprint . Marilyn gave me all my info and a paper showing me the bill and charges . With that it's just what she said my next month bill is $98 with the phone, unlimited data, and Free Hulu. Thank you Sprint in Lodi CA & Thank you Marilyn<//Text>< userid>

I was greeted quickly and only waited a short time as there were other people ahead of me.  That was not a problem.  They handled my situation quickly and they were aware I had an appointment.  Great service I would recommend getting an appointment just so they are aware and you are in the right place since the have merged together.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<review>Elizabeth (Liza), one of the store managers spent over two hours with me trying to make a corporate wrong, right. She genuinely cared and saw my issue through to resolution, all while keeping me entertained and happy. Could not have asked for a better experience for a crummy situation (at no fault of her own). Clean store. Adhered to all COVID-19 rules and then some. Highly recommend!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x809aa16ca1caf6e7:0x55fd5a949f88464e<//gmapID></record>

Sale person was great and new store was great too. I didn't like that they had phones that couldn't handle. I am disabled and need to know if phone was to heavy to hold. I bought one hope it not to heavy.<//Text>

All employees were very courteous and extremely helpful.  I had them take care of three separate issues and all 3 were resolved in a short time. They  were very friendly and they were probably the nicest people working  anywhere that I  have been.<//Text>

I wish the rating was just for the repair / service desk here. I would have given 5 stars. The guys that repaired our phone were great. The reps in the store not so much. I wish the service desk had there own register to check out people for the repair charges when there were done fixing the phone, and its ready for pickup. Our phone was ready to go, but we had to stand around, and wait for a rep to ring us out. Which took a little less than 20 minutes before we got help again. Very annoying. Other than that the actual repair went great.< /Text>

Absolutely the best experience I've ever had at any sprint store, ever. Literally. I was instantly greeted by this very gorgeous woman with very beautiful hair. She was a graceful young woman with delicate features. Unfortunately and regrettably I did not get her name. She was very helpful, made me feel real comfortable and didn't hammer me about any products or services. I told her my phone needed the screen replaced due to it having the gps settings burned onto the screen, she walked me over to the technical guy. No appointment? No problem. I gave him my phone and he gave me a two hour waiting period. I was a bit skeptical at first, like two hours really? But I wasn't in a rush as long as my phone got fixed and it  wasn't crowded at all, barely anyone else there. Time flew by and when I got my phone not only did it have a new screen but a new battery as well. How awesome is that! Definitely the go to sprint store and I highly recommend you come to this location. But don't take my word for it, see for yourself. ^.^</Text>

I ask customer service teller for a sim and I ask how do we activate the sim he says go online and do it. I ask him what sections do I activate the sim online and he says I don’t know. I think he was just lazy. Company gets 0 stars for service.</Review>

Just went to this sprint store we have 4 phones that needed looked at all 4 phones did not have a Crack or scratch on them when we dropped them off and was told 2and a half hour wait went back to get them and was told nothing was wrong with them and when we asked how the back of got cracked the girl with the black and purple hair said it was cracked and called my son a liar to his face . This store we were told to go to by a sprint technical support because we would be treated better then any other sprint store would treat us. Yeah right that was a slap in the face!!!</text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>Those are some rude guys working at the asurion counter. I walked up for help & told them my issue. Without even looking at me they said give us a minute. Why not say that before I get to telling you what's wrong? Then he takes one look at tiny corner cracks & even though I said it's been glitchy since I first got this 250 dollar replacement, tells me oh well that was a manufacturer defect. Right, he didnt even check my phone completely. Very UNHELPFUL. I'm convinced that all sprint wants is money, 250 to replace with insurance...50 & 60 bucks for a screen protector & case that doesn't protect. 99 bucks for a damage fee to turn the phone in. I hate sprint. I definitely wont be coming back to this one.< /review>< Pictures>

<rating>1<//rating><text>Sprint has all the requirements to be one of the worst cellphone companies in the U.S.A.

But specifically talking about this store the waiting time to be attended is insanely long as all the sprint stores I been visiting lately
I saw around 6 workers 4 of them just sitting down and probably doing nothing and only 2 of them helping people.

We had to wait more than one hour to be attended just to be told by a technician that they dont have loan phones and that they dont have any obligation with the customer to get them a phone while in repair service, they basically do it for courtesy. Shame on you sprint and all of your horrible technicians
We will have to wait 3 to 5 days to get our phone fixed and back to our hands

Are you kidding me sprint? This is how you want to get more customers in your network? That aint gonna happened, this company needs to learn a lesson

Did I mention that the employees at this place are also very slow 🐌 and like other reviewer said these people scann your ID everytime they need to access your account which in my opinion that is not right

They offer you insurance for your phone but their repair service is among the worst they only have technicians in certain areas, we have to drive 90 minutes to get to this lodi location to get our phone fixed then leave the phone for 3 to 5 days to drive another 90 minutes to go picked it up very very inconvinient!

The deductibles are also insanely high here are some examples:

For fixing a broken screen: $100
For replacing your phone with an used one: $200

Just do the math, the most common problems for a phone owner is a broken glass screen.

in my case is an iphone 7 if I would take it to a certified store to get it fixed it will cost me $170 you would probably say: thats a 70 dollar difference but the thing is that I been paying insurance for more than a year, 14 months to be exact 13 dollars a month so basically I will be paying sprint $282 for getting my screen phone fixed

That is terrible! And thats my story planning to dumped this horrible company in the following months

I almost forget to mention that sprint also has one of the worst unreliable network coverage in this country

Shame on you sprint, you will be losing lots of customers if you dont do changes to your horrendous policies if you agree with me please support this review by giving it a like, thank you!< /text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) The service they have to repair is very good and fast, the staff is very friendly. There is always parking, it looks very clean.

Overall nice community to live in. The grounds are kept up really well. Maintenance is always friendly and helpful. The biggest issue we are currently having is with our dishwasher. It never worked the greatest and it finally stopped working about a month ago. The date we should get our new one keeps getting pushed back and we still don't know when we will get it.< /text>

< review>
So their business hours are 9:30 til 6pm. It’s 10:21 and nobody is still there. For the price that you pay for these apartments you would think you could reach someone anytime. Ummmmm no. But let your rent be late or that what they call a front porch be dirty. You will receive a notice so fast. 🤦🏾‍♀️ 🤬🤬🤬 this is terrible. Now it’s 90 degrees outside and one of my clients windows will not open and nobody to actually talk to. I guess this is how they treat their disabled tenants. DO NOT MOVE OVER HERE. The company that does the landscaping will go through your outside storage. When asked what are they doing they say looking for their stuff. Not in my clients property 🤔🤔😒😒 not to mention they start cutting the grass at 7:30🤦🏾‍♀️ what about the 3rd shift tenants that just got off of work🤔🤔🤔 save yourself and others. DO NOT RENT FROM HERE!< /review>

<Review>I think there is some need for re-organization and clarity in the way that apartments are rented here, as well as condition of overall apartment. Overall, there isn't really a sense of community here as everyone does what they please. I am currently still waiting for a dishwasher and have no clarity on when I will be getting one.

Pros of my experience:
Quick move-in
Ease of freeway access
Proximity to shopping/gym
Ability for lease break

Cons of my experience:
Apartment was not thoroughly checked to be functioning properly at move-in (internet wired incorrectly - requiring paint damage as wall socket was painted over, dishwasher broken)
Paint lines are poor
Soft spot in floor - was told ‘that’s how it is here’
Screen door/door handle aren’t secure - was told ‘that’s how it is here
Hard to get to laundry room - easier to drag from apartment as there is no easy access parking to this area of the complex
Dumpsters constantly overflowing - trash left after garbage pickup
Supposedly non-smoking but several individuals have been smoking in parking lots/apartments
Number of outlets don't work in each room (seems as though overhead lights used to exist in each room and no longer do.)
Mold in the shower at move-in< /Review>< pictures>

Do not recommend moving here , when we first moved in our lease was of 2 years , we ended up reniewing our lease for another 24 month we were told we were getting an “early bird special” of $300 off our upcoming rent , turns out the manager forgot all about and those $300 were never discounted.  Emailed them , went to the office more than 2 times they said they would get it taken care of and email us , Never did we receive an email up until this day that amount is sitting in our outstanding balance and still hasn’t gotten taken care of. Just to show they didn’t keep their word.< /Review>

I cannot express how great our experience at Hidden Cove has been for my family and I over this past year. Property managers and staff are here to listen and be quick to respond and find a solution to any questions or concerns. The maintenance staff  is not only professional and efficient, but polite and friendly. All of these efforts have produce a community atmosphere and have allowed my family to thrive during these times.<//review>

<text>I do not recommend renting here. Take your time and money elsewhere. The support team is oh so quick to contact you when you want to start leasing or come take a tour. But once you start your lease, good luck getting in contact with them. Also to pay your rent online with a card its $50, or you can mail in your payment and still have to pay $10. I broke my lease on military orders and signed all my final documents online, one of which said I do not request cleaners to be paid for at $130. Im still getting charged the 130 on top of a paint fee of 100 when the paint was already botched when we moved in, that was also previously noted on our move-in discrepancy sheet. I’d love to see or hear the reasons you guys think a cleaner and painters crew is require on my expense. Just crazy aint it? Out of my 500 deposit im getting back i will get 90 of it. Money hungry scam artists that never answer emails or phone calls. Move somewhere else, spend your money on a better complex, dont hassle with these cons.< /text>< UserId.>

I really love living here at Hidden Cove! I've been living here for 4 years and plan to stay for a long time. This is my home. The community is so homey and safe! My neighbors are so cool and I feel like I have a little family on my side of the building. I love the staff and how attentive they are to any needs I have. The maintenance technicians have always been here on time for any home issues and have made sure they can fix any problem I come across. If I contact management for rent issues or delay due to my Covid job loss they are so helpful and considerate and help us come to a reasonable plan. They make sure I'm up to date on any new laws and help me make sure I can find a solution to stay with these extenuating circumstances. I've been devastatingly impacted financially and they worked with me while I get caught up in a reasonable time because they really care about their tenants. I have no stress living here and am so grateful I can call this place my home. My dog loves the fields surrounding every building and it's so doggy friendly here. I recommend living here in Hidden Cove 2.</review>

<Review>I have lived here for a year, and I can honestly say it is a pretty decent place to live. The only issues I have had are sometimes people parking in my numbered spot that I have to pay for, but if you are a resident you do have the right to call a tow truck to remove the vehicle. It's just annoying when you get home late after work and cant find another spot. Also, there have been times when people have not been courteous about the laundry room (not cleaning up after themselves, leaving clothes in all day). I would rent the units that have the washer and dryer inside the apt. Other than that, I love the dog park, and being so close to the freeway but it actually being quite around my building. Overall, it's a quiet place to live!<//Review>< time>

<Review>This place has a great community vibe. There are a lot of families with kids that live here and plenty of amenities to keep them busy. We were lucky to be living here at the time COVID hit. The community and neighbors gave my kids a sense of normalcy during that chaos.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Just moved in recently and have had nothing short of a great experience! They got us moved in super quickly even with covid everything went super smoothly. Karla is amazing and has been so helpful! Live in hidden cove II and have no complaints. Was worried about it not being gated but it’s very secluded so not being gated isn’t a concern.
Would definitely recommend living here!</Review>

<Text>I live in HIdden Cove II and am very happy so far! The atmosphere is fairly quiet with the hum from cars passing on the 15 freeway nearby. The location works well since it's easy to get on the 15 or the 78 from here. The grounds are well maintained and it helps to have central air and a small washer/dryer.

DO NOT RENT HERE! These apartments seem so much nicer on the photos than in person. Your utilities AREN’T $80 to $100 as Carla and the property manager say.  I have been paying an additional $200 to $300 worth of utilities per month for a simple apartment! The pantry cabinets are painted unprofessionally not to mention the cheap wood those cabinets are made out of. When it comes to maintenance requests even after submitting a request they take an EXCESSIVE amount of days to assist, maintenance always seemed to be standing around. The main gates are always breaking down. Unacceptable for the amount you’re paying. Carla & Anthony are always in the office but NEVER SEEM TO ANSWER THE PHONE, you can confirm this by asking any of the tenants. Within the first 2 weeks of my move in day we’ve seen a few roaches in the cabinets corners and the back of the refrigerator. We decided not to make a big deal and instead act on it out of our expense. Mind you they do not tell you that you are already paying a minimal fee monthly. Fast forward a few months into our 2 YEAR LEASE a bunch of roaches started coming in through the AC vents only to spread quickly and hard to prevent the infestation into the apartment. Throughout our 20month lease plenty of service requests were submitted, they seem to not care. The office would blame the delay on the terminator. The terminator blamed the office on service requests being delayed. You can hear Rats inside the walls of the kitchen cabinets but have not seen them yet. YES RATS. UNSANITARY. If I could give it 0 stars I would. When you move out you WILL NOT GET YOUR DEPOSIT BACK. Yes, $500 deposit GONE. You won’t get it back no matter how clean the apartment is. If there are uncontrollable roaches they will charge you for new appliances which could be up to $2,000 out of your own pocket. The office stated “roaches on appliances is our fault as in the tenants.” Four times within the 20 month period they did not fumigate (minor in apartment) and that is the reason why they are trying to hold us accountable for the roaches infestation on appliances. You’d think they would bill you a prorated amount for those 4x they had to “waste “ time on going to the apartment and we declined service due to a minor being in the apartment. BUT no instead the way they address this inconvenient situation is by billing a little over $2,000. Very unprofessional. Unsanitary.</text>

{'time': 1605834688231, 'text': 'Hello, I wanted to thank you for your feedback and follow up with you with regards to your experiences at Hidden Cove. I have contacted my leadership team at Hidden Cove to address your concerns. For every month utilities were between $85 - $136. Here at Hidden Cove we take a standard approach in billing utilities and they are done so in arrears. Utility charges at Hidden Cove typically show up two months after move-in, therefore at the time of move out you may see up to 2 months of utilities applied to the account. The apartment was a classic apartment, not newly renovated and with original cabinetry. Upgraded apartments are available. In reviewing completed service requests all were handled and completed within 48 hours. Our gates are not always broken and when there is a service issue our vendor is contacted for immediate repairs. Our staff answers dozens of calls daily and if they are on tour with a prospect or on a resident call voice mails will be followed up. To fully address the pest control it was reported by our professional exterminators that prep work was not completed, there were unsanitary conditions exacerbating the problem and several treatment refusals occurred leaving this unattended. When the required instructions and prep work were not completed, and self- treatments occurred instead, this resulted in appliance replacement and charges for additional pest treatments. I hope I have provided some answers to your experiences. Please contact your Community Manager directly if you have any other questions. -Susan'}<//response>

I really like living at Hidden Cove. It’s conveniently located, I’m in love with my apartment, and the online portal makes paying rent and making service requests insanely simple (with a super quick turn around time). In all honesty though, there are some things that are unnecessarily difficult. For instance, it’s extremely hard to contact a person actually in the leasing office. Very rarely are there actually people inside the office, which is understandable as they are most likely doing their jobs and showing people units. However what this does make difficult is acquiring guest parking passes. For example, the office is open at extremely restrictive times that make it difficult for people who work during the day. Another thing they do not let you know is that they closed on Mondays. Again, none of these issues would be a problem if they made certain things that tenants need on a day to day basis a little more convenient. Hidden Cove is great, but definitely expect to be quite annoyed and inconvenienced by the simplest of things.< /Text>

Do yourself a favor and rent somewhere else. For starters, Karla was only helpful when we were trying to lease. After we signed, she was impossible to get ahold of. Even during working hours no one is at the leasing office and they’re impossible to get ahold of. There was one time when my mailbox key broke and I was unable to get a new key for a whole week because they never answer their phone and were not at the leasing office. It’s crazy how during work hours no one answers the phone but when I pull up to the leasing center, Karla is always outside on her phone. I’ve had to call the leasing office and pretend like I’m interested in getting an apartment just to get a hold of them. It’s ridiculous. Like people have mentioned in the reviews, the apartments look nothing like the pictures. The smallest details such as the paint job inside the apartments look very messy and like it was carelessly done. Parking is very hard to find and they do not strictly enforce the towing of cars without a parking permit. Regarding cleanliness there are some days where the dog waste baskets are not emptied out and it overflows. They do not seem to care that there are some pet owners who do not clean up after their pets.I always look at reviews before u buy something or try a new place out. If the reviews are bad then I stay away from the place or product. I really wish I would’ve listened to everyone’s horrible reviews and saved myself the time, pain and money.< /review>

We apologize that you have found it difficult to reach our staff. Our office is open 5 days a week from 10 AM – 6PM Tuesday- Friday and 10 AM – 5 PM on Saturday. The only time the office would be closed is a lunch break for our staff member on a Saturday.  All service requests, such as a broken mail box key, are completed in the order they are received unless it is an emergency. We would be happy to review your request for this service. To address our apartment photos, we have video tours of all units and show all applicants a similar unit they are leasing if one is not available to see during their tour. Our pet waste baskets are emptied daily by our maintenance team. Grounds are walked multiple times to ensure any pet waste is removed and dog waste stations are stocked with bags and emptied. We can address any resident that is not picking up after their pet, we just need their information or apartment number. Our parking lots have multiple vehicles towed per night for not having a valid permit shown. Residents are also welcome to report any vehicles to our courtesy patrol. We have not been able to find you in our system but would like the opportunity to personally address your review.

The leasing office does not respond to emails and literally never answers their phone unless you are interested in leasing.  If you have a serious building concern they will not respond to emails.  The washer has been only washing on hot  for over a year and they won't change it as they can't repair it.  This is the worse leasing company I have ever dealt with.  It is amazing that a complex of this size abandons their tenants. DON'T lease an apartment here!  This is not related to Covid 19 either.<//Review>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Review>Whatever you think your rent is, add about $150 a month to it.  They pass along every single expense to the renters as fees.  Sewer, pest control, even fees called 'Energy Conservation fee' and 'Service fee'.  If a resident moves out and leaves a bunch of extra trash out in the common areas, they pass along that expense as a fee to all the remaining renters.  That expense should be paid by the person that left their trash out.  Not all of us tenants.  I've rented all over San Diego at many different complexes but I've never experienced the kind of thorough fee scheme that Hidden Cove uses. I've also witnessed first hand that they have a predatory towing arrangement with a local towing company; the towing company patrols the lot in the early morning hours for cars without a permit, and tows them quickly and quietly without warning or notice.</Review>< Pictures>

Everyone I have dealt with has been friendly and professional. Service request handled very fast. Parking is no issue and all the residents are very respectful, no on taking two spaces or parking on the line so you can't open your door. Apartments are beautiful and the walk in master closet is a dream for someone like me with lots of clothes and shoes. I couldn't be happier with our decision to make Hidden Cove 2 our home.<//Text>

I have been here for almost 1 year and love this place!  The maintenance are always professional and very quick to fix any problems in my apartment.  The office staff are exceptional and are always very helpful.  I just love the large amount of room and grass my children have to play on in the front of the apartment.  We love the clean pool and fitness center.  This is truly a place we can call home.< /Review>

< Review>
We live in Hidden Cove south, the newer apartments with great utilities. I wish they would warn you about how awful the management is, and how little they care. We have extremely loud neighbors. Constantly loud. From daytime to nighttime our walls are shaking from the bass. They constantly are screaming profanities at each other and we can hear every word. We have called “courtesy patrol” multiple times but they never seem to actually make it to their door, gone to the front office and have even told them that WE would take our time to transfer apartments in the same complex. They shared that we could but for quite a hefty financial fee and a lease break. We don’t want to break our lease just to break it, we want to go somewhere we can enjoy being at home and being able to sleep. So why are we being punished? Courtesy patrol is at the point where they told us to start getting the police involved for each incident so we are. The front office is of no help so we are going to simply call law enforcement from now on.</Review>

Very unprofessional!! None of the leasing agents know what they are doing. Rent increases about $100 every year. Wendy you don’t what the hell you are talking about. You guys steal money with all the extra move out charges. So happy to move out. TERRIBLE PLACE TO LIVE!! DO NOT MOVE HERE!!!<//text>

I’ve wanted to move out since the day I moved in! COCKROACHES are out of control and they don’t seem to care. Worst apartment complex I’ve ever lived in.
1. Parking is atrocious. My car was towed the first day I moved in and cost me $300. I also pay $45 a month to park in my own complex.
2. NO AC even though they tell you there is. It’s a tiny wall unit in the kitchen so the bedrooms are 100 degrees in the summer. Fans don’t help. We sweat to death and didn’t sleep all summer.
3. Dog poop everywhere. Management doesn’t care even if you report it.
4. Dirty sidewalks and trash bins overflowing. Everywhere you look it’s filthy.
5. Laundry room is always dirty and half the time the machines don’t work.
6. COCKROACHES roaming freely on the sidewalks at night and infest your apartment.
7. Patio is always dirty from the trees dropping so it’s not even usable.
8. Horrible living room layout so there’s no space for anything.
DO NOT MOVE HERE< /text>

<Review>Our experience has been wonderful so far. From the initial leasing process to the move-in process, all my questions were answered in a timely fashion and I felt "in the loop" the whole time. After move-in, we had just one maintenance request. I submitted it late on a Friday, and the service technician was at my apartment by Saturday morning to fix it and then proceeded to ask if there was any other issues we would like him to look at before he left. The complex (grounds, pool, laundry facility, etc.) is also very clean and well maintained as well!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

For so long I dreamed about finally settling in somewhere that I felt safe and comfortable. I have lived in many locations and places prior to my move in at Hidden Cove and I must say I finally found my Blessing. There are so many extras here like a gym, pool, Jacuzzi and a mini play area for the kiddos. There's also a school across the way, the 15 freeway for away transfer to work, there are so many stores all around for those of you who love shopping but have busy lifestyles.  They are Dog friendly and welcome our four legged members with open arms. 😊 I must also mention that the staff here are very genuine and sincere when it comes to meeting your needs. Maintenance and all the members there are on it when there are needed repairs requested. I couldn't be more pleased with the way Karla Easter handled my move in. She made sure that my apt was move in ready and she sure met all of my needs. I am very grateful and so glad I said yes. So if you are looking for a place to call home, come in for a tour and see if this place suits your life style. Thank you Hidden Cove.<//Text><Name>Fabiola Ramirez< /Name></record></dataset><record>

I have lived here at Hidden Cove since I was a child (moved away but then returned when I became a young adult) and I had a good experience here. Unfortunately that is no longer the case. My car, along with a few cars parked right outside of the gate of the complex, we’re vandalized. The interior of my car was absolutely ruined with a food substance being thrown all over the front seat, passenger seat, backseats, and dashboard. My car was parked inside of the complex when this happened. I do not blame Hidden Cove for what happened, but I do feel like more action could have been taken. I had nothing but okay experiences when I called and talked to the managers at the leasing office, but I did not feel that they necessarily cared for what happened. My sense of safety and security did not get better as they weren’t very reassuring that they would try their best to help prevent this from happening again. My suggestion to the apartments is to raise the vigilance and security in the apartments. It is unfortunately common to hear about cars being stolen and broken into from INSIDE the complex. If my family and I are paying over +2,000 a month to live here, I would hope that they would have the best interest of their residents in mind by maybe placing more security cameras throughout the complex and increasing the patrols within the gates. People are supposed to feel safe in their homes but I can no longer say that I feel safe. I really hope they try to do what they can to decrease the issues that have been happening within the complex, as this isn’t the only thing I’ve been dealing with as of late (downstairs neighbors have been smoking nonstop even after us reporting it to management). I really hope that it’s just me that may have had bad experiences here and that no one else feels scared for their property and their family as I do now. I hope my opinion changes in the future as I enjoyed living here. But the only thing I feel now is fear.<//Text>

Rented us out 2 car port spots that were actually already taken. Our car got towed by the first spot owner, and the office was closed the next 2 days, so we had to eat a $350+ Towing fee I until they reopened. Still haven’t gotten the credit back on our account and it’s been a few weeks. Moving is already hard, getting towed in the first week.
UPDATE:
DO NOT MOVE HERE. MANAGER IS TERRIBLE, STAFF IS EVEN WORSE. Called over 50 times just in the last week and STILL nothing. Emailed the manager MULTIPLE times. STILL nothing. This isn’t because of COVID-19 either. This has been an ONGOING issue. I honestly can’t believe how much we pay for this type of service. Please save yourselves.< /text>

<Text>Love the location. The units are older but well kept. The only major complaint I have is all the hidden fees. Renters insurance I anticipated, but its $15 just to be able to have your car on the property plus an additional $30 if you want a covered assigned parking. Then on top of all of that there is a 2.95% service fee to make your rent payment ... ends up being around $50-60 just to take my money! None of which was clearly explained during the rental process.</Text></record></dataset><record>

We have lived here for two years and we enjoy living here. The complex is well maintained and it’s so quiet. The office staff and maintenance workers are all friendly and polite and for it being a pet friendly community you’d never know it. They keep the complex clean and your rarely see or hear dogs barking. It’s conveniently located off the freeway, to shopping and restaurants. We definitely recommend living here.</review>

So far everything is great! Only bad thing is that we paired our rent using the portal and oddly enough it didn’t go through and we were charged a late fee. Luckily I saved via screenshot the confirmation of the payment being made! From now i we will be using checks. So heads up on that! But other than that everything is great, it’s nice and quite here! We have a 2 bedroom and is very spacious! We love it!</Review>

This place seemed great when we decided to move in! Once the first bill came we see all these extra fees! $30 just for a carport parking! They don't give you a complimentary parking just for already being a renter. You seriously have to pay for every space & it's not a guarantee you'll even find one! They have a 3rd party meter the water, sewer, trash and we get billed for the statements they send out! I don't need the statement since the same information is on the online portal provided by Hidden Cove! Management is a joke! You question the fees & they just want to get you off the phone. They never answer & when they do some are clueless and seem like they need to be educated. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE to anyone who is wanting to move up in life or even if an apartment is your choice of living. The fees WILL go up every month and the rent yearly!< /Review>

Being that I just moved here from Mississippi less than one month ago the search for an apartment was kind of rigorous.. Hidden Cove and the entire staff has been Incredibly helpful.. I just recently signed a 12 month lease and couldn’t be happier with not only my apartment, but the quickness in which work orders have been done by maintenance..
Thanks again Hidden Cove totally worth five stars...⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️< /text>

My mother moved into Hidden Cove in September 2013.  She likes living there, it is clean and quiet.  There are some issues with pricing, there is too many items not included in the base rent price.  What she is very pleased with is the service.  Every time she calls to have some item looked at, it gets attended to within the day.  The office and service people have been professional and polite.  We just recently had and issue of a slowly leaking pipe that had been putting water behind the bathroom wall.
Jennifer sent someone out immediately to check it out.  When found out, the pipe was repaired the same day.  They had to mitigate any mold issues, which was done the next day.  All of the people the interacted with my mother were very polite to her and attentive of her needs and desires.</review>

<Text>Hidden Cove has been great for us!

There will always be issues anywhere you live, especially in an apartment complex but the Hidden Cove management team has always been responsive to any issues we've had (noisy, smoking neighbors but haven't smelled it since complaining!) and maintenance is quick and efficient the few times we've had to request their services.

This complex has great amenities: pools, hot tubs, fitness center, doggy waste stations. It's also very open and green and we have a great view from our balcony.

The apartment itself is great! Hardwood floors, vaulted ceilings, spacious with central air and in unit washer/dryer, which are hard to find in an apartment. I feel like we're paying a fair price for everything we get. We're definitely happier here than we were at our last place!</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
"My wife Maria and I love living at Hidden Cove. When we first moved to SoCal in June 2015 we wondered if we would be able to find an affordable apartment that was also very nice and up to date in a quiet neighborhood. Well with Hidden Cove we were able to find a great apartment at a good price that met our needs and really does make us feel like we have a home again."
"Adding to what we wrote before it's been 9 months since we started living at Hidden Cove and we still love it.  Although we live less than a mile from the Escondido Promenade and I15 it seems like we have a quiet home in the country.  The location is very convenient and the staff keep things running very smoothly.  The apartment has been easy to maintain, trouble free and parking has never been a problem.  Hidden Cove is a great place to live."</Review>

<review>My fiancé and I have loved living here. We moved in around a year ago and haven't had issues save for some unsavory neighbors that moved in recently below us, but that's no reflection on the complex itself. It should be noted that whenever we lodged a complaint about the neighbors I mentioned, the front office was always quick and responsive, and the maintenance team has been as well, usually out at our apartment the next day to fix whatever issue we have.

The fitness center leaves a lot to be desired, as they only have a few machines and no barbells at all. The dumbbell set only goes up to 50lbs. as well, and one of the 35lbs dumbbells is missing.

It's pet friendly, and they provide waste bags for dogs which is nice. Yes, it's pricey to live here, but you have to know that going into it. It's unfair to the complex to move in and then complain about the cost of everything when you knew beforehand that that was the case.

All in all, it's been a pleasurable experience with the green scenery, beautiful trees, and our lovely apartment with its vaulted ceilings. All of our friends and family love coming over, and we love hosting. I would recommend this complex to anyone.< /review>< Pics>

I would give minus five star.  People are nice and polite (sometimes) however,  They can be very cruel when it comes to money. No guess parking. You need to get guest parking sticker otherwise your guest will pay over $250 tow fee. Heating and cooling is bad.<//review>

<text>The apartments themselves and the amenities are great, but there is a catch. The water bill. Never once have I been charged $145-170 a month for water usage. The culprit, the “community share” of what the complex uses to water the grass and fill the pools. So essentially it is a hidden HOA fee without disclosing it. They’ve mentioned they try their best to limit use yet they water the grass for an hour around 10-11am as the sun hits the grass...not very conservative if you ask me... If I had known this information prior to signing our lease, I may have gone with a different place. Now you know.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
We were lucky enough to get an apartment in the O building facing the back.  It was quiet and perfect for us at the time.  The balconies are large, much bigger than any of the other apartment complexes in the North County of San Diego. The gym has everything you need and is always clean, as well as, the three sparkling pools.  The service team were always attentive to our needs and very courteous and helpful at all times.  Mario and Eddie are two of the service men that deserve some praise for their dedication to excellent service, both always go over and beyond the call of their duty.  I was very impressed.  During our stay we never saw a single station run out of doggy bags and there is so much green grass for the dog to play around on, it's a little haven in the middle of the chaos.  Note there are two sections to Hidden cove, the back section, I think is nicer and more spacious and the front which is a little more congested, which is why you probably get two different types of reviews.  Since the new management joined the standards have gone up and the quality of care has improved.  Christy Arnold is doing a great job and so are the current staff at hidden cove.  I have absolutely no complaints, only praise!  Well done Hidden Cove for making our experience with you enjoyable and hassle free. I would definitely recommend Hidden Cove to anyone looking for a home in the area. P.S. Just make sure you give 2 months notice when leaving, it's not the normal 1 month notice. Thanks Hidden Cove.< /Review>

<review>I have had my car towed for a second time.  The management allows a towing company to tow residents cars so that they can profit and for what. There are so many open spaces already. I pay to park inside the gates have tags and stickers and my car still gets towed.  You are not a resident of this place but a prisoner.  I'm sure some prisoners get better treatment that they residents of this place.  Low quality of life.  Low standard of living.  High cost to rent here. Do yourself a favor and look somewhere else.< /review>< GmapID>

{'time': 1536681230142, 'text': "Marissa, we do not have any hidden fees, as all charges are expressed clearly in lease agreements. The $40 fee applies to credit card payments, but an ACH credit payment with a linked-up bank account has absolutely no charge. Also, carport parking and lot parking are charged separately. If you only have one vehicle and elect to pay for reserved carport parking, you will not be charged the $15 lot parking cost. You are correct that first month's utilities are charged at move out; this is because it takes about a month before the utilities are property linked up to a newly-leased unit, so that first month is billed retroactively. Finally, it is not necessarily the case that you will be charged a cleaning or painting fee upon move out. So long as your unit is brought back to the same condition it was received, you will not be charged any fees. If you have any questions about any of this, please feel free to reach out to me at ICanHelp@Aimco.com. Thanks! -George"}<//resp>

Be aware renting here that there are many HIDDEN fees. How ironic!! Every month you will be charged a service fee of $40 when trying to pay rent!! As well as if you plan on getting a parking that is covered you will still have to pay for the normal parking as well it can not be take off the rent so you will end up paying $30 for covered parking along with an extra $15 so $45 in parking. If you get home from work after 6:00pm there will be NO parking that isn't covered most of the time! DO NOT EXPECT to receive your deposit back they will take the last month closing fees for water, trash out of the deposit, as well as  charge a cleaning fee and PAINT FEE!! Ridiculous I only lived here for 6 months?! The laundry rooms are covered in dog hairs as well so be aware when washing clothes. As well as some residents do not pick up their dogs restroom.</text>

Pros:
Conveniently located, across the street from major shopping center and easy access to the 15 and the 78

For the most part have had friendly and quiet neighbors

New laundry facility with nice machines that take a card not coins

For a one bedroom it’s actually not too small

Maintenance has always been friendly and helpful, very quick to respond and take care of any issues

Cons:
Hard to find parking, unless you pay an extra $30 fee for reserved spot

No ac unit in bedroom (only heater?), so we had to purchase one since it’s unbearable in the middle of a California summer

The two issues we’ve had with noise: the first was when our neighbor next to our bedroom had their alarm right next to the wall and we heard it go off for over an hour every morning around four or five am, however we have new neighbors now and have no problem; the second is there’s a number of cars in our lot that have sensitive alarms and will go off for hours, a bit frustrating if you’re trying to work or sleep at home

After our first few months we had an issue with rent (my paycheck was late and this was before the credit card option online), we didn’t know that past the due date you get kicked out of your account, so we had a scary moment of trying to rush to the bank to get a cashiers check before closing, remember all the extra fees to process a check and the late fee, rush back to the leasing office before closing and before they kicked us out of our apartment. This was the first time we were late (with a good reason) and the guy working the office (unfortunately don’t remember his name) was very uncaring and unhelpful. When we got back to the office the manager Lauren was there, and when we explained our situation she had a completely different attitude, apologized and waived the extra fees. If it wasn’t for her we may have left a long time ago.

Bottom Line:
For the most part, the cons are typical apartment issues you’ll find at most places, not much you can do about it. Overall our experience has been pleasant which is why we’ve stayed over two years here.< /Review>

Having so many store across the st and the freeway so near by is so convenient! HOWEVER, they don't notify you when parking fee's go up even though your contract states one thing & their restrooms suck! I have another friend living here and he has no problems with his so i don't know if it's just in my building but my restroom is loud and every time I call maintenance for this they all say it's normal but I know it's not and the loudness is annoying. The showers also suck when you put the water to warm/hot water less and less water comes out so it's uncomfortable to shower with very little water.<//Review>

For the most part my concerns at this location are the people living here who do not follow the rules. This place is a very beautiful establishment when taken care of, however I find that the maintenance people then to have to pick up after others. Some improvements have been made and the new management is listening to those of us that care about this place and enjoy the changes. A little pricey especially with all the little add ons' but very convenient location.< /Review>

<Review>If I can give 0 star then I will. The worst place I have lived ever. My car got towed when I was in vacation. I have a valid sticker and rent a parking lot there, but the apartment manager allowed towing company to get in and tow my car because my registration is expired! They didn't email me or call me before my car was towed! Also the rent is way too high for the low quality.  Do yourself a favor, do not move to here.

It's hard to say it's this apartment's fault. Some pet owners just never pick up after their pet and then, no one would clean the poops. It's disgusting especially in hot days.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

< Review>
Heed the warnings of the reviewers and listen to the reviews...RENT AT YOUR OWN RISK!

I'm giving this place 2 stars because it hasn't been all bad living here. It's convenient (close to shopping, restaurants, and the highway), quiet for the most part (unless you live downstairs then can hear your upstairs neighbors because of thin floors), and pet friendly (if you want the option for a pet). However, after living for 2 yrs there, it's not as nice as they make it out to be. First of all the rent is RIDICULOUSLY expensive for even here in southern CA. If you look at their website, they want $2000-$8,000 for their 980 sq ft. Who has that kind of money? Unless you can live with roommates, there's no way a family could afford that. And the apartments aren't that nice for the price. Second, if you live in the back buildings, the lawn isn't maintained. There are dead trees and leaves covering the ground. Irresponsible pet owners leave dog feces in which the lawn and garden people don't pick it up but either mow over it or leave it so someone might step in it. Not to mention the dead rats that they take their time collecting after you've called to have them removed. Maintenance sometimes takes forever to address the issues in your apartment so you have to call to get someone (which I'm told is because they're low staffed). Then there are the fees. You have to pay for parking ($15 for non-covered, $30 for covered) PER vehicle. Water is not covered so you're paying for that as well which is split among your building so essentially you are paying for someone else's usage. And the water bill just went up (the complex cites as over consumption of water usage). Also, beware of the "hidden fees" (yes there are hidden fees despite what you're told). When you move out, expect to be hit with a fee for that as well as paying for trash and sewer (which was supposedly included in your rent) as well as any dings, dents, or scratches they find in which they constitute as "damages". They also take your deposit (without your knowledge or permission instead of getting it back) to add to your final move out charges. And then there's the issue of move out notifications. You have to give a 60 day notice to vacate but if you vacate within the 60 days, you're responsible for paying the FULL 2 months (unless they find a renter sooner in which you would be prorated for the days you stayed), which is not stated in the contract. CA law says you only are responsible for 30 days, regardless of personal policies.

If you have financial problems, don't expect these people to help. They only care about their money. They want you to pay for everything and don't care what your financial situation is. They lost my rent check TWICE, tried to blame me for not paying, then expected me to pay double. Luckily good rental history forced them to work with me. You can also not expect the onsite leasing manager to help either.

So moral of the story, rent here only if you want to be taken advantage of. I'm glad I'm out of there now. I've found a much better place to live and with landlords who seem to care.

(And yes "George" I know you say there's no hidden fees and you can help but there is from my own experience and I've tried but you didn't.)<//Review>

Got some small maintenance problems while moving it and it was fixed the same day.

THIS IS THE WORST PLACE EVER!
I cannot advise you enough the stay away from this place. The have no respect and will nickel and dime you. They are rude and unprofessional. I hated every second living here. Do yourself a favor and read the google reviews and yelp reviews ! Do Not even tour this place. It may seem pretty on the exterior but it isnt worth the hell that comes with it when you become a resident.
Oh.. and good luck moving out without them squeezing every penny they can out of you!!< /text>

Oh my gosh!  Do not rent here... this place is scary!  I have been living here for the past year, and they are charging me extra for not giving them beyond a 30 day notice.  Threatened and are not giving me back my security deposit let alone charging me extra for my apartment fees they haven't even seen yet.  I now owe $1600, and they're trying to set up a payment plan.  They do this to all of their rentees and it is against the law.<//review>

< Review>
When we first moved in, our apartment caught on fire due to some faulty wiring. It wasn't our fault, yet the management seemed intent on pushing for a lawsuit. After that my room mates and I got pressured into leasing another place which was considerably worse in terms of area. They also had the balls to tell us to not give them a bad review and to base our experience with this place before the fire had happened. My room mate also got a call to remove a "tarp" from our EMPTY patio. If you have more than one car and live near the pools, you'll be hard pressed just to find parking, as most of the parking gets taken by guest and other people who park near the pool.

After all the fiasco with the fire, we don't feel at all welcome here. Should've just gotten another place than stay here in Hidden Coves. For sure not renewing our lease.<//Review>

DO NOT DO IT! This place was awful. My elderly parents rented an apartment here so that they could move closer to me. They show a very nice apartment and then put you in a different one. One that is less maintained. They moved a family of 5 above my parents. This family was loud and often fought. After several complaints with no response from management I moved my parents out. We agreed to pay the penalty per our lease. The staff never posted this amount to the account so we were unable to pay. After move out they sent my parents a bill for 11k. Adding more stress. Luckily, we had our several attempts to pay in writing. After a lengthy email to upper management they finally rectified the situation. The nightmare is now over. Save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere!<//Text>

This apartment has been a very stressful place for my fiance and I to live. My car was broken into twice, although when we signed our contract we were told it was a very safe gated community with nightly security patrols. The patrols are highly inconsistent, and the gates break often and aren't repaired for weeks at a time. When we confronted the leasing office with our safety concerns, they merely offered to have security patrol more often (which never happened).
Maintenance crew was very nice and responsive, however, getting ahold of any staff from the leasing office was impossible. Many messages left, and none answered until they were called repeatedly. Upon, move out, we were told since we were only a few days late with notifying them (as we had been searching for another apartment still in the interum) that there would be no late fee. This was discussed both over the phone and over email. Our final statement was issued and there was a $370 late fee added, to which they responded that they had never even called us, so our statement concerning the fee was inaccurate and that a notice had been left on our deck (which we never saw). They took it out of our security deposit instead (with no notification, although we tried to pay it with rent) and charged us $135 to touch up two spots of paint on our walls. I do not recommend this apartment; it is not as secure as they make it out to be, the staff is inattentive, uncommunicative, and rude. The apartment itself wasn't too bad, although the AC only ever cooled down the living room. However, the paint on our tub cracked on several occassions, causing mildew and mold to grow.</Review>

Very nice looking place, My leasing girl Felicia was very nice about everything. But when I went to the place they ask me to apply which my boyfriend I did. Did not realize i also payed 500 holding fee. I quickly called that same day within minutes. Spoke with a gentlemen name Anthony about wanting a refund about my 500 because i was still browsing around to see where would be the best home for my boyfriend and I. Anthony was very pushy about leaving the 500 holding fee, and its ok for me to still be browsing. What he fail. to communicate or tell me is that within my 24 hours I would not be able to get my 500 back. so a little over week went by. And when I email Felicia about not moving forward on the apartment she informed me I only had 24 hours since when I applied to get the 500 holding fee. What frustrates me is i called the same day and never was told any of this. I basically got robbed my 500 dollars and taken advantage. I really did like hidden cove apartments. But by someone not giving me the right information i get screwed in the end. Lucky me this all happen all before the holidays. Thank  you HiddenCove</text>

The inside of the apartments and community are very well kept and beautiful. The staff pretends to care about any issue you present and the maintenance staff lags on fixing any issues. A/C was down for a weekend and they went on vacation before fixing it. It was 100 degrees this weekend. Also, when I moved in most of the outlets didn't work and I had to put in an order for them to be fixed, and there was a mass mold growth in my dishwasher that I cleaned after finding a God awful stench the first time I used the dishwasher. The office hours are not real, they leave early, show up late, and never answer the phone. Oh, and they changed the 30 day move out policy to 60 days, without warning me or my neighbors, so my neighbor had to deal with that, but warned me ahead of time. And the website says "gated community". HA! Lies, theres a gate in the front part, but there are two other undated entrances, thus my neighbors Jeep was stolen and never found, and my car was broken into and the side mirrors were stolen off my car. Excellent.<//review>

I can't rate them lower or I would have rated negative 5 stars. Totally unprofessional staff, I was completely ignored when I went to look at a couple of units for rent and was made to feel like a 2nd class citizen when I asked for assistance- would NEVER rent from them now. Had every intention of paying for a year in advance too as I am here from out of state for my job, sad.<//Text>

THIS PLACE IS A TOLIET!! LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS I SHOULD HAVE!!  I regrettably live here with my wife now and hate it more and more every day.  Hidden surprise charges not mentioned in the base rent are just one of the many joys here at the "Hidden Cove."  They are nazis about parking and what you do with your own patio that you pay a insane amount of money for.  Straight up lied to me saying I could leave my motorcycle own my patio at night (which was a deciding factor in moving here) which I asked Ricardo the leasing consultant CLEAR AS DAY and was told that that would be fine.  Only to be harassed about it by the rude office manager being told I had to move it "sooner rather then later." even though her employee assured me it would be fine.  The office is rude and unhelpful, anytime I have to interact with the office they all act like they are doing you a huge favor by talking to you.

Hidden surprise charges not mentioned in the base rent are just one of the many joys here at the "Hidden Cove."  They are nazis about parking and what you do with your own patio that you pay a insane amount of money for.

crazy $30/35 charge for extra car ports... and the fact that they have landscapers literally monday thru friday making crazy noise from 7 am to about 230pm.

I work afternoon/evening shifts so i mostly sleep through the day and every single day i wake up because of them. Also, your car will never stay clean for the same reason...the leafblowers... 🙄

They have security come in every once in a while...youll literally see them once or twice a month. Things have been stolen from our cars + our neighbors and when we tell management they dont do anything about it,  Whata joke!

Oh and let me tell you the rent is crazy!  About $1750 a month   also, no central A/C  its horrible during the summer.<//text>

Initially, you feel right at home when you come in to take a tour, with a cookie, and a beverage, while you wait for 30 to 90 minutes. You try to be understanding and accept their apologies for putting everyone else,  including themselves, ahead of you.

Then you go on a  tour of the complex where they show you a few units that are very similar to what you'll rent - the only things missing are the insects, roaches, and silverfish; oh yeah, the unit also is missing the moldy cabinets, old toilet, and old bath tubs.

We moved here with the understanding that all the appartments were completely renovated, security gates were to be installed, and that they have a security patrol that would patrol at night. Insead we rented an appartment that was infested with insects, had old fixtures, old tub, old closet doors, old sink, old cabinets - did I mention that my car was broken in to? It was. So later I found out that they never had an intention of putting in a gate, whereas, now we are subject to dumpster divers, pass through crowds, and all the other elements that surround the area.

Like a good person, I made the best of my situation and asked that they at least send a exterminator - they did, but he had to come out many times, and I ended up having to hire my own guy to do this.

BY THE WAY, this company has no compassion - the day that you're late, they send you a 3 DAY PAY OR QUIT NOTICE! Then they start the EVICTION Process.

I haven't been evicted, but I have been late - FOR EXAMPLE: Let's say a holiday falls on a Monday, which is the 3rd, and lets say that you went out of town on Friday, which was the 31st, you would be subject to their process.

It's stupid and you are just another number to them. PERIOD. They don't care.< /Review>

<date>1408837344019< /date><rating>1< /rating><Review>Hidden Cove was my worse place to rent from. They are about exploiting you for money. They are awful regarding communication: I would call several times trying to reach someone in the office, left messages on several occasions but would not get a call back, when you finally stop by the office you hear many excuses especially we did not get a message. Same issue with written communication, I would write them letters on different occasion on concerns, or need for repairs and also would not get a reply. Once there was no water,and no warning. This was a Sunday which ran into Monday. I ended up renting a hotel since for 1 day. When I send them the bill, they claim they will not pay because they have arrangement for residents to do things like shower on the premiss. Also, they had my car towed, when I inquired they claim my looked like it had not been moved recently. What business is their if I go on vacation and leave my car in my assigned paid parking? Makes no sense. It looks like they have some back door deal with the tow company (very unprofessional and rude). When I ask the towing guy for his why he towed my car he bragged: "because I can", I asked if he wish to repeat that (this was a phone call), he refused...maybe was afraid I started recording the call. When I ask for his name, he also refused. This towing company seem to do a better job lurking on the premises looking for cars to tow both day and night, than the office does in communicating. When I went to pick up the car, he told me I can complain to the police and added that they have close relations with the local police office department. Sounds corrupted.The other complaints stated on here is also true. The told me I can't have my bicycle on the patio. The pool area is often noisy even late at night with folks (many seems to be non-resident) hanging around and sometimes inappropriate behaviors. There is also a lot of turn over in the front office. They seems to play games when it comes to lease renewal. E.g. they would indicate a quote you a renewal rate 2 months in advance, then when you stop by to renew, they claim the rate changed and they have no control over it. They renewal is always higher. I have always paid my rent in full and on time. But once I had accidentally use my other checking account to write pay the rent (a mistake I made since I had a death in the family). I did not know I had send them the wrong checking account. I came home from work one day and find letters on my door with threaten lawsuit. I called the office to inquire what happened; and left a message since I didn't reach any one. Next day I got another letter demanding immediate payment by money order. I tried again to reach someone from the office but in vain. Since they open when I am at work I did't have time to wait by their office, so I did the money order during my lunch break and dropped in off in their night box. I included a letter inquiring when happened and for the check I sent them or at least a copy. No response. Other occasion, I cause the manager lying. On my move out, they found ways to change me ridiculous fees, they even changed the lease so they could charge you more. The apartment was left very clean. They pick as things like pulling the ridge and saying it had not been sweep. Same for the stove. Non-sense like these. I simply told them their deeds will follow them. MAKE A STATEMENT BY NOT RENTING AT HIDDEN COVE. Spread the word.They use residence and worship money and robbing you. There are move examples but you get the point.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>My wife and I have been living her for years and there are several times we have felt that the property management cares more about making money instead of its residents.

For example, we have extremely rude neighbors who live in appartment 258 who, every now and again, blast their horrible music so load you can hear it from outside in the parking lot and through the walls several appartments away. We have made several complaints over the years and these people are still allowed to live here.

Another example is that the property management occassionally gives out to many temperary parking passes. It is understandable that they would charge people to get a temp pass, but there have been times that they gave out to many of them and resulted in many of us ACTUAL residents to park on the street. As the property managers you shoul know how many cars are registered to your renters at any given time. We are the ones paying rent which means we should get priority to park inside the complex over guests. If the complex has reached its capacity then you should stop issuing temp passes.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1475187923138, 'text': "Hi Donivan, I'm sorry if you haven't received the service you deserve.

<text>Currently living in these apartments. My recommendation is to not live here. Their a1 bedroom apartments are more expensive than the house a few blocks away that my friend and his wife are renting. Had friends here that moved out because their contract went up in price about $200 after a year of living here. Towed my car 2 days after I got back from being on vacation. Granted I was gone for 4 weeks but they didn't call and since I carpooled to work this week I didn't notice the slip they placed on it the day before I got home. Apparently they had it towed beacause its what they consider "storing". Considering you have to pay a monthly fee and register every car that you want to park there I think they could have at least contacted me. The spa is nasty and despite being directly within view of the office they still let small children in it even though they posted an age limit. The lanscaping is more dirt than grass and plants. The apartment A/C are old and outdated. Luckily I required them to replace my A/C as it had broke twice in the three days before I signed the contract( of which was a hassle to convince them to do). Overall I would just look anywhere elsewhere. I look foward to the day I move out.</text>< pics>

DO NOT MOVE INTO THIS DISGUSTING PLACE.
MILITARY BEWARE
Not only are the apartments disgusting, but so are the people that work there. Here's my story.
We decided to choose this apartment because of the location and proximity to base and my school. FIRST of all, rent may say its 1300, but miscellaneous fees will jack that up to about 200 more. Have you ever heard of paying for maintenance or bug spraying around the apartments? Me neither. Apparently paying a ridiculous amount in rent for a 1 bedroom apartment in ghetto Escondido isn't enough. Our neighbors were harassed by the leasing office. If you have a motorcycle, more than likely it will get stolen. So our neighbors parked their bike on the back porch, in which they were harassed by the leasing office to move the bike because it "looked bad since they were trying to rent the apartment above them." UHHH, okay.
NEXT LOAD OF BS.
The wonderful "non-smoking" policy. This has not been the case ever since this place opened. It actually took place while we lived there! On day, the wonderful leasing office decided to change the whole entire place to non-smoking. So no, you cannot smoke on your patio, or near it. If you do, you get a big fat charge.
HERE'S THE FUNNY THING!!
When our neighbors with the bike moved out, a leasing office worker MOVED IN! How awesome! SPECIAL TREATMENT ALL THE WAY. I'm sure rent was even discounted. These wonderful people couldn't even follow their own policies and would smoke on the side of the apartment like no one would know! WAY TO REPRESENT. EVEN FUNNIER, almost ALL of the leasing office workers LIVE IN HIDDEN COVES.

HERES TO EVERYONE MILLITARY!
DO NOT MOVE IN HERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR MILITARY MEMBERS OR POLICIES. We received official orders 28 days before our move to across the country. I went in to give them our orders to terminate the lease AND gave a 30 day notice FEBRUARY 8TH. We HAD to move out MARCH 1st. So a 30 day notice would have taken us to have to pay up until MARCH 8TH, RIGHT??? WRONG. Apparently, prorating is nonexistent here and were were "responsible for an extra month". BULL. We went to a lawyer who advised us not to pay an extra month because we should have been charged just those extra 8 days. WELL, these people charged us the REMAINDER OF OUR LEASE because we supposedly "abandoned our apartment." Even though I had given a 30 day and our orders.

KEEP IN MIND: MILITARY CAN GET ORDERS TO DEPLOY AS EARLY AS 24 HOURS. THESE PEOPLE DO NOT CARE.

MY ADVICE: STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS HORRID PLACE. It is dirty, the people are full of poop, and rent is way too high to live in a dumpster.

I HOPE THE LEASING OFFICE SEES THIS.
YOU GUYS ARE ALL CONNECTED TO EACHOTHER AND ALL FEED THE SAME LINE OF BULL.
AN OVERALL 1.9 RATING MEANS YOU FIRST OF ALL HAVE AN ISSUE, AND SECOND OF ALL ARE GOING TO  LOSE YOUR MILITARY CUSTOMERS DUE TO THIS REVIEW.

Have a nice day everyone.< /review>

DO NOT RENT HERE
THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER OPTIONS, AND THIS SHOULDN'T BE ONE OF THEM.

Had to ask 5 different times to get the AC fixed because they didn't want to replace it. maintenance had the audacity to tell me that the heater was working just fine when it was blowing out cool air... Fast forward a few weeks to when we had heavy rains going on and we wind up getting tons of water stuck inside of the dry wall next to the AC. So only after I had a massive thing of water stuck in my wall which caused the dry wall itself to stick out to the point where it could have burst open did we get the AC replaced. For rent being what it is at this apartment, that's ridiculous.

In order to get the dry wall fixed we had to live with a torn up apartment that had flex piping running from our kitchen sink to the drenched portion of the wall. This took over 2 weeks to fix and we still had to pay full rent? of course we did, it's hidden coves!!

when I called to complain about the situation I was basically told that the place was habitable and that full rent would be required without recourse for me as a renter in any way shape or form. Save for this Yelp review but come on!

it gets better.  The gate is CONSISTENTLY BROKEN so please don't think for a second that you are really living in a gated community. You are not.

The gardening staff here takes just about all day to complete their work, not sure what to say about that except that it really adds to the feeling that we are being over charged for what adds up to be a trash heap of an apartment.

Inspect your wooden floors carefully if you decide to move forward (please don't move forward...)  as our ended up being wavy and warped. In fact the first week we moved in we had to have the repair guy come in to fix a lifted board in our kitchen. He put some wood glue underneath it and SMASHED IT WITH HIS FOOT A FEW TIMES before he told me "eh okay it's all done." What a hack job of a repair.

We also had to have our cast iron sink replaced, but only AFTER they insisted on scrubbing the rust away TWO DIFFERENT TIMES BEFORE ACCEPTING A REQUEST FOR A NEW SINK, HOW DISGUSTING AND CHEAP OF THEM.

Oh and most recently our keys stopped working in the lock for the front door. we had to have the whole lock replaced and the keys still didn't work. IT TOOK 3 TRIPS FOR THEM TO GET US WORKING KEYS TO OUR UNIT IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR LEASE!!

Was never told that there would be no security actually on site, which really stinks when the neighbor's are partying past mid-night and there's no recourse but to call a hotline number and wait for an hour or more for them to show up and look around. If that.

Our gate clickers needed to be replaced 3 different times before they would operate the gate without getting out of the car and walking up to it and even then, the gate is broken most of the time anyway. If you get lucky, it breaks in an open position - allowing you and ANYONE else to come and go freely. If you are unlucky it breaks when it's in the closed position and you have to drive all the way around to the other side of the complex to get back onto the road. Really a nice touch to starting the work day.

This place will charge you for ALL the "extras" like carport parking for $30 a month on top of your insanely high rent pricing.

It's a ghetto complex with a pretty paint job and a bunch of staff members that don't really give a hoot if you need anything.

They must think that there's always someone willing to move in but I'd bet a dollar that says this place goes under or is sold to new management the way things are going.

DO NOT MOVE HERE.
NOT WORTH IT.</Review>< Pics>

My significant other and I have lived here for 3 years. In the time that we have lived here it has been rather pleasant. The complex certainly has its pros and cons but overall I would say living here is good. Pros: Landscaping is always up to par and very accommodating to our pups. Maintenance crew is friendly, fast, and efficient.(Mario is our favorite). Amenities are always well kept (pool, laundry room, park etc.).The front office manager Jennifer Fitzmond (not sure about spelling) is compassionate and very understanding. The location is amazing with restaurants and stores all within walking distance. Cons: Rent goes up at least $80 with each lease renewal, kind of ridiculous if you ask me. Especially if your a loyal resident who pays rent on time and follows complex rules. Parking is a bit ridiculous its very limited and if you don't have a pass you WILL get towed.(but i understand that their needs to be rules) Also if you have your guests park on del dios there is no way to get inside the gate unless you walk all the way around to 9th ave and punch in the key code. They are pretty strict on hanging stuff over your blacony/deck. I've actually seen an off property manager push towels and blankets onto the ground as she walked pass each apartment that had stuff hanging over. A bit rude if you ask me. I understand it is to keep the ascetic appealing but if you go to the pool for the day or if your sweeping your floor and hang up stuff outside for a few hours i don't see the harm of it. Overall i'd say what has kept us here for 3 years is the great accommodations for our pets, the cleanliness of the complex and the location. We may consider moving if the rent continues to increase incessantly but would be a bit bummed if we had to.< /review>

<user>111515976121048317675<//user><text>You think if you renew a lease with someone and stay longer, u'd get a little discount or at least continue paying what you were originally paying. Well, not with this place apparently the longer you live here the more you pay for rent.

I came from the east coast where you get a good Sqft for your money, but it seems like you have to pay an outlandish price to get over a 1000sqft place.

And what is the deal with the stupid "Community Laundry Facilities" where i come from apartment complexes with community laundries are considered the ghetto. And last time i checked California is supposed to be up to date with the 21st century. Get washers and dryers in ALL of your apartments!!

Maintenance is horrible, half spanish half english speaking personal, that seem to ghetto rig everything.

And forget about having anything on your patio,  if its not "patio furniture" it doesn't belong.

Bottom line if you've lived here or are living here I am sorry for you and hopefully you find a way out soon. If you are thinking about living here please heed my warning reader and find somewhere else. I'd rather pay more money or live on the street then live here. Simply the worst place i've ever lived.<//text><rate>1< /rate>< username>

I lived there over a year and a half and it is the worst place ever. Do Not Move There!!!! They yell at you for putting anything and everything on your patios. We currently moved out and they told us that if we got our carpets cleaned professionally they wouldnt do it. and if we didnt they would get them cleaned. They are now charging me 500 dollars because they tore out the carpet without trying to clean them first and told me the stains wouldnt come out but yet they cant provided proof that they even tried first. they also told us that if we paint our walls they would only charge us 40 dollars to paint them back to white when we leave. I never painted my walls but was charged 109 dollars for paint? tell me how that one works. There is only one person in the leasing office who was helpful the rest of them were extremely rude and unhelpful. When ever problems were presented to them they took weeks to come fix them and half the time they never got fixed. Parking is terrible. there are not enough spots and people are always parking in them but yet we still have to pay. I suggest you look elsewhere before you live here!</Review>

Rodents in ceiling above bed on and off for FOUR MONTHS. I can't sleep through the night in my bedroom. Maintenance inept and management doesn't care. Stay clear of this place, no matter how nice it looks!<//Review>

This office has been such a blessing for me and my dad. I came in hardly able to stand and my dad had problems with his knees and posture. Dr. Kametz did a wonderful job explaining to us what was wrong and how it was going to get better. With every adjustment me an my dad have been feeling better. I was able to go back to work and my dad is able to walk with little to no pain. I want to thank the Doc and his staff for caring for us dearly.<//review>

<time>1623092083353< /time><text>When I first discovered about Gohl clinic, I was only skeptical about the distance to drive there. I still drive all the way from Lemon Grove to Carlsbad not to have only an adjustment, but to feel good coming out with the crew that actually cares about your well being. Working in my field of auto/truck repair I understand how critical it is to have a good relationship with people, on top of maintaining good posture and back/spinal health to be able to do this for years to come. This clinic does just that. Doc and his team DELIVER. You're not waiting in the office for your turn, you feel like you are in a family environment and chatting with the wonderful front desk crew. And to top off the good service, the actual practice itself speaks for its own. You come out feeling BETTER, and not aching like other some practices. Any newcomers will certainly feel the impressions in this review. Gohl Clinic you guys are all amazing!< /text></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Kametz was highly recommended by another chiropractor in Riverside County ( Dr. Ben) that follows the same chiropractic system he does. Over the last 20 years Dr. Ben has helped many of my family members with various issues. I was struggling with many health issues but I just couldn't find the time to drive up to Riverside County, or at least that was my excuse.  Dr. Ben would ask about me every time he saw my family. My family told him, it was too far for me and I simply could not commit. Dr. Ben told my Mom, she has no excuses because "the best chiropractor" is down the street from her house, his name is Dr.Kametz.

I got Dr. Kametz's contact details over 5 years ago and I continued to make excuses. I finally decided to come see him because I was tired of hearing "there is not much more we can do for you" from my doctors. Also, my Mother may have threatened me a few times, but that's besides the point.  My first visit with Dr. K was very informative and the main thing I took away from that visit was Dr. Kametz optimism and determination to help me.  He was very honest with me and made sure I understood this was only part of the equation and that he would help me get better but I had to put in the work too. I have been seeing Dr. K since November.  I came to him with a list of over 10 major issues. This list of symptoms was the same list my doctors  said, "we will need to learn to live with this".  They were wrong because that list has improved dramatically. Working with Dr. K has been a special journey and I continue to learn and do what I can to stay healthy. I am feeling so much better these days and I just wish I would have come see him 5 years ago.

Lastly, I cannot leave a review and not mention Dr.K's staff. I am an operations manager at heart and his staff is not only friendly but extremely efficient. I am convinced there is no better way to run a chiropractic office.<//Text>

<Text>I came in here a couple months back, after a car accident and from previous injuries on my back and I have to say, it was the best self care decision I took. Previous to coming in to this clinic, I was suffering not only from a recent car incident but from lower back issues I had been dealing with for the last 15 years. Honestly I had lost hope, and I didn’t even trust going with chiropractors anymore as I had already been a patient elsewhere before.

However, my sister been a patient here recommended to try this doctor at least once, as she would see how much excruciating pain I had been dealing with.
I couldn’t even sleep anymore, I was deali with a bad neck from the accident, 2 herniated disks on my lower back, sciatica was at its worst after 15 years of not treating it, a bad knee due to another accident years back and swollen feet.
I couldn’t last more than 2 hours on my feet at work anymore, until I decided that I either I really had to see a doctor for surgery or something. However I am so glad I came this doctor, because he truly gifted me health back. I have very few to lighter pain than I did for the past 15 years and I will continue to do maintenance with this clinic for years to come.
I even got back to the gym finally, and went from being overweight to a healthier number on the scale.
And part of this is thanks to Dr. kametz.

Also, the girls at the front desk are the best.
Always treat you with the best courtesy ever!

And I have to leave a high note, their appointments were super affordable compared to places I had been to before.

Definitely worth it, if you’re thinking of visiting a chiropractor please do your body a favor and visit this clinic!< /Text>< user_id>

I have been to a number of chiropractors and Dr. Kametz is by far the most effective (according to X-rays ) and I feel amazing! he's not one of the chiropractors who wants you to come in for unnecessary treatments just to get money out of you. They are very honest and truly love what they do. Their office staff Melissa and Bell are also extremely sweet.  Do yourself a favor and make an appointment with Gohl Clinic today!<//Text>

Went in to get looked at for some issues today. Did X-rays analysis and my first adjustment, and wow my whole experience was amazing. Melissa up front was super helpful and informative and Dr Kametz genuinely cares about his patients. He took his time to go over everything and get to know me and my background. After my first session I already feel amazing. I’d highly recommend Gohl Clinic to ANYONE.</text>

Dr.Kametz was so sweet, I went to him about once every week and he was so sincere and so informative. He would tell me exactly what he was going to do and why, he made me feel so comfortable during a time where I was in a lot of pain and quite frankly scared of chiropractic. He truly cares about his patients, you will always feel so great leaving his office. I know it’s taken me a long time to get to writing this review but I recommenced a friend today and it made me realize I needed to share what an incredible Dr. he is!< /text>

<Text>Seriously could not recommend Dr. K and his staff any more highly!!! He is kind, encouraging and gentle. I have seen 2 other chiropractors over the years  Who after months and many many dollars were unable to give me any relief. After my very first adjustment with Dr. K my numbing in my legs has been completely under control. Within the first 20 sessions of seeing him I had complete relief over years of battling digestive issues, menstrual issues and severe back pain. He is amazing! The girls at the front desk are pretty rad too!! 😉</Text>< pictures>

<review>I had a minor chest injury a few days ago. Since then I started to develop hard time breathing. The symptom of dyspnea progress from 2 hrs per day quickly to entire day of dyspnea over three days. What I feel is that I lost automatic breathing function and I have to force my self to take deep breath every other minute. But I also can't take in the air to the lung no matter how I force it and I am constantly hunger for air. I was very worried since my breathing function seems like very impaired. I almost thought about going to the emergency room.

Dr. Kametz adjusted me ( rib and thoracic spine) and the morning after that I feel 90% better with breathing.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

We found Dr. Kametz 5 years ago. My husband has had terrible back and neck pain for years. Dr. K was able to put the proper curvature back in my husband's neck and upper back and relieve his pain (we could see the change on the x-rays!). We have sent family members and friends to Dr. Kametz and everyone has had terrific results. Now, I am told by Kaiser I need a hip replacement. I finallly went to Dr. K and he found that my hip was rotated and tilted. After 3 months, Dr. K. has alleviated my hip pain, no surgery! Dr. Kametz is an incredibly talented, results-oriented Chiropractor! I can not recommend him highly enough. And his staff is super!!!<//text>

<Text>Been going to the Gohl clinic for about 9 months, and he has done an excellent job. When I first went to the Gohl clinic I was experiencing lots of back and neck pain. After being treated with regular visits I experienced a little bit of pain to no pain most of the time. I highly recommend chiropractic care  for those who need it and highly recommend the Gohl clinic.

highly recommend Dr. Kametz at Gohl Clinic of Chiropractic to anyone experiencing back pain, or looking for good chiropractic care! I have seen various Chiropractors in the area over the years, but Dr. Kametz is one of the most precise Chiropractors I have seen. When I came in as a new patient almost 3 years ago, I was barely able to sit comfortably and very eager to get adjusted, but before He ever did an adjustment they did a full set of x-rays of my spine, created a plan to get me pain free and back to normal and since then, he has consulted my x-rays at every appointment, and only makes gentle, but effective adjustments to only the affected areas, giving my body room to heal it self. I so appreciate his approach to spinal care, and I love that everyone in the office is SO kind and genuinely cares for me and my family<//review>

<Review>I've been seeing Dr kametz for over three months now. I came in with chronic back and neck pain that would flare up regularly making daily tasks difficult. The doctor's scientific and personal approach to chiropractic is nothing short of exceptional. The results for me have improved my life in so many ways. Being pain free again...most importantly! I also must say that the entire staff is so kind and always willing to go above and beyond to make my experience top notch. They even watch my baby too sometimes so i can get a treatment!</Review>< Response>

Dr. Kametz is an amazing and caring doctor! I have never been with a doctor that cares so much about his patients and his work. I had a car accident 6 years ago and was suffering from horrible migraines, and had to take Thyroid medication. After finishing my treatments with him, I have not had any migraines and don't take thyroid medication either. I am so happy to have meet a wonderful doctor! He has truly changed my life!!! His staff is pretty amazing as well! I highly recommend him!< /review>

Gohl Clinic and Dr Kametz are absolutely top knotch.  I've been to many chiropractors over my life and without a doubt Dr K is the most passionate, talented and committed I've witnessed.  Him and his staff offer a very warm atmosphere that makes you feel at home.

His care is unbeatable, he took an initial full-spine x-ray to view my area of complaint, and see how my entire body was impacted.  I had never received more gentle and specific adjustments and at the end of care he took another x-ray and there was visible improvement.

My headaches were gone after 2-3 visits and since I have seen him my overall health has dramatically improved (digestion, sleep, energy)

Couldn't recommend more highly!< /Text>

I was feeling better within the first visit, and progress was steady for the rest of the time.  The office had a warm and inviting atmosphere.  Everything about this treatment was positive, and worked.  Even with treatment being interrupted for business-travel, I was still able to experience relief of symptoms and their underlying issues.
I commend Dr. Kametz's work to anyone interested in recovery.<//Review>< pics>

I can’t say enough amazing things about Dr. Joe and his staff. I’m incredibly blessed to have gone through a truly life changing treatment with people who wholeheartedly care about someone’s wellbeing.
Being only 31yrs old, I have so much life ahead and things I want to do. Before Dr. Joe starting taking care of my adjustments, I was suffering from a handful of symptoms that were definitely limiting my life. Symptoms included: headaches often, neck pain, sinus infections, allergies, breathing/respiratory issues, severe lower back pain, unbalanced hormones, unbearable menstrual cycles, constant fatigue and digestive issues.
I’m beyond ecstatic to now honestly say every symptom has dramatically decreased or even some are non existent now.
I will definitely be continuing with Dr. Joe for maintenance, however I’m so happy to be able to live out my life pain free all due to Dr. Joe’s miracle adjustments, healthy eating and exercising.< /Review>

<pics>None</pics><Review>This place is awesome. The Dr. practices the Gonstead method of chiropractic care, which in my opinion is much superior to others or "regular" chiro care.
The staff is super nice and always have a smile on their faces. Dr. Joe is awesome. He's really good at what he does and goes the extra mile to examine you thoroughly and explain to you what's going on (wrong) and what the best treatment plan is and what results to expect.
I moved to the area and my previous Gonstead chiro recommended him as my new local back-and-neck-savior. The actual move put me in a really bad spot: lots of pain, constant discomfort. After the exam and initial couple of weeks of treatment, we did follow up x-ray to compare results. First of all: while taking the x-ray I clearly realized just how much better I was doing because I was standing there holding still: painless! The x-rays showed a huge difference, great improvement and my treatment frequency was lowered to a maintenance level. I continue to visit every couple of weeks to get the "kinks" out and I'm a happy customer - even though I never was given the feeling of being a customer or even a sick patient: I just went to a friend who did his best to make me better. And isn't that the best kind of Dr-patient relationship?<//Review><gmap_id>0x80dc7204837cef41:0x2b95e8f3db412f81</gmap_id><resp>None</resp><rating>5<//rating>< user_name>

I have been to many Chiropractors in my life but Dr Kametz is different.  He takes an xray and works on the areas that need fixing not just gives you a general "adjustment" like the others have done.  Plus my hot flashes have reduced which is huge!  I very much recommend him and his office staff is very nice.</Review>

<review>Dr. Kametz initially impressed me with how much he cares about chiropractic and me as a patient.  Even more so, how much he wanted me (and all of his patients) to understand how the body works and the importance of a healthy spine.

Over 2-3 months I felt better, slept better, and reduced injuries during my long runs.  When we did a follow up x-ray I could see visible improvements.

I now consider myself a patient for life.  Thanks Dr Kametz!.</review>< Pics>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I am not one to write reviews on google but I had to share my experience with Gohl Clinic of Chiropractic. It was honestly the best experience I have ever had with Chiropractic care! I came in primarily for my lower back pain and neck pain. I also had knee pain, shoulder aches, I couldn't stand for long periods of times and had irregular menstrual cycles but I didn't think chiropractic care would do anything to help with these problems. Within my first couple of adjustments my shoulder and knee  pain completely went away, my menstrual cramps dissappeared and my menstrual cycle went back to normal. I work in a chemistry lab and am constantly standing. By the end of the day, I would sit down and would have a hard time getting up. After 3 months of coming here, it was not difficult to stand back up and I didn't feel sore most of the time. I was skeptical at first but Dr. Kametz really does care about his patients. Not only does he help your body heal but he also makes sure to explain what chiropractic is and provides you with information to make sure you understand how and why you are having aches, pains or any other symptoms. He knows his stuff and is always happy to answer any questions you have. The office environment is also very welcoming and the front desk staff always greets you with a smile. Honestly, if you are skeptical but are having problems with any kind of pain, I definitley recommend at least coming to a consultation with Dr. Kametz. He will be honest with you because he is in this to help people. Trust me, if you are about to go into surgery come and talk to him to see if chiropractic is for you. It will save you the time and money of having to go through surgery. If it means you might not need to get surgery, it is worth giving chiropractic care a try!</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<rate>5< /rate><review>I began seeing Dr. Kametz when the pain in my lower back was so intense that I had difficulty sleeping, sitting and bending over. Although I had never been to a chiropractor and was not in favor of having various adjustments, I did finally make the decision to at least hear him out. I was immediately impressed with his knowledge and the way he described his practice and belief system. After having X-rays and seeing the degree of mis alignment that I had I decided to give it a try. It has been about 8 months that I have been under the care of Dr.Kametz and I truly cannot believe the improvement. I am not at 100%, more like 80% but that has made a world of difference to me.
For anyone who has never been to a chiropractor, been hesitant about visiting one, or having adjustments, you MUST at least make an appointment to see Dr. Kametz and listen to his treatment plan. Never in a million years did I ever think I would be treated by a chiropractor, but I am and am very thankful for it. I am an active 69 year old and now I can return to many of my activities without the constant pain!< /review><user_name>Patricia Campbell</user_name><date>1509295825971</date><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I have been seeing Dr. Kametz since he had an office in Encinitas (over 5 years ago). This is quite some time. At that time I had a pain in my shoulder that made it impossible for me to lift my arm over my head, much less tote my 25lb, 6-month-old around. He worked with me on a regular basis to get my movement back and eventually I was stronger than ever.
Of course with any person who is highly active physically and works a desk job, my activity and lack of it started to take its toll and when I started to have issues with my hips, I was thrilled to learn that the Golh Clinic had opened a location in Carlsbad - much closer to where I lived.
I went in and after X-rays, we started treatment. We were able to correct my issues enough for me to maintain my yoga and surfing with little to no pain. My back also started to look much better after consistent treatment.
Unfortunately, I also suffer from periodic tension headaches. Dr. Kametz has been amazing in my treatment for them. His office is highly accommodating and he's able to fix my issues. It's nothing short of a miracle (I know it's science, but at the time of pain it feels miraculous).
More recently, I was injured, Dr. Kametz got me in to help on very short notice and has worked with me to help my body heal. I'm feeling much better and my range of motion is really coming back.
Dr. Kametz has also seen my children from time to time when they have needed an adjustment due to injury or illness. There's never been any pressure, only a wwillingness to help and provide the best care.
I highly recommend Dr. Kametz and his professional staff.< /review>

<text>I've been seeing Dr. Kametz since he was at the Encinitas location. He is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about how the body works and chiropractic. When I first went to see him for my sciatica, I was skeptical about seeing chiros since I had not seen one before. He explained the specificity of his techniques and assured me that it wouldn't hurt (as I will initially concerned). I felt great after my first adjustment and am still seeing him today for my maintenance visits and feel better than ever! Thanks, doc!</text>< Resp>

The first time I went to see Dr. Kametz I had been suffering from cardiac arrhythmia for a while. With his first adjustment that arrhythmia went away and never came back. Dr. Kametz uses the Gonstead technique which involves no rotation or twisting. He is knowledgeable about healing and disease prevention, and his goal is to educate and help as many people as he can. He has helped me immensely improving my spinal health and disappearing side effects from misalignments.<//text>

I first met Dr. Kametz at the Carlsbad Marathon Expo January 18, 2014. I had been training pretty hard, but no harder than any other time I had run a half marathon. But I felt different I was having a hard time walking after a run to the point that I actually had a limp. So for about 10-days before the race I hadn't run. I couldn't. I was heartbroken at the expo, but still determined I would get up that next morning and attempt the race.

That's where Dr. Kametz comes in. I was supposed to run with my brother and sister. And my brother an advocate of Chiropractic (knowing I was a bit skeptical) suggested I at least talk to a Chiropractor.  I met Leigh and the Dr Kametz. He advised me not to run and to come see him early that next week.

As a runner I did the hardest thing a runner can do: I watched my brother and sister run from the sidelines.

I limped into Dr. Kametz's office where a smiling Leigh assured me that he would have me running again. Almost as if she was promising it.

The doctor took full size x-rays of my spine not just of the area I was complaining about. He went over them in detail and set up a plan to get me running again.

March 30, 2014 I ran in the Carlsbad 5000. Just 3 short months Leigh and Dr. Kametz came through with their promise.

I am 50-years old and stronger than ever.

If I could shout it from the mountain tops I would. Dr. Kametz is kind, compassionate, and a genius. He doesn't really like it when I say genius because he is so humble but he is!< /Text>

<Date>1616912788565</Date><text>Not a bad place to live. The mobile home park is a very quiet place. Not very kid-friendly even though there are many kids in this mobile home park. But all in all, it's a decent place, quiet neighbors, people mind to themselves. Decent management personnel a stickler for following the rules. But without rules there's anarchy, so I'll take the rules.<//text>< user_name>

There are a lot of kids now that play outside, nice to see that. They just re did the roads and the streets look a lot better. some people still don't clean up their houses, but maybe management can get them to clean up so our mobile home values go up and not have messy outside of the homes. I think that most of the people that have given poor ratings is because they don't like rules and like keeping homes messy. I love living here.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

If I could put a big fat "Zero" for the rating I would, but unfortunately it only gives the option for one star. If you want to feel like your living in a Concentration Camp, Come on down!!! They have zero to none consideration towards the tenants and your treated like cattle. I have many of examples, but just take my word for it.    P.S. you've been 4 Warned!!! Enter at your own discretion!!!<//review>

Did a story on a couple here once.  They were being commended, praised and nominated for a award  for their generosity, kindness and humanitarian efforts in which the results have had a positive impact on society  and all walks of life.
Brian and Angie live here.  They make it 5 Stars.  They are two of the most generous, kind, respectful, courteous, polite, humanitarians and positive influences this millennium has to offer.  They spend most of their time helping people that are "less fortunate", homeless, etc.  Some things they have been  known to help or provide are,  food, clothes, transportation, home repair and maintenance , auto repair, legal advice and research, life coaching and advice and in home care and assistance. These along with many other selfless acts of kindness are accomplished at their own expenses with no outside help.  This is pretty amazing being that paying their own bills month to month can be a struggle.  Brian once said,  "People are just trying to live.  Everybody deserves a chance to live.  Some forgot or don't know how to live. A nudge in the right direction, a small act of kindness or talking and listening to a person can be all a person needs.  Just saying "hello" to a person can keep a person living for another day".

These people are amazing, truly amazing.</Text>

Just recently had my wisdom teeth taken out and Dr. Shelton and her team took care of me so well! I had a really wonderful experience. I was super nervous at first, but she explained everything I would be feeling every step of the way and assured me everything was going well. Always a pleasant experience and lovely conversations every time I visit. Highly recommend!< /Text>

This is my first adult experience going to the dentist other then going to the one in the military. I called one day and the next day I had my first appointment. I must have been lucky because the follow ups were all that same week and everything was fixed that could be in one week. I think the staff was very friendly and welcoming. I walked in the door and they knew who I was right away mentioning my name making me feel even more welcomed. The only concern I had was that the prices are a little expensive but I think that’s how all dentist are. It’s a privilege not a need to have your teeth “perfect”, so insurance isn’t going to cover everything. Just be aware of that. I did get a lot of help from the financial lady. I told her I would have to save up for a couple of month, but she was able to help reduce my price with a discount that was going on, which ended that same day and due to it ending that day I had to get squeezed in to do an appointment that day. Due to her helping me reduce the price a little I was able to afford it faster. Everyone here is very friendly and I enjoyed coming here. I will continue coming here until I have to move again. Thank you so much!< /Text>

<Text>As someone who has had a life-time fear of the Dentist, Dr. Shelton has been an absolute game changer.  Unfortunately, avoiding the dentist did no favors to my teeth, and after spending years ignoring any type of check-up, I ended up with quite a few problems.  The last straw came after a wincing pain ruined what otherwise would have been a delicious meal.

I did some research, and settled on Polished General Dentistry after reading other reviews.  I was glad I did.  Everyone at Dr. Shelton's office is fantastic.  From the moment you walk into the office, you are made to feel at home.  The staff took extra care to make sure my nerves were calm, and made sure to listen to my complaints about previous experiences.

Besides the staff being a pleasure to have look after you, Dr. Shelton herself clearly cares about her profession.  She uses cutting edge technologies to give the best possible diagnoses, and then delivers (in what my case was bad news) with care.  Her treatment plan was extremely effective, and I never felt in pain or worried about my next visit (as I almost always did in the past).

If you're like me and are nervous to go to the dentist, or if you're just looking for a dentist that will provide you with the BEST possible technology, Dr. Shelton and co. can't be beaten.<//Text>< pics>

Overall, thorough dental work as of so far. Attention to detail was great. The Dentist and crew in back were great. The front counter needs some work, mistakes while submitting to insurance, lack of following up or answering questions numerous times. Asked for additional services and they didn’t  bother to follow up or get back to me and then argue about it! Further training  required.  If the front counter was better with less mistakes and errors 5 stars.

Same issue as the last few reviews, active military and they are in network but charge additional fees. Nothing is supposed to be an extra co pay here according to my insurance but yet they charge.</Review>

<review>I had my introductory appointment this morning at Polished General Dentistry and was totally satisfied. Searching for a new dentist has been challenging, but Dr Sheldon and her staff were awesome. I felt invitingly welcomed from beginning to end, leaving with a plan that will support my desire for a continued healthy, wholistic life ahead. They’ve got it covered with environment, technology and comforting expertise. I ask questions and they patiently answered all. Thank you team!<//review><userid>104038061701471528960< /userid>< date>

i was so impressed by how attentive they were and able to reassure me on certain things, the cleanliness of the facility etc.

HOWEVER the price is an absolute joke. they make you sign a waiver saying that you wave your right to bill your issuance… meaning they want you to pay 100% out of pocket. my insurance covered everything that they offered me and they lied and told me that it doesn’t. after a dozen lengthy phone calls with my insurance provider i was told that they should not be charging me cash but they were indeed charging me cash. i sobbed in their office because i thought i couldn’t afford the dental work being offered but i indeed could. they will say and do anything to get you to swipe your card. please please especially if you’re military DO NOT GO HERE.

i was absolutely let down 10000%.</Text>< Pics>

Dr. Shelton and Theresa are miracle workers! My gums were in very bad shape when I first came to them two years ago and now they are so much healthier and better than ever! I followed their advice, got the treatments done & I couldn’t be happier. They have the latest technology and all cleanings and procedures have been painless. They educate you on what is exactly going on with your gums and teeth so you are aware of what is wrong and what can be done to fix it. Their front office staff are fabulous as well! They are always friendly and remember details about me that I share with them. PGD is truly the best dental experience I’ve ever had!<//text>

Dr. Shelton and staff go above and beyond to make you comfortable. This includes the front office staff! They listen to your concerns, answer your questions and come up with solutions. Im not a fan of any kind of dental work, not even a cleaning, but I know I am in stellar hands at Polished Dentistry.< /Text>

Today I saw Pavlina for my 3 month cleaning. She was very thorough and efficient, it only took 45 minutes, I can’t believe it. I generally don’t walk out of a cleaning. Today they used the new airflow dental cleaning device for my dental cleaning. She started by using a colored agent to show me the areas where I was missing with my toothbrush and floss, which helped me visualize what I need to do different at home. This was new to me and really helpful. This was so eye opening for me, I felt like the constructive feedback is going to help me. I guess what I’m trying to say is that they actually showed me how to improve what I’m doing and to me that is the most caring thing. The new technology is called airflow (i think) that she used to clean my teeth was lots of water but no sensitivity, it was a really gentle dental cleaning. It follows the colored spots so she actually cleans the places that are dirty vs randomly cleaning.  And no gritty polishing. It was cool to see and feel that the hygienist pavlina likes the new technology.  I can’t emphasize enough how different this dental experience was at polished general dentistry in Carlsbad. I would highly recommend if you value high quality dental care and up to date technology for your medical care. Thanks Dr. Shelton and polished general dentistry< /review>

Excellent dental care. Absolutely PAINLESS. Everyone working there is genuine and they care about their patients. State of the art equipment and care. Broke a molar. Called for an appointment and they scheduled me quickly. In and out with a new crown in about 2 hours. Thanks!!<//Text>

This office is so amazing. From the moment I walked in to after I left I felt as though I was in a safe space. I've had quite a bit of trouble with dentist before so it's been awhile since I've been. These ladies have it down. I've seen 2 of the Dr's here, forgive me for not remembering their names, but BOTH are so sweet ❤ all the assistants as well as other staff were so kind and funny I kina felt like they were already friends. I've had a few pretty scary procedures done here and they were so gentle and professional I never needed 1 single Tylenol after my tooth extraction and graft or or my crown fitting and placing. I'd highly recommend Polished Dentistry to all my friends and anyone who asked. Seriously these ladies are THE BEST. Thank you to all of you and I'll see you soon 😊</Text>

< Review>
After reading multiple reviews on Yelp and Google, I wish I had done more research before booking an appointment. In April, I had an exam and cleaning with a different dentist that I paid out of pocket for because I did not have dental insurance at the time. I was told I had one cavity that needed to be filled. So I signed up for dental insurance and made an appointment with this office(the original dentist didn’t take my military insurance). I have never had any major dental issues. The longest I’ve gone without seeing a dentist is two years. I floss, I brush, I don’t smoke, I don’t drink, and I take care of myself and my teeth. I was blown away by the scare tactics and upsell that I experienced from this office. Apparently, in less than two months, from the time I had my last xrays/cleaning/exam with 1 cavity…according to Polished, I know have 10 cavities of varying degrees, gingivitis, gum disease, and need orthodontics done because my bite is destroying my teeth and I need Invisalign. WHAT?!?!?  In the span of two months this has all happened???  Let’s not forget the $35 toothpaste they said I needed. I did not meet or see Dr. Shelton, so I can’t speak for her or the long winded, condescending responses she provides to negative reviews. I can say this: an estimate of $5,000 worth of dental work when all I needed was a cavity filled???  Insanity. When I asked the office manager(or whoever does the financial packages) why there was such a discrepancy between what my previous dentist said and what I was told today was, “well most dentists are neglectful.”  WOW. Which was followed by another woman on staff telling me that my “hormones are responsible for my gum inflammation.”  WHAT?!?!  She wasn’t even a medical professional, she was an office staff member.  I was even contacted my another military spouse who had a similar bad experience with this office. Same scare tactics. Same hard sell. Same disappointment. Now o need to find a dentist for a 3rd opinion who won’t try to sell me on invasive procedures I don’t need.<//Review>

<username>TM F<//username><date>1627104982542< /date><rating>5<//rating><review>I have lived in 8 states.  Polished General Dentistry is the first location where a dentist informed me I had an anterior open bite.  I sat in the chair amazed and confused.  I thought to myself, “How come this is the first time I am hearing this?”  I had metal braces in the 1990’s, I wore my retainers for over 20 years, my teeth were “straight.”  I was completely unaware that my teeth were not structurally aligned properly inside of my mouth.  I was angry at past providers.  I quickly ignored my hurt feelings.  I decided to listen and act upon the evidence.  Dr. Shelton explained her findings using her expert knowledge and advanced dental imagery technologies.  The proof was in front of my face.  I had an “a ha” moment.  The anterior open bite was the sole reason I lost 2 teeth to root canals, had significant clenching, and receding gums all on my right side.  My teeth did not fit together properly.  The extreme and unnecessary pressure placed on my right side caused irreversible damage.  The left side only had two touch points and caused damage at those locations.  I needed to make a reasonable and healthy decision.  I agreed to receive Invisalign treatment that day.

Yes, Invisalign is expensive.  No, my insurance did not pay one cent.  My health is a priority.  The cost of Invisalign was an investment into my future health.  The costly dental treatments – “band-aids” – over the years far surpassed the price of Invisalign.  I selected Invisalign because I wanted in-person, hands-on expert support.  I paid for the benefit of having a local professional check and correct any matters.  Whenever I had a concern, I was seen either that same day or the very next day.

Treatment was long and worth each cent.  Progress occurred each week.  I now have healthy and structurally aligned teeth.  I completed my treatment last month.  I can already tell the difference.  I am not clenching my teeth, I chew correctly, and I enjoy meals more than ever before.

If a potential Invisalign patient asked me about my experience and requested advice, I would offer the following items:
•	The science is in front of your face  Invisalign treatment depends solely on you.  Like everything else in life, if you want quality results, you must put in quality work.  Stick to the script.
•	Develop healthy habits.  Keep a toothbrush, toothpaste, and floss in your lunchbox.  Use the timer on your phone or microwave to monitor eating times.  Replace each tray at the same time on the given scheduled day.  Purchase additional plastic retainer containers to protect your trays and keep them in useful areas – kitchen, bathroom, lunchbox.
•	Manage your own expectations.  There may be small and additional adjustments.  My adjustment treatment plan was longer than the original treatment plan.  Regardless, I was committed to the goal.
•	Stay aware.  Some buttons may fall off due to pressure.  As soon as you identify a missing button, contact the office.  Office staff were quick to help and make the situation right.
•	Maintain a positive attitude.  When I learned I needed adjustment treatment, I was upset at myself.  Did I do something wrong?  Know that Dr. Shelton can immediately tell if a patient is or is not following the script.  In my case, my teeth tracked exactly as projected.  I put in the required work.  The Invisalign professionals knew additional movement could occur.  No regrets!  I now see and experience the benefits of their dedication to achieve the very best results for my case.

I did not experience pain.  There was minimal to no discomfort each week when I replaced new trays.  As mentioned before, I previously wore metal braces.  As such, that experience served as my baseline comparison for pain and discomfort.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I had a wonderful experience! It has been awhile since I have visited a dentist due to a bad experience but I am so happy this place was recommended to me by a friend!  The staff went above and beyond to help me get in quickly when I needed. The care I have received has been phenomenal from the front staff, to the dental assistants, to Dr. Shelton. I have been welcomed with nothing but smiles.   I had to have a deep cleaning during which I started to feel a little anxious (ok a lot anxious) but my technician was beyond nice helping to try and distract me and make me comfortable. I was embarrassed by my inability to control my nervousness but everyone was very understanding and genuinely there to try to make me feel at ease. (Next time I will be taking a medication to help out, thank you Dr. Shelton) but After the procedure I can happily say that I can already feel an improvement in my teeth.  I will still be needing a lot more work done because I have neglected going for so long but for the first time in a long time I actually feel good about going in and I know  I will leave getting a healthier, happier smile. If you are looking for a great dentist with a caring and professional staff, this is the place for you!<//review>< Pics>

I was recommended to Dr. Shelton’s office through my insurance. I was having an issue with a tooth that had previous work on it from years ago. I called to make an appointment and was seen within the same week. I have been a patient there now for a couple of months now. I have general anxiety when it comes to going to the dentist. Dr. Shelton and her team always make sure that I am extremely comfortable, especially with me being pregnant. She is by far the best dentist I have ever had, she is very patient, she will explain everything she is doing, and doesn’t believe in rushing a procedure because she rather get it done correctly and fix whatever the issue is so you can be healthy. Both she and her staff are all very friendly and you will always be greeted with a smile and conversation. I would highly recommend her office!<//Text>

<review>I recently became a new patient at Polished Dentistry and had a great experience! Dr. Shelton is very thorough and addresses all current problems as well as any potential issues you could face in the future. I’m from a small town, but it felt as if I was back home when I went in for my appointments. Everyone was so nice and helped me feel at ease. I couldn’t ask for more! Thank you all for the work you do! :)< /review>< pictures>

Polished General Dentistry is amazing! Very professional and helpful. I was nervous going because I hadn’t been to the dentist in about 3 years and I new there was some damage... but they didn’t ever make me feel bad or embarrassed for my dental habits, they just helped me fix my problems! Highly recommend them for any patients old or young. I especially  loved my hygienist, Theresa! She did an amazing job.</Text>

Theresa was so thoughtful and professional as she performed my xrays and cleaning, and both Dr Shelton and Dr Gute are extremely knowledgeable and friendly! They even made sure my 4 year old was happy and entertained throughout the duration of my appointment.
The front desk staff has been exceptionally kind, friendly and professional each time I have interacted with them. I would highly recommend Polished Dentistry, especially if you’re seeking a holistic approach.< /Review><Rate>5<//Rate>< Time>

I was having issues with my bite that it was causing pain to chew food. I was able to be seen right away each visit and my bite was adjusted so I can finally chew and no additional work needed on my teeth! Staff is super friendly and welcoming.< /Review>

<Review>I’ve had nothing but great experiences at Polished Dental! The staff is amazing and Dr. Shelton is transparent and thorough through the entire process. They use new technology which makes the visits a lot smoother and less painful. As someone who avoided the dentist for over two years before coming here, I highly recommend them to anyone who feels uneasy when it comes to their dental needs. Even if you don’t, these ladies will surely make you smile! Thanks PGD!</Review>< time>

Amazing from the moment I walked in. Not a huge fan of the dentist, but went here for a crown! Front of office staff really nice and helpful and their Covid19 protocols are on point, temperature checks and detailed waivers to fill in.

You can tell the office is extremely modern to other dental practices I’ve been too and my crown feels and looks like a new tooth. Dr Shelton was great accompanied by her lovely staff.

Recommend. Thanks guys<//text>

Broke a tooth yesterday day they were so great and gracious. It’s my Birthday today and have a party tonight they helped me out and made me look better than before I broke the tooth.

Do yourself a favor — fantastic staff, absolutely painless treatment and helped put together a long term plan. Check them out.

Megan Shelton is amazing she is the dentist here truly the best.</text>

I truly felt taken care of here. They addressed my needs instead of my wants and I am so happy with that. I know they are serious about healthy teeth and gums. And the staff was amazing!!! They loved on my 3 kids for more than 2 hours while I was getting major work done and I am so grateful especially during COVID. You can't find any babysitters during this time and we're new in town. So high-five to the crew! Love them, I will be back for follow-ups and maintenance work for sure! Thanks Polished Dentistry for making me feel loved by you!<//Review>

Dr. Shelton is one of the best dentists I have ever had. She and her staff take the typically unpleasant experience of visiting the dentist and flip it on its head - going to the dentist is no longer like pulling teeth, even when it literally is. I highly recommend her practice, she is truly concerned about your dental care and how it impacts your whole health. And her office is so comfortable, expertly cleaned and sanitized, especially during the COVID pandemic. Thanks for caring for my dental health Dr Shelton!</Review>

<Text>I had my teeth cleaning recently and just as with every time I go, the team at Polished Dentistry were courteous, professional and friendly. From the moment I walked in I was greeted with a smile and by name.

My dental hygienist, Leah is awesome. She knows I travel and am not as diligent as I should be with caring for my teeth. She explained to me (again) how important it is to stay consistent my regimen and was able to show photos of how my teeth have improved over the past year. This is powerful and gratifying. What I like most about Leah is her positive and firm feedback along with providing pertinent information.

I also saw Dr. Ann during my visit. This was my first time seeing her as Dr. Shelton was out that day. I appreciated Dr. Ann’s thorough approach and direct (yet positive) reinforcement of my dental hygiene as well as responses to my questions.

All in all while going to the dentist isn’t classified as “fun”, this office and staff make it as enjoyable and positive an experience as I have ever had.

Thank you.< /Text>< gmap_id>

I haven’t been to the dentist since I was discharged from the military in 2012 and last received dental work in 2011.  I have been avoiding going but soooo happy I did!! I was so nervous but the service was nothing short of amazing. My dental hygienist Teresa( hope I spelled it right) was so kind, patient and knowledgeable. She answered all my questions and made sure I felt comfortable. Dr. Shelton was amazing as well. She listened, gave sound advice and recommendations. I trust you all 100% to get me where I’ve needed to be these past almost 10 years. I can’t forget the front desk staff. They were kind and made sure I understood all charges. I truly appreciate it. Thanks again!! See you soon. Jess.</text>

I have been a patient/customer of Polished Dentistry for several years.  The entire staff is always upbeat and courteous.  Very professional.  Dr. Shelton is extremely talented and has available the very latest in dental equipment.  She is also a wonderful person and takes the greatest care with all the procedures (and I have had many).  I highly recommend Polished Denistry to anyone looking for great dental work.< /Review>

<text>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! From the moment I walked in the door, Amy at the front desk stood up to shake my hand and greet me and introduce me to her colleague. She was so kind and set the tone for the rest of my appointment. The office itself is so presentable and comfortable with the comfiest chairs & Christmas decor. My hygienist (I wish I could remember her name) was amazing!! She was thorough, detailed, explained everything she was doing and was so sweet. The dentist (I think Anna did my exam) was also so friendly & thorough. After the exam, my hygienist introduced me to Liz to go over next steps, insurance, and costs. She was so kind and explained everything to me and made the uncomfortable conversation of prices so easy. I've never had a bad experience with my previous dentists, but now that I've gone here I don't think any place else will ever measure up! It is obvious the owner & ALL staff go above & beyond in every detail, big and small! This place feels like a dental resort!< /text>< user_id>

Theresa was great in my exam and explaining what she saw and Dr Anna dyne rest of the exam and explaining the approach she felt would best suit my needs. Both women were very informative and kind. The dental chairs are somehow? The most comfortable chairs I’ve ever been in at a dentist office. The tv on the ceiling was nice too. I met Dr Shelton at the end, she was very friendly and able to accommodate my follow up appointment needs. The office is beautifully decorated and I appreciated the extra steps they took with COVID outbreak occurring. I was very pleased and impressed with the latest dental techniques and tools and looking forward to getting the work taken care of.<//Review>< Pics>

They talk you through what they are doing the whole time and make sure you are comfortable 😊 I would recommend this office to everyone!! Thank you guys for being such a great dental office!<//review>

This is the best dental care I've ever received! They are masters at dentistry and have state of the art equipment enabling them to make each appt a one stop visit!  No need to return for crowns normally outsourced to distant labs since this is a total in-house procedure.

<Rating>2</Rating><text>The staff was really friendly and answered any questions I had.
However, I did not like having over 21 x-rays taken in one sitting, just because I was a new patient.  In my opinion, I would rather have the doctor look at my teeth first, and use their knowledge and experience, to determine if any x-rays were needed.  Instead the doctor looked at my teeth, after all the x-rays had been been taken and my teeth were cleaned.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1592087041277, 'text': 'Hi Nancy,\n\nThank you for sharing your concerns about xrays. I did not have the opportunity to meet you, and I’m not surprised that the team was friendly, they are great!   I’ve put together some info for you and others to understand the necessity and safety surrounding dental X-rays.\n\nIt’s important for us as your dental professional to have a comprehensive picture of all your teeth because gum disease and cavities don’t often cause pain in the beginning stages, which is why detecting them with X-rays is imperative. Cavities, abscesses, tumors, and periodontal disease can not be detected by visualization alone.\n\nWe take 18 x-rays for new patients, most of the time that gives the doctors visualization of every tooth and root. To not take these xrays is neglectful. We refuse to lower our standards to protect you from disease.\n\nRest assured there are many other forms of radiation in life that are far worse than dental X-rays. Many you are probably completely unaware of. The maximum annual dose permitted for U.S. radiation workers is 50.0 mSv. To set the bar, let’s go ahead and reveal the dosage of the most commonly taken X-rays at your routine cleaning appointment – bitewings. The dosage of 4 bitewing radiographs taken with d-speed film (in other words not digital) is 0.038 mSv. If those bitewings are taken digitally, that dosage reduces to 0.02 mSv. Since we tooth 18 xrays that is 0.09mSv.\n\nThe average radiation in the U.S. from natural sources on an annual basis comes in at a dosage of 3.0 mSv.\nA chest X-ray has a dosage of 0.10 mSv.\nRadon in the average U.S. home on an annual basis is a dosage of 2.28 mSv.\nThe annual dose received by food and water (potassium) is a dosage of 0.4 mSv.\nA cross-country flight from New York to Los Angeles comes with a dosage of 0.04 mSv.\n\nRadiation comes in all shapes and forms, not just from X-ray images. You receive more radiation from a single flight across the country than with bitewing radiographs at your dental appointment! However, no one thinks twice when booking their vacation and boarding that plane. If your dental professional needs X-rays, please be comforted that he/she is not only highly educated in making the decision, but is doing so for a legitimate reason – your health. To see is to know.  Not to see is to guess! And we won’t guess when it comes to your oral health.\n\nKindly,\nDr. Megan Shelton & Dr. Anna Gute'}< /Resp>< gmapID>

I've been coming here since it switched over from the previous dentistry.  It's a fantastic place to get your teeth taken care of.  Everyone who works there is very nice and knows their stuff.  Most of the time I'm there for cleanings and check-ups, but recently also had a crown put in.  The procedure was smooth and mostly painless :)  The technology used by the office is really great too.  The latest tech, I believe, makes the dentist visits much better.< /text>

<Text>I have not been to the dentist in years (I do not recommend this!) and I could not have had a better experience. I really appreciated the kindness, thorough explanations, and gentle exam. I would highly recommend this practice to anyone seeking a new dentist.

Update: I have been seeing Dr. Shelton for a year now and I highly recommend her practice and her staff to anyone who feels anxious about the dentist. I avoided the dentist for years because of a bad experience and I am now dealing with the repercussions. Dr. Shelton detailed a very clear treatment plan for me and explained everything thoroughly and clearly. Even though I still feel anxious before every appointment, I am always greeted with smiles and care. My anxiety melts away as I sit in the chair and the hygienists and/or Dr. Shelton explain what they are doing as they go. I leave feeling grateful and relieved. If you are someone who feels anxious about the dentist, I highly recommend giving Polished General Dentistry a try!</Text></record>

I also just had a teeth cleaning with their new method.  I liked it better than the old one because there’s no grit involved and they aren’t picking at the teeth with a metal rod.  There was a lot of water used but it was better and my teeth look great!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<text>An especially great experience considering the COVID outbreak. It was obvious the team has an established a process for keeping clean. Not to mention Dr. Shelton was incredibly polite, thorough and professional but so easy to talk to. They got me in on a Friday afternoon when I had called the day before. And since I am leaving town, they even squeezed me in last minute for the following week. Everything about the bi-annual check up went wonderful, even the student dental assistant I had was communicative and did a great job. Sad I’m moving away because this is definitely the kind of dentist’s office that I’d love to keep coming back to. Oh and LOVED the ceiling tv’s... going to the dentist is something that has always been enjoyable for me but the cute animal videos made it even better.<//text>< UserId.>

<Text>I had originally gone here because of pain in my gums and it turned out that I had a mouth full of cavities that required a few step process to correct. During my first appt to correct the mess I had gotten my wisdom teeth out which wasn’t the best experience I must say. I’m very sensitive to pain and just have an overall anxiety with getting procedures but Dr. Shelton and her staff were great. Everyone is super friendly, they’re knowledgeable, and they don’t beat around the bush. I was especially impressed with how compassionate Dr. Shelton was after the removal of my wisdom teeth. She could have easily just let me leave the office and spoken with me during my next appointment but she took the time to call and check on me. That right there is the kind of dentist and customer service everyone should receive. I highly recommend this dentist office if you want to properly and respectfully be taken care of.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1590124094444, 'text': 'Thank you Kayla!

I really love this dentist and her office staff.  I always leave laughing and happy which is very unusual after a visit to a dentist.  She uses all of the newest technology and knows the latest techniques.  She really wants her patients to feel relaxed and not to feel any pain.  She gently rubs your checks when giving shots and this seems to work.  I was concerned and worried when I needed a crown replaced and it didn’t hurt at all.  I was very impressed.</text>

Dr. Shelton is super friendly and very knowledgable. She is always willing to explain the treatments and options. The office is welcoming and staff is always helpful.

< Review>
A few weeks ago I got onto Polished Dentistry’s website to book an appointment. It was Saturday after hours, and assumed I wouldn’t hear from anyone until Monday. Instead, I received a text from Dr. Shelton asking about my situation. After my explanation, she called in a prescription for a treatment of antibiotics. It was such a relief and comfort to have such unexpected, personalized care. I was unsure if my week away on a trip would have to be canceled and was assured antibiotics were enough for the time being. Dr. Shelton checked back in with me via text to make sure all was well.

Today I had my first appointment. Amber in the front office was warm, friendly and knowledgeable. I signed up for an in-house payment plan that works perfectly for my budget. This alleviated payment concerns for all my dental health needs.

Dr. Shelton was also so pleasant and thorough in her explanation of my dental health situation and the options available. Her manner and professionalism before and after I met her, has won my trust.

I highly recommend this office for your dental needs!<//Review>

<text>I have had a lot of dental work over the years and I have seen many different dentists and specialists. I have been very pleased with Dr Shelton and all of her staff. Everyone is very friendly and gentle. Dental procedures that I thought were torture in the past are pretty easy and relatively painless at Polished Dental. I also love that they have the technology and equipment to build crowns in the office so you don’t have to come back for a 2nd appointment. I would definitely recommend Polished Dental to family and friends.< /text>< Rate>

Smooth and fast appointment, everyone there was amazing and super friendly. They comforted my son when he was crying while I got my cleaning done, they even played with him with his cars to keep him entertained while I got my X-rays done.

To share with you and other google users, we are not using gloves based on the information we have about gloves creating cross contamination when not properly used and that it was released the virus doesn’t live on surfaces. Great concerns! Maskswe debates long and he’d about but considering we have multiple patients with hearing loss, it was hard for the front team members to communicate effectively with masks on over the phone and in person, we had a gal last week who lip reads! Most of our patients are wearing masks so that they can effectively understand us when we speak, informed consent is part of our process and we agreed as a team to be able to schedule and answer questions, even for those with disabilities, that not wearing a mask was better for us. We prescribe each team member each day with thermometer, pulse oximetry, and questionnaire also. As for the thermometer they are sterilized with medical grade disinfectants and bagged after cleaning our hands. We tried the touch less and the temps were so inconsistent it defeated the purpose of taking each individuals temperature. Thank you for sharing your views as we have more extensive training in infection control than our patients and may have a myopic view so are grateful to be able to share with you the science we are privileged to, next time you have a question I am available to answer it.

I did find it a bit unsettling that front office staff were not wearing masks or gloves.  It doesn't inspire confidence.  When I had my temp taken, I was told I did not have to take the thermometer out of the plastic sleeve--after it was handed to me with bare hands.  Ditto for paperwork protecting PGD from any liability for contracting Covid19 in the office.<//text>< rate>

I believe I have found my forever dentist! Going to the dentist for me is always a scary experience but not anymore! Dr. Shelton and her staff were absolutely amazing and made me feel like royalty. Dr. Shelton was very thorough and took the time to go over all of my x-rays and photos with me to make sure that I understood what was going on. I can’t thank everyone at Polished enough. I am a patient for life!</review>

<text>I trust Dr. Shelton with my teeth needs. The office is very clean and the staff is really nice. I  had to have a lot of work done with in the last year, resulting in spending lots of money. The only thing I would change is the pushing of purchasing of more products. At my last cleaning I was very happy that my teeth were finally healthy again, but that changed when the hygienist pushed me purchasing an alignment product. I would just like to be able come in and walk out only paying what my insurance doesn’t cover for that visit.< /text>< GmapID>

I've always dreaded going to the dentist, but the whole staff at Dr. Sheldon's office is amazing. They are extremely friendly and make me feel much more at ease.  Even when work needs to be done, they take the time to explain the reasons for the needed treatment plan. It has made going to the dentist much less stressful.</Review>

<text>I went in for two issues and instead they did a total work up and concluded I needed $10,000 worth of dental work. I am so frustrated and unhappy with the way the exam went. I had two urgent issues and instead of focusing on that or really even covering it they ran a million x-days, scans, etc. If you ever go here and need something specific done make sure at the beginning of the appointment to reiterate it. I thought it would be clear based off of my call and what I wrote in for the reason for appointment, but they have their own agenda.< /text>< rating>

We were very thorough to explain what is the source of the problem that bothered you.  It would be unprofessional and neglectful not to inform you about the source of the issue you came to see us for.  I answered all of your questions and explained how we can treat the two  problems you presented with. You’ve been explained that in order to address the source of the problem and prevent signs from recurring that you need to take serious actions for your oral health. You asked what is the cost for the whole treatment including treatment for the root cause and our business team member presented you an estimate. You left the office abruptly after seeing the estimate without even letting us finish to guide you through your treatment plan.\n\nNikki, I understand that you are very sad and shocked after you learned things you were not aware of about your oral health condition. It is our duty to inform you and give treatment options. You had no obligation to accept treatment of $10,000 but I have moral and ethical obligation to inform you of the disease you have and the treatment since you requested it. If you would like to return to let us complete the treatment plan and estimate for you we will be happy to serve you.\n\nDr. Anna Gute'}<//response>

Loved my experience with Dr. Shelton - I am considering getting veneers and I have now been to her twice, once for a deep cleaning/being fit for a mold and now this second time to get the temporary ones put on to see if I'd like it. She took so much time with me to make sure that I liked what she was doing and listened to what I wanted...she's made the process really easy for me and made me feel comfortable every step of the way. Plus her staff is great and office is so cute! Thanks Dr. Shelton!< /review>

<Review>Extraordinary Comfort, Exceptional Care.

Dr. Shelton and her staff redefined what going to the dentist means for me.  I used to get my standard cleanings and a filling here and there-going through the motions and not too fond of the dentist-but after visiting Polished General Dentistry and seeing Dr. Shelton, I was pleasantly surprised and actually enjoyed my visit.  Dr. Shelton was honest, kind, and gentle, and she made me feel right at home.  She really took the time to get to know me and educate me without reprimanding my flossing habit(or lack thereof).  I would highly recommend anyone looking for a refreshing dental experience to visit Dr. Shelton and Polished General Dentistry.</Review><GmapID>0x80dc722922a77a51:0xde4f127cccb8db3c< /GmapID><time>1487129157193</time></record></dataset><record>

Dr Shelton is super great. She's a perfectionist at what she does. She always makes sure to keep you comfortable and does her absolute best to provide you with dental work with no pain. Super friendly staff, and all around great dentist office. I've been to this dentist about 10 separate times, and my experience was always a pleasant one.  For those who don't like doctors/dentists who run late, Polished General Dentistry is your place.<//Text>

Beautiful office and friendly staff however I felt like were trying to upsell me on various treatments.  I had just seen my regular dentist in May and now I need not just regular cleaning but I need a treatment for gum disease that my insurance doesn’t cover.  On top of that, I have 3 fillings that they say are cracked band need to be refilled became of age.  Ok, maybe but recommending porcelain fillings when my insurance covers 80% of regular fillings seems suspect.  The final feeling of uneasy came when I could hear other patients being told similar things about their mouths.  With a total bill of over $1500 to give me exactly what I have, I’ll try extra hard on teeth maintenance and and seek out another opinion.< /review>
<pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1572876769055, 'text': 'Hi Stacy. We pride ourselves on using clinical presentation, the most recent research, and evidence based dentistry for developing objective treatment plans. Our office has invested in technology for objective diagnostics and spared nothing on education with the incredible Kois center in Seattle. Either your previous dentist didn’t operate by these standards of care or your health has changed significantly. My team and I do not diagnose your pocket book or allow insurance to influence the quality of care we provide. Your insurance covers 80% of a silver filling like most peoples, that doesn’t make it the right way to treat a tooth or a patient.  Porcelain fillings shrink less, have less leakage, and strengthen teeth while preserving enamel... the contrary can be said about amalgam. You deserve better and we as an office have chosen to always provide better through our extensive education and experience.  Decay is the most common bacterial disease in America among children and periodontal disease affects over 68% of people, it’s no wonder it’s a common discussion in our practice and should be in every practice. Negligence is something we refuse to partake in. Education for ourselves and shared to our patients is pivotal in helping decrease the epidemic of oral disease across America and reducing systemic bioburden.  This is my profession and my passion and I have great pride that my team is informed beyond that of most teams.  It is a challenging career to try to educate patients on the risks and dangers of not treating their diseases, we apologize for failing you in not establishing the importance and value of your medical condition and the dental treatment needed to reduce the problem.  We hope you find a practice that can provide you with the philosophy you are seeking and wish you a safe health journey.\n\nKeep smiling and keep flossing,\nDr. Megan Shelton'}< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>A good dentist is hard to find - you found one.

Dr. shelton is a good and honest dentist. Not one to try and sell you all the cosmetic bells and whistles though if your interested she is happy to go over those. She has always worked with me, my poor teeth and budget to keep me in good dental health. I mean what more can you say about a Dentist that will come out to the parking lot in the rain (I'm not kidding) to hand me back my phone that got left in the chair before I drove off. Above and beyond. Describes Dr. Shelton.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I am thrilled to be a patient of Dr. Shelton! Her knowledge is extremely impressive and their facility is the cleanest I have ever seen. Dr. Shelton is extremely thorough with the examination. She is precise, gentle, and made my procedure painless. She explains treatments and techniques with language I can understand. Excellent staff and a relaxing, esthetically pleasing environment. So happy I found her!<//review>

Quoted me a price for dental work and I agreed so I had the work done. Over a year later they call me and state the quote was wrong and my insurance will not pay 600 of it. So all of a sudden I have to pay for something I didn't agree to. They are theives.<//text>

{'time': 1590343514994, 'text': 'Hi Marco,\nI understand your frustration is regarding money. You were quoted a fee and your insurance didn’t pay their part and claimed there was a waiting period and then said there wasn’t. Our paperwork clearly states any responsibility of a balance is the patient’s, even in the event that your insurance does not pay on your behalf. That does not make us crooks, that makes your insurance crooks and this review misrepresents you and my business. You also told us in August 2019 via phone you would come by to pay your balance. We called you multiple times for two years regarding your balance and even offered you payment plans. We never charged you a late fee either. Please remove this dishonest review and consider how your reviews affect locally owned small businesses that employ people during these tough times. I wish you health and happiness moving forward.'}< /Response>

<text>I recently moved here and knew I was going to need work done after not coming in for a long time. I've had terrible painful experiences in the best, and finding a new dentist was nerve-wrecking. Dr. Shelton and her staff did a great job of walking through what needed to be done with me, and making recommendations for what I could do to keep my teeth healthy. Procedures were painless, and it feels like she really cared about doing what was best for me. Would highly recommend. I'm actually looking forward to my next cleaning, which I never have before.</text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<review>Everyone here is so friendly. I always feel super taken care of. And after every visit they give you a nice quality care package of the following: electric toothbrush replacement (if you ask),  toothbrush, chapstick, and floss. You know how expensive electric toothbrushes are, this is super appreciated.

The front desk ladies are amazing, they answer all my questions and hear out all my concerns if I have any.

THEY ACCEPT CARE CREDIT.
Which is awesome cuz I can finance anything I get done here and boost my credit as well.

They also have an in house x-ray machine, iTero 3D scanner, and porcelain crown making machine. They can do a lot of procedures in house, which is really time saving and convenient for me.

I have Guardian insurance and they definitely accept that.

After a lifetime of having dental care through MediCal, this place is a breath of fresh air. I've never had such great, understanding, and thorough dental care.

Dr. Shelton is fantastic, kind, welcoming, understanding, and an all around positive entity who really made me feel reassured about every procedure (I've had a wisdom tooth extraction and crown done here, and it was painless physically and insurance-ly).  Speaking of insurance, Amanda from insurance was very patient and thorough whenever I would ask what each itemized thing on my receipt meant. And if there was anything she wasn't sure about, she would go above and beyond to get me an answer quickly. Which I really appreciated.

I definitely plan to get Invisalign here. I probably will update this review with a before/after. But for now, with all my heart I can confidently say I would trust Polished General Dentistry with all my Dental care needs, and absolutely recommend them if your insurance is accepted here!

Everyone here is amazing and I haven't had a single unpleasant interaction with any of the staff.

Big thank you to Dr. Gute and Amber for taking care of me during my cleaning today.< /review>< Pictures>

Your experience and knowledge of the dental industry is second to none.

Being a regular patient to Dr. Megan (DMD) and having frequent hygiene appointments with Leah (RDH) - I quickly realized how amazing they both really are. In fact, this whole office is a little gem hidden in the South Coast of California.

Dr. Megan is increadibly skilled in modern dental technologies and treatments. She knows dental materials inside out and makes sure to implement digital technology to her work flow - thus helping patients, like myself - get the world-class dentistry in a fast and easy fashion, here in SoCal. Besides the superb knowledge and skills - Dr. Megan shows unparalleled integrity, honesty and good work ethic - which are rare qualities and quite difficult to find today.

If you are a new patient or looking for a new dentist - the Polished General Dentiatry with Dr. Megan (and Dr. Anna -- new clinical addition) will be your best choice. These doctors are skilled, fast, reliable, fun - simply speaking - AMAZING.<//review>< Gmap_id>

<review>I can't say enough positive things about Dr. Shelton and her staff!  They have helped my husband and I tremendously with all our dental cares over the last few years.  Dr. Shelton never tries to sell you something you don't need, she takes the time to tell you what she recommends, and why, but without any pressure.   Go see Dr. Shelton and her staff.  You will NOT be disappointed!<//review><user>106413103963817028778</user>< Rating>

I just moved to Carlsbad and decided to try them since they were close to my house...3 weeks later, I'm still waiting for approval for my insurance...I finally called my insurance provider, they told me they were waiting on paperwork from the dental office to process....all this time they were blaming my insurance company...needless to say I'm not coming back here...what a total waste of time!!!!< /Review>

<response>{'time': 1584623506881, 'text': 'Bob, We strive to deliver evidence and science based care with a compassionate approach. I listened to your desires and went against what I know to help you based on what you wanted.  My responsibility is to diagnose your disease based on signs, symptoms, and data and then present you with a treatment. Your diagnosis and treatment have no relation to your insurance or pocket books. If a patient goes against doctors recommendations, it is respected but the patient must assume the consequence and that outcomes and experiences are compromised, as they were in this instance.\n\nYour review is inaccurate and misleading. I explained this to you when we communicated via phone... We spoke with your insurance 8 times during the two weeks, all conversations were documented. Your preauthorization was faxed five times. The last conversation they indicated they don’t recognize you as a client.  This review is unfair and false, February 24 to March 9 is two weeks. My team and I told you a preauthorization was not recommended because you would be instilling your insurance to dictate your treatment and the timeline of your treatment.  They went above and beyond, as did I, to assist you with your needs.\n\nWe hope you can find a provider that can meet your needs and help you keep smiling .'}</response>< gmap_id>

I am SO thankful to have found dr Shelton in my life! I have had way to many sales-ishh dental experiences and we all know how unpleasant and annoying that is. Dr. Shelton is so rad, and I genuinely feel she has the best, most conservative approach to diagnosing and treating, very straight to the point. I love that she pulled up my images and went over the diagnosing and treatment with me so I really had no questions I knew exactly what was going on!<//text>

I LOVE Elena’s crepes. There’s a wide variety of both sweet and savory flavors and they’re all delicious. Elena herself is also lovely. I live in San Diego now but still drive up every once in a while for a treat, because they’re that good. I highly recommend!</text>

<rate>5</rate><review>These crepes are amazing! The butter used is just the perfect touch. Didn't get to photo the ham & cheese, but that was a favorite of ours. Of course, I love nutella, reminded me our trip to France and Belgium. The owners are the best! Friendly and really have a passion for their crepes! We have wanted to try it for so long, so glad we made it in today. We'll definitely be back!<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>If you enjoyed this review please give it a like. Elena's crepes is a quaint artsy fun spot located at the entrance of Oceansides artist alley. This is a decadent treat, I had the ham and cheese crepe and my Mother in law enjoyed her egg salad crepe. The crepes are delicate and light and scrumptious, almost sinful.
Elana and her husband Hassan have been serving up scrumptious crepes in Oceanside for four years. Their artwork is proudly displayed on the walls. You owe it to yourself, treat yourself to a crepe, you deserve it.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXkSGf0awIo4vhTY-VbgjcCUDQXvN0Ipq-NZ52=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJPRw8dgbdNOuH9zYA1HDkK_dAIOZCLfVWIVjD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1mpfZJOyn9BfSrncDKHxXSQCvxUMMePgjI32I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwX73ZU3Ii0SS2jnMIjVysB6T-NyRo5UyBsVzv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9VDRVB_L_jxPngwAEP3CYpkGLVQU2iyLW-xzs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4kcDjgivug5DiKT-TBj7DbHLDm_ikzJ0Uz-Ya=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGDjQom78h5Bu1CaKHq1WuCUoJOa6ros6GYMGG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpJDz9OLpt-7IpfiuXGJNHgZxO8B53uj4eHfcp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNI6BQXRUUCETARYDomqRKIjqDin42Qfn3YJgFR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMb5HpWK5a642TS4Y1AVmPn2zJrxuLw18bkvKln=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhra62owDRAF5LfWVKgOT0XbFNtzIF01IU83MO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

<review>I loved everything about Elena’s.  The crepes were perfection and the coffee was fantastic. And Elena herself was a doll! Love, love, love. I will be coming back for sure!!

The shop was also following COVID-19 guidelines with masks and and social distancing being enforced. Hand sanitizer was provided and customers waited outside for their food.< /review>< pictures>

Kind of a long wait, but definitely worth it. Food and coffee are supreme! The couple who works here are very personable, the woman especially kind, always checking in and making sure that everyone is pleased with their order. I got the Nutella crepe and an Americano and both were great. A wonderful escape from the rain!<//Review>

Amazing crepes here in downtown Oceanside! The owners are a sweet little couple. There was also cool artwork they've made on the wall. We tried the ham and cheese, lemon and sugar, and the condensed milk. All three were fantastic. Fun to watch them make them or just sit and enjoy your cup of coffee. Will be back for sure!<//Review>

Wonderful experience. They couple running the place are super sweet and charming. Makes me feel like I'm at my grandmas house. My sister got told that she runs the place with Grandmas rules so no texting while eating. Food was really good. They give you plenty of crepe filled with whatever you choose. I got the nutella chocolate and my sister the sour cream raspberry. I can see why this place has such good reviews. Glad I stopped by!< /text>

I don't normally write reviews, but let me tell you these are some of the best crepes I've ever had. The first time I went I felt like I was back in my grandmas table, they were very friendly :)! I've been going back ever since and trying all the flavors.< /Text>

Outstanding restaurant if you are craving true French style crepes. My wife and I ordered the lemon crepe and I had a latte coffee. Everything was above and beyond delicious plus the conversation added to our positive experience. If you have a hankering for french crepes and good coffee you won't do better then Elena's French Crepes Cafe.</Text>

<text>My sister and I popped in on a whim the other morning, and we were so impressed! Elena and her husband were so welcoming and kind, the atmosphere was artsy and relaxing, and the crepes- OH the crepes! Outstanding. My sister and I each got sweet crepes, and were blown away by both the flavor and presentation. We will definitely be returning! Absolutely would recommend.</text>< Pics>

My friends & I each had a different crepe & all of them were delicious. Lovely little find! Elena was nice & friendly. We concur that the only thing that would make it better would be fresh fruit but still we highly recommend it!< /review>< rate>

It's a nice little crepes place on Pier View Way, next door to the Breakfast Club Diner.  The crepes were well prepared and the owners seem nice.  They had both savory and sweet crepes.  I had the ham and cheese crepe which was nice as well as the Nutella crepe -- also great.

Not much in the way of decor or seating inside.  Two tables were right outside.</text>

My high expectations were exceeded. This place is very unassuming. We walked in and were greeted by Elena. She recommended the ham and cheese and the Nutella & banana. The food was served in a few minutes and dayum! The food was delicious. Somehow the ham & cheese was dense and savory yet light as a feather. It was like a grilled cheese floating on air. Don't bring your mom here because the Nutella and banana will make you slap her face. Incredible!< /Text>

Amazing, amazing, amazing. Step 1. Don't walk, run to this place with a friend! Step 2. Order the ham & cheese and the banana & neutella. Step 3. Split each and enjoy the greatest savory-sweet combination since Larry Appleton and Balki Bartokomous.<//Text>

If you want great crepes come here! You will be welcomed by the nicest husband and wife couple who run the café by themselves. The crepes are amazing and its just a few blocks from the ocean. I recommend anything with Nutella.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Rich crepes but very small place, your added juices, fruits and chocolate milk to the menu, it would be great!

We are in the process of considering a reverse mortgage. Our counselor was very patient, very informative and our fee was waived due to an ongoing grant. That was a very nice surprise.<//Text>

<Review>The counselor was very knowledgeable and professional. I am refinancing a 10-year-old HECM, so I'm not new to reverse mortgages. However, during the session several concepts about what happens after I pass on were clarified. Now I feel very confident in explaining the reverse mortgage to my children.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

The counseling session started very close to the time it was scheduled. The counselor was very clear in her explanation of reverse mortgages. She was always willing to stop an answer a question. Would definitely recommend credit.org to anyone needing a HUD counseling.< /Review>

Great company to work with. Took their CalHFA class, and learned a lot about the process. We downloaded the worksheets (we pretty much created similar docs on our own) to use as a reference in the future to keep us on track.
The coach was great. Gave us a breakdown of what we were doing and what we needed to work on.<//Review>

If your credit score isn't at it VERY BEST, this is THE place to go.
They'll explain everything. They seem to know everything you could need.
Hands down, solved everything for me. FINALLY.<//review>

I called for information regarding a debt management/settlement program, but after being counseled I learned it was not necessary.  My debt issues are not as overwhelming as I perceived, and with some budgeting, I can do it myself!  I cannot tell you how inspired the credit counselor left me (I believe her name was Eleanor).</Text>

Our couch Leticia was very knowledgeable in the process of home buying and finances. Excellent customer service. Felt like we were talking with family and she was looking out in our best interest.< /review>

My credit counselor Lety was very informative, patient. She made me feel very comfortable asking questions. Her responses were clear and I felt encouraged to ask questions. I left the conversation with a better understanding On how important a budget is and actually how easy it is to save more.< /Text>

Also, it’s too expensive for how simple the online course is. Takes a long time too. They don’t inform you how long the test is or how long it will take. Took us a long time to get through it because we had to do it during the week after work and getting the kids to bed. We were exhausted by that time so we could only stay awake for parts at a time. Very boring reading when you have already gone through most of the process.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
What a complete pile of nonsense. Your property is just stolen by a corrupt institution and they supposedly want to "help" you but they record everything to give it to the bank or financial institution that just stole your property...and then tell you to go to other awful govt. agencies for more so called "help"!! They just set you up to get info so they pass it on...wow...how deep down this rabbit hole do we go? Stay away.
My suspensions are now confirmed...
Got an email from HUD asking where I was and how to reach me, this non-profit is an "inside" agency designed to assist in the theft of real estate from American citizens and then transfer the assets to "buddy investment groups" so banks have an arm
Length transaction on the theft of property.
This is serious....very diabolical.<//Review>

<text>Go somewhere else!  They have no idea of time keeping or appointment keeping.  If you must deal with these people and make a appointment, better plan on spending the whole day waiting.   Complete waste of time and since they never made their appointment I will have to waste another day trying to finish what I already started. My hands are tied but yours aren't. Avoid if possible<//text>< Pics>

<username>Purple RedHat< /username><date>1362825732707</date><Rate>2</Rate><Text>Prior Employee 2013 - In the time I worked for this company I unfortunately walked away disappointed. I have over 25 years experience in the mortgage industry and I do not have one unkind word for any of my prior employers. In those years I received numerous service excellence awards, cards and letters of appreciation for the job I do as a professional. At Springboard, I learned that none of this mattered, there is a strong alliance between the Latino/Hispanic staff. And what I saw was a jealousy or what is better described as fear of an individuals personal growth within the company. I found myself definitely questioning their ethics and integrity here. The employee atmosphere is tense, stressful and unprofessional to say the least. The quality of service depends on the mood of management . They run this organization like a sweat shop/slave driven workshop, "numbers over quality." Absolutely no respect for employees. I would highly recommend going somewhere else for assistance as they do train new employees for 2 weeks only to place them on a floor of supervisors or "team leads" with no respect for managerial authority. Simple case of "Too many Chiefs, not enough Indians." Each Team Lead has his or her rules, and they want you to follow them and not management, which is confusing for a new person. Follow at your own risk, in my experience this type of managerial floor breeds back biting and dishonesty which will yield failure in the end. Overall, the training was great but was not reflected in service. Personally, I thought after attending training needed to be shortened and revamped according to employee or customer feedback. The counseling calls are way too long for what a client receives, which is a recommendation. Homeowners can gain this information surfing the web or from calling your lender. Just call your bank and speak to your Loss Mitigation Department. One way Springboard makes their money is being paid by (HPF) Homeowner Preservation Foundation by way of your lender approximately $150.00 a session. Hope this helps you make your decision.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>
