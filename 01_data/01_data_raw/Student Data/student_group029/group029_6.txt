<text>I've been going here my entire adult life, between 3-20 times a year. The atmosphere is very casual and family friendly. The prices and service have always made it feel great to leave a good tip. Even when we haven't come in for a long time, retiring, we are treated like family. Please support them in these trying times!</text><userid>100669984596004986194</userid><pictures>None</pictures><time>1613348837905</time><gmap_id>0x80e825232540bce7:0x1071678fd4a74bd0<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We have been coming here for years. The owner is super friendly always comes to hang out n chat and gives us his special home made hot sauces. Proceed with caution if you try one they are hot! Good food for the price. One of the few places around here you can get away with a 10$ meal</Text>

While the assembly line might lack in overall freshness - it makes up for it with options.

Also, the dinner deal makes this my favorite Mongolian BBQ spot in all of Thousand Oaks.

Great service, and usually some sports on TV if you’re having lunch.

Lots of food for a fair price - and the owner has no problem setting you up with a take-home plate.</review><Time>1606960454447</Time>< Resp>

<Review>Best noodles you’ll have!!  You can build your bowl with whatever you want, as large at you want. (You have to be good as adding the noodles at the end to make it bigger). The service is amazing, because the owner is one of the greatest guys!  (For me, it’s more worth it to come for lunch because it’s less expensive than all you can eat dinner, and you can get a to go box). Not to mention the whisking and taste is nothing short of phenomenal!  Truly one of Thousand Oaks wonders!</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrcVzfGMS8O1Oon_IhtcynaolQkwT9x0utS6sO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5T8-1oe35buNENBTrzDHrACofpSVPyY0zvIX4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Good food, lunch is ~$10 as much as you can fit into a bowl (just make sure you compress the items as much as possible). Dinner is ~14, but it's all you can eat. Allow yourself for plenty of time and bring an appetite.< /Review>

This Mongolian BBQ has been around since the 70s. I used to own the camera shop that was next door to the restaurant. Would go in there at least two or three times a week for lunch or dinner. I love the food though I do wish the selection of vegetables was more. We moved our location of the camera shop and Mongolian BBQ eventually expanded out knock down the wall and double their size. Whenever we go to Thousand Oaks we eat there. Still love the food<//text>

<Review>So glad that we have a Mongolian BBQ in T.O. It is delicious and a fun way to cook food. They have added a few items lately to throw on the grill, but there is always room to add more. It's all you can eat, but I usually don't finish my 2nd dish!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Really great family place if you're looking for a place that is casual and homey with good quality food and great service without needing the expensive fancy decor. Staff is extra friendly and attentive and was so impressed at how kind and equally attentive they were to kids eating there. Lot of healthy and delicious flavorful options to pick and choose for all tastes so appeals to all. Brought a large group in and it was perfect as everyone made their own dish to order so appealed to everyone.< /Review>< name>

<user>102246791629412008901</user><review>I have been coming to this Mongolian BBQ since the mid 1980's, when it was Lusty's Mongolian BBQ, and I was still in high school. The restaurant is much bigger now (they expanded into the space next door), and the food is just as wonderful as it always has been. They have a great selection of items to fill your bowl with, and each entree includes their wonderful soup, potstickers and flat bread. When I'm in Thousand Oaks, I always try to stop by. The staff is always friendly and the food fabulous. What more could you want?< /review>< pics>

Great place to catch the sunset. A little crowded at times. Parking is definitely easier off season.</text>

This is a wonderful beach access. Expect to park a couple of blocks away, but the walk is worth it! The surf break is nice, too. We had the best time.</text>

Beautiful view walking down the stairs on to the beach. Well lit and safe. Benches available to take a little break or to watch the sunset without being in the sand.<//Text>

It's one of the best shops that I've seen in a long time. However, cashiers was nice but they have a small quantity of men's wears shorts and so on but they all around experience was four stars.< /text>

What the heck happened to one of my favorite thrift stores? This used to be such a fun place to dig through junk. Now it's set up like a regular store. Overpriced, boring things. The whole time I'm in the store the manager is screaming at the employees about merchandising. MERCHANDISING? That's not why most of us go to thrift stores, I'll just go to Ross instead. Mourning the loss of year another funky, fun thrift store. This place SUCKS.< /Review>

Well unfortunately the people that control the Salvation Army, and just as much as the Goodwill as far as that's concerned have managed to screw up every possible vintage, used Goods, True Thrift Store on all levels. They've streamlined everything to where it's nothing but an underrated used Sears Outlet store. Pass pass pass and shame on all you corporate Giants thinking you were doing something wonderful when you took away all of our goody yummy Thrifty fun time. Don't shop at any of them it's a waste of time!< /Review>

They have been open since Friday and doing a good business, yet not too crowded. The store had gotten a facelift while closed and is bright and cheery! Lots of stuff, but not the furniture that they usually have. They said they will get more soon.<//Review>

Great air conditioning and clothing sizes and category are clearly labeled and easy to find. Friendly and helpful staff. Best of all, awesome prices!! Even better, EVERYTHING WAS HALF OFF!

I just came to drop off an item and the gentleman who thought he was being helpful came out with a really nasty attitude telling me  in a dissed tasteful manner what I need to do next time. I fully let him aware that I had the intentions on putting the item together and letting them know that I dropped it off and helping them bring it in. Mind you I unloaded the dresser that I dropped off and put it together and the gentleman who helps load the trucks and or possibly bring the items in was extremely disrespectful. I asked to speak to a manager and all she had to say was OK. I will never drop off my items to the Salvation Army again due to their lack of customer service. I hope anyone that’s going into buy these items Gets treated with some sort of respect. There was another coworker at the register when I was explaining what happened who thought it was OK to laugh at me. Tip for life if you’re not happy with the job you have go find another one.</Review>

I am sick and tired of seeing one person on those trucks, hurting their bodies, over- lifting because you don't have enough help.  You need to hire some temporary help ASAP,  or I will no longer be shopping there.< /Review>

<review>If you're looking for gently used designer clothing, handbags, shoes, or good used books - - this is not the place. If you're just looking to find clothing to cover your body parts, this place is a good start. However, I've found their prices are higher than thrift shops with much better quality clothing.< /review>< pictures>

Beautiful place but now, there are a lot of homeless and  smell very bad, also there tennagers smoking marihuana there, the police should take a look there for the kids security, these things shouldn't be happening in recreational areas< /Text>

Love this place. Dentists are amazing, staff are wonderful. And enough entertainment to keep my 2 year old and 4 year old entertained while we wait our turn.

Been coming here since they opened and really happy that I did. The last location I went to for my 4 year old was terrible. Once I waited 2 hours to be seen and I had an appt.

This place is efficient, timely but also you get to spend good time with the doctor who does a thorough job explaining the issues at hand.< /Text>

Wonderful first experience here! Everyone from the front office, office manager, x-ray tech, and the dentist are truly so sweet, patient, and helpful. Even the other patients and the families were so sweet!

The office has a circus theme with a big waiting area, video games, and even a movie theater where Toy Story was playing. Super cute!

I highly recommend this pediatric dentist office. Happy to have found this office for my girls!< /Review>

<Review>I had a great experience as a new patient for my son. The waiting wasn’t long and everything seemed to go by quickly. Everyone here is very nice and patient. Glad to have signed my 2 yr old son to this dental office. Definitely would recommend. Thank you for the amazing experience! (:<//Review>< user>

<text>I had to drive 1.5 hours  to this office as no local office would accept my insurance.  Everyone at this office is amazing. They truly care about their patients. My child need a good amount of work done and they were able to treat her that day so we would not have to make another trip. My daughter was so relaxed and enjoyed her time at the dentist. She can't wait to go back. If you are in the LA area and looking for a great pediatric dentist this is the one you want.

Thank you again for the amazing service!  I will glad send anyone your way so worth the drive!!!</text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1617294598153, 'text': 'Hi, Jennifer.

< review>
I am so Thankful we found this Dental office. A close friend told me about how great their experience was at Magicland Pacoima. So we decided to bring my Autistic Son to Magicland. Our experience has been amazing!! They have been so accommodating with my son's needs. We drive here from the Antelope Valley once a month for his orthodontist appointment and it is totally worth the drive!! I totally recommend this office for any child with or without special needs. AND the office is super clean and there are things for the kiddos to do while they wait. Especially love the small movie theatre.. Amazing place!! Thank you Magicland for making the atmosphere calming!!❤❤</review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>First of all Magicland Dental Group the actual office from the outside all the way in is absolutely beautiful and childlike. Today they had an Easter Bunny out front making balloons for the children. For my children they love Easter and this was a nice surprise. Not to mention the decor at the actual office the TV's the game PlayStation and the actual office itself is very clean open and the staff are very very welcoming. I had some issues with my insurance and the manager was able to help me in spite of my difficulties. During this time and all that we are going through and I world today I was having a really hard time getting my children to the appointments that I made three times previous to today. So to not have them be seen today would have been such a loss of time. However, the manager was graceful enough to see us in spite of the difficulty. For this I was truly grateful to God that my children were able to be seen today. We made another appointment in about a month for my children to be seen once more. I look forward to this appointment. I would highly highly recommend Magicland Dental Group for any child to go to. My children love going to this dental office they are actually excited to go. I pray for continued success for Magicland, the staff, and all the patients that are to come. Be Blessed</review>< pictures>

<review>I thought my appointment(s) where at 12:30pm, but in reality my appointment where set for 12pm (yikes). Despite that my arrival time was at 12:15 technically I'm late. They took both of my children ages 6 and 9. They where both excited as soon as they walked into the building. Nice atmosphere was very peaceful. Friendly staff!
My kids where happy with their goodie bags at the end of their visit!
Thanks!</review>< Pics>

This location has the most friendly and reliable dentistry and don't get me started on the manager on-site, she is awesome!!!! I wish all locations had a manager that is professional and cares about her patients, I mean it! My son and I were experiencing insurance problems and the manager went out of her way to resolve the problem, loved it! You rock women!< /text>

<text>My boys had their first dental visit here today and wow they really liked it here. My 7 year old actually did not panic (he had a traumatic experience when he was like 4 at a doctor visit that ever since he would be afraid to visit the doctor or even the dentist). Definitely amazed by how friendly the staff was and how interactive they were with my boys. We will definitely keep coming to this dental office.<//text>< resp>

Staff is very friendly and my kids like going there but having to wait so long is ridiculous. Came back for another appointment to visit the orthodontist and waited a whole hour as I watched other patients that came in 30 minutes after me get called in. I wasn’t expecting to be in and out but waiting an hour just for a ortho consultation is just too much. I gave them a chance but that was my third time there and each time the wait was just too long. I expect to make an appointment and get called in at least 15-30 after my scheduled appointment time, not an hour. So if you don’t mind waiting, give them a try.</text>< response>

<Review>I started bringing my kids to this dental location because my previous children's dentist wasn't child friendly they scared my 1 year old, my 3 year old dreaded the dentist. Since coming here just the first time my kids loved it my 11 year old just had praises on his experience, both my 1 and 3 year old let their teeth be brushed. My 3 year old keeps saying dentist said I have to brush my teeth everyday. I loved how patient the staff is with children they made sure my children were comfortable and not scared. My 1 year old was laying down head on drs lap and her legs on mine and the dr kept talking to her she was scared but relaxed once it was over she didn't scream historically like with previous dentist. Highly recommend this location.< /Review><UserId.>116441050236091697801</UserId.><name>Jessie Zendejas<//name></record></dataset><record>

He enjoyed it and was not afraid, the first visit was really good. The reason I'm giving 1 star is because I was told they were going to check with insurance for his fluoride treatment, after 2 months no one ever called me. I called the office and talked to Valerie and said she was going to talk to the manager and find out what happen. 1 week passed and again no one called me, I called and Valerie answer me again. She apologized and said that my son needed a referral for every time he needed something done, I was never told that and I think is absurd because I had already gotten a referral from the beginning. So disappointed with this office it is kid friendly but the way they deal with things is not right. I decided to change from this office to a different place. I hope no one else goes through this situation as I did.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<review>This was my daughter’s 1st visit to this office. The facility was really clean and the staff were extremely nice, friendly and professional. It was very colorful and inviting for young children. Even though the referring dental office did not provide me with the referral, they called the other office to have the referral sent over. I was also able to email them the copy of the daughter’s insurance card because I totally forgot to bring it.
I am glad the daughter will be having her services here. They appear to actually see children her age (4y/o) and are prepared to work with them in a gentle and caring manner!< /review><gmap_id>0x80c291025a3d315b:0xa8d9bf21cc36d361<//gmap_id><pics>None</pics>< date>

<Review>Where do I even begin. Waiting room had over 6 people. X-ray tech was rude and not friendly. I was not given enough instruction when dentist came in the room to do the exam on my daughter. It was an absolute nightmare. Dentist did not even try to interact with my 2 year old. For a dental office that specializes in children, they didn’t know how to treat my child. The only employee that did an amazing job was the one that did the prophy because she interacted with my child. Not Impressed. Will not be taking my daughter back to any magicland dental.</Review><GmapID>0x80c291025a3d315b:0xa8d9bf21cc36d361</GmapID>< time>

<username>Elizabeth Amaya<//username><text>I decided to bring my children to this Dental office after a bad experience in another dental place. My 8 year old son tends to ask questions about what is going to be done to him and the Dentist explained to him with details and was very patient with him. My 6 year old had his first teeth removed and he was so proud of it! They were also so patient with my 3 year old dental check up!  You made their experience so much better and now they ask all the time when they are going back! Thank you<//text><Response>None<//Response>< pics>

<text>Today was my daughters first visit at this dental office, and I love how friendly the staff is to the kids. My daughter is 3 and I thought she would cry, but no the dental assistant and the doctor were very informative. Letting my daughter know what they were doing to her and explaining what each tool was for and just gain her trust. Was a major plus for me! I would really recommend this place for my friends and family!

Compare to other children dental place. This one I liked this dental office!</text>< pictures>

<time>1614064406026< /time><Rate>5< /Rate><review>I took my daughter last week for an emergency exam since she started complaining of a tooth ache, they were able to fit her in the next morning. As soon as we walked in I felt at ease, Mary the office manager was so sweet and caring with my 4 year old daughter, Once her X-rays were taken the Dr. ( Dr. Josefsson) broke the news to me, my daughter needed a pulpotomy (baby root canal) in order to save her tooth. They both took the time to explain the procedure and were kind enough to fit me in the same day for treatment to get her out of pain. We returned a few hours later and we were in and out in no time. The process was fast and my daughter said it didn’t hurt at all. I will be recommending everyone I know for their Children’s dental work. They are caring, kind and extremely profesional. Thank you Mary and Dr. Josefsson for your amazing work!!< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Minutes later they both got call in at the time and 30 minutes after they were done. Wow thank you Mary (Office Manager) for all your help with Insurances your team is Amazing!!!!

This assistant with blue eyeliner said i could not be in the hallway carrying my baby because it was a health hazard however, their fire extinguisher glass door was open, unlocked so anyone that walked by too close could have swung it open. My daughter told me that when I was not in the room the assistant told the doctor just don't talk to her don't say anything(gives me sign that they probably say mean things to other kids when they're parents are not around) My daughter is 9, she also told me the assistant told her tell your mom you had a great experience and that you want to come back and that we were all very nice to you. Uuumm I'm sorry, if you want to control and manipulate my daughter into coming into your business, we're not!! Very Very unprofessional!!! PS I don't even think the dentist there is a certified Pedodontist. She might just be a general dentist.</Text></record>

I’m happy to see also males in the office my son and I felt very confortable with them... that was a 10. After they referred me to the lady in charge of the cost ... the fist thing she said Hi my name is Mary and I will be helping you to get you started. She was very nice and professional and yes she did made it happen, she took the time to explain and answer all my questions... I’m very please with her customer service... and like she said we will be seen each other for a long time .

<review>I moved from a Van Nuys office to the pacoima office and like always the staff from the back office is really nice and helpful but much to say about front staff there are some people that are so rude and of course it’s the same girl that travels from Pacoima to van nuys she just looks like she hates her job don’t know her name but I will try to get it for the next time</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user_id>

A few points to cover - the location is new, so everything is clean and crisp. The admin staff was attentive and professional and the medical staff was patient and friendly, which I throughly appreciate! The space was kid friendly, which made my child excited to see all the bright colors and murals around the office. I would suggest ponywalls to separate the kids in the exam room, other than that, I was able to keep my child calm and attentive...a little bribery with icecream doesn't hurt lol.< /Text>

Wait is ridiculous. My son said the dentist didn't even speak to him and was putting her hands all over his face without communicating. She began pulling off his mask without asking him to remove it himself. Then opening his mouth without directing him.<//Review>

Horrible never going back they tied my baby's wrists so tight they stopped the circulation and my baby's hands were swollen and purple when I was able to return to the room and the dark Hispanic lady tried to tell me that, that's how her hands are cause she's chubby I know my child ,then she tried to massage her hands saying let's start some circulation going ,her hair was mess like she had been strangled, they left bruising on her cheekbones I believe from them holding her to tight ,so what the point of medication and that laughing gas if they still have to manhandle a child like this ,and yes I took pictures immediately and further action will be taken, horrible experience nothing magical about this place</text>

Went to this place a couple of days ago for new rear axle tires.  One of the best customer services I've had in years.  You have this employee by the name of Gary who really knows what it means to treat customers the right way.  -----  This is a nice clean shop and I do highly recommend this place.</Text>

The funny Big O Tires commercial that had the wobbly wheel and jiggling gelatin brought me into the Big O Tires in West Covina near my sister's home. From the start, I have always had excellent service from manager Gary Haskell and his team has provided the best tires and greatest service for my Mazda.
Yesterday I brought in my Mazda for an emergency repair.
Deyvi Salmeron assisted me quickly and professionally. He and his team found the reason for my car violently shaking near 50 mph. A pothole had broken my tire. Deyvi found me a replacement and within a few hours, I was on my way.
Deyvi is an asset to Big O Tires. He took a call while he was assisting me and spoke perfect Spanish to the customer who was requesting information over the phone. Kudos Big O Tires and to Gary and Deyvi and the whole team!<//text>

<review>The rep asked for my make and model then quoted me $50. After arriving he told me it will cost a few dollars more so I said ok (unhappy because I was expecting 5 dollars more turns out a couple bucks was $20 to him) total was now $70. I would have changed it myself for $30 and get a brand name oil filter. Quoting an oil change should not have any surprises like repairing a car.

I was in no hurry to get my car because I didn't need it that day but the time to change my oil was 3 hours. I picked it up end of day and my car door was not locked. Good thing I don't have valuables in there< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1615218689248, 'text': 'Hi Kwan, customer satisfaction is important to us.

Really helpful staff. Told them my car said “low tire pressure” and they were kind enough to check every tire, and fill with air for me. Grateful for this free service they provided.<//text>

<text>Ordering the tires and rims were no problem, installing was another issue. I had an APPOINTMENT and  still had to wait around for over an HOUR  before my car moved. If an appointment can't be close to the time, spread them out. Missing another important meeting because of this.</text>< user_name>

The service was great, however it took 5 hours to get new tires and a wheel alignment. I wasn’t offered any compensation. An apology was giving, since I was told it would be ready at a different time 3 times. It went from 3-4 hours to 30-45 more minutes to another half an hour.  Other than the long time frame,<//Text>

I originally went in for an oil changer and received a call about an oil leak and belts needing to be repaired. Cesar helped me out with a finance option which in the end worked out great. I always had a mechanic in the family growing up but now I can say I fully trust this place always looking out for me and letting me know whats going on with my car. I will definitely be back!< /review>

<review>This shop really knows what they're doing! When it comes to alignment it is spot-on. I've been to many alignment shops and they're always off slightly. These techs get it right every time!

My boyfriend needed new tires and we went to different places for a good deal and this place had the best, it includ balance, alignment, rotation, road assistance service and a great tire warranty in case of anything. We thought they had these special only for black Friday but they actually have it all the time, the service was excellent, fast and professional. We left very happy with 4 new tires and satisfied with the service they gave us.<//Text>

Fast easy and decent prices.

Update:  dropped to 2 stars.  Tried to remove a wheel they put a tire on.  No wrench of any kind would budge one of the lug bolts.  Impact wrench wouldn't move it.  Heat, penetrating lube, nothing.  I dont know why people only use impact wrenches cranked up to 11 to put on tires<//review>

Honestly, I never write reviews but I had 1/2 of my psi go out in one of my rear tires at Costco so I said well, I’ll just have it looked at/repaired here. And that’s where I went wrong....Costco took over an hour, almost 1.5 hours, to tell me that they couldn’t repair the hole in my tire because it was in a “difficult place” so they refunded me my $10.99 and loaded my tire with enough air to get home.

Well, I knew this Big O Tires was just down the street from my house so I gave them a call to see if they even had my tire size in stock because I was told by Costco that it couldn’t be fixed according to their standards and if I wanted new tires I’d have to buy all 4 (they won’t sell you just 1) and it would take 3-5 days to order........

So I call and long and behold a nice lady from Big O gives me prices on 2 tires then a man named Gary takes the phone and basically said, those Costco people don’t know what they are doing, let me take a look at it and try to fix it, if not then we can get you a new tire today or by tomorrow.

I AM LITERALLY BLOWN AWAY BY HIS CAN DO ATTITUDE AND DETAIL TO CUSTOMER SERVICE.

I arrived a little after 5:30 (they close at 6) and he has me in and out before closing with a patched up/repaired tire so that I can be on my way to tutor my summer students with NO CHARGE.

Let me just say as both a woman and a teacher money isn’t always readily available to just drop and dealing with my vehicle at mechanics and auto shops make me extremely anxious. I do have money for an emergency like a new tire, etc but teaching all year + summer school + private tutoring.... well I’m literally working all year with no real break to make my paychecks last.

So I’d like to say THANK YOU GARY! This teacher truly appreciates everything you did to take care of me on 7/9/19!<//Text>

When I called the store, Brian helped and explained me how the Buy Two tires, Get two tires free works (President Day Sale). He was very knowledgeable about everything, but I told him that I will call him back because I have to discuss it with my wife first. When I called back, I spoke with  Cesar and he made the appointment for me. When I got to the store, Gary pulled out my information and helped me right away. The store was very clean and very presentable to customers. I was also treated very well. So thank you to the Three people on the store that made it very easy for me. This is what Customer Service is all about. Now you have my business!!!</text>

< review>
My check engine light came and so I swung by and had a gentleman who manages the place. Gary Haskell, the manager walked me through the whole process and explained that I had an issue that was able to be corrected and I always thought I had to go to the dealer to resolve a check engine light not thinking Big0 tires did service but I soon realized that they do .. not only was I explained what the symbolizes mean but how quickly and simple it was to be resolved . Very glad I no longer half to have the to dealer to be committed to the to dealer I was able to resolve that issue but knowing The Management and experience that Gary  Haskell the manager and his team offer I was confident they could and will resolve this issue !! And they did at reasonable cost !!
My family and I are committed to this location due to there great service !! Don't miss out on the best service I have ever experienced!! If you don't believe my review just find out in your own!! So glad I stopped by to find that they are able to help and I was impressed with their attitudes, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!< /review>

<text>Let me start off by saying that the month of May was, essentially, hell for me and my car and this Big-O location and Gary, specifically, eased that a bit. I took my car in at the beginning of May to have the fuel pump replaced as my car wasn't starting and, having had a similar problem with a previous car, I knew the signs. However, after replacing the fuel pump, we were still having problems. The car was fine for a week and then, again, wouldn't start for anything. So I brought her back and Gary immediately apologized for us having to bring her back so soon after our previous visit. After that, it was two weeks of limbo as Gary and his team tried to figure out what was wrong with the car. Every time we thought we knew what it was, they'd fix it and then, after an hour or so of testing, it wouldn't start again despite having started just fine a minute or two previous. And every step of the way Gary kept me updated. He'd call me and let me know what they'd tried and what they thought it was. He was always upfront with me about whether it was worth it to continue to try to sort out the problem given that the car itself is older. He promised that the car itself was solid. This glitch was just that. A glitch. Finally, it all boiled down to the internal computer that needed to be replaced and when I heard that all I saw was dollar signs flashing in front of me. Instead, Gary quoted me a reasonable price and, with their financing option, I was able to afford to get the necessary work done. Now, my car, thus far, has been running beautifully and I couldn't be more thankful for Gary and his team for taking such good care of my car and of me. This was a stressful and anxiety inducing few weeks, but, thanks to Gary, I knew that we were in good hands. Thank you guys so much!<//text>< Pictures>

Not Just Oil & Tires:
Diagnostic, Shock & Strauts, Breaks...

When you first walk in you are very impressed by how clean the facility is.
I would highly recommend this Big O Tire to anyone.

The staff is very friendly and the service is very quick, the prices are very fair and competitive.

The waiting area is very comfortable with a large screen TV, free refrigerated bottled water and hot coffee.  There are two single-use coed restrooms which are kept very clean. The facility is handicap friendly and accessible.

Overall the experience is excellent, you will walk away very pleased and will no doubt be back.

They are located at the opposite corner of Social Security next to Dollar Tree and Goodwill in the quad by McDonald's and Pollo Loco. Plenty of parking all around.<//text>< Rate>

Took my car for an oil change and tire rotation special. I'm giving three stars because the oil change and rotation was fine and done correctly, but  they misdiagnosed a problem with my car after their inspection. The manager pointed out I had a problem with the brake rotors on my car wearing unevenly, which to be fair, he did show me in person and there was a genuine problem with the brakes. However, he told me it would be fixed with a brake fluid flush and a rotor/pad change. I'm a shadetree mechanic who works on my car and I took my car to Big O for an oil change because I have nowhere to work at my residence. At this point, I asked him again if that would fix it and he said "yes." Uneven wear in brakes usually comes from a misaligned/damaged parking brake mechanism or a problem with the caliper pistons.

I took the car to my mechanic uncle and the caliper pistons were shot, which are the things that the fluid pushes to push the pads against the rotor. You cannot fix a broken disc brake caliper by only changing the brake pads and rotors then doing a fluid change. You either have to rebuild the caliper pistons or replace the caliper, and optimally it should be on both sides. I ended up replacing both calipers and rotors with my uncle, but if I would have followed their recommendations, I'd either have to pay more to replace the caliper or have an improper fix.<//Text>

<Text>Unbelievably long wait times to get service - 3+ hours to be more precise. They didn't even move my car into an open stall until 2 hours had passed and I  asked how much longer it would be. Then they went out and took a joy ride with my car before  putting it in for service.The sales people are only interested in filling up their stalls so that you are stuck and forced to wait or pay for services rendered. Its a ridiculous scheme that you would probably better served by the America's best tire acoss the street

*Update*
Not only did he ask after 3 hours if I could come back for an alignment, but then after I voiced my frustration he came back and said "oh nevermind it's done." The alignment paperwork showed no car information but the make, model, and year (which was wrong). I told them to put on the correct information and they told me it would be 45 minutes at least to do that so I waited because I'm not going to get ripped off. They ended up coming out 15 minutes later to tell me they have a software glitch that does not allow them to print out the information and told me they would just add it to Carfax. Honestly, this place is a complete joke.

TLDR - They're slow/inexperienced, understaffed, and shady.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I’ve been threaded here many times, and it’s always been great, so I decided I would try waxing...which was a mistake. The waxing itself was fine, but the room was dirty. The trash was overflowing, there was wax on the table which led me to believe it wasn’t cleaned, the chair had foil over it with oil residue on it. The technician handed me a robe which had wax on it, so I couldn’t even be sure that was clean. After the wax was over, the technician pulled new paper over the table and left making me believe there would be no further cleaning of the room before the next client. Needless to say, I will never be back for any waxing service.<//Text>

Sapna is amazing! I’ve been coming to Vinita’s for about 8 years and I won’t let anyone else touch my brows. I moved from Pasadena and will still drive from Los Angeles faithfully for her service. I always get complimented on my brows! Highly highly recommend.< /Review>

<review>Threading was great and I love the way my eyebrows look. However, I asked if they could wax my face, which they said they could. The waxing was horrible.

Sapna is very talented at eyebrow shaping! She has been doing my eyebrows since 2009. I have tried other places, but I always come back to her. Convenient location. But it is easy to miss if driving.<//Review>

<date>1484621175635< /date><text>There are still some character/cartoons who does not leave a chance to insult Indians. They were passing comments in HINDI when I was waiting to get my haircut today around 6 pm. Deliberately they were asking multiple times whether I know HINDI or not. And they will laugh when you say yes. I waited next 30 mnts and then cancelled my appointment.

One-time I thought to call COP. But I don't have time to do that.
Any way guys ..... There are plenty of good perlour around. Check out.

<text>That's true Prithwi. I had similar experience couple of days ago. Felt very bad. Me and my family stopped going there. My colleague suggested another parlor in Artecia on pioneer Blvd. Go there or you can try in Pasadena also. There are so many good parlors. Feeling Sad for you bro. Hope it does not happen to anyone else.</text>< user_name>

< Review>
This is a awesome animal hospital. Been taking my baby there now for 3 years. Great service. Explains everything until you understand every thing that is going on with your baby or babies. I recommend them even during this virus.they have made adjustments so we would still comfortable about our animals being there even thro we can go in they keep you updated.</Review>

I was referred to Banfield Pet Hospital by Alaska Airlines to specifically retrieve a Health Certificate for my dog as we have already booked a flight, pet friendly hotel and rented a car surrounding this date. I now have to extend my stay for even longer and spend even more to locate a reliable vet who is able to take us in ASAP. This place is inconvenient. After I had dropped him off, I received a phone call stating I had been scheduled for the wrong thing and the current Physician is unable to administer the Health Certificate as I had been referred. In all of my years of pet ownership, this is the worst experience I have had with a pet hospital.</Review>

Negligent staff and doctors. Don't bring your cat here if you want them to be competently examined.

My partner and I took our newly adopted kitten here in December to be checked out because we wanted her to be all cleared by a vet before letting her roam our apartment and introducing her to our older cat; she also had plastic non-dissolvable stitches that the shelter told us had to be removed. Banfield kept our kitten for 8hours. In that time, they only called us once or twice to tell is that she would be done "soon". One of those times the Vet (Dr. Friske) called and told us that she was having trouble removing the stitches and that we should just let them dissolve. We had to point out to the vet that they were plastic ones that would never dissolve. It was disappointing that the vet couldn't even tell.

After 8hours, we finally got our kitten back and thought she was all cleared after being tested and checked by the vet. We were wrong; that same night we noticed a round lesion on her leg that some googling quickly diagnosed as ringworm. We called the vet first thing in the morning asking them to confirm it was ringworm so that we could get her started on treatment. They made us pay the $64 general office visit fee even though we were there less than 24hours ago. They made us pay that fee even though this was something that absolutely should have been noticed in the 8 hours she was there the day prior. What could possibly justify keeping a cat for 8 hours and not noticing ringworm? The worst part wasn't even that we had to spend more money, it was the fact that we had so much anxiety and stress worrying that our older cat had also been exposed to ringworm because we had taken the vet visit as a green light for letting our kitten explore our apartment.

We have since switched vets over to West Coast Animal Hospital and are much happier with the level of attention and care that their office provided.</Text>

<Review>This is our new favorite hospital. I had a semiemergency apt with the chief doctor, and she was absolutely amazing. Very intelligent, kind, understanding, and professional. I used to be a Vet Tech years ago and everything she said was spot on from what I was taught (she knows WAY more than me but it was nice to hear things I knew for a fact).  I've also heard nothing by great things about the male doctor that is here also.  The employees were all kind, intelligent, and professional.  Overall very impressed. Also the price was outstanding thanks to their insurance plan!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Should’ve done better research before getting stuck with this pet hospital for a year for my puppy. Not sure if it’s all vets here but at least mine is someone that will always recommend the most expensive and unnecessary treatments. If you are a first time pet owner like me, go somewhere else! And don’t do the puppy plan!< /text>

<Review>This was the first time I've ever visited a Banfield facility. It's only a block away from where I live, so it seemed convenient when my cat developed problems with his ears. I was able to get an appointment the same day, which was good. The doctor was very polite, but most of the exam and follow up were performed by the vet tech. I was told my total bill would be $77, but when I got to the lobby to pay, it was now $160. Big difference! I was told it was the two "prescriptions" provided to me, that hadn't been included. I was charged $46 for a 7.5ml bottle of ear drops. and $37 for an ear flush liquid. When I got home, I discovered I could have purchased the $46 item for $11.75 at PetSmart. It's not even a prescription, it's over the counter. I am a senior and on a fixed income and that was a major expense for me. Can't believe they didn't just write it down and tell me where I could purchase it...or at least offer me the option to do that. Don't believe I'll go back.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I have a cat that I bring here and every time I make an appointment I have to leave her for 4+ hours at a time, I think this is weird and I've never had to do this before unless there's a surgery involved. A normal annual checkup should not take 4+ hours that means my cat has to sit there in a kennel with no food, water, or litter. If you make an appointment you should be able to be seen right away and be out of there within the hour this is bizzare to me and I will be taking my cat else where from now on.< /review>

Let me start of by saying... My heart is shattered. It took me this long, exactly 4 months later, to want to post a review.
From November 2016 til March 2018 Banfield worked with us to attempt to figure out what was wrong with our pup.
She was a incredibly small Siberian Husky.
She had vomiting issues.

I was going to share her story, but it's too long for the reviews so to break it down.

Banfield did everything they could for Aurora. We spent $$$. We went into debt. From Nov 2016 to March 2018 banfield stood by us and tried to help find the cause of Auroras vomiting. Feb 2018 we could finally afford more so we did xray, and she needed intestine surgery.
We did it but Aurora decided after surgery and being home, she had to eat a bag as a midnight snack... I had only fallen asleep for an hour.... an hour I'll now always regret. She vomited it up but I guess not before it possibly ruined her stitches. She had not ate things like this before. Just food. I had no way of knowing she would.... (it was a bag of clothes... no good scents even in it... )
We had just used ALL the income we could. (Care credit, Income tax, and even tried a GoFundMe that failed.)
March 11th Aurora was seizing and couldn't stand. We took her in and the vet said it would cost lots of money with no real idea if it'll save her or the other option.... She was already showing signs of neurological disorder. She looked tired, weak... she looked done. You could tell in her eyes she was done.
I have a video of her licking my tears away as if to say it's okay.
I tried so hard to save her like she once saved me.
When she came into my life, she was becoming my emotional support animal. She saved me from depression after a miscarriage. She then gave me the strength to move across country, away from family, and she was there when I brought our son home after a successful pregnancy. She was my life support. My child. My best friend.

Theres so many pieces of this story I had to chop out because of it being too long. But please know I tried everything. Banfield did amazing. Every doctor and assistant showed Aurora so much love. The day Aurora left us, it felt like everyone there felt my pain. Kelsey, I believe, took her pawprints for me when I brought back an inkpad. Kelsey doesn't realize how much that means to me because now I permanently have Auroras print on my body, just as it is in my heart.
Banfield was like family and sometimes I think of stopping by there but I imagine they would think I'm odd, lol....

I've had a rough time coping with the loss of her.
I will ALWAYS blame myself for Aurora's passing.
Aurora would of been 2 June 14th this year. 💔

Thank you so much Banfield dr. and assistants. You tried everything. If I had just been a little richer, maybe we could of truly fixed her. Or maybe if I hadn't fallen asleep, the surgery would of been enough....

I'm still thankful for you all. Seriously so much. I can't say it enough.

**The pictures are the tattoo I got for her after she was gone.
And her with my son. She passed just as he was becoming mobile. If she was here now. She would LOVE having him chase her around. I wish they could of grown together like I envisioned..</review>

I would not advise anyone I know to take their pet to this location. The incompetence of this place astounds me.  I started out going to this Banfield because it's the closest one to me. I took my cat there twice (or maybe three times) with no issues. This was about a year ago. So, when it came time for her to go in earlier this year, I took her back to this location.

After every visit this year, she would come home traumatized. It would take days before she would start acting like herself. She's never been thrilled about the vet, but she's never had such an adverse reaction to going until now. At first I tried to brush it off as if it was all her; the first time she was sick so it very easily could have been her or maybe she was just getting a little grouchy as she got older.  I didn't know for sure, but after a couple times, you do start to wonder if it's the vet's office rather than your pet.

The final straw that confirmed my suspicion was when I brought her home after an attempted teeth cleaning; they were unable to perform the procedure because she was too worked up. When I got her home to remove the bandage from where they drew blood, I understood why she was so worked up. Whoever did it did a terrible job! She had a limp, a larger than usual hole where they drew blood, and a good amount of blood in her fur.  Great work, guys. Truly what ever pet owner wants to see when they pick up their animal. I kept an eye on it, and a huge bruise developed the next day. The bruise and limp were there for several days. Needless to say, she will never return to this location.

The incompetence of the people at this location reached a new height after I took her to the Point Loma location. She needed a certificate of health to fly, so she had to go in for a quick exam. When the vet came in, his first comment was, "You know she's overdue for like almost everything, right?" Gee, no, I didn't. The incompetent people at the downtown location literally never said a word to me about her being overdue for several of her shots the many times she's been there and the many times I've spoken to them in the past few months. I had even mentioned how she would be flying soon to several people there, including two vets, and no one said a word to me about the shots. And it wasn't even a money issue because the shots she needed are included in her wellness plan.

Great job, downtown location. Way to set the bar super low.</Text>

My dog began showing signs of discomfort and whining sometimes, and needed ”urgent care”, so we called up the regular location who (curtly) told us to go to the emergency vet. No. So we called this one, and got a ”bring her right in!” They were thorough, nice, and got my dog well again. A+<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>Let me start by saying that I never write reviews, but I feel inclined to do so regarding this Banfield office. As anyone in Downtown today (11/30/18) knows, we had mass power outages. All power was restored midday, however at about 330 pm the power at 13th and market went out again (feel free to look it up on SDGE). I promptly called Banfield regarding my 4 pm appointment for my sick cat and let them know that the building was working to get the garage open again so that we could get our cars out and I might be a little late. The guy on the phone assured me that I would be fine if I got there by 4:15 pm so I packed up my sick cat and made my way through the pitch black staircase and pitch black parking garage and once the gate was open rushed over and got dropped off on the corner and ran in. The front desk lady even helped me open the door as I was clearly rushing and struggling with my 20 lb cat. They called back to make sure they could still see Jake and when she was making the call I looked at my phone and it was 4:16. So I walked in at exactly 4:15. She let me know that I just needed to wait for an opening and I said no problem, happy to wait as long as needed. 5 minutes later she looked at me and said they aren’t going to be able to see him because I was late. I told them that I called and explained what was going on and was told that if I made it by 415 then I would be seen and she then told me that I was a minute late so I couldn’t be seen. The sheer lack of empathy and compassion for the situation was insane, escpecially for a company that I would hope to care for my pet with compassion. Plus, the guy who told me I would be fine at 415 just sat there and only said that yes he was the one I talked to. So they are letting a sick cat go another day without being seen over 1 minute on a day when they themselves were even affected by the power outages. I will not be going to Banfield with my pets and business and to be honest, I probably should have read the reviews first anyway. - Amber VanOrman<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80d953570de48611:0x45ee66ba3e9ae298</Gmap_id><response>None</response><user>101586802384850235810< /user>< time>

Brought our dog in because he has been itching non stop due to allergies and has opened up rashes. The vet called us and was trying to get us to pay for a bunch of things we didn't bring him in for. The rashes and open wounds were never even brought up by the vet! I had to ask myself. Finally was able to get a prescription and when we went in they tried to give us a different price than what we were told over the phone. Very shady. Got talked into buying some shampoo that was supposed to help with the itching as well. He's been on the medication for a week and has had the shampoo used on him as well. Absolutely nothing has changed. No relief for our dog. We called back and they had no sympathy. Just wanted more money. If I could give less than one star I would. Take your pet somewhere else.<//review>

I love bringing Julep here and they have been amazing. I was originally at Market Street Vet and saw a different vet every time I went with different opinions. It was extremely frustrating and the final straw there was when they lost my dog's lab work but never called me.
The team here have been nothing but caring and my dog loves coming here. They are available for quick questions over the phone, always giving you options based on costs and recommendations and honestly care about my dog. Every time we walk by she wants to go in. They have fit me in when they were completely booked for an urgent appointment. Dr. Hazarika will call back and talk through any questions you have outside of an appointment and they even let me know of a new vaccine my pup should have because of a new virus going around.
I can't stress enough how nice everyone is there and am so happy to have a partner with a very high maintenance dog.<//Text>

<text>My wife and I had recently rescued an 8 week old puppy and everything was going well. About a week later, he wasn't acting right. He was very lethargic, slept for an extended amount of time, and started whining profusely. After some thought about where to go, I took him to Banfield to get some help. My experience started out well.
It was a Sunday around 3 pm and Banfield had a skeleton staff working. The gentleman whom I started out with was alright. He wasn't very pleasant, but he was very knowledgeable. I was a bit on edge being a first time adopter, and to his benefit, he answered most of my questions. Then his shift apparently ended, and that's when things changed.
The lady that took over, Dr. Friske, started recommending tests to run. I ran them all. Blood, fecal matter, etc. It ended up costing $680. I just wanted to find out what was wrong with my dog.  By this time, my dog had vomited a few times and was swaying, so I was getting really nervous.
She had taken my dog to the back room and I hadn't seem him in over an hour. Another appointment showed up, so Dr. Friske came from the back saw us waiting, and went into another room to help the other patients, purposely avoiding us. We had been there for almost 3 hours at this point. Another 30 minutes later, she came out and walked towards us to tell us what was going on.
She let us know that all of the tests came back normal. Dr. Friske let us know that since everything was 'normal', she assumed he had distemper, which is a very serious disease. Even after we explained that he had had his distemper vaccination, she still believed that it had to have been passed through the mother.  There was no other options given to us. She talked about long term care and that he was going to have seizures for the rest of his life. We were crying in the waiting room. She handed us brochures on care management and walked away.
Another gentleman, that worked there, approached us and asked if we had any questions. He had mentioned that buying bells for our dog would be something we should do so that we could hear when he was having seizures. So there we were, in this waiting room with a 9 week old puppy that we were told is going to suffer immensely and have to be quarantined for the whole of his life. She had encouraged us to take the distemper test for an additional $400. We couldn't financially do it at the time, so we paid the $680 over 3 different cards and left.
We contacted the rescue where we got him and they called us the next day with some options. Since he had 2 rounds of vaccines (distemper included) the head of medical doubted he had distemper. No other dogs in the liter had it either. He recommended another vet to go to and the rescue offered to pay for the requisite tests to rule out distemper.
The second vet gave us 5 different possible causes with distemper being a very slim option.  After the tests came back negative for distemper, we came to the conclusion that he had eaten something that caused his symptoms. He has shown no other symptoms or have we had any other issues. He is now 13 weeks old and is super healthy.
Needless to say we will never step foot in Banfield again, in any location or any state. We feel like they took advantage of us being new to animal ownership and were very unprofessional in their approach. I would recommend you go to any other vet, just as long as you don't go here.<//text>< Resp>

<review>I've been taking my cat here and now my new dog, and was usually satisfied enough. I've always disliked the upselling - some vets are more aggressive than others - but brushed it off. Recently, I took my dog in for a lump on her head. The vet prodded the lump and said she had "no idea" what it could be, which surprised me. No idea? No thought at all of what it might be? I asked if it could be just from her hitting her head, but the vet said she'd never seen anything like it, but that they could take a sample of the cells for testing. I decided instead to go home and see if it got better on it's own, but the next day it was even bigger (maybe from all the poking and pressing on it), so I got scared and brought her back. When I picked her up, I was shocked to discover the charges totaled $324 - I paid $238 due to the "wellness" plan. This included some anti inflammatories, the procedure, the office visit, the lab work, and a $136 charge for "analysis and interpretation". Usually I ask about the charges ahead of time, since Banfield likes to add on extras without discussing them, but this time I was distraught and didn't do that. It's still annoying and frustrating that they don't go over the charges themselves. Three days later I was getting antsy about what the results were, so I looked up the lab it was sent to and discovered that this test sends results back in 1-3 days, not the 3-5 days quoted so I called. They had gotten the results back the next day, although no one bothered to call me. The vet who looked at my pup wasn't there, but another one looked at the results for a minute and said it's probably nothing to worry about. No explanation of what it could be. No analyzing the history or any notes made from the visit.

I decided I'm not going here ever again after my plan runs out. I wouldn't say that Banfield Pet Hospital is evil or negligent, they're more lackadaisical. If they're not pushing for procedures/services you don't really need, they're just ok. They don't really followup or seem very concerned about your pet. There's other, more highly recommended vets in the area, so it's not like this is the only place to go. I would give them three stars for my "meh" rating, but I find it outrageous that they charge $136 to look at some bloodwork, especially when I discovered this is the highest amount out of other vets in the area, so one star it is.

Update:
I talked with the business owner over this situation, and she agreed that I should have been notified of all charges before paying. She said she'd look into this and see if I could get a refund - but she never got back to me.

I met someone at the dog park who was also surprised at extra charges at Banfield, so this seems to be a habit for them. It's too late for me, but heres a tip: file a chargeback with your credit card to get your money back (just be sure to do it within 90 days). You shouldn't have to pay for these surprise charges. This is very unethical and against the terms with the credit card processing. I now go to Bodhi Animal Hospital in North Park, and they review charges BEFORE they render care, so I'm fully informed.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

So I have a cat, he was feeling very bad he slept all day didnt eat and drink little bit water
When I came here, I was waiting for doctor for hour.

This doctor here probably have a degree in Drama ART

She said that my cat can't pee because its something stuck there and he sofer.
She said my cat need emergency(but they closing so they wont do that) or medication cost $570.

She sounds like she not sure because she didn't actually check it. She trying persuade us with stupid arguments. SHE HOLDING THE DOOR and saying my cat will die or will be in horrible pain.
She gave us sign paper that we refuse medication and it can let death.

You know what,,, my cat pee right when we come home and now he feel better.

DOCTOR make me feel horrible and angry becouse she lie to us.

<Review>I've been taking my baby kitten here since we got him and until this visit I was very happy with all the staff and the vets, we signed up for the most expensive kitten wellness plan and figured that would have us covered.

Today we brought our kitten in because he had been acting lethargic and weak and we were incredibly worried about him. The vet was lovely as usual and very good with our kitten and said it could be an infection or a string stuck in his bowels (without any indigestion, diarrhea, vomiting, lack of appetite or stomach pain?) and the vet tech preceded to try to convince us to get $160 worth of blood work and also a $250 x ray for something he clearly didn't have.

We decided to get him the antibiotics they recommended and see if they helped before dropping $200 on blood work. The rest of our visit she proceeded to shame us and make us feel guilty for waiting to do the blood work. She told the other employee that we weren't getting the recommended tests quite loudly in the waiting area.

I get the feeling that they scare most people into dropping thousands of dollars into tests before even getting to the treatment. I've never experienced these hard selling tactics at a vet before(maybe I've just had good luck before this) and I think preying on people's devoted love for their pets is disturbing and vile.<//Review>< Pics>

In and Out in about 10mins max. That’s including driving to appropriate area for your disposal and checking out. Been here 3 times, so far with rocks and lumber. No wait times (2 exit scales). Went there teo friday mornings and one afternoon.</Text>

It's a refuse disposal site. What can be said about a dump...
The second scale house has made it more efficient on the outbound weigh out.<//Review>

There is no reason why it should take the employees in the booth so long to process payments and paperwork. They literally have one job. There is always an hour+ wait to get out of this place.  Recology in SF never has a line because it takes less then 3 minutes to get weighed and process credit card payments. These people either need to create a batter process or get better employees.</Text>

Irritating wait in line. They need an Express lane for dumps under or at 1000lbs.
I like their ability to recycle large items, and old mattresses. The effort to recycle is great.
But sense of taking 5 minutes to dump 120 lbs, and wait behind 20-30 trucks for over an hour was a bit taxing< /Text>

< Review>
I usually go later, early afternoon, and lines going in are non-existent. Lines going out are slower, 5-10 minutes or more.

I like the basic garbage area, it's all concrete, covered building, easy in and out.

The yard waste area is round the corner of concrete area. Dirtier, I even got an item in my tire, ending getting a flat. No biggie though.

All and all, great place.</Review>

I Have been using Delvin recycle for a long time And I never had any problem with any person in the office until today with the operator named VeronicaM2 she gave me the form to sign and I  did,  and  I returned the form to her which it's normal and she said the yellow copy  it"s yours i said ok, and she said again "then get it" . when i Told her that was part of her job she started to scream. Every day I gave papers to my customer to sign and after they signed I get papers back and remove the yellow copy and  returned  to customer again .  I think she is in the wrong place or she did not received a training to do the work she is doing,  not professional<//Review>

This place is a joke. It is expensive and it takes forever to pay and get out of there.
Spent a half hour waiting to pay.

Very loud inside.  Cavernous with loud music. Sat outside. Beer was good but the food was o.k. The carnitas could have used more sauce. All of our dishes came out lukewarm to cold. Throughout the meal we had 3 different waiters approach us minutes from one another asking if everything was ok, did we need anything, and how was the food. We were told when we arrived each table had an hour or do to eat and leave. Maybe this was the hint. Also, it was cold outside. They need to provide heaters. Maybe either time they'll get this dialed in.< /Text>

Brentwood Craft and Beer is top notch. It has a great selection of beer to choose from. Family is welcome. We took our 7 year with us and he had a good time. There are things to do for kids. Lots of tvs with various sports being featured and the Owner Joey and his wife are very professional. Its a great place to unwind after a long work week and at the time its affordable.<//review>

<review>Decent new place!

I think it has a ways to go on it feeling complete, lived in, and comfortable, but on the right track for just opening recently.

Seems to attract an older crowd.

Good selection of beer, cider, wine, and snacks.

Nice to have some bomb giant pretzels!<//review>< Pics>

<Name>Connor Peck<//Name><time>1559419048262<//time><Text>Great spot with lots of TVs and tables. Really like their selection of beer and they have a good assortment of snacks.  After my first round they tapped Pliny the Elder which was amazing. My kids had the pretzel which was as big as their head. Also noticed they had some wine I think. So glad there's finally a tap room downtown we can go to with kids.<//Text><gmapID>0x808fffdb27607185:0x3c2c6d23d6bf0775< /gmapID>< pictures>

When I initially spoke with Jorge inquiring about a 2018 Honda Civic EX-T he gave me a verbal quote over the phone, out the door. I scheduled an appointment with him the following day and met with his co-worker Diego. Diego was courteous and initiated the selling process without any pressure or issues. Mark then followed up the deal with financing and was thorough and transparent. Overall my experience with Car Pros of El Monte was exceptional from start to finish. The salespeople are professional and do not try to upsell on other products that are unnecessary. I have purchase many cars in the past from other dealerships over the years, and Car Pros of El Monte has surpassed them all.< /Text>

Don’t waste your time trying the service department here. It is 5 min from my home but after my recent experiences, I’d rather drive further if I can get good customer service. Appointment or not, I have just sat in my car for over half an hour just to have someone talk to me to get my car serviced. A lot of waste of time and very frustrating, yet no proactivity from employees. Maybe it’s the new management because this used to not be a problem back when it was El Monte Honda or Nelson honda. All I can say is I’ll not be trying me chances here again.</Review>

Purchased a car from this dealership about a month ago. On the contract, it states that the total amount already included registration fee and license fee. Today, I received a vehicle registration renewal notice from DMV. DMV wants me to pay another $314 for license and registration.  Just wondering where my registration and license fee goes?  Overall, not a good experience.<//text>

I asked if I can use the restroom and he said no I had to wait in the car. So I did. He then asked my reason for coming which I told him. After he asked me to get out of my car and take a picture of the vin number of my car and the part I needed to fix and walk over to parts and accessories department. I thought he was joking. I repeated what he had told me and yes he made me get out, take a picture of the vin number and the part I needed to get fix and go over to parts and accessories dep. once inside I spoke with Juan regarding my situation both him and another lady that worked there were both shocked. Jared then came back and said “ I need your keys to move your car”. Once he came back to return my keys he said “ so are you going to fix it or no”. I couldn’t believe it.

<review>Just bought a car from there yesterday. One of the best experiences I have had. I pre negotiated a deal, and they gave me the exact deal we had discussed. They were professional, reliable, and most importantly, trust worthy! Thank you so much to Jenny for being so kind and making my first car purchase a good one. Also, the environment is welcoming due to the music, which makes the experience more comfortable and enjoyable. I hope to be purchasing future cars here!< /review>< Pictures>

I sold my old car and was search for a new SUV in market.   I  found my experience with Honda is a  pleasant one when I stopped by,  Their sales staff James was  very helpful and knowledge. So It leads me to select the Honda CRV over other  brands such as Toyota/Nissan/Hyundai/Mazda.   The negotiation process is smooth and plenty of stocks to choice from as far af trim goes.  This dealership deserves a good recommendation for their services and quality.  5 star from me!<//Text>

< review>
My purchase experience of our 2020 Civic Hatchback EX this past January 2020 was excellent.  Car Pros staff provided excellent pricing over the phone and made the whole acquisition process extremely easy.  There were no surprises when I showed up at the dealership.  Neither the sales staff nor the finance officer were aggressive with the usual add-ons pressure.  Everyone I spoke to was friendly and easy to chat with.  I referred a friend in February and they also purchased a 2020 Civic LX based on my positive experience, referral and competitive pricing.

I recently returned for my first service.  Jonathan Vera my service consultant was great to work with especially during the pandemic.  Personable and honest.  He made my first Civic A1 service at Car Pros Honda easy.  The service was completed fairly quickly as I waited at the dealership.   Jonathan was very accommodating when delivering my car back to me.  The Car Pros Honda dealership is not the 1st nor 2nd closest to my house, but after this visit I will continue to bring my car to their dealership as a result of this positive experience.

My purchase experience was great and now my 1st service experience was great as well.  I highly recommend them.</review>

Very bad experience. I was baited in with a price below what that car was actually going for. They told me a car was $5,000 less than an actually was. Also ran my credit multiple times hitting me for over 75 points on my credit score. Shady practices! Not recommended!<//text>

< review>
I called Honda and spoke to a woman and explained to her my cars bluetooth was not working and wanted to make an appointment to check it out. She set up an appointment and I asked her if there was going to be a fee. She said no but if they have to do a further check it would be about 140-170 (cant remember the actual price she stated) I said okay thats fine. The day of my appointment my dad took in my car because I had to work. He got there the inspected the car for scratches and stuff and made my dad sign. My dad signed then left. He got a call saying it was going to be 270 for the work and he said yes thats fine. He called me to let me know and from what he said they were going to fix it and it was going to be 270. When he picked up the car he paid the man the 270. Then the guy gave him a paper with a list of issues the car had that they ran. My dad said how would it all be and said it was about 2000. He said not right now since times are hard due to COVID-19. I went to my dad to pick up my car and when I tried the Bluetooth it didn't work. It was the exact same thing how it was. The next day I called and told them that it still didn't work but they charged my dad. The guy said the charge was to check it. I told him I was told it was going to be around 140-170 to check it. He said to go in person to receive a refund for the difference. I went in the next day and he said since it was paid via credit card we had to wait to receive a check. Basically a waste of time for me to go in person for something I could had been told over the phone. He said about a week I should receive the check. A month passed and still nothing. I had to call again and go in person to resolve this. It was a pain. And my cars bluetooth system is still not fixed because they now said it will cost almost 3000 to fix. NOT HELPFUL AT ALL</review>

This review is long overdue, but we were impressed from the moment my wife and I walked in the door.

My wife was looking for a gently used Honda Civic, one with low miles, a good price and in blue (the color being the most important for my wife). We found exactly what we wanted at Car Pros Honda El Monte.

From the first phone call with Jesus, then to the dealership with Mark, to Alberto, to Sergio, everyone was genuinely nice, professional, courteous and treated us like family. We truly enjoyed meeting and talking with everyone.

We could not have asked for a better car buying experience!

Even after the sale when we needed some additional accessories, the service was excellent!</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>This was the best car buying experience of my life. I purchased a Honda Odyssey. El Monte Honda had so many options, it was in the garage so we weren't out in the heat.  Paperwork went nice and smooth. The majority of the time spent was playing with the features Odyssey has to offer. Thank you Will, Jose, and Tony for making it such a great buying experience.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

This place was great until.... I got my car serviced it all went down hill even though I am under warranty I told them my concern and it seems like they don’t want to hear me or deal with me. I m a single mom and I depend on my car to drive us around from school and work and it seems like my car is giving issues that have to be fixed but this dealer tells me they can’t fix it. They heard my concerns and my issues but turn around and walk the other way even the manager Scott of service department has said he doesn’t want to do anything so I have to take my matters into my own hands. So sad for the dealership.</Text>

<Review>I was calling parts and I was put on hold for 5 to 6 minutes. The on hold music and announcements were so annoying they kept on having static it hurt my ears. I will never call these people again they are so rude And not very customer oriented. I’d rather go to Sierra Honda even if it’s further from me. Management should listen and fire these parts people they are rude and not people oriented. Listen folks don’t come here if you want to be treated respectfully.< /Review>< Pictures>

This is my first time at this location. The service I received from Juan is more than I expected. Very professional and accommodating. Patiently explained the maintenance my vehicle would be receiving and answered all my questions . Since it was my first time here, he kindly showed me the layout of the place; waiting areas, restrooms and how to exit in my vehicle when I was ready to leave the dealership. Some don't realize how important those little details are when you're not yet familiar with the surroundings. Well kept dealership. Clean. Nicely set up. Shuttle home is available. Great first time experience. I highly recommend an appointment, especially on the weekends.< /Text>

I waited kind of last minute to get an oil change before a long road trip. And I came to the service center around 5:15 without an appointment. The staff at the service center was able to finish servicing my car just before closing, so I'm pretty happy they didn't turn me away and went the extra mile to get the oil change done before they closed up.< /Text>

<Text>Location is easy to get to and they have big signs you can’t miss which lead you to their service area. They have an express lane and one for appointments. I was attended to quickly and everyone was very polite. The first time I came here was early in the morning before I went into work. Luckily they have that shuttle service and i was able to use it to get to work on time. This time around my appointment was at 1245pm and I was told my car (went in for oil change + multi-point inspection) would be ready by around 2. They ended up taking longer, until 3, but I wasn’t in a rush and had brought things to work on while I waited. They have a nice little waiting area with a TV and you can actually change the channel. They also provide free coffee. The guy who attended me, Chris, was nice and didn’t try to push any other service on me which I really appreciate. The other workers seemed on top of their stuff and I got this feeling they work as a team.< /Text>< Time>

Excellent Service Honda in El Monte.  Ryan Perez did professional service pointing out all that was needed and pointed all the savings with the coupons specials for the maintenance for the vehicle.  I Highly recommend  El MONTE Honda right off the 10 freeway - Exit Peck Rd N.< /text>

<review>The "manager" or "supervisor" the original sales guy introduced me to had no interest in speaking with me. I ended up getting a fantastic deal at the Glendale Honda dealership where I bought my 2019 Honda Odyssey. I highly recommend the Glendale Honda dealership.< /review>< Pics>

I've bought my car here and I get my car serviced here regularly.  When I had an issue with my service in the past the Client care manager Kendra Chavez went above and beyond and made it right for me. I really appreciate that kind of service and commitment to the customers. Nick Hernandez serviced my car today and it was perfect service.  Highly recommend this place.</text>

<user_id>105985591621103080488</user_id><text>Amazing team! Walked in without a car and walked out with a car. And made friends along the way. Talked basically to employees from all departments, and everyone came to say hi. Ended up getting a newer car than I was planning on, but hey they're good sales people and I am very happy with my car :)
Just like in every other sales business they try to make some bucks, but if you go prepared and know what you're talking about then they won't try to make too much off of the purchase and just give you what you asked for.
Special thanks to Marilyn who was super cool on the phone and was the reason why I came in. A big thanks also to Jeff Lee, who stood with me the entire time and answered all my questions or found someone that can help me. Super nice and funny. Highly recommend that you find Jeff Lee. He will take care of you. Thanks also to Jesus Silva, Brett Moore, Flavio, and Sergio Rodriguez who helped me purchasing the car. Last but not least thanks to Charlie Benedict with whom I had a great time bonding over our mutual background and talking about good old Germany.
Thanks to everyone else I talked to. Will recommend to friends.<//text><Resp>None<//Resp><time>1549732847207<//time>< gmapID>

<Review>I can’t remember if the mans name is Brett, but the the gentleman that came to my house to replace my air bags was very nice. He got the job done in a timely manner. I’m always on the go and for Honda to send out someone to my house and make sure my airbags are replace was great!! My family and myself appreciated it!!
Thanks Honda!!!</Review>< name>

Vehicle service was fine. I received a text soon after I dropped off the vehicle and when the service was complete. However, when I arrived I informed the young man that my trunk bottom was not functioning. He tested it and told me he would take note of that but informed me that the service might need to be scheduled for another time. When I picked up my vehicle, I inquired with the advisor who told me there were no notes regarding trunk button and suggested I call to schedule the service. I asked him if he can help me schedule that since I was there and he suggested I call to schedule. I’m not sure why a service advisor could not provide a customer assistance scheduling service considering I was at the service department. I figure it was the Honda location protocol. While I accepted that the dilemma with my non functioning trunk button could not be addressed at that visit, I felt there wasn’t any effort to try to help me get it scheduled for another date and/or time at the very least. My vehicle was serviced as scheduled for what I was there and that part of my experience was fine. Thank you.</text>

I went in to El Monte Honda today to the parts department, and try to order a part for my 99 si civic, but apparently YOU CAN NOT ORDER ANY PARTS IF YOU DON'T HAVE A ACCOUNT OR THE VIN #. WHY ?!?!??!?!? MAKES NO SENSE !!!!
The parts guy with the kia polo ask If i purchase the 99 si there ? I said no. Then he said we can't help you then.
So I left and went to norm reeves honda on Azusa and the kid that was 24yr help me with my order with no vin#.
El monte honda is a JOKE and your customer service is TRASH !!!!!</Text>

Overall Honda service experience was ok. Nothing great or special. Just got what I needed with a long wait period. Oil change + recall (some software update) took over 5 hours when originally quote 1-3 hour wait. There was a shuttle that took me home which was nice.< /text>

I will be providing screenshots soon of Honda acknowledging that they are having "tire/hubcaps"issue and they do not have a resolution. I repeat do no buy a HONDA CIVIC it'll start making a loud noise and embarrass you and they will not fix the issue and you will be left with a car with loud squeezy/rattling noise. Even American Honda said that I just have to wait until they find a solution, if they find one. Car Pros Honda El Monte knows about this issue and they're not letting the consumer know and this is why they get 0 Stars.</Review>

Gabriel was an amazing help. He was up front about everything and always let’s us know if there is anything else before it’s done. Gabriel provides the best customer service at this site. I always recommend him when someone asks about getting service on their Honda. Thank you, Gabriel for always smiling and being such a Helpful Honda guy.<//Review>

Dropped off my car at 2pm, the guy said it will take about an hour and half to do the service, and they will call me when it’s ready. Got the call at 3:40pm said it’s ready. Later found out, they sent me an email at 3 o’clock said the car was ready to pick up. Would be very appropriate if they could call me right away instead waited extra 40 minutes there.<//Review>

I been looking for a car for about two weeks. And my choices were really narrowed down. It was between a Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. I tried to get the Camry first but it was such a hassle. They didn’t want to give me the car just because they thought I couldn’t pay the monthly payment. I told them I can easily pay it and I have excellent credit so I didn’t see why they couldn’t help me. I got frustrated so I went back to my first choice the Accord. I just randomly went to the Honda across the street. And saw the accord I wanted and I love it. Everything went smooth and everyone was very helpful. I left with a brand new car. Thank you very much< /review>

5 stars for Honda!! They had an excellent over the top costumer service. The salesman that was helping me found the right car for me,which I fell in love with. I thought it would take a very long time but it was really quick and that another thing I liked about my visit. They also worked with me to fit my income. Thanks for my brand new car!</review>

Cesar was very helpful when explaining the new 2019 Honda Civic that I wanted and helped negotiate the best possible price. El Monte Honda is a great place for someone to purchase a car whether you are a first time buyer like myself or if you are a part of the Honda Family. It is a very welcoming place with great staff who take pleasure in helping their customers.< /Review>

< Review>
I bought a certified pre-owned Honda Accord at this dealership yesterday. William greeted me upon arrival and patiently test-drove three cars with me. He answered all my questions and made the process a lot easier with his engaging personality and know-how. I never felt pressured to buy and everyone was very friendly and patient with me as I made my decision. I would definitely recommend El Monte Honda to anyone looking for a car.< /Review>

Juan helped immediately when I arrived at the service department.  He reviewed the maintenance plan for my car and the approximate cost!  His knowledge about the past history helped to decide plan of action.  I also treasure the text communication from Juan in welcoming me to the service dept.  The quality of service gave me relief that he knew my history with the care and specifically told me how long I will need to wait for completion. “Thank you so much for being at the service dept, “ Juan!!<//review>

Great experience! I bought my first new car here as a newly college grad and everyone was so helpful answering all my questions. I did not know what I want at first but I found the car that fit my budget and I got to test drive :) Thank you so much Honda of El Monte.</text>

I was very disappointed with this dealer once again. The gentleman that helped me was not accommodating, was not helpful and at the end did not know or lied to me. I will be leaving an extensive, exact review of my experience with this location on yelp and other social media do people know what to expect and to be educated before coming to this dealership. I will also be writing a letter to corporate office.</text>

What made my experience so AWESOME was my salesman William!
He was soo informative, and made everything easy to understand. Not to mention, how at ease he made me feel when I didn't know exactly what I wanted. He took his time and never made me feel rushed. I would definitely recommend sending my friends and family to Will and the El Monte Honda dealership! Thank you guys.</text>< pics>

El Monte Honda was attentive and quick to help me try many models and trims for the best fit.  I have back issues and I’m rather tall, so this meant trying something like 10 different cars. I’m very happy with the car I finally settled on.< /Text>

This is good news if you live far 15 plus miles away and you want a courtesy shuttle ride.  The driver tells me they drive 15 to 30 miles away for shuttle service.  They only have 1 shuttle and when they drive farthest distance first, those living close will be held hostage in the car for 40 to 50 minutes in my case.  Apparently they have rules for female customers to be dropped off first if only guys are in the car.  That is a great policy.  But I was the 2nd person dropped off and 50+ minute drive for my 3 miles away drop off seems too much.  If they want to do these long distance drop off use the back up car.  They must have a back up shuttle right?  This doesn't make sense to hold people hostage for this long.  Mixed thoughts on this.  Service can be better!

BTW.  Car service itself was good.< /review>

El Monte Honda was a great experience and had helpful employees. I went in for an oil and filter change for my car. After the service, Ryan went over the car inspection details. He was nice and polite, I would definitely come back.<//Review>

<Text>I would have chosen no stars if I could have. I just went for a oil change and showed up early so I wouldn't have a long wait time. I sat waiting for someone to assist me for 20 min. It was relatively empty while the customer service personnel were standing around talking. 4 in total. It's a shame as I drive from Alhambra to El Monte because they were very good about a year ago. I'd advise people to try another service dealership.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80c2d0b1f0f5b3d3:0x82f32f5eabc29a09</gmapID></record>

Unfortunately I could not get the car I wanted due to my credit/ trade in with negative equity BUT they helped me get a brand new car and explained everything to me. Martin answered all of my questions and they were flexible with what I could pay. I’m happy with my purchase and excited to do business with them again after my lease is over.</review>

This is the third time I purchase a car here and definitely my best experience by far. It was pretty quick and I went home with the car I wanted. I will continue recommending friends and family.<//review>

I went in without any knowledge of what I wanted to get. Fernando Quintanar walked me through what would be my best deal. He made an otherwise frightening experience very much tolerable and worked with me to get the best deal possible. I will be recommending this place to everyone! Thank you, El Monte Honda.<//text>

<text>They took care of me and addressed concerns I had but hadn’t voice without me asking! I felt like my car went to get her physical done. That’s the kind of service that makes me come back. And Juan Montes is really easy to talk to and when I ask question he is very patient in answering them and using terms I can understand. He even remembered me from last time and asked me about concerns I had last time!! It felt like I had a personal service adviser that knows my car better than I do which is a really reassuring feeling to have when you drive as much as I do.<//text><rate>5< /rate>< response>

I come here for all my car’s service needs. Everyone here is awesome, but Gabriel P. and Ken O. are top notch. Both of them are very personable, explain and answer any questions I have in detail, and work to ensure that I and others (from what I’ve seen) are pleased with everything.

Thank you!<//text>

Great friendly service Technicians but slow. What is the point of having an appointment if my car isn’t going to be worked on at that time. The first time I came spent 2 hours getting an oil change. Second time around took an hour and a half. An oil change at most places doesn’t take more than 30 mins. They lag and get to the cars at whatever time not at the priority of appointments. I find it stupid to make an appointment if my car is still going to take forever to be seen 🙄.< /review>

My experience at El Monte Honda was positive. I have no problem with my request. I took pre-purchased headlight bulb for replacement. I was immediatley attended too and to my surprise my airbags were also replaced for a second time due to a recall..Thank You El Monte Honda.

<review>Make sure you compare their service price with other Honda dealerships. Change my car battery on Sep 6 2019, and it's 25 bucks more than other Honda service. When they finished the job, I tried to use the coupon from thier website and got rejected. Advisor said it was to late to apply any more coupons for this time service. Life taught me a lesson today!<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Yesterday my boyfriend and I went into Honda in need of a new car. We were helped out by Brandon who was determined to help us get a car that is a good fit for us. We kept running into some problems with the bank but that didn’t stop Brandon, he gave us every option he had until we were all happy and found us the perfect car and in our price range. Unlike Toyota. We went to Toyota and they gave us one car option and no reason to why we could not pick any other car. But with Brandon and Mario’s and the other good help with the Honda team, we were able to leave happy and with a amazing car.< /text>

I was told one of the cause might be over maintenance mileage. He told me not to worry, the mechanic tech will do a diagnostic test and perform oil change. I drop  off the key and come back around 3pm, but it’s a good thing that it got done earlier around 1pm because I needed the car before 3pm. The diagnostic test came out, he informed me the reason for the problem with my car was low psi on my tires , so they put air pressure it back to standard.

My service advisor Andy Vuong is excellent!  He knew that I had a family emergency, he helped by getting my car done super fast in a extremely busy Sat morning.  He also gave true opinion on what type of service is needed.  It’s hard to find such a great service advisor.  Thanks Andy!</review>

<Review>I was in the market for a new car after driving my 2004 civic for 14 years. I called El Monte Honda to price out a new civic hatchback, a fit, and a Honda Accord hybrid. I spoke with the sales manager Albert and Victor, one of the product specialists before coming down and they told me based on what I said I was looking for (dependability and affordability similar to my civic and good gas mileage) that maybe I should read up on the brand new 2019 insight, which seems positioned as a hybrid closer to the civic in cost then the accord. Well timing was excellent because Albert told me As of that day the insight was available and it’s price point was closer to civic hatchback.  I went down, test drove the ex model (they had a touring version too), and it had a ton of awesome features and great mileage at a very solid price of about 25k. I took it home yesterday and the whole experience was easy and painless. They even let me leave my 2004 civic in their lot until I could come back to pick it up the next day. Great friendly staff, very true to their quoted price and didn’t try to upsell me. Actually listened to my needs budget and desires and then helped me choose what worked best with my budget and tastes. I will return for the next Honda in 15 years! Thanks Victor and Albert and Chris!< /Review>< Pictures>

The original after-sales service is not good!  It's getting worse.  The most basic things like car washing are cut out.  But it does n’t matter if it ’s washed before, it ’s not so clean.</review>

<review>From scheduling my appointment, ordering the parts needed, shuttle service and completion of repair, this has been a very smooth and pleasant experience.  I live relatively close to another Honda dealership, but the utmost care, customer service and professionalism demonstrated here are all the reasons why I’ll frequent El Monte Honda again.  Thanks Pink and Juan!<//review></record></dataset><record>

Service very good but waiting long times. My car has oil changed. Before I checked oil life is 40%.After oil changed it's still 40%.I try set up again but it's still 40%.What can I do? Could you help me to set up back oil life 100%.<//review>

<text>I am an owner of a brand new Honda Civic thanks to the help of Marci Sari! Highly recommend Marci if you are car shopping here.

She was very friendly and personable, making small talk while also talking me through the many features of the car. With all the new tech in these cars it can be overwhelming but Marci walked me through the Honda Sense features, answering any questions I had, and even made sure I tried out the "brake hold" feature myself (since that was one thing I had the most questions about).

I appreciated having a patient employee who didn't try to oversell things and she seemed like a genuine individual who was in the business to help others.

Not a paid review, just very happy with the service and want others to have the same experience with Marci!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c2d0b1f0f5b3d3:0x82f32f5eabc29a09<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Mark Aguirre did a very good job in making my 2017 civic ex lease possible and truly a smooth process from start to finish. Mark made it really easy for me.  I’ll recommend him to my family and friends.  Can’t thank him enough.<//review>

Sale and the manager are vary nice and patience. I spent quiet a lot of time looking through different Cars but the salesman really helped me through every single details. I feel like the processes were long and time consuming but me and my friend had a great time while waiting. They really tried helping me on getting the price l wanted, and so I believe we made a pretty good deal at the end of the day.<//review>

<Review>I go here to get my Honda’s done. Good quality work. While good waiting services they obviously do not compare to longo down the street. When my cars were new I always came here. But lately their prices are bothering me. I was charged once 90 dollars labor to put in a gas cap. The cap cost 20 bucks.
I still go because I depend on them to correctly diagnose my car and if I feel the price is right make pay. However they are just too expensive, especially when they start listing more than one thing. I usually do the simple stuff myself. Medium I leave to them. Anything way to expensive I take toy local shop that more often that not does it for HALF THE PRICE and HONDA GENUINE PARTS.

It’s frustrating. I really depend and trust their work on my car. But the price is a heavy burden I just cannot cope with sometimes.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2d0b1f0f5b3d3:0x82f32f5eabc29a09<//GmapID></record>

I have bought from Penske, as well as metro Honda, but never have I ever left a dealership as happy and completely satisfied as I was yesterday when I left  EL MONTE HONDA.
Product specialist  Victor Villalpando was amazing, extremely respectful, as other salesman completely ignored me, Victor made us feel comfortable and his main focus. Mario in financial rocked, extremely professional. I recommend my friends and family any day.</text>

I went in for an oil & filter change, and a tire rotation. I got the oil and filter change but i did not want to spend 40 dollars on the tire rotation. The service was quick and they were also able to fix the broken gear shift button because it was in stock. I appreciated that they fixed what I was there for quickly, eventhough the girl whom I spoke with to set up the appointment somehow did not log my appointment in correctly.<//Review>

< Review>
Today, I got a text from El Monte Honda to give a review on Honda and their service. All I can say is they are AMAZING! From my father to his brother and most of their children we are a Honda Family. Great cars, great gas mileage, while remaining stylish, but that is not why I am taking the time to write this review. HONDA/EL MONTE HONDA, has an airbag recall on specific Honda. Honds has went over and above to reach out to their customers. They not only sent mailers, they literally had someone come to my home several time. It was so unbelievable I had to call Honda to confirm. I posted it on our neighborhood Nextdoor website and my neighbors said Honda did the same for them. Now that is real Customer Service! When we finally accepted that this was true and not a hoax, a Honda representative can to our home checked our airbag to make sure my family was safe. I am happy to report that our airbags were fine, but still amazed with Honda's diligence to keep our family safe. Thank  El Monte Honda!<//Review>

<text>Had such a great experience here at El Monte Honda. Thank you to Edgar, Brett, and Mario for their amazing customer service.

El Monte Honda’s service manager, Tim Smith, has always taken good care of my Accord and been very observant to how it is running. He is able to communicate to me what is necessary to keep it running smoothly and has let me know what services will be necessary in the future so I will be prepared.< /review>

I arrived early in the morning like I was told by Gabriel the Service Tech. I’m sorry but don’t remember or recall Gabriel’s  last name.
I know and feel very satisfied knowing that I am in good hands and that all my concerns will be handled at the end of the day.
I would like to thank you for a job well done.
Gabriel deserves a pay raise, he’s a keeper.</text>

I brought my car in for its scheduled maintenance - easy to set an appointment online and my service advisor Manny remembered me from a previous visit. I dropped my car off and came back after work to get it, but it was actually done an hour after I had left it! Will be back for my next service.< /Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>The integrity of sales is low.  The sales almost make a mistake that cost me to pay extra 60 dollars.  As a customer, I was so smart to found out by myself.  Btw, I feel got ripped off by being offered extra service that cost me 170 dollars more.  I wasn't expect that.  Doing research data online strongly advise or otherwise you will be scammed again.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Nelson Honda has great quality service, I showed up with no appointment and they serviced my car and kept their word on returning it to me on the said time. There is coffee inside and water the waiting area feels like a home environment. I enjoy taking my car to Nelson honda.</review>

Wasted my time negotiating. As soon as Hondas arrive new, Honda dealers add on mud flaps, weather mats, and alarm system raising the price by about $1,300. This is installed on all cars to increase price. Noticed at multiple dealerships. Buy used from private party.<//Text>

<Review>I'm having a problem with their service . Thay said they were charging me 130 for diagnostics now they asking for more time to diagnose beacause they can't find the problem I don't see why that is my fault. So now they want me to pay an extra 230$ so now the diagnostics that was costing me 130$ is up to 360$ it is completely unacceptable and they still have not found the problem. I will definitely not be paying another dime towards diagnostics. I need the car repaired by someone who knows what they are doing. I can't be paying for someone to just be Messing with it with no answer as to what the problem is or what is going to need repair.</Review>< pics>

Not sure if I want to give one star, or five stars because if I didn't have such a terrible experience I wouldn't have decided to walk out the door and found a deal on a brand spanking new Toyota 86 of my dreams.

I will pay for good service and fairness over a good deal. But after the interaction I had with GoateeSaver(TM) I simply did not want to give my business here.<//Text>

Great experience at this dealership. I had been to a couple previously and the customer service was rude and unprofessional. I also don't appreciate pushy salespeople, and I did not experience that here at all. I like that the environment is kind and calm and they are honest with you and work with you to get what you want.< /Text>

Manuel Montoya was very helpful, friendly, and accommodating.  Making repair or even recall experience waiting time more tolerable.  Gave you an update about what's going on with your car every 20 minutes or so via email.
👍good job👍<//review>

Staff was busy but still friendly.  I went in for 2 recalls on my 2001 civic and tbh was hesitant for the fact that it's an older car and I felt a bit out of place but I was helped with urgency and thanks to manny and the friendly staff at honda I got over that feeling quickly ... one of the recalls is the takata air bags and my vehicle was in a accident before I bought it so they deployed already... that being said they didn't do anything to them which is great concern to me but I trust that they wouldn't jeopardize the safety concern and I will just consider there expertise in the situation.   Even thobi really wish they would have atleast taken out the bags and sealed the dash but other than that amazing< /review>

Updated: 2019 - Vehicle Repainted Twice
As friendly as the representatives were at the time I purchased the vehicle, I had 2 significant problems that were dismissed.
1. Name of account holder was incorrect, I contacted the dealership dozens of times by phone and email and in person requesting a correction. Was told several times the request was being processed and to check back within 3-5 days. Unfortunately they never corrected the problem.
2. The paint on my vehicle began to oxidize after 2 years. Fortunately this was not an isolated case and there was a recall for oxidized paint on a wide range of Honda models. I spent 2 years contacting this dealership dozens of times, sent photographs and spoke to several managers. When they finally painted the vehicle, it took over 1 month and I was not provided with a rental car. There were a lot of problems, paint on windows, broken interior door handles, cracked seals. The greatest issue was the recall didn't cover re-painting the entire vehicle. I spent a month trying to get the issues corrected and ended up giving up.
- - - - - -
2 years after the Honda Civic was repainted, the paint on the hood began to peel. Paint on the roof began to oxidize. Returned the vehicle to be painted once again. This time the vehicle was returned with new scratches and dents. After numerous calls and emails to the rep and the service center throughout the span of 3 months.. no response. I eventually gave up.</text>

The service department is professional and prompt with appointments and very reasonable with repair and maintenance times. They work hard to identify and rectify problems you may have and never try to upsell you on unnecessary services. Gabriel is my go to person for years. I drive out from Sherman Oaks to El Monte for my service needs because they are worth the drive.</Text>

< review>
I had recently went to a shop American tire depot since I had warranty on my tires and they let me know my axles were going bad. I didn’t allow the repairs since I only go to Honda for major service. At this time I also needed an oil change. I made my appointment and went in. I spoke to Chris and when I let him know my concern for my axles he let me know I don’t have extended warranty with Honda. Which I was so confused since I knew I did. I continued with my oil change and left my car.  Right after I left I called my warranty and they told me that I still have a warranty til 2020. So I called Chris back and let him know. He said I would have to make another appointment since it would take hours to do. Before I left the first time I let him know I would be picking my car up at 530pm. I dropped it off at 830am so by taking hours, Honda had more than enough time to check. I was very displeased with my service. For my pick up I was helped by someone else and I let him know my concerns too and if anything was mentioned and he said no. I really hope nothing is wrong with my axles. Honda let me drive off the lot.</review>

I pass this stretch of the freeway quite often. Noticed the car dealership, and thought “note to self in need of a car remember this”.
Out this past Sunday 01/06/2019 my daughter was interested in a Honda. We pulled in and met the nicest gentleman named Alberto Hollingsworth. We introduced ourselves and let him know what we were interested in.
He listened and offered feedback, brought a car to us so my daughter could test drive. All the while during the test drive Alberto was informative about the features, he definitely knew the car and his person/vibe is so awesome. Alberto is the nicest, most informative with a compassionate spirit it was a very wonderful experience spending our Sunday with him. It was a long day but so worth it, Alberto worked really hard to make us all happy especially my daughter who is absolutely thrilled with her new car a Honda Civic.
If you’re interested in Honda definitely my recommendation is to go to El Monte Honda and please ask for Alberto!

<Review>It’s a good experience in El Monte Honda. Compare with other locations, waiting time is much less and waiting room is decent and comfortable. I would like to come back again.</Review></record></dataset><record>

At first I was upset because I had an 8:00 appt but the service guy was doing who knows what. I waited for 15 mins and asked who was suppose to help. The service person came out and was very apologetic. I had to wait for the car and he promised it would be 1 1/2 hrs. He got the work done in an hour and was out of there. Thanks El Monte Honda<//Text>

<text>The service department is professional and prompt with appointments and very reasonable with repair and maintenance times. They work hard to identify and rectify problems you may have and never try to upsell you on unnecessary services. Gabriel is my go to person for years. I drive out from Sherman Oaks to El Monte for my service needs because they are worth the drive.< /text>< pictures>

< review>
I had recently went to a shop American tire depot since I had warranty on my tires and they let me know my axles were going bad. I didn’t allow the repairs since I only go to Honda for major service. At this time I also needed an oil change. I made my appointment and went in. I spoke to Chris and when I let him know my concern for my axles he let me know I don’t have extended warranty with Honda. Which I was so confused since I knew I did. I continued with my oil change and left my car.  Right after I left I called my warranty and they told me that I still have a warranty til 2020. So I called Chris back and let him know. He said I would have to make another appointment since it would take hours to do. Before I left the first time I let him know I would be picking my car up at 530pm. I dropped it off at 830am so by taking hours, Honda had more than enough time to check. I was very displeased with my service. For my pick up I was helped by someone else and I let him know my concerns too and if anything was mentioned and he said no. I really hope nothing is wrong with my axles. Honda let me drive off the lot.</review>

<review>Staff was busy but still friendly.  I went in for 2 recalls on my 2001 civic and tbh was hesitant for the fact that it's an older car and I felt a bit out of place but I was helped with urgency and thanks to manny and the friendly staff at honda I got over that feeling quickly ... one of the recalls is the takata air bags and my vehicle was in a accident before I bought it so they deployed already... that being said they didn't do anything to them which is great concern to me but I trust that they wouldn't jeopardize the safety concern and I will just consider there expertise in the situation.   Even thobi really wish they would have atleast taken out the bags and sealed the dash but other than that amazing</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Review>if you get some offer like 500$ off coupon, They will put add additional charge like 950$ Alarm fee, 350?$ protect film fee. I went there a month a go to get price Honda accord 18 LX. they offer to me kind of best price via Email. when i got there they said I should pay like Alarm activate fee, Protection Film Fee. I was so confusing. when i got back home I found what it is on website. afterward I get it that was kind of scam or nasty tactics. I guess they might think I don't know that ones cause I'm just new newcomer In U.S.  anyway It was bad experience. Be aware guys< /Review>< pictures>

Hello,

Out of nowhere I get a call to let me know there's a recall for the airbags on my vehicle which I found good as I feel my vehicle is old but made me feel that Honda cares for their vehicles and is responsible.
I scheduled an appointment for 7/6719, a Saturday morning at 7AM.
I received two calls for reminder of my appointment.
I'm thinking everything is being handled very professional, to a point that would make me feel my next new car should be a Honda as they do seem to care about safety, are professionals, and attentive.
I got there at 6:45AM only to find two vehicles blocking the Service entry, a White GMC and a Black Honda Accord.
My wife had to be at work at 8AM and as more cars were gathering around and behind me which I knew weren't going to respect the fact that I got there first and as soon as any of the two vehicles blocking the entrance were moved either of the vehicles around me were gonna go in before me and they DID, I automatically knew things were going South.
The Vehicles blocking the entrance were moved at 7:09 exactly, I called more than three times and the phone only rang with no answer as I waited there till they opened at 7:09AM.
1. My appointment at 7:00AM was not respected.
2. The oriental gentleman had excellent customer service but misspelled my first name, I crossed it out and corrected it in front of him.
3. The shuttle service starts at 8:00AM and I had to call and use Lyft for a ride home, I feel Shuttle service should begin once open, very inconvenient.
4. My wife was late to work for waiting on me, all to Service Department opening late and vehicles going in ahead of me because when vehicles at entrance were moved, it granted them access to go in first even though I got there first.
5.  I pick up my Car and again, the guy was great but when I look at the Invoice, my name was mispelled again even though he saw me crossing and correcting it the first time and even talked about how it's spelled differently.

Everything started good but I ended very disappointed.

It was just too good to be true.

Best regards,

Jhonattan Vazquez</Review>

Great service at El Monte Honda. I tried other Honda dealerships closer to me but didn’t like the service so I prefer to drive a little out of my way to get excellent service at El Monte Honda.</text>

I went there because my car was showing the check engine light and well i know it usually takes about 2 hours when i do an oil change so i was expecting around the same time. this time it took 3 hours and i did not mind waiting in tu waiting area that you guys have provided. i know that recently the place hasn’t been doing exterior car washing, and i was fine with that. when i got my invoice i noticed that it say ‘complimentary exterior car wash’ and i thought to myself, well that’s freaking awesome and what it was for my disappointment that my car was not washed from outside at all. i just simply ask that if they haven’t provided for something to not state it in the invoice, i got really excited for nothing , i every thought to myself ‘well for waiting THREE hours, the exterior car wash is a nice gesture’ but there was nothing. other than that, Ken was really helpful and really through with the information he gave me.<//Text>

First time there at the El Monte dealership for my HRV service. I normally go to Norm Reeves Honda in West Covina. However, I was very impressed with the service and professionalism the staff provided. I really liked the fact I was given an estimated time my vehicles service would be completed. My vehicle was ready15 minutes before the estimated time. I will definitely be returning, good bye Norm Reeves.</text>

I called El Monte Honda on July 4th to ask for a price quote on Honda Pilot LX and EX trims, and met with Sale Representative named James.  He refused to give me a quote and asked me to come down to meet with him at dealer to get the price. He treated me like a guy who would just call a dealer to bother them. I don't know how they train those sale representatives but I recommend to stay away from here and take your business else where. Go to Goudy Honda where you will get treated with respect. And yes, I got the price quotes from Goudy Honda FYI!<//text>

Roger was very attentive to my needs as well as his manager. The best part of my visit at Honda was they were honest with me and never pushy or hounding with me and that to me is excellent dealership.</review>

I’m a first time buyer and Luis Montoya & his superior were of great assistance I could have not asked for better help they made my experience very comfortable and amazing. I recommend everyone to go and ask for Luis. Thanks for an amazing experience!< /text>

< Review>
The experience I had at El Monte was great. I had some issues on my side that needed some attention but the associates at El Monte where patient and not haggling like other dealerships. They are very professional and after I got my 2018 Honda Clarity, Jose showed me the features and even added my iPhone to the Bluetooth settings. I also worked with Flavio the manager who is a veteran like myself and he was able to give me what i wanted for my trade. I can’t say enough about the team there at El Monte Honda, great culture, great attitude, great people.< /Review>

I want to thank El Monte Honda & My sales man James Dean for my new Honda. I Love it. I walked in discouraged not thinking I was going to drive off with a car because of my driving record but James Dean made it happen he was so helpful polite and move things along so quickly I think I was there no more than 2 hours.< /Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Overall my experience at El Monte Honda was excellent! I was very nervous to go to the dealer because my first time buying a car was not a great experience. Alberto H. in sales changed my thought on dealerships and truly made the experience a pleasant and easy going one. He answered all of my questions, and made sure that I was comfortable every step of the way. Arturo was also awesome!!! He helped me out and even though I didn’t get the initial car I wanted, he talked to me in a non-judgemental way and explained to me the steps I needed to take for my particular situation. Great experience, I will definitley refer my friends and family or anyone I meet that needs a car, new or old. Thank you El Monte Honda!< /Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Driving a few extra miles to El Monte Honda is certainly worth it as Ken and the other staff members know how busy we are, and do their part to make the service stop as efficient and timely as possible. Thank you Ken and the other staff members for all you do.

Quick test, nice service, Ken explained what is going on with 2015 Honda Accord Sport. 3 battery in 3 year. 38k miles. Very disappointed. Looks like Honda couldn’t handle electrical problems that every Honda owner are complaining of. No more Honda, get Toyota Camry.< /text>

Read carelly before you sign!!!...they sell me a car and promise me is $25000 including everything(tax and other fees) when we sign the contract I did ask is total $25000? They said yes and show me the price#, me and my family not really read english so we saw the # we signed. After we received bill is $28000+, the extra is tax...we go to there ask them ,a guy try to yell to me and my father, said already signed and the bill shows that the true amount you need to pay!!! I told my friend about it and when she see the contract she find out same problem as me before she sign, that shows they always do this...<//text>

<Text>Great customer interaction, everyone was very polite and friendly.Went in for my first free oil change.  When I got my car I realized that it wasn’t washed, the meters that track the oil life weren’t reset and the tires were not rotated. so It made me doubt that the service on my car was completed. I did not have time to get anyone’s attention about these details because I was already on a constraint but I did leave disappointed because not all the services that were detailed were performed.<//Text>< userid>

Rigo is an experienced and knowledgeable salesperson.  He can tell what we want during our conversations and help us to find the right suv we want with a great price.  Excellent experience shopping in El Monte Honda.</text>

If both can be done at the same time then I doubt they are worth 2 hours of labor. Especially at a rate of $130 an hour. Friendly staff but pricing isn’t reasonable.<//text>< pictures>

<review>Andika Citra gave me the best customer service. He is very patient and goes above and beyond. There were two occasion I had to take my Honda for service and he made it quick an easy. The recent time I there for a battery issue he noticed one of my front lights was out and had it replaced. I enjoy going to the El Monte location since its close to my house and I had great experiences there.

Sincerely,

Cora</review>< Pics>

<Text>I recently when to Nelson Honda to get my annual oil change and had a wonderful experience. I had called the day before and spoke with the operator who set up the appointment and was pleasantly surprised at how smooth the process was and at how caring she seemed over the phone. Then once I get there I was serviced by Andika Citra and he was awesome. He explained everything clearly to me and once noticed me brought me into his office right away. Once the car was complete he walked into the waiting room and spotted and brought me over to finalize some details. Very happy with his service and most definitely will come back. Customer service at its finest.< /Text>< pics>

The website had the touring, so i thought it was weird. He specifically told me that not a lot of people buy them, so they stopped making them. Now why would he tell me that hmm.... I didnt think much of it, how gullible i am.. i also didnt have a lot of time to wonder about it since i have a busy schedule and had to buy it that day. Feel like a fool now.. really hurts cuz i saved my money a long time for this, and didnt quite get the car i want all because one sales person decided to tell me lies</review><user_name>Wander Bear</user_name>< Time>

Went in to get a car. 3 weeks later they call me to tell me that I didn't qualify for the car and had to come in with a co signer  or return the car. I had to back and return the car. What a waste of my time and bad for my already good credit score. So unprofessional. Never going here again. 😡😡😡< /Text>

<review>One of the worst service providers from Honda.

Service speciality will try to lock you in Most expensive package and treat you as you don’t know anything.

And then even after getting service you will still have doubt on them that they have actually done their job?  That will be the question. Also in my case my car was needed tier change and they didn’t had a time for that so this serious issue even after telling them 10 times that please take care of that one tier. Also they won’t call you if tour car is ready or not. Lucky I reached there before closing so I was able to pick my car. Otherwise If I would waited for them to call then probably I wouldn’t able to pick my car for the same day and had to wait next day to get it. Bottom line they don’t care.< /review>< pictures>

Terrible experience. Went in with a my sister asked the "manager" to give her numbers vs wasting her time. Yet that's exactly what happened. I'm never the type to complain about speaking English but the salesman that was assisting her couldn't even finish a sentence without saying "I don't know" or "I don't speak much English".I asked him if they had people there that speak English fluently? His answer was once again "I don't know". We went to the cars in the lot and the salesman that doesn't speak English was tryna put her in a car that all together cost 26,000. Yet I witnessed the same car just newer for cheaper which was 20,000. As I was telling them there is a cheaper car the salesman tells me no this car isn't the same and it cost more than it says. After all of this they ran her credit and didn t even give her an offer for the vehicle. Then they kept her drivers license. Had to drive back to pick it up. All together a waste!!!!< /review>

< review>
times: 7-9 am
Appointmens: online and over the phone, very easy and they do the standard 24 hr pre appointment reminder
instruction: when u arrive get off ur car and go look for ur technician its a mad house when u get there, if u cant get off ur car roll ur window down and call for ur rep. they will walk fown the aisle of cars to check people in but im too impatient.

customer service: seen 3 different reps and they are consistent, good friendly service.
cost: use coupons from their site, i normally go for the standard oil tire rotation package.

waiting area: small but clean, not too many power outlets, and the wifi is free just look for their sign that has the password.

overall: its good for the size of their service department, im used to larger establishments with plenty of waiting room space and a sea of reps, but they still manage to give me the service i need at this honda. highly recommend.<//review>

<review>Poor Service

In early January 2019, I used the HondaLink App (for Andriod) made a service appointment for my 2018 Honda Odyssey, the appointment date is 01/14/19 at 7:00AM at EL MONTE HONDA (NELSON HONDA).  I was the first customer there and I was on time.  At the service department, there are three open lanes, and I followed the sign and drove along the right lane, and I was the first car on that line, and there were few vehicles behind me.  While I’m waiting for the service representative to approach me, all in a sudden, there’s one lady who drove a Honda Fit cut in front of me and occupied the first place.  It was raining, that’s why I didn’t get out of my car at that moment, and no one service representative care about it.

After waiting for 10 minutes, around 7:10AM, there’s still no service representative approached me.  All three lanes have more cars waiting for service now, and then I realized several service representatives start serving customers BEHIND me, they all arrived after me!   And I waited another 5 minutes, there’s one service representative approached me and asked me about the detail of my appointment.  I told him that My appointment is 7AM and I’m here for (i) the 2018-19 Odyssey Power Sliding Door Latches Safety Recall and (ii) the squeeky sound on the steering wheel, and then he told me that my assigned service representative would not come in UNTIL 10:30AM.  And then, that representative told me that he will find another guy to help me.  Wow, why would the online reservation system allow customer to make reservation slot which is out of their service representative’s work schedule????

I’ve been waiting for another 15 minutes, and every service representatives seems so busy serving other customers who arrived later than me, but no one really care to come and assist me.  Then, there’s a second service representative, his name is Christian, approached me and asked me all over again what I’m here for.  I repeated myself and told him that My appointment is 7AM and I’m here for (i) the 2018-19 Odyssey Power Sliding Door Latches Safety Recall and (ii) the squeeky sound on the steering wheel, and then he informed me that my service representative would not come in until 10:30AM.  Christian wrote down my service request on his paper, and then he told me that the part for fixing the recall is not available, he said he would need to order the part first and then call me when the part is available.  But the ridicules thing is that he didn’t even ask me for my phone number in order to contact me.  And then I asked him:  Do you need my phone number in order to contact me when the part is available?  Then he wrote down my phone number.  In regards the squeeky sound on the steering wheel, Christian gave me his professional advice: “take it easy” on the steering wheel, they cannot take my car for service today.  At that point, I have no expectation for this service location, and honestly I don’t want my car be fixed by them.  After waiting 40 minutes of my time, I left.  By the way, it is still raining when I left, I wonder who’s liability if something wrong with the steering wheel.  “take it easy” is not enough.

As of today, 2/4/19, 22 days from my original appointment, AS MY EXPECTED, I did not receive any phone call from Nelson Honda to follow up with the status of the part availability.  I’m sure I wouldn’t go to EL MONTE HONDA (Nelson Honda) again. Their customer service is a joke. This is my first (and last) Honda vehicle.  I’m so regret that I didn’t read all the negative reviews from many google users and yelp users.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><userid>106264276767527987546< /userid>< rating>

Juan Montes was wonderful. If I only rated him and his friendly manner I would have rated my whole experience with five stars. However, I'm not sure the service department over charged me for the service and parts. I will definitely go back. THANK YOU JUAN MONTES !<//review>

Took my Honda for airbag recall last week. Andika citra was the service advisor who took good care of me. He's one of the patience human being and also really knowledgeable. The whole experience has been amazing working with him. Definitely will be back to see him when I need service< /Review>

I always have a positive experience at this dealership. Even though it is not the closest to me, it is the one I go to for everything. The staff is always friendly and willing to help in any way that they can. They are always true to their word and get the job done as quickly as possible. This last time I had my oil changed,  Andika Citra assisted me and he couldn't have been more polite. I will continue being loyal to Nelson Honda because of their exceptional staff.<//Review>

***VERY MISLEADING DEALER STAY AWAY***, I specifically sent the dealer a quote and ask if they can match it or if not I just walk away and not waste anyone’s time. After a few hours she stated a senior manager approved the quote and if I can make in today! It wasn’t a problem, went in later on that day. Apparently the Client Care Manager Kendra Chavez and Giselle Alvarez had left home for the day. I was greeted by an associate Adrian who showed me the car and later stated hey “by the way did they mentioned we have have all these extras installed on all the cars” in which I stated no they didn’t. He then replied “they always do that”. Aftermarket alarm $1,500 ?? 😬 No thanks, door guards $85, and mud guards $unknown! They install them on all cars it’s a non negotiable. He then suggested to ask his “Manager” we both agreed. Before I walked in the door a “Manager” 🤡 came out and went on to tell me hey all dealers are like this, you should just go where you received the quote. (They don’t have the color I want). He then told me the internet or care manager just make money off appointments. So they will say and do anything to just get you in here. I couldn’t believe what this individual was saying. I wasted my day with these people. Don’t trust anything they say and make sure you get a price breakdown for anything in this place! Unprofessional, Unethical and careless for their reputation and customers! Drive a little further out people and avoid this place if you can! For those brave enough good luck! 🙏< /Text>

I recently when to Nelson Honda to get my annual oil change and had a wonderful experience. I had called the day before and spoke with the operator who set up the appointment and was pleasantly surprised at how smooth the process was and at how caring she seemed over the phone. Then once I get there I was serviced by Andika Citra and he was awesome. He explained everything clearly to me and once noticed me brought me into his office right away. Once the car was complete he walked into the waiting room and spotted and brought me over to finalize some details. Very happy with his service and most definitely will come back. Customer service at its finest.< /Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Pics>None<//Pics><Time>1494528606950< /Time><review>I just wanted to recommend my salesperson Gabriela Gamez. I knew what I wanted and did my research so I spoke with Gabby a few times on the phone  and we worked out a price. I didn't want to go into the dealer for hours working on a deal . We agreed on a price and she set it up where i could come in and take care of everything quickly. We came in and looked over the paperwork and she  gave me the exact deal that we agreed upon. I have  purchased a lot of cars and the salesperson always try to pressure you and up sell you. Gaby was a honest and didn't pressure us at all.  So if you are in the market for a Honda I would recommend that you speak with Gaby and I am sure that she'd take care of you. Also, no offense to all the salespeople out front waiting on the next car to pull up,  avoid them and ask for Gaby you'll be happy you did.</review><UserId.>113423450394262592497< /UserId.>< username>

This the worst customer service ever the guy was rude and very unprofessional
I asked for and extra service on my car and he said you need to do another appointment or go somewhere else 🤷🏻‍♂️
What’s it’s that the car it’s a ready here.
Than he tell me call u and about 2 hrs the guy never call me
6 hrs pass I went back to the dealership
The service adviser it’s gone and no body knows about my car 👎👎👎👎
I not recommend this place 😖<//review>

Except for a few minutes of waiting while Andika attended to a customer ahead of me and a suggested wheel alignment other than a change oil I originally came for, everything went smoothly and I got my car back in due time. Great job, Andika!<//review>

<Text>I has brought 6-7 honda in the pass 15 year from this dealership, referring multiple friends and family. The dealership change their name 3 time...it is now El monte Honda.  Now they have the worst customer service, shoppers be ware.  Their price is 10% at minimum higher than everyone else.  Their financial paperwork was full of mistakes when the last time I bought a crv from them 2 year ago.... Today I did not expected them to treat me as a return customer this bad, telling me that they are losing money sell me the car... even when I provided proofs that alhambra Honda is 10% cheaper them what they can offer.  I would just be happy if these well dress salesman just tell me no that they can not match the price of the car I want to buy at this time.  NO MORE BUSINESS FOR EL MONTE HONDA FROM ME or from any of my family or friends.  I highly recommend do not shop for your next new and absolutely not used Honda at El monte Honda.  There many other honda dealership are nice, friendly and professional.... and will give you a good prices.....no one need take a risk to shop here at El monte Honda.<//Text>< gmap_id>

This dealership is the worst ever! I made an appointment at 9:00am for a routine oil change and here we are 2:30pm in the afternoon and I still haven't gotten my car returned. What is the point of making an appointment. Also, they DO NOT honor coupons. They have the worst customer service ever. Will definitely not be coming back. I rather take a further drive out to   West Covina Honda dealership where they truly take care of their customers!< /Review>

After a few hours she stated a senior manager approved the quote and if I can make in today! It wasn’t a problem, went in later on that day. Apparently the Client Care Manager Kendra Chavez and Giselle Alvarez had left home for the day. I was greeted by an associate Adrian who showed me the car and later stated hey “by the way did they mentioned we have have all these extras installed on all the cars” in which I stated no they didn’t. He then replied “they always do that”. Aftermarket alarm $1,500 ?? 😬 No thanks, door guards $85, and mud guards $unknown! They install them on all cars it’s a non negotiable. He then suggested to ask his “Manager” we both agreed. Before I walked in the door a “Manager” 🤡 came out and went on to tell me hey all dealers are like this, you should just go where you received the quote. (They don’t have the color I want). He then told me the internet or care manager just make money off appointments. So they will say and do anything to just get you in here. I couldn’t believe what this individual was saying. I wasted my day with these people. Don’t trust anything they say and make sure you get a price breakdown for anything in this place! Unprofessional, Unethical and careless for their reputation and customers! Drive a little further out people and avoid this place if you can! For those brave enough good luck! 🙏< /Review></record>

I love their service department but my experience with their sales/finance team was frustrating to say the least which is why the 2 stars. I was ready to buy, knew exactly what I wanted, got a very reasonable quote for a trade in value for my beautiful  2012 CRV-EX for a 2018 CRV. Then when I was ready to buy,  I was switched representatives to a man named Miguel from their finance department. He refused to honor the previously promised quote and new car price, he did this all in the most rude manner. It was insulting the way he treated my husband and me. We ran out of there after that. I will never buy a car from them because of that experience.</text>

<Review>This is my 2nd car from el monte Honda and couldn't be more satisfied by the service provided by my salesman Rigo O. He has been working there for years and definitely knows how to treat a potential buyer. Very thorough and helpful. Went to checkout a jeep that they had but ended up getting a CRV thanks to him.</Review>< gmap_id>

<Text>The worst experience I’ve never had. I did my third time maintenance today. I show him twice time coupons which is on your website says $78.99 something, but the representative told me that I don’t need that coz it’s just basic and he give me are higher, but after I paid $230 and got the recepit. I compared with the coupons. The coupons shows the ditails even more than the “higher” one. But I paid $230! And also I know is logical to pay the labor fees, but the representative never told me about that. The the labor fees are $117! Then I ask him wash my car simply, after one second he back and told me the washing tools is broken. What a funny thing. I just do a A12 maintenance. It take me 4 hours and when I’m waiting at the waiting area. I saw though another door that some stuffs are washing the new cars. But that’s fine coz it’s not in the service. when I’m leaving and found something on the receipt made me misunderstand. I called your dealership again and want to give a explain but the guy who answering my phone told me I need to talk with the one who help me or the manager. And then he told me manager’s name but told me she is not here today. I called the third time with a different number which I found it on google, I just said I want told to the supervisor of the service department. And then what happens. The phone is transferred to the manager which the prior’s guy told me she is not here. I’m not sure what I write here is make sense coz my poor English and I asl don’t know it’s useful or not. Anyway, I’ll never back to El Monte Honda. It’s full of lies.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Gmap_id>

Nick was ok I guess , I heard him complain a few times about how busy it was and who schedules all these appointments, than when I first show up some guy with glasses and a beard with tattoos laughs at me because I said I have a appointment with nick , really bad first impression, over all took about 2 hours for my car to get a oil change , can’t say I had a good experience but my car is fine no damages and oil change was done properly thanks< /Review>

I’ve been a customer with this Honda for 2 years now and they’ve always been so great with me! I went to trade in my HR-V for my CR-V and Cesar and jeff helped me get a great deal with comfortable payments and they showed me every detail with the car. I’m so happy with my new car and with the great expierence I had here.

Thank you to the sales manager Jesus and to Jeff and Cesar as well!

I recommend this Honda 100% espically if you’re a first time buyer and you’re a little nervous. They will help you out.<//Text>

If there is a negative star then I would give this place. They charged $260 for undefined service/diagnostic/inspection/labor rate, and so it's $130 for an hour of "procedure diagnostic." said the El Monte Honda service manager Tim Smith.

I was trying to calm myself down, and slowly with my low voice explaining my situation very nicely to him. However, he looks way more angry than myself that is kind of strange. He treats me, a customer like no body, with barely minimum professional manner. I wish, I could give him some Amlodipine Besylate 10 mg daily dose to calm him down. I so worried about his health.

I know I had to sign the contract in order to get my vehicle "serviced". The so called "service advisor name: Andika Citra. He was confusing, to the point that I never knew that was him or someone that I had been working with for over a week. He called me and said: "Great news, Kevin!, your vehicle is all serviced, and ready to come home. We only charged you $260 for 2 hours of diagnostics services, your car's fuses were burned out and now they are replaced"...

Back to Mr. service manager Tim Smith said: "it's reasonable to charge $130" and for who knows how many hours that they kept my Van in their "working area" then discovered that a couple of fuses in the fuses box got burned off or failed off because of the after market dash-cam installed 2 years ago when we first bought the Van. While I got the manufacture defect of rotor-motor for the back seat area of the Odyssey fixed just a week ago right there at their place. I thought the problem came from that causing my door not shutting right. I also thought Dealership are charging way more expensive for everything. He said: "it's your opinion or whatever you think, it doesn't matter."

He said I am NOT a technician so don't know about their "procedure" and how long it took. He was correct. No I am not. I am a Doctor of Pharmacy candidate, and I received no respect from a so called Honda service manager in his office, whom I don't know about the education level.

$130 is not a lot of money, but I am a Pharmacy student with 3 kids. I am poor. I hope one day when I am established, he could come to the pharmacy where I work and so I could consult him in a professional manner, and I could also show him how to solve problem where he had more anger in his eyes than I had. I could provide him more medications for free for the cost of the brand name(Norvasc) instead of generic medications(Amlodipine) and no prescriptions needed. It will be all on me, and you don't have to pay any share of cost.

Regardless, I wish both of them well for this holiday season, and if you want to spend your money for services there, it's up to your opinion.< /Text>

Renji Piao was on top of his work and was really friendly in assisting me when i came there with the mindset to buy a new car. El Monte Honda has some great workmanship and hiring people like Ren only makes the experience worthwhile to be apart of. Thanks guys!</review>

<text>Recently took my vehicle in for maintenance and was assigned to horrible service specialist by the name of Ming Peng (aka Gabriel). He not only lied to me about their shuttle service by denying me a pick up but overcharged me on my vehicle service and referred to my husband as   my "boss". Very disrespectful. This employee needs to be provided with training on how to treat customers and provide proper customer satisfaction.  I was shocked to find out that people like Ming Peng get away with this behavior, as I was told I was not the first customer to be denied/lied to about services available for customers. If you decide to visit this Honda service dept. make sure you dont let them assign you service specialist  Ming Peng (aka Gabriel).</text><time>1534480874553<//time><Gmap_id>0x80c2d0b1f0f5b3d3:0x82f32f5eabc29a09< /Gmap_id><pics>None<//pics><UserId.>115400461568992577331</UserId.><username>Maribell Moran<//username><rating>1<//rating><response>None< /response></record>

I was looking for a '13 Honda Fit. My first choice was to buy from a private party, but El Monte Honda advertised a car that was what I was looking for, so I did my research beforehand (luckily) and went there. El Monte Honda lived down to (almost) every expectation I had of a dealership.

I called ahead of time to make sure that the car would be available for a test drive. The sales person on the phone said that the car had Bluetooth and a back-up camera. The ad did not say the car had those features (I didn't want those features), and when I saw the car, it did not have Bluetooth or a backup camera.

James showed me the car--it seemed to be just what I was looking for. We looked it over--the license plate was falling off, only held on by one sheet metal screw. James said he would get the service department to fix it, so my friend (a mechanic) said it should be fastened with bolts. The service department fixed it with two sheet metal screws, so the next day my friend retapped the upper holes (that had been damaged) and fastened the license plate with bolts (the way it should be). I'm wary to trust the service department to do any maintenance on my car, and it certainly makes me wonder if they really did the 182-point inspection they were supposed to do for a Certified Pre-Owned car.

James was enthusiastic, but didn't know the car very well. He couldn't figure out how to open the door to get to the gas cap. When my friend (a mechanic) commented that the engine had a timing chain, James said it actually had a 'wet belt' (there isn't such a thing!). He also said that there was a seven-year powertrain warranty that started when I bought the car (not true, it starts from the original in-service date). While I was standing beside the Fit, another sales person said that the car came with three months of free XM radio (not on a Fit). Another sales person said the seat adjusted up and down (not on a Fit). Do any sales people know about the cars they are selling?

The sticker price on the window was over $1000 more than their internet ad that I brought with me. When I showed them the ad, they honored the lower price without any problem. However, when they printed out the first invoice, they tried to add $995 for a security system (I read in previous reviews that this tactic was common). I said I didn't want the security system, so they redid the invoice without the added charge (that took some time). I said I was paying cash, but they said they still had to do a credit check because it was over $10,000. I had to wait for over an hour for them to get an okay. (I have good credit, but it shouldn't mattered anyway with cash.)

The finance guy, Sergio, seemed to know what he was doing, and the actual financial transaction went quickly. I didn't have exact change, and Sergio didn't have change, so he said that he would send me a refund check for the overpayment. After several weeks, I didn't receive a check, so I called him up and he said he would send it right out. I finally got the check a week later.

The car was supposed to come with a manual (according to Certified Pre-Owned specs), but the dealership didn't have one. James said he would try to find one to send to me. A few weeks later I called about it, and they said they had just received one, but I needed to come in to pick it up (the dealership is a long ways away). After being transferred to several people, I talked to the parts guy who said he would mail it to me. That saved me an extra trip.

In conclusion, if you are going to this dealership, know what you want and do your homework beforehand. Be prepared that everyone there will tell you what you want to hear whether or not it is true.</text>

Renjie honesty was the best salesman I've worked with ever. This was my Second lease and they made it super easy. I told them What I wanted and they did it. He took his time is the pouring rainv tomake sure everything was done and found what I wanted. Norm Reeves couldn't give me this price and their stock was very limited. Makes me rethink my original purchase at Norm Reeves. Family owned is always the way to go. I could honestly see Marco working hard for me and it made me feel good. Thanks..< /Review>

<Review>If there was an option for no stars, then that would be my rating for their service department.

I came here for their A1 Service and I also used the ad they had on June 30.

I had done all my research with surrounding Honda Dealership Services and decided to come here. I did not even go to the one where my car was purchased from because El Monte had a the best deal for the service.

I had made an appointment the day before with Kenneth O. I showed up and checked in with him and 2 hours later my car was ready.

I thought they did a great job...until my 2018 Civic Hatchback started to scrape. I was driving on the freeway on July 4th, and I pulled over and checked what was wrong. I looked around my car but nothing was wrong.
I looked underneath my car and the engine cover from underneath had been what was
scraping.

Why? Because the service tech, Bernardo Hernandez, did not put back or maybe lost the clips/screws that held that piece up.

I called on the 4th, 5th, and 6th and even left messages through service for Kenneth. I received no calls in return.
I just decided to take it in on the 6th because whoever answered the phone at the service desk that day  informed me that I could bring in my car anytime and they willl just take a look at it because it would be something quick.

I got there and spoke to Gabriel. He told me there was nothing he can do besides make me wait 45min to an 1hr just to have my car looked at since I did not have an appointment. I was on a time crunch and had previously asked if i needed an appointment, to which i was told no. Seeing no real.other option, i decided to schedule an appointment for another day. Gabriel did not even take my name down or tell me what appointments were available. He just said that it was fine and that he would see me at my next appointment. He also told me to come back and talk to Kenneth to make an appointment since I was obviously frustrated. Meanwhile, a car porter named Nick was outside shaking his head and making faces at me not thinking I was aware.

If Bernardo had done his job correctly and completely and if Kenneth would have at least reached out, then there would not have been any issues.

I thought service was a team effort, but here,  they just threw each other under the bus. Gabriel seemed like he didn't want to deal with Kenneth's clients or his own.

After leaving the service area dissatisfied, I decided to go inside and find out if I could speak with the manager, Tim, but he had already left. The front desk lady tried calling service and no one had answered until she found out that they weren't taking calls. She called over the sales manager, Flavio.

(Side note: There is no communication at all apparently from service. I suggest some team building to remedy this.)

[15 minutes had already passed as I waited for a manager]

Flavio was informed and right away he walked out with me back to service. He listened to me intently even though it was not his area and he even got onto the geound in his dress clothes and checked underneath my car to see what was loose underneath. He went and talked to Gabriel and after no more than 15 minutes  my car was taken in and was back out almost instantly.

I know I will never have my car serviced here ever again due to their lack of work and communication.

I will come back if Flavio is still there only to purchase my next car from him. I would rate him and the lady at the service desk with 10 stars because they went out of their way to help me.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I went to 4 Hinda dealers to shop for Clarity.
On the 11th of October, I finally end up bringing the car home from El Monte Honda.
The Salesmen, were very supportive, helpful. They make transaction very simple, that make me very good from their service. Five Star on this one.

Sammy introduce me to the sales manager after explaining that what I want. It took him less than 15 minutes to make the decision. Everything were simple compare to other dealers.
Every one from sales to finance manager are very friendly and supered. Most important it make me feel I m being welcome.

I did not even realize how simple and fast they helped me to complete the transaction.
Yes, I m recomanding 2 more customers to the ElMonte Honda.

*Constructive: I went back on the 10/16/2018 after work late 6:30 pm, following up with my lease status. One of the finance manager was in charged.
He told me that I had to wait and they will call me and tried to walk away. I insisted to him to check the lease approval status on my transaction.
Then he took me to his office and told me to follow up with his Manager.
I got impression not being treated not as friendly and well come as my first time on the 10/11/2018 when I purchased the car. May be I m not his customer.

So being professional, the staffs should take care all customers with the curtetsey of their need.

The management should screen out the flaws and hidden weakness on the over all operation in order to be more competative.
Hope this comment could be in the constructive environment.
I will keep follow up the future comment to help the management to iron out the wrinklenesses on the operation. Feel free to contact me at any time, Thanks.<//text>

Brought my car Honda Civic for a major service to El Monte Jonda.  As always, Andy Vuong was very helpful and accommodating.  He made sure the technician looks into any problem I encountered regardless of small or big and  fix them if there are  issues.  I commute far to work so I trust Andy Vuong to make sure that my car is in top condition.  He was my go to person when I had an Acura.  I’m so happy that he is again my go to person for my Honda!</Text>

<Review>Updated review on 05/29/18.

TL;DR:
Get profiled, then get told you won't get help unless you commit to buying.

The long version:
I decided to rewrite this review for clarity (ha! pun intended - it'll make sense later). On Sunday 05/27/18 I was looking into possibly buying a new car and my wife and I chose El Monte Honda due to the 490+ reviews on Google with an average rating of 4.5 over Downey Honda which at the time of writing had 350+ reviews with an average rating of 4.0. Both dealerships with around the same distance from where I live so we went to the one with the higher rating.

Strike one.

We arrived at the lot and after parking were greeted by James - who was pleasant and asked the reason for our visit today. I let him know that we were interested in either the Clarity PHEV (see, the pun above makes sense now) or the Accord and he let me know that although he works with used vehicles - he would find another associate to assist me. We lingered around the lobby for a few minutes and we were next approached by an Asian female associate who asked us directly in Mandarin what were wanted to do today. I was taken aback initially that 1) I never spoke in Mandarin to James and 2) why the associate and/or the dealership management assumed I would speak Mandarin. In that brief moment of shock I did respond to her in Mandarin (because yes, I do speak it) and repeated what I stated earlier to James. She told me to hold on and she will find someone to help me and as I turned around she repeated what I just said in Mandarin to the tall African American gentleman to her side who I'm assuming is her sales manager.

Strike two.

We linger around again for just a brief moment when an older Mandarin- speaking associate named Jeff approached and introduced himself to us. I responded to him in English as that's my preferred language of communication and asked if we could proceed with our interaction in English. Jeff let me know it was no problem and asked what we were interested in today. Once again I repeated what I told James and the Asian female associate. Upon hearing me say that I was unsure if I was ready to buy today - Jeff (albeit politely and in somewhat of an apologetic tone) stated that due to the fact that it's Memorial Day weekend and they are really busy, he'd be happy to quickly show me some cars but it would not be possible for me to test drive any cars since he wants to make sure that he is able to properly assist customers who have committed to buying.

Strike three.

He proceeded to walk us outside and pointed at the three Accords immediately outside the showroom door and said he didn't know where the Clarity PHEV was (it was outside on the opposite side of the showroom - we walked past it on the way in). I once again wanted to clarify (ha! pun intended again) that I heard him correctly that he did say that since we were not committed to buying today that he was not going to allow us to test drive any cars. He confirmed and I thanked him for his time and my wife and I decided to leave.

Successful business is built through customer relationships and rapport, and in my brief 15 minutes at this dealership, I did not feel that this issue was of paramount importance to the staff and management who would rather prioritize the sale.

We went straight to Downey Honda where I eventually purchased the brand new 2018 Honda Clarity PHEV pictured with my review.

As with all internet reviews, my experience could have been unique, but your mileage may vary.<//Review>< Date>

I just brought my car for service and Manuel Montoya (Manny) was rude. First of all I call in twice and ask how much the transmission fluid was going to cost, rep said $140. Then when I brought it into manny, he said he charge all his customers $175. After I complain, he brought it down to $140. When I came to pick up my car, I needed to make sure the price was right, and then he said "what you don't trust me," I Said, "I have to check the price." Then he said, " do you have my business card?" "Yes." "Go ahead Throw it away." This is the attitude I get for bringing in my car for service??? So rude.<//text>

Sorry El Monte Honda I was very disappointed with the service provided. After, I pop a tired and had to get it replace not only did they changed the priced I was quoted but they didn't even checked that the alignment was necessary.  I had to take it the next day to Goudy Honda they checked everything not just what I told them.  Your service needs a lot of improvement.. Might want to check how Goudy operates.< /text>

< Review>
(The two stars is for the salesmen that helped me out and for the most of the staff. The blank ones as well as only getting two stars is for the yo-yo financing, spot-delivery and the back and forth with the finance dept).

Came in after heading to three different dealers (Nissan, Toyota, Ford), hoping to get a car. Not the greatest credit in the world, but fair. They got me in a 2018 Honda Civic hatch. Awesome (spot-delivery). Then, we found out that I’m not approved (here is the back and forth with finance, no co-signer and etc...). Okay fine (three weeks of that). We unwind the car (here comes the yo-yo). Got a used 2015 Mitsubishi Outlander (nice car, starts up a little harsh but good, drives a little weird, but okay all good), Brent told me I had to (HAD TO) get a 2yr warranty or else they wouldn’t give me the car (because that’s how it’s structured in the lenders terms), asked why? Said the lender wants it that way (SantanderConsumer).Warranties are optional, but I guess it depends, but for the most part it’s almost always optional (dealer sells it to you). Verified with manager in the dealership it’s optional but depends on deal, but almost always optional. I also got stuck with one of the worst lenders you could think of (Santander is notorious for extremely high APR%, read the reviews. Some people don’t get out of their deals easily, some get stuck with more payments, payments don’t go through and etc), and I get popped with a 22% interest rate (yo-yo financing=you get a spot delivery, you take the car, couple days later you get a call and dealer tells you you need more money down or a co-signer and etc, you agree to turn it in, but then you sign a contract that is in more of the dealers favor for another car, but this time you’re financing it and your interest rate is sky high and you they start loan packing and etc). Luis and Bryan (salesman did their jobs good, mike the manager as well, pretty all salesman are cool), Brent is the one that hit me with “HAVE TO” warranty, Mario (finance has attitude, but he’s alright), Tony (attitude but he’s okay), Albert (manager, helped out with cancelling the 2015 outlander.

With all this being said, I loved the Civic, but couldn’t keep it, the Mitsubishi (loved it more because of space, but mechanically questionable because of the sounds coming from the engine), but what really screwed everything up was the Mitsubishi deal, and the lack of communication on the first purchase (Civic, I expected calls, nothing, I called the dealer more than they called me for sure, I wanted to solidify that deal, so I was pissed half the time). What drove it home was the bad deal in the end.

(Returned the blue suv today, 06/11/2018).

I’d only recommend this place if you have your credit score on hand, know what you’re looking for, stick to it, walk away if you can’t get it. We all have to win, but when a dealer pressures you when you’re in need, you’re f——d. Best of luck. The house always wins. Unfortunately I wasted a lot of time, credit went down, no good deal, left empty handed.< /Review>

Overall great experience. I found a coupon online for a coolant flush and refill service that includes a leak test. My service consultant, Andika was very helpful. I explained to him that I was told from a different Honda dealership that my 2008 Civic Si had a leak in one of my coolant hoses but refused to tell me which one and recommended a complete rehose.. which has been a headache since I've babied this car. Andika stated that the leak could be seen while bleeding the coolant system. The service was estimated to be finished in about an hour or so. About 50 mins passed, Andika gave me a call to explain to me that the car is finishing up, and there are no visible leaks. He asked me to come to take a look at the car while it's still up. Upon arrival, he alongside the service mechanic Danny, used a flashlight to show me that there were no leaks. Then I was told that they'll finish up and will give me a call when it's fully done.

Once I received my car, I checked under the hood, and my coolant in the reservoir was lower than the minimum. I asked a worker there and they called the service mechanic Danny back. He explained that the coolant will come back once I started driving but if I felt more comfortable with it being topped off, he'll put some in. I then requested it to be topped off and he came back with coolant and put it in no problem.. after that he complimented my car and we were chatting about cars.. he gave me some advice on how to maintain my vehicle. He was probably the most informative service mechanic I have ever encountered at a Honda dealership.

I will definitely return to El Monte Honda for services. Very great experience on all parts of the service for a first time customer.< /Review>

If you're looking for a new or used vehicle this is the place to go!

Albert Vu and Ashlee Alderete are the ones you need to see!
They treat you like family and will give you the best customer service hands down!
This is the second vehicle that I have got from them, the first one was for my daughter, a 2016 Honda Civic and I went back to get my new 2017 Honda Accord Sport only because of the way I was treated!

I will refer new customers to them and continue to conduct all future business only thru them!

They are a great team and genuinely care about customers and will find you the perfect car and perfect deal!< /review></record></dataset><record>

We were able to work out a price that was agreeable. Edgar showed us how to work all the technology that is part of newer cars these days. We are still figuring out some of that as it was a lot to take in. Edgar set up both our phones for the Bluetooth which was helpful. Overall we were very pleased with the customer service and would recommend Edgar and the dealership.

Jeff Tinoco also helped me with my numbers was one of the best managers i ever dealt with i will def come back to this dealer to do business!! Will be bring one of my friends there next week and continue to do business with them because that is how the dealer should be making everyone feel ! Thank you very much jeff and mark!< /Text>

Poor customer service. 1. I pulled my car into driveway, no one helped me out until 5 minutes later. 2. I didn’ get notified when service is done 3. the last person who handled the key to me didn’t get the car in to driveway, I need to walk all the way to parking lot and look for my own cars.  Plus, he has no smiles at all.< /Text>

< Review>
This is my first time get my car service here due to a recall.  I usually go to Honda Norm Reeves for my car maintanence and service. But today I wanted to give El Monte Honda a try since they are close to where I live. Guess it’s my last time here. Appointment means nothing to them. My appointment was at 9:30 a.m. When I came, there was no one came to instruct me or greet me or even ask me what I am here for. I approached one gentleman and told him that I had appointment at 9:30 but he didn’t even look at me and said “just move your car forward madam.” I was pissed. Is this what you serve customer? Ask them to move their car instead of they moving car for us? I moved my car forward after the car in front of me left. Then I  just kept waiting and got so confused and had no idea what I was supposed to do.

No one came to ask or gave me a ticket number or something that would give me some clue. Until like 20 mins later a guy came and asked for my key. I told him about my experience and how late they got for my appointment. I don’t know his name but I wanted to say sorry to him since I was mad at him. It’s not his fault btw, it’s the comany management’s fault that they don’t know how to operate.

Totally bad experience here and I regret to come here instead of coming back to where I usually go to which is Honda Norms Reeves. They are way better than this dealer in terms of service and operation.</Review>

I’ve called 7 times and it’s so hard to get someone on the  phone to help you. Very bad service and the one time someone did answer they left me on hold for 30 minutes.< /Review>

<Text>this one has the worst service, when I asked to try my wanted model they told me to wait. I waited here for like half an hour without any sales’ any help. Worst service I’ve ever met.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< gmapID>

<text>I recently purchased my very first Honda:)
I must say I totally recommend Jesus "Chuy"  he helped us so much in choosing the right one for us 2016 Honda HRV EX 💙 I love this car so much his service was great he was always very honest helpful and non the less very patient"I went back 3times to make sure it was the one I really wanted" because I also traded in my jeep that I still owed, I got the best price for it they lowered the asking price in my HRV to try to balanced off the upside I had! He helped so much! Thank god we choose Nelson Honda! And thank you to Jesus for being such a great help!< /text>< pics>

<Review>I'd like to share my experience here. Gabriella Gamez was the most awesome saleswoman/salesperson! Great experience, no  pressure, no b.s., very knowledgeable. Bought 2 cars just she's so good. ;) Teamed up with Anthony Hollingsworth as our finance guy really took care of us! What a great team! Highly reccomended! Thanks again Anthony and Gabriella! It was a fun ride home in our new cars! Great deal!< /Review>< Pics>

I personally think Honda takes longer than other service places to do oil changes and I'm surprised they no longer wash customer's cars while small service providers do.<//Text>

Just got there yesterday for my maintenance. Change oil is included in the package but when I got home just found out that they did not change the sticker that indicate your next change oil sched so I was wondering if they really change my oil? Tire pressure was also checked and ajusted to 36 psi as shown on the paper work and when I woke up this morning, my tire is laying flat on the ground! I really hope that the nail in it was during when I headed back home.

Noticed that their service gone down. Before when you drive up to the service bay the service reps will come up and ask your needs or if you have been helped. Unfortunately the guys don’t see any customer coming in because they obviously they don’t want make eye contact with you. I have been going to this place since I bought the car in 2005 and I really hope they go back to review and improve their customer service.</Text>

<Text>Leased a Civic last year from el monte Honda the worst experience  ever most crooked sales and finance people I just went to have service done and was told I had to pay when I leased the vehicle I specifically asked to have the Honda care package added which covers all maintenance for 3 years they told me it would be included I called the service dept and was told it was not in the lease I got also the leased vehicle I turned in when I got this one was being used by dealer and received several parking tickets in the mail I called the dealer and they acted like it was my fault and said I should go to the  court and show the release of liability I will never do business here again and will report them to Honda finance office<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>I arrived at 1045am on a Saturday morning for an 11am appt. everything was disorganized and I wasn’t provided a shuttle home until 1130.

I was told my car would be ready by 3pm (4hrs) I didn’t receive my car until 430pm (5.5hrs) for a major service.

This is my second visit  and will be my last visit to this location.</review>< time>

They keep sending text messages to my phone for Natalie. I don’t know any Natalie and I’ve never been to El Monte Honda. I keep asking for them to stop, and they keep asking natalie for a review. But since Natalie isn’t getting her text massages, I’m writing the review for Natalie. One star.< /text>

<review>(Translated by Google) A very rubbish maintenance experience. The 5000-meter new car said there was a problem, and it would cost more than 400 to repair it. I said whether I want to do it or not. When I went there to pick up the car, I said that I had already driven twice. Wan Duo Mai, tell me the problem, and finally tell me that it was their mistake! So where did you tell me so many problems with my car before? Does such an unprofessional person think I am a novice and want to cheat money?

(Original)
非常垃圾的一次保养体验，5000迈的新车说存在问题，说要花费四百多进行维修，我说我想想要不要做，等我去那边提车的时候，说什么我已经开了两万多迈，告诉我存在的问题，最后告诉我，是他们的mistake！所以之前告诉我那么多我车存在的问题是哪里编造出来的？这么不专业的人员是觉得我很新手要骗钱吗！< /review>< pictures>

For me who doesn't know English, I am very happy to buy a car here because there is a wanting translation. Although she is part-time, her attitude is very serious. Hey, their service attitude is very, very good, especially thanks to Arturo Jimenez for giving me a very pleasant interest rate. He has very few words, but people are very good, very real, can help you solve practical problems, not like some The Chinese are very slippery and say a lot, that is, they will not solve the problem for you. If you want to buy a car, the Chinese can go to them.

我很幸运遇到了wanting 和她的经理Arturo Jimenez，对于不懂英文的我来说，在这里的这次买车很开心因为有wanting 的翻译，虽然她是兼职的但她的态度很认真热情❤️，他俩的服务态度非常非常好👍，特别感谢Arturo Jimenez给了我很惊喜的利率👍， 他话很少，但是人很好，很实在，能帮你解决实际问题，不会像有的中国人很滑，说的很多，就是不给你解决问题，如果想买车的中国人可以去找他俩哟。<//Text>< Pics>

<text>(Translated by Google) The 3-year contract is about to expire. After three years of experience, it is very unpleasant. Three years ago, I paid the top 3,000, with 275 per month, less than 286 in half a year, and then I have been paying 286. Their service is too It’s rotten, the two big brothers who speak Chinese. At that time, my car told me that it was only 175 a month ago. Later, I realized that my heart was stabbed with a knife. Until now, my heart is still bleeding, so the new immigrants in China Must see clearly

(Original)
3年合约快到期了，经过三年的的历经历，非常不愉快，三年前付了头款了3000，每月配275，半年不到涨到286，后来一直交286，他们的服务太烂了，会华语的两位大哥，当时这台车在三年前我朋友告诉才一个月配175，后来才知道，心里被剩刺了一刀，直到现在心还在流血，所以中国的新移民一定要看清楚<//text><Rating>1< /Rating>< user_name>

(Translated by Google) The Chinese salesman and manager checked my credit and the price they talked about was higher than other car dealers. I also recognized that the car I wanted did n’t have a white car in California. I recommend a blue one. I asked Is there a car? They said there were many, and then swiped the card and paid the first payment and let me sit and wait, but I didn't find the car until 9pm, I didn't wait for the car that night, called the first day and said that our credit was not approved, Try another bank again. Actually, I would like to ask, what does the credit do not pass my down payment? The day after tomorrow I bought the white I wanted at Goudy Honda, and it was cheaper! Never caring for your dishonest car again!

(Original)
华人的销售员和经理查完了我的信用后谈的价格虽然比其它车行价格高我也认了，说我要的车全加州都没有一辆白色的，推荐我要蓝色的，我问有车吗？他们说有很多，然后刷了卡交了头款让我坐着等，但等到晚上9点多也没有找到车，当晚没有等到车，第一天打电话问又说我们的信用在没有通过，又再试试其它银行，其实我想问，信用没有通过你刷我的头款做什么？后天我在Goudy Honda就买到了我想要的白色，而且价格更低！再也不会关照你们这家没诚信的车行！</text>

(Translated by Google) Buy a vehicle that in Puente Hills was $ 2000 cheaper, also the service is too expensive, they charged me for front brakes $ 350 while with a qualified mechanic it would have been $ 180 and lousy Costumer service they have you online for a long time to get you back to answer the same receptionist many times.
