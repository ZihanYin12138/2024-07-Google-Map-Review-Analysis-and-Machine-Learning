<text>We went yesterday to celebrate a friends birthday and I was a lil skeptical on the drive there. One because they were only doing wine by the bottle and no tastings were available,  two because they were fresh out of whites and three because we found out that the venue was at a house….. but after arriving we were greeted by the owners amazing daughter. Sorry I’m horrible with names, otherwise I’d give her a shout out. She served us the entire time we were there! She was very kind and welcoming and attentive. It was a lil warm and she brought out so much ice water to keep us cool the entire 4 hours we were there. We had 3 bottles while we were there and I liked all 3 but my favorite was the cab that I got to take home. It was a beautiful cozy adventure and I would definitely go back to try their whites!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80dbf1c1c02d122f:0x271f40ff8a16b1b8</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Most of the wine is not estate grown and personally that is something that interests me in local wine tasting . The one estate grown variety was our favorite on the tasting menu. Our server was very friendly and a breath of fresh air. The owner stopped by and visited our table, which was very nice. The tasting includes crackers and chocolate, however there was not a wine that really stood out to us. The tasting area was a bit 'busy' feeling even though we were one of the only ones there.< /review>

{'time': 1540141174521, 'text': 'Good Morning Ashley,\nThank you for your review.  We have 3600 vines that are planted on the Estate, Brunello Sangiovese being our primary grape of 2600 vines, 640 vines of Estate Barbera and Estate Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah.  We are a boutique winery producing only 1200 cases a year, our Estate wines are released to our club members first.  We sell out of very quickly We are happy that you enjoyed your visit and the atmosphere at the winery.\nOur goal is to provide and serve the very finest wine available.  Other than Peter and I we only have one full-time employee. You were quite right about the “busy feeling.”  Our tasting patios are amid our home.  8 weeks ago, was during harvest preparations, a situation we are just now starting to get beyond.  You deserve our apologies and hope you will try us again when we are less frantic.  Thank you for taking the trouble to share your observations.'}< /response>

Recently visited a lot of the local wineries in the Ramona area and we came across this one. One of the most accommodating wineries there is. Their tastings comes with a good amount of samples + complimentary chocolate and cracker! The owners are so nice and in terms of location/patio design. Altipiano has the best environment for lounging (specifically the patio overlooking the vineyard). Also they had probably the best tasting wine we tried that day. Highly recommend.< /Review>

We joined the wine club a couple of months ago and attended our first wine pick up party yesterday. What a spectacular event they put on to make you feel special to be part of the club. Great music, great food, and obviously great wine all wrapped together at their beautiful hilltop location east of Escondido.
We make new friends and had  epic afternoon enjoying our favorite beverage. I highly recommend the short drive to Altipiano!< /text>

<Review>UPDATED REVIEW: Denise contacted me by phone to discuss our experience at Altipiano in January mentioned below. She apologized for her employees behavior and assured me she would talk with her. Denise's heart for customer service and satisfaction shone through during our conversation. She worked immediately to correct the issue. Denise and her husband Peter provide a true family home environment - one of my favorite parts of Altipiano. I am happy to update my rating to 5 stars. I highly recommend visiting. Great wine, beautiful views and excellent customer service.  PREVIOUS REVIEW from January 2019: My husband and I have visited Altipiano Winery for the past four years, and it is one of our favorite wineries to visit in Ramona, due to the quality wines, the beautiful views and the excellent customer service. Today, we brought friends with us to enjoy this experience, and we were highly disappointed. Before could make it through the doorway of the tasting room, the woman working there loudly stated that she will need to check all IDs. She did not say hello, she did not say welcome to our winery, she simply saw us and stated she will need to see IDs (we are in our 40s-50s by the way). I do not mind showing an ID, but her attitude was unwelcoming and unkind - a completely different experience than what I am accustomed to at Altipiano. We showed our IDs and then found a table outside where we could sit. Thank God for Denise Clark today, or we would have walked out. Once we sat at our table, Denise (wine maker and co-owner) asked us how we were doing. Thank you Denise for asking. Your husband usually talks to us, pours our wine, tells jokes and makes us feel at home. Today we felt unwelcome, like strangers, until you visited our table. I hope you will have a talk with the woman working the tasting room, and help her understand how to treat ALL customers with kindness and respect. Please let us know when this has been done - I will begin referring people again once this has taken place. Thank you.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>
{'time': 1549303224879, 'text': "Dear Maia, Please PM me Denise@Altipianovineyard.com.  Let me start by saying I am very sorry, saddened and troubled that you and your friends did not feel welcome when you last visited us.  Peter and I go to great lengths to know that our customers are having the best experience we can offer and when we hear that you haven't, we take this very personally and will do everything to ensure this doesn't happen again.  I hope you will contact me on my private line.   If you could provide me the day that you visited so that I can ensure this doesn't happen again.  You may reach me at 760-839-7900. I want to thank you for bringing this to our attention and I hope you will come again as my guest.  All the best, Denise Clarke Co-Owner/Winemaker"}</response>

The wine is not only robust and flavorful but the atmosphere was delightful and the host/hostess were pleasant and I would highly recommend a conversation with them. Overall, the Altipiano vineyard is a great place to relax and enjoy some good company.< /text>

Fantastic wine and the most incredible view you could ever imagine.  We went to Paso Robles last year for our anniversary, but after visiting Altipiano I'm not sure why we left San Diego!  Altipiano's excellent wine, ambiance and the personal care of owners Peter and Denise, rate it well above others we visited in the north.  The cozy fire pit and table on the point are perfect for making new friends, too.  Just a terrific experience.<//Text>

For a relatively new winery these people rock with the sangiovese brunello for California. The winemaker,  Denise, knows what she likes and what my palate likes too. Kudos to Pete and Denise for their entrepreneurial spirit!< /review>

<text>Maria was very nice and accommodating.  They went beyond my expectation, free car rental, cost, service communication, just to name a few.  I was being charged $4K from another place while Nick, Maria and crew charged me way less.  Very happy with their service for a first time customer.

I have known this shop and owner since more than a decade
before this place I had same pain Like everyone go through same pain finding good and trustable mechanic who can diagnose the problem and get it done but since I find this guy refer by my uncle who was living canyon country before I moved out here,
Now I own car business and bring my mostly cars here I come here with worry face and leave with happily because they get the job done with very reasonable price
I'm very thankful to Mr. Nick and Maria who always on their toes back and fourth to get people car fixed they Hired very talented and genius mechanics who knows what they doing
Highly satisfied and recommend this place
Thank you</Review>

I Took my 2014 Jeep in to  Sierra auto care , due to some issues that was covered under my warranty. So they close the case with no phone call to say what they were fixed. It would off be nice to get a call to be told what then we’re going to fix. Before they close the case, but then didn’t get all what i Need done. but Two thing and then I had to take my vehicle back down there due to the transmission still being messed up they opened a new warranty. And finally push my transmission through now. I have to go back down. Because my mileage was flashing and I had seven trouble codes that was different  being from the new software update . Now I have codes due to the transmission that I cannot pass smog. (* Nike told me that sometimes you need to leave stuff alone.*) My vehicle is a 2014 Jeep Cherokee I should have no trouble codes after taking it to (a professional mechanic. ) I got screwed over pretty good I would’ve been better off not going down there. :(   Nike didn’t  charge me for anything but I believe that is due to the lack of communication at the first case when they closed it without contact.<//review>

Honest and efficient diagnostics with downright cheap services. The only local shop I would recommend. I waited around and chatted with the staff and customers for 3 1/2 hours while they did the work.1999 Ford F350 V10 with a monster camper on it. +THEY LOVE DOGS!</Review>

Hello. Brought my Ford Fusion in having issues with the dealership honoring my warranty, Nick and his team took care of everything and got my car back on the road.  Maria was especially helpful by going after the warranty people ensuring they honor their part. I appreciate their hospitality, taking the time to explain everything and patience, I will definitely recommend this shop. Thank you Nick, Maria and the Sierra Auto Care team!

PS- COVID-19 Did not stop them from getting essential workers back on the road!

<text>I use to come here a lot for all my automotive needs. Now never again. They have the worst communication with customers. Weeks come and go with not so much as a phone call. When I call they say they havnt looked at the car yet but will tomorrow. 3 days go by I call again still nothing. 50 not Five, 50 days go by when I finally give up and go pick up my car. They act like nothing. The keys are inside, no work done. To top it off they left the windows down so now my car is FILLED with dirty and ash from the fires. This is the most unprofessional thing I've ever seen in my life. Never again will I recommend this place to people in the area now I will do the opposite. STAY AWAY</text>< Pictures>

I took my 2001 Subaru Outback to Nick for a Alternator replacement. I had been recommended by a family member. He had my car in and out the same day, running like new and far less expensive than two other competitors. We have all heard horror stories of poor experiences from auto repair shops but you will not have that problem at Sierra Auto Care, my new go to auto shop. Thanks Nick, it was a pleasure meeting you.<//text>

Sierra Auto Care is my preferred mechanic in the Santa Clarita Valley. They have always treated me very well and have been honest, fair, and trustworthy. I've recommended everyone who needs car service to this place. The owner, Nick, and the receptionist, Maria, are very pleasant to work with.< /Text>

Wow! I can't believe my luck to have found this amazing shop. They're knowledgeable AND friendly AND fair.

I moved to Acton a few months ago and didn't know any mechanics in the area. (I had some interaction with one who's very close, geographic-wise, to this one. And the results between the two were like night and day.)

When I called about a 75,000 mile check up on my Audi, I knew it would be expensive. But THIS shop was so incredibly transparent and fair with their pricing, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. The prices were lower than anyone in their area or any area in the San Fernando Valley. (Plus Maria is incredibly friendly and I felt at ease right away on the phone.)

Their prices were a good $600-$1,600 below the quotes I got for the same service.

As if their prices weren't enough to go with them for, they were incredibly helpful - driving me all the way home to Acton when I was going to take the train. Wonderful find.< /Text>

<review>I will always be thankful for the tow truck driver who took me to Sierra 𝐀𝐮𝐭𝐨 Care. They serviced my car with major repairs and provided me very reasonable estimates. They are true to their customers.. no hidden costs.. always upfront.. to the point.. and we get back more than they give us.. true respect, courtesy, great business! Feels like family there!
Note: I had been to two other auto shops that same day and couldn’t service my car...But the third driver:  I can still here the AAA truck driver “I’m going to take you to a place that don’t rip off people. I‘m taking you to auto shop who care about their customers and do great work on cars.”< /review>< user_name>

Fantastic Service, communication and pricing! Will be using Sierra Auto Care for my future repairs. Maria was very helpful and Nick stayed in contact with me after the repairs were completed to make sure the car was doing well.

Called Sierra asking for a quote to replace some ignition coils. They quickly were able to give me a quote and they stuck to that quote after the repairs were completed. They stayed in communication with me notifying me that some additional parts need to be replaced( like gaskets etc) and gave me pricing.

They run a tidy shop. I was pretty impressed with how clean and neat the shop floor looked.

Thanks Sierra Auto Care<//review>

This place is awesome. Nick and Maria are really good at customer service. Nick and his repair staff are excellent at diagnosing problems and  fixing them.  Nick and Maria also work to find replacement parts within your budget either new or used. My wife and I have been taking our cars there for years and we are very happy with their honesty, friendliness and care they provide for our cars. I give them my highest recommendation.</Text>

Thanks Guys.. I was in there Wednesday, the 4th.. the guy with the Avalanche.. this shop is awesome. My Alternator went out on me on the 14, I managed to exit on Soledad, and finally came to a dead stop on Soledad and Sand Canyon. This was at 10am. Called and told them I didn't live in the area and needed to get my truck fixed asap, and they came through. For a very reasonable price. Another shop in the area wanted to charge me 3 times what they did. Maria, the front office clerk, is awesome. Kept seeing her on the phone, just calling people nonstop making sure parts were coming in. I was really impressed with them. They got me out the door in a few hours, due to my truck needing the 160 amp alternator. But they got the part in as soon as they could and got me back on the road. 10/10.< /text>

Hands down the best shop in Santa Clarita! Not only is the team here helpful and understanding, they do their best to provide an individualized experience for their customers. In the name Sierra Auto Care, the word care does not go to waste. They truly care about their customers and are willing to go the extra mile for satisfaction and to ensure they are taken care of.
It's a rare thing these days to say you trust your mechanic, but I would without a doubt say that about Sierra Auto Care.  Their honesty, integrity and hard work goes a long way. Seriously, if you're having car trouble, don't look any further, you've found your haven.< /Text>

This auto shop was great .I would recommend it to anyone that has had bad experience everywhere else , the gentleman by the name of Nick went above and beyond to educate me in things I didn't know about the problem with my son's car and was honest when it came to $ I won't hesitate to take my cars for service.< /review>

Nick was honest and explained everything they were going to do and why. I don't get that a lot from other repair shops. Fair priced and bonus... got to watch my favorite Marvel movies while waiting! Will continue to go to him, even if the drive is 30 mins away from home.< /text>

Nick is awesome.  Had a issue with new BMW I bought.  He went through it and diagnosed 4 major problems. Should get my baby back today. Great to know these guys can work on BMW's !! The dealer or "special" BMW shop would have charged twice the cost.<//Review>

Finding a good mechanic is like finding a good doctor.  Nick is the best "doctor" of fixing my ailing cars.  He did an amazing job, working with my Carmax warranty people.  So glad I found him.  Can't recommend him enough. Tom C.<//Text>

Impressed by the clarity and knowledge of Nick to explain what’s wrong, what’s imperative and what’s the expectation of repairs options for one of my daughter’s 2004 Volkswagen turbo charged car, with out pushing for the most costly alternative, refurbished, used or new parts were part of his presentation.....will be taking our cars there from now on< /Review>

<Review>Our experience with Canopy Energy has been great! They are very professional and explained the process clearly. Always there when needed, always attentive..
Elior took time to listen to our goals and proposed a system that met those goals. The crew showed up as scheduled at 10:00am on a Monday, and was done and gone at 4:30pm that Tuesday. They were consistently respectful of our space, and did a great job of keeping things clean.
We are the happy owners of a 29-panel, 8.99kW system and loving every sunshine minute.
Cannot say enough about these guys and highly recommend them.<//Review></record>

<Text>Outstanding company. Always above and beyond expectations. Contractors were professional, arriving on time, worked very efficiently and most impressive, they cleaned up behind themselves! A plus in my book. My system has been on line now for 5 months and everything is legit. Going Solar is the best move I had made for my home. Highly recommend if you’re looking to go Solar.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

< Review>
Canopy Energy delivered everything that was promised! On-time installation, professional service and support - including after sales follow up - and my system is producing the level of electricity I expected. Elior was understanding, courteous and professional along with all of his colleagues. They were very transparent about the numbers and warranty and quick to take action when problems surfaced (same day!). The system has performed very well thus far and am happy to report that I haven't had an electric bill in three months - that is awesome.<//Review>

Very nice service and the process was smooth. The final result is amazing, as our electricity bill has almost disappeared, apart from the months where we had little sun, but even then it's very low.<//text>

It was a pleasure to work with Canopy Energy. They answered all of my questions before I made my decision to purchase my system. They designed a system for my difficult roof orientation that delivers the energy they estimated. The system works great! I would certainly make the same decision to go with them.</Review>

My experience with Canopy Energy installing a solar system for my home has been extremely positive from first discussions of options through equipment selection, installation, startup and now routine operation. We could not be happier with the attention to detail and follow through from start to finish! I would absolutely recommend them if you are considering solar panels for your home! 😊<//review>

<review>Company took 3 months to get solar approved, at which time I had to pay for both Solar Loan and LADWP bill. I was told of a refund check for these months the solar was not being used.  It’s  been 3 months and I am still waiting for that check!! I had to chase LADWP for permits to get approval to turn on solar. Their customer Service is horrible, can’t get a hold of anyone.. I regret going with Canopy Energy!!!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< userid>

<Text>Compared multiple companies before choosing Canopy Energy, we are highly confident we made the best possible decision! communicated well throughout the process, kept all appointments & were timely with responses & needs.

I had been constantly getting telemarketer calls  From solar energy Company‘s.
All trying to convince me  to get Solar Energy.
I decided to get two or three estimates. After which time I would make a decision .

I received a presentation from a  representative of “Canopy Energy,”   named lLinda.

The presentation took about two hours of my time as I was trying to get ready to go to work.
I felt very much pressured by the sell person.

I told her that I would have to get two other estimates before making a decision about “Canopy Energy”.

I was visiting my sister in St. Louis. When I came back home,  They  had started putting  solar panels on my house.during my absence.

They never arrange a  schedule with me about installation, never told me the cost, I supposedly they had to do measurements to determine how many would be need and where.

I tried to talk to someone at the company, I got the runaround. The next thing I know a loan company called  “sunlight solar” , sent me a bill for $24,000.

Never discussed any long amounts, and the cost  was to be determined by the number of panels, measurements, and how many panels will be needed for my house, that never happened!

The monthly charges exceeds my electric bill, and subject to increase every year! In addition, I would have never agreed to their high interest rates.
I received two other estimates, one for 18k and smoother for 20k.

Canopy Energy installed solar panels on our home around two years ago. The converter stopped working about a six month in. I called Canopy Energy representative who had been handling my case since the beginning and he was able to sent someone out within several days to get it replaced. It’s worked flawlessly ever since. I was satisfied with their service since the beginning and now have a piece of mind that they are responsive when something’s wrong under warranty. If I had a second chance I’d probably go with them again.</Text>

<Text>Canopy Energy has been professional and prompt in answering all questions I had during the entire solar panel installation process. The sales rep Donna was extra helpful in responding to emails and getting me any info I needed. The panel installation were fast and professional,  all done within a month or so after contract signing. The panels they use are some of the better ones in the industry as well as the inverter. I recommend giving them a try if you're in the market for solar systems.<//Text></record>

Canopy Energy outperformed my expectations on this recent solar installation. They walked me through the process, helped me pick out the right solar system for my home, and gave me a sign on price that was lucrative and reasonable.

My main focus was doing something about my high energy bills! I felt like my hands were tied paying obscene amounts of money for my utility bill, so solar really was the best option. I’m in a much more comfortable position now than I was before. Thank you again!< /Review>

Found out that Canopy Energy is one of those annoying companies that call cell phones relentlessly.  Even though I have asked them to remove me from their calling list, they keep calling back over and over again.  Please do not support this company and their terrible business practices.<//Text>

<text>The team at Canopy Energy was fantastic!  They did a great job not only helping me with my solar installation, but also helped in other areas to improve my home including windows and new furnace.  They did a great job, and showed great passion and commitment to my project.  I recommend them for anyone seriously wanting to get the best job done for their solar or any home energy / efficiency project.  They are the best!!!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< username>

Every thing has been very good from the very start nd this has continued through the nearly 2 yeas since we have had the system.  Even when the converter developed a problem,, one call, withresponse the same day and in one day was replaced with a new one and the system up and running again.  It with no further problems. hs performed exactly what we were told it would do. Extremely qualified and helpful service people to help us along the way!! In our community many people have been taken in by so many solar companies, we were very lucky to have Canopy Solar put in our system. Would give them more than 5 stars if we could and would highly recommend them to anyone considering solar. Many thanks for what they have done !!!</review>

They worked quickly and efficiently in completing the project and the add ons of our contract. Followed my cues and suggestions with no problem.

Canopy Energy was a perfect solution for cutting PG&E costs. Using the 179 tax deduction I was able to buy the installation for my company and use it as a write off on top of the 30% tax credit.  Was a win win situation.  Canopy Energy went the extra mile on design, and construction, though it took a while to get installed partially due to winter storms, was conducted cleanly without issue.<//Review>

Had a great experience with canopy! From beginning to end everything ran pretty smoothly. It only took a couple of weeks after signing the contract for the job to be completed. I would highly recommend them if you are interested in solar.</Text>

<text>After many interviews and "solar parties", I was lucky enough to be referred by a friend to Canopy Energy.  Along with the Hero Program we will be able to finally move away from our utility company and be greener while saving money.  All the employees are incredibly professional, knowledgable and want to be sure that the solar installation exceeds the property owner's expectations.  They even clean up after themselves and leave the working areas spotless.  Thank you and job well done.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I ask them to have battery backup system they kept saying they take care of everything. Finds out after done they didn't put it in. And they told if PG&E goes out at least I have power during the day, but that was a lie, you don't. Then they it will cost me $4k to install a transfer switch in.

On 2/13/19, you received a call from Connie from Customer Care in regards to your NEM agreement and to let you know that PGE had approved your solar project for your solar connection. On 2/14/19 (Valentine's Day gift!), Brittany from Customer Care called you to schedule a service call with one of our technician to turn on your system on 2/18/19 between 9 AM and 11 AM. Yesterday, our technician Mr Gani arrived at your property (on time) and called you twice, knocked on your door for a while to meet with you but he didn't get any response from you. He still managed to access your solar system and turned it on, despite your dog outside barking at him (don't worry, we love dogs).  After he left your property, you called our technician back and told him that you were upset that he didn't knock harder for you to hear him. We are Canopy Energy coming with good news, not the Police, but still, please accept our apology! We also checked our records from Customer Care phone lines and didn't see any missed called from your phone number or messages from you. Brittany spoke to you again this morning and made sure you had the right numbers so if you need to reach out to us, please do not hesitate!

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>I purchased a 70,000.00 solar system Nov of 2017! September of 2018 the inverter went out! ( 1 inverter for the hole system?) It took 4 weeks to get new inverter installed! Many calls with little action! Forward to october 2018, this is my true up date with our power company! We owed the power company approx 800.00  According to their warranty they were to pay the difference! Well it's feb 2019 I can't even get a call back! Anybody who thinks there guarantee is good it is not! Think twice about using this company! They can't even afford an 800.00 refund!
Update 3/07/19! Irecieved the check in the full amount! It's to bad it took 4 months, but they lived up to there guarantee, so their word is now more credible! This should help with future contacts for service!<//review>< pics>

< review>
when canopy energy scheduler called and told me I could get solar power installed at   no out of-pocket expense to me I was skeptical. I almost didn't schedule but I'm really glad I did.  their sales rep Dawn explained  in a simple no pressure way how solar and the program that made me eligible for Solar (at no out of pocket expense) worked.  it was an offer I couldn't refuse so then Dawn guided me through the roller quick process of applying and getting approved for the program. at every turn every canopy representative that I came in contact with was courteous, professional, on time and delivered on every promise. now I am just waiting for my first non bill to see how much credit I will have for excess energy that my system produces and PG&E has to stockpile for me.</review>

From our first consultation, my husband and I were very impressed with level of service we received from everyone we worked with.  Our rep, Amada was amazing! She was personable, relatable, and very thorough in her presentation and answering all of our questions.  Her follow up and communication throughout the entire process was outstanding. I felt completely confident that the project was under control.  The staff at Canopy Energy, the installers, and the inspectors were all wonderful; very friendly, knowledgeable, and professional. We highly recommend their services and have been sharing our experience with all of neighbors.< /text>

<Text>Great job by all involved. Very knowledgeable and work was done in a professional manner.  They sold us what we needed and did not try and push us into anything we did not want. We thought we might need more solar panels and both salesmen said that would be over kill and not needed. Their representatives have called back and made sure all went well. They worked with our city (which isn't easy) and that went very smooth. We have nothing but great and wonderful things to say about the process and the time line to have everything finished. Well done!</Text>< date>

Very professional and answers all ones questions.  Work was fast and efficient.  Would highly recommend to anyone thinking about solar.  Big plus is that all panels are made in the USA.<//Text>

<review>My wife and I decided it was time to get into solar for our home!  We shopped around and found a salesperson that we could relate to and that we felt comfortable with.  Dawn was that person!  She told us what to expect and she took it from there.  The installers showed up and they were fantastic.  We have a flat tile roof and I was very concerned that they would leave the roof with cracked tiles.  They were very responsive to our needs and fixed the few tiles that were broken.  I would say this experience significantly exceeded our expectations.</review><user>114994657129068540317< /user></record>

Terrible company. They don't keep their promises and are always pushing to close the contract so they can get paid but they don't care about the quality of the workmanship. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. They hire different contractors to work on each project and sometimes they don't pay the unaffiliated contractors. I was harassed by one of their contractors told me that if canopy wouldn't pay them that they will put a lien on my property. Terrible company, stay away.<//Text>

Great experience. Our sales rep Dawn was fantastic. Answered all our questions at the home and helped direct our choices based on our specific situation. Also gave good recommendations on what to do (and not do).

The installation crew showed up on time and completed the work as promised. There were a few empty water bottles left behind, but after an 8 hour day in 90 degree weather, understandable. Easy oversight.

Derby Pineda, our online account rep has answered the phone immediately everytime I've called as well as prompt email follow ups.

In short, excellent experience from start to present day monitoring. I am a licensed general contractor. Quality company to work with. I will highly recommend Canopy Energy to all future clients and business I associate with.

My experience with Canopy Energy has been deplorable.
First the sales person Steve a nice guy, quoted me a cost of $64K to complete my re-roof and a 9KW grid tie system. I checked around and it was definitely too high.
In June Khaled Nouh; Sales Manager negotiated with me and reduced the price on the project down to $58K. It's a good size roof and system so I went ahead and authorized the work, financed by Renew Financial. The process for financing the project was pretty simple, but the rest of the project wasn't. There are some permit challenges in the HOA I live in; Canyon Lake, CA. and I assisted Canopy Energy through that process.  They started the job in early July, removed my entire roof and then it took over 1 1/2 months to partially complete the roof. They then completed my solar in another couple of weeks. At that point Khaled Nouh asked-begged me to sign off on the completed project so they could be paid be Renew Financial. With a project now over 2 months in process, I understand that some cash flow on the project was important to them. My back roof still wasn't complete so I asked Khaled Nouh to write me an e-mail stating that my back roof would be completed within a week. He wrote me the e-mail and I waited for his roofing crew to complete the work. Now it's been over a month since Canopy has been paid, my back roof is still incomplete and I'm getting calls from the roofing sub-contractor hired by Canopy Energy threatening to lien my home because they haven't been paid. I've sent 20+ e-mails and several calls to staff members at Canopy Energy all of them unresponsive.

I would rate them a -000 if your rating system allowed.

Recommendation: DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH  THIS COMPANY!!!

Sincerely, John Hodge, Homeowner..< /text>

Starting with my sales representative, Eric Amir, working with Canopy Energy was one of the smoothest transactions that I have made with numerous home improvement projects on my home.  The installation under the supervision of Adam Vanesyan was excellently done. Adam paid close attention to every detail.  And last but not least, the customer service efforts of Chigozie Omeaku were very much appreciated and reassuring about some of the paperwork that is pending completion. Overall, I am very satisfied with the work and customer service of Canopy Energy and very excited about referring my friends!</Text>

Terrible company!! in October 2017 I paid them over $11,000 as a deposit to start work.  nothing happened for four months....then they sent a subcontractor to do the roof work and he only flashed half the house before leaving for the weekend...it rained and water was pouring into half of my house.  I have suffered over $50,000 in property damage and they promised to fix everything....guess who is not returning my calls?!?! they are forcing me to sue....SO UNFORTUNATE.<//Review>

So disappointed.  They will not give you a quote of total cost until you apply for financial loan.  They spent nearly 3 hours going over how much I'll save in 5 years, 10 years, 20 years....but they won't tell me how much it will cost me until they run my credit score and I fill out a loan application.

Absolutely ridiculous!</review>

First of all, thank you for giving us the opportunity to meet with you and for your consideration. We provide free information on how to save money with no obligation to commit and I believe that is what we provided you with. Second, there is no "cost" to go solar. Solar is an investment (and an amazing one!), not an expense. Expenses cost money, investments make money (good ones at least). Solar saves and makes you money so if you go solar, the right question is not "How much it cost?" but "How much money can I save/make by switching?". Because there are so many programs and options available, we need to find out your credit profile if you plan on getting approved for $0 down financing for example. We care about giving you accurate, precise and personalize information and not ballpark figures like other companies. We would be glad to provide you with that information if you are still interested. If you already have switched to solar, then you have our most sinceres congratulations! As long as it wasn\'t for a lease... :) Have a shiny day! Canopy Energy'}< /resp>< gmap_id>

This company  they  came out do the installation, after they received the funds. They haven't finished  the service and my loan payment  start  the 12/15/17. And I am calling them a dozen time no one return  my call,  I am going to seek legal advice on what to do next, I am not going  pay for a job that is not completely finish.< /Text>

{'time': 1550618245147, 'text': 'Mrs Poyser, we would like to follow up on that review. Your review implied that your loan payment were starting before your solar system was completed and connected. Per Palmdale city records, your solar system was finaled by your city inspector on November 13th 2017. We were funded on November 16th after you released the funds. We submitted the connection documents that same day to SCE and you received your Permission to Operate on November 28th 2017. Your solar system was connected the next day (that fast) so you started saving before your first payment was due. And your system has been producing very well since! During the year 2018 for example, your solar system produced 1,125 kWh more than expected, mostly due to the exceptional products on your roof and the great design by our engineers! Only the best for our customers... Hopefully you have changed your mind about seeking legal advice and are willing to consider giving us 6 stars! Ok, just 5 stars would do... :) Have a shiny day! Canopy Energy'}< /resp>

So many things to love about this venue! I love how expansive the space is, so you don't feel claustrophobic if you have a large wedding guest list. There are multiple different options for where to hold the ceremony and reception, depending on the look and vibe you are going for. As a photographer, the light is so perfect at multiple parts of the day (which is rare!).<//Review>

<Review>Nice relaxing atmosphere to taste some wines. Junior took the time to explain each wine to us.  We were not rushed even though it was close to closing time. Our favorite was the zinfandel.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6bWy9elx2WS-AM3FMejYufDRjgCTHNdrGBgs2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvVtdLwoFCKONdXa_LYLF84vkEHzhHdPWmDwWU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWlTd19WWhagdMee5l3Dy_199z7dKUSPbHJgKO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

We love this winery. The employees are very courteous. We have been tasting at Trentadue for over a year now and never have experienced the pretentious vibe that we have felt at other wineries in the past. The prices are VERY reasonable and the quality is quite good. They have a very nice area for outdoors tastings making us very comfortable in spite of the pandemic.<//Text>

<text>One of my favorite wineries to visit! Excellent wines and very reasonable prices. Their ports are all very tasty, but my favorites are the petite, muscat, and Angelica. A somewhat hidden gem, this place is worth a stop if you're in the area.< /text>< Time>

The wine here is great—I especially liked the chardonnay. But this review is more for the other services. I went to a wedding here this weekend, and the staff were awesome: polite, friendly, very attentive, and went out of their way to get everyone what they needed. And the food was phenomenal. One of the best meals I've ever had at a wedding. I wish more of my friends would get married here!<//Review>

<Text>Excellent Prosecco and Port. Beautiful and relaxing grounds to chill and have a picnic. Customer service is not consistent...one day awesome...one day not so much...employees in tasting room need to be more passionate and friendly with their greeting of people and service...sucks to say that...but true...sometimes very disappointing as could be great every visit! Salute!</Text>< date>

< Review>
One of the Most beautiful winery's of all Sonoma County.  The most elegant Port I have ever tasted.  Chocolate Amore.  I have given this port to very very special people.  They are in awe when I give it to them and begin to tell them all about Trentadue.  Love there wines and the most beautiful place to have your wedding.  Enjoy!!!!!!</Review>

If you like port, this is the place to go in Sonoma County.  They even have a wine club just for port.< /Text>

<Text>Awful, winery absolutely never going there again. My friend (former tasting manager) highly recommended it so we went. Apparently this winery is hurting for money as their tasting room manager and staff keep track of every wine glass they give with each tasting and charge you it if it's not returned after you leave the winery. You get no warning nor does it say anywhere if you take the glass that they will charge you for it so you don't know they do it unless you check your transactions. A wedding party was having their rehearsal was finishing up while we were there and once they left one of the staff complained to the tasting manager that they took 6 glasses and his response was "don't worry we'll charge the bride for them." Mind you this couple is spending thousands of dollars at their winery and they're going to charge the bride unknownly for all those glasses. Not cool and distasteful on their part and wonder if that's even legal to charge you after you leave especially when they no longer have your credit card? The tasting manager (the only one pouring) also took a long phone call while we were there which was rude and he completely forgot about us once another couple came in that was a lot younger (there were only 4 customers total doing the tasting). My girlfriend felt bad and embarrassed for bringing me there as this was the worst experience we've ever had at a winery.< /Text><GmapID>0x80841019afbc2e6f:0xd8bacf73bd42d1ff< /GmapID><rating>1</rating>< resp>

<Pics>None</Pics><text>Ugh....They have sick employees coughing everywhere and I even saw one of the employees straching themselves with one of the nail files they use on the customer's!!! Ugh....The manager was very rude. She gave another woman service before me even tho I had been there an hour already before the other woman arrived. When I mentioned it to her she asked if I would wait until she was done with the customer even though I had already been waiting. I was so upset that I reported them for doing eyelashes while Corona virus is still running rampant. The worse thing a business can do is outright put themselves before the customer with no remorse. Smdh..... they don't even deserve one star in my opinion.</text><Response>None<//Response>< rate>

<Review>I would rate it a zero but it's impossible. Had the most horrifying experience ever. Walked in to get a fill on my nails and the lady grabs my hand reaches back into her hand and spit into it as if I didn't see it luckily I grabbed my hand away from her and walked out. I let the owner know but seems have done nothing but never ever will I go back to that place again unsanitary nasty high-priced and the reason why most people won't stop shop where they live. Why are we made to feel like animals just because we live in an area< /Review>< pics>

<review>Please dont ever go here for nails or eyelashes. Or at all! The acrylics lift nd just a gel manicure peeled off the next day. For my lash lift, my regular place i go to couldnt do them for the day nd since it was the only day i could get them lifted nd i live near by i took a chance nd she only lifted wat was already lifted living the rest lowered. Making my lashes look ridiculous. I couldn't wear mascara for a month since it was more noticeable. Nd my lashes hurt, so couldnt fix them after 2 weeks. She also fried one of my bottem lashes so i couldnt even wear mascara underneath! Also they are rude af nd over priced. Most ppl already think we are crazy to waist our money on our nails, lashes, etc. But they will only be right if u go here.</review><Response>None< /Response><Date>1565310487061< /Date>< pics>

A couple weeks ago I got acrylics and the acrylic powder had color I got them because previously i had gotten that and they were only $20 (year the same place) and they guy didn’t tell me the price and it ended up being $52 and an extra 10 for something that I didn’t ask for.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><user_id>110813696081599176140<//user_id><Date>1564121459491</Date><user_name>Martha Perez<//user_name>< gmap_id>

I asked for coffin and they look extremely squared. Once he was done I noticed my ring finger nail looked extremely thick and I asked for it to be fixed. I talked to the owner and she said no that it was fine and they’d fix it next time I go, I was very upset because they also had the audacity to charge me $35 for gel when I specifically asked for no gel. Finally after about 10 mins they fixed it and I left. Very bad service and the owner was rude.</Review>< Pics>

I don’t know the name of the guy who did my nails. I got there at 7:00pm and by the time it was my turn it was 7:30ish. The guy told me why i got here late i told him it was 7:00 when i got there. Anyway it seemed he didn’t want to do my nails but he did them anyway he did them so rushed the job was horrible my nails looked like cashews. He should of just told me no if he it was too late.
I asked for a Almond shape nails. Not cashews<//text>

I repeated a couple of times which to he would answer all with yes yes . I called the manager and told her how unsatisfied I was and she started talking to the rest of them in their language and started laughing.  So I walked away and told her I wasn't paying for that nasty job. It was awful and upsetting.<//text>< pics>

Dirty place. Worse painful pedicure spa ever! Massage chairs don't work all it does is vibrate, the chairs are cover in towels that smell humid and top it of a ball of mosquitos where flyin right in my face. The towel the lady used to dry my feet was so stiff it scratched my legs. Acrylic nails where okay but when i took 20 minutes to dry the nail polish a lady kept insisting it was dry and touched the polish ended up ruining the paint and didn't bother fixing it.<//text>

Rude guy on the overnight shift. Talked down to me when giving me advice that I didn't ask for. I can read tone and body language well and he acts superior.<//Text>

Its a small store with a basic selection of snacks and other goods. Drink and beer are in good supply and COLD! Reasonable prices on most things. Most of the employees are nice!<//text>

Store portion is ALWAYS closed during the hours of 2am-5am even though it’s supposed to be open. This morning “Alfurd” or something to that extent got nasty telling me he was on his 10 minute break when I tried to open the door. Went across the street, waited at 2 lights, got gas and snacks, and left to see “Alfurd” was still standing there across the street doing nothing. Oh and he refused to give me his managers name telling me to come back in tomorrow... It was around 3:45am. It IS tomorrow. He just ignored me and kept looking at his phone. Reported to corporate. This is the 5th time at least this has happened to me at this shell. Will never return.< /text>

They're always overpriced. There will be another gas station a mile or two down the road that will be 30¢ cheaper.<//Review>

Delicious Tandoori Chicken and the best Biryani!! The flavors were great and the food was fresh. I would return and suggest this place for Indian Food!! Portions were great and they give you the option of mild, medium or spicy biryani which is great.< /text>

PUTS DA BOMB IN BOMBAY!

Check out their Tandoori Tikka Pizza, it's pretty wild!

Samosa game is the tightest in the South Bay. The Tamarind sauce is so good I even put it on my pizza!<//text>

This place is AMAZING! The food was fresh & flavorful and the service 2nd to none! We actually ate it so fast we didn't take pictures. Thats our excuse for having it 2 nights in a row. The Saag Paneer was excellent and the Butter Chicken perfect, but it was the Chicken Tikka Pizza that stole the show! We only eat the crust when its worthy in this house and there wasn't a crumb left of this pie.

Besides the awesome food I have to applaud the service. The owner was friendly funny and warm. He even graciously accommodated the rush on our order without sacrificing an ounce of quality. WILL RETURN. Omw now actually.<//text>

This was my first time trying food at this restaurant and I ordered the Chana Masala, Somosas, Chicken Tikka, Garlic Naan and a side of rice. Everything was delicious and tasted fresh
It was honestly some of the best Indian food I have tried. Pret was friendly when taking my order and made the food fresh, so took about 30 minutes and was sincerely worth the wait! You can always order ahead and pick up when ready too! I will be coming back to try most dishes. Thank you!< /text>

Best Indian food I’ve ever had. Not to mention their pizza is insane. If you don’t know what to get, the Chicken Tikka Masala is amazing.

Also, the owner is very kind!<//text>

Long wait time. Pizza was good. Curry was underwhelming. Naan was thin and chewy.<//review>

<Review>Service was wonderful.

I ordered a vegetarian pizza and it came with a lot of veggies! This is rare when I have gone to other places they're skimpy with the toppings. Their saag paneer is also very delicious, would highly recommend it.<//Review>< gmapID>

Love coming to this place for their Copenhagen Gyro pizza, it's delicious! Their Tandoori pizza is really good too (kind of reminds me of bbq chicken pizza but way better). Samosas are also very good. Their chicken tikka masala sauce is mega delicious, but the chicken in it is a bit dry white meat. Just yesterday i called in to order food some they tend to take long i like to call about 25 minutes before I show up. They had made me the wrong pizza. I was very upset and the guy looked at me like oops what do you want me to do? After i told him to make me the right pizza and that ill wait he said he'd try to get it done in 10min and rushed to do it. Afterwards he apologized and told me to take both pizzas. All restaurants make mistakes but you can tell a lot by how they correct it and try to make it right with the customer. 👍<//Text>

The tandoori chicken pizza is one of the best pizza’s I’ve ever had ! I can’t believe I had never tried this place before. I highly recommend if you’re in the Torrance area. We loved all of our dishes. This place will be in our rotation.

It’s also worth mentioning that their customer service is excellent. They were extremely kind and I could tell they put a lot of care into their food.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I would definitely recommend Q nails. I got a full set with Larry and they came out perfect. He is awesome. The salon is really nice and clean. Great prices and excellent service.< /text>

<gmapID>0x80d760ad5d2ad051:0x30e4dc3870ffd60f</gmapID><text>Gel manicure came out bumpy, I didn’t have the time to stay and have them redo them. I was told I could return and get them redone at no cost. Upon my return 2 days later I was told I needed to pay full price because “my nails were bumpy, not the polish” I needed them done for an occasion and decided to give them the service anyways and use a different color since I know the problem was with the polish and not my nails. I sat down for my 9 o’clock appointment, the nail tech took off my gel then left me waiting for about 10-15 minutes while she took care of a wax without notifying me that she was stepping away to help another customer. I was cut on 3 different fingers. Needless to say I was correct, because my manicure came out better the 2nd time however, I will never return again.< /text><date>1618678571239</date>< user_name>

I was becoming a loyal customer until the day they gave me terrible service ! I went to get my gel color repair since the previous day I got my set done and my gel was bubbly and peeling off, so I went the next day after work, I waited 30 mts for the person who did them to fix them, ( since none of them fix others mistakes ) when she finally finished with her customer she was already helping me to fix my gel color half way removing the gel when the owner command her to stop with my service and to attend someone who just walk in ! The nail lady was Apologizing and asked me to wait 10 minutes because the owner told her to help the other person with a pedi!!! I just got up so furious and left extremely upset! They don't even deserve the one star!!!!!<//Review>

After seeing all the bad reviews Angie's nails got, and being a client for months, I decided to go by one recommendation made by someone about Qnails and I was not dissapointed. Everything looks perfectly clean and their customer service was great. I think maybe the lady that did my nails might've misunderstood on the color I wanted, but nevertheless, I liked how they provide a pamphlet with the different cuts with examples. I really recommend Qnails and will defenately be going back!<//text>

Amazing service was quicker than expected and my nails we're done by an expert. Tammy did my nails but I was unable to get the ladies name who did my pedicure. They both did a fantastic job and I completely satisfied with the outcome. They accommodated with what I wanted and achieved the expectations I had set for this company.. 1000% recommend this nail spot and I will be returning.< /text>

We got a pedicure done real fast and not the best, my mom got gel nail polish and she had it on her skin. They are rude, we were asking for the colors and we were ignored. Definitely not recommended, now I see why this place doesnt have demand as when they started.</Review>

I love how they do nails! Been going to them over a year. They don't make your nails big and bulky. Very nice<//Review>

Customer service is lacking as of recently.. they are in a hurry and not doing such a great job anymore, specifically on pedicures. Also, the appointments are out of control . You wait hours sometimes to only wait longer due to appointment arrivals ... 😒<//Review>

Used to love going here but after my last experience I doubt I will be going again. The guy that helped me kept giving me dirty looks while he was talking on his phone the whole time about getting his car serviced and to top it off my nails looked terrible. I just wanted a simple set.  🙄</Text>

<Text>The worst service I have ever had in my entire life. The man who worked on my nails was sooo rude to me all because I brought it to his attention that he glued on my acrylic tip very visibly crooked. He was so out of line and began to raise his voice saying I was crazy and must have forgotten my medication. After I spoke to the owner he apologized and said that this employee had acted this way to other clients as well! Obviously I will not be returning, I came to enjoy myself and left very upset!< /Text><user_name>Sally Elmore</user_name></record>

If there was such a thing as negative stars I would use them. This place should be shut down unless you like mediocre quality nails and service. The owner Helen does not know the meaning of good customer service and was completely rude when answering any questions I had. Her work was sloppy and she wanted to get me in and out as fast as possible. If I asked for poorly executed work to be redone she would roll her eyes and do it worse the 2nd time around. My nails were supposed to be square but were unproperly filed. So they were partially square on one side and partially coffin on the other. Almost all of my nails were at the brink of falling off after just 2 weeks. Oh & SHE DID HER TOE NAILS AT THE TABLE WHILE SHE WAS WORKING ON ME LIKE TF. If that isn't enough for you I don't know what is.</Text>

Great shop with a great atmosphere, facility is clean and I dig the rustic/industrial aesthetic to the place. In terms of customer service, expect nothing short of amazing. The barbers here are skilled and polite and won't scheme you for an extra dollar. Not to mention, there's free coffee!<//Review>

Veronica always has great customer service and always goes the extra mile to make sure my husband is satisfied with his hair cut. The shop is very tidy and clean, and our children enjoy the kids room while we wait for their father to get his haircut. This place is family friendly and everyone is very nice there, I strongly recommend it!</Text>< Pictures>

I've been here several times after my previous barber disappeared on me and I can officially say that I've found my new barber home. There's this thing I used to experience after every barber cut... Something like haircut regret...? It would look awesome until I get home and wash my hair, then I would see the cut from a different viewpoint and I don't seem to like it... oh well hair grows back right? But not this place. Veronica has done an outstanding job every time. I'm not exaggerating. Even strangers and family members would mention something about the haircut. Chris does an amazing job too. The thing with Chris though is that he has this massage machine which he uses on you after the haircut. Words cannot describe how soothing these massages are.

It's good to catch up with them, although it's every few months that I get my haircut. You won't be disappointed having these guys as your new barbers.

P.S. you can book your appts with them online or by phone.<//text>

I normally cut my own hair with hair clippers but, on this occasion my clippers quit working half way through my haircut. So I needed a barber. I looked all over town for a barber and they were all closed, with the exception of The Industry Barber Shop. I walked and was greeted immidiately. After a short wait I explained what happened and the lady barber fixed my hair right up. I was extremely satisfied and would recommend this barber shop to everyone and anyone.<//Text>

A female Barber walked in the front door and gave me better welcoming,notifying me if I was a walk in I had to sign in. I waited 20+ minutes and left. Had I had a proper welcoming, I would have waited longer but I felt out of place as a customer. Needless to say, schedule an appointment or you'll be waiting 40+ minutes to be seen.</Review>< Pictures>

I eat in this restaurant quite a bit! This is my favorite spot to have a bite.  I go to this spot at least once a month. The food is excellent, the staff is professional and the price is decent. I enjoy meeting in this spot for a good dinner.</text>

Such a great place. Try the Garlic chicken pizza with white sauce. If you love thin or thick crust they will make it for you. Fair price.<//Text>

Great calzones or try the Marina's special, extra cheese plus 8 toppings of your choice. I swear their medium is a large elsewhere.</Review>

The only great thing was the food. I guess it was "dads" turn to watch over his kids this weekend, that there are two gremlin kids that take over the parlor and are all over the place you can eat peacefully. watch over your kids "dad" they can cause an accident.<//text>

This place is awesome! They were flexible with my payment because I couldn't order online to ensure the pizza was delivered asap to an employee who was working on her birthday! Thanks for making it happen! Nilla helped me and her manager.</text>

<Text>I had 8-10 family member help me move and my wife suggested these guys. They have pizza that can feed 15-20. We got that pizza and it was more than enough and fresh. This place menu had it all but all I needed was the pizza. It was so big, they could make it 3 different types of pizza in one pie. I highly recommend it. The delivery time was alittle slow but it was also the basketball playoffs. So I expected that.</Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808f906ae0bfc689:0x4d7295feac60cc96< /gmapID></record>

<Text>Royce Hall is a beautiful Building inside and out. The university keeps it in wonderful condition. It's easy to hear who is on stage. I always choose to sit on the ground floor as close to the stage as possible. The seats are well cushioned and large enough to accommodate an average person.< /Text></record>

Beautiful architectural landmark which is synonymous with UCLA. Venue for lectures and events, both academic and otherwise. You've undoubtedly seen it appear in a Hollywood film as it is a popular location for movie ahoots, etc.</review>

<Text>Royce Hall is stunningly beautiful as is the library across the courtyard. The Acoustics were mind-bogglingly good. It has a wonderful feeling and environment once you step through the doors, and it is a place I feel tremendously comfortable and at home in. Besides that, the person that brought me deserves 6 Stars.<//Text>< Pics>

The only major ding... why sell alcohol but not tell us that we can’t bring alcohol into the theater!?! So it forces you to chug as soon as you buy the drinks. What a weird set up...< /text><time>1570981315400< /time>< Name>

Awesome Venue with family history. Saw a great jazz concert here. My partner is a alumni and hadn't been in the building since she was a freshman. We were staying in the area that night and she offered a tour of the campus and memory lane. We spent most of the next day on the campus.</Review>

I have been there many times for concerts, events ets.. the building is historic and beautiful (specially at night with a good moonlight). The only negative that comes to mind is the fact that it is not very accessible and distance between parking and building is considerable. The inside is pretty standard and nothing very stands out but I like its classic soul< /Text>

<review>Finally! I have my Sunday morning, football on the big screen, breakfast buffet, cheap mimosa sports bar and so close to my hood that I can ride my bike and take advantage of the great drink specials. In all honesty, I didn't try the breakfast but I know it was free. Kind of dark inside but there is a big open window that lets in a lot of light and has a counter for you to lean on in case there is anyone out there who still smokes. Can't wait 'til Sunday.<//review>< Pics>

It brings back memories and creates new ones. It reminds us of adversity and rekindles our quest for diversity. It is nostalgia and hope. It is UCLA.< /Review>

A justifiably famous venue. I was just back for the first time since high school and it still inspires that sense of history that 16 year old Misha was taken by. You know the names of the folks who have played here, and something about their essence still lingers. The upstairs poster room is dope too.<//review>

It's a very beautiful place that is almost relaxing. I loved walking by its large brick walls and realizing the meaning behind the building.</review>

Royce Hall is the landmark icon of UCLA and rightly so. It's beautiful and grand and is a symbol of academic achievement at one of the best institutions in the nation. Utilitarian wise, I have been to several Cultural nights in the historic auditorium and it is the perfect place to host those.</review>

Interesting architecture,  definitely feels old school.   Not particularly ornate as the Pantages  theatre in Hollywood,  still has an amazing feel of authenticity.

The Los Angeles Ballet performance of The Nutcracker in December was delightful.  From the balcony, we could see the entire stage come to life.  My kids enjoyed the ballet, especially my 10 year old daughter.

The audio was good, with ample sound for a classical performance. We will visit again for a concert.  Parking was about a mile walk, but we enjoyed walking through the historic UCLA campus.</Text>

<review>Two Bars which makes for getting your drink faster. They had a live cover band that played a wide range of music, all of which was conducive to singing and dancing. Overall a good casual place to go for drinks, not much seating available and the place was pretty packed by 11:30 on a Friday.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Saw John McLaughlin's last show here and it was absolutely epic. This venue is pretty incredible, the main theater area is majestic, and very aesthetically pleasing. Acoustics were great, we sat in the upper balcony area and had a superb view too. Definitely coming back to this venue for shows in the future.< /Review>

It is a big campus, take a while to find the building. Many parking structure on the campus.

Parking lot is close to the building, only a few minutes walk.

The building is well maintained. The theater is not too big. The ceiling is gorgeous!< /review>

I was very disappointed. I did not get to meet Mr. Or Mrs. Royce. I've heard many good things about them and their homemade chicken pot pies.  There were no mash potatoes served at the performance I attended.  Very upsetting. UCLA get it together.  We want chicken pot pies and mash potatoes!</review>

We had the cheap seats so they aren't going to be the best in the house but we were literally sitting sideways facing away from the stage with a railing blocking our view. The parking attendant told us that the garage was the only place to park and that it was cash only (why is it cash only? It's 2019, who carries cash? Also something that should be communicated before even purchasing tickets.) but when we went to get cash we found parking around the corner two blocks away. Even without those two extra blocks it was an extremely long walk with lots of hills for someone dressed up in high heels to go to the theater. The show was amazing and Batsheva dance company is the only reason this review gets as many stars as it did.</Text>

<Review>I went to see Tigran Hamasyan play here at Royce Hall and I must say that my experience was rather unfortunate.

I want to point out that while I had a great time at the concert, the staffers at Royce Hall did a relatively terrible job managing the show because while a show is going on, it seems that the ushers let people in as the concert in progress. I understand that this is to let people, who paid for their tickets, in but when it gets to the point that so many people are being let in at 20-30 minute intervals and to the point that the performer himself actually has to stop the concert just to let people take their seats, that just completely ruins the experience for everyone. I truly hope that the staff at Royce Hall is made aware of this because if this is a common practice at the performing center, they should know that letting huge groups of people in during the concert just spoils the performance. It is just rude and inconsiderate to the performer and the audience and it would perhaps be ideal to at least let the tardy people come in at the proper timing instead of during a song.</Review>< Time>

<text>I saw the Los Angeles ballet perform Swan Lake here. I've seen a lot of great performers at Royce Hall through the years but it didn't work for the ballet that night. The stage was too small and the ballerinas to crammed. Add to that the fact there was no Orchestra but only pre-recorded music and you really should spend a little bit more money to see a Russian ballet in a larger setting. I would have thought it to be okay and worth the money if they had a real Orchestra given they would still look cramped on stage. Unless your idea of a ballet takes place inside of bus bumping around with people the next time they tour like I said spend a little more money and go see the Bolshoi or Kirov.</text>< Pictures>

But this is not posted anywhere so you only realize it after you have parked and walked to kiosk. Also you can only pay cash, exact amount at the kiosk.

The exterior is gorgeous but the building is desperately in need of renovation or at least an update. The bathrooms are in the basement while the classrooms are on the first floor. When everyone is let out, the women's room is packed and lead to long lines. The exterior of the building is exquisite and the grounds are beautiful.< /review>

Along with Powell Library and Janss steps, Royce is one of the most iconic places on the campus, and has an absolutely stunning auditorium for events and the like. Royce also has some of the nicer lecture halls and classrooms on campus along with Haines and the rest of the humanities area.<//Text>

We say in the right corner of the balcony so couldn't see 20% of the stage. Otherwise, it was the right venue for the Nutcracker performed by the LA Ballet Company.<//Text>

I had recently found out Zakir Hussain was going to be performing since I live in Big Bear and the roads can be treacherous,  I decided to go I was there a little after 8:30 yes the performance had started but in no way was it sold out people were sitting in the box office with the curtain pulled and said that they couldn't help me get a ticket the people at the door didn't want to do anything, a lot of staff milling about not caring somebody spent two and a half hours to get there and they wouldn't take my money or let me in except the parking structure I paid $12 to park in I'm surprised that parking structure does not have a walkie-talkie with the box office so they could check to see if I could go in just kind of appalling behavior for a performance art place I guess why universities and colleges are getting bad names now this doesn't help</Text>

My family and I attended Brighter in the Dark performance 5/26/18 the show was amazing but the experience was horrible with alumni screaming at the top of their lungs "in support" of the performers. Though I understand, I was extremely disappointed that they were unable to control themselves. It's unfortunate that it ruined a great show. Perhaps you may consider a student/alumni section where they can scream into the ears of others.... While reserving a section for guests who are there to applaud in between acts when it is appropriate. Know, that I wilI caution others of the alumni behavior. I expected more from UCLA alumni.</Text>

< review>
We were there to celebrate 🎉 the independence day! The place is huge and the parking was miles away. The parking attendant told us to get the shuttle but we couldn't find the park so we walked. Ouch with my high heels 👠 lol The common restrooms were all locked and people were desperately looking for a restroom on two different floors. I was sad to see a person using a walking stick climbing stairs and find the restroom closed 😢 finally we snuck to the backstage and used one phew lol. After the show was over we had to walk back (I almost crawled lol) to the parking structure, thumbs down 😎<//review>
