<review>This was our first visit here. Mai the receptionist was exceptional. She was very welcoming and made everyone feel comfortable. My daughter's appointment went smoothly. I was so impressed that I set up an appointment for myself. Everybody there seemed to really enjoy their job and their clients were very important.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><rating>5<//rating><Response>None<//Response>< Name>

I HIGHLY recommend this place. I received the best service and feel like part of the family. Very professional, yet endearing. Mai at the desk is a sweet and funny woman. I love my new glasses and look forward to my check up(can't believe I can say that). Again...HIGHLY RECOMMEND!< /Review>

<date>1616618423588</date><rate>3<//rate><text>The staff was FANTASTIC! The doctor was wonderful. My appointment was fast and easy. However, I showed up and when I was DONE w the appointment, I was told that I could only get glasses. When I booked the appointment, this was NOT mentioned to me. They are only able to give prescriptions for glasses. Had the scheduler told me that, I would have just gone to Costco instead and paid for it. When the doctor told me and saw my reaction, she was VERY apologetic and just as frustrated. She stated that the schedulers keep scheduling people and not telling them that it is only for glasses. When I booked my appointment, I did tell them that I needed both contacts and glasses. Overall, if you just need glasses, they were fantastic. I loved the staff and experience. They apparently have a problem with the people doing the scheduling unfortunately :(</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<review>I buy my script glasses here because no matter what the lenses require and which frame you choose, the price out the door is ONLY $ 50.00 TOTAL, for MOST ALL SCRIPTS. However, for a pair of SCRIPT TRANSITIONAL GLASSES ( I'VE PAID YRS. AGO OVER $ 200.OO for one pair) Peachtree charges just $ 96.00! And they're approved for most Insurance programs.</review>< Response>

6 week wait?! Are you kidding me? Every time I call this place to check and see if the glasses I paid for have arrived they tell me the same thing. Still at the lab? Kidding me? If you need anything within 2 weeks do not bring your business here. What a joke.< /Review>

< Review>
This review is about my husband CALVIN who is the patient this issue happened to:  They charged over $100 for what is supposed to be prescription sunglasses then the patient finds out they didn't order the glasses as prescription but they charged him for prescription sunglasses and then the lady who orders the eyeglasses  lied and said the patient said he didn't want prescription even though he needs prescription eyeglasses. some one  who has to wear prescription glasses has to have prescription sunglasses. They lie and say you will get your eyeglasses in 3 weeks and 6 weeks go by and the eyeglasses still have NOT arrived. I DON'T recommend going here  Save your time and
the hassle and your money and go somewhere else.< /Review>

< review>
I thoroughly enjoyed my visits to Peach Tree Vision. It was my first time getting glasses, and at nearing thirty I was giddy like a child due to always having wanted glasses. They all genuinely enjoyed my excitement and I didn't feel judged or frowned upon in the slightest. They were very patient, helpful, informative, and made me feel welcome every time I was there. I plan on going back in soon to buy another pair or two as backups. I was also never pressured to buy glasses from them and was given an honest answer when I asked if I was able to take my prescription anywhere to buy glasses. Although I could have gone elsewhere with it, I chose to buy my glasses there in the end. They are very affordable. My insurance covered the exam, so I am not sure of the price range there, but as for the glasses themselves  I believe the each pair is $40 if I remember correctly. This was well over a year ago, so don't quote me due to my potential memory lapse or potential changes they may have made. I highly recommend this place! The glasses themselves have held up perfectly, as well.</review>

This was honestly the best dinner we’ve had in almost 2 years. I don’t think there was anything we didn’t like. The staff was super friendly and funny, and completely safe. From appetizers to dessert - incredible!</review>

<Text>Food was fantastic! Covid has hit all restaurants hard and La Stanza was new to Menlo Park opening in January 2020. The owner / chef has his Italian cuisine dialed. The cesar salad was dressed to perfection served on a chilled plate w/shavings of Parmigiano Reggiano.. Delish! My short rib ravioli special was exactly what I was hoping for. Hand made in house pasta baked to perfection. My wife had the sacchettto vegi pasta pocket stuffed w/vegis . The red sauce had tremendous flavor... and perfect to mop up with the bread. 🤪... This place is a must try!< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNX34ysygRAfUY4JdskEWJCljqoWTexl1t8tkCC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPutRTQYxVn5J4-D4QW22hv658j3fK54attApXm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVEfVCrD0FJGwzo7r-vslxybY-cYLenkxgwCuY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSHZMsiVXKVK7iI29_mnmgo5H8cROMKlF0eniD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPM_t4Qhv1TQF-zNVxWjMhmljBu5a9tnGosyWM1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJgSgAmm6Bt2IZ5XFlrDgcXMk705sQH5tyyDxl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4lao2_ScezAom5tEsaef_8MWghABWwLbUbML6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

Easily some of the best Italian I've had in the Bay Area. I would recommend anything on the menu (and I've tried most of it!) though the Gnocchi is particularly good. Such a gem!<//text>

Bravo!  Excellent authentic homemade Italian food!  I have ordered several times on DoorDash, and had the pleasure of picking up at the restaurant and meeting the owner, Angelo, from Sicily last week.  Their homemade pasta is delicious - as are  the salads - and the eggplant - and the squash/garbanzo soup.  We appreciate that they have kids entrees - my girls love the penne with a pink Rosa sauce.  They have a few tables outside but the pandemic must have been very difficult as they opened recently before it started I believe.  Oh, and if you order on Doordash, they include a complimentary Tiramisu.  Try out this neighborhood gem - or order from them online - you won't be disappointed.  Grazie!< /Text>

<Text>Pear + asiago fioccheti with tomato cream sauce was DELICIOUS. Also the tomato spread for the bread - so good. And tiramisu at the end, on the house! Tucked away and quiet, right off Santa Cruz Ave, with indoor and outdoor seating with plenty of social distancing. We had a great experience.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Vero italiano. Pleasently surprised with the quality of the food. Everything delicious, the dessert was unique (not the typical boring menu) Do yourself a favor and try the Fiochetti Aurora!

Outstanding attention as well, the Chef took time to meet us, later he sent a courtesy Tiramisu.

We will be back.</review>

New place just opened in January and it is amazing. Good is delicious and service is great. Small place so make sure to make reservations. So worth going here. The atmosphere is great not to dressy just a nice casual Italian restaurant.</text>

Creamy gnocchi, not too heavy and delicate flavor.
Delicious fioccheti (photo) with pear, great texture and character. Sauce goes well together.
Fried rice balls were crispy, not greasy, and not small as I thought it'd be.
Tiramisu is very soft and has strong coffee flavor.
Nothing's too salty & large portion. Also very kind service.</text>

Fantastic food at a reasonable price! From the soft bread to the fluffy tiramisu, all around great meal. First time customer but I will be back to try basically anything that comes in that creamy tomato sauce. Unfortunate that this restaurant opened just before covid lockdown, but with this high quality I have confidence they will be around for a long time.< /text>

Piccolo had been a fixture in downtown Menlo Park for years. My stepmom and I risked a visit, and were glad we did; the new incarnation is delicious and welcoming. We each had a salad and a pasta dish. Her mezzaluna ("half moon") ravioli were subtle and delicious, while my entree (I forget the pasta exactly) was tossed in a lovely tomato cream sauce. The prices are reasonable, the staff friendly, and the chef/owner visited our table personally to ensure our experience was good. It's a worthy successor. Visit without fear, it's great Italian in the heart of Menlo Park< /text>< Rating>

A must visit! The mezzaluna ravioli made of home made pasta AND sauce was full flavored and delicate. Chicken saporito was moist and balanced, gnocchi was light as a cloud, and they make their own Caesar dressing. Owners are gracious and accommodating.<//Review>

<UserId.>116020243099747248621< /UserId.><review>We chose this place over the many other Italian restaurants in the area because we saw they had homemade fresh pasta. La Stanza only opened last month and I was very impressed at what a well run, high quality restaurant it already is. Our experience was absolutely flawless from food to service to atmosphere. The hostess immediately greeted us at the door and took us to the nicest table in the restaurant, a booth right by the window. The space is so lovely, feels very cozy and European. Airy and open with fresh flowers, a wonderful place for a date! Our server was friendly and service was fast without feeling rushed. And don’t get me started on the food! Fresh bread and tomato olive tapenade to start, perfectly cooked calamari, and al dente fresh pasta. Their menu has something for everyone and I especially appreciate their daily specials menu. The owner even checked in with us at the end of our meal to make sure everything was up to par. This is definitely my new favorite “fancy” restaurant in town and I cannot wait to come back. Huge props to the whole team for the fantastic job they’re doing! Keep it up!< /review><name>Jessy Cherry<//name></record>

<text>Location/Atmosphere
Had a very romantic vibe! Perhaps a good place to have a date night with your spouse?
The table outside are nice but there really isn't much to long at aside from people walking by.

Food
Most of the food was fairly good, however, the desert portion was fairly disappointing.

Brushetta Di Pomodori---
Perhaps my favorite part of the entire meal? The Bruschetta disappeared from the table almost instantaneously. The kids kept asking for more....
Insalate Piccolo----
The salad was absolutely amazing! I loved the taste of the gorgonzola cheese and the salad had just the right chunks of avocado. My only suggestion is for the salad to be served with more pieces of dried cranberry. Other than that, I would definitely order this salad again! Oh, I do believe that it is filling enough to be ordered as a main entree.
Linguine Alle Vongole--
I love the spicy after taste of this pasta! It had just the right amount of garlic and clams. The pasta was simple but fulfilled it's purpose and was as described by the waiters.
--Desert--
Was rather disappointed in the deserts, we ordered the Tiramisu and plate of cannoli's.
Tiramisu--
Not going to lie, I was very disappointed with the Tiramisu. It tasted more like cake than actual Tiramisu. I've had better Tiramisu at Safeway.....
Cannoli Alla Ricotta--
The cheese and cream was okay, nothing special. The Cannoli's were hard and perhaps overcooked?

Prices
Definitely not cheap!

Service/Staff
The servers were very professional and attentive. However, the female server seemed to be in a rush whenever she was speaking or stopping by the table.

I may or may not be going back to this place. Perhaps for a date night but not with the kids. The place was expensive, more of a "once in a while treat". Definitely tasty though and worth the visit.....< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x808fa4af962d1ed7:0x5f6905656124d39a</GmapID></record>

I have taken my family to Piccolos several times and have always been delighted with their friendliness and great Italian food. We recently brought two guests who really enjoyed that small family restaurant touch and remarked about going back there with their friends.

It's not easy to find a restaurant that is so accommodating with their choices.  Almost anything can be cooked Gluten-Free we were told on our first visit and so that has covered our sensitivity requirement.

My favorite dish is their Melanzane alla Parmigiana.  I am craving it as I write this review.  See you there,<//review>

< Review>
We don't eat out a lot, but when we do we go to Piccolo. I like the seafood and pasta dish (which I always get with no sauce, to savor the pasta). Their pasta is excellent. We like the old-world authentic, small neighborhood feel of the restaurant. It's small and intimate, but not at all fussy. The staff is very professional and knows how to treat patrons. It's great to have a restaurant of this quality, to walk to if you live in Menlo Park.<//Review>

Wonderful restaurant a block off Santa Cruz Ave. Dropped in on a Saturday night, while busy, they were able to seat us right away. They don't have a children's menu, but were happy to make penne pasta with butter for our youngest. Staff was very personable and always accessible (it's a small dining room). Veal Marsala was perfect... tender Veal, fresh sliced mushrooms, with a light hint of Marsala. The Penne with the spicy marina had just the right amount of heat/spice. Hope to get here one more time before our trip is over.< /review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>Piccolo is a Pretty good Italian restaurant in Menlo Park, it's my family's go-to when we want Italian.  Appetizers are well proportioned for sharing. The burrata is excellent, bruschetta do pomodori is yummy, prosciutto e melone is great, and the piccolo salad was good too. I had the vongole as my main and it was good. The do have specials, so be sure to listen for those before deciding what you want. The menu is small, but everything on there is good.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmmv-EpUAX5z-y-g9YJperhIoG2GYVqzyWVoLo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<text>Waiter was shorthanded but not attentive. Pizza was soggy, salad had loads of bacon buried at the bottom I didn't find until the end, otherwise was tasteless. Altogether too much money for marginal food and slow service. Oh, and very noisy.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

The chicken was extremely tough, you could barely cut it with a knife. The lasagna was average. The bolognese was the best dish in our table but it was still not worth coming back.</review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Very nice dinner. We ordered burrata, which was delicious. The bread was quite toasted though and it tasted excellent on the house bread they brought to the table. We also ordered carpaccio, which was good, but had mustard smeared on it, which while a questionable choice, was okay. Definitely would have been better without the mustard. My friend got the rigatoni with rustic sauce including pork sausage, peas, and mushrooms. She enjoyed it a lot. I got the ribbon pasta with pear and ricotta in a gorgonzola sauce. This was amazing. Just a hint of pear and the flavors blended exquisitely. The oanna Cotta was very good and the cannollis we're also delicious. Good wine list. Cute little place, nice atmosphere. Our server was very lovely. Definitely give this place a try.< /Review>< pics>

<text>My boyfriend took me here for Valentine's Day. He made a reservation for 8pm and we arrived at 7:54pm. The tiny place was packed and there was no room for waiting customers. There were 3 other couples waiting and some of them had to wait outside in the cold because of the lack of space. When 8:05pm came, there were still no available tables and nobody communicated how much longer we had to wait, so everyone just stood there. A table opened up at 8:15ish and there was confusion as to who should be seated first since the other couples also had the same reservations.

When we got a table, they forgot to give us bread. I know they were extremely busy and understaffed, but that just made the experience worse. I ordered the homemade fettuccine with spicy tomato sauce and prawns. I didn't enjoy it, but my boyfriend liked his cheese and pear filled pasta. The dessert was the highlight for me. We had the tiramisu which wasn't too sweet nor overwhelming.

That first experience turned me off so I would suggest NOT going here during peak days like Valentine's.</text>< Pics>

<Text>Piccolo is probably my new favorite Italian Restaurant.  My boyfriend and I decided to try it one night after driving by it a few times and seeing it constantly packed with patrons.

Appetizer: Avocado Salad ($10)
We split an Avocado Salad. as our appetizer.  It was a pretty large portion and they served it to us in two plates without us asking which was very thoughtful! One salad was enough for two and we loved the honey mustard  dressing!

Main Dishes: Fiocchetti con Pere ($15) &  Fettuccine con gamberi ($17)
On the menu "Fiocchetti con Pere" is described as "homemade ribbons pasta filled with cheese, pear and gorgonzola sauce" and is apparently the restaurant's signature dish. We went with our server's recommendation and ordered this; however, she mentioned that it did not have pear in it. I'm not sure if they ran out of pear or changed the recipe but we were not given an explanation.  Hopefully they will have it with pear next time we visit.  Still, it was very delicious.  I am not a huge cheese person so my boyfriend finished the dish for me and I ate his Fettuccine con Gamberi which was also quite tasty.

Dessert: Panna Cotta (Passionfruit)
Even though we stuffed ourselves with the large portion sizes we still left room for dessert and shared the passionfruit Panna Cotta.

We will definitely be back for another visit and to try more items on the list.  It is a bit pricey but you definitely get the quality that you pay for.</Text><resp>None</resp></record>

<Text>I have made three different service visits, with 2 different cars at the Quick Lane. 11/12/18 Engine Coolant Flush / Wheel Alignment Check. 11/14/18 Wheel Alignment Check. 2/28/19 Computer Reprogramming.

All three times I received excellent customer service, and was not sold anything I didn't need. The guys in the shop are always hustling (@ssholes & elbows). The two Service Writers Brian, and Megan are just about the nicest service writers I have ever met. The Manager Dominic, even took 15 minutes out of his day to test drive my car with me in the back seat to confirm, and verify a concern I had with my brakes.

I've read the negative reviews some Yelpers have written about this business, and have found them unreasonable. Before you leave a negative review, you should contact the manager "Dominic" to at least give him a chance to make a fair resolution to your complaint.

I do recommend to make an appointment, even for a simple oil change, and that's because they're always busy. That should tell you something right there.

<review>This is a convenient place to have your car serviced, but I won't give it a 5th star because of their lack of attention when it comes to customer service. On multiple occasions, we have dropped a car off for service with the last thing told to us is that they "will call when the car is ready." We always call ahead for appointments when necessary and drop the car off early for routine maintenance. The last few times I have had to call at almost the end of the day to ask if the car is done yet. The person on the phone will ask who our service rep was and then they look up our vehicle info. Then they tell us, "It's all ready to go. Come down when you're ready." Well, I was ready when it was ready. Where was my call when it was done? Come on Quick Lane, don't forget the last step. You've got too much competition in the area to just mail it in.<//review><user_id>108797791817557142643<//user_id><gmap_id>0x80853d4a841dfa15:0xa5c65c27109e1df9< /gmap_id>< Time>

<review>Brought my F 250 for an oil change and they were perfect on that. But, a big but, I had an oil leak so they power washed the engine, told me the gaskets all had to be changed and the estimate was $8500. I am not kidding. So I took to Red Label across the street and they determined after an extensive look into that it wasn't what Quick Lane had said and fixed for a lot less. Feel like I walked into Quick Lane with the words "Sucker" on my forehead. So five stars for a standard oil change but a minus 3 stars for trying to pay their monthly lease payment off my bank account. Bottom line, DO NOT TAKE your truck here!!!</review>< pics>

They have not been able to make appointments online yet but when you call in they are quick tip accommodate you and get the appointment you need. I've always had my car returned in a decent time frame. One of the best waiting rooms I have been in with Wi-Fi access plugins and coffee outside of the pandemic situation. Easy location to walk to a nearby restaurant if you felt like it. They have lots to choose from on their maintenance menus and windows overlooking the mechanic bays are fun to watch with all the cars being worked on!</Text>

From their manager Chris Lewis through all the technicians and advisors, they were 100% awesome! Couldn't ask for a better spot to service a vehicle. Ford or non Ford vehicles,  they do a great job!< /Review>

Do NOT USE this business for anything more complicated than an oil change! You will be sorry because the workers are very young and they don't know very much.
I received VERY poor customer service from Quick Lane this week. I needed to replace my passenger side mirror so I entrusted the sales advisor, NIKKI RAU, to guide me with ordering the necessary parts, facilitating my maintenance work order,  and providing excellent customer service. When my part arrived, the "sales advisor" told me that my new part was a complete assembly and that I no longer needed the housing and the mirror that I handed to her for evaluation. I asked her what I should do with it, she shrugged her shoulders, and said that she would throw it away. After my part arrives and I bring my vehicle for service, I became dissatisfied with the lack of respect from the same "sales advisor" after she  hinted at me repeatedly that she did not want me waiting inside the business because my car would be worked on for a long time. I found this offensive because I am old enough to be this young woman's mother. Therefore, I took my car elsewhere; I went to MAACO. I was dismayed to find out that my new parts were NOT a complete assembly and that the Quick Lane "sales advisor"  threw away something necessary…the housing!  I had to buy a new one.  DO NOT COME HERE! YOU WILL BE VERY SORRY. I will not use Quick Lane, nor will I purchase another car from Ron Dupratt Ford. I'm so tired of the BS with Ford businesses.</review>

Had them replace my battery.  Was quoted $165 (horrible but it's a pain to get to in my 2013 Escape and they have to reset the charging system in diagnostics).  Messed up the bill, added core charge but said that was less than the labor they didn't charge would have been.  Even so, total was $179.  Not excited about returning.<//Text>

New team, Matt helped me out with my brakes and coolants and was able to get it done as time he quoted which i know sometimes that's ether going to happen or not and it;s a trickiy thing in the automotive industry but he got it done! Thank you so much and i know these guys have a lot to pick back up after Greg screwed everything up for these guys but im sure they will get it back off the ground again!<//Text>

Update to my last review as of 10/06/20: Matt set me up to come in for some warranty work and repairs unfortunately he wasn’t there to get me all squared away so I was bummed  to hear that so I let TJ check me in and when I asked for a quote he attempted to charge me 3x what Matt had quoted me and the shop across the street as well as Fairfield Ford. Well i guess that’s why this quick lane has such bad reputation oh well retardlane see you later

New advisors and service manager! love these guys as they went above and beyond on my ford warranty stuff! i even brought my toyota in for repairs and they took care of me excallent staff!</text>

Took vehicle in for "the works" had coupon for $44.95. Vehicle returned to me without tires being rotated, "due to wear and age". My tires have a legal amount of tread for safety. Went to quick lane mainly for the tire rotation. Spent $50for oil change , received no money back or credit for the tires not being rotated. Oil changes can be purchased elsewhere for considerably less money. I will never do business with quick lane again!< /review>

First time at this place they did the  front  and back breaks only the pad were replaced, within 1year the pads had some malfunction that damaged my 2 front and back rotors.  Note this car is  only used on the freeway ( 20miles per day)
Second time at this place to redo the breaks they replaced all 4 rotors , With in 2 week I  noticed noises from my back tires, got out of the car an found 2 bungee cord one in each side that they Left there used to hold the break to allowed them to change the rotors. Yes they are a clean place but need some checks in place, very por accountability.</text>

Worst waste of time ever. Quick Lane was a disaster. We show up there told that we can expect a 2 hour wait, maybe up to 3 hour wait, as a walk in. For an oil change. I don’t live in vacaville so did my best to walk around to fill the time. After hearing nothing for over 3 hours I came and they hadn’t even started. No apology. No providing for a realistic wait time. The oil change was finally done and took FIVE HOURS. Never again. - UPDATE (a few days later) - after the five hour wait, Quick Lane didn't even bother refilling the wiper fluids. Seriously - what a racket. There is a lot of competition in the auto maintenance category, I recommend a competitor over Quick Lane.</Text>

Obligatory break down on a road trip. These people went above and beyond to fix us up on the spot and get us back on the road as fast as they could. Frequent status updates to ease our minds, honest pricing. I'd make them my regular regular shop if I lived in that area.</Review>

<Name>Bonnie Atilano<//Name><review>Great customer service! They do not nickel & dime you to death. Use to doing my own air/cabin filter because most places charge so much to change them. But not at Quick Lane and the oil change included a tire rotation at no extra charge. Your wasting your money if you don’t get your oil changed here!!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< userid>

<Text>BEWARE OF QUICKLANE!

They did not tighten oil filter!
They changed my oil in Chevy Traverse. 2 days later spots of oil were on the ground. I looked under car and underside of motor was covered in oil. Checked oil filter and is was extremely loose. Took it back in for them to fix. Tech cleaned it off and said everything was tight. I then tightened oil filter another 1/2 turn!  Manager Tim said he believes tech and must have just been from filter change got a little oil on engine. Come back in if it still leaks.  No compensation for my time I wasted, and didn’t believe filter was loose. Also underside of car is still covered in oil from leak. They are not competent and don’t back work. BEWARE!</Text><GmapID>0x80853d4a841dfa15:0xa5c65c27109e1df9</GmapID><Rate>1</Rate>< name>

Authentic Brazilian Halal food with considerable amount of dish sizes and kind hosts. It's the first timer for us but the first bite tells how special the dishes are from those immutable Brazilian/Halal dishes we had in Portland, OR. Super duper!</text>

Awesome restaurant with very friendly service and delicious food. We went to the grand re-opening yesterday and they were very generous and full of energy! They gave us some free appetizers to try for free with some delicious dipping sauces. We had the turkey bacon wrapped chicken and the garlic shrimp. Both were very tasty and were served with a kale salad, white rice and fries. I also recommend their fried yuca! They also have a ton of fresh juices and açaí bowls. We tried their pineapple mint drink and it was really good but super minty if you stirred it up. They also gave us a free sample of the Brazilian soda they had. My only complaints are the flies in the restaurant and they didn’t seem to have a non-dairy salad dressing available.<//review>

<review>AMAZING!!! My husband is from Brazil and he said that this is authentic Brazilian food! I have been to Brazil once as well and it truly is! Honestly even better than I remember the food being in Brazil! Everything was DELICIOUS!! And everything is made from scratch and by hand by Daniel who is the owner and main chef! They have only been in business for four months and they have got it figured out! Everything is beautiful and brand new and the atmosphere is wonderful! If you know the Brazilian culture, then you know how warm and welcoming they are, and D Best Brazilian Food feels the same! I highly suggest everyone come here, I promise you will not be disappointed!!! The appetizers, entrees (we tried most of them), desserts (we tried one of everything), the natural juices (we ordered one of each) is ALL jaw dropping!!! We honestly have tried almost everything on the menu and it is wonderful. Thank you Daniel!!!!< /review>< pictures>

Spoke with the owner when I was there with the family and they're open consistently now along with an "OPEN" sign.  Excellent food, loved it and so did the wife.  Tried the Picana beef plate, didn't realize it was grass fed beef.  I say this as for those who have not tried grass fed beef it can be tough, but extremely flavorful and a bonus is that it is healthier, look it up.  When eating grass fed beef, cut into smaller bite size pieces and it will be fine. Definitely not tender like wagyu (Japanese beef) so don't expect it, just a different type of beef.
Wife had the chicken stroganoff, which was delicious, along with a side of beef pastel, yummy.  Pastel is a bit like Indian samosa except very light crust filled with meat and not spicy.
Owner gave us a free side of beans to try and it was delicious.  Staff is very accommodating and attentive.  We did have a side of fried bananas that we had forgotten about and was delivered late, was comped the plate without even asking.  Love this about small owner operated restaurants, typically much better service.
Will I be back again, of course and many times more.< /text>

It's Halal😍😍
The food is amazing and delicious.
Customer service is amazing

They make you feel very welcomed and you will not want to leave at all.

Gilbert and Felipe and other staff are amazing. I did forget one of the other guys name but thanks for letting me try the green mint chutney so delicious. Try all of their sauces it's very delicious and yummy.

If there were more stars I would have given more.

Try something new and give it a chance because I was not disappointed and neither will you depending on your taste buds.<//text>

<Text>Liked a lot. Coxinha was small but tasty and the portion was a good size. Price is reasonable comparing to the churrascaria near me. Passion fruit juice was a little too concentrated a little sour for me, suggestions would be to put it in a blender and make it less concentrated.  Loved the ambient with the pretty pictures on the wall. The servers very polite too.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Date>1581978457579< /Date><resp>None< /resp>< username>

<review>This appears to be a brand new restaurant that has yet to open (new sign outside and rolled up flooring inside), so it’s fascinating that there are 11 5 star reviews. We attempted to go there for a bite, but obviously that’s not possible when the business isn’t open for business. As such, do not believe any of these other reviews as they are lies. I’ll update when this business actually serves customers.</review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x809ad7b08ac4c3bf:0xa098c9357b1bcd06<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<name>Aida Orozco< /name><text>It's a new place, so their menu isn't very extensive and I've only been there once but I will definitely go back to try more of the food. The people there are super nice, the place is clean & pretty big inside. Every plate comes with rice,  fries and a salad. I tried the beans also. The fries and beans are well seasoned & yummy. The salad was good also with a tasty dressing. I put their chile on the white rice - hot!! lol luckily, I like my food spicy...The steak was sooo tender and well seasoned. Can't wait to try more.</text></record></dataset><record>

The food here is really good. They have only been here for a couple of months, but the guys are very friendly and the food is so good. My wife had the garlic shrimp...I would have been jealous, but my steak and onions was just as I like it. They are in an area that isn't the best, but they deserve a try. Great new restaurants  like this come and go all to often. I know we'll do what we can to help them survive by eating there. I don't think it will be to much of a sacrifice, except to my waist.<//Text>

At first your surprised by the shopping centers lack of appeal but honestly customer service was superb and it being my first time they gave me a free juice ( it was amazing by the way I would definitely get another one when I go back) I ordered the beef stroganoff and the flavor was pretty impressive nice cuts of meat and overall very clean. Will definitely be going back.

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>This place is a hidden gem. When have you ever heard of halal brazilian food? Especially in Sacramento!!?

D Best is located next to the Shan Market and is 100% halal. I believe they get their meat from next door. The location is not the nicest so just be aware at night.

In terms of food, everything we ordered was so tasty. We ordered the Turkey bacon wrapped chickens, Chicken Stroganoff, lots of juices and more. All dishes had a unique taste and it made me craving for more. I was a huge fan of the Chicken Stroganoff. The juices are also freshly made.

The service is A+. The waiters and staff took care of us, were very courteous and really cared about our experience. They also totally redesigned the interior of the restaurant and it's definitely been improved.

I hope they continue to grow and improve their efficiency because they can easily become a go to spot for halal-eaters.</Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Really authentic Brazilian food!
I was very impressed with the taste. Really like being in Brazil. They have the best appetizers you got to try all of them! My favorite dish will be the chicken or beef stroganoff and don't forget to try their traditional Brazilian beans(pinto).
I'm from Bolivia Sudamerica and this is the only place l was able to enjoy an exotic 💯 natural fresh guava, maracuya and acai juice! Amazing ❤️🇧🇷
I'll will highly recommended!</text>

As a visitor, I appreciate the canyons in SD and the trails within them. They can be a bit rough though. Its hard to tell what's a path and what's a creek bed, and the trails often just fade away to nothing.</text>

< Review>
So beautiful. I love places to hike in San Diego and I can say of all the spots I've visited so far, this part of Mission Trails is my favorite. So many trees, and a couple waterfalls complete with a gorgeous brook. Excellent spot to take pictures as well, if you're into that.</Review>

<Text>A good example of one of the things that make San Diego unique: canyons in the metro area. Lovingly maintained by Friends of the Canyons, the Sierra Club, the City and other locals, Juniper Canyon invites you to wander and explore the unique flora and fauna indigenous to SoCal. Please be kind by taking only pictures and leaving only footprints so others can enjoy the space.<//Text>< rate>

Beautiful, great walk, but I always take a trash bag, and it gets filled in less than ,5 miles.
Come on peeps!

Living in the Burlingame neighborhood, Juniper canyon is a piece of open space that figures heavily in my dog walking cycle.

As opposed to nearby Switzer Canyon which is a great spot for a picnic, or to read, meditate, think, imbibe, whatever, Juniper Canyon is a thin walking trail / wash. You're not going to find much area aside right off Juniper street where you can hang out for any extended period of time.

If you enter from the Juniper side, it's a slight uphill walk through a wash up to the exit past the signage on Nutmeg street. It is certainly a wash though, and any type of rain is going to produce a muddy running water mess. This has resulted in some pretty serious ruts and exposed river rock. Ankles beware. Especially if your dog is like mine and likes to pull.

There is an access road off of Maple street if you feel like climbing your way out of the canyon early, but that's up the side and is pretty steep.<//text>

I came here in Feb/march for highlights to be done by Sandee she did and amazing job my hair came out better than expected. She is so sweet nice and is a perfectionist. I brought my daughter her today her first time coloring her hair ever i had Sandee do her highlights and again she nailed it we showed her a pic of what my daughter wanted and it came out perfect my daughter is so happy with her hair and Sandee kept making sure that if she didn't like it or wanted it darker she will do it don't be afraid to speak up and Sandee was letting her know how to take care of it and what products to use. Sandee thank you so much your truly AMAZING. the 1st pic is my daughter's the 2nd is mine<//text>

< Review>
Sandee does mine and my moms hair and she did a great job! I recently started seeing her and my mom has been seeing her for the last year I believe. I love the cut she gave me, it wasn’t too drastic and it’s perfect to give it structure for easy styling. My mom always looks fabulous with the colors Sandee does for her, I would definitely recommend her to my friends and family ❤️</Review>

Sarah the owner of the salon is truly wonderful, I love the decor which is just beautiful. I have been seeing my stylist Sandy.
She does a fabulous job with my hair and manages to always make me look 10yrs younger. Sandy is not just an artist when it comes to hair but is genuinely a wonderful person. I look forward to hair appointments each time. All my family and most of my friends see Sandy as well. I wholeheartedly recommend Vintage styles.<//review><Rating>5< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

This salon is everything. The decor, the stylists, the products, the time and care you receive and the beautiful results when you leave. I love my Stylist, Sandee.
She knows me and what I like. I drive 2 hours to see her. 5 STAR SERVICE!< /Text>

<Text>I was new to Fremont and needed a salon near me. Needless to say, got tired of constantly going to another city to get my haircut. Vintage Styles was recommended to me so I went to give them a try.

First, I was really impressed with how friendly the entire staff is. It was far different and way better than any other barbershop or salon I've ever visited. Everyone here was welcoming and treated every visitor, myself included, like a part of their family.

Second, I was also pretty impressed by the variety of services they had at the salon. I thought it was just a hair salon, but -- to my surprise -- they actually function as a full-service salon. I noticed they do spa services and manicures as well.

Third, my haircut turned out great. As a male, I'm generally nervous trying out new hair salons because I'm not sure if they mostly specialize in women's hair styling or men's, but was pretty happy to see they actually have a really diverse customer base and are great at everything they do!

Having said that, I feel that Vintage Styles is a very unique salon and different from most in the Fremont area. Most of the places I'd heard about were more of the "here's your haircut, give us money" feeling. I didn't feel that with Sarah and Vintage Styles. I can tell the entire staff is very passionate about what they do, and they aren't happy until their customer's are.

Check them out. You'll have a hard time going to another salon after!</Text><date>1557616344638< /date>< Pics>

<Text>Sarah fitted slotted me in to do my hair over email as I was visiting from out of town and she did an absolutely amazing job.

I love wearing vintage styles and she captured my style perfectly in the set and brushout she did and if I lived locally I would most certainly be a regular!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1575447318834, 'text': 'Thank you so much, Jacqui!

< review>
I fell in love with the place right when I hit the door! The decor is wonderful. The owner and her team are extremely knowledgeable and precise. They are very helpful not only with their clients, but with one another as well. The personalities are very upbeat and friendly. You feel like your talking with your girlfriends(guy friends). I have found the perfect salon, and I will continue to keep coming back.
Vintage Salon also has an Esthetician who does facials, waxing, lashes and, body art. I have not made my appointment yet, but in the near future. I would highly recommend this salon.< /review>

My absolute favorite vape shop. Super helpful guys. Large selection of juices.  Good prices. Will price match other local shops. Bought 2 mod packages from them. And a bunch of juice as they sell the larger size (120ml) that I like.

I'm from out of town. Can't wait till I'm back in the area to stop by here again.<//text>

I had to buy because I was too lazy to buy quality juice online. They are stuped af. Wasted my hard earned money on these lieing scamming bums. Oh also they over price their devices that cost like $13 dollars online and selling it for around $45. These fools must be pocketing the owners money.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Worst.
They called me and blk was out of stock aafter 4days past since i ordered. They offer me red color and willing to send me extra pods for delay and wrong color. And? Yes never came extra pods and never reply me back. I choose this store cause they promised fast shipping. This is not even cheapest place to buy Caliburn. Never shop at this store again.< /text>

Always good to go in and talk to the people there for any vape stuff. They take the time to explain everything and give recommendations if you don't know what to get. Friendly environment and lots of choices to pick from, it's nice they got just about all the juices they sell as samples, either to drip or sample tanks. They also have good process and deals on everything.</text>

High prices, no hook ups. Told me my vape was broken so bought a new one for 40 even though I could get it for 23 online. Pretty sure my vape is fixable though, I was just in a rush.< /Text>

Workers provide some of the best customer service around. I have never been unsatisfied with any of my visits. I come here often, usually after work. Prices are very reasonable and they have specials all the time. Nice atmosphere and everyone is friendly. They have a wide selection of juice and equipment and put in the time to help me make a decision with their vast knowledge of vaping.< /Review>

Not that bad of a shop if you know what you want and you just go in to get it. Personally, haven't found a juice I actually liked from this place so I go elsewhere for that. But my advice and the reason I do not want to go any higher than 2 stars is... don't trust the employees!! Not gonna get into the couple reasons I have for that, but trust me, don't trust the employees!!<//Text>

He was extremely patient as I explained to him my unfortunate situation. I told him I only wanted to spend $100 today. I was so happy when he was able to set me up with a Smok tech Stick V8 and a bottle of Kings Cup for less than $70! Friendly and Affordable! I left a Happy Camper forsure!

< review>
Ive been sitting at my computer trying to write this review for almost an hour now, I just couldn't decide what i liked the most about this Shop! Im torn between their excellent service or their wide selection of products!
The second I walked in I was warmly welcomed by three cheerful employees (the place was packed btw, everyone was elbow to elbow) luckily they had a very large bar so the second I walked up, an employee approached me immediately ready to help me out. I was looking for juice and let me tell you these guys know their juices! They literally have shelves and shelves of different brands and flavor profiles! Even though they were extremely busy at the time, their employees had such good control of the room that I had tried plenty of flavors and had picked mine out (Blue Raspberry Dumpopz) in less than 20 minutes! I can safely say that I had an amazing first time and I will definitely come back!< /review>

The staff was extremely accomidating & just super cool. I'd bought a Groupon & my total was $5.55 in addition to my Groupon. Which they required in cash. Being that I only had $4.85 in cash on me, they let me slide on the $.70 that I was short of.... very cool!! Thanx!</Text>

Vape Street is easily the best Vape Shop in the city hands down. They have the biggest premium juce selection ive ever seen. They also have the biggest hardware selection ive ever seen. And on top of that they have the lowest prices in the city, and sometimes the pricing is even cheaper than you can find online! Besides all that, the employees are incredible, so knowledable and friendly. Seriously I dont understand why you would want to go anywhere else ! Wish I could give them more than 5 stars, cause they deserve it!<//Review>

Ive been to many vape shops around the area and most have them had mediocer service and i didnt feel invited when i walked in. I started visiting vapestreet and they were very imformative about their products and have the best prices arounnd the area. I always recommened my friends to stop by if they need any juice.<//review>

<rate>5</rate><review>The best experience ive had in a vape store so far i flew over from new zealand on holiday and looked for the best vape store in the area and found it in artesia. Although my emails in advance did not reach the store (the email address is only for the vegas store) the guys made up for it with excellent service they had almost everything i was looking for bar one or two flavors so they chucked in some freebees and let me try a ton of juice i spent up large and it was worth every cent. Even though i cant vist the store again anytime soon i will definatly be ordering online. Thanks vape street artesia.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<review>Bad customer service. Called in 30 minutes before i arrived there to ask if they had a specific product, was told there was 3 left. Drove from Carson to this location just to be told, " i thought we had 3" ,plus they one they wanted to sell me had a lot of equipment missing . Really bad customer service and waste of time. Plus waste of damn gas like really though .</review>< Pics>

It's A Dope Vape Shop, I just don't like the fact I have to spend 20 bucks and buy 5 coils when I just need one and yet they can't open a box and sell me one</Review>

On the afternoon of 5/9/21 I arrived in person and ordered an Italian Sub to go with everything except anything hot . The cashier verified my order, only called it a "Hero" (same thing). After 10 minutes (and $12) I got my sandwich. When I got home and opened it, it was just the fixings for a sandwich, NO BREAD. It was basically a salad. Oh yeah, and it had hot peppers.<//review>

It's a cool "neighborhood" spot... Don't expect restaurant chain type service, it's not a franchise... It's becoming more of a local bar and less of a family restaurant. Not sure I would drag my kids in with me but the food is good and the beer too. Realistic expectations are key here<//text>

Our server did not wear a mask, nor did the person inside preparing the food. The food preparer did not appear to be wearing gloves either.

Food was okay. Nothing exceptional. Have had worse have had better.
Until covid is in better check I will choose to stay away. Not enough precautions being taken to help stop the spread.</Text><response>None< /response><rating>3<//rating>< user>

Stopped in for lunch purely on a whim and was very pleasantly surprised. The pizza was very good, especially the crust. We had the meat lovers pizza and really enjoyed it. Service was very good and attentive. I'll be passing this place along to my friends in the area. Definitely worth it!<//Text>

Love the place!!! My wife and I loved the old “Pizza Place” but we are enjoying even more what the new owners at CJ’s have done. It’s a great neighborhood place for us to get away from the kids for a minute and to enjoy some adult time. It’s also a great place to go when we do decide to take the kiddos to pizza. Love the place!!! Thanks gentlemen for what you’re doing. Keep it up. We look forward to making it “ our place” for years to come.</text>

The pizzas had a thin crust the way we like but the toppings were generous. The mozzarella sticks were perfectly crispy outside and gooey inside. The staff were friendly and attentive. They made us feel really welcomed. We are definitely returning to try their other pizzas!</review><gmap_id>0x809b199707a3c2d1:0xd4bb24ff11abc112<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It's ok, good service, only average pizza.  Used to be a great pizza joint for lunch serving by the slice and had a salad bar, but now the vibe is more 'neighborhood bar' that serves pizza.  Which is cool and the service was very nice, it just wasn't what we were looking for that day.  Maybe another time after work!<//Review>

We returned due to new ownership and couldn’t have been happier. The food selection and quality is really good as well as the cold drinks and bar offerings. The owner was extremely friendly, service was good and there is an expectation that this isn’t a local “hangout” for kids whose parents are leaving them unattended after school. Excellent job taking charge and improving the atmosphere. Just wish more surrounding businesses would do the same. We will be back and recommending to neighbors and friends.<//review>< Pics>

<time>1567359574476< /time><rate>1</rate><text>I felt compelled to write on here as a potential new customer that now has been scared away from this restaurant.

My extended family & I were looking for a great place to meet up tonight for dinner. We used to frequently meet at Rocklin Pizza Place due to it's family vibe and convenient location nearby but hadn't been in a long time. We noticed it's now a new business. I've heard mixed reviews about the new ownership and establishment of CJ's Pizza Bar & Grill (some great and some very bad) so I haven't been feeling the urge to go but thought it could be time to try it tonight and form our own opinion. I had high hopes and was excited that it might be a great new place to have in our neighborhood.

However, after coming on here just now to look at the reviews (which I do for most new restaurants) and seeing the owners volatile responses to customers who have left reviews, my family will not be supporting this business. I have never seen such a thing where an owner attacks every negative review with such rudeness and hostility. If he is doing that on this forum what will he be like if there is a problem with our food order at the restaurant? I don't doubt that he'd yell at us to leave like some people have posted on here based on his attacks "while hiding behind his keyboard" as he keeps saying to these customers.

It's unfortunate as he could handle these reviews with grace and professionalism instead of attacking.  It's tacky, unprofessional, and tasteless. Maybe he's in the wrong industry of customer service. Any owner especially in the food industry who takes that approach will scare away business for new customers like myself-who like to check out reviews before trying a new restaurant. I understand you can't make everyone happy but there is some weight in their reviews and your response to them is very telling. Good luck.<//text>< Pictures>

I only appreciate those customers that do come in to speak with me in-person about their experience, good or bad.  As for me being hostile or volatile in my responses, I think you should educate yourself on those terms before using them.  As a 28 year retired sheriff sergeant, I have experienced hostile and volatile situations you cannot fathom.  You just cant handle the fact my replies to these baseless reviews are honest and direct. Please go enjoy yourself elsewhere, as I don't want customers who complain about something they've yet tried to experience."}</Response><GmapID>0x809b199707a3c2d1:0xd4bb24ff11abc112</GmapID></record>

They still have the “Pizza Place” sign. They shut down the The Pizza Place yelp because of all of the negative reviews! They are rude and used profanity with my daughter and her friend. My daughters friend bought in a Starbucks and was told she had to leave after they purchased a medium pizza. They refused to give them a refund  and  they had to leave. Our community needs to be aware of this horrible behavior. For years our families, schools, sport organizations have supported them. The old owners of the pizza place were successful because they treated EVERYONE with respect! This place will not last long.</review>

<review>HIDDEN GEM!!!
Living in Rocklin and always wanting a place to "watch the game" the new owners are clearly doing their best to make this spot a staple in the Rocklin community. I am so thankful to have found it and have currently been here for my "SJ Sharks" and "SF Giants" The staff is extremely nice and attentive and only seem to be improving this place. They recently got their liquor license which is also a huge.advantage to them coming in to the summer season. I can't wait to bring more friends and family.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1557425202719, 'text': "Appreciate your review and thank you for noticing the work we are putting in at CJ's!"}<//Resp><gmapID>0x809b199707a3c2d1:0xd4bb24ff11abc112</gmapID></record>

<Review>What kind of sad person leaves a 1 star review with no comment lol. This place is amazing. Hands down best pizza in Rocklin, no contest. Now that they have a full liquor license, it’s even better.

Besides having the best pizza, their sandwiches are AMAZING. The owners are friendly and fun to converse with. Not a better hang out spot in Rocklin.</Review><name>Chris May<//name>< UserId.>

I called and got a quote on how much it would be to get a ball out my charging port on my laptop. I was quoted free if real quick or 50 if he has to open it. Well he opened it. Took him about 20-30 minutes and gave me some advice on some other issues. He still decided not to charge me though. I gave him half for the good service and time.<//Review>

Brought in a laptop that I had previously been quoted $800 to repair at Geek Squad. Geek Squad held my laptop for a month before telling me they needed to replace the motherboard on my fairly new laptop for a Wi-Fi adapter malfunction. Took it to Laptop Masters and they fixed the issue quickly. For a fraction of the price that Geek Squad quoted me I received: my laptop in working order with no issues, an education of why these issues occur, and a place I can trust with all of my electronic issues I cannot solve on my own. I HIGHLY recommend bringing your electronics here. Check out the other projects they are working on like pinball machines.<//review>

<review>Extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I have been taking my laptop to multiple shops for months trying to figure out why it won’t charge properly. I spent a ton of money on chargers and new batteries. I decided to try one more place, Laptop Masters, and they were able to easily find and fix the issue. The man working, so sorry I didn’t catch his name, even showed me what the issue was and sure enough he was right!

This place is fast and professional with reasonable prices. Don’t waste your time going elsewhere, do yourself a favor and just go to Laptop Masters first. Now I have my favorite laptop back! Thanks so much for the help 😁< /review><rating>5<//rating><name>Kaylee Nagle< /name>< UserId.>

Honest good work and prices. I know it is in human nature to take something you don't understand as hostile, but just because you don't understand doesn't mean they're trying to trick you. They just want to figure out the best way to help you, get payed, and move on.< /text>

I brought in my gaming pc after doing a few hardware upgrades but then couldn't get it to turn on. I tried a few different things but I still couldn't get it to work.

I delved into the PC servicemen in the area and their shop caught my eye. I viewed a custom watercooled PC in one of their pictures so I figured they had the expertise I was looking for.

Spencer was able to deduce the issue in less then 45 minutes and he had my computer up and running in no time. We also had a great discussion about newer tech that will be hitting the market soon.

My experience here was nothing short of fantastic and I highly recommend this shop to anyone looking the get into PC gaming or DIY PCs in general.

The Laptop Masters certainly live up to their title, and have earned a dedicated customer.<//Review>< Pics>

Went to laptop masters for the first time over a year ago but a different guy was working there. The first time I went there a different guy fixed my laptop and it was working good for about 7 months then it stopped working. I took it back to laptop masters but the same guy doesn't seem to work there anymore.
I was told my ports were burned out and that i needed a new motherboard. I was charged 200 bucks. The ports are still out and therefore I recieved no new motherboard. I think I was ripped off and Im not sure why. I thought i could trust this service but its obvious I can not. The new people working there don't seem as trustworthy. Go elsewhere if you can.< /Text>

<Text>Great business. Took in my sons MacBook Pro, the keyboard and track pad stopped working. After a few days in the shop they informed me that all they had to do was an in depth cleaning and that solved the problem. They charged me a minimal amount. They could have said they replaced the keyboard or any other part, and they could have charged me whatever they wanted, but they didn’t. They are a business with integrity, great customer service and they absolutely know what they are doing. I will always take my computers and electronics for repair to Laptop Masters. Highly recommend them.<//Text>< resp>

I was having major issues with my laptop. It was not turning on and it was making weird noises. The man I talked to was super helpful and gained my confidence in his services.

<Text>Super nice guys! I called on the weekend explaining my computer was having over heating issues and no other repair shop would look at a laptop. I also explained that due to school and work I cant leave my laptop some place for days waiting just for a diagnosis. He said bring it in monday around noon. I brought it in and the gentlemen there were very polite. Tried to help me diagnose the issue. They gave me advice on what to do as opening it could void the warranty. They tweaked the setting and helped me a ton. These guys are awesome! Nice to have a family buisness near by for tech support.< /Text><date>1595376517121<//date><name>David Lane</name></record>

Like most everyone else, BestBuy quoted me way too much. Went to Laptop Masters and am SO happy I did. Instead of $400 at BestBuy I paid $80 here. They are honest, provide quality work, are very friendly and knowledgeable. I’m very happy I went and will continue to go with any future tech issues. Definitely recommend.</Review>

This place is great! We had a laptop that wouldn’t power on. We took it to Best Buy/Geeksquad, but they wouldn’t diagnose it without sending it in to their service center in Kentucky (minimum charge of $84 just to look at it). Instead, we took it to Laptop Masters and Cesar was able to get it up and running in less than 5 minutes without needing to purchase any additional parts. We will definitely be coming back here for any other tech related needs!< /Text>

<review>Dropped my sisters laptop while it was charging and the entire charger port fell out and didnt want to turn on anymore. Brought it in and they took it apart and fixed it right in front of me and explained step by step what went wrong and how it was a simple and easy fix all while answering all my questions. All in all, Great service, awesome clean shop.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< rating>

Laptop Masters are true professionals. Based on a recommendation from a friend, I visited the team to repair a broken screen on my laptop and to take a look at my wife's sluggish laptop. They were able to quickly diagnose the issues, order the parts needed, and make the repairs, all for a great price! They also explained the causes and offered some advice on how to prevent the problems moving forward. They even cleaned the laptops! I will definitely come back for any of my laptop needs. Laptop Masters also help build PC's, which is great!</text>

I came in with my laptop and right away Spencer knew what he was doing. He carefully inspected the hardware pieces that needed to be replaced and looked at the pricing options for what's out there. What I appreciate was that he provided multiple options, including what was most cost effective, especially for someone like me who just graduated from college. Spencer definitely works with your preferences and helps educate you along the way with your laptop questions! Thank you Laptop Masters!< /text>

My laptop was freezing on the login page, and the techs at laptop masters fixed the issue, sped up my operating system, and charged much less than I expected. I will definitely return whenever I have computer problems in the future.<//Text>

My Lenovo laptop has shorted by a single water drop. I was very worried because other shops told me this laptop is over. Then I came to this shop, the technicians and engineers are very professional, they confidently told me this can be repaired. And they have repaired a lot laptops with water issues. They replaced the SD card board which is short and caused the whole problem. They also cleaned the entire laptop and diagnosed everything else. The price is very reasonable, part cost is market price and about 40 bucks for diagnostic. Better than most other shops who only recommend you to buy a new one.</Text>

This place is amazing. I brought two of my computers in for repairs that I had given up hope on and they cleans out all the dust reinstalled windows  on one of my computers and figured out what was wrong with my other computer as well and then upgraded it as well. They were knowledgeable and kept me informed of the process and what happened the whole way through. I highly recommend Laptop Masters for any problems you have with your pc.<//Text>

I had a trouble that I just didnt have the resources to get done and they got it done as soon as they could even with me pestering them the whole time. They get their projects done in a fast pace and help as much as they could. They also keep a nice conversation when it comes to waiting so you won’t have to worry about being bored there. Overall I would go back if I had any problems. Great computer shop.<//Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I highly recommend this electronic and computer repair store. I came into the store with my Chromebook 11 c740 that was stuck on a screen that said chrome OS is missing or damaged. And when I try to put the recovery utility image with the flash drive it then went to unexpected error. So I had to fix the hard drive in the Chromebook and when I came into the store Spencer helped me out and fixed my computer the same day. Customer service is excellent here very friendly environment very good in price. If you need your computer fixed don't go anywhere else but here at laptop Master. It's very professional and this computer repair store knows what they're doing.<//Text>< pictures>

I called and got a quote on how much it would be to get a ball out my charging port on my laptop. I was quoted free if real quick or 50 if he has to open it. Well he opened it. Took him about 20-30 minutes and gave me some advice on some other issues. He still decided not to charge me though. I gave him half for the good service and time.< /review>

Brought in a laptop that I had previously been quoted $800 to repair at Geek Squad. Geek Squad held my laptop for a month before telling me they needed to replace the motherboard on my fairly new laptop for a Wi-Fi adapter malfunction. Took it to Laptop Masters and they fixed the issue quickly. For a fraction of the price that Geek Squad quoted me I received: my laptop in working order with no issues, an education of why these issues occur, and a place I can trust with all of my electronic issues I cannot solve on my own. I HIGHLY recommend bringing your electronics here. Check out the other projects they are working on like pinball machines.</Text>

Extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I have been taking my laptop to multiple shops for months trying to figure out why it won’t charge properly. I spent a ton of money on chargers and new batteries. I decided to try one more place, Laptop Masters, and they were able to easily find and fix the issue. The man working, so sorry I didn’t catch his name, even showed me what the issue was and sure enough he was right!

This place is fast and professional with reasonable prices. Don’t waste your time going elsewhere, do yourself a favor and just go to Laptop Masters first. Now I have my favorite laptop back! Thanks so much for the help 😁</Text>

Honest good work and prices. I know it is in human nature to take something you don't understand as hostile, but just because you don't understand doesn't mean they're trying to trick you. They just want to figure out the best way to help you, get payed, and move on.< /Review>

Nothing short of exemplary service and expertise.

I brought in my gaming pc after doing a few hardware upgrades but then couldn't get it to turn on. I tried a few different things but I still couldn't get it to work.

I delved into the PC servicemen in the area and their shop caught my eye. I viewed a custom watercooled PC in one of their pictures so I figured they had the expertise I was looking for.

Spencer was able to deduce the issue in less then 45 minutes and he had my computer up and running in no time. We also had a great discussion about newer tech that will be hitting the market soon.

My experience here was nothing short of fantastic and I highly recommend this shop to anyone looking the get into PC gaming or DIY PCs in general.

The Laptop Masters certainly live up to their title, and have earned a dedicated customer.</text>

Went to laptop masters for the first time over a year ago but a different guy was working there. The first time I went there a different guy fixed my laptop and it was working good for about 7 months then it stopped working. I took it back to laptop masters but the same guy doesn't seem to work there anymore.
I was told my ports were burned out and that i needed a new motherboard. I was charged 200 bucks. The ports are still out and therefore I recieved no new motherboard. I think I was ripped off and Im not sure why. I thought i could trust this service but its obvious I can not. The new people working there don't seem as trustworthy. Go elsewhere if you can.<//Text>

Great business. Took in my sons MacBook Pro, the keyboard and track pad stopped working. After a few days in the shop they informed me that all they had to do was an in depth cleaning and that solved the problem. They charged me a minimal amount. They could have said they replaced the keyboard or any other part, and they could have charged me whatever they wanted, but they didn’t. They are a business with integrity, great customer service and they absolutely know what they are doing. I will always take my computers and electronics for repair to Laptop Masters. Highly recommend them.< /text>

I was having major issues with my laptop. It was not turning on and it was making weird noises. The man I talked to was super helpful and gained my confidence in his services. He was professional & honest. The price was also reasonable and my laptop was fixed the same day. Would highly recommend coming here< /review>

<Text>Super nice guys! I called on the weekend explaining my computer was having over heating issues and no other repair shop would look at a laptop. I also explained that due to school and work I cant leave my laptop some place for days waiting just for a diagnosis. He said bring it in monday around noon. I brought it in and the gentlemen there were very polite. Tried to help me diagnose the issue. They gave me advice on what to do as opening it could void the warranty. They tweaked the setting and helped me a ton. These guys are awesome! Nice to have a family buisness near by for tech support.</Text>< user_name>

I dropped my laptop and broke the screen and shell. I brought my computer in to these guys 2 minutes before they closed. Not only did they spend the time with me after closing shop, but they also took the time to find out through the Dell website that I actually have accidental coverage through Dell and could send my computer to them to be repaired at no charge. HONESTY the BEST policy. Can’t thank them enough they just saved me $400.< /review>

<review>Like most everyone else, BestBuy quoted me way too much. Went to Laptop Masters and am SO happy I did. Instead of $400 at BestBuy I paid $80 here. They are honest, provide quality work, are very friendly and knowledgeable. I’m very happy I went and will continue to go with any future tech issues. Definitely recommend.<//review>< pictures>

This place is great! We had a laptop that wouldn’t power on. We took it to Best Buy/Geeksquad, but they wouldn’t diagnose it without sending it in to their service center in Kentucky (minimum charge of $84 just to look at it). Instead, we took it to Laptop Masters and Cesar was able to get it up and running in less than 5 minutes without needing to purchase any additional parts. We will definitely be coming back here for any other tech related needs!<//text>

Dropped my sisters laptop while it was charging and the entire charger port fell out and didnt want to turn on anymore. Brought it in and they took it apart and fixed it right in front of me and explained step by step what went wrong and how it was a simple and easy fix all while answering all my questions. All in all, Great service, awesome clean shop.</Text>

<text>Laptop Masters are true professionals. Based on a recommendation from a friend, I visited the team to repair a broken screen on my laptop and to take a look at my wife's sluggish laptop. They were able to quickly diagnose the issues, order the parts needed, and make the repairs, all for a great price! They also explained the causes and offered some advice on how to prevent the problems moving forward. They even cleaned the laptops! I will definitely come back for any of my laptop needs. Laptop Masters also help build PC's, which is great!< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c3315c6a216d7d:0xdf0e918251798616<//Gmap_id>< Name>

I came in with my laptop and right away Spencer knew what he was doing. He carefully inspected the hardware pieces that needed to be replaced and looked at the pricing options for what's out there. What I appreciate was that he provided multiple options, including what was most cost effective, especially for someone like me who just graduated from college. Spencer definitely works with your preferences and helps educate you along the way with your laptop questions! Thank you Laptop Masters!<//Text>

<pics>None<//pics><review>My Lenovo laptop has shorted by a single water drop. I was very worried because other shops told me this laptop is over. Then I came to this shop, the technicians and engineers are very professional, they confidently told me this can be repaired. And they have repaired a lot laptops with water issues. They replaced the SD card board which is short and caused the whole problem. They also cleaned the entire laptop and diagnosed everything else. The price is very reasonable, part cost is market price and about 40 bucks for diagnostic. Better than most other shops who only recommend you to buy a new one.</review>< rate>

<Text>This place is amazing. I brought two of my computers in for repairs that I had given up hope on and they cleans out all the dust reinstalled windows  on one of my computers and figured out what was wrong with my other computer as well and then upgraded it as well. They were knowledgeable and kept me informed of the process and what happened the whole way through. I highly recommend Laptop Masters for any problems you have with your pc.</Text>< pics>

I had a trouble that I just didnt have the resources to get done and they got it done as soon as they could even with me pestering them the whole time. They get their projects done in a fast pace and help as much as they could. They also keep a nice conversation when it comes to waiting so you won’t have to worry about being bored there. Overall I would go back if I had any problems. Great computer shop.<//Review>

I highly recommend this electronic and computer repair store. I came into the store with my Chromebook 11 c740 that was stuck on a screen that said chrome OS is missing or damaged. And when I try to put the recovery utility image with the flash drive it then went to unexpected error. So I had to fix the hard drive in the Chromebook and when I came into the store Spencer helped me out and fixed my computer the same day. Customer service is excellent here very friendly environment very good in price. If you need your computer fixed don't go anywhere else but here at laptop Master. It's very professional and this computer repair store knows what they're doing.<//text>

Good place for quick meal or take out. Order steak and cheese (toasted) with flat bread. Add American cheese, jalapenos, olives, lettuce, ranch and sweet onion sauce. thats a heavenly tasting recipe!< /review>

I did an online order and picked it up and they got my orders wrong. I was fine with it but my husband wasn't he decided to give them a call and the worker who answered was being very disrespectful and laughing telling another worker that his order was wrong then told him to bring it in and they would fix it. Once my husband got there she told him “Why didn't you just take out all the ingredients that you don't like and eat it? I Will not be going back.

<Review>Perfect place to grab your quick meals if you are in a rush. A wide variety of delicious sandwiches and the stuff here are very nice. I love dining here since we can also have some quick chats with my friends. I hope that COVID ends soon so that we can dine anywhere we want again and spend some time together.<//Review>< Time>

<user_id>111766019925366525616<//user_id><Text>I recently ordered online and was told it would be ready by 10:45. When  I came to pick up my order at 11:00 it wasn't ready so I had to wait (which included having to listen to this employee complaing about her boyfriend).  When I got home the sandwiches were missing half the toppings. When I  called back to let them know about it the young woman began acting rude over the telephone.  It was the worse customer service I've ever experienced.  A simple apology would have been nice but this young lady started acting like it was my fault or something. After some back and forth I actually got her to admit ,yes indeed she forgot the toppings, but was met with more of the same abrasive attitude. Maybe it's just me ,but being belittled by a sandwich maker (who can't even get that right)is a new low.< /Text>< Pictures>

This place has a wide variety of fast food meals that taste delicious. Nothing is microwaved or reheated and everything has quality ingredients considering it's fast food. The pastrami burger is by far my favorite and the way it's presented is flawless. The orders come out pretty quickly. There's a lot of condiments inside. This is the SPOT in LCR! Affordable prices too.< /text>

<Text>A pleasant little winery we stumbled upon! The cab Capo Grande was absolutely delicious and I'm not even a huge wino. Nice ambiance, indoor and outdoor, one the most happening places in the area it looked like. We custom made a pizza per request and was very yummy.

Best place in San Juan Cap and now San Clemente. Adrian the chef is amazing. Staff are great, food is great, wine is great. Wine selection has greatly improved over the last year or two as the switched vendors. Highly suggest the Brussel sprouts, pot roast pasta, and lamb sliders.</text>

My favorite buffet place! Always visit whenever we are in Vegas. So many dishes to choose and the freshness of oyster and crab legs are no doubt! It's really a buffet place for everyone, for those who likes a glass (or two) wine (or beer) with their food, wine - mimosa and beer are included. For those who has a sweet tooth like me - desserts sections are heavenly, you name it.. from pizza, pasta, salad, fried chicken, mac n cheese, prime rib, asian, soups, fresh oysters, crab legs, they are all in there. But be aware.. their seafood buffet only on Friday night, and all day for Saturdays and Sundays. Tips.. come on Friday around 1.30-ish so you get to pay for Brunch price, and by 2.30pm they already change the menu to seafood buffet. But why come at 1.30 you asked? Because the line is no joke!</text>

Very slow making orders. Especially during lunch rush. Customers come in with 10 sandwich orders but don't know what goes on the sandwich, should be pushed back until they can get the info. Wont return to this subway. Lack of customer service<//review>

<review>We're from Vegas and this is the BEST McDonald's hands down! Super fast and friendly service. They confirm your order and deliver it with a smile. Fresh French fries, better menu options then back home, and they get your order right.< /review><name>Shawn Gonzalez<//name></record></dataset><record>

Great wines and beer. Excellent happy hour! Menu could step it up a bit--there's a certain blandness to the palette, perhaps because they don't want the food to overpower the wine.</review>

Very delicious!!! They got an A on their food inspection, their cookies looked amazing, and they even labeled our sandwiches. Both employees were nice and friendly. Candace was super awesome. Best of all when I asked for LOTS of pickles, she gave me just that!  I'm very grateful ♡</review>

<review>This place has a wide variety of fast food meals that taste delicious. Nothing is microwaved or reheated and everything has quality ingredients considering it's fast food. The orders come out pretty quickly. There's a lot of condiments inside. This is the SPOT in LCR! Affordable prices too.
What an amazing hidden gem located in Montrose! This restaurant specializes in Nashville Style Fried Chicken that is made fresh to order. I came here over the weekend with a group of people and had the luxury to taste the food.
The Fried Chicken is absolutely delicious. The chicken was very moist and tender. You can adjust the spicy level from no spice all the way up to blazin. You can order the chicken as a slider or a tender with sides of fries and cole slaw.
The staff is very friendly and attentive and will help you guide through the process. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who is in need of good food!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Pizza was super fresh with good dough, great cheese and some of the freshest tomato sauce I've ever had on pizza.

Magically thus $18(go before 2:30 pm) takes you to unbelievably tender Tri Tip. Great Prime Rib. Wow Kabi ribs so Heavenly. Meatballs are a must have. Fresh Gourmet Baked Cookies. And 200 other food items. Cource you can go at Dinner time but pay more. We were there just playing slots, got hungry for Late Lunch, and hit the Lunch-Dinner Transition. $18___ We were there Wed Oct 2. So don't know what B-buffet's Friday's Prime Rib day is. Sad to say we finished our meal before they brought the Whole Roasted Pig out to the Carving/Pork Chopping station.<//text>

Went here for lunch a quick lunch w/friends and it was great. I ordered the Pearl burger with avo and frings. The patties was a nice thick and juicy and the bun and lettuce were great! The place itself is small and not very much seating for customers but it's honestly not that bad.<//Review>

2/28/20 @ about 5:50 we got really bad service(I put the date & time b/c those employees were the worst). We waited for the other customs(was not bothered by that). When it was our turn, they FINALLY did an order from a Customer that ordered online & the receipt was there the whole time we were there. Then the other employee asks the people from BEHIND us their order, so we waited a while longer. After a few minutes we said “who’s helping us?” & the employees started talking to each other but NEVER did our order.They also were dropping many things on the floor & on other foods, even hair. Another reason is b/c we waited about 45 min for nothing.< /text>

2nd UPDATE: They now have curbside pick up for those of us with immuno-compromised family!  YAYA! So happy that we have such a good sandwich place here in town.

UPDATE: They've brought back the fresh avocado!!!  YAYAYA!!!

What's right: staff is always so friendly and they bake the bread properly (allowing the baking trays/molds to dry completely before using them with the dough). If they change the temp and stop freezing the veggies, this would be a 5-star place!!</Text>

<review>To the man working July 1st at 6:30pm extremely relatable and you had great customer service! Plus the sandwich was probably the most evenly spread least messy-and-all-over the place sandwich I have gotten from subway in a long time. I'm bringing you a tip next time brotha!< /review>< pictures>

< Review>
Sunday evening, March 11, 2018
Alyssa, my granddaughter, and I went to Subway for our "healthy, fast food" splurge/treat.  Upon arrival, we saw a sign stating Subway was CLOSED DUE TO TECH DIFFICULTIES.  THERE WAS AN EMPLOYEE INSIDE BUT HE OFFERED NO EXPLANATION.</Review>

I been to many subways in my life but this one has some great workers. TONY and TREYVON were great! They were super friendly greeted everyone who entered the door. When we got there about 10 more people showed up. They greeted all of them with bright smiles and treated everyone with respect including the kids. They gave the perfect amount of food on the subs unlike most subways that gives a small portion. I highly recommend this subway if your a fan of subway especially if TONY AND TREYVON are working. If we didn't live 45 minutes away we'd come back here all the time.< /review>

Absolutely awesome customer service skills. I called ahead to ask about a salad and was told everything I needed to know! I was greeted when I came in and realized they were pretty low on bread. They helped make sure I was still able to get the food I needed and even offered a suggestion or two of what to try in the future! Huge shout out to Jalon. He was the person who helped me get through my complicated order. He was extremely professional and helped me every step of the way. He was able to remember all the veggies we needed on my sandwiches and deal with five subs and a salad. He at no point let the big order frustrate him and he handled everything like a boss. If you get the chance to be helped by this man, don't forget to write a review for the incredible experience you're sure to have!! Kudos to you man, keep up the good work and take care!< /Text>

Today I went to this store for a technical issue. I've tried debugging my self, calling customer service for an hour but couldn't get any progress. A young black male employee in the store(Sorry I should have asked the name but was in a hurry and forgot to ask) helped out and quickly figured out the issue. The guy is very smart and helpful. Much more helpful than the robot caller customer service. Comcast should really award think about to hire and reward more people like him rather than relying on the dumb robot service. The robot caller just can get stuck into some corner case for very long time and drive people crazy.</text>

Awesome flawless experience. Came here for equipment return. It was a weekday midday so was not crowded. Was helped by a lady who was pretty quick and we had a good chat about languages kids are learning nowadays. I opted it of Comcast but still it was a happy ending.< /Review>

<review>I signed up for service, was given a modem that didn't work, called tech support they told me my modem is too old that's why it's not picking the signal. Requested me to get a replacement from store, I went back. Got another modem, same story. It's been 8days now and iam literally just helping them test their equipment. I think they should test them before handing them to clients. Iam on modem 3, and 8days wasted yet no internet yet they have already charged my credit card.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>Overall good experience, they took all the required safety measures and guidelines to address COVID situations. I went to store to update my service and pick xfi modem. First I was sent to a lady inside the store, she is not that welcoming but addressed the queries, later I was sent to another staff member, he is welcoming but took more time than expected.</Review>< pics>

<Text>I had a great experience at the Comcast store today. The socially distanced line out side worked efficiently and when my turn came, service was excellent - I was able to return an old modem and explore options to reduce my monthly bill, ultimately leading to a modem upgrade to the latest and fastest, saving over $100/mo.<//Text></record>

Hope you never have any billing issues.
I moved and cancelled with confirmation. About a month later I get a large bill (with late fee). Then I got to spend the afternoon on hold trying to correct it. I thought I was finished until they said I still had balance. Turns out they conveniently had a much later stop service date (save your emails folks). With that accepted, now I'm just waiting on a mailing to confirm everything is complete.

Good thing I didn't trust them with auto-pay.

Some of the staff was a bit rude but overall an okay experience. If your rates change you have to update your current charges/rates whenever you knotice your internet slower speeds on your own accord. They don't do it on their own and will continue to charge you old rates and provide slower internet speeds.</review>

Knowing this, their CSRs are not the most pleasant, informed, or motivated to help. I went to 3 stores searching for a 4K cable box because each store told me they were out and couldn't call any of the other stores or view their inventory.

All this AFTER being told by a phone sales rep I'd have to find one in store because that's the only way to get one and they don't ship them.

At the 3rd store I was told I should just call the 800 number to have one sent to me 😡</Review>< username>

Very accommodating and quick.  During covid, my whole family is using much more wifi and I have some dead spots in my house.  The xfinity website didn't have Pods available.  The store had them!!  I was in and out in less than 7 minutes.
Friendly staff and quick!</review>

<Review>I've had nothing but excellent service from Xfinity Store by Comcast. Installation was painless; I was up and running in no time. Upload and download speeds have been consistently above the advertised rates. I've had virtually no interruptions in service -- definitely a huge improvement over Comcast. And everyone I've dealt with at the company has been friendly and helpful.</Review><GmapID>0x808fb675d8da9ec5:0xf59bb60cffd54f44<//GmapID><username>Henrietta Compton< /username>< rating>

Great customer service. Not sure why this place has low reviews but we were able to get our modem and service within 20 minutes. Very friendly staff and they explained everything we needed to know to get internet set up in our new apartment. Great place with free Wi-Fi and TVs to watch.

Edit: when we had issues with our modem, we called customer service, who came by and fixed the issue by giving us a new modem and inspecting the cords, all free of charge. Again, great service!</text>

Seems like the guy was picked out from the street and put at a customer facing job. I drive 30 minutes  to return an equipment as directed by the customer service [by phone]. Customer service guy asked me pick a certain model because my internet speed was extremely slow. The store guy refused to give me that equipment, started arguing, and calling his own customer service as mis-informed. He even agreed that I should cancel my service if I desire so. Rather fixing the issue. Almost same attitude from the store manager Rxxx. I feel like insulted and a foolish after talking to these guys. I feel like having an experience at a cheap business with an attitude of "this is what you gotta get otherwise let me show you the door". By the way, store had a long list of protocol for employees during COVID. The store manager and many employees were NOT even wearing face masks.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I came to your store at Sunnyvale CA on Thursday October 10th  and was attended by Chris at 7:35 pm. The guy asked me what needed and I told him I needed to return some equipment because I got a different plan. He just received the devices, never talked to me by my name, he only gave me the router, and I needed to ask for the Flex box that was part of the deal. Poor customer service and he was more interested watching the game on the side TV than offer me a good experience there. The other guy on the first desk didn't even welcomed me into the store, and the 3rd guy (bearded young guy) was busy giving to a lady a good service explaining her what to do with their new equipment. I'm a customer since 8 years ago and I didn't expect to have a poor experience getting this new deal with your company, because all the excellent on the phone customer service I got during the process went down hill with this kind of representatives in your store.<//Review>

<review>BE AWARE: they will keep charging you even you have canceled the service, and they will not stop no matter how many time they canceled the service.

I canceled the service 3 months ago, Xfinity mobile still kept and keeps charging me. I already made 3 attempts to dispute the charges:
1. 1st time, to cancel the service, and the other side told me it has been canceled.
2. 2nd time, I got charged again, and called them, they told me, oh, oops, we thought you meant suspend, and they canceled it again. It was then truly canceled since I cannot even access my account anymore.
3. 3rd time, still getting charged even without the service. I called them again.
And the cycle continues.</review>< resp>

Fantastic service, lovely location and friendly staff would be the best summary for this place. It was a busy Monday evening and there was a long queue of customers but service partner in the store registered all of us one a 1:1 basis. Followed by faster than expected turnaround time for each individual. The service partner was super friendly and helped with my order super quickly and also helped fix a potential issue without even asking. Would recommend this store to nearly residents for all things XFINITY!</Review>

There isn’t a system to who gets help first. A person who arrived after me got helped right away while I ended up waiting longer than needed. When I was assisted, it was a quick return, however, it did not make up for unwelcoming or unfriendly staff. I would not return here again. This is my second attempt to use this Xfinity store. Similar experience in waiting and unclear system of getting help. I attempted coming here again because person who helped me out the first visit to this store ended up being nice and friendly. However, I’ve been to much friendlier and helpful Xfinity stores, such that they had you check in and would call you when you were next, ensuring you were seen in a timely and efficient manner.<//review>

Surprisingly efficient for device-swaps.
They have a good system of queuing and processing customers needing to / advised to swap their equipment, or even surrender. Quite quick way of referencing the equipment (on-device qr-code un/binding to customer)</Text>

The worst service. Everything the sales rep told me was wrong and I had to clear it up with the corporate office. So much hassle because the sales rep had no idea what he is talking about.

<Text>STAY AWAY FROM COMCAST WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND ALL YOUR BEING!!!! Evil, thy name is Comcast. I cancelled my account MONTHS ago!  AND they're still billing me for funds I do not owe. I tried EVERY single avenue to resolve the matter with their customer service. But idiot me, I finally managed to speak with a supervisor who said they weren't willing to fix the issue. Way to go Comcast!!! You sure are the BEST at resolving issues. Now, I'm going to have to file a suit with my local small claims court because the drones at Comcast don't actually listen to their customers or make an effort to have some kind of understanding or meaningful dialogue. Stay away, stay away....I cannot, with all my heart, alert all of you to just simply stay away from this miserable institution. Call someone else...ANYONE else...at the very least they'll at least LIE to you to help you feel like you're getting the attention you deserve as a customer. DON'T RUIN YOUR CREDIT SCORE by patronizing this company!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>We came into the store and wanted to start a new service. But they offered a higher price than when I checked online, and I asked them to adjust the price. The guy wo helped me changed his attitude drastically after adjusting the price. He did not confirm the address or anything with me, and refused to print any form of receipt for me. I told him that I have not received the confirmation email and was wondering if he could print out a copy for me, but he said "there is nothing to print" and did not print anything for me.<//Review>< Pictures>

We often visit this store, everytime we get good response, but this time it's very bad. The person by name Mr.Arash was so rude, if we ask any question he can't answer instead he insults us by saying something. Very worst experience and rude behavior of this person.Very bad attitude of this person< /Text>

I spent today a 30 min driving to Xfinity to move my line from old Apple Watch to new Apple Watch, they told me , that they cannot do it from the Store, I have to call to Customer Support and only Customer Support can help me. I spent 30 min to talk with 3 people from the Customer Support and finally they (Ross 7063) told me that I have to go to Xfinity Store because they cannot do it from the phone , ......now I have to go to the Store again , how much time I should spend before somebody can move the line from Watch 3 to Watch 4?!</Text>

<Review>Worst service ever! The store is the worst. This is just a sales store so if you have any issue they won't help you, they will try to sell you something e.g. a new rental modem if your connection is not working, rather than checking or fixing the issue. You are better off talking to the Xfinity representatives on phone. The store people are not professional at all, very rude if they are not able to sell you something.<//Review>< Rate>

I needed a HD box for my Internet service so to avoid paying $70 for a house call, I drove to the Xfinity store to pick up the package. I was there at 11 AM, and the store was hardly busy. I was in and out in 5 minutes. Staff was friendly and the girl even smiled at me.<//review>

If you want the best deal, go into the store and deal directly with customer service. Especially if your term is up and looking to renew.
Employees are knowledgeable and will give you their best possible deal when asked.
Parking is limited so it's best to go around 10 am weekdays if possible.</Text>

Long waiting times, nobody greets you upon arrival even though some staff are just roaming. You need to register yourself in order to be called upon. There are no proper signage and We had our service almost after 15 mins of waiting. After we got a representative they told us about an upgrade offer for internet ( broadband) which let's us access xstream for an extra 4$ in every month and we thought ok. But later when we reached home we got a message that it was amounting to extra 22$ with all taxes and stuff. My husband had to revisit the center to get it cancelled. I didn't like the fact that they are trying to sell off upgrades with wrong prices.< /review>

If I could give negative star I would. Just spent 3 hours of my life I will never get back trying to connect X Pods. After one hour the first rep said I needed to reboot my iPhone and she would call back in 10 min but did not. 30 min later I called and spoke with another rep but still no success. Will try to exchange Pods this evening but my patience will be much less.<//review>

The seating was comfortable, and the person who greeted me came over to take me to the right counter, where I was promptly, politely served.

It's always nice to have a company exceed expectations.<//Text>< Resp>

Tired of paying a high monthly bill and thinking about that advertisement you got in the mail from a competing ISP? Consider paying a visit to your local Xfinity store and asking for a deal to slash your cost. I was pleasantly surprised (and my wait time was less than 10 minutes).<//Review>

I was pleasantly surprised by this store. They have a great system set up for times when they are busy. Staff was very friendly and eager to help. I was fortunate to go on a slow time and was in and out in minuutes with problem resolved. I will definitely go here next time rather  then trying to deal with them over the phone.<//Review>

<Review>I placed an order online and confirmed it over phone. The store didnt find it.
I was told my device shipping fee would be waived if i went to a store location. Didn't happen.
I was told they would honor the online promotion and even showed 3 staff members. They didn't honor it.

The store manager clocked out in the middle of helping me.

I just wanted to order internet service. It felt like every staff member was actively trying to get rid of me.  After 30 mins of not being helped and employees dodging questions I had to resubmit my order in front of them with my phone.</Review>< Pictures>

Horrible customer experience! Three service people on their desk doing nothing. None of them check on me or even make an eye contacy with me..
I am here to return equipment, hello  can you guys notice me? Ok.. l walked up to one of them, he totally made me feel like l was anoiying him with my present.
Xfinity can you train your staff to welcome customers as soon as we enter your locations? After you got my money for over 9 years at least made feel l paid off for some quality service.< /text>

What can I say that hasn't already been said? Signing up for service and getting it installed should not be more painful than a root canal, but with Comcast, it always is. If you still want to deal with this company, get everything in writing and note the names of the people you dealt with, both in person and on the phone. They love to make promises, but keeping them? Not so much.</text>

What can I say, other then Comcast has always been a horrible service provider, and this place just proves it. I went there to collect a modem, the agent immediately handed me one and I was out of there in less than two minutes. I was extremely impressed - until I went home and was unable to get it to work. The genius had given me the wrong model, I had to make a second trip to exchange it. Zero stars for zero competence would have been more appropriate.</text>

<Review>Does anyone on the customer service line/chat line speak English?  I just purchased a new modem, but before I did, I talked to a rep to see if it would be compatible.  They told me it was; however, they failed to tell me that this modem would be obsolete in a year and that I would have to purchase a new one.  I only found out because when I checked my account online, it says my device in not compatible.  It's been 2 weeks since I got the new modem.  You would think they would have suggested a different modem that would last longer than a year.  What a total waste of my time trying to get some answers from a customer service rep today.  So disappointed.  Definitely going with a different carrier after my 12 months is up.  Hire ENGLISH speaking people who live in AMERICA PLEASE!!!!!!

They take what is already a terrible experience (long wait times, customer service reps who are unable/not allowed to deviate from the script, inconvenient hours) and make it even more soul-sucking. During the long wait, overwhelmingly upbeat children's television programming plays and mocks you for thinking you were going to install Internet without a hitch.< /text>

High Customer-focus - Excellent Service
I know.  Comcast.  Say the word, and people start complaining.  Not me.  I've been to this Xfinity Store several times.  Mostly to do with my mother's account.  (She has Alzheimer's, a cruel disease.)  This store allowed me to downgrade her remote to a simple device that had few buttons on it without issue. I really appreciated that.

Every time I went to this outlet,  I was always treated well with friendly and courtesy staff.  The system to login and a wait your turn is efficient and techy.  Good job there.

I especially appreciate Comcast for its technicians that have come to my mother's assisted living quarters to set things up.  They have been great!  One technician even had his own mother suffer through Alzheimer's, so he knew what to expect and how to deal with situation.  Now that goes for above and beyond customer service.< /text>

<text>I would boycott this company if I could. 2 guys greet me when I go to their desk. I wait 30 minutes ignored until I point out that I need assistance (I only want to return their modem). Many people scurrying around trying to look busy but ignoring customers. Finally girl that waits on me gives me hard sell on their wonderful upgrades -- she does this a couple times -- this after I initially explained I was trying to *save* money not spend more. I hand them their modem IN PERSON. 8 months later, I am still being charged monthly modem fee. I had called "customer service" couple months ago -- guy was amateurish and reading from script -- "I can help you with that" multiple times. He also gives hard sell after I just told him I was trying to reduce my Comcast bill/services.
This is state-of -art clueless customer service.</text>< Gmap_id>

This service is so spotty one minute I am cruising and then on the next click My browser is spinning.. I have had it .. I am on the hunt for a new service provider.  Monopoly in this market but you still have competition and I will find it.. If anyone else has anything better to report I am all.  Ears.  I have called your customer service department more than 5 times since I have been here.. I have had guys come out and nothing fixes the problem.

The rep didn't have a smile on his face BUT he was fast and efficient. I didn't have to repeat myself and he got everything right, now that's a first! Most of the time, the customer reps have great smiles but you ended up wasting half an hour explaining yourself. Sorry I will take efficiency over the smile in this case. I was in and out in 10 minutes!< /text>

I had a great and fast experience there, and the person helping me was very friendly and helpful. I called to get internet setup at my place, and I had it up and running an hour later. Just drove to this store, picked up my modem, went home, plugged it and I was good to go. Fast and easy.< /Review>

Only had to wait about 6 min to get a customer rep.

A somewhat complex transaction: changing the name on an account and removing services.  Rico was very personable and got the job done.  yes, he had to type and type and type into his terminal, but it all got done quickly.<//Text>

Editing my review: The staff couldn't handle a simple matter of transferring the connection to one of roommates. I had to cancel account because of their inefficiency and now I'm being charged an early termination fee when I was explicitly told I wouldn't be charged a fee. Spent hours on the phone with customer care to resolve this matter but it's pretty pointless. Stay away from this store.</review><user_name>Avinash Herle< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

Went into the store today to return a modem that they weren't supposed to ship to us in the first place. The wait was an hour simply to take back our modem and give us a receipt. My overall experience with Comcast has been very poor. They constantly make mistakes, don't do what they say they're going to, and the Internet drops out for days at a time requiring a service technician to come out. They take very little responsibility for their own mistakes and leave it on the consumer to figure out what happened and solve the problems.< /Review>

<Review>Just returned from the Comcast store at 717 E El Camino Sunnyvale    at 5:20  09/13/2016

My husband (David) and I were the third in line, his name was third on the board. Several people came in after us. My husband name was called to station 7. We were there to exchange our remote. All of a sudden another person with the name of David comes up and says it was their turn. Their name was not on the board.  The girl at station  #7 Jenny (Latin) told us to step aside, that she would help after she helped the other David(also Latin). When she finished with them she TOLD us to go to another service person.

This was pretty disturbing to us. We did not know that Comcast service personnel were so RUDE

Isn't there some kind of training that the service people go throw ? If they do, there needs some refresher courses that should be provided.< /Review>< Pics>

I don't recommend this office at all!
Totally unqualified staff works here. I arrived to country and decided to connect to Xfinity because I had already opened Internet plan here. I came to this office and asked a smartphone line. They took my personal data and told that there's some issue. I got an ask to return in one week. After one week they tried one more time, but it was failed again. And after a few days I got a mail with message that there were hard inquiries! But nobody told me about it. Of course checks were failed because I had just arrived in country.
After a few month I opened two lines + I was approved to get two smartphones. I did it through web site.
Don't search of help or some info in this office!!!</text>

I had come to return my cable box and to cancel my service due to a move. They were very friendly when I arrived. I was quite shocked however when the service representative next to me started to talk badly about the customer they just serviced to the representative working with me. It felt unprofessional and left a bad taste in my mouth.</text>

We came to the store to solve the cable modem activation problem. No body came to us when we entered the store. We tried to ask for help from a staff at the counter and was given a phone number to call, which we already tried at home and didn't work. Finally we had to go to another Xfinity store to solve our problem.</review>< pics>

<text>If you're somehow able to get a real person on the phone, the probability is 50/50 that they can help you without transferring you three times.  What's more likely is that you spend 45 minutes trying to navigate through their useless automated phone system to find answers.  The service from this company is absolutely appalling and, if they didn't have monopolies in so many markets, they'd be out of business years ago.  It's very obvious that they're willing to cut any corner necessary as long as it helps their bottom line.<//text>< rating>

I needed to come here recently to replace a faulty DVR I was sent.  I was in and out with a functioning replacement in under 10 minutes.  While there were people waiting, there was a number of open stations so the queue was handled very efficiently, and we didn't even have to stand in line.  A tablet at the door had us enter our name and we could sit comfortably watching one of the many TVs while waiting just a few minutes to be called.  When I was called, the person I talked to was able to exchange the faulty DVR with very little questions asked and was professional the whole time.

Consider me impressed, and pleased.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Comcast sent me a digital adapter several years ago for FREE. Now suddenly it starts to charge me for $1.99 per month for that adapter! As a matter of fact, I have never used it because I do not have any analog TV at home, and I am using Dish Network as my TV provider, the reason I have comcast TV included in my account is simply because it is cheaper than just have Comcast Internet.  I requested for the adapter years ago simply because it was offered  for free at the time.
I called Comcast today and talked to two agents, they refused to drop such charge. When I asked to cancel my service, I was told I have to return the adapter in order to cancel my service!  What A Joke! A free digital adapter sent out to your customers years ago, now all of your customers have to pay for it and have to return it if cancel service? This is how Comcast does business! So be careful.</Text>

My review does not reflect the employees of Comcast, only the company and management that employs them. This service center always has a 30+ min wait. Always. The service center has little organization and their products (xfinity etc.) are poor. Comcast has a monopoly and they need competition. The market is ripe for another company to come in and provide better products and better service.< /review>

The service in this center has improved by miles compared to a few years ago.
I just visited this center 10 minutes ago around 1:10pm Thurs. and I got my old broken box replaced in less than 5 minutes. It is an enjoyable experience. What a difference they have made!  Thanks< /Review>

My first visit to any Comcast service center and it was way too easy.  In and out in less than 10 seconds! My issue was simple.  Needed a new remote to replace one that failed.  When I called the 800 number they offered to replace one for free; but there was the delay due to shipping time and a $10 shipping fee.  The rep. suggested I go to the service center and get a replacement immediately.  After reading the other reviews, I was prepared for a wait and poor service.  But what a pleasant surprise.  I visited at 9:30AM on a Tuesday and there was only one other person waiting.  But I did not even have to sign up.  The lady in front with the ipad asked what the problem was.  Took my broken remote and gave me a replacement on the spot from a bin she had next to her.  Based on this experience I have no complaints.<//Text>

<text>I don't know about this store but avoided it due to the horrible reviews. However the Westgate store was stellar, super modern, greeted immediately and treated professionally. It took less that 10 minutes and I was out the door with my receipt. Highly recommend this location.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>This is a review of Comcast generally and not of a particular service center.  I recently signed up for service with Comcast.  Was told that my bundle would cost me $140 per month.  When the bill came, it was for over $220.  When I called, the Comcast rep told me that the rep who set me up was only "estimating" and that my actual monthly fee would be approximately $162 per month.  There were a host of "one time" charges that brought me to over $220 and that no one previously told me about.  The rep could not explain all of these.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<text>I returned my modem early as I was moving away and I asked if I could continue to use xfinity wifi until the end of the month when I finally moved out if I kept my account active until then. I was told that wouldn't be a problem. Turns out that was a flat out lie and their system can't support that so I'm left paying for 2 more weeks of a service they can't provide.< /text>< pictures>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>Pretty horrible, I have to say. We were never able to make the TV work for years., though we pay
$ 10 every month with my basic internet service, which creeps up in price yearly.

Once a year I do care about TV, which is on OSCAR night. There is only 800- phone number connecting us to "Victoria" in the far away Philippines, who loved to hear herself talk instead of listening to what we needed.

After hours of trying to solve the problems ourselves, the images come in, but no sound. Again no help in sight.

As soon as there is another service on the horizon besides Comcast, I will switch. That is for sure.< /review>< GmapID>

I opened an account on site and asked the staff what information or number for activating the service. He told me just phone number. After I went back home and installed the equipment, and called the customer service, I was told that I had to provide an account number to activate. I said the staff did not give me that and how I could find out my acct., the customer service replied "check the bill"......I even did not activate it, he told me to drive back to ask the staff or wait a month for a bill??!! excuse me?! Such a ridiculous service. Suck staff at this site.</Review>

I can not believe the service is so bad although I saw lots of negative comments already. I use the internet from last month and pay regularly. But I receive an email today said my billing is overdue and there is more 120 dollars should be payed. I check a few times online and finally found I have two accounts on me, the same addresses and service packages. It is really unbelievable that the staff  in the store opened two accounts on me wrongly when I opened the service. They have disconnected the wrong account from me now. But I do not know whether it will effect my credit score. How can they be so stupid!< /review>

<Review>Afterward, I always feel like a stop over at Walgreens so I can waste another hour for a 30 second transaction.

Service at this place awful. Representative here are unfriendly and do not understand customer needs. They don't honor their own deals given to customer and change prices and give pathetic response saying only manager can rectify this and now we don't manager here today.<//review>

I think that every time I go here, I get more services, and a lower monthly bill. Friendly, professional staff. I think most people who hate Comcast must call in, because service when walking in has always been exceptional for me. I go to this specific location whenever I need anything Comcast related.< /text>

So terrible.

They have only 2-3 reps that help customers when the lines are 20-30+ people long.  I'm pretty sure the sloth is the spirit animal of 95% of the people that work there.  Reps checking their phones and texting instead of helping customers.

When they do help customers, they take an absurdly long time with each one.

If you're going, I would conservatively block off at least an hour window, probably more.</Review>

Was happy with the service when I had it.  But it got so expensive over the last 2 years.  The real ridiculously poor experience was in trying to cancel.  Went to the website where they state 'our agents are availabel 24/7' right next to their 1-800 phone number.  But when you call, it says agents are only available during normal business hours.  ????   Then I got a 'chat agent'.  They shared that only chat agents are available 24/7.  That's fine.  But don't put the 24/7 reference next to the phone number then!  Put it next to the chat button.  Now, when I asked to cancel my service, I was told that only Customer Support on the phones can cancel service, and I would need to call back during normal business hours.  Ok, so now I'd laugh if I wasn't getting so frustrated.  I am in back to back business meetings all day, so don't have time to call into customer service and wait on hold during the day.  I asked if I could request an agent to call me at a specified time.  The answer was no, that I would have to initiate the call myself.  The chat agent themselves were polite.  But I shared how unimpressed I was with their employer.  The 'support people' may be nice, but the policies put in place by Comcast are horrid.  Executive mgmt at Comcast, get it together!  Really?  24/7 next to your phone number, and then 'I'm sorry, but our office are closed...please call back during normal business hours'.  And then to not offer an email address or way to send a request to be called back.  Very, very, very poor process, policy and service.  You will lose many more customers, and lose the chance to get others if you continue this silly process.  Not so impressed I must say.<//text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>The workflow logic to register for internet baffles me beyond comprehension. I get it -- it's an oligopoly, so it could sort of do whatever it wants.

One of many examples: Since I have to order a self-install kit, it's shipped to my billing address, which is far away from where I actually need the internet serviced.

And then I call the customer service and its AI is so dumb. It can't recognize any voice commands. I tell the computer, "I need to update where the self-installation kit is shipped to." The AI responds, "Your balance is zero." Awesome.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<text>This store is pretty well organized, and the staffs are supportive and friendly. Make sure to choose this store to activate your service instead of the other one: 597 East Calaveras Boulevard, Milpitas, CA 95035, where I experienced a terrible customer service from one of their staffs (I remember his name was Carlos who surprisingly insulted his customer and charged extra fees and costs associated with unrequested services).<//text>< Pictures>

I've never seen such a badly organized operation.  They are terribly understaffed, and rival the DMV with their customer's dissatisfaction.   For your own sanity, never go on a weekend to return a box, change service or begin service.  You will wait, and wait, and wait.  One Saturday I waited for over an hour and a half and finally left after I figured I'd be waiting at least another hour.  Beware.< /Text>

They expect you to wait around for an hour+ to return a DVR and get a receipt.  The last time we just dropped one off at the "drop off center" after moving out of our old apartment they said it never got returned and we got sent to collections.  Calling their customer service team was a complete waste of effort.  This location is not staffed to handle the level of customer dissatisfaction generated by this unethical company. We've been burned twice by Comcast. We will never do business with Comcast again.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808fb675d8da9ec5:0xf59bb60cffd54f44<//GmapID></record>

<Text>Good customer service starts with good training of staff. So you can't blame the staff for their shortcomings all the time.

After noticing snail speeds on my network every evening (I assumed the culprit was an overloaded network in the evenings when all my neighbors are home and streaming along with TV services stretched to their limits).

As suggested by phone tech support, I went in to upgrade my modem (not router) as advised by tech support for slow speeds. When I was convinced by the manager to take a router and dumb it down to a modem (I should have followed my instincts), and tried activating the device as suggested, it didn't work. Turns out the router -m model doesn't play nice with Apple network (Airport devices).

So after three trips to the service center, and finally getting a modem-only device, it works as intended. And by WAI, I mean the speeds went from 5-10 Mbps to 210 Mbps, that's great!  Until...the evening came, and it all came down to 3 Mbps again. Not the modem's s fault, just an over-provisioned, over priced network.< /Text>< response>

I came back the next day to explain the situation and talked to Russ, a very confused guy. He could not understand what i was saying. Again, i had to wait a very long time since russ said "there's a line and you have to wait like everyone else" They did not acknowledge they made a mistake, did not apologize or try to remedy the situation in any way. Thank you comcast for wasting my time with your incompetence. For everyone reading this, go to the service center in san jose. They are speedy, and know what they are doing.

Not very customer friendly the staff in there and you'll end up having monosyllabic responses. Pathetic customer service with no willingness to go out of the way and help. Avoid at all cost and try and keep the interaction to bare minimum. All you'll hear about are the stuff's they can't do and that's a long, very long list.< /Review>

A complete nightmare! These guys did not setup my account right the first time, I signed up for the 105 Mbps package and the lady mistakenly put in the 50 Mbps package. When I went back to fix it the guy that helped me wanted to charge me more than what I had already agreed to pay for the 105 Mbps bundle, he had to get management approval to give me the rate I had already agreed on with the first person. To top that I got a broken modem, so I had to return it, then the new one I got had a bad cable, so once again I had to go to this place to get it replaced. To make matters even worse there has been 3 technician visits to my house to try to figure out what is broken in my connection, all guys basically fix what the previous did. I am pushed to to go back to ATT, another mediocre ISP.< /Text>

<review>A whole new level of customer no service, its not this branch's fualt, its comcast and the way the do business. You have to wait couple of hours to return your modem, and you cant cancel business internet via phone, u have to email and they dont reply, so they can ripp you off and suck you out of your money.<//review><rate>1<//rate>< Response>

I'm disgruntled with Comcast's service for a few months.
I went into this service center and asked for help as to why
I wasn't able to stay connected to the internet (internet is all I have with them).
I thought it was my old router so I brought it in.  They took it in.
I asked for what routers were okay to buy for use with comcast system
and they said anyone will do.  I bought one at Best Buy but it didn't work.
I had to return it.  I then went to Comcast website which lists just a couple
routers that work with their system.  They are outdated per Best Buy.
the new router worked fine for one day then same problem - I have to reset
the router to get internet again.
I have the 10 Mbps service.  It's not the least but it's all I need.  I had the
bundled package but went with separate service providers since it was cheaper.
I've liked having internet via cable until a couple of months ago.
Everytime I call in to request help to resolve my problem, I told that my account
is deficient and that I need to upgrade.  I hear a different price for upgrading each
time I call in and even the last time I went into this service center.
I bought my own new router because Comcast was going to charge me $10/month
for theirs.  Whereby I bought my own and got it within 2 days for $37 (w S&H)
I'm at my wits end with this company.  I'm not getting any respect.< /Text>

<Text>Absolutely horrible experience.  I came here because I have been having internet issues since July 18th so nearly a month.  I have had 3 technicians visit since that time and have called their customer service 8+ times and even made an FCC report and got in "contact" with their "Executive Customer Relations" Christina M.  She closed my FCC report even though I am still experiencing disconnection issues.  So I show up and was greeted by a very nice man in dreadlocks then told to wait till my name was called.  Their representative Gina called me and refused to hear anything I had to say only insisting that this "service center" only provided modems and nothing else then literally walked away from me.  Her manager had to come talk to me while he was assisting another customer because of how rude and ridiculous this Gina was.  He was able to make another technician appointment but never apologized for her rude behavior only saying he will talk to her.  I am considering moving from the area because the ISP selection in Mountain View is filled with liars and cheaters who can't even provide their service and treat their customers like garbage.</Text><Rate>1< /Rate>< Pictures>

<review>Comcast retail apparently thinks that it is okay to make people wait for 1/2 hour - 1 hour to change out equipment that we pay anywhere from $2-$10 a month for.  These are not complex problems.  You swap it out.  When I asked to a manager, ERIC told me that he was sorta the manager.   And then I told him I was disgusted that out of 9 stations, 2 were servicing people and he and his co-worker were laughing and talking in the front desk.  He said he just got to work and that he had things to do before helping people.  7 people walked into the store after me.  It was a sudden entrance of people.  I was #5.  You do the math.  Each person takes 10 minutes or so.  Worse than the DMV.  IN fact, I rather go to the DMV.  Here is some suggestions...typical queuing theory (many lines versus one line).

1.  Track what issues you have and how long each case takes.
2.  If there is an obvious issue that goes quick like simply swapping out equipment,  then create a separate line or even a window where all the equipment is available right there, on shelves ready to go.  Have people queue up in that line to get just new equipment.
3.  To decide the issue, ask questions upon the customer entering.  You already have the desk and a nifty tool to enter the name of the customer.  This seems to happen but inconsistently.
4.  Make sure there is more than two employees working.  You charge a lot, a lot of money for your service, you can hire people.  Your retail stores are large and you have 9, count them 9 stations in your Sunnyvale store.  The incremental cost of hiring an employee is at this point, just the employee.  It is not as if you need a bigger store.
5.  No laughing, no ignoring customers, no talking.  This is serious.  People have things to do, places to be.   Please don't insult us by talking and not taking the job seriously (ERIC)
6.  Study your stream of customers, understand peak and non-peak hours.  Make sure you are staffed for it correctly.
7.  I want to see a employees calling for help when they see the line gets too long.  Even Safeway or Trader Joe's does that.  Please visit the stores to see how this works.
8.  Cross train your employees so they can do multiple jobs so in the case of a burst of customers, someone can bring the line down.   In other words, Trader Joe's got this one down big time.  Anyone at their stores can ring up someone.  I will hand you that your system is more complicated than a grocery store but hire smarter people.

It really feels as Comcast does not understand customer service 101. You have a good service, you have apparently now good service call times with a small window.  Get the retail up to par.

You have a monopoly in our area.  All other service is subpar compared to yours.  I will admit that.  Laying down wires is not a cheap process so not too many new comers in this industry.  But I promise, the minute there is a new comer to our neighborhood with pretty good service, I will say good-bye to Comcast.  You do not have a loyal customer here.  Just one that needs your service.  Go Elon Musk.  Please start your next big adventure.  Google works too.   Is Comcast brave enough to change my mind?< /review><resp>None</resp><UserId.>105550953980584357896< /UserId.><pictures>None</pictures><gmap_id>0x808fb675d8da9ec5:0xf59bb60cffd54f44</gmap_id></record>

What a rude receptionist, i didnt get her name because she didn't even introduce herself(african-american woman).  Walked in, stated what i needed(cable box pick up) she said "I don't care! Name?!!" I said "Its under my girlfriend's name her name is...", was quickly interrupted by her,  " I said,I dont care, I just need your name!!??".  WTF...if you are not happy with your job then get another one, preferably not as a receptionist.   Good thing the woman who gave me the box was very pleasant and fast(service).<//review>

Terrible customer services in biling department. I order services, I got 18+dls for HBO which it was offered free for three month. plus I original placed order for 3 televisions the guy who conected the cable got one box, aparently the lady (comcast lady) who took my order had a hearing problem or was doing something else than talking to me, so end up re-schedule another apointment for the other boxes, the person I spoke with didn't mentioned to me I had to pay for the second connection, which it was  a mistake made by a comcast employee. I called ask them why should I have to pay for a mistake that it was made by them in the first place, the biling pernonnel was rude and said "any time there is a technician coming to your home you'll have to paid their labor bla, bla, bla" I got tired wanted to cancel the account but I don't want to have my kids without cartoons....I mean I'll be shopping around for better services, I truly dislike comcast personnel.< /Review>

I came in asked if I could drop off my box and leave. I was told that there were 7 people in front of me,and a 35 min wait. I said that ridiculouls just to drop off and leave. Ya I got smart with the little round name taker. And steped out. When I came back in to sign up to wait. She retaliated by going around me and checking in 3 more people before me. I had to had to ask her twice to sighn me up. And asked her if this is how things work here. She replied with oh so you deccided to sign in...powere trip much...when I got up to the counter I expaind what happen to the rep. admiting the I got a little smart with the name taker. I asked to see the manager. Of course he was unavailble. So I told him that all I ask to be adressed was professional fair attitude from that employee. He responded with well since your here to cancell your service you not a customer any more, and there's really nothing he could do.   Wow really I understand being on ther other end I worked customer service for 3 yrs. And even when emotions are high its still your job to be fair, and professional. If you can't handle that then you shouldn't  work in customer service!< /review>

The oasis in the desert that is Comcast customer service. Talking to agents face to face makes life so much easier than the horrendous, life-sucking experience that one has to go through if you have taken the truly unfortunate decision of calling them!!! God help you if you did.</Text>

<Rating>3</Rating><Text>Service is reliable, in my experience - more so than Earthlink DSL and old ATT Broadband was in 2005 when I switched to Comcast. In this particular branch, sometimes the staff is not knowledgeable, or high (last year I saw one staff member smoking something nasty and return to the desk babbling). Back to Comcast, price is a problem - they confuse the customer with long introductory rates. However unlike cellphone services, it's easy to downgrade without paying a Termination Fee. I switched to Comcast after too many failures with DSL. Comcast is not good for traveling - they have no alternative dialup numbers (Earthlink DSL does, even from Japan but not cheap).< /Text>< date>

It actually deserve 0! Disgust company! I was charged rental fee for modem after 8 months using their service! But the modem was I bought from Amazon! They asked me to provide the receipt otherwise they will charge me no matter where I bought it! Thanks to God! I bought it from Amazon! If not, I have no way to find the receipt! I fax it to them! They said they will waive the rental fee! But! Guest what! They continually charged me! I spent lots of time to deal with them! How dare they waste their users times so arbitrarily!<//review>

A lot can be said about how bad Comcast is at customer service. This office is an exception.< /Review>

Compared to the Xfinity location in San Jose the wait here is not long. I went during lunch when it was quite busy and I only waited about 15min. Compared to the SJ location where you would be waiting for an hour plus to been seen.< /Text>

Terrible experience - didn't tell us about the multiple requirements needed in order to properly switch our internet from AT&T to Comcast. If your home hasn't been serviced for quite some time with Comcast you might need a 'professional install' buyer beware and ask a lot of questions before making a final purchase from this location. Our rep's name was Eric and he chose not to tell us this. Wouldn't recommend using this store if possible.< /review>

My internet getting disconnected more and more frequently and when ever I talk to them they never solve the problem and they don't even tell where went wrong and other than that before they solve your problem they start trying to make you buy their other product they can spend 30min trying to make you buy but don't even help the problem at all.</Text>

Didn't inform me about hard inquiry - kept completely in dark. Later when I raised the issue - they said it cant be reversed. Extremely unprofessional behavior, bad bad service.< /text>

I was promised free upgrade for my service since I was a "valued customer" and after the upgrade, I was slap with $260 installation fee and $74 increase in my bill,
I hope that one day  somebody will do a  class action lawsuit, this company  deserves it<//Review>

<review>Just try finding an e-mail address to contact Xfinity, I dare you. Instead they give phantom charges and you have to spend 45 minutes on the phone to get things straight. I was hit with a bogus $99 phantom service call that never came for example. 1 hour of my time to fix it.<//review>< Rating>

An hour to return a modem that I bought from them when I started my service, but they insist is theirs. Also, charged cancelation fees they originally said I was exempt from. Never again.< /Review>
