<review>Crepes were tasty, my husband and I both got one and I got the gluten-free (rice flour) crepe, which is $2 extra. Seemed a bit too expensive, especially because it's a modest hole-in-the-wall place. They made the food fresh, there was about a 15 minute or so wait even though we were the only ones there. But then they brought us free spicy pickled veggies, homemade salsa, and a different bubble tea sample for each of us. The crepes were very large, too; it ended up being a lot of food! All in all that was a good experience, not sure if the spicy veggies are standard but other reviewers said they got tea samples, too. While we were there (around the time school gets out) probably at least a dozen teenagers came and at least half of them just hung out, so it got really crowded.
The bubble tea was advertised as $3.00/small & $3.50/large which seems cheap anyway if you did want to splurge for that.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOY29P44RcbEkzLcAxljIBTkL4j2ubfbuTrSeSC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPug3xsYvk9ZSuVnhQn29-97Ovznae5HDr4YWVw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

Lady was super friendly.  The food was very good and pretty fast.  I got the Mexican crepe with both horchata and a mango smoothie with OJ instead of milk and it was all very tasty. Will definitely go back next time.</text>

Delicious tasting gluten free crepes.
Almost everything about this tiny place is over the top. From the diabetes inducing amount of sugar and cream in the sweet crepes to the fake cheese in the savoury crepes to the free bubble tea samples the owner gives you and the ridiculous dance music that's always playing. Amazing!
The ingredients can be a bit plain sometimes, and it's not the healthiest meal, but still very tasty and filling!</Review>

<Review>Tiny hole in the wall with seating for three very small groups. The veggie crepe with cheese was delicious, particularly with their chipotle salsa which is served on the side. I'm very sensitive to spicy food, but a thin spread of the chipotle was perfect. They also sell cheap freshly juiced drinks. Quite the find.

Nice staff. Bad techno music, which was, at least, quiet.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Absolutely lovely place. They touch on so many pallets without destroying the quality-- for sweet tooths this is truly heaven. Boba tea, ice cream, bagels, smoothies, juices, crepes, and a couple sweet treats on the side. Affordable ranges for such a small hidden place-- ($4-15) in the mission. Not a lot of space to eat, but if you don't mind being a little cramped up with the sweet smells it's the perfect spot for snack/small meal. And the person who works there is polite about accommodating to diets. Haha and there is never ending techno(:< /Text>< pics>

Little Heaven Deli is a great place to start your weekend off right.

Don't let the hole in the wall storefront prevent you from checking it out - the friendly staff serve tasty, well-made drinks and breakfast foods for uninflated (relative to the rest of the Mission) costs.

Almost all the crepes - both savory and sweet - are delicious and made fresh in front of you as soon as you order, as are the drinks.</review>

Excellent customer service, delicious crepes and refreshing aguas frescas. Visiting tip- this place is small, tiny. Best described as a wide long hallway turned deli stand. Very limited seating however if you(+1) are in the mission district and want to pop in for a coffee and crepe this place is perfect. I cannot stress enough how accommodating the staff was, I enjoyed my crepe&drinks that were a good sized portion for a low good price. I'd come back for sure.< /review>

Excellent customer service, delicious crepes and refreshing aguas frescas. Visiting tip- this place is small, tiny. Best described as a wide long hallway turned deli stand. Very limited seating however if you(+1) are in the mission district and want to pop in for a coffee and crepe this place is perfect. I cannot stress enough how accommodating the staff was, I enjoyed my crepe&drinks that were a good sized portion for a low good price. I'd come back for sure.<//Review>

<review>Great variety and nice staff, with gluten free options. The sweet crepes can be crazy sweet though, so be prepared with a friend for sharing or a bitter drink to go with it.</review>< userid>

My basic Strawberry Banana and Nutella Crepes came out with lots of fruits & Nutella duhhh and good packaging if you have them to go. It was super cheap, the deli is right opposite to my apartment in SF and has excellent customer service. The cashier gave me some Jamaica juice with boba while I was waiting for my crepes. Cash only if under $10. Will come here everyday if I can..<//Text>

Hole in the wall joint with seedy Hollywood ambience and not-so-updated (or clean!) tables, nor is great seating arrangement.

Food is made fresh so that's a plus. It's priced reasonable for the area.

Water bottles, though, twice the price of a regular restaurant and up to ten times of what it may cost if you had bought at a local grocery store.</review>

One of my fav spots for quality Burgers. Service is excellent even when they are busy. Service is typically good. Ambience is similar to Fresno's scene.<//review>

Wide selection of options. It is a little overpriced but you would expect that with the location on Hollywood Boulevard. Staff was nice enough. There are no refills on drinks. Good options including gelato and other normal fried foods. Place was relatively clean and felt good to be out of the hot sun.<//Text>

Not the best one in LA. But if you want simple LA style döner, you have to taste it. Clean and tidy inside. Service is good<//Review>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>I went here in October 2017 and ended up incredibly sick the day after. I'm not sure if it was the food, or their disgusting bathroom, but within 24 hours I was vomiting non-stop, followed by all the usual fun stuff that comes with food poisoning. It ruined the last day of my holiday and made my 12 hour flight home pretty horrible, so I'd definitely recommend not eating here.<//Review><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

The worst doner I've eaten ever! The owner was not honest, the meat was old and I got sick because of it. He said also their food was halal, but I don't agree with him after he was saying their doner was really good and fresh. I don't recommend this place to eat, will definitely not go there again! Shame on you, bad publicity and advertisement of great Turkish Food!<//Text>

The woman at the reception had some personality issues!! The minute we got in,  she was looking at us angrily.  She replied like ' no we don't have it' for  any dish we asked! So we left the döner king place as a whole family! I don't recommend any decent human being with dignity to go in there! There are much better  places around!</Text>

If you are in Hollywood boulevard and looking for a quick bite, this place is a good option, especially if you are into Turkish style fast food. Clean and spacious place with good service. I have tried chicken döner and kababs. Loved the chicken döner but beef kabab was a little bit chewy. I also enjoyed the icecream I got as desert.< /text>

Isn't as good as a German Döner, but it was good for an american one. Looked pretty empty when we were there, but clean and freindly. So I can only recommend to try it out.</Text>

Horrible people running this place, I urge a good Human to never go to this place. The owner is a rude man and is a disrespect to humanity. I will not say what happened. But if you run a restaurant you should know a little about hospitality and customer service. If a person cannot even say hi with a happy face, his restaurant deserves to go in loss and close, I am truly dissapointed at this restaurants horrible customer service. His meat is haram as well all lies ......

Döner king? No real döners found here. They have mini durüms that they call "döner wraps", but no real döners. The portions weren't generous for the price paid. They cheap out. The photos used for their menu are stock photos that they didn't even pay for. You can tell by the watermarks right in the middle of the image. Don't waste your time here!<//text>

< Review>
Been here many times in the past. Decent service. Seemed like good work. Called a week in advance to make an appointment.  I was told to call the day before to schedule an appointment. Tried the day before, tried the day of. No answer and no call back after leaving a message. Went into the shop and was told appointments were at least a week out?? Seems like yet another business that has so much business they can't afford customer service anymore.< /Review>

Been taking my cars here for years. Higher pricing than other alignment shops, but if you want it done correctly for the first time, with high exacting standards, this place is it. I won't take my cars anywhere else.< /Text>

I been coming to Johnson's alignment for about three years now. The beautiful young lady that works behind the counter is always so friendly and pleasant. It's always a pleasure speaking to her. I'm embarrassed at the fact I don't remember her name given that I visit their shop so often. I do remember John the assistant manager. He is very knowledgeable about alignment and explains everything very thorough. There is also Steve the manager who seems like he is often times in a bad mood. I try to avoid speaking to him because he seems upset most times I'm there. As far as quality of service the shop is second to none. In my opinion the price is a little higher than the average but I guess you get what you pay for. Also they do alignments the old school way. They do not use electronic alignment. I wonder why but it does not matter anyways. Their service speed varies on whether you are sitting there waiting for your vehicle or not. If you wait it's on an average of an hour to complete both front and back alignment. I will return for more service from them.< /Text>

<user_name>Shane Neumann< /user_name><text>Had probably the best car experience at this place than any other shop I've ever been to. I recently did an overhaul on my suspension on my 330 m and needed to take it in for an alignment, which is the final step. I knew the car had been in an accident but discovered the damage was a little more extensive than I thought. John and his team went above and beyond in providing the best possible outcome despite the issue with my suspension. Communication was a perfect 10/10 and my car is driving straight and better than it ever has since I've purchased it. Would recommend this place over and over again and will be back for all of my future work.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c2b4e71512a679:0x137cfa2dd28d195f<//Gmap_id><UserId.>107722055400741719734< /UserId.>< rating>

<review>I have been on and off again customer since 1990's. I just picked up my car, 2011 BMW 328i and it drives perfect after 4 wheel alignment and wheel balancing. It took 2 hours, right on time. I am very happy with their performance!</review>< Pics>

<Review>It's always a good sign when the shop is clean and full of nice classic cars. Steve quoted me to replace my lower control arm bushings, steering rack bushings, install new rotors and do an alignment. All of which were much needed... 300k miles take a toll.

The number quoted was reasonable and the exact number I paid (no magically inflating numbers here). The job was done right, the first time.

I'm happy to have such a high caliber guy just down the road. I'll be using again surely.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Review>About a month and a half ago. I had my 1978 Corvette front and rear end worked on, besides alignment. Let me tell you what a great job that mechanic did. Rides like a dream across the RR tracks. I'm very pleased with Johnson's.
Great outfit!< /Review>< Pics>

Had an appointment with the owner to get the car aligned.  I drove two hours one way and paid top dollar to get an alignment from them as I was told they were worth it.  The owner that I had the appointment with left before I arrived for a funeral and never returned.  The owner's brother said he would take care of it.  When finished there the car was pulling to the left.  Realized by the time I got home that it was not the roadways that were making the car pull like that so I went to my local alignment shop that same day.  Acording to my local shop the car was not aligned to factory specs which was causing it to pull to the left.  I then had to pay the local shop to fix the problem.  I asked the owner for a refund as they did not align the car properly and he refused.  Definately not happy with the service that they performed, nor am I happy with the customer service that I received.</text>

I am impressed by the professionalism but very amazing personal relationships of this office. The doctor and the assistants were great. Very busy it seemed but still took their time. I was very content with Yolanda who when approaching me with a treatment and explaining in detail about all the insurance things. was very straight forward yet thorough AND gave me a great impression of her personality which didn’t seem like robotic like most offices when they talk about money. I made sure she wrote her name on my appointment card because I felt very well handed off with my next appointment and wanted to be sure she is noticed. Everything about this office was amazing. And again I state, the office has impressed very much.<//text>

<Review>The Bright Now! Dental on Curtner Ave has been my dentist option since April. the experience has been efficient. For one, they accept my insurance and do not require to have me pay any out of pocket expenses until they confirm with my insurance what my patient costs will be. They did not force a financing option on me unlike other dental offices I have been too that were supposedly within my network. Their billing manager is very clear about what to expect with the time and costs, so I appreciate that. I will say the claims take weeks to be finalized but fortunately I am still able to get the work I need to get done. The relationships with the actual medical professionals is ordinary, not too friendly or charismatic, they are there to get the job done and move on. The hygienist is who I have come in contact with most and I appreciate her work as she really has made this a smooth process for me. Initially I was nervous since I never grew up going to the dentist consistently, but I am happy to be here now. For reference, I have an HMO dental plan with Cigna.< /Review>< userid>

Music in the lobby is too LOUD & it is warm / hot in there.  Seemed a little disorganized-wanted me fill out forms, asked me if I was waiting for someone after i had been checked in.  Dentist was nice, explained everything. Took an hour & 45 minutes for an exam & cleaning<//review>

My experience with this office has been overall very good.  I had contacted them to arrange a dental cleaning. The dentist who performed my exam was quite professional and knowledgeable, and the hygienist did an excellent job. If I hadn’t had to make two separate appointments for the initial exam and the cleaning, and if I hadn’t had to wait almost a month between the two, this would have been a five star review. Overall, a well-run office with skilled staff, though<//Text>

I’m really disappointed..
Since the beginning they start charging me for something they didn’t do until I went to the office and explain them ..so they remove the charges from my account ..but wasn’t the worse.!

What really make me mad is when they said my treatment is been completed and I found out I have more cavities and a crown to do after I pointed I have a filing there is more cavities..
And thay said ..HO IS NOTHING WE CAN DO ..!
Unless we remove the wisdom teeth’s..

Way they don’t tell the truth since the beginning..!</text>

While The effort of Charlotte looks good on Yelp and Google review, it’s seems to be all for publicity. I have called the main line and left a formal complaint with no response in a week. I have also emailed Charlotte twice with no response.

I have serious safety concerns for minors attending this office. The office manager Yuliana who has only been there for a month or so has created her own rules and tries to make people believe it is county or company policy. Parents, do not let her fool you. There is no county policy stating you have to let your minor children go to appointments alone and wait in the car. There is also no company policy that states this either. I have called 3 other offices who informed me this was not a company policy and I would be allowed to accompany my children to their appointments. Yuliana asked that I leave my 5 year old daughter in the office alone while the dentist did her exam. After voicing my concerns and letting her know I was uncomfortable with this she then said I need to be considerate of staff with the rise in numbers. This is also coming from the person who checked us in, didn’t check the temperature of myself or daughter, only my 9 year old, wasn’t paying attention (her words not mine) and allowed me to go back with my older child and then ask me to leave my 5 year old alone with strangers. Where is the patient centered care?  Why are you asking to leave children alone that cannot consent to treatments or advocate for themselves? I have been coming here for 4 months and never had a problem being let in with my 9 year old once a month for the orthodontist. This was my 5 year olds first visit with them. According to office staff this is a regular occurrence that they have asked parent of children as young as 4 to leave the kids in the office alone and wait in the car. Completely unacceptable.

Update
I’m convinced Charlotte is an automated response because it is literally the same response verbatim on each negative review. There’s no individuality to the responses aside from changing the name.< /Review>

RUDE AND SO UNREASONABLE AND UNPERSONABLE. They don't let you step foot into the waiting room, and they are easily able to have at least 1 person in the waiting room despite covid restrictions (covid doesn't say no one enters, it specifies a number that can be there). Luckily these are concierge services that you DO NOT need. Find a better place!!< /Review>

I had my appointment with the orthodontist yesterday, and I was running late. I called the office and told them that I would be late for about 15 minutes or so. The lady on the phone told me that they would probably reschedule my appointment. But I went anyways. I was accommodated that day, and they didn't cancel my appointment. I was very happy about it. Also, the orthodontist at this clinic is very friendly and approachable. I have nothing but high praises for his services.</Review>

The first time I came here for a visit, I schedule my appointment 4 days before, the lady on the phone even asked me for all the personal details & insurance as well to validate. Then finally on the day my visit, they made me wait for 2 hours, to validate my insurance.
Second visit coz of my stupid insurance didn’t change my dental office location. Again made me wait outside for 25 mins and got in.

I’ll not recommend this place at all.</review><pics>None</pics></record>

I want to start by saying that is the best office i ever been too starting by the manager Miriam for going above and beyond to satisfy everyone, staff are great, i had a consultation with Dr. Cheney (orthodontist)and it went well he told me a needed to see general Dentist and Dr.Patel stepped in and took care of my cavities, also her assistant Stephanie was really caring and was asking me if i was okay, i really felt comfortable and in good hands.
After i got my braces done and Miriam (Manager) was checking on me, awesome service and staff, i will recommend this office to anyone, thank you for taking care of me Bright Now Dental San Jose.< /Review>

< Review>
I made an appointment as a new patient with the intention of having my teeth cleaned. I set aside 3 hours of my work day to allow ample time for my dental visit. I was not told beforehand that the appointment would only be for x-rays and that I'd need to come back for cleaning. They were 15 minutes late to take me for my x-rays and then had me wait afterwards to see if a hygienist was available for cleaning, which they were not.

I was presented with a receipt showing a $10 charge for the x-rays and what-would-be $60 charge for when I get the cleaning. I asked them why doesn't my insurance cover this, as my Aetna DMO plan covers 100% of preventative services. They told me the original cost without insurance is higher and this was the remaining cost. I paid the $10 and left.

Over a month and a half later I called my insurance, mainly wanting information on how it'll work to see a different dentist now that I've been here recently, and they confirmed I should not have been charged anything for x-rays or cleaning and that I also have no co-pay. Aetna also has no history of this appointment in their system. I called the dental office back and they're claiming the $10 charge is for COVID PPE and had no explanation for why I was told cleaning would be another $60. They said I'd need to pay another $10 for COVID PPE if I came back to have my teeth cleaned. Their posted online hours also don't match their availability.

I will be finding another dentist and checking the charges again with my insurance. Avoid.< /Review>

I've been getting my teeth cleaned and treated here for the past year. As per the usual, I have tried the best to keep my teeth clean on my own, but eventually have to have tartar buildup and stains removed - which they do a great job of here!

I had a crack in one of my upper left teeth, and the dentist was able to fix it efficiently in the most pain-free way possible. He also removed all of my stains from coffee and tea.

I've come back 3-4 times to clean up and finish my treatment, and the dental hygienist does a quick and efficient job of cleaning/polishing my teeth.

I plan to keep coming back after every six months to ensure my teeth are in tip-top shape.<//review>< Pictures>

Awesome service. Dr.Lou is very accurate and knowledgeable, I had couple crowns and couple fillings done recently- no complaints there. Reception staff is very friendly and helpful. They would always remind me of upcoming appointments and squeeze me in their busy schedule when I need  something urgent. Overall, an excellent place to make a bright smile 😃.< /review>

Just had my first appointment with Bright Now Dental. I had made a few calls to different dentists to see about getting an appointment within the next day. I was about to give up when I called Bright Now. They actually put me on hold to check the schedule  for cancellations  (which none of the 10 dental offices I tried before had done). Lucky for me, they had one the following morning. I arrived and they were ready for me. I didn't have to wait around between services and I was out in a very reasonable amount of time. The staff is very knowledgeable, friendly, accommodating and professional. They make you feel very comfortable while you are getting your service done. I would reccomend Bright Now to anyone looking for a dentist.</text>

<review>I love Bright Now Dental. Dr Borole is wonderful. She listens and keeps working to find answers to my problems and unique bite. I love that she focuses on prevention and moving forward to keep my teeth and gums healthy for many more years.  I would  continue to see her even if she wasn’t covered by my insurance. Two thumbs up and definitely 5 shining stars.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Le is the best dentist I have  ever knew.  He is so caring and treats patient heartedly and professionally.  I have implants and tissue wrap at his office.  It was amazing painless before and after the surgery.  I am very content with the new gum after the tissue wrap and looking forward to completing my implants in the next few month.  I will definitely recommend him to my family members  and friends.  I would love to give him 7 stars if possible.< /text>

<review>I came here on a Friday afternoon and amid the pandemic I’m glad there were only 3 other patients waiting. They mainly followed their new protocol which was good. I still feel safe just like before at this location. Everyone was cool, too bad they couldn’t really see my smile with the mask on but I do hope they felt my appreciation.< /review>< GmapID>

Last October was my first visit here. In my first visit I was told I needed at least 3 procedures done. I was nervous to begin with and the grand total was very high. Sitting in the chair and being told the break down, I was extremely over whelmed!! I wish I would have told them, I need some time to think about this first, instead of proceeding with the work immediately, that day. I spent about 6 hours in the chair and over all it was not a good day for me! Bottom line is this, don't let your nerves make the final decision for you! If the total cost of your visit is way higher than you anticipated, ask for financing options! Get to the dentist regularly to avoid Preventable BS down the road. If you need time to make decisions on your dental work, let them know. This will help you make better decisions and in the comfort of your own home and possibly be able to do some research.<//text>

I will admit, I was a little skeptical our first visit. I grew up in a day when your dentist was in some old building no where near a major shopping mall. I will be honest I kind of felt at first like I was at the Jiffy lube of dentistry. After taking my son for his second visit I felt a little more comfortable and most importantly, my son really liked the place. I had a concern about a charge that I spoke with someone up front about and she advised that I contact my insurance to clarify my coverage. After I got home and made that call, before the insurance company even called me back a manager at the Dental office called me to talk over with me about my concern. Needless to say, they where very helpful and accommodating. Thanks Bright Now Dental Staff.<//review>

I highly recommend .Great job to all the staff members thank you very much God bless you all .

Front Desk Staff is Unfriendly, VERY RIGID, bit of a attitude problem and rude at times. They behave in a way, our way or highway. You don't feel welcome when you work the reception desk staff. They don't even smile. I am better off dealing with a Robot or a chatbot who would probably have more flexibility. That human touch and empathy is missing. They come across more like borderline dictators. They are there just to tell you what all they can't do or how they can't accommodate. Infact their outsourced call center staff is much nicer to work with.

The Dentist and their assistant (for X-rays) are rather nicer and sweet to talk to and work with.<//Text>

Dr. Cheney is really kind and knowledgeable in his work. Every visit has always been accompanied by great information to increase my personal knowledge. He has been really patient with me. Thank you!!

The assistant are great as well! Seeing them makes the morning great because they actually make an effort to make you smile during the process.

Naomi, the office manager, has been really supportive through the process. During any unfortunate circumstances, she was willing to do her best to squeeze you in and accommodate to the patient's needs. She has been on top of her work and has been consistent doing so since she came on board.

This location has gone through some changes in employees but it has definitely changed for the better. I am truely thankful for them, they are the A team. High recommendations!!</Text><userid>108831439735717461733<//userid><time>1501778327148<//time>< gmap_id>

As I was traveling, I needed to have a minor procedure done and this was the only dental place that accepted me and did it without any hassle. I previously contacted many other dental places and most of them denied my request saying I have to go to original place where the work was done previously despite the fact that i have to travel back just for this minor procedure.
Apart from their passion to help patients, they are very courteous and friendly. I will definitely recommend this place.</text>

Waited for a lil over an hour she saw me for 5 min told me I had an abscess and in need of root canal she told her assistant to refer me to specialist it only took her 5 min to check me I was in so much pain she did not give me any medicine for pain or for the infection.  Seeing so much good reviews I am shocked. Maybe it's just that doctor not sure but I would not recommend</Review>

<Review>Great place the dentist Dr  Borole is the most attentive dentist she actually listens to your problems and take care of it the first time around. I have been in pain for over 2 years after seeing a dentist in evergreen she broke my tooth then proceeded to tell me she could not finish up because she cannot . Leaving me in pain for the past two years. I will definitely recommend this place to all.Dr Barole I thank you with all of my heart.

<Review>I am new to the area and needed to get established with a dentist. After some research,  I decided to schedule a visit with Dr. Borole. I was nervous about putting my care in the hands of someone I was not familiar with knowing it might not meet my expectations.  After a cleaning and a few procedures, I am completely satisfied with my care. Dr. Borole took time to explain my treatment plan to make sure I understood everything.Also, the first crown that was to be placed was not   aesthetically pleasing to me (just a bit dark at top from shadow of metal) so she suggested another material that would not shadow. I had to wait a couple of weeks for new one to be made, but it was worth the wait. I am so thankful that she wanted to make sure I was completely happy. Now I can smile without being self-conscious! Thank you Dr. Borole and staff! I look forward to my future dental needs being met by my new dentist.<//Review>< Time>

Dr. Aparna Borole thank you for giving me my smile back!
Dr.Borole is one of the best in dentistry and has a great team of staff. They are all top of the line professionals with superb workmanship and state of the art equipment. I have had poor teeth for about 8 years and she has transform all of my ugly teeth into a beautiful smile. I had no hope unless I spend a fortune, but the fees at bright now dental are very reasonable and affordable for all incomes, they will also work with you. Dr. Borole is very caring, compassionate and patient with a desire to make her patients happy with the results. If you need a dentist that would take good care of you, I suggest you go to Dr. Borole, you will be so glad you did. I do everyday... Thank you so much!
Your much grateful patient, M.C.<//review>

<Review>Dr Borole is horrible!!! Awful awful awful. I checked in at 5:05 after driving 45 min w a crying infant to the appointment. After xrays and exam (which there was little delay between), the dentist dr. Borole tells me about my teeth and then proceeds to chart. So I proceed to put my infant to sleep thinking I can do that while she talks to me. Then she tells me I have to come back for my cleaning - it's then I realize I'm not getting a cleaning today. She's totally unapologetic and leaves without really trying to make up for it and tells her hr person to deal w me (basically in front of me...rude). They were so unhelpful I could go on and on but this place is a bunch of bs. You can tell this dr is just there for the money.

- she tells me she couldn't do the cleaning because everything took longer bc my baby was crying. When I confronted her that my baby crying didn't stop them from completing any procedures she too kbher words back and quickly left the room (dr herself let my baby cry thri the exam even when I tried twice to get her).

Oh and was horrible. Dr Borole my husband is a physician and thus is not how you treat people. What goes around comes around.< /Review>< Pictures>

I am impressed by the professionalism but very amazing personal relationships of this office. The doctor and the assistants were great. Very busy it seemed but still took their time. I was very content with Yolanda who when approaching me with a treatment and explaining in detail about all the insurance things. was very straight forward yet thorough AND gave me a great impression of her personality which didn’t seem like robotic like most offices when they talk about money. I made sure she wrote her name on my appointment card because I felt very well handed off with my next appointment and wanted to be sure she is noticed. Everything about this office was amazing. And again I state, the office has impressed very much.<//Text>

The Bright Now! Dental on Curtner Ave has been my dentist option since April. the experience has been efficient. For one, they accept my insurance and do not require to have me pay any out of pocket expenses until they confirm with my insurance what my patient costs will be. They did not force a financing option on me unlike other dental offices I have been too that were supposedly within my network. Their billing manager is very clear about what to expect with the time and costs, so I appreciate that. I will say the claims take weeks to be finalized but fortunately I am still able to get the work I need to get done. The relationships with the actual medical professionals is ordinary, not too friendly or charismatic, they are there to get the job done and move on. The hygienist is who I have come in contact with most and I appreciate her work as she really has made this a smooth process for me. Initially I was nervous since I never grew up going to the dentist consistently, but I am happy to be here now. For reference, I have an HMO dental plan with Cigna.< /Text>

Music in the lobby is too LOUD & it is warm / hot in there.  Seemed a little disorganized-wanted me fill out forms, asked me if I was waiting for someone after i had been checked in.  Dentist was nice, explained everything. Took an hour & 45 minutes for an exam & cleaning</Review>

<text>My experience with this office has been overall very good.  I had contacted them to arrange a dental cleaning. The dentist who performed my exam was quite professional and knowledgeable, and the hygienist did an excellent job. If I hadn’t had to make two separate appointments for the initial exam and the cleaning, and if I hadn’t had to wait almost a month between the two, this would have been a five star review. Overall, a well-run office with skilled staff, though< /text><Date>1606841547456< /Date>< userid>

Since the beginning they start charging me for something they didn’t do until I went to the office and explain them ..so they remove the charges from my account ..but wasn’t the worse.!

What really make me mad is when they said my treatment is been completed and I found out I have more cavities and a crown to do after I pointed I have a filing there is more cavities..
And thay said ..HO IS NOTHING WE CAN DO ..!
Unless we remove the wisdom teeth’s..

<Date>1608188858976</Date><rating>1</rating><Text>While The effort of Charlotte looks good on Yelp and Google review, it’s seems to be all for publicity. I have called the main line and left a formal complaint with no response in a week. I have also emailed Charlotte twice with no response.

I have serious safety concerns for minors attending this office. The office manager Yuliana who has only been there for a month or so has created her own rules and tries to make people believe it is county or company policy. Parents, do not let her fool you. There is no county policy stating you have to let your minor children go to appointments alone and wait in the car. There is also no company policy that states this either. I have called 3 other offices who informed me this was not a company policy and I would be allowed to accompany my children to their appointments. Yuliana asked that I leave my 5 year old daughter in the office alone while the dentist did her exam. After voicing my concerns and letting her know I was uncomfortable with this she then said I need to be considerate of staff with the rise in numbers. This is also coming from the person who checked us in, didn’t check the temperature of myself or daughter, only my 9 year old, wasn’t paying attention (her words not mine) and allowed me to go back with my older child and then ask me to leave my 5 year old alone with strangers. Where is the patient centered care?  Why are you asking to leave children alone that cannot consent to treatments or advocate for themselves? I have been coming here for 4 months and never had a problem being let in with my 9 year old once a month for the orthodontist. This was my 5 year olds first visit with them. According to office staff this is a regular occurrence that they have asked parent of children as young as 4 to leave the kids in the office alone and wait in the car. Completely unacceptable.

Update
I’m convinced Charlotte is an automated response because it is literally the same response verbatim on each negative review. There’s no individuality to the responses aside from changing the name.< /Text>< pictures>

< Review>
I had my appointment with the orthodontist yesterday, and I was running late. I called the office and told them that I would be late for about 15 minutes or so. The lady on the phone told me that they would probably reschedule my appointment. But I went anyways. I was accommodated that day, and they didn't cancel my appointment. I was very happy about it. Also, the orthodontist at this clinic is very friendly and approachable. I have nothing but high praises for his services.<//Review>

Worst customer service & make you wait forever.
The first time I came here for a visit, I schedule my appointment 4 days before, the lady on the phone even asked me for all the personal details & insurance as well to validate. Then finally on the day my visit, they made me wait for 2 hours, to validate my insurance.
Second visit coz of my stupid insurance didn’t change my dental office location. Again made me wait outside for 25 mins and got in.

I’ll not recommend this place at all.</review>

<review>I want to start by saying that is the best office i ever been too starting by the manager Miriam for going above and beyond to satisfy everyone, staff are great, i had a consultation with Dr. Cheney (orthodontist)and it went well he told me a needed to see general Dentist and Dr.Patel stepped in and took care of my cavities, also her assistant Stephanie was really caring and was asking me if i was okay, i really felt comfortable and in good hands.
After i got my braces done and Miriam (Manager) was checking on me, awesome service and staff, i will recommend this office to anyone, thank you for taking care of me Bright Now Dental San Jose.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1583663532548, 'text': 'Thank you for the review Diegzlucero, you’ve really made us smile!'}<//response>< gmapID>

I made an appointment as a new patient with the intention of having my teeth cleaned. I set aside 3 hours of my work day to allow ample time for my dental visit. I was not told beforehand that the appointment would only be for x-rays and that I'd need to come back for cleaning. They were 15 minutes late to take me for my x-rays and then had me wait afterwards to see if a hygienist was available for cleaning, which they were not.

I was presented with a receipt showing a $10 charge for the x-rays and what-would-be $60 charge for when I get the cleaning. I asked them why doesn't my insurance cover this, as my Aetna DMO plan covers 100% of preventative services. They told me the original cost without insurance is higher and this was the remaining cost. I paid the $10 and left.

Over a month and a half later I called my insurance, mainly wanting information on how it'll work to see a different dentist now that I've been here recently, and they confirmed I should not have been charged anything for x-rays or cleaning and that I also have no co-pay. Aetna also has no history of this appointment in their system. I called the dental office back and they're claiming the $10 charge is for COVID PPE and had no explanation for why I was told cleaning would be another $60. They said I'd need to pay another $10 for COVID PPE if I came back to have my teeth cleaned. Their posted online hours also don't match their availability.

I will be finding another dentist and checking the charges again with my insurance. Avoid.</text>

<Review>Not sure why there are so many bad reviews for this place....

I've been getting my teeth cleaned and treated here for the past year. As per the usual, I have tried the best to keep my teeth clean on my own, but eventually have to have tartar buildup and stains removed - which they do a great job of here!

I had a crack in one of my upper left teeth, and the dentist was able to fix it efficiently in the most pain-free way possible. He also removed all of my stains from coffee and tea.

I've come back 3-4 times to clean up and finish my treatment, and the dental hygienist does a quick and efficient job of cleaning/polishing my teeth.

I plan to keep coming back after every six months to ensure my teeth are in tip-top shape.</Review>< response>

A family of 4 with varied needs, the facility is terrific, many modern equipment, good to see the plastic stickers replaced often, clean. The support desk staff are terrific, the assistants and hygienist amazing.  The dentists varied quite a bit however, mine was fantastic as I had major work and found the vendor they used was amazing. But I’m not feeling it for the children’s, appears my spouse’ experience was good with no major work.</Review>

Just had my first appointment with Bright Now Dental. I had made a few calls to different dentists to see about getting an appointment within the next day. I was about to give up when I called Bright Now. They actually put me on hold to check the schedule  for cancellations  (which none of the 10 dental offices I tried before had done). Lucky for me, they had one the following morning. I arrived and they were ready for me. I didn't have to wait around between services and I was out in a very reasonable amount of time. The staff is very knowledgeable, friendly, accommodating and professional. They make you feel very comfortable while you are getting your service done. I would reccomend Bright Now to anyone looking for a dentist.</Review>

Everyone was very nice and helpful. I had to make an emergency appointment to get my tooth extracted and they got me in within two hours. Upon arriving I was taken immediately. I let the dentist know of my low pain tolerance and she was very sensitive to the fact and did a great job. I don't say this a lot about a visit to the dentist but this one was a pleasant experience.</Review>

Dr. Le is the best dentist I have  ever knew.  He is so caring and treats patient heartedly and professionally.  I have implants and tissue wrap at his office.  It was amazing painless before and after the surgery.  I am very content with the new gum after the tissue wrap and looking forward to completing my implants in the next few month.  I will definitely recommend him to my family members  and friends.  I would love to give him 7 stars if possible.< /Text>

I came here on a Friday afternoon and amid the pandemic I’m glad there were only 3 other patients waiting. They mainly followed their new protocol which was good. I still feel safe just like before at this location. Everyone was cool, too bad they couldn’t really see my smile with the mask on but I do hope they felt my appreciation.<//review>

<text>Last October was my first visit here. In my first visit I was told I needed at least 3 procedures done. I was nervous to begin with and the grand total was very high. Sitting in the chair and being told the break down, I was extremely over whelmed!! I wish I would have told them, I need some time to think about this first, instead of proceeding with the work immediately, that day. I spent about 6 hours in the chair and over all it was not a good day for me! Bottom line is this, don't let your nerves make the final decision for you! If the total cost of your visit is way higher than you anticipated, ask for financing options! Get to the dentist regularly to avoid Preventable BS down the road. If you need time to make decisions on your dental work, let them know. This will help you make better decisions and in the comfort of your own home and possibly be able to do some research.</text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<Review>I will admit, I was a little skeptical our first visit. I grew up in a day when your dentist was in some old building no where near a major shopping mall. I will be honest I kind of felt at first like I was at the Jiffy lube of dentistry. After taking my son for his second visit I felt a little more comfortable and most importantly, my son really liked the place. I had a concern about a charge that I spoke with someone up front about and she advised that I contact my insurance to clarify my coverage. After I got home and made that call, before the insurance company even called me back a manager at the Dental office called me to talk over with me about my concern. Needless to say, they where very helpful and accommodating. Thanks Bright Now Dental Staff.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x808e331af443908d:0x58d4feeaff5c941e< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Front Desk Staff is Unfriendly, VERY RIGID, bit of a attitude problem and rude at times. They behave in a way, our way or highway. You don't feel welcome when you work the reception desk staff. They don't even smile. I am better off dealing with a Robot or a chatbot who would probably have more flexibility. That human touch and empathy is missing. They come across more like borderline dictators. They are there just to tell you what all they can't do or how they can't accommodate. Infact their outsourced call center staff is much nicer to work with.

The Dentist and their assistant (for X-rays) are rather nicer and sweet to talk to and work with.< /review>< pictures>

I have been a patient for over 4 years, since early 2013, close to when they opened. I can not thank Dr Cheney and team enough for their help and support throughout my entire orthodontic process

Dr. Cheney is really kind and knowledgeable in his work. Every visit has always been accompanied by great information to increase my personal knowledge. He has been really patient with me. Thank you!!

The assistant are great as well! Seeing them makes the morning great because they actually make an effort to make you smile during the process.

Naomi, the office manager, has been really supportive through the process. During any unfortunate circumstances, she was willing to do her best to squeeze you in and accommodate to the patient's needs. She has been on top of her work and has been consistent doing so since she came on board.

This location has gone through some changes in employees but it has definitely changed for the better. I am truely thankful for them, they are the A team. High recommendations!!</Text>

As I was traveling, I needed to have a minor procedure done and this was the only dental place that accepted me and did it without any hassle. I previously contacted many other dental places and most of them denied my request saying I have to go to original place where the work was done previously despite the fact that i have to travel back just for this minor procedure.
Apart from their passion to help patients, they are very courteous and friendly. I will definitely recommend this place.< /text>

<Review>Great place the dentist Dr  Borole is the most attentive dentist she actually listens to your problems and take care of it the first time around. I have been in pain for over 2 years after seeing a dentist in evergreen she broke my tooth then proceeded to tell me she could not finish up because she cannot . Leaving me in pain for the past two years. I will definitely recommend this place to all.Dr Barole I thank you with all of my heart.

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I am new to the area and needed to get established with a dentist. After some research,  I decided to schedule a visit with Dr. Borole. I was nervous about putting my care in the hands of someone I was not familiar with knowing it might not meet my expectations.  After a cleaning and a few procedures, I am completely satisfied with my care. Dr. Borole took time to explain my treatment plan to make sure I understood everything.Also, the first crown that was to be placed was not   aesthetically pleasing to me (just a bit dark at top from shadow of metal) so she suggested another material that would not shadow. I had to wait a couple of weeks for new one to be made, but it was worth the wait. I am so thankful that she wanted to make sure I was completely happy. Now I can smile without being self-conscious! Thank you Dr. Borole and staff! I look forward to my future dental needs being met by my new dentist.</Text>< Pictures>

Dr.Borole is one of the best in dentistry and has a great team of staff. They are all top of the line professionals with superb workmanship and state of the art equipment. I have had poor teeth for about 8 years and she has transform all of my ugly teeth into a beautiful smile. I had no hope unless I spend a fortune, but the fees at bright now dental are very reasonable and affordable for all incomes, they will also work with you. Dr. Borole is very caring, compassionate and patient with a desire to make her patients happy with the results. If you need a dentist that would take good care of you, I suggest you go to Dr. Borole, you will be so glad you did. I do everyday... Thank you so much!
Your much grateful patient, M.C.</text>< pics>

Dr Borole is horrible!!! Awful awful awful. I checked in at 5:05 after driving 45 min w a crying infant to the appointment. After xrays and exam (which there was little delay between), the dentist dr. Borole tells me about my teeth and then proceeds to chart. So I proceed to put my infant to sleep thinking I can do that while she talks to me. Then she tells me I have to come back for my cleaning - it's then I realize I'm not getting a cleaning today. She's totally unapologetic and leaves without really trying to make up for it and tells her hr person to deal w me (basically in front of me...rude). They were so unhelpful I could go on and on but this place is a bunch of bs. You can tell this dr is just there for the money.

- she tells me she couldn't do the cleaning because everything took longer bc my baby was crying. When I confronted her that my baby crying didn't stop them from completing any procedures she too kbher words back and quickly left the room (dr herself let my baby cry thri the exam even when I tried twice to get her).

Oh and was horrible. Dr Borole my husband is a physician and thus is not how you treat people. What goes around comes around.< /text>

Amazing food and service. Awesome date place as there is a cool bar tucked away in the back if things are going well. They really know their sake. It was great to not just see a menu of sake and take a stab at something. This is a staple for me.</Text>

< review>
I claim to be no expert on anything but I've enjoyed sushi in different coastal establishments as well as some of the highest reviewed places in and around San Diego.  Ebisu is without a doubt my favorite.  Consistently wonderful every time.  Delicious, original creations as well as favorite standards.   The close attention to detail especially temperature are highlights.  You can't go wrong with anything here.  Delicious items for a non-fish eater as well such as grilled fare and wonderful veggie rolls.  Very friendly environment and staff.  Great for a romantic date night or a group looking for a fun time.  Try the stylish weekend-open lounge in the back which boasts a stocked bar with some excellent Japanese whiskies, thoughtful beer variety, many sakes, and other unique selections.  Ebisu is truly some of the best dining in San Diego.< /review>

<Review>This is one of my go-to sushi spots. It's not the cheapest sushi in Hillcrest, but like everything else in life, you get what you pay for, and  Ebisu is more than worth a little more $$$.
My last visit, they even graciously accommodated my friend's gluten allergy. There was only one roll we asked for that they couldn't make gluten free.
If you're drinking,I highly recommend the Saketini! It's a mix of sake, mojito, and martini.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

< Review>
I was kinda expecting more from such a high rated restaurant but everything was pretty average. Quick seating, fast service. I got the karma roll and the fiesty jack because they were the most popular items. I felt like the fiesty roll was extremely salty and the karma roll was too hot/spicy and couldn’t taste the other ingredients. Nothing special...<//Review>

An Intimate Dining Experience

The dining area was dimly lit in this Sushi Bar. My friend fell in love with the accents to the decor. We ordered cold Sweet Saki (can't remember the name). I went with the Fiesty Jack because it was topped with lava salt and chili and the Half Baked because I've never had asparagus in my sushi. I have to say that both Specialty Rolls were delicious. You can't go wrong on a Tuesday night stopping by before going home.<//review>

The sushi here is done in a more traditional style than some other places I've been. The fish is very fresh! The aesthetic is modern and the waitstaff friendly. I would recommend.< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Great experience. Came with a group of 6 friends late on Sunday night. Server was very friendly and attentive. We ordered a wide variety of food and enjoyed all the sake, sushi, and poke. Everything was a hit. It was my cousin's birthday and his first time trying Japanese food in general but Rave was super informative and helpful as he picked through menu items then brought out a banana tempora and coconut ice cream plate at the end. Moderately priced with a modern Japanese ambiance, I would absolutely recommend this spot for anyone looking for fresh, high quality Japanese food in the Hillcrest/North Park area in San Diego.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

My guy is a sushi snob, whereas I was raised vegetarian and can't stand the smell of fish. We are both happy here. He gets fresh tasty treats and I get the Simone Vegetarian roll, which makes me wanna go back for more.</review>

<review>The sushi bar was nice looking but it was almost closing time so the staff was less than impressed when I walked in. I got a cold shoulder and 'just esit' service but what was really unpleasant was the sushi. it was bland, boring and ininspired and I can't imagine myself ever going back there again.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Excellent sushi restaurant! Edamame and garlic edamame were very tasty, had the BSD roll which was a bit ambitious but delicious. Tried a couple bits of the other rolls my friends got and they were equally delicious. Did not have desert but the rest of my group did and it all looked amazing. Would definitely recommend and come back.<//Text>

Great atmosphere. Not a place to go if you like traditional Japan style setting. But the staff was wonderful and prompt. The plum wine was very tasty, and it was provably some of the best miso soup I've ever had. 5 stars. The only thing I'd recommend to the chef is adding that tiny little bit of wasabi to the nigiri, like you would find traditionally with nigiri.</Review>

<Text>Came here based on reviews and wanted to try a different sushi place than our usual.

Waitress was courteous and friendly but she was so soft spoken we could barely hear what she was saying to us.  The place wasn't noisy and I don't have a hearing problem so seriously please speak up next time.

Menu was interesting.  A lot of stuff we haven't seen at other sushi places.  We ordered the Tuna & Eggs, Blood Orange Hamachi Sashimi, "Pink Phloyd", and one more roll but I can't remember for the life of me.  Anyway, though everything sounded amazing it was mediocre by taste.  The "Pink Phloyd" is supposedly shiitake mushrooms, curry spicy tuna, with dried bonito, dashi sauce but all I tasted was chicken bouillon?!  The Tuna & Eggs was the dish I was most excited for but the quail egg was just on the side not on top of the sashimi like I thought it was.  I don't know it didn't seem creative at that point. Everything else was just okay.

Overall, pretty disappointment.  I like creativity but if the fish gets lost in all the crazy things added to it then...what's the point?  Anyway, food was alright but I think we're going to stick to our usual sushi places.<//Text>< Rating>

Boy do I feel like a brand noobian. I've been here 2-3 times over the years and never even knew they had a back room lounge/bar. WTF. How is that not in the highlights or tips and almost 500 reviews. Epic fail fellow yelpers, let me fix this. I've got an enormous bladder so never have to go to the bathroom and thus by reason for not going down the hallway and checking it out. I've also never been here latenight, so that's my fault.

Most of the other reviews will tell you of their great Happy Hour and garlic edamame which are both excellent and worth a try, but you should get bonito flakes on those garlic edamame's for some texture and too many aren't giving you the whole story here. Apps are pretty standard otherwise. Oysters are good, but pricey, even by the half dozen, plated a little too fancy as well. They really love their house salad because it's their base to other salads. The dressings are quite good, sesame-soy/lemon ginger is the highlight. Salmon skin is crispy and if you want more substance I prefer the tako to the tuna because the octopus to me takes on the marinade more than the tuna. I'm more used to the traditional Hawaiian style anyhow.

The garlic sauce for the soft shell crab is excellent and not bad on price, actually all the ponzu flavors as well are great for anything coming out of the kitchen. On the opposite end of the spectrum the supremely flavorful tuna collar dinner is to me almost not worth it. The collar is the rare instance where the most flavorful part of the fish is the cheapest and far too often discarded so the price point on this literally seems fishy, sure the yellowtail is extra thick and meaty, but when your amberjack fried and thinner grilled version are half, I have to question that. It's excellent if you don't mind the price. Thick, bursting with flavor and fat and with classic rice and salad it's a perfect meal. Jalapeno Hamachi sashimi is an interesting concept, but I think could be achieved differently and didn't wow me. Ankimo was well priced and often the base by which many traditional Japanese critics compare sushi restaurants. Liked how it was paired with wakame salad. Delicate and something I always suggest to people along with uni. Tempura Shrimp isn't a bad deal as they are large shrimp.

Omakase isn't quite what you're thinking. You only get it with the sashimi option versus the whole menu and to me they under value the option as a whole. The unagi is broiled, but thick and meaty, I was hoping for the smokey flavor from BBQ. Maki is very traditional and the standard nigiri line up with some extras like red snapper (ask for thinly sliced with a touch of lemon) mirugai, both rare even around SD. The specialty rolls are also not as adventurous as other places going overboard on ingredients and profiles, this is a good thing. The ponzu options make their sashimi menu very enticing.

Staff is very friendly as are the chef's, hours are great, especially Happy Hour. I've found people come here to drink more than eat in what is apparently the main room.

Ok so the back. Lounge holding 50 people with 2 booths and maybe 3 tables and the bar. Love the booth for the DJ and live bands that play. The key here is to try their extensive Japanese Whiskey collection, probably the biggest in SD, certainly more than the newer and supposedly Japanese menu influenced Bang Bang. They have more than just Hibiki here and the prices for drinks are very reasonable.  Service can be slow here because there is usually 1 bartender. Don't be like me and check this place out for all it's worth with great food and drink. It to me lacks in décor and the bathrooms seem insufficient for the capacity and I was hoping for more izakaya options. Not a single don bowl,</text>

I came in for a new pair of shoes and inserts. The customer service was great! I didn't realize that you could try on inserts, but the young man that helped me brought out a couple of inserts to try and cut the ones I choose down for me. Very friendly, very helpful.<//review>

<Text>The service was really excellent.  He is knowledgeable and very helpful.  The shoe that I was looking for was not available and he immediately recommended a similar shoe and it totally makes sense.  It works!  He is also very patient and help me to find running group since my husband and I just recently moved here in OC.< /Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Every time I’ve been into the store, I encounter the most helpful and energetic staff. They are knowledgeable (they actually run/workout) and  have great quality products.  I love supporting a a local business and will support them for years to come.</Review>

<review>Everything was well planned out from the fitting equipment to the techs (Brody) knowledge and recommendations. I like the fact that he listened to what I wanted and also looked at all of the data to come up with a shoe that was suited for my needs. I couldn't ask for anything more! This is the 2nd time I've been to this location and they've killed it each time!< /review>< Pics>

<Review>I can't emphasize how important it is to shop in-person to get your running shoes! Proper fit, type, and comfort are so important. Sometimes that means trying on lots of different shoes! I have been so impressed by the staff at Fleet Feet! They are so knowledgeable and friendly, I always look forward to my visits there!< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Super knowledgable staff.  And patient! After getting my oddly sized feed scanned (very cool!), I tried on at least 8-9 pairs of trail shoes.  I'm very picky and have been wearing the same model for years.  This was my first time trying something different and I could tell they understood this.   Carrie and her staff are very good at what they do.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>The people who work in the store are friendly and informative. I brought my 14 year old grandson in to get new insoles for his soccer shoes. The college student gal who helped us measured his feet, let him try various insoles, and cut the insoles that we were buying to fit perfectly. I also wanted to buy my grandson some running shoes for everyday wear and special runs his high school soccer team requires. He was reluctant to my suggestion. Again, our helpful sales gal stepped into the conversation and we ended up with a great pair of running shoes. It was a positive experience for me and my grandson. We left the store happy!!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>I just started running, but it was becoming obvious I needed to invest in some decent running shoes. I went to Fleet Feet because it was close, unsure of what to expect. From the moment I walked in, I worked with a representative who measured my feet and observed my gait. The results were reviewed with me and I was presented with shoes that fit my needs. I was able to take the shoes for a quick spin to see how they fit and felt. Being a beginner, it was explained what I should be looking for. I left the store with a great pair of shoes and couldn't be happier with the experience! I will be back for the next pair!</review>< Pictures>

I was having issues with blisters after increasing the number of miles I run each week.  I was looking for a new pair of running shoes that would allow me to increase my mileage without messing up my feet.  The staff at Fleet Feet was friendly and knowledgeable and they helped me find shoes that were properly fitted for my feet.   I will definitely return when I am ready for my next pair.<//Review>

Went to explore the fun run and it was my first time in the store (about three months ago). Since then, I have joined the Marathon Training group and ran numerous Half Marathon’s with the LA Marathon coming up. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and nice. All the people involved in the training groups are awesome! Highly recommend both the shop and exploring the training opportunities</review>

I love your shoe line, you have amazing selections and wonderful styles. I love love love my experience the other day which was completely by accident. The tech that you use in store is super impressive, the fact that you send that data via email was really cool, I am appreciative. The staff members are on point and so helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. I also enjoy seeing employees learning on the fly and getting trained in the moment. Did I mention that I also recycled my old shoes!! Outstanding. I had an interesting case a few days ago, I bought two new pairs of shoes. I asked at the check out counter may I combine my accounts from the Chicago location to Dana Point? The answer was no, since it's a state to state policy. I was ok with that but still I wondered what my status was at the Chicago location. Thus, I called the national sales line and after the first ring a person picked up, long story shot it was Joey, the CEO, I was so delighted by this phone call conversation. He asked for my address and is sending me something in the mail since his computer system doesn't give him information that I wanted. Really it was out of the sweetness of his heart! The fact that Joey sent his call center home early for holiday is so cool and makes Fleet Feet my new favorite company. I will never forget this and will continue tell the story for the rest of my life!

Thank you to the Dana Point Fleet Feet Team!
Thank you Joey.

I started working out at Orangetheory and for the past month since i started, I have had knee pain.  I called Orangetheory about me knee pain and they recommended me to this store.  The service was great and the attention to details made a difference when it came to selecting the right running shoe.  The gentleman helping me recommended a pair of New Balance shoes and I have to say I have no more knee pain!!!! Yay!!!!!  I will definitely be going back!<//review>

<text>I don't like Greek/Mediterranean food, but I love this food. The flavor is amazing. The meat is always good. The portions are huge, leaving me with dinner one day and lunch the next. This is easily one of the best local restaurants in Dixon.< /text>< pictures>

<text>Had to pick up some fencing at Tractor Supply and stopped by S&S Deli for lunch. *Unbelievable*. Food was delicious and ample! Every bite was fantastic. Service provided was very accommodating. Asked for a plate without carbs and got a two pound salad covered with shawarma and gyro. Took half home. Really, unexpectedly great. Batool the woman behind the counter was awesome! S&S is right off the highway and will be my new go to in Dixon! Ding!</text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808525f28ee0056d:0xc6643d0954fc4ca8<//gmap_id></record>

< Review>
I must say I was a bit unsure about this place because I couldn't figure out how could they have a perfect rating. Truth be told, they earned every single star.

I've gone to this place 3 times now and every time it's delicious. My friends and my husband have ordered different things off the menu and it's all been good.  I seem to always get the lamb gyro. It's loaded with tender lamb,  fresh veggies and a soft pita.  I'm a picky pasta salad eater and their's is the best!

The owners and staff are very professional and always curious. The restaurant and bathroom were immaculate.

If you haven't tried this place,  please do. You won't regret it.<//Review>

Well the interior is not what you see on the pictures, it's more like subway's. But the food is great. Worth it to stop by.... 👍</Review>

The food was really good and fresh tasting. They were kind and attentive as soon as we walked in. Very clean looking with a nice seating area and TVs. Clean restrooms. Lots of healthy food choices, plus they had Sobe lifewater with zero calories, yay! Another plus is that they offer military discount. We plan on coming back soon!<//Review>

The menu is affordable even when the quality and presentation of the food is on par with larger, more well-appointed restaurants.  Can't wait to go back for dinner tonight!<//text>< date>

Amazing Mediterranean food, something outside of the box for Dixon, usually have to drive to Sacramento or The bay for food like this. You must try a shawarma wrap, chicken or beef don't matter both are amazing! I get mine with their Chile sauce and ranch lol restaurant is always well kept, wait time for your food is like 10 maybe 15 minutes max. Always on point about their dishes. Guaranteed you'll come back. Eddy and Batool are the managers and who you'll see cooking Your delicious food!< /Text>

This place is outstanding in every way, a true hidden gem. Went here for a late lunch and only had a card to pay with, despite being cash only they served me anyways and nothing but gracious and friendly. Besides that, they served me what may have been the best pastrami sandwich I've ever had. I only wish I could give more stars, but I will absolutely be returning many more times to give more of my business.< /Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Amazing sandwiches!!! My personal favorite is the pastrami and my wife loves the roast beef. Very generous meat to veggies/bread ratio😋. This is the proverbial "hole-in-the-wall" spot that everyone should know about. Staff is very friendly and the place looks clean. Definitely going to be a longtime customer. Tip for 1st timers: take cash, as this place currently doesn't accept cards.....yet.<//Text>< GmapID>

I've been seeing this deli on the route that I drive at work some days It was really craving a sandwich so I decided to stop here and just check it out and see if it was any good. What a great decision I ordered the Italian submarine it is so big I can barely fit it in my mouth Delicious and will definitely recommend and would come here again. The staff is wonderful and friendly. Great job Beyer deli.</review>

Tried this place for the first time today and will definitely be back. I ordered a gyro and turkey sandwich, both were delicious and well priced. The staff was warm, friendly, and you could tell they cared about their business and customers. Give them a try!<//Text>

Once I walked in I noticed how clean and sanitary this place is, also their food is very tasty. It is a small sandwich, soup and dessert shop with big flavors. I order a vegetarian sandwich and a chocolate chip cookie shake and it was very satisfying and tasty. To my surprise it was very busy and I had to wait like 15 minutes to be served but it was worth the wait. The people managing this place are doing a great job and for that they get 5 stars from me. Thanks for the food and the great service.< /review>

Excellent sandwiches! The owner greeted most people by name and knew what they they usually ordered. This was so much better than going to Subway!</text>

One of the best Roast beef sandwiches I've ever had! If you are any where close to this deli it's a must try! Also the customer service is fantastic! Thank you Beyer's for the delicious lunch and service!< /Review>

<review>This is a true definition of a mom and pop shop.  Not only is the food delicious, but they're very friendly and they take time to get to know their regular customers.  This place is well worth it. Take a look at my BP Special picture.  They stack their sandwiches.  Another bonus, they're L.E. friendly.  Be advised, this place is cash only.< /review>< pictures>

This deli is hidden behind a business Plaza.  The owner is nice and the food is great.  I ordered half pastrami combo with chips and drinks for about $7.  The pastrami is very delicious.  My friend got the chili and by he said that it is absolutely amazing.  The place is fairly clean, the restroom needs some maintenance.  Overall, definitely recommend if you are ever down in South San Diego.</review>

Beyer Deli is open for business. These are the best sandwiches in the south bay. Try the Hot & Delicious or the Man Handler 👍. Help support this deli. They are good hard working people.< /text>

Great Sandwiches! Great customer service... This place is great. You can't go wrong with any choice you make here. Extremely busy around lunch time so call your order ahead of time if you're rushed for time. The owners and staff know about customer service and local businesses should use Beyer Deli and adopt their method of customer service. They treat you like they know you and welcome everyone. Oh and buy the way the sandwiches are great!!! FYI: CASH only.<//text>

Was surprised to read "cash only" as I approached the door.

Excellent service (quick and sincere apology when I wasn't noticed waiting to order) with a warm and friendly attitude. All public and visible work areas were very clean.

The amount of meat on my sandwich was generous. The quality (i.e., flavor) of the corned beef and pastrami was just "grocery store" deli average. When you took a bite, there was no separate corned beef or pastrami taste or texture. It was all a slightly bland (missing the smoked note and complex spices) pastrami taste. It's important to note there was NO off or bad favor—a nice pickled meat sandwich. Perhaps steam heat the corned beef and grill heat the pastrami might do the trick? Not sure.

All in all, better quality than most San Diego delis and a much better service experience.<//Review>

WOW d*mn good sandwiches... I got the New Yorker, Reuben, and California Double Decker and all of them were delicious. The Reuben was probably my favorite. The sandwiches are all under $10 too which makes them even better. Parking was a bit of an issue when I came around noon though so you might have to walk a bit. Worth it! I’ll be back for sure.</review>

There's a very good reason why this deli has more 5-star ratings than any other restaurant in South San Diego... the question is, why do they only accept cash - and what's up with the extreme fetish for law enforcement?

Cash + Law Enforcement = ?????</Review>

It was delicious!The sandwich is big also so bring your appetite.All the components were very fresh.The customer solution was comparable to it gets! It's a household the runs has and also runs this place.Mother and Papa and teenage youngsters. Extremely friendly as well as courteous!! This is my new go to position for a sandwich. If I can give this place 6 celebrities I would!It doesn't get any type of better. So grateful my good friend turned me on to this place. Oh yes! It's very clean inside as well.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80d94eb2f14d9c47:0x6fb78034ea7a13f6<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The best hands down deli in the south. When it comes to real deli sandwhiches this is it. My second time eating a sandwich from here and it was very very delicious. Turkey or Cornedbeef or any other order you cant go wrong. There's enough parking and easy to find off Beyer. Try them out you won't be disappointed.</Review>

Best sandwich shop in all of the Southbay area. Friendly family owned business. So personal, you will feel like you're a part of their family. Didn't have cash on me and the owner told me to come back and pay later. This kind of service is hard to find these days.</Text>

Best sandwiches in the south bay! You can't go wrong with any one of them. My top ones are the Tuna Melt, Hot and Delicious, Man Handler, and the New Yorker! The owners are super cool and they treat their customers as family. Their open during breakfast and lunch. I'm bummed that they are no longer open for the weekends. Highly recommended!</review>

Only found this place a few years ago but they are the best.  Mom/Pop/Family sandwich shop that take extreme pride in what they serve.  They  greet all their customers as if they were part of their family..... literally makes you feel good before you even get your sandwich.  Sandwiches are nice and hearty...they kind that take two hands to eat and prices are good for what you get.<//Text>

< review>
I made a special trip last month to see this store after checking out this location for literally several years!I called in my order due to the fact that I had a consultation to reach. I remained in the mood for a Sandwich or Pastrami, so I got both the New Yorker as well as the Male Handler, at $7.75 each I assume ... I understood I just had $16 money, as well as I asked the lady if that would certainly suffice, because I had read this was a cash-only area. She stated it was enough, which it would certainly prepare in 15-20 minutes.Cool, so I make the expedition to Beyer Way from Coronado Ave, just southern eastern of the Northgate Market.Heads up, it's not really visible from the road. When you see the San Ysidro Wellness Structure, that's where you turn in. From the clientele coming as well as going, as well as the images on the wall, this area is well respected and enjoyed by police and regular individuals like me. The customer before me was choosing up an order for TWENTY sandwiches(what the heck!)and also the counter was lined with more sandwiches made to order.The proprietor, the lady that took my order, stated to me that I was as well cute when I fretted I didn't have adequate cash. She explained that in all her years there she would certainly never, as well as will never reject any person a sandwich if they didn't have sufficient cash ... Her exact words. They just won an additional consumer for life.:-RRB- This, as well as the whole ambiance, it just really felt like house here.The taste? I was not dissatisfied. The sandwiches were massive and also delicious. I ate them both, I did not share, and I am not embarrassed.<//review>

Phenomenal food, phenomenal attitude, phenomenal service! Would rate it 10 stars if possible, the owners are friendly, compassionate, and go out of their way to make the entire neighborhood feel like family. On our honeymoon and so glad we stopped by - Ended up going twice in just a few days!

Wish there was a place like this near where we lived. Thanks Dena!< /Review>

They are very welcoming and are happy to serve you. The food is very good. I will be going back to try more of their food.

I love Beyer Deli... It's one of a kind sandwich shop that you probably would never find if you didn't know about it. Hands down when I'm in the area I'll always swing by Beyer. The owners are AWESOME too!!! The only down side is that it is Cash Only.</text>

<Review>I am a sandwich snob.  I create the most amazing sammiches yes, sammich, hahaha anyway I am kind of a sandwich snob, so when I say this place made a great sandwich I mean it.  Plus the lady that ran the front was unlogicly happy, polite, and friendly.  It was quite an expierence.</Review><time>1496123226150</time>< pictures>

< Review>
Saturday Morning Farmers Market. Three Babes Bakery Key Lime Pie.
I spent the vast majority of my life in central florida and traveled yearly to key west florida and I will commit floridian blasphemy right here on google maps and go on record saying "San Francisco based women and minority owned Three Babes Bakeshop does, in fact, bake a more delicious key lime pie than any key lime pie that has graced my palate on the caribbean island getaway of Key West, Florida".
Price per slice: $7
Price per pie: $45

PSA: SATURDAY FERRY BUILDING FARMERS MARKET ALLOWS YOU TO UTILIZE CAL-FRESH BENEFITS FOR EVERYTHING EXCEPT HOT FOOD AND FLOWERS. Additionally, they give you $10 free for use on fruits and vegetables only.< /Review>

Lovey building with some interesting history that can be read in the entrance. Visited the building twice during our visit in October, the first was on Saturday morning for the farmers market and then again the following day for breakfast. The Farmers Market that is every Sunday and Tuesday morning is well worth a visit, the produce is amazing and there are a lot of stalls to buy food and drinks from.</review>

Great historical building with interesting architectural details. Fun place to walk around or sit and watch the bay. Not too big for the less mobile people, but contains a decent variety of food stalls and shops in addition to the actual ferry ports. The farmers markets are a fun place to meet and have coffee as the morning weather on the Embarcadero is generally exquisite most of the year. Besides the fresh produce there are multiple vendors offering prepared foods. One of the unique experiences to see in San Francisco on Saturday mornings 8a-2p (also Tu/Th 10-2) and relatively easy by public transit. One of those places where locals and tourists mix.<//Text>

<user_id>116556357736267274624</user_id><rating>5<//rating><username>Anton Vakulchyk<//username><Review>Attention all foodies: this delectable attraction needs to be at the top of your San Francisco to-do list. The Ferry Building Marketplace is a public food market that features a variety of food stalls that act as small restaurants, snack stops and grocery stores. Here you can find everything from staples, such as seafood, burgers, Mexican food and plenty of coffee, to a Japanese delicatessen, empanada stand, nut shop and a cheese and dairy bar.

Many travelers who stopped by the Ferry Building Marketplace visited multiple times during their San Francisco trip. Visitors were impressed with the amount, variety and overall quality of eats available on-site. Though there are formal restaurants available, some visitors say the best strategy is to pick up a to-go meal and enjoy it along the scenic waterfront. And if you're not one for lines, don't come on the weekends.

You can reach the marketplace via the Embarcadero BART/Muni Station and several public buses lines. Parking is also available near the marketplace. The marketplace is open daily from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m with slightly different hours on the weekends. Restaurants and stores, however, maintain varied hours. The farmers market welcomes shoppers from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Tuesdays and Thursdays and from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturdays.</Review>< date>

(Translated by Google) Beautiful port building. At the weekend there is a market on the premises at the back, inside you can find delicious things to buy every day. Everything is not always a free gift, but it has a great flair.

Wunderschönes Hafengebäude. Am Wochenende befindet sich ein Markt auf dem Gelände an der Rückseite, im Inneren finden sich an jedem Tag leckere Sachen zum kaufen. Alles nicht immer unbedingt geschenkt, aber einfach großartig vom Flair.< /text>

Do I even need to explain myself. These patties are paper thin. Save your money!! This place used to be good, but prices have skyrocketed, and clearly quantity hasn't. I recommend Douglas burger near by.< /review>

< Review>
I used to live here in Long Beach and Tam's always has been my favorite fast food place to eat. I now live in Savannah, Georgia and I would dream of going to Tam's. I'm here today on a visit and I couldn't wait to go to Tam's. I did the first day and wasn't disappointed. I have been here a little over a week and I eaten there 90% of the time and I can't get enough of their food. Always extra great food. I wish I could take it back to Georgia with me.< /Review>

Paid $10 for the worst chicken salad ever. I've been to 4 other Tams and never had an issue. The lettuce was hacked into chunks made for a wedge salad, not uniform. Very little chicken with no flavor and no cheese in sight. The ranch was watered down. First Tams that adds a boiled egg and 1/2 inch cucumber slices. I thought Tams used the same recipe throughout their franchises. I ordered through drive-thru and got 41 miles away before I found this disappointment of a salad.<//Text>

Order not hand over correctly it was wrong and missing toppings in a hamburger ask for specific way and at the end only bread and meat they served
This happen when they want to go home in a hurry and not paying attention
Greasy french fries not even properly cook</review>

Anytime I go to Tams I always enjoy the food.. I just wish I wouldn't get interrupted by someone either begging or vendors trying to sell us something. I would like to just go in and enjoy my meal with my family and not get bothered. I think management should be more attentive when it comes to this problem and address the issue when thier customers are being bothered.< /text>

<Rating>3< /Rating><text>I don't know why but everytime I've come to the drive thru at this location it takes REAL LONG . Even if there's only 1 car in front of me. The food also is not as good as other locations I've been to. The burgers are bland and  they serve less fries. I keep coming because I love Tams and just keep hoping this location will get better, but as of Dec 2019 it's still slow and burgers bland. The cashier is always friendly though.<//text>< pictures>

You can't go wrong with a good fast food meal combo from Tam's. This place has a variety of choices for breakfast, lunch and dinner. They may take a little longer than expected but that's because it's not made until it's ordered. Drive through anytime of the day and you can't beat the price. I love their tuna melt. Highly recommended fast food joint!< /text>

Very good food. Quick drive thru. Pleasant staff.
Always consistently a great place for a quick bite with friendly service
The double cheese burger combo was really good
Juicy but not soggy, huge burger and hot fresh seasoned fries...if you like a good fresh cheeseburger (double is the best, and if you really want to go all out,  add chili....and don't forget the 🥓bacon🥓.  WOW)this is where you'll find a killer one.....😏👍🥙< /Text>

Fair pricing. This location really depends on the cooks I would say. Day to day the size of a meal can vary. One day I ordered a carne asada burrito for 9 bucks and it was just a bit bigger than a regular burrito from taco bell (very small) the next day I decided to go back and try again and it was triple the size of the one from the day before and very fulfilling (big). Always want to get my money's worth when spending it on food so now I just talk to them and ask them to hook it up. Don't want to be spending $9-$10 on something that's not gonna fill me up<//review>

Worst owner manager ever. Very rude to senior citizens. He allowed someone walking in off the street to take a table before ordering when I was there with my food and asked him to intervene as my food was getting cold. His reply was I am not going to argue with you. I was not arguing. I simply asked him politely.</review>

<Text>Bad experience never again will I buy food at this tams burger place . Got the fried shrimp dinner when I was about to eat the shrimp they where black from the inside like if they where old frozen shrimp for years . I took the shrimp dinner back and ask to speak to the manger she took a while to come and see me when she came back didn’t even apologize she look like she was 15 years old her name is Guadalupe un profesional to be a store manager of this hamburger place . When you guys go eat here check your food before you take a bite out off it . Nasty as place to eat nothing like the paramount tams burgers< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Foods great they are pretty quick with the drive thru as well. I'd say there food is better than most little fast food restaurants. I don't eat in there to often so I can't say how great the inside is but the food is of great quality so thats what counts most at a fast food restaurants.<//Text>

I have not had anything at this restaurant that I did not like. They have great zucchini and I can get my burger lettuce wrapped without a bun. They have delicious breakfast also. Plus it's a drive through which makes it very convenient.<//text>

If you are looking for the tastiest Chili cheese pastrami fries that can feed three, this is the place. The burgers however, have small patties compared to the buns. The customer service was good and they apoligized for ringing me up the pastrami added to the chili cheese fries but I wouldn't have tried it otherwise. I say that is the best mistake, if you would even call it that.<//Text>

Food was good,clean establishment, ample parking and open late. Lots of food for the price. Only draw back was the bathroom
Was tagged pretty badly, no locks on the stall. I guess  it has to do with the area and clientele  they must get at night.< /Review>

Wow! Im so sad to say this, been coming here for years. My boyfriend and I ordered some food in the drive thru, the person taking our order was hard of hearing and took for ever to order 1 colossal burger and a soda but the worst part was finding a BAG IN MY SODA. what the hell is going on there. When confronting the cashier once we came back, the workers seamed unsympathetic to the situation and would give no information regarding the managers name. We had to do our own searching around for answers. Needless to say were never coming back! People beware Jimi the owner dosnt care, and the foods nasty so i would find another place to eat if I were you</text>

< Review>
Got a collosal burger combo that took some time to cook. Not a big deal in waiting for the food, especially when it's tasty. However opening drive through cashier girl was very unwelcoming and seemed like she did not want to be working there. Just took the payment and shut the window. Second worker that handed me my food was nice and apologized for the wait.</Review>

<text>On 5/27/18 I came to this location: 5353 Atlantic ave. Long Beach, CA 90805 and had a very bad experience. I come here all the time but today was the worst yet! The two females that work here always have a bad attitude but again, today was worse. They do not acknowledge people in a professional manner and never smile nor ask if you need any condiments or anything else. Today they got my order wrong through the drive-thru and until I got home noticed. I called them to inquire on the bad order and when the girl answered the phone, she didn’t say her opening statement, she answered Hello? As if it was a home, not a business. I proceeded to let her know what happened and she told me to bring my receipt and that was all. They did not give me a receipt at the drive thru I told her, since they never do. Businesses should always give receipts or else how will I know I’m getting charged correctly. When I had to go back  to get my order they failed to put in my bag, the girls were nowhere to be found, as if they were ashamed of the way they handled the whole situation. And they should be, because this isn’t right! I should come to a restaurant wanting to come back for their food service. After today, I don’t want to come back to this place anymore. I hope this situation with these workers will be handled in a rightful manner and maybe go through some more training if they’re gonna continue their career here. Very unacceptable and bad experience!!!!<//text>< pictures>

Gone here 3x now. 1st time I ordered a breakfast... waited 25 minutes to get burnt bacon, toast, and hashbrowns and everything was greasy and tasted as if they never clean their grill.
2nd time i got a chicken dinner to take home... everything in the salad was sour and soggy. Chicken tasted like it was cooked on dirty equipment.
Tonight, music on so loud they cant hear you when you order (inside). I ordered a shake along with my combo. Repeated the order back. No shake...

I like Tams but this location sucks in all areas. (Customer service skills, cleanliness, and food quality.)</Text>

I later received my food and tasted it and it tasted like chili water 🤮 and cheese plus I saw the lady put my order to the side while making other people’s food so my fries was cold and it was chili water and cheese I will never order from here AGAIN! The previous chili cheese experiences the lady touched raw meat with gloves then grabbed the cheese with the same gloves and tried to put it on my chili cheese fries. Plus there’s always hair in my food! This place needs to be shut down!< /review>< pics>

Ordered a Colossus burger. Pastrami  wasn't cooked all the way or its old looks grayish fries were fine. Service is horrible most of the time. Sometimes they can be ok. When you ask em for yellow chillies they act like McDonald's with there bbq sauce! Rather go to Douglas.<//review>

I ordered hash browns well done but they were still under cooked and soft.....My omelette was cooked too much , so it was brown and dried eggs .....The toast was not toasted enough so it was still white and soft....I felt like complaining, but didn't....Not coming back forever !!! No wonder why this place is not packed....Bad cooks !< /Text>

Not only did I wait 20 minutes but my order was wrong and when I had her fix my order it came out looking horrible smh I asked for my money back and they did a refund but noticed they placed the machine under OFFLINE so I wouldn’t get my money back ! Have me going back and forth over $10.00 for a mean I didn’t eat and talk about customer service and cheating the customers off their money refund !<//Review>

Never again fish dinner on a late night most of it was full of old fries the fish was small more batter than anything didn't feel like walking back ($11.00 more or less down the drain)
Yuck could've at least served fresh fries.< /text>

<time>1486712915541< /time><rate>1< /rate><text>(Translated by Google) Very bad service, the cashiers serve you with faces that seem to be asking you for gifts and they also wanted to give me what they want.
The last time I went they gave me a hamburger that was not the one I ordered, I returned it and they gave it to me again, I did not want to return it because it gave me more pain to me, but the meat was raw.
VERY BAD

Muy mal servicio , las cajeras te atienden con unas caras qaue parece que les estas pidiendo regalado ademas me han querido dar lo que ellos quieren.
La ultima vez que fui me dieron una hamburguesa que no era la que pedi, la regrese y me la volvieron a dar  mal, ya no quise regresarla  pues me dio mas pena a mi, pero la carne estaba cruda.
