During pandemic they are processing cash and cards and then not changing gloves to handle raw food when they make the bowls with raw fruit. Never again will I go here. They need one dedicated cashier! Gross<//text>

<review>I ordered watermelon juice and matcha ice cream. Watermelon juice was ok. But ice cream was on one the worst one in the area. I am not sure if there was a manager on duty.

They suffered from the same issue the up front taste was good and made you think mmm this is going to be good then nothing but a flat flavorless meh. In drink we did not finish due to this followed by a odd after taste. So it was just meh not Horrible but not great.< /Review>< gmapID>

<review>I had an issue a couple months ago with them not allowing me to pay with Samsung pay (claiming the POS hardware didn't support it - it does). I've met the cofounder personally and was able to get it straightened out after a call to the corporate offices. Today I go to pay with my phone and am directed to a janky sign stating that Apple, Google, and Samsung pay aren't allowed. The cashier explained that the manager considers them too risky because chargebacks/disputes are somehow easier with mobile payments - this is something I've never heard and can't confirm with a cursory Google search. Left another message with corporate to see if this is a company-wide policy. Regardless - the staff was very nice about the whole situation and gave me my order free of charge since I didn't have any other form of payment on me, really appreciated that.< /review>< Time>

Great juices, just know that they stop juicing fresh juices 30 minutes before closing so they can clean the machine. So if your heading in before close make sure you get there on time for your fresh juice:)<//Review>

<Review>The staff at Nekter Tustin is top notch. I have been undergoing a kitchen renovation for the past few weeks and have had to eat out more than I care to admit. After about a week of going here every morning, the staff learned my name and recognized my order. It made for a much more personal and enjoyable experience.<//Review><Date>1553790377811<//Date>< Rating>

<review>I used to give this place 5 stars and been a regular since they opened this location.  The last few trips my drinks seems as it has  been water down or lack of any flavor at all.  My baby even pushed away his Berry Smoothie that he would jump for when he sees his little purple color cup.

I haven't commented to the establishment about this because I'm always on the go and have a baby with me. Hopefully someone from there reads this and take action.

I'm sad to say that I won't be returning to this location any longer.  Hopefully Orchard Hills is up to par if not I'll just have to make the extra drive to Whole Foods or start juicing again on my own.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Review>Love their bowls. So glad they are open later than they were at first :)  8/27-stopped in 2 weeks ago [like beginning of Aug] and the Acai bowl I love was not up to par... very soupy...with barely any bananas on top. When I told the employee... she blamed it on the bananas not being frozen enough.  I told her my Nekter cooler bag had a bad sewing job and was falling apart. She said call corporate. Not happy.</Review>< Pictures>

That means we cut, peel, and prep all of our fruits and veggies ourselves, and that the wait time can be more than some anticipate. We hope you can check out the Nékter Juice Bar App which has online ordering to help! Hope you enjoy and that we see you back very soon!'}<//Response>

< Review>
I’m usually not the type to leave a review but considering the way that my sister and mom were treated I found it necessary. As today is Mother’s Day I treated my mom for a pedicure and so I dropped her off and later came back to pay. My sister decided to get a full set as well, which my mom paid for. I come to find out that the person (I want to say his name is Dominic) that was doing my sisters nails kept asking her if my mom was going to be able to pay for the nails. Seriously??? I am very displeased with this kind of “customer service” if you can even call it that. OBVIOUSLY if they are getting services done they have the money for it. I will not be coming back to this place and I regret ever coming here. So unprofessional. I hope the owner sees this review and addresses my concern. Nobody should ever be belittled like that.<//Review>

I’ve been coming here for years. Love Dominic’s work with acrylic nails. Make an appointment, it can get busy especially on the weekend.
The only thing I don’t like is having to wait 30 minutes over for my appointment because the person before me was  late. It’s happened more than once.<//Text>

I have sensitive skin and everywhere I go they make me bleed, so it’s been awhile since I’ve had my last Pedicure. I am new to EASTVALE and all the nail places there have bad reviews. Shame on them!! But this place in Corona was worth the drive. Thank you so much for helping enjoy my Pedicure. I will be back.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dcb806d2bcd4eb:0xa0ce9f96b9b0dd94<//gmap_id></record>

I paid $70 for gel nails and pedicure the guy made me bleed from my pinky nail & the lady gave me an ingrown toe nail that I did not walk in with. When I asked them how much they said $70 then I told them last time I came it wasn’t $50 because I use to go every 2 weeks and they laughed and said no that must have not been here while they were both doing my hands and feet they were so ruff and they just laughed and talked and didn’t even pay attention to what I was asking for. Very rude! I will never go here again!<//text>

Overpriced, bland, nothing like the pictures on their IG account, no longer serving sushi, and hours are off. Their busiest days are on taco Tuesdays, that says a lot about this place. You have to have an instagram account to check out their menu. Not even that, you have to have service on your phone to check their menu. The tacos aren't even 1 dollar, only the "street tacos" are a dollar...on taco tuesday. The taquero couldn't be bothered to serve the plate with one of each, we were told one plate had to have 3 tacos with only one type of meat. Basically the taquero didn't want to work that day. I missed the chance of going when it opened about a year ago, I'm pretty sure it would have been a totally different experience since everyone in Salinas were hyping this place up. At the end of the service, the guy in charge was pretty much asking for a tip... reminded me of Chinese restaurants. We ended up at about 100 dollars for 16 tacos! The drinks are basic and overpriced. The only magical part about the food was the fried tortilla and the added cheese (this is what made it expensive). The birria is whatever, there are hole in the wall places in Salinas that do a good job with cooking birria, and they actually use goat meat! There are plenty of other good taquerias in Salinas..I mean it is Salinas after all. So much for trying to support local businesses.<//Review>

Here’s the thing about Baja’s. I have gotten great sushi from them before. Love the poke bowls and the zucchini noodle option. I’ve tried going back several times and there’s always an issue—out of rice, out of fish, closed during normal business hours, etc. Overall, I’m very disappointed. It’s been a long time.

If you want poke bowls in Salinas, go to Sushi Hut.<//text>

Food is very tasty, service is good - but boy is it loud. We were there on a Thursday and they were getting ready for a band to set up for live music. It's more of a party atmosphere with tall tables and a jukebox playing music loud enough that you couldn't really talk over. They have something happening daily.< /text>

Been here many times, but never received service this terrible, we walked in and no other partys were there, time went by and many partys came in we got served last. Will not be back its a shame. Would not recommend anymore<//Text>

Terrible. Certainly has gone downhill.  Tables were dirty, unkept, music too loud, and had to send back my order twice to get it right.<//Text>

I had been looking for a local spot that carried Poke Bowls. This spot ended up being perfect as other people I know prefer the mexican food. Great variety of foods both Japanese style amd mexican. The drinks were really great as well. Ill def be back. Also the service was AMAZING. Never in the evening did I have an extra need for anything!< /Text>

<review>Odd location and no actual parking as there is only street parking if you can find it. We were greeted promptly but our waitress took for ever. We just got water with our food and then we ordered sushi rolls. After 40 minutes we received half our order. The other rolls were not even being made, in fact it looked like an employee showed up, the guy making the rolls started talking to her and her friend, mind you our order was not important. I mean hey, we waited now 49 minutes, what's another 40 minutes more right. The teriyaki roll was so dry and just fell apart as I barely touched it. The salmon roll, god I hope that was salmon tasted like old spice with a combination of old and bitter. I said, damn I'm starving, so I ate the salmon rolls, and ate only one chicken teriyaki roll and left the rest. Hint was not captioned, as captain obvious was hung over in the corner un aware that it was a damn horrid sushi roll. My friend canceled his order as it was still not made after almost an hour now. I got charged for my two rolls, I guess they need money and lack common sense. Just because you call it sushi, it isn't sushi son. The service was atrocious and so slow that a sloth could have read me two full bedtime stories and kicked a few rocks. I will never go back and if I was starving and this was the last place on earth and they were giving food for free, I'd rather eat my own manuer because at least I know where it's coming from and it would be fresh.<//review><gmap_id>0x808df9af19721f2f:0xb7d9320a58a7c32f< /gmap_id><time>1552893447332<//time>< pics>

My first time here. The food was pretty creative and good---my friend and I ordered baja tacos, poke tacos, a Korean bbq taco, and a jalapeno roll. We agreed everything was tasty, albeit the tuna in the poke tacos had a slight fishy taste. Here's the thing---be prepared for a mashup of flavors. The menu was unexpected---an aguachile sushi roll (rojo o verde), a Hot Cheetos roll, and the poke taco came in a hard taco shell. It was busy while we were there---and we concluded it's a good place for drinks, and getting a bite to eat...in that order. That being said, they get 4 stars for the understaffing. Our server was handling the whole place herself. Not her fault, but when it gets busy, add the loud jukebox, it's hard to flag down a server for the check. Not to worry, though...we'll be back.</review>

<Date>1617210374761< /Date><review>My first visit here. I was so impressed with the thoroughness of the staff and their attention to details concerning my vision insurance. I rarely find this kind of above and beyond customer attention I immediately knew that they were well trained and knowledgeable.
Dr Devon Kennedy was my physician and she too was very thorough. She asked specific questions regarding the laser vision surgery I had several years ago and have me information about my current eye health ( through tests she had done and reviewed). She explained everything she was doing and what her conclusions were.
I can’t tell you how much I appreciate being treated as a person with a brain instead of just part of an income stream.
Highly recommend!</review>< response>

How wonderful to wake up every morning and not have to “feel” for where you left your glasses. I had mono vision contacts for over 30 years. My vision for reading and distance is now perfect. No distance or reading glasses needed.
After the first surgery I could see well but needed distance glasses for driving. I had much simpler surgery again on my distance eye & now I no longer need glasses for anything.  It was a wonderful experience! Thank you DLV for my sight!!<//Text>

< Review>
The entire process was seamless. The DLV staff is fantastic. They were very friendly and professional. Dr. Dougherty was very informative and his professionalism made me feel like I was in good hands. The facilities are very clean and all the equipment is state of the art.  And my surgery went off without a hitch and the results are truly remarkable! In one day, in went from barely being able to see a foot in front of me to having 20/15 vision (better than 20/20). I really can't thank Dr. Dougherty and his amazing staff enough. It is a life changing service they offer our community and they perform that service to the top of it's class.<//Review>

Dougherty vision staff is very friendly and efficient.. This is my second surgery with them, the first one was ICL surgery which was life changing, amazing! The second surgery I have to be honest didn’t turn out as well. But I’ve been assured by the staff that they will do whatever possible to correct my vision to its full Potential. I would highly recommend Dougherty vision.</Review>

When Dr. Lee determined  the severity of my problem, he and the staff made all the arrangements for me to meet with a retina specialist immediately following my appointment in their office.  They gave me hope and confidence that everything was going to work out just fine since the problem was detected soon after I started having the symptoms. I am very grateful for the empathy and compassion they gave me.  Lastly, the office is so very well organized, clean, and everyone working there is absolutely on point.

<review>I had a good experience with Dougherty Laser Vision. Staff were very friendly and I had good care. The procedure itself was painless, however I was bit alarmed by the the burning smell during the procedure as that wasn't explained to me prior to it happening. The only complaint I have was the amount of time I had to spend waiting for the procedure. I arrived at 8:15 and did not get the procedure until 1 pm; almost 5 hours later. I was told it would take between 2-3 hours. Since we had to drive 2 hours from Santa Maria my poor husband had to wait 5 hours in the car (Covid prevented him from waiting in the waiting room). I would recommend others to Dougherty Laser Vision but let them know to be prepared to wait and to bring a good book (for the patient and the driver) to pass the time.</review>< pics>

From day one everyone that I encountered was very friendly. Any questions I had they would give or get me the answer right away. The day of surgery was exciting. It seemed like everyone was more excited than me about getting it done. I woke up the next morning seeing 20/15. No pain or discomfort. If I was a spider with 8 jacked up eyes I would have it done here right away.</text>

Amazing results with my ICL surgery from Dr. Dougherty! 4 days later and my vision is perfect. Prompt and accurate communication from my patient counselor leading up to my surgery was an issue but everything else about my experience was great!<//text>

I have had several appointments and yesterday I had laser treatment for my glaucoma. Dr. Vosoghi is a wonderful doctor. He is compassionate, explains everything so you can understand what he is doing and why and I am so glad I was referred to him. I have been to both the Simi Valley office and the Westlake office. Every employee is polite and kind from the front office, assistants, etc.  I have had all good experiences and highly recommend Dougherty Laser Vision. A big thank you.< /text>

I was very pleased with Dr. Dougherty, he was very kind and gave me my eyesight back. So grateful.

The initial consultation with the finance gal was good, however, many times she did return my phone calls until I sent her 2 or 3 reminders.
She was not clear as to how the plan worked with my insurance company which led to out of pocket expenses on the day of surgery.
Perhaps better training and follow up will be beneficial for their patients<//text>

Dr.Dougherty performed my Lasik surgery nearly 15 years ago and now that I have developed cataracts I knew he was the person I would trust my eyes with once again. The staff at the Westlake office is incredible! From the minute you enter the office to every step along the way you are greeted with a smile and a feeling of welcome. The Specialty Surgical  Center where my eye surgery was performed is staffed with the same quality individuals! From the front desk to all of the nurses. The care I received in both facilities is superb! My 2nd eye will be completed in a couple of weeks and I have no doubt that the quality of care will be the same!< /text>

< review>
I had the multi focal lenses and LASIK done 10 days ago, my vision is 💯 with no prescription needed! I could not see near or far without my glasses and I have astigmatism, yesterday I threaded a needle, I haven’t been able to do that for 25 years!  Dr Bala, Rhina her assistant and the rest of the staff are amazing. DLV gave me a piece of my life back.  Thank you so very much.  My husband is scheduled in April!<//review>

What I quickly learned about DLV was that the people were great, they kept their promises,  my appointments were on time and they were very responsive. Had cataract surgery yesterday and the facility was first class and Dr. Bala did a terrific job. Scheduled surgery today to have my other eye taken care of.<//Review>

Every appointment was kept on time and even early.  I was very impressed.  The catarac surgery on both eyes was comfortable, done extremely fast and most important I can see distances without the aid of glasses.  At 74 years of age, you gave me a new lease on life.  I intend to enjoy it to the fullest. My only regret is that you aren't in Arizona as I am moving back home.  Thank you so much for all your services and everything you did for me.</text>

<Text>Someone poked me in the eye a week after my surgery. Had to come in to get evaluated and I'm glad I did. They had to do emergency surgery since my pupil was "leaking out". Pilupils back to normal thanks to Dr. Bala. The staff was great too. I hadn't eaten lunch and they didn't want me to leave so Safina door dashed me a food.</Text><time>1616988720999<//time><Pictures>None< /Pictures><UserId.>112106797989610241667<//UserId.><resp>{'time': 1615929878404, 'text': "Hello.

<Name>John Byrd< /Name><text>My wife Lyn and I decided to have our eyes done. Meaning, lense replacement surgery.
76 and 75 year old patients.

Don't remember by whom the recommendations came from, most likely through our research,  we ended up at DLV in Westlake.

Went through all the processes and decided we would go through the procedure.

Now, Lyn was gung-ho but I,  on the other hand, was just as enthused but thought, this doc's going to be screwing with these eyes. The professionalism of office staff, and "this doc's" experience and confidence, allowed those thoughts to dissipate.

The basis for this transformation was well deserved for from the moment Lyn & I entered the Surgery Center door we were taken care of promptly and with showing care from a very adequate staff.

Through the pre op process you will not be neglected,  if fact I was pretty damn cozy. Not a worry in the world.  Again, very professional and adequate staff. By the way, rooms, clean as a whistle.

We both decided for the Panoptix Trifocal Intraocular lens.

At this point, one day subsequent we are very happy with result.

However,  as to the procedure, no pain at all. The worst part, if you want to call it out, was an intervenious poke and that was nothing.
That in itself shows the expertise of Dr. Dougherty and for the aforementioned reasons we recommend DLV for your lazer vision eye care.

Looking forward to the second eye.

This is my first time reviewing in google. The LASIK DLC  did was professional, quick and safe, getting LASIK is probably the best decision I made in 2020. The staffs at DLC are super friendly too, they chat with you, check everything and use modern machines. Overall a great experience, being able to see from the second I wake up is life-changing.</review>

I have had cataracts causing my vision to worsen over the years.  Several doctors have identified this for me and I finally decided to have it corrected.  So far, I have just had the left eye repaired (last week).  I had the cataracts removed and an HD lens implanted.  Dr. Dougherty conducted the surgery and I am very pleased with it (5 days later).  The staff and facility are top-of-the-line GREAT.  I look forward to having my right eye done next week.  I expect the same top-quality treatment, care and results.< /Review>

<review>Everyone at Dougherty Laser Vision has been WONDERFUL!!!  Dana Batista was very friendly, helpful, professional and walked me through all of the options available for my Cataract surgery.  I had my procedure on 10/28/20 at the Specialty Surgery Center, in Westlake!  Everything there went smoothly with great staff that were very friendly, professional and helpful.  My surgery was fantastic!!!  No pain at all and it was a complete SUCCESS!!!  The nurses and Dr. Dougherty were amazing!  I am home now and everything is going according to schedule.  No pain, my vision is coming along fine and I am going to see my eye doctor at Lenscrafter, in Thousand Oaks, for my day after surgery check up.  I am expecting to receive an A+ from my optometrist.
I highly recommend all of the above services for anyone needing Cataract or any other type of eye surgery!!
I get my second eye surgery done next week and I am confident everything will go as well as my first surgery!

In my experience, all the staff are friendly and helpful. They listen to your concerns and collaboratively set out a game-plan for your care. In my 12+ visits to their offices over the years, I've never spent an inordinate amount of time in the waiting room - appointments are on-time, which tells me they value my time too. I would definitely recommend this office for eye care.<//Review>

<review>I must say, the consultation process was the worst I’ve ever experienced in a medical office. It wasn’t about what I wanted, it was about what they could sell me and how fast. Too many opinions by too many with absolutely no consistency from each. Instead of having clarity about what was the best procedure for me, I walked away confused and extremely untrusting of this provider. I would NEVER let them touch my eyes. It’s not about people there, it’s about money. Never again...</review>< Rating>

<user>102136718024625025379</user><text>The people at the facility are pleasant and thorough. The surgery was quick and professional. Beware the upsell. Make sure you ask about all options as they will pitch only the most expensive. Ask questions. My cataract surgery went well. I can see better at night and see the difference between black and blue again. What they didn't tell me was that my macular degeneration would continue to impede my vision so did I need the super expensive lenses?, likely not. My bad for not asking I guess, but I feel it's something they should have told me. I could have saved thousands with that information.
The experience was fine, but be prepared to miss at least 3 days of work and time off for pre-surgery physical and multiple eye appts before and after. The procedure was quick but there is so much more than that. Just ask lots of questions and make an informed decision even if that means delaying surgery until you grasp everything that's involved. Regrets? A few. I was too eager to see again and spent way more money than I needed to. Oh and insurance doesn't cover the lenses, laser assisted surgery the surgical center or anesthesiologist, so out of pocket is several thousand dollars. Would I do it again? Just the cataract surgery without all the extras, yes.</text>< pictures>

< review>
I had cataract surgery and lense replacement with Dougherty Laser Vision. I could see so much better than before. They told me after I  heal the lense would cloud as part of the healing. I waited a long time and my vision was poor. I called and got an appointment to schedule for polishing the lense. They did my worst eye first and afterwards I felt like I was cured of color blindness because there was such a dramatic improvement. They really are passionate about helping people see better.<//review>

The entire staff at DLV are very professional and provide a warm and genuinely caring environment. Dr. Dougherty performed an IOL on my right eye which was highly successful. Their experienced staff also diagnosed a retinal detachment on my left eye. Due to their ability to provide immediate response they assisted in saving my vision. I highly recommend DLV.<//review>

Amazing staff and amazing doctor! I am so grateful to my optometrist for referring me to Dr. Vosoghi. He has taken me under his wing and has really been a great support and help for an eye condition I am dealing with. He explains things thoroughly and is always happy to answer questions and clarify anything that may need it. Many times the doc may be good, but the staff is horrible....not in this case. The staff and front desk personnel are so friendly and helpful. It is such a pleasure.< /Review>

The whole staff and surgery assistant where really nice and caring, I felt really comfortable. The day of my surgery "Broke" took very good care of me.  I had mentioned I was super scared. She went above and beyond to make sure I felt ready.  My surgeon was Dr. Paul Dougherty,  hands down best surgeon ever!!! The surgery was like 10 minutes and I had no pain and no discomfort.  I highly recommend this office.< /review>

<Text>Great food!  We took a chance and let the waiter pick our dinner for the night and it was a great idea.  The Tea Leaf salad was very delicious.  The drinks are so so (best to just stick with a beer).  If it is a weekend night, make sure to call in advance for reservations.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Gmap_id>

This place is great!  But be ready to wait outside for a table.  Try the tea leaf salad, it's great!  My date and I had Sunday brunch, so the wait was only about 20 minutes, but I hear the dinner wait is much longer, the place is small, and the service is slow, but the food is worth it all!  That's why I couldn't give them the 5th star.<//Text>

Awesome, spicy food. Great service. It was my first time here so I asked for a recommendation. I ended up going with the drunken noodles with chicken, which was full of spicy veggies and tasty chicken.< /review>

<text>Best food and service for the price you pay for. The type of restaurant where you can blindly order anything and be satisfied. The only thing to complain about is their drinks but I'm usually satisfied with water.<//text>< UserId.>

Got take out yesterday. Fast service and well packaged food. Survived the trip back to the hotel. We got Panang chicken, Tom Kha soup, Drunken Noodles, and Mango Sticky Rice. Everything was great. Would definitely go here again. Service with a smile, and great "social distancing" during the pickup.<//text>

< Review>
Was craving for some Thai food and decided to check this place out since it was close by. Came in around the afternoon and it wasn't packed; finding a seat was relatively easy. I ordered pad Thai and a curry. Pad Thai was flavorful, wet, and delicious. Really enjoyed it. The chicken curry was also really good, definitely a bit spicy but the flavors and aroma were exceptionally good. I really liked the decor as well, a large open space with wooden tables and seats. Overall, had a good time and enjoyed the food.<//Review>

As far as it being Thai food, it tastes great. But... if you have any negative reaction to hot pepper seeds, they are in EVERYTHING and don’t let them tell you otherwise.< /Text>

<review>Came in on a Sunday evening. Wasn’t too busy, two people in front of us and it took over a half hour to receive our to go order. Unfortunately after getting home, the Fried Tofu was cold and not enjoyable. The food is typically on point and this was our first time at the East Village location. I think IF we decide to give 55 Thai a try again we will stick to the Golden Hill location where last time everything was quicker and no issues.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<text>I would recommend starting out with the Thai fried rice if you've never had Thai food so you can get a sense of what the flavors are like. I'm positive you'll fall in love with this place as fast as I did.<//text>< pictures>

This place is pretty amazing. It hides in plain site here in my neighborhood of East Village.  My chick and I have been about 3 times within the past months and the food never disappoints. Particular faves are the yellow and green curries... The pad Thai and the Thai fried rice. The customer service is always on point as well.<//text>

<Review>Very good fast Thai food. Really like the option to get stir fry served over veggies instead of rice. Curries are maybe 2-3/10 spicy default, some dishes hotter. Usual options available to heat things up if you must 😊 Thai style iced tea and coffee available, boba optional.</Review><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80d9535f57b371a9:0x86141ad8de93f0ae</GmapID><user>103977350237478234959< /user>< Pics>

<Text>It's all the amazing food and cheap prices of the original Golden Hill location in a bigger location.  Don't let the exterior fool you, the inside is BIG and gorgeous.  A great place for lunch (keep in mind they will be BUSY) or dinner (decidedly less busy).

A MUST if you are downtown.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

The noodles were more like tasty glue authentic Thai food, there were insufficient vegetables, and contrary to every Thai recipe there were no peanuts nor peanut sauce, and the blase Not-Thai help in the restaurant was no help at all.

I'm joining with several of my friends to turn thumbs down on 55 Thai.  Every restaurant in that space has failed, and sadly here comes another failure... I give them no more than 6 months.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80d9535f57b371a9:0x86141ad8de93f0ae< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Best price for thai food in downtown.

Incredible family run business with interior designed by the owner.

Fantastic experience and wonderful service.

I.e. I eat here at least once a week.<//Review>

<review>The 55 Thai Kitchen opened it's door to new customers less than a month ago. This locale - at1010 Broadway - is their third restaurant in the San Diego area ( There is one at SDSU at 5157 College Ave. and a second that is located in Golden Hill at 2601 Broadway. ).
I haven't eaten any Thai food lately however, whenever I've decided that I wanted to dine out at a Thai restaurant, I've always had several regular choices in mind : The new 55 Thai Kitchen is only a few blocks from my current apartment, so my choice was quite simple ; it's also across the street from Papa John's Pizza and Hodad,s Hamburger Place too.
Since I've never eaten any Thai dishes, served with curry - I'm much more familiar with foods from India, as they serve up many different curry dishes - I was surprised to learn that there are areas in Thailand that use quite a bit of curry, as a part of their dishes.
About two weeks ago, I talked to lady who had just dined there and she told me that their curry plates are very good! It wasn't until the 1st of June, that I received my check - I always try to save some money in order to dine out - so I decided to try 55 Thai Kitchen.
I ordered their " Curry" plate to go and it was awesome. My curry plate came with a generous helping of "healthy" brown rice and the curry itself contained slices of red and green peppers, potatoes and a very GENEROUS helping of both chicken and beef strips - the meats were exceptionally tender - in their spicy curry broth ( The plates come with a choice of chicken, beef or shrimp and it you want two meats, then it's $1 extra ).
I received quite a bit of help from their knowledgeable staff, as to the menu item that I had chosen and a good lesson in regards to Thailand and it's curry.
They have sixteen items on their menu, which includes appetizers, soup/salad, noodles and plates,as well as a variety of drinks too. Their prices are very reasonable and no plate is more than $9 in price.
The decor inside of their restaurant is quite beautiful; the tables are all made of polished wood, there are some nice plants and a skylight near the back, all creating a really neat dining atmosphere - a relaxing ambience/a good place for a few friends or else a small business get together.
I'm sure that all of their menu items are as good as both their "Yellow Curry" and "Green Curry" plates and I highly recommend that,  if you like any type of Asian foods, that you give them a try.
I tried 55 Thai Kitchen two more times over the 4th of July Holiday; one time I ordered my favourite, a yellow curry plate with chicken and beef and the second time I ordered shrimp, instead of beef.
I found that I now prefer to order indoors. My green curry plates had so much thinly sliced tender marinated white chicken breast in them, along with either beef or shrimp-the latter are only $1 extra-and with steamed carrots,squash and slices of red and green peppers, in a spicy flavoured broth; when I mixed my brown rice with everything, I had so much food that I could barely finish it.
While I was there, a large group of people came in and ordered and whatever they ordered, it sure looked good.
I just can't believe the amount of food you can get for only $9.70-inc.tax. The interior is simply beautiful, the music is great and I highly recommend that next time you'd like a really unique and cultural dining experience, that you give 55 Thai Kitchen a try.< /review>< rating>

They have a side option of vegetables instead of rice. I wish more places did this. Very close to sdcc - 10 minute walk.</review></record>

Their flavor combinations are unique and delicious. We had two different cups, the campfire and the dirty. The campfire is Smores in a cup, which I see often in creameries but man, do they do it right. The dirty was an horchata ice cream, cinnamon dream. The staff is super helpful and patient. A new must go to place in Garden Grove!< /review><user>103819039546780984700<//user><gmap_id>0x80dd28761f951a3f:0x9cf3dd61228548f5<//gmap_id>< rate>

Rolled ice cream. The taro was good. My only complaint is that there was no seating. They had no bathroom, and told me to go to the dessert place next door....< /Review>

<Review>Came here to satisfy a craving for something cold & refreshing. This hit the spot! I had the Purple Rain - taro ice cream with purple condensed milk, rainbow sprinkles, fruity pebbles, pirouette straw, cherry & whipped cream. The Taro was not overwhelming & blended well with everything else. The ice cream was rolled perfectly. Not too soft. Not too hard. Well worth the price. Friendly service as well. Check 'em out!< /Review>< pictures>

Rolled ice cream. Love the ambiance and original flavors and unique presentation. Great balance of flavor and texture. Definitely coming back and spreading the news like Gideons.< /Text>

<review>While not as good as Blue Nova, The Joint Creamery is much the same idea and pretty good. What I applaud it for are the unique flavors like the black sesame. They offer durian and green tea as well as traditional flavors like strawberry. Being in an Asian area of town, the more Asian flavors are popular and honestly taste better. Not overly sweet and decently priced. Service is fine, mostly college students. They are open till 11 on the weekends.<//review>< pics>

Fun ice cream rolls. Great combinations. Mix of Asian & American flavors. Love watching make the ice cream rolls.
In a little strip mall with other types of Asian coffee & food shops,. Staff are really nice & helpful. I love the Asian flavors best because I think you can get American flavors anywhere.</Review>

Old, hard marshmallows on the S'mores option. Something left a nasty, bitter taste in my mouth afterwards. I told them to add a lot of cinnamon on top, but the flavor was so bland. Was it wood shavings? IDK! Not enough chocolate, crackers, or marshmallows to make it taste like a S'mores either. Ultimately it went from mediocre to disgusting.<//Text>

<Review>Searching for some ice cream while staying in Anaheim led me here. What an amazing place. The ice cream was so delicious!! The vietnamese coffee was my favorite but the horchata was a close 2nd. Not too heavy on the stomach and just so tasty!!</Review><Rating>5< /Rating>< gmap_id>

On the internet it said  that the store was open and it wasn’t. Take the open sign down off of the internet because it is closed. This was a waist of time and gas!!!<//Review>

It's very nice looking inside, but unfortunately there is no sitting inside, because there is no space for it. Food looks good, but it's not very appealing, I've had better...fast service.< /Text>

I am so thrilled to have found Satori! They offer so many time options that I can always make it to a class. Pricing is very reasonable. Its very convenient if you work in, or near, the financial district. And the teachers are top-notch. I would describe Satori as more true to yoga than the other "fitness" focused locations around the area. My favorite teacher is Rea Zambo. She is incredibly knowledgeable about the practice which is apparent in her instruction, and her warm & welcoming personality keeps me going back. I always leave her classes feeling uplifted.<//Review>

I found Satori because I work close-by and a colleague introduced me to the studio. I absolutely love Jennie's class. Her classes are always challenging and she encourages you to push harder each week. I also love that she starts by talking a little bit about astrology. I now go at least once a week!< /review>

Satori Yoga Studio offers a host of yoga classes that target holistic wellness, deep stretching, flexibility, and in general are so fun and informative! I would highly recommend this yoga studio to anyone (beginner - advanced). I am a beginner myself, but can already say that this studio has increased my love for yoga tremendously.<//text>

I have practiced at Satori for almost 3 years.  The space is calm, welcoming and a genuinely accepting community.  There are a wide range of practices to choose from and varying levels from novice to Yogi.  Satori is an inclusive community serving young adults and older students of varying levels of fitness.  Courses are offered throughout the day, evenings and weekends.    The instructors are well trained and engaged.  There are a range of payment options from drop in to monthly unlimited.  The central location makes lunch and evening classes in the financial district easy to fit in a busy schedule.< /review>

I'm new to yoga and I've recently been enjoying the Prenatal Yoga classes with Rebecca Hersh: she's very professional. Clean and friendly studio. My only regret is that they accept too many registrations in regards of the size of the room. I would personally enjoy the class better if we were not that squeezed. Due to the high density, the temperature get quickly warm.</Text>

My favorite yoga studio in the city. They recently moved into a new space, which is smaller, but the vibe and quality of instruction has not changed. It may get pretty crowded during after work classes, but they always try to accommodate all the late-comers. The classes and instructors change throughout the day / week, so you can pick whatever matches how you feel that day. I was not particularly happy about the recent price increase, but I can imagine the convenience of the location in the financial district is embedded in the price!
Just checked out an amazing restorative yoga class with Raquel, have not felt so relaxed in a while!< /text>

Satori is exactly the zen calm I was looking for in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the financial district and my work day. The studio offers a variety of classes throughout the day. It has a calm, friendly and inviting vibe. I've been to several studios in the city and this is definitely one of my favorites!!<//text>

<Text>I really love this yoga studio. I have tried several in the city and this is one of my favorites, if not the best.  The only downfall for me is the location: closer to my work than my home, which makes me reluctant to come on the weekends. Their week day schedule is very accommodating and the options fit well in a busy workday.  All the teachers are amazing, and work on your form not just pushing through Asana's.  They accommodate if you are running a few minutes late or need to leave early.

It is really a blessing to have such an amazing retreat in the middle of FIDI. Even the doormen are friendly and welcoming!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I love, love, love this yoga studio.  It's conveniently located downtown which makes it easy to go at lunch.  I have taken Yoga Nidra Meditation, Yoga for Stress Relief and Candlelight flow.  I really love the first two for meditation and stress relief in the middle of the work day.  The flow class was a butt kicker and I really felt like I got a great workout.  Definitely recommend this studio and especially the meditation classes.< /Review>

Great Yoga Studio close to Fidi so you can go right after work.  They have cucumber flavored water available while you wait for the next yoga class.  They have little cubby holes for your shoes and small items.  There are also cubby holes inside the studio for wallets and purses.< /text>

Got a real well needed full body workout from the vinyasa class and plan to go back. I only wish the evenings classes were 60 mins instead of 90mins. After working a 9hr day I just can't muster up the energy to go a 6:30 class and get home after 8pm. I think you really need that winding down portion of the workout so I haven't been back yet for this reason. I'm hoping with the move to a new studio there will be shorter after work classes.</Text>

Satori is a welcome oasis in the middle of the FiDi; just up the street from my office so there is no excuse about not going to yoga at lunch or after work!  There is a good variety of classes here, from restorative/nidra/meditation (Amy Swart is a favorite of mine) to power vinyasa (Rebecca Rogers is an amazing, inspiring teacher to power up a lunch hour class).<//Review>

<review>Andrea has gathered the best caliber of caring, knowledgeable, inspiring teachers overall of any studio I've known.  Frequent Iyengar and Alignment-based hatha offerings are the perfect complement to flow classes. In fact, I count on Iyengar's precise alignment and long pose-holding to make me stable and strong and keep me injury free in vinyasa classes. Iyengar is the basis of yoga and any serious student should not shortcut their practice without truly understanding the foundation of the asanas.I'm grateful for Satori and would recommend to all to get to know this sweet studio, conveniently located 1 block from Montgomery BART.  Favorite teachers:  Adrienna (Iyengar), Beata (Alignment Based Hatha), Olivia (Pilates),<//review>< Date>

My favorite teacher was Anne Barbaret. She does Iyengar Yoga which has a really strong focus on proper alignment, which was perfect for me as a beginner with some back issues. Anne was terrific about helping me modify some poses when I told her about my back concerns. I had wanted a class where I would have time to figure out how to do the pose correctly so as not to strain my lower back, as well as find my balance for the harder poses. The more fast-paced "flow" classes move pretty quickly from one pose to the next, so they were more challenging for me to keep up (and keep my balance).

For example, I took Hatha Flow yoga with Magi Khoo once and she was good. I worked up a nice sweat with some of the poses even though I wobbled through some of them. I took the same class with Allie Stark and she is a little more fast-paced than Magi. Even if the class is labeled as Level 1-3, Allie focuses on more advanced poses, like handstands, which was pretty intimidating for me. Allie seems to be a very popular teacher though because her classes are PACKED; if you arrive late, there is barely any floor space left for you.

I also took Monique Haan's Yin Yoga class once. There is a lot of meditation and it's definitely the slowest type of yoga, so it's great for de-stressing and easing into yoga after an injury, but not so much for working up a sweat.

There are several changing stalls and two very clean bathrooms. They also provide drinking water. Unfortunately there are no showers at this location. Satori Yoga is supposed to be moving to a new location soon on Sutter and Montgomery, and they've announced that they won't have showers there either.</Text>< pictures>

Good experience. It's pricey but if you can afford , it's worth going .. it can get intense but felt so good after that.< /Text>

Really good wings!!! I am from out of town. Originally from the east coast. While here working my coworkers, and I, try to find good food to eat in the area. When I got the hankering for some wings SoCal Wings was the first place to pop up in the Google search. I was impressed. Friendly service. Great tasting wings, and dipping sauces. I will be returning!!!<//text>

First time eating at Socal Wings. Friendly, fast service, good size portions of boneless wings. The spicy garlic buffalo sauce was perfectly spicy & very tasty. My husband really liked the spicy lemon pepper dry rub & the cajun fries are very good as well. We are looking forward to trying other flavors on the menu.< /review>

< review>
Rounding up from a 4.5.  It's in the back of the corner of a building structure, unassuming wing joint that is serving up a plethora of items from their menu.  Parking can be a bit of an issue though.

My favor I was the boneless wings in lemon and pepper sauce.  I will definitely be coming back for that.  My husband's chicken tenders were gigantic.  There's no rub or sauce on the chicken available for the tenders but you can get an order of sauce on the side.  The cheesy tots were great, we had a small order and we split it amongst the three of us.

My friend ordered wings, chicken fried rice, and onion rings.  He enjoyed himself immensely and was so happy to be there.

On Wednesday they have 75 cent wings.  I might have to try that out too.

There was plenty of food ordered and tons to take back home.  There's a lot of specials on the walls too.  The cashiers were helpful and the food came out promptly and hot!< /review>

I got the waffle fries which were amazing! Seasoned waffle fries, not like chick-fil-a!
I also got popcorn chicken, naked.. this was really strange. They weren’t cooked crispy, and had a strange grey color. They tasted like they had a cinnamon breading?
My 3yr old wouldn’t touch them because of the cinnamon smell.
Might try again sometime, but order a different chicken item.</Text>

<review>Wings were okay. I got the spicy lemon pepper, house, and mango madness (I think this is the right flavor name). The vibe is cool, playing mostly hip hop on the television. Wings are bigger than wingstop, so that's good. Flavors are just alright, nothing too special.<//review>< pictures>

Pros:
Friendly employees, tasty wings, rubs and sauces, able to order unbattered wings and decent prices.
Cons:
First off...I realize this is my problem but nutrition info is supposed to be available. No nutritional values available.  Descriptions are not sufficient to make a good decision on what to order.  I'm both diabetic and living a Keto lifestyle.   I need either better ingredient descriptions or complete nutrition facts in order to make an educated decision on what to order.
Second... no online ordering.
Lastly... sauced wings tend to be soggy
Overall: solid choice for wings in Westminster. You can get bigger wings at Wingstop but nowhere near the flavor.< /review>

Family tried Blazing Phoenix, Spicy Garlic, Blazing Hot, and regular Buffalo. Most spicy was actually the buffalo but even so, not that much. SoCal fries were tdf. Fries were the bomb. Seasoned but not sweet!< /Review>

<Review>I first wanted to say that I love this place and usually order the socal fries (the best!!)

I placed an online order on 12/29/20 via Google's order options. Hours said that they were open that day. Little did I know that they were closed for renovations that day. I suppose they forgot to update on Google (I did check Yelp and it did say closed for renovations AND I'm sure this was just an honest mistake)

Tried cancelling my order, but was charged anyways. Then I tried emailing (no response yet) and contacting the store, but was redirected to contact Postmates since they handle the online orders (was given automated responses due to Postmates' lack of customer service).

Again, love this place. Just wanted to see if there's some way we could resolve this!</Review><userid>113604532254237842969< /userid>< Pics>

The wings are priced reasonabley and every flavor I tried is good.  The staff asks questions which is good since ordering is more complicated then it needs to be. The flavors and rubs are on separate sheets of paper not on the menu.
Small place I would classify as hole in the wall. With Covid takeout only.< /text>

Probably the best wing place in Orange County. The drinks there are pretty tasty. My favorite would be strawberry lemonade. The workers are aways really nice!!

Try the garlic parmesan.< /Review>

I’ll start off by saying that this place is seriously amazing and underrated. The wings are great and well cooked. The place is clean and well maintained. Staff is very helpful when it comes to explaining variety and wing flavors. I recommend any wing lover to give it a try. If you do end up going, try the House Special.</Text>

The only place I'd go to for anything chicken. Way better than booffalo wings. Huge portions, large section of flavors that can satisfy your itch.</text>

Got the mango madness (wet sauce) and the jalapeño pepper (dry). Both were tasty, juicy and flavored well. Also ordered the salt and pepper shrimp and it was underwhelming, unfortunately. Also got a passion fruit smoothie with crystal Boba.... It was tasty but a bit sweet.< /review>

The wings here are better than Hooters or Buffalo Wild Wings.  I love their Cajun fries and assorted specialty drinks.  The staff are very helpful and nice.  The only minor complaint is the parking lot is kind of small so you might have to park in the street.</Text>

My mother and I came in for dinner, and greeted with a friendly staff. The food was amazing! Nice meaty wings, solid onion rings, crispy waffle fries, and delicious fried zuchini. Everything came out in a timely fashion hot fresh and ready to eat. This will be a spot that I continuously visit. Thank you much!<//review>

<text>I have gone there three times. I  like there wings the flavor. I would like more if they changed  and cleaned there oil. The chicken has a burned smell and dark color due to dirty oil.  I still gave them a 3 but I would definitely score higher is they cleaned the oil. Not sure if  I  will be back.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

The wings here are fantastic. There is a nice variety of flavors to choose from, and the wings are an excellent price. Parking is limited, as it is a small corner plaza. I haven't had all the milk teas but the ones I did have were all right, not the best. Despite the place itself being small, it is clean and comfy.< /Review>

Everything about SoCal Wings is 100% on point! Once you walk in they greet you, take your order quickly. They're very nice and we received our food, reallly fast. We ordered the 2 for $20, 15 wings, 2 small drinks & 2 small sides. The flavor for the wings were Lemon Pepper, Garlic Parmesan & Honey Garlic Siracha, with cajon fresh & fried zucchini. ALL were soooo delicious!!! Everytime we go we are completely SATISFIED, HAPPY & FULL!</Review>

Good mix of wet & dry flavors. Also good selection of drinks. A part of me wanted beer to go with the great taste of wings, but I don't think that's what they're going for. Didn't get to try the sides other than the coleslaw, but that was good. Friendly staff​ and explained everything great for a first time customer.<//text>

I love the wings here. If you unsure of what sauce you want, they give you a sample of it. The staff is patient with customers and always kind. I love that they have music playing and have pictures with each of the staff on it. They don't have a wide selection of soda, only 5 different coca-cola brand sodas. Also, the staff is a little slow with making the food however.<//review>

The service was great, and the cashier was very helpful in explaining everything as it was our first time there. I also appreciated that when you ordered to go, you can get the sauce on the side so your wings don't get soggy. They also offer dipping sauces, but I didn't think it was necessary since the wings came already flavored. I really liked the house special wings, but I look forward to coming back to try the jalapeno pepper flavor.</Text><pics>None< /pics><user>111706424352952303871<//user></record></dataset><record>

Great alternative to Buffalo wild wings. I would prefer this joint than waiting for a table at BWW. Small place and parking is very limited. Not great for big groups, a place for a party 2-4 people. Great wings! Great selection of sauce. If you like spicy, this place has got you covered!</Review>

I've been driving by this place for a few months. Always thought I'd try it one day.  Yesterday my Fiancé said hey let's check out So Cal Wings I agreed. So we went and I was a little upset I waited all of these months.  I've been missing out on this great service, great food, great atmosphere.  This place rocks!

They even have a rewards program!!! So, we are here again for lunch today! 2 days in a row! Super excited about this place!<//review>

<review>Really good food, and lots of it! Definitely not the cleanest, or easiest to find, but they had tons of options for wings and a dozen appetizers to choose from, as well as different beverage options, combos, and more. This is a great place!<//review>< pics>

AMAZING WINGS! Highly recommend this place. They are always coming up with new wing flavors. They also have many other options available for those who don't like wings. My personal favorite are the spicy buffalo and kickin' lemon.</review>

Great wings, great selection of drinks. My favorite rubs for wings is house special, and dynamite. For drinks, I like the Hokkaido, and Taro milk teas.<//review>

<Text>Best place to get boba and wings. The whimsical lemonade is amazing 20/10. I recommend the Asian hot wings with cajun dipping sauce. The cashier's are the nicest people and customer service is terrific.

Also the bobas are good enough that you dont need to stop by another boba store for dessert when its there with the wings ready to be eating together.< /Text>< rate>

The honey siracha sauce is the best. The house sauce is good. The sweet BBQ dry rub is nice like a chipotle flavor. The parmesan wings aren't that great, just tossed in butter and sprinkled with grated parmesan. The Cajun fries aren't as good as the seasoned fries.< /review>

<text>I like Socal Wings. They're pretty delicious and have lots of wing flavor options. Both dry and wet. Bone in and boneless. I like the variety.</text>< Pictures>

Awesome place, staff and food. The only thing I would change is the wait time for food, but I can't really do anything about that :)</text>

There have been better occasions at this place.

Just ordering to go from socal wings and I'm a bit disappointed.  Their wet popcorn chicken was actually a bit dry. So unfortunate.

Also, they no longer offer free dipping sauces which is a complete bummer. You can buy the sauce for 50 cents each.

I'd stay away from the lychee lemonade. The small is crazily priced at $2.99. Also very disappointing. Too syrupy and sweet and thick. Just a confusing drink. The flavors don't really go together well in this drink.

Despite all the negative aspects, three stars bc the price and quantity is good. You get a lot of chicken in the small popcorn chicken for a reasonable 2.99. The flavors are good. I recommend mango madness. Finally, customer service is pretty nice, which is redeeming.</text>

I will definitely continue business here because they have established themselves with quality service. I am confident in the work they did with my delicate garments. Thank you!<//text>< Pictures>

So I asked for a quote I couldn't figure out how to send them a picture of the dress so they gave me their number I sent the picture and today I spoke to them and I guess it never went through and they never received the picture so I thought they had ignored my text but it was a misunderstanding so I humbly apologize to this company and I am going to try their services out before I can give any other type of review but I wanted to apologize for the misunderstanding on here.<//Text>

<text>The rude worker here (female) got an attitude problem. Before she try to fix someone clothes up, she need to fix her attitude.  I'm surprised no one had slap her yet. Went in to see if they could dry clean my jeans & she gave me rude reply. Don't pay your money to service who has a mental issue ya . Go find a better spot. People who loves there job deserves services from loyal customers!<//text><response>None</response><rating>1<//rating><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

I had my daughter's flower girl dress hemmed up here. The work was neat and done on time. I thought it was a little pricey for a hem and we had to wait a long time for her to be measured, but the staff was friendly and the work was well done.</Text>

<Gmap_id>0x80900c5c9ac5cdfb:0x3bcf3d65ea7be6f0<//Gmap_id><text>My first bad experience was when I had the sleeves of my suit altered for an interview that was out of town. I didn't have time to try it on beforehand. The morning of the interviewed I discovered they shortened one sleeve an inch or so more than the other. It was very noticeable and it was embarrassing to go into an interview. I brought it back and they fixed it same day.

The next negative experience (I will not give them a third chance)  was I dropped off 3 shirts to be cleaned and 3 pants to be hemmed on Monday. They asked what day I would like to pick them up. Thursday being Thanksgiving I said Friday, and that is what they wrote on the receipt. I show up Friday afternoon to discover they will not be open until the following Monday....and hence the negative review.< /text><date>1543014132754<//date><resp>None<//resp>< user_name>

First class cleaners. Although, $5 to dry clean a t-shirt seemed a little expensive.</Review>

I had My all white Puff jacket cleaned previously at Park Wood Cleaners and I settled when they not only didn't get my makeup stain out but made it bigger. Over time my jacket had got a little bit dirty around the wrist and elbows. So I take it in to Swain Rd Cleaners based on reviews I read. Boy am I glad I did. My jacket looks like I just bought it. They even got the stain out that park wood cleaners created. And not to mention their customer service. I will definitely be a returning customer, I'm still in disbelief how good my jacket looks! Thank you!<//Review>

Honest, helpful, best price I could find.
I have a 30 yr old van that was struggling to pass smog. The owner was extremely helpful through the whole process and rechecked my vehicle until it passed. I can’t recommend him enough.<//text>

<text>Ok there is a lot of weird stuff going on with smog places.... I don't understand, but I have ran into a bunch of strange things.  This guy is honest does not charge you unnecessarily etc. I could go on and on.... but this is the only guy I done business with in the smog business that I trust.

A little hard to spot, but easy once you know he's on the back side of the Shell station.  Nice guy, good prices, honest service, and he was very helpful when my car sprang a coolant leak during the test.  I took it back after fixing the leak and received more good service.  Highly recommended.</review>

He didn’t complain at all and told me my car looked perfect and well taken care of for its age!

If you care enough to compare prices you will be happily surprised.  There are lots of good reviews on Yelp if you want to see more.

Like the other reviews said, it was quick and easy. It also cost me $73 for a smog check.  He literally worked on my car for less than 5 minutes and charged me $65 for labor! I could have gotten 2 cars smoged for that price. Rip off! Another car service ripping off the average customer.<//review>

Cheaper than other places. Smog test took 10 min from the time I pulled up to the time I left.  Didn't even have enough time to sit down and check my emails and my vehicle was done. Nice guy, owns the shop and does the work.</Text>

<Review>Good burger, seemed like way more bun, and less meat and toppings that what I remember from pre-pandemic. But who knows it could have been me remembering incorrectly.
Very pleasant staff.</Review>< pics>

<Review>Delicious burgers, but slow service...especially when you sit outside. We waited a long time for our drink and fry refills. No fries to enjoy with the yummy burger, and no drinks to wash it down with :(

I suggest the digital table side kiosks include an option for waiter service (especially for outside dining). The only real options on there is buy more food. But we just wanted fries and our lemonades refilled. What’s the point of bottomless if no service?

All that aside, the burgers are still delicious. I loved my tavern burger with fried onions. And hubby inhaled his burning love burger. Mmmm!</Review>< Pics>

It was good never disappointed with food.  About a 30 min wait for 6 not bad.  Only thing our waitress only came around twice,  other staff helped us.  We had to ask for napkins, sauce, and a fork for the salad ( how do you forget the fork). Overall it was good.<//Text>

Ordered the black n blue with no pink and no onions plus mustard and an avocobb salad with ranch, and coke. They were on time but forgot the coke. When we got back to our hotel, no fork or dressing for the salad. The burger was rare and full of mushrooms, no mustard. Why bother asking how we want the food cooked if you aren't going to read it? Horrible experience. Shame on you for ruining what should have been a decent meal. God knows I paid enough for it</text><response>None</response><rate>1</rate></record></dataset><record>
<Review>Red Robin's a good place to go the staff is doing their best with the covet stuff and running around.

There's maybe two problems I have which is none of their control at this point of time

1. I try to order online and I can't do that I have to call in.

2. I have a rude customer jumped the line while I was waiting to get help.

The staff is very nice fast friendly service can't go wrong Just don't let any rude customers give you a bad day</Review>< Pictures>

Obviously, as a GrubHub driver, I am privy to and receive a certain amount of respect and kindness shown to me by all restaurant employees. After all, we are colleagues and friends.

As for Red Robin in Roseville, California, I can tell you that a young lady named Kayla has shown me and our GrubHub customers a great deal of respect and kindness and assertiveness in making sure that each order is prepared correctly.

Believe me when I tell you that that is not where the service stops. Kindness and the art of loving and inclusiveness Has No Limitation.

So if you want to enjoy one America’s best burgers prepared in one of America’s best restaurants and served to you by one of the best servers in Roseville, California, go to Red Robin.

Ask for Kayla.

And let her present you with not just the best and most enjoyable night out, But one of the most heartfelt evenings you have ever experienced in your life.

I have to wonder how I could possibly be the kind of person that could know these beautiful human beings and call them friends.

And though I feel unworthy, you should present as if you are. Because You are...

Light and Love to You, dear friends.

Kayla, Sweetie darling, You are the bomb.</Review>

Not very good service at all, waited for my burger and they brought me 3 different ones until they got it right... wasn't even hungry by the time it got to me finally an hour later so I didn't even eat it and they didn't even take it off of my bill!!! Not a good crew at all unfortunately won't be going back to this location because of the bad service.< /review>

Food was awesome. My waiter who took my order and packed it up for me was Amazing! She was so upbeat and naturally casual (genuinely too) and so very nice.  It's really nice to go into a place and the employees are excited & happy to see that you came in to thier place. Nice change! 😁< /Text>

Outstanding food. I usually get the keep it simple buyer just because that’s the kind of guy I am, but I have heard great things about all of their food. I highly recommend the “Mountain High Mud Pie” it is amazingly addicting and is a must eat. They have bottomless drinks and fries. Thank you so much for the amazing food!!< /review>

< Review>
The restaurant was not busy 4 customers.  Ordered our food at the table outside the front entrance and was told it would be brought to our car. We waited an hour . I finally went to find the waitress and saw our food sitting on the table inside. The waitress finaly acknowledged me and gave me our food.  Went to the car to eat and everything was cold. This was absolutely unacceptable.  I took the food back and asked for a refund.  This is really sad when restaurants are wanting business to stay open and provide service like this, we will never return to that Red Robin in Roseville again.</Review>

Great experience. The amount of customers  were way less than they used to have but that's to be expected  with things opening back up. All of the staff were great. Chris J was our server and he was on top of it. He made sure we had refills on drinks fries and sauces at all times. When we had questions on the menu he was able to help and even helped with options when he was told what we like. He was  making milkshakes for other servers in between  checking on his tables. The food was great. Definitely love coming here and will continue  to go back.</text>

<name>Carly Moran< /name><review>An excellent dining experience, largely due to our excellent server. Unfortunately I cannot remember her name, but she had darker hair and bright green eyes, and worked on a Tuesday evening. She was incredibly friendly and checked in with perfect timing to give us drink refills and to see how we were doing. The food of course was wonderful as well. I am a light eater, so normally I do not finish my food, but I did this time, so that goes to show how delicious it was. My partner and I truly enjoyed our time here.</review>< Response>

<review>The help was very rude,  VERY.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.  They were very disrespectful. I wouldn't recommend this place to veterans,  the over 60 people, red hat women,  or the disabled.  I am disabled.  They don't have management that is ethical to all, let alone  Christian values. Christians don't believe in false witness,  and overbearing attitudes. They need to read Corinthians, love doesn't demand it's own way.  Tomorrow others with love and kindness.</review>< name>

Used to be great pre-COVID, but the delivery is often missing Items I requested.  They even missed two items for our sons birthday meal and did not even seem to care.</Review>

The food was pretty darn good. However, for me personally, cleanliness of a restaurant is very important. If you look closely at this restaurant it's dirty. The women's bathrooms were gross. You can tell that they are not cleaned well. The doors are red and yet around the locks and all the way down it is black. The walls are dirty, the wooden mini blinds are disgusting and it's just overall a very dirty place. Kind of makes you wonder what the kitchen looks like.</Review>

Service was very good, the waitress passed by every few minutes to ask if there is anything else she could do for me.< /review>< pics>

Some what clean. Seating did not make sense. They have barriers up between booths, but they were dirty and when they seat you side by side booth there is no protection. Fries were over done.<//Review>

If you have food allergies this is the place to go for a really good restaurant burger. Their web site has a allergen menu where you check off what you cant eat and they give you options on what's on the menu you can have. Also shows ways you can have menu items by removing what your allergic to. I had the big taco tavern burger on a gluten free bun with no cheese or sliced peppers with a side salad. I usually get the steamed broccoli which is also bottomless. Love coming here, we've always had great service from the wait staff.< /text>

Good food and service.  They'll provide you with a tablet listing the nutritional information on everything they offer, if you ask. They'll also put your beverage in a to go cup and top it up at no extra charge.</Review>

What can I say for a place that touts burgers and brews I can give it 5 🌟 for the burgers and leave it at that. Also excellent is the fact that they have a good number of bottomless sides many of which are free with the burgers. The beer selection is very limited and very pedestrian, this place is for young families more than craft beer people.< /Text>

I really wanted to compliment the staff at this restaurant. All we were served by greeted with smiles, laughter, and genuine interest in helping us get fed. Food was actually abnormally greater than usual! I walked away from this place a well-pleased man!< /review>

Good service, good food. Not the best I've ever had but good quality and plentiful. Really enjoyed the Pina colada style (alcohol free) drink. Bottomless fries were a plus.< /text>

Catering Review:
I work for Toyota and I ordered the burger bar, salads, cookies, and other sides from Red Robins catering menu for our training event. We had lunch for 75 people 3 days in a row, all catered and delivered by Red Robin. We had a great experience each and every day from their team. The burger bar came with tons of fresh toppings and sauces, making it customizable and different each day. The salads were fresh, and cookies were a hit. The best part was that the Red Robin team was early each day, friendly, and stuck around to help set up the lunch for the event. We were more than thrilled with the food and service, and will definitely be using them again.</Text>

<Text>You can always find a reasonable deal and the rewards program is excellent. The best part is that they have gluten free buns so my wife can have a good burger. It’s not fancy but it’s red Robbin, you know what you’re getting and it’s very reasonably priced.</Text>< time>

The food was fine, but the place was filthy! Our table had a nasty, sticky substance on top and crumbs scattered around the table and benches. The floor EVERYWHERE was dirty. I asked for fries to come out early...that didn't happen. We also had to ask for drink refills. It was not busy in there and all of the staff we encountered seemed like they'd rather be ANYWHERE else; the DMV or a root canal, possibly.
The bar is always spotless and the waitstaff in there are wonderful.<//Review><Rating>3</Rating>< response>

<Text>Went there for the birthday burger. Pretty much the only reason I go anymore. Burger looked unappealing when it came out. Grilled onions were barely browned. Bun was soggy and greasy.  Fries tasted stale. Server wasn't super attentive when we wanted our drinks and fries refilled. The electronic device, where you need to pay the bill, looked like it hadn't been wiped down for a month. Felt kinda gross touching the screen through the menus to pay the bill. Wanted a to-go box for the remainder of my GF's burger, but after waiting for our server for a while, we just cut our losses and left.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>Burgers were good.  Love the bottomless salad option, not sure if that is new or not as it had been years since we ate here.  It was really busy so service was a smidge slow, but understandable.  One batch of fries was kind of soggy, but 1 out of 6 isn't so bad, they were probably just rushing to get people food.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x809b21d688876d09:0xe7b3eaee00aba257</GmapID></record>

<review>My husband and I have always enjoyed Red Robin. We recently moved up here to the Roseville area (from Santa Clarita, CA.). We are overjoyed that the Red Robin on Galleria Blvd. is just as wonderful as we were use to in So. Calif. The staff are friendly & prompt, never forgetting what is ordered or needed. The food is always cooked to our liking, servings are hearty & the temperature is appropriate.  Great restaurant! Great place to eat.<//review>< gmapID>

I used to really like Red Robin. But the last few times the food hasnt been great. Those yummy steak fries that are endless were cold and gross. I got the tortilla soup the last time we went and it was filled mostly with a huge chunk of melted cheese and a little soup. My husband didnt enjoy his burger either.< /text>

Our waitress kept coming by which was great, but when we asked for either more (unlimited fries - with at least 12 steak fries in our two baskets) or a refill of our drinks, it was taken care of by someone else. Our hamburgers tasted like it had NO flavor. The hamburger buns were old and stale tasting. When we asked for a box to take our left overs, we were forgotten. Insted, she brings other customers their boxes. She then turns to our table and asks "how is everything", all I could say was " we are still waiting for Bill". The manager when contacted even acted like she didn't want to here about it. Thia is not the first time having a REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE AT THIS LOCATION. I will not be returning back to this location. I'll go to taco bell or McDonald's.</text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Don't go here!  Tried to charge my card at the table then at the waitress stand but their computers were down so nobody's cards would work so I paid cash. Got home and had 3 pending charges, 2 different amounts. Called them and manager Roberto said he found my transaction and would delete charge. Then I got another additional pending charge.  So 4 pending charges totalling $140 are being held on card after I paid cash.  This is ridiculous and makes me think they are being hacked or their system has major flaws or waitress doesn't know how to use system. Asked to speak to store manager  by phone and he's not available for over a week? Really?? Wow! Will keep an eye on my card for charges to disappear and WILL NOT BE GOING BACK HERE. Waiting to hear back from District Manager.</text>< Rating>

Decent food for decent prices. I hate the noise at this chain. We travel a lot, though, and it is nice to have a place where I know that I can find safe, gluten-free food. The gluten-free buns are some of the best that I have had, and I can actually eat the unlimited fries.< /Text>

<Review>Red Robin is always good if you're craving a burger. I love the bonsai burger with there awesome teriyaki sauce and a pineapple slice. Their Royal Robin with an egg is yummy, and you get bottomless fries, and a tower of onion rings. This Red Robin has excellent service, today our server shared in our excitement of purchasing a wedding dress, and even brought the bride to be a sundae with a flag that said congratulations. Come to this restaurant, and request Natashia as your server.</Review>< Rating>

The food is delicious but I sometimes have issues with things I order getting to my table. Seams like with large groups, random items don't actually get ordered and sent to the table. When I've gone with a small group, everything goes fine.< /review>

Food was good. Service was also good.  The one thing we noticed WAY BEFORE we even went inside was how dirty the front door was!! Smeared with funk from dirty hands and soda. There was a sticky Spot that you had to pry your foot off before you walked in.  Other than that,  it was okay.<//text>

Red Robin is not as good as they used to be. The bottomless fries aren't really bottomless, we asked for more it took till half way thru our visit to get more. The atmosphere is good here, lots to look at and our waiter was really good.< /Review>

We went in to eat and we were being told we could not have our stroller in the eating area because it is a fire hazard. She proceeded to speak very unkindly and was complaining. The manager came to see what was happening and he said to give us the seats that are stroller accessible. If she would have said there was a wait for the seats with stroller access it would have been alright. Just because we were using our stroller we were discriminated against. If you have a stroller DO NOT GO TO RED ROBIN!! it’s not a family environment!! If I could leave no stars I would!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Rating>1<//Rating><user_name>John “Suhr Real” Campbell<//user_name><Text>Food and service has been going downhill for a while now. This last visit will be my last. I'm convinced that the cooks don't know what they're doing and definitely can't cook an egg correctly, even if their lives depended on it. Our server actually had to go back to the kitchen to cook the egg that goes on the Royal Burger. I'll post a picture of the egg that actually came on my burger and believe it or not, this one wasn't the worst one I've gotten. It's sad to see the downfall of this establishment because I used to love going there and the food was very good, but something is now terribly wrong with this restaurant chain. It will probably be out of business soon.</Text>< gmap_id>

It was great. 11 of us and our waiter and server Pablo was on point. Catered to our every need. When the grandkids and nieces nephew visit this is where were going. The burgers are good too.

Food was good. I docked two stars because service wasn't the best. Our server never offered refills on our bottomless fries or drinks. We asked for boxes and it took them quite a while to come. Opted to get dessert elsewhere, and paid using the machine on the table so we could finally leave.<//Text>

<resp>None< /resp><text>The burgers are always excellent as is their selection. I like that they offer an egg as a burger topping as it is one of my favorite burger toppings but it is hard to find a burger place that offers it. The only reason I can't give them 5 stars is that it is near impossible to get a refill on your fries here. I usually ask for an extra basket when the food is brought to the table and it still takes 20-30 minutes to get a simple refill of fries. Bottomless steak fries are a staple of Red Robin's but for some reason, at this location, it is always like pulling teeth to get your fry refill.</text>< gmap_id>

<review>First time eating at this location.  They didn’t have the impossible burger available.  The Pineapple sprite had nothing pineapple about it.  When asked for a military discount server said “we don’t give discounts our food is already so cheap”.  Funny because is @ a different location we were able to get a military discount and a “Thanks for your service”.  Won’t be going back.</review>< Pictures>

Poor service.  I understand that people can be new, but we had to ask for everything.  Only good thing of the night was the 2 appetizers we ordered and the 2 kids meals..  The burger I ordered was cold, nasty and tasteless.  Waitress seemed put out when I told her I ordered the chips instead of fries.  As for the bottomless side item.  Forget it.   Wasted $71< /text>

<review>I've come here multiple times and every time I'm highly dissatisfied withh the service and the food. Today I came because that's what everyone wanted but it was definitely the last time. I'm completely done with Red Robin and the horrible "service" that was given. The food is definitely not worth the money. The fries are okay but it would be great if you didnt have to wait 20 minutes to get more on these so called "bottomless" fries.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Plenty of good burger places out there to choose from.<//review></record>

Good food . Went for my birthday couldn’t get my free birthday burger . Kinda has a ridiculous process to get it . . So because of that didn’t get my birthday burger as advertised. They have a process to get it but they do a horrible job to show that . Then they tell you after the fact . Witch is irritating ( Guess just showing your ID like Denny’s is too hard )

Also was very stingy with bottomless anything. With the initial dishes we barely got fries and when we asked for more ( after doing everything to get our waiter to get to our table ) they barely gave us fries . You could literally count the fries with one hand and still have fingers left over. And they didn’t even bother with our drinks . They never were around enough to even ask . Plus they Got my burger wrong to the point I didn’t care anymore.

It’s just irritating especially I was just trying to enjoy my birthday. Overall good food . Service and birthday policy could improve and be less stingy with bottomless anything.< /Text>

Sara is an amazing server. She pretty much knows what we order and is super friendly and upbeat. The only problem we had this time was a grilled cheese sandwhich was burned and it tasted that way. The rest of our meals were on point.  Hopefully mext time we come in, all our food will be on point.<//Text>

<Text>Food was good.  Staff was pleasant but the place was a mess.  Friday for lunch and we got there at noon.  The place had been open for one hour.  The restroom looked dirty.  Floors were dirty.  Counters wet.  No seat covers in one of the stalls.  We saw a menu on the floor of the restaurant and saw various staff members walk over it multiple times.  Same with a children's place mat.  Finally a patron picked that up while wrinkling her nose.  As I said, the staff seemed pleasant but detached.  Like maybe that wasn't in their job description.  Just a weird experience.  Not awful just not enjoyable.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

service was questionable until Savage stepped in!!! She cleaned off a table for us, sat us, then waited on us. Even had the kitchen make us fries while she got our order! She made this visit amazing! Friendly, funny and honest. She's the reason we'll go back to this one.< /Review>

<Text>Most of the staff is friendly. Food is decent. Managers seem to just let the restaurant drown when it gets busy.
I feel for many of the servers and especially the hosts needing to handle to go and the front with no manager in sight ever!<//Text>< rate>

Food was good but the waitress kept asking if I needed help with the on table kiosk.  Once maybe, but 5 separate times? We were trying to relax at little and have a bit of family time. Kind of felt like she was trying to rush us out.< /Text>

I left my camera there when I was in the area for the weekend. They quickly sent it to me within days. THANKS to their Management staff for getting this done quickly. The service when I was there was also EXCELLENT. Great service is one of the reasons why people come back. Will eat there again whenever I come to visit in the future.</Text>

Would not even give it a 1 star. The last few times we have been here,  they say bottomless fries but you get a half a$$ed full little basket of fries and no one shows up again to refill anything. Its a total gimmick.
Bad service too. Hit your light and no one shows up but passes right by and ignores it. 😕<//Review>

The food was fantastic, our waitress Melody was amazing, polite and on top of everything.

The manager was very snippy when I pointed out the price on the menu was less than I was charged. I had to push her to make up the difference.</review>

<Review>Great big hamburgers, I never go away hungry. The restaurant used to have a lot more decorations, posters and memorabilia on the walls before they redecorated it while back. The new remodel isn't much to brag about. I eat here with my son at least four times a year for the last 15 years. They used to bring out good portions of fries and keep them coming. Now it takes more time to get a refill on your endless french fries and the portions are much smaller. So if you like their fries, ask for them early and often.<//Review><userid>100593658294636441819<//userid>< rate>

<text>Me and my wife were seated and waited 30 minutes, no waiter so I walked up and said we need a waiter. Waiter came 5 mins later. Took our order. Didn't even ask how we liked our burger cooked (pink or no pink). While others who came in only 10 mins got their their drinks and their bottomless fries. He didn't even bring us fries. Then brought our burgers over cooked and dry. Fries were over cooked too. Not only was the service bad but so was the food. Jon was our server.< /text>< GmapID>

The food was fantastic, our waitress Melody was amazing, polite and on top of everything.

The manager was very snippy when I pointed out the price on the menu was less than I was charged. I had to push her to make up the difference.</text>

Great big hamburgers, I never go away hungry. The restaurant used to have a lot more decorations, posters and memorabilia on the walls before they redecorated it while back. The new remodel isn't much to brag about. I eat here with my son at least four times a year for the last 15 years. They used to bring out good portions of fries and keep them coming. Now it takes more time to get a refill on your endless french fries and the portions are much smaller. So if you like their fries, ask for them early and often.< /text>

We’re visiting Beale AFB and ventured out to Roseville for some lunch and had a great experience at this lovation today. Our server Lauren was so friendly and such a great server, we sat in the bar and ordered a couple of appetizers and drinks to start off with and just wanted to sit and relax and she was checking on us just enough! Not intrusive and not slacking either. Our food was tasty and our entrees were HOT AND FRESH. The rewards stuff was down in their ziosk system so Lauren went out of her way to print our receipt and highlight what we could do to make sure we still get our points on our account. She was great, thank you for making our first trip to Roseville a friendly one Lauren! Hope to see you again once we move here later this year :) keep up the great work!<//Review>

Only reason we go back is because we have free birthday burgers. With knowing it was my son's birthday and we used his free birthday burger on him they still didn't offer to sing nor did they give him a scoop of ice cream yet everyone else got that. Everytime we go here something is wrong and or we have to wait a long time for something simple like extra napkins, I finally just get them myself.< /Text>

Depending in the server will depend on your visit, most of the time we get a pretty good table and server but this last visit wasnt super great, our server didnt pay a lot of attention to us and helped other larger parties.

So, came tonight because my kids love coming here. We typically drive past the Lincoln location and go to roseville though because the service here is traditionally poor. Tonight was no different. It took 10 min for our server to even come to the table. We were brought o-rings with no plates. Apparently they were out. We asked for plates again a few minutes later and were told the appetizer plates were being cleaned. We asked for any plate they had and were told they had none. My kids shared the plate the utensils came out on to be able to start eating. Food was brought out ok, they magically had an extra plate for my kids that were sharing. We were out of drinks for the full meal, no refills were ever offered. We had to ask twice for our refills of the Mac n cheese. We come expecting not so great service and tonight met our expectations. We will continue to drive past here.< /text>

Food tasted good but took almost an hour to get. And forget about endless fries, only had about 7 fries on the plate and was finally brought a small plate refill for 4 people when we were paying. Not a good experience.< /review>

Won't be going back. Took awhile to be seated just because they only had one waiter. We only know why because we overheard. They left us sitting in the lobby of an almost dead restaurant with a 5yo with no updates. Then the lobby was super dark, too dark to color the kids menu. Chicken was unseasoned. Kept having to ask for more "botomless" fries. Asked for ranch at beginning of meal, reminded them twice during meal, finally got it after we were done eating. They had baloons for kids but didn't offer us one, so it wad more of a tease.< /Review>

Ate at the Roseville location with my daughter and it was fantastic. It was busy but we still got in quick. They served me a free gourmet burger which was fantastic. One of the best I have ever had. I got it free because they served it to Veterans for free, lunch, dinner. Thank you Red Robin!!! We will be back!!!<//text>

Love the bottomless fries, atmoshere, service and burgers!  The only thing that makes me not give it 5 stars is the strange after taste things have..especially the fries..Can't figure out what it is..MSG maybe? But it's so strong it's the only thing I think of when I think of Red Robin now.<//Text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>Love the food, but the service can be "hit or miss."  If there is a problem with the service, it's usually that our server doesn't come around.  The food is typically prepared correctly, but the server may not come around to refill drinks or fix any issue with the food until the food is cold or gone.

I will say, though, that many times when management has been informed of an issue, they've always come by to make things right.  This poor service we've received definitely isn't a reflection on the entire waitstaff.< /review>< pictures>

<text>Red Robin burgers are great. The service at this location has been consistently low quality, inattentive, and sometimes rude, well below what you would expect from sit-down burger place. On my last visit I spoke with a manager and shared my concerns. His response didn't contain an apology or any incentive for me to return to this location.< /text><Rating>1</Rating>< username>

Good food, but crazy busy, always. The servers are great, food is proportional to the cost, but tables are typically a bit dirty. As a general rule, I tend to not wait 30 minutes to be sat for a burger and a beer. If you want food quickly, not a good place.< /Text>

Won't be going back. Took awhile to be seated just because they only had one waiter. We only know why because we overheard. They left us sitting in the lobby of an almost dead restaurant with a 5yo with no updates. Then the lobby was super dark, too dark to color the kids menu. Chicken was unseasoned. Kept having to ask for more "botomless" fries. Asked for ranch at beginning of meal, reminded them twice during meal, finally got it after we were done eating. They had baloons for kids but didn't offer us one, so it wad more of a tease.< /text>

If I can give this RED ROBIN in Roseville Ca a BIG ZERO STAR i will. The WORST SERVICE!!!!!
We got there, order our food.. waited almost an hour still no food.. our server didn’t come back to check on us or let us know what was going on with our order, instead he sent his fellow lady co worker that works in the “bar” she said to explain that our order somewhat did not show up on their system and blame the computer! Really?
But people that order after us got their food.
Umm ok..
And then a “manager” came in his name Jorge (HORHE)
“Trying” to apologize again, and this time he blames it on how they gotten busy and our order was not put in in their system/computer. It is not an excuse to blame the “their busy” when clearly people that order after us got their food. And they weren’t busy AT ALL. I will NEVER come back and I REFUSE to give red robin my money. JUST CLOSED THIS LOCATION. Period!
This red robin needs more training when it comes to their SERVICE, because they are lacking on that department. They also need to know how to handle this kind of situation. Worst red robin i’ve been to. I will be calling corporate, this is unacceptable.< /Review>

The service at this location has been consistently low quality, inattentive, and sometimes rude, well below what you would expect from sit-down burger place. On my last visit I spoke with a manager and shared my concerns. His response didn't contain an apology or any incentive for me to return to this location.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x809b21d688876d09:0xe7b3eaee00aba257</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Burning Love Burger. Among the various gourmet burgers they have, this one is my favorite. I've been coming to this specific Red Robin for nine years now, and they make a killer sandwich!</review>

Good food but garbage service. Last time i went here I had to get up and refill my own soda. I was watching the waitor goofing off in the kitchen with his co-worker and not refilling our fries or drink. I decided to give it another chance today.  My girlfriend and I just left the restaurant because we were seated for 15-20 mins and no one came to take our order. Never will go to this red robin again unless it gets new management.<//Review>

<review>The food was good, but the service was entirely mediocre. The waitress didn't check in on us, we had to ask twice for fries, they weren't refilled after we finally received and ate them, I had to go up front to ask a manager for a box to go, and this happened when the were only handful of patrons eating.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><username>OriGamei</username><Rate>3< /Rate><time>1555628414411</time>< user_id>

The place advertise bottomless fries. So your craving for fries and place offers bottomless fries. That what your expecting, right. Well they dont serve a basket anymore. They give a handfull on this square plate with your hamburger. Dont get me started with the hamburger. Anyway, so i ask can i have more fries.The employee retreive me , it was a basket, and i counted ten fries . So left the place with a fry craving. Had to go to Mc Ds for a large fry! Star minus in my book!!< /text>

Service was okay. Problem was with Roseville location is that the place was filthy.  To the point we almost walked out after sitting down. Blinds looked like never dusted, table, touch panel looked like they were cleaned with dirty, greasy rags.
Apparently after telling some friends the story,  they all agreed having similiar experiences at this location. Close the restaurant and send a cleaming team in! My daughter loves Red Robin, we will avoid Roseville location though unless cleaned up!</text>

I visited here during my lunch break before and didn't have any problems with service. Until I tried it a second time recently. There was no wait and we got seated right away. Unfortunately the spot they sat us at was right under a strong vent that was blasting us with cold air. We sat and waited for 10 minutes before we eventually got up and left. No one even bothered to come and take our order or ask if we needed drinks. We ended up having lunch at Blast 825. I haven't been back here since then.</review>

<Rate>2< /Rate><review>I've gone here for years and the servive and food used to be top notch. The last 2 years have been hit or miss with the food quality but usually horrible service. Tonight the fries were overcooked, the burgers were decent and the seevice was just OK. We had 2 different waitresses and the 1st was attentive until our food came. Neither one made sure we had utensils or napkins and I had to wait 20 minutes to get those. I hate leaving bad reviews but Red Robin really needs to get their act together and train their staff to higher standards.</review><Time>1504414078759<//Time><userid>101044526259799730722</userid><Name>The RusticHippie Witch< /Name>< Pics>

They actually charged us for another table and then charged us twice on top of that! The manager tried to solve the major problem by throwing gift cards at us. Avoid this place and eat at one of the 10 competing burger places in town that deserve your hard earned money.</Review>< pics>

Mediocre at best. Took our order for drinks and appetizers and forgot to put it in. By the time they realized it our food was going to be out shortly. Then we asked for the corn dogs kids meal (9) for our kids to split along with another basket of fries, and sure enough they forgot the fries. Write it down, if you cant remember it.< /Review>

<Text>This review is for the dining out customers. Ordering lunch here is a nightmare, the orders are always incorrect. This not a single occurrence either. This happens every single time. Attention to detail isn't too much to ask for. I understand multiple orders does cause confusion, but everyone is no excuse. Very unsatisfied and disappointed.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

< review>
Well don't call the curbside number for them to bring your food out unless you want to be forgotten about and your food to be cold. I usually never use the number for the curbside pick up, but today I wasn't feeling well and decided to try it (I usually just go in and get my food). Well today I called and they said they would bring my food out. I sat an waited for awhile and just figured my food wasn't done yet. After about 20 minutes I went inside and my order was just sitting in a basket. Needless to say im super unhappy and my food wasn't even warm anymore and they also messed up my order and i didnt realize it till i got home. if it wasn't for the waiter being super nice in would have given 1 star not 2. Also if it was busy I would have understood, but the place wasn't....< /review>

Pretty good Red Robin. Food has been consistent with usually friendly and fast service. Can be a wait though.<//review>

Just OK at this location. When food was served, my hamburger was a little cold, and the meat was dry, I've had better, Red Robin is not the same as it use yo be. I was a little disappointed in the quality of the food this time.<//Review>

Granted I'm leaving this review six months after the fact... My family and I all got severely sick after eating here. Not only was our food cold when it came out to us, it took an hour to get our orders and our drinks were never refilled. My husband had ordered a hamburger and got hardly any fries with it. I was 5 months pregnant at the time and I got very sick, my two year old son got very ill, and so did my husband. Needless to say we have no intention of every returning to this restaraunt. I've been to several different Red Robin's and have never been very impressed with the food anyway.<//Review>

Food and service was good as usual, just really really expensive for our family for what we got. Close to $70 for 2 adults and 3 kids.</Review>

Red Robin across the street from Roseville Galleria. Always had good service here, full bar, plenty of tables but can get busy during peak times. Also parking sometimes a pain as it's close to Bucca & PF Changs and they all share a parking lot.< /text>

Burgers are good as you would expect. Thier fry policy has suffered. They bring you out approx 8 fries. Then you are stuck waiting for another 8. They are good but it is annoying to have to keep ordering.</Text>

<Rate>3</Rate><text>Food was ok, typical for a chain. They give you 'bottomless fries' but they bring you like 5 at a time. I ordered soup which was OK but was in a bowl just a bit larger than an ashtray. While the food was ok, it's obvious this place is run by corporate America. OK to go to if you're in a hurry and just need to grab a bite, but it's not a destination.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

I hope I just caught them on a bad night... Fridays are very busy in this area.  The wait was long, which I expected, but it took forever for them to take our order, they were out of the pizza my kids wanted, and I never got a refill on my water.  When my burger arrived, it was smaller than the picture looked, and was generally disappointing in taste.  All that said, they were very busy; so I may go there again on a non-Friday night.< /Text>

Worst service ever!  Even though we went right at opening time and there were only 5 tables with customers, our service was horrid!  We asked for ranch with our burgers and "endless" fries.  The ranch was not brought to us before we were done with our fries.  We asked for more fries and never got them!  We had waited for 20 minutes before giving up. I wont be going back :-(<//text>

<Review>We are not that picky but this was terrible service and terrible food. I think Red robin has been sliding backwards for a while in my opinion. We did not have our glasses filled once. We asked for lemons for the water. they never came. We finally had to ask someone else who brought them right over. not going back. Didn't seem to care much.<//Review>< pictures>

Red Robin is a chain so the food doesn't vary much. What I think is ridiculous though is the burgers are about a1/3 smaller than a few years ago and the price has gone up. The quality of the meat and produce has suffered as well. It's all about money not quality.< /Text>

Ordered your onion rings for take out. The gal in the bar who helped was very nice. Gave me what I asked for. 4 pkgs. knife,fork,spoons./w salt & pepper. I wanted salt. I needed the salt. Got my order to the car. I was starving so had a ring. Oh my god. They looked alittle to dark but I was in the car & it was night. But when I took a bite, I thought my teeth would start breaking. They where so 'crunchy' , hard!. And yes , they where very dark. I remember the rings there golden brown /w a soft crunch & tender onion inside.not so done that you could'nt see it! Needless to say I went home & finished the 13 rings. ALOT of the crunch in the bottom of the box /w a small pool of grease. They where still warm to the very last one. How do they do that & still keep the crunch?  Anyway, I will give them another try some day, inside.. with a burger. I'll ask for medium oinon rings.< /review>
