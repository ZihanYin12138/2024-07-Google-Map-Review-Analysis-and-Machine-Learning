Johnny has been our Dewey professional for years and always reaches out by phone the day before. He always asks if we are experiencing any problems.
In the beginning I watched to insure he covered all of the areas of our yard. He always does a fine job, never rushes.< /Text>

<text>Alex was a complete professional, he was informative of what services would be best for our situation and along the way educated us of potential issues that could be a problem later.  I was pleasantly surprised by his work ethic and it was quickly noticeable he had an extensive experience in pest control. This young man's positive energy made the entire process seamless and easy. Thank you so much for making a pesty problem a simple solution!< /text></record>

<review>Just received a refinance Termite Pest Inspection. The Inspector James was on time professional and considerate at all times. He was patient when my daughter wanted to show off her pets and professional while performing the inspection.  I've been with Dewey's affordable Pest Services for over 3 years and James carried the same outstanding quality as Dewey always shows. Thank you James and thank you Dewey!</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

James Weatherby was absolutely wonderful! He was knowledgeable, kind, conscientious, thorough and we talked about the procedure and what he will do to control my squirrel situation. I felt very comfortable and confident that he will make sure I'm serviced properly and efficiently.  Thank you.<//Text>

My technician ALEX is always on time and does a great job each and every time he comes to spray. No issues with any bugs and I would highly recommend him as your tech as well as Dewey as your exterminator company.  Great pricing... Much lower than the competition who wanted to charge us an arm and a leg for the same service! A++++++++++++ Service!!!</review>

<Text>When we first started using Dewey we felt it was a value. They came more often. I believe it was because they came to our house to sell a promotion. But after the promotion we starting paying $90.00 a quarter. They would come out and spray around the outside of the house and yard. This would take them all of ten minutes. I wouldn't see him again for another three months. When I finally asked exactly what we are paying they confirmed their lack of value. $90.00 for three months. They will come out one time, unless you call them to come out again. Now unless you see an onslaught of insects or rodents you probably won't call them, so we are left paying $90.00 for 10 minutes of work. And of course anything like traps is extra. If they came out at least twice a quarter,  that might be a value, but unless you have a serious rodent or insect problem save your money and go to Home Depot and buy a can or raid.</Text>< Pictures>

Have very poor customer service as well as dishonest service technician by the name of David. The technician lied and said he showed up at the service address and that they attempted service. I have cameras around my property and no attempt was made whatsoever. I requested service for a time later than 5pm, but I never received a response.<//Text>

I am a first time homeowner learning things as I go,  I called Dewey Pest Control to come inspect m home, Sunday was my only off day and even though Dewey was closed on Sunday, James still took the time to come out and inspect my home on his day off to accommodate me, he was very kind and professional, on the phone and in person, he even offer to check out the water bug situation.

If you want a professional, respectful and kind pest control company, Dewey is the one.

Thank you James I really appreciate you!<//review>

< Review>
Carol Ardrey Had Dewey Pest control come out and Fernando Benavidez was the employ assigned to exterminate outside the home and he found several wasp nest one extremely big that we were not aware of. He immediately to action and with concern for my dogs Fernando informed us not to allow the dogs in the back for a day. He also made an appoint to come back to re spray while he was still at the home. He was very kind and personable and did his job thoroughly because there was also a wasp nest hidden under a roof shingle we would have never seen. Thank goodness for his work ethic to do a such a great job which gave us peace of mind to know we were taken care of well even my fur babies. Thank you Dewey for hiring Fernando Benavidez an amazing employee.<//Review>

<rating>1</rating><text>I had been with this company since 2012, Technicians are great, however the past 3 - 4  month they stopped sending the technician out on a regular schedule,  I complained each month and was promised the service I requested, but yet every month I had to call to find out when the tech was coming out. Once it had already been 6 weeks since my previous spraying.  This still continued so we canceled services all together.< /text>< pictures>

<review>Today, we were helped by Josh and his service was extremely helpful in finding not only our ant and roach problem, but also in identifying how far they had spread outside of our house. He was very kind and helpful explaining how he was going to help with the problem. He even explained how the chemicals worked and when to expect the problem to dissipate. I would definitely recommend him for anyone looking for help at this company. Thanks Dewey Pest Control!<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<review>The office staff is always polite and professional. I started with them because they're always willing to not only cover the house but also to cover the sheds and when necessary (due to black widows) to cover the wood fence line as well. I have stayed with them for seven years because of the technicians like Fernando. He's knowledgeable, always willing to explain things in an easy to understand way, and down right friendly. I would recommend Dewey to anyone in need of pest control services.</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I have to say we've been very happy with Dewey Pest Control right from the start. I remember the Rep. Brian well... and this was even close to 5 Years ago.. but the reason I'm writing this Today is, the consistent Good Service we get from our Technician, Josh!! He is TOPS in our book!! He was out for a couple weeks last year & while they had a couple nice guys that did good work that did the route... we did miss our Josh! He's good at what he does, Very Knowledgeable & is Extremely personable. We feel Very well taken care of! Thanks Josh for working with us to fit Our needs in texting me when you're 10 minutes out & when you arrive so I can open the gate.

The Office personnel has always been really helpful & nice too.

I DON'T like Bugs & our bug situation when we bought our home drove me crazy!! Since we got Dewey... I can Relax now!! I'm Serious... HUGE Difference! Thanks Dewey... Thanks Josh!! And Dewey.. Please, never take Josh off our route... unless he's ready for a Promotion  of Course.. then we'd understand.<//review>< pictures>

On 3/15/18, I had the pleasure of meeting the Dewey tech for the first time at my sister's house..the tech was polite and provided excellent customer service! Keep up the good work Luis Flores!! My sister's name is Corina Mclellan..

Once again..Luis came out and sprayed my sister's house and did an amazing job! Very thorough and always updates on any changes or if he sees any new bugs!  Thank you Luis for another excellent job. 11/14/2018...

Luis and Corry stopped by this morning...I met Corry for the first time ..spoke to her and was impressed with her customer service skills.  Luis as usual did an excellent job!

Just a couple of days later and we were feeding dry dog food to ants. ☹️  I called Josh and he came back the following day. He tracked the ants to their entrance (under furniture) and immediately took care of the issue. I’m afraid to say it out loud now, but so far, so good. I’m totally impressed with the service Josh provides to us and I would highly recommend him. 🙂< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<text>Very unprofessional!!! They made a appointment with me between 2-4 pm to give me and estimate and spray. He didn’t bother calling and didn’t show up until after 5pm. I waited all day for him to arrive and once he finally showed up Demanded a year contract or $240.00 to spray once and didn’t intended to do it today! I won’t call them again!!!<//text><time>1590625111759</time>< pictures>

<Text>I’ve been with Dewey for a couple years, mostly because I’ve been too preoccupied to change. The first year the technician was amazing. But I feel like they might have got too comfortable and just didn’t care anymore. They’d come and spray quickly—in and out in five-ish minutes. And it didn’t help with the bugs at all. They always came when I wasn’t home, so the inside never got done. I couldn’t remember my technicians name and the one time I called, the receptionist acted like it was a chore to get it for me.

I recently finally switched to Adscot pest control, and when I called Dewey to cancel they told me I needed to give them a thirty day handwritten notice.

Seriously?

They’re good for new customers, but the charm wears off.

**EDIT- I didn’t cancel because I was dissatisfied. I cancelled because I’m moving and decided to go with someone else with my new place.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Name>

Edit: I was contacted by Martin the assistant manager and he was great! he apologized for everything (billing issues, customer service,etc.) he was my tech when I first started up service and he takes my bad experience personal. He made everything right. I received my service and we came up with a better system for billing that worked for both sides. I am now a satisfied customer thanks to Martin! 😊

bad customer service, horrible billing, they want to harrass you for payments but don't care about actually satisfying the customers needs. they cannot work with customers who work Monday thru Friday 8-5 jobs. ( no available weekend appointments ). I used to really like them when I signed up almost 4 years ago but everything has just gone down hill.</Text>

<review>HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Buyers Beware!! We had no pest control issues but when we had a door to door salesman come by we thought we'd be preventative. Their services infested us with ants in our kitchen & pantry. We called them back 4 TIMES to come back & fix the issue. They never could. When we called to cancel their services they said we were part of a contract & had to pay an early cancellation fee. This is almost a year later that we are still dealing with the repercussions from their horrible customer service & exorbitant fees. They told us that our account was taken care of & zeroed out, and now months later we are getting calls from a collection agency. They are incompetent liars & are not worth doing business with.

Luis is friendly,  so polite, and very professional.  I asked if he could spray my laundry room inside even though I didn't call ahead and he said no problem! I highly recommend Dewey Pest Control service.<//review>

Field mice are an issue in this desert. When we had infestation I was given used and very dirty massive New York rat traps. We were then told to seal up any holes around the home. No folks, that's what you get paid to do. Preventative services are not a separate entity. $33 a month for 3 years is enough to get that kind of job done.<//Text>

<text>Gave them a call early on a friday, they told me that I would receive a call before the day ended from a field contractor. Never received the call. Call them back on Monday and they told me again I would receive a call before the day ended, no call. Called them on Tuesday they told me my opp was for Wensday. Still NOBODY shows up so I called back early Thursday morning. They told me the contractor was on his way, I waited till noon no contractor in sight. So I call back and cancelled. Weird thing about all this is that  there's a Dewey contractor who lives on my street. I just called it inn because I never spoken to him and I dont want to bug the man with work while he's at home.< /text><rating>1<//rating>< pictures>

So the guy was supposed to come yesterday but he never showed up, my wife called to find out why he didn't show up they said he called in sick and told us they set another appointment for Thursday then today while I'm at work the pest control guy shows up and starts spraying inside and out while my kids are in the house, my wife told him not to but he insisted and sprayed anyway, she told him that she doesn't have a car because I was at work and he was supposed to come Thursday and he said "no I'm here now and I'm not coming back" so now my kids are complaining of headaches and my baby has hives so now I had to take off work to rush home so I take them to the hospital.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80c365ce6c61293f:0xda0883fc9c05b87a</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE !!
My experience has been bad. My service was never done like it was suppose to. Which included my inside my house,outside perimeter and i paying extra for two shacks in my back yard. But the only job they would get done is my front part of the house,and if lucky the inside .my service that i payed extra for was never done and yet i was still expected to pay the full amount.</review><Resp>None</Resp>< Name>

Now that they came to give their services I find moths in the pantry, little insects inside of our food boxes, cockroaches everywhere and water bugs inside of our beds. This service does not work do not hire them. Im suspicious that they plant eggs instead of kill them.<//Review><Name>Maria Herrera< /Name>< pics>

<Text>bad customer service from the office staff, and twice now we have had the tech show up unannounced without an appointment after telling them we did not want an appointment. the first time, we saw him and turned him away. the second time, he serviced the house (or at least left the hang tag saying he did), while no one was home- after being told we did not want the service!!!!! how can you do this and then say give me money? its like hey i did this service that you DIDNT WANT anymore, and now you owe me money. seriously? i highly DONT recommend this company, even though we had had no previous problems, i dont like being misled out of over a hundred dollars- and they are still showing a balance on my account that i had previously paid!< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Dewey Pest Control is one of the best in the high Desert, one treatment and my ants were gone and if I had any issues like last week seen one water bug come into my kitchen I called Dewey and they sent out a tech the next day ( no more water bugs since) , and their pricing there almost giving it away I could not live in Victorville without Dewey Pest Control and their Top Notch Service.<//Text>< user_id>

They will take out payment without your authorization as long as they have a card on file and then they will continue to deny that they have taken out payment. Even if you never set up for auto-pay! Their customer service is crap all the way from corporate down and their business is not all that great!!!<//Review>< Time>

<Text>Dr David Ghozland and his staff are remarkable! I first started seeing Dr Ghozland a few years ago for hormone replacement therapy… which helped me to feel better and loose weight as I was turning 50… I didn’t return for a visit for a while  due to covid concerns : however, now that offices have re/opened , and  are safe, at least for the double vaccinated ..I cannot wait to get back into see him and update my hormone therapy regime. Dr Ghozland Jr.. and his father , Dr David Sr., are truly responsible and trustworthy doctors. I highly recommend them, for gynecology, obstetrics, and hormone therapy! I am calling them today to schedule my next appointment and get back on track!</Text>< gmapID>

If I could give 0 stars I would. I had a phone consultation and was told the csection release would be $700. I DROVE from El Paso to Santa Monica to just have the the doctor charge $1800 and NO RESULTS. Waste of my time and money. The assistant said she would call me to follow up and here we are almost a month later and she hasn’t even bothered to check on me. NEVER AGAIN< /text>

<text>The best staff and what a friendly doctor Dr. Ghozland is!! I went in to treat my bartholin cyst using his CO2 laser method. Highly recommend!! The success rate is 95% and the cyst will never come back. If it does, Dr. Ghozland will do the procedure again for free. I am so happy and relieved that I will be able to live a normal life again. Thank you so much!!<//text>< pics>

I spoke to Merlyn and from the onset she was courteous and polite and answered a lot of my questions without rushing me off the phone. I set up an appointment to meet Dr. Ghozland and he went over the procedure and answered all my concerns and questions. I have returned for other services since. Setting up an appointment is always easy and the staff has always shown a high level of professionalism and knowledge. My go to person is Merlyn. Her patience and diligence made me feel super comfortable and I trust her hands and expertise. Despite us meeting during the pandemic where the only thing you can see are her eyes, you’ll know exactly who she is when you walk into the office, she’s the one that smiles with her eyes. Love Dr. Ghozland and his staff!!! I Highly recommend you allow your curiosity to take the lead... after all, this pandemic has been a reminder of the importance of self care.<//Text>< resp>

Dr Ghozland is a wonderful doctor. He is very calming and welcoming. He made my prenatal appointments stress free and barely did I ever have to wait long to see him. He delivered my second baby and I am so thankful to have had him as my doctor throughout the entire process.</Text>

I have been with Dr. G for over a decade. I just recently I had a baby and he guided us through the pregnancy and birth with such comfort and ease, it made the transition of pregnancy and birth so rewarding. There was never any judgement in my decisions. He would educate me and guide me through the process and made me feel good and knowledgeable about any decision I made. I even, recently, moved to the East side, and I will bare all the traffic in the world to keep him as my doctor. He has a bedside manner of trust and comfort.< /Text>

So, I came last month for an LP consult and to get a procedure done and all I can say is that I am very happy and satisfied with the results. Dr. Ghozland was great and he answered all of my questions, as well as his nurse Ericka. She was very professional and very helpful at the same time. I am happy with the decision I made, once again thank you.<//Text>

<Review>I been going to Dr Ghozland office for a while now, the office is very nice, I love it there.
I been going in for a certain procedure and I have come to realize that us as women we need to take care of ourselves. They offer so many things. Dr Ghozland takes care of his patients and is not in a rush to get out of the room. Everyone is very helpful and I appreciate them. Merlin the girl in the front is always greeting me and she’s so sweet. I recommend you check out the office and see how great they are.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

He always makes himself available, as a first time expecting mother I have lots of questions and concerns and he always makes me comfortable & has really made this process a pleasure for me. I’m so excited and can’t wait for him to deliver my baby, I would highly recommend him to anybody.

<review>Dr Ghozland is an amazing doctor.  I am fond of his professionalism and his fantastic bedside manners.  I strongly agree with other people are saying that he is the most kindest and caring doctor in LA.  He took time to explain of what to expect after the surgery and how to take a good care of my post surgery at home.  He is wonderful, and my surgery went very successfully by his high-skilled as a surgeon.  His staffs are very nice and very professional too.  There are no words can describe my gratitude to Dr. Ghozland and his team.  He and his staffs went extra miles to provide me the best cares that I needed from a consultation to my post cares. Thank you very much for taking care of me very well.  I am very satisfied.  I will highly recommend my friends to visit you for any help in the future.  Best wishes to you and your practice!!!< /review><Name>Jen Ng< /Name><rate>5</rate>< date>

It is so difficult to change gynecologists but I had to when I moved from Torrance to West Los Angeles.  Dr. Ghozland made the transition so easy and he is the best.  He is comforting, informative and attentive.  I have recommended him to other women who are struggling to find that doctor who really cares.  He is wonderful.  His staff is gracious and professional.  I never have anxiety about making and keeping my appointments.<//text>

Dr. David Ghozland And his staff were very attentive. They made me feel really comfortable and they were really informative. I would recommend him to anyone looking for an OB/GYN or for anything cosmetic. I am very lucky considering that I have had bad experiences with other OB/GYN’s in my past. Thank you Dr. Ghozland For always being available to help.<//review>

<text>Dr. Ghozland was the on call doctor who ended up delivering my first son via c-section. He took such great care of me during my time at the hospital that I switched OB’s immediately following. He and his staff are always so accommodating and friendly. Looking foreword to delivering baby #2 with Dr Ghozland and his wonderful staff!<//text>< UserId.>

David Ghozland MD is an amazing OB/GYN so I would highly recommend him. I had a c-section delivery with him a week ago and he is exactly what I hoped for. I choose him based on reviews after I got pregnant and I'm glad I did. From the first appointment on I knew he is the right MD.
His staff is great as well. They are all very attentive with all the questions, paperwork, appointments, etc.

My OBGYN retired a couple of years ago and I was transferred to Dr. Ghozland.  I will be honest, I was bit hesitant in going but I was sure my prior doctor would not send just anywhere.  He was right! I have been Dr. Ghozland's patient for 2 years and I have no complaints.  He is professional and the staff is friendly and efficient.  Dr. Ghozland will be my OBGYN until he retires!<//review>

Dr. Ghozland and team are beyond awesome. Dr. is super down to earth and made me feel comfortable from the very beginning. He answered every question thoroughly and helped me gain perspective and decide what procedures and tests were best for me. The type of patient care Dr. Ghozland and his staff exude are rare in healthcare today and I feel fortunate to have stumbled upon this gem.<//Review>

On behalf of my mother, I am writing a review for her experience in Dr Ghozland and his practice. She loves the office and is happy with the service she gets when she goes in. She mentioned she had her medication called in right away taken care of by Merlin and made sure she had no issues. Dr Ghozland is very efficient and professional and very nice. This place is a five and beyond!!!!< /Review>

Dr. Ghozland is very kind, respectful and understanding. He carefully listened to my concerns and made me feel confident and relieved from my worst fears. God is using him to help people like me. He gave me hope when all hope was gone. I had huge multiple uterine Fibroids and doctors here had told me that Hysterectomy was the only option i had. Confused and heartbroken, i flew in from Massachusetts and i had a very successful surgery done by him and his wonderful team. I am now on my way to trying IVF. Thank you Doctor Ghozland, you're simply the BEST!!! God bless you!<//Text>

<Review>I greatly appreciate both Dr. Ghozland and his lovely stuff. Both have be great at answering my questions and concerns. During the first consultation I was so nervous I didn’t ask what I originally wanted to. So, I emailed them with my questions and they rescheduled me an appointment where the doctor could answer them all in-person it was such a kind gesture to understand that’s talking about surgery can be intimidating. During the procedure Dr. Ghozland was gentle and quick pace so I was out of there in no time. He did warn that a lot pain will take place on the first couple days but he provided me with extensive instructions on how to cope. The post surgery appointment was no different Dr. Ghozland listen to my concerns and answered them. The stuff was extremely helpful and kind as well throughout the entire experience.

I have  had different procedures done  with Dr. Ghozland , everyone there makes you feel like family they are all extremely professional and kind . Dr Ghozland takes his time with his patients and goes out of his way to make sure you understand what  your options are . He even called me on a Sunday to see how I was doing after my surgery 👍🏼  To me it’s like having a dr on call, he is the best Dr.  now I have my daughter and friends  going to him too .< /Review>

They made my visit throughout my pregnancy so special and enjoyable, plus the office is beautiful, clean and modern. Dr. Ghozland delivered my first baby and supported me and my delivery plan. I could not have asked for a better team the day of delivery that is why I went to him for baby number two. The best doctor to have with you on that day could not have had a natural delivery twice without his support through pushing. Thank you!< /review><date>1499957712315</date><Rate>5</Rate>< Pictures>

<review>In Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5 it said: ״Whoever saves a single life is considered by Scripture to have saved the whole world”.

The meaning is that Dr. Ghozland have saved the whole world with my case at least twice :-)

Thank you will be an understatement as I’m grateful for choosing him as my OB Gyn for the past 7 years with 4 healthy babies and mom.

He is the most caring, human, understanding, sensitive and professional doctor I have ever met!

I will never forget how stressful this journey was and think that I couldn’t choose a better doctor to do it with me.

Regarding his staff, can’t say enough about Emily and Erica which were there for me with anything I needed!

I will recommend Dr. Ghozland and his staff for any women that needs a professional team!<//review>< pics>

Excellent OB/GYN.  Dr. Ghozland performed an open myomectomy to remove fibroids which I had for over 6 years.  I had gotten 2 other opinions where both doctors wanted to perform a hysterectomy which of course I opted not to do.  It wasn't an easy procedure given 4+ pounds as well as 2 different types of fibroids were removed.  Now almost 6 weeks post-op I feel wonderful!!  Thanks Dr. Ghozland and staff :)  You're amazing!!!</Review>

We had previously tried to get our medical records for 2 months with a constant reply of we will have them next week. The California Medial board has a maximum time of 15 days from date of request. After complaining to the Medical board and posting a public complaint we received immediate response along with our records and apologies. We were told there was a change of staff but I would proceed with caution.<//text>

<Date>1500507518302<//Date><Rating>1< /Rating><text>Worst staff I have ever dealt with. No communication with dr as well. No follow up with me after test results. Actually didn't even call me to tell me when the results were in. No idea how my hormone levels are because of this.  Tried twice to make an appointment but never got a return call. Then when came for scripts to be filled it was nearly impossible. I was told they would call it in. 3 days later I'm pulling teeth to get these horrible receptionists, nurses, and Dr to help out. My pharmacy even tried calling them on numerous occasions. Then finally its called in with the wrong milligrams. What in the world are those people doing over there in their fancy office? Absolutely nothing is my guess. And no thank you Dr ghozland, I don't need my vagina rejuvenated. As that is what u tried to sell me on instead of fixing my hormones. As u can see they are a little off....

{'time': 1546897043373, 'text': 'Hi Holly, thank you for the feedback.  We had a special running last week, which is why you were initially told about the $3500 price.  The special is over which is why the price went back to $4500.  However, I would be happy to discuss this with you and offer you our special pricing since you had called in about it last week.  I do not think the one star rating is fair given the circumstances - our staff is very informed and we are all on the same page here.  We would urge you to please reconsider removing this or give us a fair rating that reflects who we are - which is a very compassionate physician and staff who go above and beyond for each and every patient we have.'}< /resp>

Dr. Gozland
Is an excellent cosmetic surgeon. He took his time to answer all my questions before my surgery. He can be professional and funny at the same time. I was also very pleased with his staff especially Violeta. She walked me thru every step. Most of all I'm very pleased with my results. I highly recommend Dr. Gozland if u are considering any cosmetic surgery.</Review>

They tried to cancel my appointment 5 minutes before it started, then ultimately saw me, the appointment felt rushed, parking wasn't validated, they didn't take any steps to fill my birth control prescription with the pharmacy,  they also didn't tell me it was only for 5 months, they couldn't tell me how much I'd pay for the visit, then I ended up paying over $100 for literally a 5 minute conversation.

I'll look elsewhere.</Text><username>Jessica W</username>< rate>

<Response>{'time': 1549643127004, 'text': "Tanya,\nOur staff went above and beyond for you. The issue of your insurance not authorizing your claim, is not the fault of our office staff. Unfortunately what Doctors believe and insurance bureaucracy don't always line up.  We had 3 employees working on this and spent over 8 man hours on the phone with your insurance company and did everything possible to make the outcome favorable for you.    There is an appeal process which we told you about and offered to help you in any way we can but you were not interested in us moving forward with the process.\n\nA one star rating is completely unwarranted.  We strive to provide the best patient satisfaction and do everything possible we can.  Your insurance company denying you a claim - is 100% on them and not us.  We kindly ask you to remove this rating that is not indicative of how we run our practice."}< /Response>< user_name>

Dr David Ghozland and his staff are remarkable! I first started seeing Dr Ghozland a few years ago for hormone replacement therapy… which helped me to feel better and loose weight as I was turning 50… I didn’t return for a visit for a while  due to covid concerns : however, now that offices have re/opened , and  are safe, at least for the double vaccinated ..I cannot wait to get back into see him and update my hormone therapy regime. Dr Ghozland Jr.. and his father , Dr David Sr., are truly responsible and trustworthy doctors. I highly recommend them, for gynecology, obstetrics, and hormone therapy! I am calling them today to schedule my next appointment and get back on track!<//review>

<Text>If I could give 0 stars I would. I had a phone consultation and was told the csection release would be $700. I DROVE from El Paso to Santa Monica to just have the the doctor charge $1800 and NO RESULTS. Waste of my time and money. The assistant said she would call me to follow up and here we are almost a month later and she hasn’t even bothered to check on me. NEVER AGAIN<//Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
The best staff and what a friendly doctor Dr. Ghozland is!! I went in to treat my bartholin cyst using his CO2 laser method. Highly recommend!! The success rate is 95% and the cyst will never come back. If it does, Dr. Ghozland will do the procedure again for free. I am so happy and relieved that I will be able to live a normal life again. Thank you so much!!<//Review>

< Review>
I recently found Dr. Ghozland a few months ago via a google search, I went on his website and decided to let my curiousity get the best of me. I spoke to Merlyn and from the onset she was courteous and polite and answered a lot of my questions without rushing me off the phone. I set up an appointment to meet Dr. Ghozland and he went over the procedure and answered all my concerns and questions. I have returned for other services since. Setting up an appointment is always easy and the staff has always shown a high level of professionalism and knowledge. My go to person is Merlyn. Her patience and diligence made me feel super comfortable and I trust her hands and expertise. Despite us meeting during the pandemic where the only thing you can see are her eyes, you’ll know exactly who she is when you walk into the office, she’s the one that smiles with her eyes. Love Dr. Ghozland and his staff!!! I Highly recommend you allow your curiosity to take the lead... after all, this pandemic has been a reminder of the importance of self care.< /Review>

Went in for a  consultation and the doctor and staff treated me amazing. The doctor made me feel so comfortable and made my discussion so much easier. His nurse Ericka was so polite and nice I felt at home. I have recommended them to all my friends and family. I will definitely be going back.<//Text>

<Review>I have been with Dr. G for over a decade. I just recently I had a baby and he guided us through the pregnancy and birth with such comfort and ease, it made the transition of pregnancy and birth so rewarding. There was never any judgement in my decisions. He would educate me and guide me through the process and made me feel good and knowledgeable about any decision I made. I even, recently, moved to the East side, and I will bare all the traffic in the world to keep him as my doctor. He has a bedside manner of trust and comfort.<//Review><gmapID>0x80c2bb5daa8d2b93:0x61be8a70e1e01a0c<//gmapID>< time>

<Text>I been going to Dr Ghozland office for a while now, the office is very nice, I love it there.
I been going in for a certain procedure and I have come to realize that us as women we need to take care of ourselves. They offer so many things. Dr Ghozland takes care of his patients and is not in a rush to get out of the room. Everyone is very helpful and I appreciate them. Merlin the girl in the front is always greeting me and she’s so sweet. I recommend you check out the office and see how great they are.<//Text><GmapID>0x80c2bb5daa8d2b93:0x61be8a70e1e01a0c</GmapID>< Rating>

< review>
I’ve been coming to Dr. Ghozland for 3 years now and I came long before I ever got pregnant, now I’m 7 months pregnant and so grateful I had the opportunity to see him before and choose him to be my Dr throughout this pregnancy. He’s the best! He always makes himself available, as a first time expecting mother I have lots of questions and concerns and he always makes me comfortable & has really made this process a pleasure for me. I’m so excited and can’t wait for him to deliver my baby, I would highly recommend him to anybody. As a matter of fact I’ve referred quite a few of my friends to him already & they were extremely happy! Dr Ghozland is the best!<//review>

Dr Ghozland is an amazing doctor.  I am fond of his professionalism and his fantastic bedside manners.  I strongly agree with other people are saying that he is the most kindest and caring doctor in LA.  He took time to explain of what to expect after the surgery and how to take a good care of my post surgery at home.  He is wonderful, and my surgery went very successfully by his high-skilled as a surgeon.  His staffs are very nice and very professional too.  There are no words can describe my gratitude to Dr. Ghozland and his team.  He and his staffs went extra miles to provide me the best cares that I needed from a consultation to my post cares. Thank you very much for taking care of me very well.  I am very satisfied.  I will highly recommend my friends to visit you for any help in the future.  Best wishes to you and your practice!!!<//Review>

<text>It is so difficult to change gynecologists but I had to when I moved from Torrance to West Los Angeles.  Dr. Ghozland made the transition so easy and he is the best.  He is comforting, informative and attentive.  I have recommended him to other women who are struggling to find that doctor who really cares.  He is wonderful.  His staff is gracious and professional.

Dr. David Ghozland And his staff were very attentive. They made me feel really comfortable and they were really informative. I would recommend him to anyone looking for an OB/GYN or for anything cosmetic. I am very lucky considering that I have had bad experiences with other OB/GYN’s in my past. Thank you Dr. Ghozland For always being available to help.< /Text>

Dr. Ghozland was the on call doctor who ended up delivering my first son via c-section. He took such great care of me during my time at the hospital that I switched OB’s immediately following. He and his staff are always so accommodating and friendly. Looking foreword to delivering baby #2 with Dr Ghozland and his wonderful staff!<//review>

David Ghozland MD is an amazing OB/GYN so I would highly recommend him. I had a c-section delivery with him a week ago and he is exactly what I hoped for. I choose him based on reviews after I got pregnant and I'm glad I did. From the first appointment on I knew he is the right MD.
His staff is great as well. They are all very attentive with all the questions, paperwork, appointments, etc.

My OBGYN retired a couple of years ago and I was transferred to Dr. Ghozland.  I will be honest, I was bit hesitant in going but I was sure my prior doctor would not send just anywhere.  He was right! I have been Dr. Ghozland's patient for 2 years and I have no complaints.  He is professional and the staff is friendly and efficient.  Dr. Ghozland will be my OBGYN until he retires!< /review>

< review>
Excellent OB/GYN.  Dr. Ghozland performed an open myomectomy to remove fibroids which I had for over 6 years.  I had gotten 2 other opinions where both doctors wanted to perform a hysterectomy which of course I opted not to do.  It wasn't an easy procedure given 4+ pounds as well as 2 different types of fibroids were removed.  Now almost 6 weeks post-op I feel wonderful!!  Thanks Dr. Ghozland and staff :)  You're amazing!!!< /review>

<Text>On behalf of my mother, I am writing a review for her experience in Dr Ghozland and his practice. She loves the office and is happy with the service she gets when she goes in. She mentioned she had her medication called in right away taken care of by Merlin and made sure she had no issues. Dr Ghozland is very efficient and professional and very nice.

<Text>Dr Ghozland office is great and I highly recommend it if you have issues with Bartholin Cyst. When I first went in I was nervous and eventually I was good, that day of the procedure I was greeted and taken care of by Merlin and honestly, She even gave me snack and and was so sweet and helpful. Eventually I calmed down and now everything turned out good and I have to say I love that office. Highly recommend Dr Ghozland and his awesome Staff!!!</Text><Rate>5</Rate><user_id>110113639279693125546</user_id>< time>

Dr. Ghozland is very kind, respectful and understanding. He carefully listened to my concerns and made me feel confident and relieved from my worst fears. God is using him to help people like me. He gave me hope when all hope was gone. I had huge multiple uterine Fibroids and doctors here had told me that Hysterectomy was the only option i had. Confused and heartbroken, i flew in from Massachusetts and i had a very successful surgery done by him and his wonderful team. I am now on my way to trying IVF. Thank you Doctor Ghozland, you're simply the BEST!!! God bless you!<//Review>

<Review>I greatly appreciate both Dr. Ghozland and his lovely stuff. Both have be great at answering my questions and concerns. During the first consultation I was so nervous I didn’t ask what I originally wanted to. So, I emailed them with my questions and they rescheduled me an appointment where the doctor could answer them all in-person it was such a kind gesture to understand that’s talking about surgery can be intimidating. During the procedure Dr. Ghozland was gentle and quick pace so I was out of there in no time. He did warn that a lot pain will take place on the first couple days but he provided me with extensive instructions on how to cope. The post surgery appointment was no different Dr. Ghozland listen to my concerns and answered them. The stuff was extremely helpful and kind as well throughout the entire experience.

I have  had different procedures done  with Dr. Ghozland , everyone there makes you feel like family they are all extremely professional and kind . Dr Ghozland takes his time with his patients and goes out of his way to make sure you understand what  your options are . He even called me on a Sunday to see how I was doing after my surgery 👍🏼  To me it’s like having a dr on call, he is the best Dr.  now I have my daughter and friends  going to him too .< /Review>

<Text>I am so appreciative toward Dr. Ghozland and his staff. They are the greatest. They made my visit throughout my pregnancy so special and enjoyable, plus the office is beautiful, clean and modern. Dr. Ghozland delivered my first baby and supported me and my delivery plan. I could not have asked for a better team the day of delivery that is why I went to him for baby number two. The best doctor to have with you on that day could not have had a natural delivery twice without his support through pushing. Thank you!</Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Text>In Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5 it said: ״Whoever saves a single life is considered by Scripture to have saved the whole world”.

The meaning is that Dr. Ghozland have saved the whole world with my case at least twice :-)

Thank you will be an understatement as I’m grateful for choosing him as my OB Gyn for the past 7 years with 4 healthy babies and mom.

He is the most caring, human, understanding, sensitive and professional doctor I have ever met!

I will never forget how stressful this journey was and think that I couldn’t choose a better doctor to do it with me.

Regarding his staff, can’t say enough about Emily and Erica which were there for me with anything I needed!

I will recommend Dr. Ghozland and his staff for any women that needs a professional team!<//Text><Rating>5</Rating></record>

Excellent OB/GYN.  Dr. Ghozland performed an open myomectomy to remove fibroids which I had for over 6 years.  I had gotten 2 other opinions where both doctors wanted to perform a hysterectomy which of course I opted not to do.  It wasn't an easy procedure given 4+ pounds as well as 2 different types of fibroids were removed.  Now almost 6 weeks post-op I feel wonderful!!  Thanks Dr. Ghozland and staff :)  You're amazing!!!<//Text>

We had previously tried to get our medical records for 2 months with a constant reply of we will have them next week. The California Medial board has a maximum time of 15 days from date of request. After complaining to the Medical board and posting a public complaint we received immediate response along with our records and apologies. We were told there was a change of staff but I would proceed with caution.<//Text>

<text>My OBGYN retired a couple of years ago and I was transferred to Dr. Ghozland.  I will be honest, I was bit hesitant in going but I was sure my prior doctor would not send just anywhere.  He was right! I have been Dr. Ghozland's patient for 2 years and I have no complaints.  He is professional and the staff is friendly and efficient.  Dr. Ghozland will be my OBGYN until he retires!<//text>< Pictures>

Worst staff I have ever dealt with. No communication with dr as well. No follow up with me after test results. Actually didn't even call me to tell me when the results were in. No idea how my hormone levels are because of this.  Tried twice to make an appointment but never got a return call. Then when came for scripts to be filled it was nearly impossible. I was told they would call it in. 3 days later I'm pulling teeth to get these horrible receptionists, nurses, and Dr to help out. My pharmacy even tried calling them on numerous occasions. Then finally its called in with the wrong milligrams. What in the world are those people doing over there in their fancy office? Absolutely nothing is my guess. And no thank you Dr ghozland, I don't need my vagina rejuvenated. As that is what u tried to sell me on instead of fixing my hormones. As u can see they are a little off....
You guys suck!!!!!!!< /text>

{'time': 1546897043373, 'text': 'Hi Holly, thank you for the feedback.  We had a special running last week, which is why you were initially told about the $3500 price.  The special is over which is why the price went back to $4500.  However, I would be happy to discuss this with you and offer you our special pricing since you had called in about it last week.  I do not think the one star rating is fair given the circumstances - our staff is very informed and we are all on the same page here.  We would urge you to please reconsider removing this or give us a fair rating that reflects who we are - which is a very compassionate physician and staff who go above and beyond for each and every patient we have.'}< /Response>

Not a great experience overall. They tried to cancel my appointment 5 minutes before it started, then ultimately saw me, the appointment felt rushed, parking wasn't validated, they didn't take any steps to fill my birth control prescription with the pharmacy,  they also didn't tell me it was only for 5 months, they couldn't tell me how much I'd pay for the visit, then I ended up paying over $100 for literally a 5 minute conversation.

I'll look elsewhere.</review>

<pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1549643127004, 'text': "Tanya,\nOur staff went above and beyond for you. The issue of your insurance not authorizing your claim, is not the fault of our office staff. Unfortunately what Doctors believe and insurance bureaucracy don't always line up.  We had 3 employees working on this and spent over 8 man hours on the phone with your insurance company and did everything possible to make the outcome favorable for you.    There is an appeal process which we told you about and offered to help you in any way we can but you were not interested in us moving forward with the process.\n\nA one star rating is completely unwarranted.  We strive to provide the best patient satisfaction and do everything possible we can.  Your insurance company denying you a claim - is 100% on them and not us.  We kindly ask you to remove this rating that is not indicative of how we run our practice."}</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2bb5daa8d2b93:0x61be8a70e1e01a0c</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The place may be small but the flavor of the chicken is large. This is one of my favorite places to get rotisserie chicken they have large family packs and small lunch packs as well. Their potato salad is the best I have ever tried. The rice is a bit dry but adding some of their spicy salsa adds great flavor. The only problem is that sometimes there's a wait time but it is worth it. Great chicken, great potato salad, great salsa, decent rice.</text>

< review>
This is one of the rotisserie chicken I have tried. The portions are good, their sides taste delicious and the prices are great!!
They even made me use a coupon from another restaurant with a similar name.
They take orders over the phone and your food is ready when they say it will be ready.
If you haven’t tried this place yet, I urge you because you will not regret it.</review>

Hire these guys! Nothing else to say. You want pros that get in, get out, get the job done right, clean up, do exactly what they say, then you want these guys! Dealt with a lot of people doing side jobs. Don’t do it. Half done sloppy jobs not finished . These guys damn! They know their stuff. Very impressive. Love what they did. Love my home now. Nasty 50 year old insulation sucked out and hauled away. Gone! Nice clean neat newly insulated, cracks sealed, rodent proof attic. Thrilled! Half a day and done!< /text>

Ian is a wonderful person to deal with. I needed my entire attic insulated and needed my house rodent proof due to new construction that was going to happen soon. It seemed the bid was a bit high, but when I got two other quotes they were charging more and doing less. That’s when I realized Ian from Atticare was giving me a great deal. I am very happy!
They were very clean and left no mess behind!!< /Text>

<Review>Extremely easy process from start to finish.  Made changes to quote without any issues (twice) and then scheduled an appointment for the work within days of signing the contract.  From the Project Manager to the office staff, to the professional worker representatives, who arrived at 8am and finished at 4:30pm.  They worked the entire day without stop, handled everything on their own (asked for nothing),  left our garage and the attic clean, now with very  thick insulation!  Doing necessary household tasks are never fun and, although this was the most reasonable quote I received, often expensive.  ALL the staff at AtticareUSA made the process as painless as was possible.  Thank you! Great Service!<//Review>< username>

<Review>They provided a much needed upgrade to our older home... finished, insulated and created a ladder to garage attic. Replaced old insulation and whole house fan to roof and cleaned up, rodent proofed, insulated & creates moisture barrier to our crawl space.  We gained a significant amount of square footage of storage  space & now the house is better designed to keep us cool this summer and warm this winter..
Very professional hardworking crew and Francisco was excellent in coordinating the work.<//Review><date>1596472348533</date><gmap_id>0x80857e607057b533:0x8ff548299d149ba3< /gmap_id><Response>None<//Response><rate>5</rate></record></dataset><record>

I was very pleased with the job Atticare did cleaning out my attic, which was full of old blown-in insulation that had been used as rodent bedding for 70 years.  It's now clean as a whistle, and re-insulated perfectly.  The Atticare staff were professional, courteous, and responsive to all my questions.  I'd definitely recommend them.  I live in Newark CA, and was served by their San Francisco/East Bay team.< /Text>

Atticare did a great job of removing my insulation at a good price point and finished the job in a good timeframe. They completely removed my insulation, sanitized and sealed, then put in new insulation up to r38. Will definitely go through them again when its time to finally add insulation to the crawl space.<//text>

Attic care team called in advance to let us know they were coming. They were wearing all the necessary protective equipment while working and provided updates and pictures of the project in progress. Left the house as is before the project. They also fixed the vents by wrapping them which was not part of the project. I haven’t seen any immediate difference yet but looking forward to a cooler 2nd floor.< /review>

He introduce himself as the project manager (no doubt he was, because he answered all my questions). They did a pretty good job at my crawl space removing all the old insulation and taking out the trash, now they installed new insulation and  looks clean and smells good, this is how i know i did the right choice.

First Steven Freitas came on-site for an estimate.
Super energetic and had great recommendations and pricing.

Then Elmer and team (amazing crew of 2) worked super hard for over 5hrs straight!  Team work.  Pulled out over 10 large bags of really old blown insulation.

Thanks AttiCare!!!< /review>

Atticare’s employees did an awesome job replacing the insulation at our home. They arrived early (!) and finished the job by making sure there was no evidence they had been there. Everyone we talked to and worked with were professional and helpful! I can’t say enough good things about Atticare. I highly recommend the company and the people!<//Review>

<review>It’s tough to find a vendor like this these days. The estimator was responsive and knowledgeable, the installers (Denis and his team) were professional, detail orientated and went above and beyond what I was expecting (placing wire mesh over all of my ingress/egress areas to prevent rats from returning - which wasn’t even in the plan) which is why I gave them a 5 star review. I had 3 quotes and they were the cheapest. Highly recommend these guys, and specifically Denis and his crew.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

We had the whole house fan (Quiet Cool Stealth Pro 5.5x) installed recently by Atticare. They gave the best price/quote for the install and also the ones who could install right away. As we were going through a heat wave, we didn't want to wait for several weeks for the install.
The installation was quick. They did a clean job covering up everything including walls so that no dust would settle down anywhere. The whole installation took less than 2hrs.
The fan works great and we turn it on for an hour or two in the morning and also late evening to bring the house to outside temperature quickly.
The fan noise is minimal and you can barely hear it if you are >30ft away. It has a mild humming noise so not at all annoying. Our kids are able to sleep through it.
Overall we are happy with the fan and also the installation.<//review>

My husband and I couldn’t be happier with our decision to select Atticare! The guys were extremely polite, professional, knowledgeable, thorough, clean and tidy. We were super impress with the service they provided. They removed the existing insulation, sanitized the attic, seal all entry points and re-insulated it. Additionally, they seal all entry points around the perimeter of the house, including the crawl space and garage. We highly recommend this Diamond Certified company!</review>

We only had this company clean out existing insulation. They did a great job and the timeframe for the job was around the time it was estimated at. No accidents happened requiring any repairs. Being able to review and sign documents online made the process very easy. I would definitely recommend this company to take care of removing insulation for any homeowner.</text>

<Text>Atticare staff reported to work on time, giving 30-minute advance notice of their arrival.  Preparation for the attic work started with sealing off of the unaffected area with plastic sheets.  The photos were taken before the existing thermal insulation removal work and after new thermal insulation was installed.  The attic space was sealed off for rodent-proof steel wire mesh after existing thermal insulation was removed and before new thermal insulation was installed.  The work started about 8 AM and completed about 3:30 PM for a 1,400 SF attic space.  The foreman was very friendly and explained the work clearly in detail.  Their professional workmanship is highly recommended for their prospective customers.< /Text><Rating>5</Rating><time>1562368081665</time><user_id>104761611425011697339<//user_id><gmap_id>0x80857e607057b533:0x8ff548299d149ba3< /gmap_id></record>

I was most impressed with the use of protective gear   That's the major reason I went with Atticare. The crew did so also. They were on time.; Polite; kept the work area clean; worked hard; and finished the job on time. Thank you😃</text>

Great prices, very courteous and friendly. Installed an attic fan and now the house cools down within a couple of hours. More importantly, on hot days it doesn’t get as hot as it used to. Also, it doesn’t matter if your windows are not facing the breeze direction; the suction power will pull air from all open windows.< /Review>

Atticare provided great service. The crew arrived on-time and was personable. They worked extremely hard to clean out the attic due to a rat issue. They removed the old blown in insulation, sanitized, sealed holes and installed new insulation.< /review>

I hired Atticare to install a "whole-house" or attic fan by Quiet Cool. I considered giving them 2 stars, since the estimate, sale and installation process were smooth, but the actual poor result and lack of successful follow-up to mitigate it are so unsatisfactory that it outweighs that. In sum: I paid $1,600 and have a fan that does nothing. It turns on, but it does not cool the house, at all. When I reported this, they sent out someone who was extremely green, and who multiple times confidently said he'd discovered what was wrong, but it was clear that he didn't understand the most basic aspects of the installation, like the square footage of the house; he also didn't know how the fan worked or how to instruct me to use the fan. I was originally going to get attic insulation at the same time, but did not; one of the things this guy said was that it wouldn't work without insulation, which doesn't make sense, but if it is true, they should have told me that before installing the fan.

So either I got the wrong fan, they installed it incorrectly, they installed it in a non-ideal location for it to work well, or there is another factor or combination of factors (lack of attic vents? insulation? I'm not opening the right combination of windows/doors?). I have run many experiments myself to try to get it to work, to no avail.

Regardless, they have taken zero responsibility for the outcome of their work.</Text>

They guided my landscaper on additional areas to trim.  Spent considerable time in the crawl space under my house.  Very professional and Conscientious.  .Plus  my estimator/salesman, Gil, was very good.< /Review><userid>103758183409568029592</userid><gmapID>0x80857e607057b533:0x8ff548299d149ba3< /gmapID>< name>

Attic Care was extremely responsive and quick. I needed new installation completed within the week and they were able to accommodate due to openings in their schedule.
Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because they routed the vacuum hose through my baby's room. They did hang up plastic wrap all over the room but I did not appreciate that they went through my baby room when I was informed that the hose would go down the hallway.<//Review>

<review>It's just a week since the work was done, but so far everything looks great. The estimate and actual work went just fine.

The only thing I can say is that I wish that Atticare offered a 3-year warranty, like one of the competitors, but Atticare's price was better so I went with them. So far, I'm glad I did.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Atticare came in on a Sunday to give us a bid. No hassle no BS. He came in, took a look at what we have, and went over his bid. Felt like it was a fare deal, so we scheduled. Crew came in 2 days later and installed the installation. Crew was quick, and cleaned up after them selves. The whole experience was good, I would recommend them for any installation needs.</Text>

Don’t usually rate anyone, but so impressed with their professionalism, pricing and most importantly the results.  Attic insulation has kept our house cool, even on the hottest days and reduced our power bill.  Called them back to do a vapor barrier under our condo and there was a noticeable difference in the inside air when they left - no more musty smell.  Highly recommend them<//Review>

After entering into contract and throughout the whole process, all communication with both David and the office went very smoothly. The crew that came out did a great job under Luis's leadership.

< Review>
I found Atticare through a ValPak and I'm glad I did! This review may read as if it is an arranged endorsement but I am a consumer with no other connection to this business. They hit a grand slam with me in terms of price, service, quality, and personnel. Their bid was the best both in price and in the scope of tasks to be completed in terms of clean up, pest exclusion, and insulation. Everything that was needed and nothing that wasn't.  My job was professionally assessed, explained, and the bid was in clear language and delivered in a timely fashion. The information given was thorough and accurate-- no hype and all questions were answered with patience.

The scope of the work completed was as it turns out, well described and more importantly met the requirements of the job, even when it wasn't easy.  The job was done on time and each step was documented in photos so I could see that all elements were performed to my satisfaction. The job site was protected and kept clean and secure. Communication with the foreman was top notch throughout. The quality of workmanship and materials were optimal and most importantly appropriate to my home. Every person employed at Atticare was personable, informative, and professional, whether in the bidding process, job delivery, or office communications.
You would be wise to contact them if you need their services!</Review>

<Review>We re-insulated the attic space in our 45 year old home, and insulated the crawl space for the first time.  We've lived here for 30 years and as we get older find that we are bothered by the cold weather and cold floors more and more. Hoping the crawl space insulation will help.
The crew did a great job, were in and out in one day. The point of contact person, Connor, was always available to answer any questions.  The spray disinfectant left a pretty strong odor that bothered me. Connor assured me it would dissipate soon, which it did within 2 days, but that if it still bothered me by Monday he would come back and try to address it.  They could have used an odor-free spray if I had told him about my sensitivity to scents.
Overall a very positive experience.  I would recommend them.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

< review>
I really enjoyed interacting with the inspector who came out (Milo) and provided me his recommendation and quote. His feedback was reasonable and it was easy talking through options.

This is an expensive service- I paid $5500 for 1500 sq ft attic clean-up, rodent proofing and insulation replacement + crawl space clean-up.

Pros: The crew arrived on time, communicated arrival times in advance and did a good job of setting up the site.

Cons: The sub-contractor who came out to do the job tried to sell me a service on the side (insulating air vent pipes in the attic) claiming it was not covered and it would be cheaper if he did it on the side. I was blindsided since (a) I did not know why that service was not covered to begin with since I thought I opted for full recommended service or if that was omitted because it was not required in my case (and had to call the inspector to clarify) and (b) I do not appreciate the un-professionalism of side jobs and extra payments.

Also, I communicated to the crew-lead that there were 2 entrances to the crawl space and right after I showed him one he said they'd start with attic first. At the end of day when they said they are done with attic and crawl space I went on to check from both crawl space entry and found the area around the second no where near clean. On pointing out the crew mentioned that they must have not had access to this part from the other entrance- I would expect better knowledge and judgment or cross checking - they charged me for the whole space- if they could only clean half from one entry they should know to ask that something seems off. They did a quick job of trying to clean up but did not vacuum and also claimed that had run out of sanitizing liquids.

What I thought was full service was not nearly full service. Apparently cleaning the crawl space does not mean vacuuming. And insulating the attic does not involve insulating air ducts in there. Too many fine prints.

Overall expensive and much needed service but can be better. Has the same pitfalls as any contractor job that sub contracts.
……..……………............

Update:

After I posted the above review the company contacted me and sent out a different sub contractor to finish up properly. This crew pulled out a huge amount of additional debris from my crawl space before they said they were done. I don't have a way to verify if this time indeed the work was left complete however I appreciate the company acting on feedback and making attempts to fix the problems from the first visit.<//review>

First no one likes rats in their attic! We did not know the best way to approach this. After talking with friends, they chose to trap to kill rat but not cleaning up the area.  I always say you get what you paid for. It may of been more money then I wanted to spend but I know it was done right. They put plastic up to the ceilings, sucked up all the insulation,  killed a rat, disinfected, found area that came in through a roof tile, foamed all areas and rolled down new insulation.  They took pictures through the process. I would highly recommend this company. Very satisfied.<//review>

This was the first time I worked with an attic cleaning company so I was somewhat cautious in selecting the right company. My decision to use Atticare  was an excellent one. From start to finish all the employees were helpful and  informed and the final product was way beyond my expectations. The initial representative, Gil, was most helpful and dependable. The work supervisor, Luis, and his two helpers were hard working and speedy. They arrived within the appointment  time window and left with all the debris removed from the attic. The work area was clean and tidy when they left. I had several neighbors ask about them and I had no problem recommending them.< /review>

STOP!!! Don't go any further if you are reading this review you will not need to read anymore about any other that provide this type of service. From Ricardo that came to provide me with the services and their up front pricing to Frandi and his team who did a STELLAR job in the installation process of the insulation... the only thing I wish they included is to covers for the vents.It helps with the encapsulation.
I did lots of research about this unfortunately for health reason as I knew nothing about vapor barriers etc... if you know me you know I went on YouTube .. followed crawl space experts and this guys are legit!!!< /review>

I contacted Atticare for attic inspection and rodent proofing service. The technician/inspector, Michael, came to my house and went on to the attic for a thorough inspection and assessment. He clearly described the details about what he found and patiently answered all my questions. When he worked on the estimate, he explained all the options available and analyzed the pros and cons to me. Based on all the factors and what I prefer, he provided a very reasonable estimate. He is professional, patient, and honest. We're happy with the proposal so we've decided to go for it. Will post update when the project is done.<//review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I worked with Ariel (Manager) and Ricky (group lead) to get my attic cleaned out/re-insulated with R39, radiant barrier installed in garage attic and crawl space rodent-proofed and air ducts re-insulated. Here's why these guys are fantastic:

1. They gave me a fair quote. They were my third and final quote; another company came close, but I liked the honest approach these guys took to providing the quote and list of work to be done.

2. A large crew came in the morning and finished the entire job by evening, despite me adding the radiant barrier work in the garage last minute (which was a big job). They were quick, clean, professional and thorough.

3. Our chandelier came loose while the guys were in our attic because the contractor who installed it previously didn't do it properly. Long story short, the Atticare guys went above and beyond and fixed it, which was not a small job. They then finished their job, on time no less. I was really impressed.

I recommend these guys wholeheartedly.</Text>< Pics>

From the instant reply to my online inquiry to the execution 3 days later, Atticare delivered way past my expectations. I had a skunk sneak into my crawl space and needed a deep clean asap. They replied instantaneously to my online inquiry and sent Corey out the next day for the inspection. Corey was exceptional.  Professional and honest and provided us with a very reasonable and competitive quote. The team arrived on schedule at 8am three days later and did an excellent job! Roy, Sergio, and Miguel were simply amazing. The crawl space was very tight and extremely smelly and Roy and Sergio didn't complain and went right in...Miguel sealed up all the holes in the larger crawl space and cleaned and disinfected all the areas. They were extremely efficient and finished the job much quicker than expected. Corey followed up the next day to ensure we were satisfied. Never experienced such great service from a contractor before and definitely would recommend to my friends and family or anyone that needs their services..Corey, Roy, Sergio, Miguel...thank you so much! Really appreciate the efforts

FOLLOW-UP REVIEW 12/17/19:
I needed to follow-up on my initial review with another 5 star rating. Atticare guarantees their service for 1 year and they are true to their word. I had to schedule a couple more follow-up visits as the skunks were relentless and breached my crawl space. Each visit the technicians were extremely thorough and deployed all preventive measures. The very last visit (fingers crossed!, Skunks are ruthless!) Roy came out again and his crew (Valentin, Francisco, and Carlos M) double checked the whole house, cleaned up the war zone in my crawl space and sealed up all the holes caused my the skunks. It was horrible down there but the team had zero complaints and made sure that they cleaned out every single dropping and deep sanitized the whole area. I'm extremely grateful and impressed with the level of service and positive attitude expressed from the team as well as the customer service I received when I phoned in the problems and to schedule appointments. Thank you again guys for restoring our home and really thankful for all your hardwork and professionalism..< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

The project manager was very conscientious and detailed oriented, but without exaggeration, Ricardo is absolutely the best. He was able to identify the issue and ensure all holes were sealed before leaving. He also gave us tips on how to keep these pesky animals away.

Outstanding service!  Francisco did an excellent job explaining the process of cleaning my attic, rodent proofing and replacing the insulation.  He explained the pricing, pros and cons of each option and current company promotions. The  crew that did the work was amazing as well.  They were thorough, efficient and polite.  They showed up on time and left my house without a trace of dirt from cleaning the attic.  The lead was Danis who was a great team leader.  I couldn't have been more impressed by everyone involved.  Atticare is lucky to have such great,  hard-working employees!</Review>

Very professional from start to finish. After the initial free inspection, it took me a while to get back to them and they just picked up where we left off. Appointment was scheduled, they showed up early, but waited outside until I noticed they were there and called. They said they were instructed not to disturb us until 9 am (appointment time), so I told them to go ahead whenever they were ready. Fernando and his team did a great job and got it all done in one day (on a Sunday!)</review>

<review>I called Attic Care because of suspected bird dropping and noise from the celling.  We received coupon in the mail.  For $95 they were willing to clean up the attic.  When Dan, the technician came to my house with his assistant Roberto, they were extremely professional and timely.  The work was done first class.  Both gentlemen provided excellent service.  We were very pleased and will call them again in the future.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>I had a bad case of rodent infestation in the attic and it needed rodent proofing, cleanup and insulation material replacement. Right from the point of estimation to the completion of work the Atticare team demonstrated great professionalism and executed a meticulous and very thorough job.

<review>I just had my attic cleaned, rodent proofed and new insulation.  I would like to say that the technicians and crew were excellent.

Francisco came to estimate the work.  He was clear concise but detailed in his explanation and estimate of costs. He did not have to deliver a "sales pitch".  He was polite and willing to answer any questions. He demonstrated his commitment and belief in the product and services he was proposing. I wish all contractors and estimates for home improvements were as transparent.

Danis and his crew were equally professional.  They came on time completed the work as promised. The results were as fantastic. They were neat, tidy and polite.<//review>< pictures>

< Review>
I called the Atticare to give me an estimate for rodent issue that we have in the crawl space and got schedule for the same week inspection.
The tech person Ian arrived 10 minutes earlier and check all the possible option from the attic, to the crawl space and even from the outside of the house.
He gave me a quote to clean the crawl space and close all the possible entry points and also offer to fix me some duct issue with no charge and we booked the work for the next week.
Its been already almost a mont and the company send a technician per our request to inspect that all is clean. Photos looks great and I’m very glad that so far so good.

For sure I will recommend them!<//Review>

Excellent experience.  They were out within a day of my original phone call to give me an estimate.  Very fair price.  The crew who cleaned and re-tarped underneath our home was very professional and thorough.  This company is very tech savvy which made the entire experience smooth and easy!  Thank You!</text>

They were prompt, clean, friendly and efficient. Although the only access to our attic is in a bedroom closet, when the job was completed, there was no sign that anyone had ever been in the house. I would recommend Atticare to anyone looking to replace their insulation.< /text>

<text>We had rodent issue for 3 to 4 months. We finally gave up trying to solve the issue our selves. So we called Atticare for help. We had an inspection done and the following week they came and proofed our house. They were on time, fast and thorough with their work. Louis was great and explained everything they have done and even told me I have a leaking pipe. They even told me to call them to have them come back like 6 months or 2 months prior to my warranty expiring to make sure everything is going well. Very professional. Would definitely recommend them.< /text>< Pictures>

The first job was for the attic last year- the place was a complete mess with a massive amount of rodent droppings and a true health hazard. We contacted Atticare from web search and because they are Oakland based, gave them the business after a visit from their technician. In one day a very professional crew completely cleaned the space, put in new insulation and rodent proofed entrances. Very good job. This past week we had Atticare again for the basement crawlspace, also rat infested. Again, one day for the professional crew that did an outstanding job. The technician Aaron was professional, did accurate bid and great follow up. We fully recommend Atticare to anyone in the Bay Area - a pleasure to work with.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Danis, the project manager was great to work with.  And I am happy that in one full day, our crawl space was cleared and sanitized.   New insulation and screens were installed and our house is inspected to prevent further intrusion.

The team put plastic sheets from floor to ceiling to corentine the trap door, so no debris or air could contaminate the rest of the room. That minimized the vacuuming and sanitizing after, which I appreciated. Great to have a peace of mind and clean air for the kids now.<//Text>

<Review>Honest. Knowledgeable. Friendly. Professional.

Dave A. is the technician who came to give us an estimate...on time, all prepared with booties, clipboard and ladder. He called to keep us abreast of his arrival time, too. The best part was how we benefited based on his recommendation on how the work should be looked at and get done it done cost effectively.

We needed to get our garage attic cleaned (rodent feces) and sanitized before we get some upgrades done to the garage. We also have a lot of items in the garage and attic, which would have been difficult for them to do a good job.  He was very knowledgeable, precise with his answers/comments and patient in explaining what would be the best course of action that we hadn't even thought of. With light plumbing and electrical work we will be doing to the garage, Dave point out there will be new holes, cracks and gaps that'll get created, which will allow for new entries for rodents and defeating all of the clean up and sanitizing work. Why pay twice for the work and more importantly, not solve the access issue. Instead, we decided to get the upgrades done first and then call them back when the work is done. Thanks, Dave for being a good person! And, thinking this process correctly and working with us by giving us couple options on how to be cost effective with the approach. And, most importantly...for being honest. Hard to find this from a service provider today. Other customers will benefit when they get you in the future.</Review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1473955762908, 'text': 'Thank you for the great review of our team!

<Date>1438123802817< /Date><review>We had Atticare inspect for rodent infestation in our attic. They found a horrible mess, cleaned it up, disinfected the attic with Chlorine spray, and blew in new insulation. We were happy. Then, almost a year later we heard noises in the attic. Atticare came out to inspect and found nothing. We continued to hear noises in the attic. They agreed to come out for another free inspection, even though the warranty was now expired by 1 month. This time they found a birds nest, and thankfully no rats. There was an attic vent with a small hole in it very high off the ground that they had missed when they sealed the attic at the time of the original clean up. They fixed the vent for free. We are very happy with their desire to make us a satisfied customer, even more than a year since the work was done. David was out technician. Hats off to Atticare!<//review>< user>

These guys were fantastic, especially the crew leader Jay Quinteros.  In redoing our attic insulation and ducting and rodent-proofing they were prompt, efficient, did additional unanticipated work for a discounted price, cleaned up thoroughly, and did the whole job in the estimated two days even though it required extra long hours on their part.  It is such a pleasure to work with honest, competent contractors who deliver what they promise.  Highest recommendation.< /Text>

On the day of repair, the team (of 3) came and finished the whole job in one day. We had a decent size crawlspace and they installed the insulation, cleaning and installed vapor barrier before the sun went down.
In the end, they let me go into the space with them to show me all the work.
Price was reasonable and fair, and now we feel more safe (we don't hear animals scratching under our floors).

Dan was my technician and he was AWESOME! He was very courteous, upfront and very honest which are qualities I deemed very important for a service provider. I initially requested Atticare SF to do the $100 attic cleanup special as advertised, but Dan saw that there were very few mice droppings in my attic so he insisted to do it for free! He didn't charge me for vacuuming my attic and what deal could be better than that? Definitely recommend this company and will keep contact information because I will call them if I ever have attic problems in the future!!! SUPERB CUSTOMER SERVICE!</Text>

Poor customer service, period! First they will talk nicely to get your business but once you pay,  they will not be interested in providing any support! Go with your own risk. They did shoddy job and rodents came back again after few months. Just for the inspection of the house where they did work in the past 18 months, they will charge you $200. Unfortunate to see people not taking pride in their quality of work!</Review>

Poor customer service, period! First they will talk nicely to get your business but once you pay,  they will not be interested in providing any support! Go with your own risk. They did shoddy job and rodents came back again after few months. Just for the inspection of the house where they did work in the past 18 months, they will charge you $200. Unfortunate to see people not taking pride in their quality of work!< /review>

<Review>In April 2017 I requested bids from four attic clean-up companies to clean my attic. From the four offers I selected AttiCare. Their bid was very competitive and included all the items I wanted. They offered to remove all the old blown-in insulation, debris, and animal droppings; disinfect; seal all ceiling openings into the house; seal against rodent entry; cover any improperly installed pot lights; and install new R38 batting insulation.
AttiCare offered a number of dates from which to choose. They were scheduled to arrive between 9am and 11am. Juan Rosales arrived at 10am with his crew of three. They immediately set to work and had cleaned out the attic by 1pm. I inspected and found the work satisfactory and they then installed the new batting in about an hour. They were packed up and gone by 4pm.
I was very pleased with the timeliness and work performed by Juan Rosales and his crew.</Review></record>

These guys have great customer service. They took all day to clean out and install insulation— they also were the most competively priced (thanks Gil) . They took all of my items out of the attic and put them back in and even allowed offered to haul any garbage away that I did not want. This was a huge bonus. Gil also followed up to ensure I was satisfied. He was very professional and helpful.

The only downside was a small hole ended up in my wall while they were working (accidents happen) but they immediately booked a handyman (Jeremy was great!) who came out patched the hole and did a beautiful and efficient job repainting - it looks as good as new.

I would definitely recommend these guys — this is a very expensive procedure and I felt this was the best deal and value.<//text>

Had some problem with our attic, Michael from atticare came on a cold Saturday morning. He was very prompt, courteous, and professional. The first inspection was free. Michael identified the problem, told us what we can do. It turns out his company doesn't do what we needed, but Michael was still very patient with us, explained our options and gave us various suggestions. IMO, he did beyond what he supposed to do. I'll not hesitate to contact him and his company if we need their services. Highly recommended!< /review>

Michael explained everything in careful detail and the quote estimate & language was crafted to my satisfaction. I was verrrrrry pleased with the work completed by the Atticare Crew in clearing and cleaning both the attic and crawl space, sealing entry points and totally reinsulating the attic.  Hard Work that was professionally and thoroughly completed. I highly recommend Michael & Atticare for anyone needing to deal with "rats in their belfry".< /Review>< gmapID>

Attic Care made good on most of their promises.  I was disappointed that the gentleman that talked us into working with their company did not come out at the end to confirm the job was done as he promised.  Granted he and the company have been swamped with work.

Attic Care did a good job.  Both teams were friendly and professional. They protected my home by putting down plastic and moving furniture they thought might get damaged.  They also cleaned up after they left. My only complaints are 1) the ugly way they sealed exterior holes with foam, 2) the promise to sanitize with bleach around the perimeter of the property so rats would not find they're way back didn't happen and 3) I felt a little rushed to sign-off at the end of the process.<//Text>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>Found out that some squirrels had made their way into my attic and decided to stay.  Called AtticCare to deal with my problem.

They came out and inspected the attic and confirmed that there was a coupe of entry points and signs that they had started to make a home.  They gave me an estimate right on the spot.  Way lower than I was expecting for removing my old insulation, rodent proofing my attic, sealing any gaps, sanitizing the area, and laying down new R38 batting.

Elmar and his crew did a fantastic job in the attic and cleaning up the job site.<//review><response>{'time': 1524878828362, 'text': "Dear Souza Family, Thank you for writing an honest and detailed review, we're also very glad you decided to work with our company!

Worked with Gil (estimate) and Netanel (foreman) on a nasty crawlspace cleanup project (construction debris, dead rodents & droppings, moisture damaged insulation, etc.). Both were very professional, courteous, and prompt. I really appreciated the care the crew gave to our house, protecting the area around the crawlspace opening in the kitchen pantry with plastic on the floors, walls, doors, etc.< /Text>

Had some problem with our attic, Michael from atticare came on a cold Saturday morning. He was very prompt, courteous, and professional. The first inspection was free. Michael identified the problem, told us what we can do. It turns out his company doesn't do what we needed, but Michael was still very patient with us, explained our options and gave us various suggestions. IMO, he did beyond what he supposed to do. I'll not hesitate to contact him and his company if we need their services. Highly recommended!< /text>

<Time>1562625283424<//Time><Rate>5<//Rate><review>Once more, Atticare USA came through when we needed to address rodents in our home!  They are timely, professional, thorough and extremely fair in their pricing - particularly for all that they do.  In their recent visit, they took great care to prep the work site, as well as completely clean prior to leaving.  Their follow up, afterwards, was also comprehensive and prompt.  In the end, Atticare is clearly a company that wants to ensure their clients are completely satisfied with all aspects of what they do and for what they charge to do it.

I cannot recommend their work highly enough.  In the very least, if you have this kind of unfortunate circumstance, give them an opportunity to come out and provide a complete evaluation and quote.  They are not interested in "up-selling", and I have found them to be fair, honest and extremely reliabl

The entire experience from the initial call, meeting with Estimator Connor and the extremely professional team who did the work in our crawl space, Frandi, Kelmer and William was outstanding.  I obtained bids from a number of established, local businesses prior to choosing Atticare USA.  Not only was the bid from them considerably more competitive, but the approach was more thorough and I felt I was not being "upsold" with what they proposed.

They communicated well, were on time, and did not rush through the job.  Connor actually stopped by in person to ensure all was going well, and the team actually took many before and after photos and videos to ensure we felt all was completed to our satisfaction.  They also pledge in writing to stand behind their work, in the event something doesn't turn out as anticipated.

Bottom line - a crawl space cleanup is really unpleasant and, unfortunately, expensive.  My recommendation is that if you can avoid it by making sure your crawl space is secured, then great.  But.  If you have had a situation that necessitates the need to address it, Atticare USA, Connor and their experienced, polite, thorough and professional crew(s) is a great option all the way around.  Thank you, Atticare and Connor and crew!</review>< Pics>

< Review>
These guys are absolutely terrific. The estimator, Ian, was very easy to work with and made great suggestions for the work to be done. Best of all, their price quote was very reasonable. After considering the original proposal, I needed to make some changes and Ian was very accommodating. Since my house had asbestos, Ian put me in touch with a remediation company and they coordinated the scheduling of the work so that the remediation was done one day and the AttiCare work immediately the next day. The workers arrived on time and were very friendly and professional. They got to work right away and worked hard throughout the day. They cleaned the attic, put in fresh insulation, radiant barriers, and brand new air ducts. They also put in insulation and new ducts in the crawlspace with air duct boots where needed. They ran out of insulation and barrier material so the job wasn’t fully completed on the first day, but it was very easy to work with Ian on scheduling a couple guys to come out and finish the job. Overall it’s been a terrific experience with AttiCare and they deliver as promised at a resonable price. I highly highly recommend.</Review>

<UserId.>105293015856139633920<//UserId.><review>I called Atticare from the $95 "Attic cleanup" Valpak coupon to find and remove a dead rodent from my attic.
Shawn showed up on time and was very friendly and ready to get to work. He went into one attic but only found an old birds nest - which he removed - but no rodent carcass. He then went into a 2nd attic but didn't find a carcass there either. He then went into 2 different crawl spaces under the house but didn't find any carcasses there either. He said my insulation is in pretty good condition with some evidence of rodent tracks but nothing really bad enough to warrant replacing it.
He asked to use the bathroom and when done he said "well, sorry I wasn't able to find the issue you called us out about". I said, "no problem - you went above and beyond. I'll write a check". He responded "I don't have anything to write on an invoice so I can't charge you for anything". I said "No, you spent an hour here, I'll pay the fee on the coupon". He said "No, I can't write an invoice, I can't take a fee".
Holy cow! I've NEVER had a vendor do something like that!
Shawn was not only a pleasure to deal with but honest to a fault. Atticare has my business any time I need any of the services they provide. Ask for Shawn to come out when you call them - he's not just honest, he's a pleasure to work with.
Note to management - we want honest vendors like you around so please at least charge the coupon rate.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<gmapID>0x80857e607057b533:0x8ff548299d149ba3< /gmapID><Review>The day before Atticare came out, we received a $1,350 estimate from another attic cleaning company.
After Atticare's representative, Daniel Levy, came down from our attic, he sat us down and told us that there was so little to be done in our attic that he advises us to leave it alone or to send a handyman up there to reattach some insulation in a few places and to pick up some chewed-up insulation pieces that rats had caused a few years earlier.
The next day I went up there on my own and did the work in about 40 minutes.
While I cannot verify that Atticare does this with all of its customers, I will say that it's the first time I ever heard an estimate that amounted to 0 dollars.<//Review>< Rate>

<review>No one like the litter patter of rats in the attic or the mess they leave behind. Initially I contacted my monthly pest control company and learned very quickly they are not skilled with the necessary tasks involved other than killing the rats. I met with 3 attic remediation companies and found Ian and Elmer from Atticare to be extraordinarily thorough and more importantly thoughtful regarding keeping my property covered while they remediate.  Ian was very professional and again thorough of the job involved (2500 sq feet), advised me of a chunk of HVAC asbestos that someone left unbeknownst to me, and described in detail the scheduling involved.  Elmer came in with the nasty task of actual removal of yuck, and insulation the critters called home.  They take pictures and Elmer showed me exactly where they were getting in which wasn’t from the trees that hung over our home.  Again thorough and their estimate is competitive.  I’ve recommended them already to my friends in the San Mateo area.< /review>< Pictures>

Sean, the professional who checked out my basement for an estimate, was honest and professional in his approach, Within a short time, he identified where rats had been getting in to the basement and pointed out that, with the dirt floor, the expense of cleanup would soar and there could be no guarantee of their work. He could easily have sold me a bill of goods , taken my $$ and then shrugged his shoulders when the problem recurred; instead, he gave me practical advice on my next best stap. I will surely use this service when I prepare the home for sale.< /review>

Michael K from Atti Care was great! He confirmed his appointment before showing up and arrived on-time. Even though it was stormy outside, Mike took his time to do a complete check of our attic and crawl space. He answered all of our questions and made sure that we understood each of the issues in his report. Afterwards, Michael followed up with us and made sure he answered any additional questions we had. He was always very quick to respond by text or email. Great service from Mike and Atti Care from start to finish!</review>

They were the only company out of 10 I called that picked up the phone and were available for consultation. They came that same day and stayed to investigate and talk about the situation at hand for about 2 hours. It is clear that they want to provide people with all of the details and the best solutions. After the initial consultation, the crew came 2 days later and cleaned out our old insulation, blocked off animal entries, vacuumed and completely turned the grossness around. They were hard working and thorough. Francisco who helped us was very kind and let us know how the process was going throughout the day. He took before and after photos to show us the results and offered to come out for a free meeting a month later to assure no more creatures had gotten in. Overall a wonderful experience- fast response time, great customer service, great work, and kind people! Would definitely recommend.</Review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1493054373907, 'text': "Dear Sydney Carroll,\n\nThank you for the great review of our team.

Danis and his crew did a great job removing and reinstalling attic insulation in my home. My attic is very short so space is tight and moving around is hard, I was amazed at how fast they were able to compete the job. The crew all had on proper PPE and took all necessary precautions to keep the old fiberglass off the floors and driveway. Danis also showed me the work and made sure I was happy with it before his crew packed up. From the estimate to the final work, AtticCare showed professionalism and commitment to quality, definitely recommended.</Review>

Our experience with Atticare was really positive and we are excited about the improvements now that the hot summer is approaching. We needed insulation in our attic (there was virtually none) and repairs to our ducts, which were in bad shape and we suspected had leaks. The bid inspection was performed by Daniel and he was extremely thorough. Daniel gave us confidence that he knew the needs of our home. Atticare gave us a fair quote and even rodent-proofed our crawl space vents during the bid visit for free! After discussing a competitor's lower quote, Atticare matched the quote.

As for the job itself, Bo and his team were very punctual and they performed the services on a Sunday which is an enormous help to homeowners that are away at work mon-fri. Bo took care to keep our home clean from all the attic and crawl space dirt and dust that this work involves. Our attic is now clean, rodent proofed, and insulated, and our ducts look fantastic and leak-proof.<//text>

I was bothered by the rats in the attic for so many years.  I had the services using baits or the services using traps, but they rats were still coming back year after year.  I don't want to think how dirty it can be up there.  I happened to see Atticare's ad.  I'm so happy because that's the correct way to resolve the problem.  And I don't like the old foam insulation in our attic.  After we have Francisco give us an estimate, we put the work in two phases.  First, cleaned up the attic, sanitized the whole space, and fixed all the possible access from top to bottom, from inside to outside.  Leave it for 2 months, there is no rat/mouse track.  Then we started 2nd part of work, put new batt insulation in attic, and do the same things for crawling space.  They just finished the work yesterday.  They did a very good job!<//text>

Michael Katz was the specialist assigned to handle my service. He called before coming over and managed to come sooner than the arrival window.

He came ready and prepared for the initial inspection. He measured the existing attic space and insulation and then gave his recommendations based on the space and structure. He went through the various options available to me (batts/rolls, blow-in, reflective) and what he thought was best for the situation.

His estimates for scope of work was detailed and clear, and walked me through what to expect on the day of service — from preparation to sealing to installation and cleanup, as well as expected timeframe.

Scheduling was easy and communication was excellent. Look for Michael and you'll be pleased with his speed and professionalism.</text>

<text>Dr. Suda is extremely professional and clean. Keeps the family pets healthy and happy. Very reasonable rates and they take walk ins.

Dr. Suda is an amazing veterinarian.  I wouldn't trust anyone else with my fur babies. He doesn't pad the bill with a bunch of unnecessary treatments.</Text>

<review>Awesome veterinary practice.  Dr. Suda is committed to giving his clients and patients the best service possible and is very reasonably priced.  He does not recommend or push unnecessary tests or procedures.  I am glad I was accepted into his practice before he stopped taking new patients.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

My family has been taking our pets here since 2001, this is by far the best vet in town and I hear this from many family friends and acquaintances from over the years as well. And also, they don’t charge an arm and a leg to tend to your pets, most vets and pet hospitals take advantage of you being desperate when your pet is injured or sick, but the olive veterinary Hospital has a heart and cares.< /Text>

Ive been taking my dogs & cats to This pet hospital for over 40 years. I can solidly say that Dr. Suda is an very experienced and friendly veterinarian, great sense of humor. The staff is beyond competent. Prices are very reasonable. Olive Veterinary Hospital will go the extra mile for you and your pets. I strongly recommend this group!< /Text>

My family has gone to Olive Vet hospital since the 60's, yes he can be very busy, yes he errs on the side of caution and because he does not charge a lot, I get sticker shock when I go other places. I live in Texas now and if I could I would take all my pets to them because I know they will get the best and most humane treatment in town< /Text>

<Review>My family has taken all of our dogs and cats to Olive Vet for many years, first to Dr. Suda senior and now to his son, Michael. I have been to Vets in other cities but have never experienced the excellent care that Dr. Michael gives to our pets and he has never over billed as so many local Vets do. He has a very busy practice as there are obviously many people who recognize an excellent Vet and person. Also, Maggie and David who work in the office are always just as pleasant and helpful.

Dr. Suda has been 'our' veterinarian after the passing of his father. He has never failed to be totally attentative and complete in the care of our animals. I always receive 'call backs' concening visits, medications, etc. his care is reasonably priced in consideration of his clients - so rare these days. His assistant (Maggie) is a perfect fit for the office. She does a wonderful job considering what her 'duties' are: the most difficult I would imagine is having to see and give news to all of the 'parents' of the patients when it is not always 'good news'. I appreciate him and wanted to let him and his team know! Keep up the fantastic care to Dr. Suda and his team.<//text>

<review>Came here on a Sunday afternoon, in the drive thru. Ordered California Burrito ($6.99), Tostada (Flying saucer $7.99), Large nachos ($5.00) , and also 3 cajeta churros ($1.25 each).

The price was so cheap and the taste was absolutely amazing. So delicious thank you guys for everything.

I attached the pictures to everything.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNgSqdqUKBhP-Z_LXHlSRm6OOq3XM7xK9qC_s2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPN1JuAX_YfZjTPoM_i8NsL5SVHiAVEzs4AmLog=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-ZZyF_rcurSDJvRsbfOTHLnlLojmP1dMVQHDu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMY_exCVdl67Npp1jKNIW5Rvo6p4WCz1XfI7Rst=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0GN5ZeXVHvDDb9KgFi0XgShD4Hdl6CkPH2Ia-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMOJ3HlpSt5w3h3-My6n7GouGBLViNyfoAG7RP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlLH4dfFVQnu4D2Do_fEIGJp9WhIbXI7So-g55=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3Oc8VCh1_xQ4qeRgN2106NEW5qdV2daXH_vZ3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNohPHX99ReKgA4FX9K7LkcClZNvs9n96M6AMvR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQ8A45yDqqzOGTHQWW2M5AzD5dpHeNh4BTekdS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzThR9JqASetPCUR0OeOtoHbSgJkIVHn6BUSjD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Let me just tell you...
This place is everything! All good and nothing bad.
I ordered the Carne Asada fries and this is my opinion on them:
-HUGE portions, extremely heavy. Definitely didn't skimp out on the meat.
-The taste was on point. No blandness whatsoever.
-The staff wasn't at all difficult like some. They catered to our request about having sour cream and guacamole in the side. Some places have issue with this for some reason.
-Extremely reasonable pricing. This giant order of Carne Asada fries was only $8.
-On top of everything else, they offer something they don't need to. They give 15% military discount as well. That alone makes me want to go back to support those who support us.

Anyway, I definitely recommend this place out. I'm glad I did and I'll be going back for sure whenever I'm on that side of town.</Review>

They've become quite good lately. Fresh ingredients and the simplified menu has helped. I really like their red salsa, it's now one of the top three favorites of mine.< /review>

My expectations were low, but their food blew me away!  It was fantastically delicious!  It was also super fast and they were very friendly.

Quick and delicious. Got a California burrito without dairy and it was still delicious. Will definitely be coming back.
Fyi:
1) Only outdoor seating (no indoor)
2) the homeless have overtaken half of the tables
4) there's only about 3 regular parking spots and 1 handicap
3) there is a drive-thru<//Review>

<Date>1544833481126< /Date><Review>Finally got to stop in and check out the new ownership. I had added this business when it converted over from Roberto's and had been trying to get in on Taco Tuesday's but finally caved in on a Friday.

I wish I could say it was a good experience but I wasn't left with anything positive. Service wasn't rude but perfunctory. I asked about adding guacomole to my $2.88 beef taco and they wanted $1.99! The prices have definitely gone up from previous owners and the taco was bland and the meat was cold.

While I understand "No Public Restrooms" I have always understood that to mean "Customers Only". But I was told no and then watched as a customer in a suit walked out of it 3 minutes later. All in all? Not interested enough to go back on a Taco Tuesday. :/</Review>< rate>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Ive been looking for a new Mexican food place to eat. Yesterday i had the bacon carne asada burrito and 5 rolled tacos. It was amazing! Everything was fresh, seasoning is on point, the hot sauce is actually spicy (seems hard to find these days). Im actually heading back there now. I definitely reccomend this place!<//text>< Pics>

<Text>We enjoy eating out. Today we invited good friends to this magnificent place. We had a phenomenal experience there with great food, a professional server - Matthew (easy going, knowledgeable about the menu and took care of us). A great experience. We will definitely visit again soon. We highly recommend.< /Text>< user_name>

We were promptly greeted and seated. Once we got situated, our server (Matthew) took our drink and food orders. So the customer service was excellent. The rolls took a while to show up at our table, but was otherwise delicious. I ordered the Scallop Maniac (which is honestly a lot like a "Lion King" roll, but with scallop. I also ordered the That's How I Roll, which came with a small salad on the plate. It was a nice touch and a good amount of dressing. I loved both of the rolls, but would still go for the "Hawaiian," which is my favorite.<//Review><gmapID>0x809addbec41be689:0x2f56f281a490d18< /gmapID><rating>4<//rating></record></dataset><record>

<Text>My top favorite sushi restaurant in this city hands down. When friends and family of mine come from out of town to visit, this is the most common place to bring them. Mainly because I know their food is high quality so there’s always a great meal and they’ll want to come back again. Been coming here for over 5 years and Can confirm you can’t go wrong coming here.<//Text>< Pics>

So attentive and knowledgeable about the restaurant menu and listened so well to my girlfriend and my requests for suggestions. We didn’t know what to expect but we’re very happy with the meals and wanted to say that if the woman answering the phones wasn’t an owner, I may need to try to hire her myself:) Great job Sky Sushi!</Text>< userid>

Sky Sushi is always on point with the food quality and customer service. Keep in mind because of their popularity there will be a sometimes lengthy wait in getting a hold of them as we’re in a Pandemic so they’re service is curbside only. I’m not the only one that ❤️’s their food, so get in line. I’m always greeted with a smile and they’re very consistent and consistency means a lot to me. I’m in the customer service industry, so I recognize good service when I see and experience it.
You won’t be disappointed!

Sincerely,

B</Text>

I highly recommend the Scallop Maniac and G-String rolls. Definitely my favorite sushi place in Rancho. My girlfriend and I have been coming here every other weekend for the past 6 years and I can honestly say that the quality and consistency is very good. We've never had a bad roll from here. Staff is very friendly and attentive. I highly recommend this establishment for sushi.< /Text>

< Review>
We went here for the first time last night, and I'm so glad we did! My family loves sushi that highlights fresh raw fish, and we all enjoyed our rolls, and udon. With the funny, creative roll names, we had to first read thru all the descriptions (which were clearly written out on their website) of each roll, we ordered 5 and a veggie udon. Can't remember all, but there was an "Arigato", a "knocked up", "show me your love", "playboy"...and another.

When we drove up to Sky Sushi, we stayed in the car, called them that we were there, and they brought out the sushi.

As we drove home, I said "how are we supposed to remember which roll is which?". But to my surprise (and relief), each box was labeled with what roll was inside. What a wonderful detail they thoughtfully added to make our identification so much easier. I've never experienced that. Love it.

We received a good amount of wasabi, pickled ginger, soy sauce, napkins, and chopsticks, which is also a big plus! Friendly staff rounded out our 5-star first experience with Sky Sushi.

I just wanted to mention that the vegetable udon was also really good. It really hit the spot on a cold day!

We will be back for more!<//Review>

I love Sky and have been coming here for celebratory dinners for several years. The staff are all incredibly kind and attentive and the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing. It doesn't attract rowdy crowds or families with unruly children, and the food is always totally excellent.

My favorite roll is "wait a minute." They also have delicious tempura vegetables, and I get their house salad every time. Their dinner options and appetizers are just as good as their sushi.< /text>

My friend and I wanted some Sushi as we driving home she spotted the sign and I turned in we ordered the Kamikaze, irresistible and ... I gave 4**** only because my order was togo and 2 different order items were put together in one container. It has ALWAYS been experience to have all plates put in their own containers. My first time there not knowing this was a somewhat regular practice for Sky Sushi I took as we were only given 2 of 3 paid entrees. When I came back 15 min. later to discuss and get my order corrected, the PERFECT resolution happened Allen the sous chef explained, resolved AND made right my experience. With that I would go back again
All Thanks to Allen for good business<//review>

<Time>1592599202252<//Time><rating>3</rating><text>Best way to describe it...it's Rancho Cordova sushi. Don't expect ocean fresh this far from the ocean I guess. Had the salmon, tuna, and yellow tail sashimi. Tuna and salmon both appeared to be of the same quality, not fresh. The yellow tail had dark fat strips on it and was discolored. I just moved here from LA so I guess my expectations may be too high....the pan fried gyoza was barely warm in the center and the sushi roll we ordered was a 3/10 at best. I would avoid this place unless you have no other option for sushi.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>'20/2 1st time review, but customer for handful of years:
-- Located in a safe, older, tired Rancho Cordova strip mall that's well kept considering. Little transient presence.
-- While located on one of the busiest corners in Rancho Cordova and east Sacramento (Sunrise and Coloma), it does not inhibit easy in/out of strip mall--though peek rush hour requires navigating the heavily used three roads adjoining the mall.
-- For handicapped, there is parking, but will still be a walk to front door given location of restaurant in mall in relation to the designated handicap parking stalls.
-- Always a sandwich board outside and on the wall in small waiting area (see 3 pix posted). Well worth indulging, as chefs are culinary creators in taste and presentation.
-- Extensive drink/food menus and other specials (see pix uploaded for all).
-- Super impressed with dish/drink choices, visual presentation, and taste of food. Many different sauces, "bedding", toppings, and flavors impresses with each return trip.
-- Excellent, attentive wait staff. Kind, informative, helpful, and genuine--not pretentious.
-- Pickup counter is to the back of this small restaurant, and restroom past that.
-- Booth seating along south wall with table and sushi-bar counter seating taking up the rest of the floor space.
-- Did not see if offered booster chairs.
-- Yes, bathroom. Did not see quantity or if unisex.< /Review>< GmapID>

We are avid sushi lovers and have been visiting Sky for years.  It never disappoints. The food is fantastic and the service is spectacular. Our waiter Lucas is the best! We absolutely recommend this place for everyone,  family,  couples, solo... give it a try.  You'll love it!!<//text>

EVERYTHING here has been soooo good. They have a great variety of rolls with a great price. The nigiri is very fresh and high quality.  Can’t recommend this gem of place enough!</review>

My absolute favorite sushi restaurant, and a must-go every time I visit Sacramento. Their fish is great quality and the food is delicious. Try the garlic edamame, and I highly recommend the "Who's Your Daddy" roll! The tempura cheesecake is a delightful dessert to finish it off.<//text>

<Text>It's one of mine and my girlfriend's favorite sushi places in all of Sacramento they're top-notch on their quality and consistency servers can vary because you know it's a restaurant and people change here in there but usually we get greeted with the same servers and they're very nice it's very welcoming that they recognized me and my girlfriend's face they know that we love the extra ginger so when i ask they give us a boatload and trust me we eat every inch of it the atmosphere is nice and relaxing. the sushi chefs always look very professional and on there game I very highly recommend this place to anybody from big party too small or one person it is amazing Sushi must try place</Text>< userid>

Came in tonight with my SO and we were seated at a table after standing for a few min. It was a little busy, but after hearing a group of 6 nearby saying they havnt gotten their drinks (they were there long before we arrived) i got concerned.
We looked at the menu, decided what to order, and sat there. About 3 minutes comes by and our waiter shows up to introduce himself. We place our order, and he rushes off. About a good 5 min goes by, and our drinks (hot tea) arrives, then we are waiting more and more... just even for the waiter because i asked for sugar with the tea when we placed our order and i received none... Then im seeing people come in after us, and they are placing their orders, and getting their food.
We never got our food and a good nother 20 min goes by. We were hungry. We decided to get up, and leave (never touched the tea) and went somewhere else. Wont be coming back here again. Thanks for making us wait for nothing.<//Text>< pics>

This is the best I have ever had. I came from Southern California and it doesn’t compare to what I’ve tasted there. “I’m picky too”. Try the garlic edemame in garlic sauce. The Fresh prince and the knocked up are my favorites!< /review>

I came at a slow time during the rain and was seated at my favorite booth. The quality of service was great and the quality of food was great as well! It came out at a reasonable time and everything was fresh. You can see the preparation and bar from every angle in the restaurant.<//Review>

Absolutely perfect! Sushi is incredibly fresh, great specials to try, and the ambiance is nice. When I found out it's the same family owned restaurant as the one in EDH I knew it was going to be great. The White Ferrari (special) was amazing and my go-to is the naked salmon if you want no rice. Pair it with the best nigori and you'll be in heaven.<//text>

Found this place on a recommendation of a acquaintance who suggested we try it. We dropped immid week in the late afternoon. A young chief was working the sushi bar counter. He welcomed us and asked what would we like to have. We ordered a couple of apetizer dishes from the kitchen and asked for white fish nigiri. He demurred, and offered sea bass which he suggested was good. It was. We moved on from there. Being sushi traditionalists we ordered all nigiri and a couple of temaki rolls. The fish was delicious, well prepared and beautifully presented. We have been back a few times and had semi omakase meals, which all turned out delicious. This is a real find. Chief Jay is thoughtful, careful in preparing each dish and recommending the best cuts. Truly a master of his craft, one of less than a handful in the Sacramento area. Highly recommended.</Text>

The reason for the five stars is due to the amazing service we had during our visit at Sky Sushi🤗❗ I enjoyed the dimmed ambiance of the location, it appears that the sushi sensation is very clean and the staff is quick with curtious manners. I recommend that you visit, you will not be disappointed💯👌🏾</review>

The two stars is for the food 👎👎

Not good.
The bento box was a joke nothing good there but the lettuce. The rest was either cold or soggy.

The sushi I got not sure the name but it  was $20  but  50% off so $10
It had  salmon shrimp avocado garlic sauce.  Sounds good but was completely soggy and not good at all.

If i was closer I would have drove back and ask for a refund.

For Sushi 🍣 thats yummy and less expensive go a  few miles down the road to Sushimono  by sunrise Avenue and Madison< /review>

<Review>I have always said "I don't like sushi" my friend Natasha was determined to prove me wrong and oooo. Did she. Walking inside the place seemed very relaxing R&B music what! I wouldn't have guessed. I read over the menu which was easy for me to understand due to the way it's structured. Letting you know what's inside,outside and on top. I Went with the Lemon Crispy tuna,ceabmeat,cream cheese deep fried in panko bread crumbs delicious!!!!! Chili's sauce on the side Omg I guess I can say one eat sushi Now! I also tried others with salmon and shrimp also delicious. I DEFINITELY recommend this place.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>This is old fish being served at a discounted rate compared to other restaurants. The fish smells which is  terrible. The server was ok not great, The person did not know about items on the actual menu when asked. I was served multiple plates while my friend which is female was served none and her plates were up before mine. So having to wait on food that was ready to be served is not considered service. Won't dine here again.<//Review>< user>

Sky sushi is okay, the wait was longer then expected for sure and it wasn't up lifting for me to want to come back. Possibly a 5 or 6 month visit for me.<//review>

(Translated by Google) Everything was very good but I do not know if we arrived a little late good service but then they told us that we had to go almost did not eat comfortable I did not like that if they are going to close better do not assume more customers that makes us feel bad for us thank you very much it's first time i come to this restaurant i always go to the other

Todo estubo muy bien pero no se si llegamos un poco tarde buen servicio pero luego nos dijeron que nos teniamos que ir casi no comimos agusto no me gusto eso si ya van a cerrar mejor no asepten mas clientes eso nos hace sentir  mal a nosotros los clientes muchas gracias es primera ves que vengo a este restaurante simpre voy al otro< /Review>

Truly my favorite auto repair shop anywhere. Despite moving back to Los Angeles, I have yet to find a place as honest or good working as Polycare. Owner Brian taught me more about my car and the auto industry as a whole than all shops combined. I even noticed he adjusted a gap in my soft top without me asking nor him mentioning! Abs nothing negative to say about polycare.<//Text>

Staff wears masks while interacting with clients, AND while inside the vehicles. Service is being impacted by the "End of Year Rush" of people getting their rides fixed, so it might be awhile before your car/truck gets into a bay.
Still a Top Ten garage in San Diego.<//Text>

My trust in automobile service providers is only earned with fantastic experience, and Brian and the other great employees at Polycare Automotive are some of the best I have ever seen. They genuinely care about your vehicle and will go well above and beyond to treat you fairly and do their best to ensure your vehicle reaches its full potential.< /text>

<Review>It’s not every day that you are pleasantly surprised by an auto mechanic. I am a shady tree mechanic, and I came to Polycare Automotive with some pretty strange requests.  The guys at Polycare were genuinely interested in fixing the problem, and Jesus somehow talked me into it.

The bottom line is that my car is now running as good as it ever has, and Polycare charged me a very reasonable fee for a really high quality repair.  I don’t think that I have ever been so impressed by a mechanic.<//Review><user_name>KT</user_name><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Went in thinking I need my brake pads replaced because of a mild screeching sound. After inspection they said I don't need to replace anything and explained the source of the noise ( rust on the drums). And told me to come after a few months. Very honest! Didn't charge me anything for the inspection either!< /Text>

Called for a repair estimate for rear brakes and rotors because the dealer wanted to fix them for $424. Brian quoted $369 but said based on what the dealer told us, we don't really need service yet. Five stars for honesty!< /Text>

<review>best mechanics ever. my splash guard was ripped and hanging. they clearly explained to me what is going on and re attached it without charging me. before i left, the mechianic also tells me what to do to take care of the scrached paint on my door. A+ service, would go again if i ever need to.</review><gmapID>0x80dc07529b4a8727:0x2a784fb2c6d0c3f<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Brian and his crew are straight forward, NO BS, serious auto technicians. He's honest, he won't up sell any unecessary repairs, he's extremely knowledgeable, and he does great work. He's truly a rare breed of auto technician. If the fix is really simple (like something you could do w/o paying him), he'll walk you through it. Expert in Nissans. Also, free-wifi and tea/coffee. I highly recommend him.<//Review>

I purchased a groupon for an oil change and expected to pay the usual extra charges. I was charged an extra $40 because they said my vehicle takes 8qts of oil. I never heard of any car taking 8qts of oil. That price should have been discussed before the work was done, since it wasn't discussed makes me feel it was to intentionally ripp me off.< /review>

Highly recommend this place. Richard helped me with a price I could afford. As well as the guys in the garage. Had my battery charged when I got there and made sure tires had air.... The lady in the office was awesome as well.  Thanks Darlene Wilson.. I will recommend friends and family... Honest people</Text>

My tire had been leaking air even after I got it replaced somewhere else. This shop identified the problem, explained it to me, and fixed it in less than 20 minutes. I’ll definitely be coming here in the future.</review>

<Review>George was super helpful as always. It was my first time going to the San Bernardino location vs Redlands and the reception/office area was clean, nice and accommodating with WiFi etc.

But most of all, I have a Volvo and I won’t go anywhere else with my car now (other than a dealer). These guys are really great and always get the job done right at very reasonable rates. Highly recommend.< /Review>< pics>

Brought my car in and they were kind enough to give me a ride all the way down town so I could get back to work.….when they were done they came back and picked me up. Did great work on my car. needed engine work…runs excellent. I priced out the work at several shops before bringing the car in and Anies was the best deal. very friendly highly recommend them.</Text>

< Review>
Was stuck with an emergency as my vehicle was seriously overheating, After looking it over Angie explained it was most likely a clogged thermostat, that he could fix it but it would be much cheaper to do it myself and a relative easy fix.  Told me exactly what to do, and never charged me anything.  I went to the auto parts store got the part for $8 and fixed it myself in 30mins.  If Angie was such a "scammer" I don't think he would have helped me not making a dime in the process.<//Review>

We’ve used Mr. Sparkle for three years to clean our windows of our two story home and usually have them come every six months. They washed the outside of our windows in late December. The windows are spotless after accumulating fire smoke and grit over the summer. The window washers arrive on time and are very accommodating and do a great job.< /review>

<review>Very professional, had enough workman to get the job done quickly. One employee I talked to had been with them 5 years. After cleaning the gutters they replaced the gutter guards and told us they didn't need replacement. Mr Sparkle worked around our plants and ground covers making sure they were not damaged. All in all an excellent outcome< /review>< Time>

Yesterday I had Mr Sparkle come to clean my embarrassingly dirty windows. The team they sent out, Josh and Hunter, worked for 4 hours and delivered as promised, exceeding even the high expectations set by other reviewers.  My windows now actually Sparkle!

The price was certainly fair. These young men were masked at all times and maintained appropriate distance. They were courteous, hard working, efficient, and skilled. Having my windows professionally cleaned for the first time was definitely a brilliant idea. I look forward to having them out again next year (or maybe sooner).<//Review>

My 3rd time working with Mr Sparkle; all staff are routinely on time, courteous, efficient and do exactly what was promised.  This time it was cleaning rooftop solar panels, badly needed after 2+ years (including ash-fall from 2020 wildfires). Thanks, Mr. Sparkle!!</review>

<Review>Mr. Sparkle completed these services at my home. They power washed the eaves. They also cleaned our window screens with the windows. They were highly professional and friendly and used COVID-19 safety practices. I’d like to have them back once a year. Highly recommended.< /Review>< pictures>

Mr Sparkle was great!  I wanted our porch power washed. They sent someone out to give me a quote and contacted me right away.  We set up an appointment for them to do the job.  Both of these times I was at work and did not need to be there.  Once everything dried, I noticed some areas that didn't come clean.  Mr Sparkle came back out and redid the area. They were extremely professional, easy to work with and very reasonably priced.  I would definitely use them again.  Thanks Mr Sparkle!< /review>

We needed to get our windows cleaned, so I sent out a bunch of quote requests.  Mr. Sparke Services contacted us right away and found a time that would work with our tight schedule. The cleaners came and cleaned the windows beautifully…we are very happy with their work. They were also very reasonably priced.  We'll definitely be calling them again and hopefully cleaning our windows more often now that we found them!< /Review>

<Time>1577642582298</Time><text>I'm a Realtor and I can always count on Mr. Sparkle to get windows sparkling clean, which makes homes more attractive and ready for sale. I also used their gutter-cleaning service recently as a closing gift for homeowners who bought a house with a huge tree in the yard. One less thing for the new homeowners to worry about at a very reasonable price!< /text><Gmap_id>0x808f87bcef34e07f:0x3c47faa6e7c7557a< /Gmap_id></record>

Mr. Sparkle is Great! Very easy and positive experience, from booking the appointment with helpful office staff; to obtaining a very reasonable estimate; to getting the job done. Well trained, professional crew, we just had our windows done by them for the second time. The first time, we needed our window screens replaced, and they took care of that too. This time, we didn't need a second estimate, as they had our home specs on file. They simply deducted the cost of screen replacement. It was a different crew from the first time, and I can say that all of the Mr. Sparkle staff and window techs we've encountered have been very polite, punctual, thorough, and efficient. I warn you though, after a deep professional window cleaning, you are going to notice every speck of dust in your home, so get the dust buster and rags out, LOL. It really does "open" your home and give you a new and positive feeling, one that will make you sure to go for it again. Thank you, Mr. Sparkle: Let There Be Light!< /Text>

Had a great first experience with the Mr. Sparkle crew. They were running a little behind and called to let me know. Very professional and great attention to detail, courteous and mindful for the interior space. I had 16 windows with screens to clean and was very happy with the end result. Of course it rained that day but the windows never looked better!< /Review>

Mr. Sparkle did a fantastic job washing all of our windows, screens, sky lights and solar panels. Everything is shiny and new - I feel like I just moved in! Mr. Sparkle was recommended to me by a friend, and I will be sure to recommend them to my other friends. They showed up on time and worked thoroughly through the house. We have many windows that are up high and hard to reach, so they told me they would need to clean them with a sprayer. To be honest, they look just as clean as the ones they did by hand. I am a very satisfied customer, and know where I will go for future window cleanings - Mr. Sparkle!</review>

Mr.  Sparkle has been cleaning our windows for quite a long time. As they have grown they continue to offer great service, unlike many businesses which grow too big to offer the original good things which helped grow the business in the first place. Organized, neat, easy to communicate with- all good.<//review>

I loved the responsive, professional nature of this business!  They clearly wanted to work with me, and were helpful in terms of the estimate and planning the service.  Minus one star because credit card payment included a fee (?!)... time to update your payment services Mr Sparkle.  I don't have checks or cash on me very often - mostly because every other business easily processes credit cards!< /Text>

<Text>Windows throughout our two-story Craftsmen house came out "sparkly." And our windows were pretty bad! The window washer was pleasant and professional. I would suggest asking if the company will be sending one or two (or more) window washers. We were told the process would be less than two hours and that two people would be working at our house. Because only one person executed the entire job, it took almost five hours. Still, as I mentioned, the end result was great. The window washer put every screen back in place before leaving. I would recommend.</Text><Rating>5<//Rating><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Name>Diana McRae<//Name></record>

Our windows are as clean and perfect as I've ever seen them and the window cleaners (two) who came to our home were respectful, thorough, professional and efficient!

Not only did I end up with clean windows, but I got an explanation of the status of damage and wear and/or tear to each window. I just purchased this home, and the information was invaluable. These guys know windows and take pride in their work, deservedly do. Sparkle on!!</review>

I've used Mr. Sparkle to wash my windows and hang my Christmas tree decorations for at least the last five years.  I have a two story house set on a hill so this is no easy task.  I keep going back to them as they are SO amazing to work with. The people are friendly and go the extra mile to make sure things are done properly.  The quality of work is excellent and the pricing is fair.  I definitely recommend this company to anyone seeking window washing!< /text>

I was impressed with the service I received from Mr Sparkle. First of all the person who answers the phone is super nice. He told me I could expect a quote in two to three days and sure enough that happened. Scheduling an appointment was fast and easy and the gutter cleaners showed up on time. They did the worked beautifully and cleaned everything up, no mess anywhere. I thought the price was very fair and actually thought it would be higher. So yes, I recommend Mr Sparkle!<//review>

The two young men from Mr. Sparkle who recently cleaned my windows were wonderful. They got clarification when needed but for the most part worked independently.  The lead helped with some internal door windows. I seem to never be able to get the clean, clear look that the Mr Sparkle team does. I love having my clean windows.</Text>

<Review>Great service! They were professional, fast, and did a great job cleaning out the gutters on our roof. The people who came to do the work and the staff setting up my invoice and appointment time were very friendly, communicative and a pleasure to work with. I will definitely use them in the future.</Review>< Pictures>

They were easy to communicate with, showed up on time, and did a fantastic job.  Someone came over and asked if I'd had my house painted or something.... it is truly sparkling.  So happy.  Won't wait so long to do it again.<//text>

<Text>The crew was professional and exceeded my expectations.  Their attention to detail was amazing and now we can see so much more through our windows.  They also helped clear debris off the top of a roof drainage downspout.  We will definitely call them again next year.

I hate housework!  But I love it when everything is clean.  Mr Sparkle does the windows for both my home and business.  As a company, Mr Sparkle is super easy to work with.  My office is on a regular schedule, and my home is more seasonal.  both services are easy to book.  The crews are always professional and polite, the rates are fair.< /text>

<Text>My experience with Mr. Sparkle was excellent. The person who came out to do the estimate was friendly, quick, and competent, as were the workers who did the job. Turn around time was exemplary -- from my contact to them to completion of the job was 3 or 4 days! They cleaned my gutters and my windows and I am very satisfied with their service.< /Text></record>

Two very professional workers showed up on time and worked very quickly and quietly. They did a wonderful job on windows that had not been cleaned for a very long time and were filthy. The windows truly sparkle now and I won't hesitate to call them again. The price was reasonable.<//text>

Mr. Sparkle was responsive from beginning to end. I sent a quote request online and they responded the next biz day by email and phone with friendly service.  The crew came out on time and did a very nice job of my exterior windows. I could see that they were attentive and thorough, and also very fast. It took the team of two less than one hour and even asked if we wanted to inspect their work before they left. Overall, it was a very smooth, professional, friendly and positive experience and our windows do sparkle. They are so nice and clean. What a difference. I highly recommend Mr. Sparkel for your home or biz windows.</Review>

Mr. Sparkle Cleaners was reliable, followed up on a schedule change, responsible and on time. The two men who came to clean were polite, accommodating, and did an excellent job, and even helped me remove some very, very hard to reach cobwebs In our 15 foot tall entryway. They cleaned our garage window so well it looks like we can eat off the sill. I highly recommend their services and will use them again.<//text>

<review>I've used Mr Sparkle for three years. They come and clean the gutters and, if needed, do some gutter and down-spout adjustment or repair. They always do a great job, the workers are super nice, and the price is right! Last year, a friend suggested that I need another down spout installed, but Mr Sparkle came and looked at it and said that they though that I just need the gutter cleaned. They were right and water stopped dripping on to my back stairs. They won't recommend work that doesn't really need to be done. 5 stars! Also, when I came home from work today, not only had they cleaned up the leaves that were cleaned out of the gutter, but they swept my entire front walk!< /review>< pictures>

July 2016 - this was the 2nd time I used Mr Sparkle and am very happy again! I used them 2 years ago and at least one of the guys was the same. Nice to know they keep employees year over year - gives me confidence they know what they are doing. Very considerate while working inside the house. Definitely had a great experience!<//Review>

< review>
As an East Bay realtor, I have now used Mr. Sparkle to clean windows on four houses I was preparing for the market. They are unfailingly polite, responsive, thorough and clean (they wear booties in the house).  They get to work immediately and do an excellent job not only cleaning windows and skylights inside and out, but they clean the tracks, screens, and gutters.  I recommend them wholeheartedly and will continue to use them.</review>

<Review>As a Realtor with high standards, I only work with the best I can find in the business when it comes to vendors for clients. Mr Sparkle is simply the best there is and their customer service is and has always been exemplary.
I've worked with Mr Sparkle many many times and I love when my listings have that beautiful finish of professionally cleaned windows, gutters, and more.< /Review>< time>

Good experience with Mr. Sparkle. They are fast and polite. But seeing how easily they clean a window makes me think I should do it myself.</Text>

<Review>I was super happy with the work they did on my 2 story Berkeley home.
we have a lot of windows throughout the house : large glass panels, 5 skylights, roof triangle windows, and may be 15 windows throughout.
they were efficient, and cleaned up after their work.  i would highly recommend them.< /Review>< Date>

<Text>Mr. Sparkle is first-rate. I made my appt. a month in advance because I know they're popular. They came on time and knew exactly how to approach my three-story house on a hill, with windows other window-washers either refused to wash or charged a very high price to reach with ladders. Mr. Sparkle's guys figured out that the windows can be released and washed, without having to reach them from the outside. They also did reach the highest skylight-type windows with ladders inside. They were professional and fast. They also cleaned the gutters, bagged up all the leaves and needles, placed them in our green barrel, and washed the gutters. They are the best. It's so great to be able to see out again!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I'm embarrassed to say that the last time I used Mr. Sparkle was 6 years ago so my windows were really bad.  The few times it rained we couldn't really tell if it was raining.  Mr. Sparkle to the rescue !  The two employees were on time, pleasant, put liners over the soles of their shoes, and did an incredible job.  If they noticed there were any streaks they took out their ladder and cleaned the windows again.  We have also used Mr. Sparkle to clean our gutters.  I highly endorse this company.  You will be more than satisfied.< /Review>

I am a stager. I needed windows done for a large house and got them recommended by one of the realtors I work with regularly. They scheduled it quickly and did a very good job on a very dirty set of windows!  Also, I had to have the house cleaner come in before them due to timing issues and she was afraid they would make a mess of her floors - they did not, everything was beautiful! the pricing also seemed very reasonable, though I honestly had nothing to compare it to. I would definitely recommend.</Review>

Today, I had to go to the store because my phone needed a new sim card. When I arrived at 10:15 am the store was already busy. There were only two ATT store associates working. I was told there was a wait of 30 to 45 minutes  because there were 2 people ahead of me and I understood. As time passed more customers started coming in. They put their names on the waitlist and looked for a spot in the store to wait. We were all in the store waiting while keeping social distance. Soon around 11 am another employee came in. All, including myself, felt as if reinforcements had arrived. After being in the back for a few minutes, he came out and asked all the costumers that were waiting in the lobby to step outside to maintain social distancing. I stepped outside with the others, most of which were visibly/and verbally upset about being asked to step outside after waiting so long.

I was not upset about being asked to step outside, due to the current circumstances I understood, what upset me today was that after waiting for an hour the new assoctiate that had arrived was on his phone and playing with the TV they have up for promotion.

I watched him for 15 minutes while he killed time before I approached him to ask how long until they would help me. He said another 25 minutes so I replied, "HOW COME YOU'RE NOT HELPING THE PEOPLE WAITING?" His response, "I'M THE MANAGER AND I HAVE OTHER THINGS TO DO." So I said, "I'M A MANAGER TOO AND IN OUR PERSPECTIVE IT LOOKS WRONG THAT YOU'RE OUT HERE AND NOT HELPING." He replied, "I UNDERSTAND". But still did nothing.

It took another 45 minutes for someone to finally help me since the manager wasn't assisting with customers at all.

While the associate was helping me, I went and asked the manager for his regional manager's email and he said he couldn not give it to me. So I asked for the manager's business card. He then gave me someone else's business card and he handwrote his name on the card with a personal Gmail email address.

I'm assuming that ATT has their own domain for email accounts for their employees and do not use Gmail. The company I work for has it's own email domain. What upsets me is that the person that is supposed to be in charge and help his employees was too lazy or not smart enough to go hide in the back instead of playing with the TV and texting while you have a full store of people that need help. I've been a costumer of ATT for over 10 years and I have never met someone so unprofessional. So to summarize I had to wait 2 hours for a Sim card because the manager couldn't help his associates with the line of customers out the door if he would have helped he could of cut my time in half.<//Text>< Pics>

We had a great experience here. The people working here were very attentive and helpful. Haru, the young man who worked with us, went the extra mile to set up our phones. Couldn't ask for better service.< /text>

< Review>
I was having a phone issue and while it turned out to be an Apple issue and not an ATT issue, Gabriel and his associates were extremely patient and so helpful in trying to solve the issue when Apple sent me back to ATT twice. Third time was the charm and Apple apologized and fixed the rare issue, but I appreciated your staff for trying their best to help out!!< /Review>

Excellent experience, Robert was amazing, efficient and took care of everything in a great amount of time. Made the buying experience the most enjoyable I’ve had in a while. He is a great asset to the company, and I would be thrilled to have someone like on my team. I’d highly recommend this store to anyone and everyone.<//text>

I visited my local AT&T store to purchase a new phone. I worked Erick and he was extremely helpful. He explained everything clearly and helped us get the best deal on the phone and our service. When I had trouble getting my email on the new phone I returned today and he figured it all out and I am good to go. I feel like I can come here with any problem and get it resolved with great service. Highly recommend!< /review>

Associate Corina helped me a lot and was able to switch me from old carrier to At&t within like only 20 minutes. I was able to keep the same number and utilize eSim feature on my iPhone.
I think it is amazing. Store overall was pretty neat and they had usb ports integrated in seats so you can charge your phone while waiting.
10/10 would recommend to friends.</Text>

Let me start by saying that I’ve followed Haru since he was at another local AT&T store.  He is an amazing  rep/associate.  I wish all reps had his professionalism, courteous and contagious positive attitude. I will definitely be coming back to your store.< /Review><Response>{'time': 1617638171605, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback!'}<//Response><user_name>R Avila<//user_name><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

<text>Haru assisted me with resolving a total headache from dealing with the AT&T call center. There is nothing like dealing with a person face to face. He was kind, empathetic and warm hearted. He was in front with all details and resolved my billing issues. We for sure come in person going forward.<//text>< pics>

Haru was incredible    My husband and I came into the ATT store and purchased 2 new phones
He was not the person who sold them to us but when things went bad trying to transfer our information to our new phones he was the hero who so nicely saved the day 2x’s   We are now up and running with our new phones and happy to have mee one of ATT’s  best employees

THANK YOU Haru< /review>

I was in the store today for help with a new iPhone 12 and I had questions about 5G speeds. Eugene and the manager were absolutely fantastic helped me move my business to a 5G plan and in fact we saved 20 bucks a month. I do appreciate having people who are local and very knowledgeable about their product and service and a big plus to be a satisfied AT&T customer</review>

I went to The Valencia Store this morning and i must say they have the best customer service. I had my appt scheduled and was helped by GG. I can’t say enough about his customer service. He explained my new plan, walked me thru every process and made sure that all my questions were answer before I left the store. I would highly recommend this store location based on the cleanliness, customer service and great employees! Thank You GG for making my experience a great one!!!!! Check them out for all your Att services< /Review>

Originally I had an appointment at another at&t store but it was cancelled without notification. When I arrived at this location and informed the staff of my frustration, manager Jonathan immediately put me through the queue according my original appointment time and had one of his wonderful associates, Corina, help me with my account.  I truly appreciate the attention and customer experience this location offered. Thank you.</text>

<Name>Helen Abdulhai<//Name><time>1602034283332</time><Rating>5</Rating><text>Just a little back story I was ready to quit AT&T and leave to another carrier because customer care over the phone was not helpful at all but I decided to give it a shot. Came to the store and when I saw how long the line was I almost gave up but I was already there so why not. When I put my name down the manager, Gabe, asked me to explain my reason for the visit and I let him know that my phone has been blotchy with connections. He showed me how to reset some network stuff in my phone and sure enough it now works. Told him how bad my calls with their customer service has been and he openly listened and gave me some great tips through the app. This store is a little further than the smaller one next to my house but after this visit I’ll only be coming here.</text>< pictures>

Sadia absolutely was a 10/10! She is unbelievably amazing. She was so helpful & knowledgeable . She made my switch from android to iPhone so easy. I was worried about switching because I’ve always had an Android but she was able to answer all my questions. Not only was she knowledgeable, she was so kind and fun during the whole process. I’ve always been with AT&T and let me tell you Sadia hands down is my FAVORITE.<//Text>

Thank you Sophia for all of your help!! We came in to the store to upgrade our phones and we walked out with new phones, explanations and a q & a session to understand them!  In addition to what we went for, we were upgraded to a better plan for a lower price, and a  few accessories!  Excellent experience!</Review>

Went to this location for assistance in setting up my iPhone.  I was greeted by my sales rep GG exactly at my appointment time.  He was very helpful, explaining the process and walking me through it until it was completed.  The store staff has taken careful consideration to COVID protocol.  Overall a very pleasant experience< /Review>

Very horrible service yesterday Luise kept me for 25 minutes collecting data form me then went inside said we don’t have the phone. Because I declined to by protection warranty, financing the phone etc .
The management needs restructuring. This does not represent the integrity of AT&T< /Text>

<review>Robert was great! But their customer service as far as AT&T goes is awful they had people waiting outside in the horrible heat it took us 1 hr to be seen the manager was a jerk. There were 3 associates working on a holiday weekend. They should've at least let people stand in side 6 ft apart but they didn't.  They should've given cold water for the people standing outside.  A woman made an appt in the phone so she didn't have to wait but the made her wait anyway so don't bother making an appt its BS if you can go to another cell phone company!!!</review>< rating>

I got helped today by Javier and was astounded by the customer service he provided. He was knowledgeable and professional plus helped me with all my questions and things needed for my cell phone. I previous went to a store in sylmar and felt bullied by the manager and didn’t feel welcome but at this location I felt comfortable and will definitely be coming back to this location even though it’s further away. The environment or atmosphere provided by all the employees was so wonderful to feel. They know their stuff and are happy to help.< /Review>

<Text>Yesterday I had an appointment at the Valencia, CA AT&T store without my cell phone working.  I walked in on time and Erick Medrano was waiting for me so I had no 'wait' time.  I has been trying for almost two weeks to have AT&T solve my number being stolen by a "port out" scam (a real horror). No one was able to help me within AT&T after numerous calls and endless hours of pure frustration.
Erick did help me with some added help from the assistant store manager, Jonathan Bergman.  These gentlemen had solutions for me that no one within AT&T corporate structure even suggested.  I was out of the store within twenty minutes with my cell phone working!
Utter professionals and very pleasant people to work with and they changed my most negative impression of AT&T to a very positive one.
My deepest thanks to Erick and Jonathan for a job exceptionally well done.< /Text></record>

Best At&T experience ever! Sophia was SO knowledgeable, so helpful, so very excellent in every way. We had some technical complications and she did a great job of working things out. We upgraded phones and she was amazing at explaining options, possibilities, and all the costs involved. Really appreciate the great customer service here!< /text>

<Text>Long wait outside in the heat per COVID-19  protocol was observed. They have no control over that situation. But still annoying.
This all changed the moment I was called in by Eugene, the sales rep. He was very professional and apologized for the delay in seeing me even though it not his doing.
He answered all my questions, even told me where to find things, passwords and mail accounts.
For the first time without my children, I got all things done without any frustration.
Eugene was excellent today.</Text>< response>

Erick is the best ever AT&T Rep!  He makes us loyal AT&T members!  More reps should be like Erick!  No joke, he helped figure out all our issues and had suggestions to fix everything.  We could not ask for a better AT&T rep!  Awesome service and so very friendly & courteous too!<//review>

Waited over thirty minutes. The Rep that was supposed to help me left sick just as I was walking in. The new Rep was supposed to switch my number over and was supposed to take my bank info to set up direct pay....never did either of those ...got urgent texts went into the office ...the rep taking the names for place in line was rude...tried explaining what happened and it wasn't my error...he basically told me it wasn't his problem and that I need to go get inline and wait 40 minutes for their error...I left frustrated and still can't use my phone!! And she never told me how much my bill was going to be.  ..horrible service all three times of going in...I was already nervous about spending almost $1,500 on a phone and switching providers since I've been with the one I had for about 12 years...this didn't help<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Erick & Edberg were exceptional! I have several different services with AT&T, wireless, business landlines, Internet...etc. I wanted to see if there was a way to consolidate me accounts and lower our costs as we have been deeply impacted by the COVID-19 situation.

They were patient and demonstrated that they really cared about creating a solution for me. The solution they put together was a huge help as it reduced our costs while solving the many challenges to make sure our business would still run as smoothly as possible.

They are excellent representatives for AT&T!</Review>< Pics>

I found the agent to be very helpful very pleasant very knowledgeable. He took his time and make sure we understood the phone the program and the process. It’s refreshing to know that people still care about good customer service and we were very pleased as you can tell in our ratingGood job AT&T for hiring people even though they’re on commission it at a time for you as a customer. Thumbs up I’m very satisfied and will do it again if I need to with the same age and thank you for the courtesy<//text>

I'm very grateful for this essential store's continued service during the difficult time we're facing at the moment. Valencia was the only store to have the red new Apple Fruity Phone SE in stock. I opted for the walk-in service instead of curbside because I also needed to purchase an eSIM for my phone. Robert Flores the sales associate helped me process my pickup, and even offered me additional products and services for my order, all while making the process as seamless as possible. All sales associates and managers were following health code guidelines, and they even had bottles of Purell in the store for both employees and customers. THANK YOU for your service, well done!</text>

It wasn't like that at all.  I was helped by Robert who was very personable, helpful, and patient.  I told him exactly what I needed and he delivered.  I didn't feel ripped off or scammed at all.  Extra points for remembering things I mentioned throughout our conversation.  I highly recommend if anyone needs anything from an ATT store to head to this location and ask for him.  The manager was very nice and helpful, too.<//review>< Pictures>

<userid>103247757178710446430< /userid><review>There so much to say about the class act known as AT&T manager Edward and AT&T representative Eugene. Firstly my husband is a first responder and a veteran.  We encountered problems activating 3 new phones so we had to visit this AT&T  location.  Subsequently, we returned for  assistance to help  Us activate  a  complimentary HBO on our phones. Upon our third and final visit these gentlemen showed my husband such incredible respect for  doing his job as a  first responder as well as a veteran  . They literally explained how AT&T held first responders in high regard,, as well as veterans, they upgraded him to a first responder program called First Net. No one had bothered to  even mention this program, nor take the time to advocate the positives  to us. Yet these two ,patiently explained the how’s and why’s  to us and  answered  the same repeat questions more than a few times. We feel especially grateful to have  their help and acknowledgment for his  work . Just outstanding  !! This kind of special consumer attention  is so wonderful to experience  during This difficult time in our country  and world. AT&T you could really  use a few dozen more individuals just like them!!

I had previously provided a review praising GG. However, 6 weeks later I must change that review.  He recommended a different plan for me that was to save me money but it didn't. It caused me to lose the employee discount (which he knew I had) and my mobility bill went up substantially! Then today, I find out it has also impacted my Uverse plan!  I am so mad and I am on week 3 of trying to resolve this. Shame on you GG!<//Review>

<Text>I had THE best At&t customer service from this store. My father is NOT the easiest person to communicate with and GG handled him wonderfully. He was so very patient with all of my dads questions, as well as listened to all of my dads wacky stories. Even between all of this; GG managed to teach him a thing or two about his new iPhone, something I myself could never do lol My father left alot more confident and knowledgeable about his phone and its all thanks to GG.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c2873e7a050e67:0xe6c32971d4154402<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

System failed to transfer all the lines and left one of line in my brother's account.  I have called customer care 3 times, Loyality team & also reached out to AT&T's twitter page & no one is able to resolve it stating system's issue.  So i have decided to walk up to the store and Corina and Edberg did the magic.  They fixed the issue in 10 mins and I am all set.  Their customer service is amazing and carefully listened to the issue that i am facing and helped in resolving.  Great work !<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<review>I bought a new smart watch online and due to some weird glitch on the backside of things, it was not syncing with my phone. After spending over an hour on the phone with tech support on more than 1 occasion, I decided to go into the store. Sophia and Courtney were so paitent and helpful trying to fix the glitch and setup the watch for me. They truly showed what customer service should be. They also told me about a promotion (which the techs I spoke with over the phone never mentioned) and I was able to get my husband a smart watch for free! They are fast, efficient, and all of the employees are courteous. Even with my kids being loud and overactive! This store is definitely the best in  SCV. . I highly recommend this store.<//review><Time>1581885883333< /Time></record></dataset><record>

GG did an amazing job at helping my husband figure out what was wrong with his iPhone. At first we couldn’t hear on speaker nor microphone, we did a hard reset then everything was back to normal. We left the store, went to the mall and I told my husband to give me a call just in case and sure enough —his speaker and microphone weren’t working. So we came back to ATT and GG helped us again, this time we decided to upgrade my husbands iPhone. He was great to work with!<//Text>

Had a great experience with GG at At&T in Valencia. Very patient and thorough with information on my phone. Furthermore,  the Samsung rep Ariel did well in explaining the new features with the Samsung s20+.< /review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>GG was so helpful and efficient. We walked in originally looking for a replacement iPhone for my phone line and he managed to fix our account to update not only my phone but my brothers as well and we still saved money on our monthly bill. Hooked us up with a special deal on accessories too so now I’ve got full damage protection on my new phone and a swanky new charging pad. The experience before coming in store was frustrating to say the least because of all the hoops the representative made me jump through just to check in store stock. As soon as GG started with us in store I immediately felt better and he successfully turned my original interaction that honestly would have resulted in me filing a complaint for the phone representative into one of the best experiences I’ve had at any AT&T location ever. THANK YOU AGAIN SO MUCH GG! You rock!!< /Review>< Pics>

This store processed my switch from Verizon to AT&T. Ever since I've been having all kinds of connectivity issues in areas where my phone used to work just fine. The worst part is that my picture messaging stopped working all together. Not a single picture is going through. Not from me, not to me.<//Review>

< review>
I came in with my wife to add a cell line. We decided to add internet as well. Salesman said if we added basic tv we would save even more and the tv would be free. Well a $164 tv internet bill showed up and $124 of it is from the tv. Also so far our 100mb internet line is topping out at 50-60mb at most, But when it was Spectrum we ran 100-110mb constantly. Not a happy consumer.< /review>

<rating>1<//rating><text>I'm not sure what was going on here today, but the way we were treated was very strange. When we walked in, an employee came up to us and stared at us, but there was no 'Hello' or 'Welcome' or 'What can I help you with today?' Just staring. That was strange enough, but when we told them we wanted to port over our numbers from Cricket, they told us they couldn't do it, and maybe we can try calling customer service. No other offers of help. They also seemed like they weren't sure what the rules were.

We left confused, called the other store on Bouquet Canyon, and went there. Two hours later, we walked out with new plans, new phones, and even a new internet plan, with all the promotions we could ask for. Our issue of porting numbers was still difficult because of subsidary complications, but the rep helped us figure out the best way to go about things. The Bouquet Canyon store was a wonderful experience. The Valencia Crossroads store seemed like the whole staff had quit last week, and they hired all new people who didn't know why they were there and had never worked customer service before.</text>< pictures>

<Review>Andre is the man. Walked in. Greeting immediately. Maybe one other customer there.  Told Andre I wanted to upgrade my Galaxy S5 to S6.  Told Andre I wanted a clear case so I can see this beauty and he found one quick, suggested a glass screen protector and I agreed and within 15-20 min I was all ready to go.  Thanks Andre.

I went in and spoke with Esbeidy D. about buying a new phone for my elderly father. I asked her multiple times if I could upgrade the phone without activating it since I wanted to be able to program it before I gave it to him. She responded multiple times that she could do that. She didn't. In the afternoon his current phone was no longer working, and when I called AT&T I was told that they had activated the new phone and there was nothing they could do. I was told I could go buy a new sim card. When I called and spoke to the store manager his response was that "she was usually very good."</Review>

Bad customer service. Mgr Melanie and Andre are giving wrong information to the customers. Definitely not coming back to this store.

Att need to educate their staff so they will not misinform the customers!

Called and left a message but no one get back to you. You have to call them back and complain before they will take care of you. You can't find a good customer service from this store at all.< /Text>

I returned on Monday and gracis Eugenio could solve satisfactorily. Thanks Eugenio has 5 Stars.
