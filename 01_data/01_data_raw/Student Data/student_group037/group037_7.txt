<text>I called Hague this morning about 8am. Told him I do not have any water pressure it took me 45 minutes to shower and I ended up having to rinse my hair with a gallon of water that I had saved for the dogs. They said they were extremely busy but would try and work me in it would have to be between two and five today. I got home at 1:45 Dominic showed up a few minutes after two went down and looked at the unit unfortunately can’t be saved but I have water now because he bypassed the unit and I am using strictly well water. Very professional service very nice young man and the fact that they came out the same day I called was phenomenal</text><Name>Vicki Miller< /Name>< Time>

This company is amazing the level of skill and care was evident from the first interaction.  The water system is excellent our water tastes fresh and pure and my skin is so soft now.   I highly recommended Bert and his guys.   As a side note they went above and beyond to help us and it showed their true character.  Thank you Bert and team💗<//Review>

<text>Our initial contact with Brett and Bert at Hague Quality Water was very good. They arrived on time for a very informative, relaxed and convincing presentation about the company and what they could do for us. The installation went very smoothly and then I waited to experience the advantages of soft water. After about two weeks, I can say that their promises were kept and we love our new water system. I would definately recommend Hague Quality Water to anyone interested in improving their water quality</text>< Date>

Jordan and Dom were here on time and did a great job. When they finished, Jordan explained what I needed to know and after almost a month, I’m very satisfied with my soft water system. I definitely recommend this family run company in San Diego and their Hague water softener system.</Text>

Prompt service and completely reasonable pricing. We shopped three other big name companies in San Diego to install a simple water softener, replacing one that was already plumbed. One nameless company actually had the gall to quote $2,500 to put it in an $1,800 softener. The job literally only took 2 hours. Hague was great, did great work cleaned up and were done within the two hours. They also communicated throughout the process. They are highly recommended<//Text>

<review>We recently had 2 Flo by Moen Water Valves installed on our house. We were very please with the installation process, the instructions we received on how to monitor the units, and the overall cost. Everyone we dealt with was very professional. I would highly recommend Hague Quality Water if you are considering the installation of the Flo by Moen Water Valves. We have already found a leak in our irrigation that we were able to detect and fix.< /review></record>

<review>Hague provided expert water purification counsel regarding my Julian well that is heavy in iron. I decided to buy a unit that purifies the water coming into the house. I opted to work with Hague over Culligan after I learned the business specializes in well water and has been providing services to the Julian community for many decades. I felt valued and appreciated. I trusted Brett Hague. The customer service was outstanding.</review>< pictures>

From Bert to Brett to Jordan, I've had nothing but good experiences.  They are courteous, respectful, thorough and pleasant.  The take time to explain things.  They work quickly.  They communicate VERY well their intentions, especially ETAs and, most importantly, they ARE their word.  I had a question about whether a service that was done was working; they were genuinely concerned about MY concern and made arrangements to get out quickly to do follow-up.  VERY Professional.  They're the best.  As a business owner myself, I am happy that I've got Hague Quality Water to take care of me the way I take care of my customers, as I would want it for myself.</Text>

Brett from Hague Quality Water came to my home to service my WATTS RO System.  He was very polite, professional and friendly.  While Brett was working he patiently explained possible problems with my old current system and how it should be maintained. He quoted me prices for future upgrades which I had requested. Fortunately, my tank just needed to be re- pressurized and system is presently working fine.

I would definitely recommend Hague Quality Water for service on reverse osmosis systems .< /Review>

It is amazing having a family owned business here in the community that cares about quality of service. We had a terrible water volume and discoloration problem.  The Huff's came out to troubleshoot and what was amazing, at no charge. Now that is customer service.

Brett noticed our system wasn't regenerating and got it working, with recommendations to frequently regenerate the system to unclog the system of the debris that had accumulated. Simply put this saved us from having to re-bed or buy a new unit.

He also suggested being on a well in our location, with so much Iron and manganese in the water, that we should have an Iron filter in front of our system. Which we invested in.  Bret re-piped everything from the main inlet pipe forward.  Very professionally done.  You can tell he takes extreme care to take the time and do the job right. They take great pride in their work and it is evident in the results, our water volume is up and the coloration is clear.

We would recommend Hague and the Huff's to anyone wanting to improve their water quality situation.<//Review>

Hague provided us with excellent service.  I will definitely recommend this company.   I know that their product actually works after having a Culligan system that did not work and ruined our faucets and appliances. Don't use Culligan for your well water.  Use Hague.  You won't be disappointed.   I reached out on Facebook for a company that specialized in well water and someone  recommended them.  I can honestly say I no longer have spots on my glass shower doors and there is no calcium build up on my faucets.  Thank you Hague for your outstanding service.</review>

We have installed two water purification systems with Hague, one for our tasting room and one for our home.  We are on a well and there systems have vastly improved our water quality.  The jobs were done on time and completed as promised.< /Review>

Excellent customer service, knowledgeable and professional. Jordan and Bert spent time answering ALL of our questions.  With so many water softener and filtration companies / options it was important for us to understand just what set Hague Water systems apart from the others.  Once we chose to work with Hague, they fit us in for an install and completed the job in less time than planned as well as kept the spaces they worked in very clean and neat.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!<//review>

Very refreshing experience.  The people were punctual, did fabulous work installing both the RO and the softener and didn’t run off until they shared the operation and what we need to do to maintain the systems.  They also answered all our questions.  Great experience and we anticipate the great experience will continue.   Thanks Hague!< /Text>

Hague Quality Water quickly got back to me and same day was able to come over and give me a quote for a whole house filter/softener systems. Took time to go over every type of system (pro/cons/prices) and arranged installation within a week. Price was cheaper than most and explained how there quality was better than conventional whole house systems. Hague as a company manufactures there own systems instead of resale other manufacturers system. They also have a 25 year warranty depending on what system you get.

Family owned business that very friendly, upfront on everything, and took the extra step on everything from aesthetics to covering shoes when entering my house. Even the estimated time of installation was met.

Highly recommend them.< /review>

We recently moved and wanted to change our reverse osmosis system that was a different company to Hague. We’ve used them in the past with our other house and had such a great experience that we had to have their product again. I trust everything that comes out of the water tap now and their staff is so knowledgeable. I know that I can call Bert and he’ll call back quickly!!!</review>

<name>Richard McInnis< /name><Date>1584557374563</Date><rating>5< /rating><text>Had several estimates and the systems may sound the same from different dealers but the fine print shows the peace of mind of having a 25 year warranty, a system that cleans itself and to top it off....the system notifies you if you have a leak and even shuts off. This not only saves you from water damage but insurance companies love this and offer up discounts on home insurance. As for the customer service and professionalism... this is exactly what I was looking for. They communicated often, were on time, and finished when they said they would finish. Cant ask for more than that. Might not be the cheapest system out there but the quality you get and peace of mind is well worth it. Stop looking for a company to choose and go with Hague!<//text>< Pics>

<rating>5</rating><review>Bert is personable, but more important, he is extremely knowledgeable and honest. Very upfront about things. That's appreciated. He went over everything with us: How the system works, what it included, how would be installed, and all of our options as far as the Hague version of a low end water softener vs. Hague version of a high end water softener.

What's we made our decision, Brett and Jordan came out a few days later and installed the system in a few hours. Love the new water!

I've definitely noticed difference in how much shampoo and soap I needed to get suds. You don't realize how much hard water costs you (in all the little ways)until  you get it softened up.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Although the test results identified an iron problem ( colloidal iron) which is expensive and difficult to completely eliminate, Burt offered a more economical approach which he thought would help most of the way and he would provide “at his cost”. He also gave us good instructions and explanations on how to deal and live with the colloidal iron issue. Overall The Hague water system has greatly improved the quality of the water in the house! Prior to having the system, my Mom was having problems with her skin health and after getting the system her problems resolved and her drinking water is amazing!

Bert, Brett, and Jordan were phenomenal from beginning to end. They were extremely patient with us for asking many questions. Most importantly, they are transparent. Everything was explained to us including how they would troubleshoot and fix our problem. The cost was reasonable and they explained the itemized invoice to us at the beginning including possible increases in the cost if certain issues were encountered. There were no surprises and everything they said was upheld. We appreciated the honesty and integrity of their work. They are very friendly and happy to talk and explain. We did not feel they were rushing to complete the job; rather they took the necessary time to get the job done right! We are extremely satisfied customers and would only recommend Hague Quality Water from now on after our poor experience with Rayne Water.< /text>

Hague was flexible with scheduling as I waited for parts delivery.  Jordan arrived on time and efficiently installed a new faucet, then replaced filters and serviced the tank.</Text>

Brett and Jordan came to service my RO unit,they were punctual, efficient and very polite.
They also left some water bottles for us, until the tank filled up.
I will definitely use their service again.< /Text>

I would like to take a moment to say "Thank you" for a job well done. From every angle you exceeded my expectations. Including:

1. Providing a thorough explanation of what exactly was going wrong with the old water treatment system on our well.
2. Why the MaxPack Water Treatment System would be the optimum solution.
3. Product information and data sheet.
4. Offered flexibility in terms of multiple payment options.
5. Timely installation for both the exterior treatment equipment as well as the under sink reverse osmosis equipment in the kitchen.
6. Complete instructions in regards to operations, service & maintenance.

Water quality is better than ever and, most importantly, a very happy wife.

Thank you once again.</Text>

San Mateo Sports Nutrition is by far the best shop. They are super helpful and friendly. They always make sure you walk out of there knowing what you have bought is what you need. Great staff. Great ownership. Great supps. Just by far the best place I’ve ever been when I need things.
Appreciate you guys,</Review>

<text>Jason and Tri are amazing! I have been going to them for years and the care and attention they provide to each customer is what keeps bringing me back. They are very knowledgeable about their products and will definitely help you find what works best for you and your body.

Speaking of their products - The supplements sold here are all top of the line. Depending on what my nutrition and training goals are at any given time, there is always a supplement available to help me achieve my goals.

I guarantee that once you start shopping here, you will no longer need to shop anywhere else for your supplement needs!< /text>< pictures>

<Text>Can't express how great the whole team is at San Mateo Sports Nutrition. Everyone is friendly, supportive and extremely knowledgeable about fitness, dieting and their products and services. I've been a regular at San Mateo Sports Nutrition and the guys are an awesome bunch to talk to about fitness and anything else. On top of that, they regularly let you try samples of new products so that you can test them out for yourself before you come back to buy. Jason and the whole team are awesome!

This place has superior customer service! I’ve been frequenting San Mateo Sports Nutrition & Supplements since their early days. Everyone is professional, friendly, and very knowledgeable. Most times, I’ve work with Jason, one of the owners. I appreciate him taking the time to explain how supplements work within our bodies. Jason will give recommendations for what my husband and I will need. You will not be oversold! The guys at San Mateo Sports Nutrition & Supplements will also be your biggest supporters in whatever fitness path or journey you take. I always appreciate the encouragement to continue with mine!</Text>

Jason also knows his stuff when it comes to competition prep so don’t hesitate to ask his opinions on supplements. He carries top brands in the industry and especially my all time favorite SuperBioFreakOMG by Globalformulas. I’ll see you soon Jason! Stay Hilarious!!!</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I’ve been going here since they were still known as “Max Muscle”. It’s the same staff and owner. Jason, Tri, and Nico have been nothing but informative and helpful. They don’t try to sell you on anything when you’re in the store. They will answer any question you may have and let you decide if that product is best for you. They also ship if you order online or by phone. But if you’re local, I highly suggest you stop by the store and meet the staff. They are all super cool to talk to, especially Jason! You might end up in his IG story too 😅<//review>

This place is awesome - Jason and Tri their know their stuff and will spend as much time with you as you need to answer your questions, whether it's about a particular product or whether it's about a goal you have and the best way for you to get there. Also, they have plenty of samples available - if you're not sure about a product or flavor, odds are they'll have samples available that you can take home and try before you buy. Once you start shopping here  you won't want to go anywhere else. I've been coming here for 10 years, buying supplements and seeking advice, and they've always gone over the top to answer my questions and to help me out.< /Review>

<Review>I have been coming to San Mateo sports nutrition for years now. I stock up on supplements every month or two. I get protein powders, aminos and daily vitamins.This store has everything you need. What I love the most about this store  is how knowledgeable and educated Jason and his employees are.He understands what’s happening on a cellular level when taking supplements or how your body is responding to certain supplements. I also work with coach Nico Abaya for bikini/lifestyle!!! If your in San Mateo stop by!<//Review>< pics>

By far the best nutrition store I've ever been too. This place has TOP NOTCH suppliments and isn't saturated with heavily marketed low quality suppliments like most nutrition places. You'll also find knowledgeable people who not only know their products but also care about health, fitness, body building etc. Highly recommend checking this place whether you're new into the fitness world or you're a competitior<//Review>

Such a gem! If you are in town, stop by and see Jason! Not only is he a super scientist when it comes to nutrition, but he has the biggest heart and smile to match.  Everyone of his customers becomes a friend.  He is happy to hand out samples and may even introduce you to a new supplement or addition to your routine! Plenty of street parking.

SMSN has been my to go shop for all my supplements for 10+ years. They have a wide variety of Pre and post workout supplements, protein, fat burners, healthy candies , cookies , energy drinks , you name it. The best is that they don’t push any supplements to your throat hehe for you to buy it , they give you samples to try first.  Great location, clean store and friendly staff. I totally recommend this shop it’s the Sephora of supplements in San Mateo LOL .< /text>

Tons of options at the store. I'm a total newbie on workout and nutrition and had no clue what I'm doing there, but Jason from the store is so friendly and helpful I don't feel embarrassed to ask all my silly questions.  He is always there to help and never try to oversell anything.
The guy literally remembered my name on my second visit to the store!   How awesome is that ?!<//Review>

The J team knows more than enough about nutrition. Jason makes sure to take care of you, specially if he see’s your progress. Give him a visit if you want to be in the best of shape of your life or to simply get an idea of what it takes to be healthy and fit.<//review>

<Text>I started coming here about 5 months ago, but in the past I’ve always stuck to Costco and GNC for my supplements. I decided to switch over to San Mateo Sports Nutrition because of J and Tri. They don’t only have awesome products, but they also take the time to get to know the people that step foot in the store. I felt welcomed the day I stepped in there. Learned a lot about different supplements while having a real conversation with them! I would highly recommend checking them out, and not to mention get a lot of samples! Thanks for being real in the game J & Tri!<//Text>< GmapID>

<Text>Have been following San Mateo Sports Nutrition for a couple years now and have to say Jason’s knowledgeable humor and stories on IG really caught my attention.. I currently live in Solano County and well decided to take the drive to visit the store in person and must sat I was not disappointed..Jason is very kind and knowledgeable.. Definitely a genuine one of a kind guy..Ultimate customer service.
Love all the products and never disappoints with the supplements he recommends to achieve my goals weather just to be healthy or have weight loss goals or overall wellness  💪🏼 The drive is definitely worth it and will recommend to anyone looking for those ultimate goals and in need of understanding a product or supplement they may be in doubt of.. 10/10<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x808f9e701407724b:0x56e1305604cab5c8< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Of course you can go buy supplements online, but with the variety of flavors and ingredients come shop at a place that has the best interest for you.

I called ahead to get a inBody evaluation. Jason answered and he was so helpful and friendly. Upon entering the store, I was met with the same enthusiasm!

I will make the hike from Santa Cruz just to experience the fun and upbeat atmosphere.</Review>

Ok, this is one brick and mortar store that I don't taking the time to walk into.

I've always bought my supplements online. My coach (Coach Drew of CrossFit Burlingame) recommended a few items and this store. Decided to take a walk there, instead of ordering online and I'm happy I did.

Jason was very attentive, walking me through all the benefits of the items I was purchasing. He gave me details about how to use them also. I'll definitely be heading here for my supplements purchases from now on.<//Review>

So, initially I found about this place through Instagram because of their weekly giveaway contests. Week after week I played and finally won! When I went in, the owner was helping out a family but made sure to welcome me as soon as I came in. I work for 24 Hour Fitness and am around supplements all the time, but I am always wanting to learn more about supplements. I walked in and was able to choose between liquid l-carnitine or cleanse & lean. I chose the l-carnitine, but he opened a bottle of cleanse & lean and still gave me a sample so I could see what that product was all about as well. No pressure at ALL for sales; the owner truly carries out that "there to teach/serve you" customer service style. You walk into a place like GNC and they may offer SOME knowledge but nowhere near to the extent of MAX Muscle and nowhere near as relaxed. The orange zest l-carnitine is delicious and I am definitely returning to get more once this bottle runs out (perfect flavor, not sweet, good concentration, good energy, already-seen results/felt effect). Truly a place of supply, quality, and knowledge... not supply, sales pitch, and pressure.<//text>

They have fast and friendly service. I ordered a Stromboli which I've never had before so I have nothing to compare it to. It's essentially like a pizza inside of baked dough, and like an open hot pocket. I had the one with cheese bacon and sausage and it was pretty good. I think I'll stick with their pepperoni slice next time, it's been my favorite since I was about 5 years old. I can't believe I've been eating Sbarro for 25 years!< /review>

The staff were really nice and friendly. But the food was terrible! My pizza was cold and the ziti was dry and cold as well. I'm very disappointed with my experience.</Text>

It is still Sbarro now known as "La Cucina" which is confusing to me. My daughter loves going there for the pepperoni pizza. I like it, too when I want pizza at anytime when the mall is open.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Enjoying the afternoon watching the boys and girls play the sport they like and at the same time relaxing a bit. Hopefully and soon all people can walk free as before, freedom is very important for human beings, it is the most important thing to be free to live in peace Greetings and thanks

<review>Stopped by the Pure Cycles showroom today to test ride a city bike, great ride and I think the gear options on the hub will be good for moderate-paced commuting. Very friendly service, I was able to contact via email beforehand to ask questions and find a day that worked for my test ride. Thanks for helping me load my new bike into my car!</review><userid>113413436133387955122<//userid>< Pics>

Beautiful bike! I assembled the bike myself because I didn’t have a local bike shop that the company could send it to for assembly. The bike came 90% assembled in the box and the online directions were easy to follow.< /review>

<text>This group appears to be well motivated but clearly our of their element when doing business. They tried to do a crowd funding on indiegogo for the Capacita an ebike. They took our deposits and then strung us along for 2 years. Blamed tariffs and everyone but themselves. Finally they were forced to sell to JBI Bikes and left alot of people hanging. Ended up offerring people a 75% refund.

The lesson: it could have been worse but do not trust them with your money.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2955d266fd33b:0xbb4b409190d6ebf1</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Very much appreciated their prompt and patient over the phone customer service, which made them feel like my neighborhood bike shop from halfway across LA. There was a problem with my gift order and Eric helped resolve it with care and concern as if the bike were for his own friend or family member. Thanks so much for helping save Christmas :)< /Text><rating>5< /rating><username>Whitney Richelle</username>< Date>

Hear me out... I purchased a bike from these guys on Tuesday at midnight and got it Tuesday at 3pm!!! Shipping was sooo fast but there was a problem, the bike came with a ding. Now I know how I could have turned into a typical lazy consumer and just raged on their reviews... but no, they should be given a chance to correct mistakes even if it was out of their hands, I assembled the bike myself and this was clearly a manufacturing glitch. Talked to Traece C. who offered an exchange for the same bike fresh out of the box. They even waited for me to get there!!! And I tried to tip them!! They gave me a discount on steel cages that I bought! They made up for it, love my new bike. Would do it all over again. All this happened in the span of 2 days. Love what you’re doing with cycling, offering reasonable prices bikes that are gonna last me a lifetime. Thank you guys!<//text>

Simple, good looks with very nice components, and the price was right for me.  I am 6'1.5" and I think the large is just the tiniest bit too small for me, but I have been enjoying it for getting around town.  It is a really good looking bike!  I have used it every day.  The people at the store were great and answered questions and chatted.  I will recommend this to friends.  Thanks for being in business.</text>< pictures>

<Text>Ordered my bike online after a friend recommended Pure Cycles to me. The bike arrived super speedy at a local bike shop. They put it together for me and when I came to pick it up they complimented the quality of the bike. It's a sexy bike, fixed gear that also coasts-- perfect for easy rides with my dog in tow.<//Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I was looking for a mid-priced daily driver to use for my commute to work. I had been on several websites and was narrowing down my list. I chose the Pure Cycles drop bar road bike and I have been very happy with the decision. They have been great to deal with, and if you are wanting a bike that makes the ride to work fun and that you aren't afraid to leave outside all day due to how dear the price was, check them out. I'm very happy and would buy from them again.</Text>

Purchased  the Hypo Pure Fix. Ordering was easy. Bike arrived and I assembled it myself using online instructions. I decided upon riding fix gear as opposed to freewheel as I love the connection to the road. Easy to do, just flip the tire. Design is great, bike provides stability for urban roads, and it's fun to ride a fixed gear bike. Bike is easy to maintain yourself. Just a few tools and grease. All can be ordered from Pure Fix.   Great bike for the money.<//Review>

I love my new bike and get stopped all the time with compliments. It is not only a great quality product, but it is so sleek and eye catching - so many cool color options to choose from. The employees are so friendly and helpful and made the buying process so simple - very quick to respond to questions, too. I can't wait to order my children the kids balance bikes!!!! I highly recommend Pure Cycles for all your riding needs - they have everything!!. Go here you won't be sorry.<//Text>

Great products and even greater people!  This is my third bike purchased from Pure Fix / Pure Cycles and the experience working with them could bot be better.

I have now had bikes shipped to New York City and LA and no matter the location, the customer service and delivery has been seamless.  I have referred multiple friends, some that picked up directly from the store, and all have been blown away by the service and product they receive.

I would strongly recommend Pure Cycles to anyone that is in the market for a new bike.< /Review>

<text>I absolutely love my bike. I spent months searching locally & online to find a well-built, aesthetically-pleasing, handy, not-too-heavy cruiser -- this is it! With only 3 gears I won't be taking this on any mountain climbs or anything but it definitely gets me to work, farmer's markets and anywhere else around town comfortably. I LOVE it & highly recommend them.</text><rating>5</rating>< Pictures>

I love Pure Cycles. I've had my bike for 3 years and I have a lot of fun riding it. I was so happy to find out that I could visit the bike shop at their headquarters and I found so many great parts & accessories at their pop up sale. Most bike shops are intimidating and what I love most about Pure Cycles is how inviting and friendly they are.</Review>

I've had the worst experience with my Pure Cycles Volta bike. My battery could not keep a charge so I returned it once for repair.

After I got it returned to me, it worked ok but still was not getting 40 miles of range.

I let the bike site idle, and my battery went to sleep mode. I got it to work but then the battery quickly discharged after 5 minutes of riding. Furthermore the app sucks as the reading is incorrect on the battery.

I've been waiting for over a month to have customer service send me over a box for return and they keep promise to give me a tracking number but it has not happened.

BE WARNED. Their Customer service is atrocious and their e-bike is terrible.<//review>

<review>Pure Cycles HQ / Showroom is amazing! A huge selection of their bikes are on display as well as a full arsenal of gear and apparel.

The space is big and welcoming and the Pure Cycles employees working in the open office nearby are always friendly and helpful. They sometimes have POP UP sales and other events in the space.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Just few days ago i was passing by this place and i do not regret that I spent some time to check out their bike selection. People who work there are great. They answered my every silly question and let me try out each and every bike. I found what I was looking for and i am very pleased with my purchase!
Thank you Pure Cycles!! My bike is so comfortable and looks sweet👍<//review>

<Text>Had a great time talking to one of the staff here (anthony). He was very knowledgeable and took the time to hear me out and help me find a bike that would suite my needs. Cool place, nice dog, no A/C, and nice bikes. I was even allowed to take one for a trial spin which made the visit especially fun and helpful.</Text><Rating>5</Rating>< gmap_id>

Nice shop with an expanded selection of bikes. People might think of Pure as single speed only but their road bikes are beauties and fun to ride! Well built, I've had no reason to return to the shop except for a regular a tune up.

The shop is a little hard to find as the front is obscured behind a larger building. Just know that the shop is in the back located within the warehouse. All of their bike models are available to look over. They have a small selection of nice bike essentials: bags, lights, bells, locks, etc.

The online service is probably easy enough but I would recommend going to the showroom to meet some of the guys there and admire the bikes!</text>

Look, the bikes look amazing. The simple and artistically fathomable design at glance is beautiful, and revolutionized the common look for commuters, but the quality and structure of the frame in relation to the wheels is lacking. I enjoy riding these bikes no matter how bad or lacking the physical quality is merely because they look so clean. I purchased the Uniform (Black wheels, Yellow frame) and enjoy it, however accidentally fell while riding because I wasn't using my hands on the bars and drifted into the gutter of the sidewalk, no biggie. It wasn't a big fall, it was just a short burst of concrete and of moral embarrassment. I walked away fine, but was somewhat disappointed to see the front wheel partially disturbed. The wheel was really slow because the break tabs that are supposed to lie parallel to the wheel were actually leaning against it. The bike scratches somewhat easily, but the entire thing can also be customized as well, ensuring personal beauty. The Bikes are easy and beautiful.. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!</Text>

<text>Fantastic bike for the money. Quality components, nice geometry, and extremely smooth riding bike, even considering the Thickslicks ride a little hard at 95psi. As a bigger guy right at 6' with 32" inseam, I was in between frame sizes, but the 58 is fine.

The package came via UPS, and was not treated nicely. My suggestion to Pure would be to insulate the front fork and seat stem a little better -- I had to bust out a hammer and brass punch to "adjust" so the the front wheel hub and seat post would actually install.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I recently purchased the Coaster in the color Abaco from Pure Cycles. I received it within a few days, assembled it and to my horror I had ordered the wrong size. They agreed to exchange it for the right size, sent me a return label and within another few days I had the correct size. I drive a bus for the city and often take my bike with me. I get a lot of compliments and highly recommend Pure Cycles to everyone I meet. The great thing about all this is they have partnered with Affirm so I could get my bike right away. Super, super company!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< user_id>

What a great company! I love my bike so much. I am olannng on buying a few for family members for the holidays. Their customer service team was on top on my order and updated me throughout the buying/shipping process. Rare these days to feel so exciting about a purchase and a company that o would take the time to write such a glowing review.< /Review>

I was looking for a bike to ride along the boardwalk and came across The Sydney model.  Typically I am skeptical of cruisers because they feel heavy when I ride, but I loved the look and went for it.  So glad I did!  The ride is as nice as the look - easy to navigate and smooth on different types of pavement.  Couldn't be happier with my purchase.< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>I just purchased my 3rd Pure Fix bike from Pure Cycles.  This company is a pleasure to do business with.  They even invited me to come check out their warehouse and give me a tour, which I might take them up on.  The on-line process was simple while their customer support person was extremely knowledgable and helpful.  The bikes are so cool and I didn't have to spend a crazy amount of money on a nice functional bike.  I certainly would recommend this company to my friends and actually already have.

Nice job Pure Cycles.  Thanks for making the customer feel good about their purchase.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c2955d266fd33b:0xbb4b409190d6ebf1</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Anthony (bike shop boss) is a real gem in the industry. I've had the pleasure of working with him on a number of projects from their Draft: LA events to stocking their shelves with USA made bike bags and accessories. I've worked with Pure Cycles on a B2B level and couldn't be happier with their communication and attention to detail. Hopefully when the weather clears we can plan a mixed terrain/gravel ride! If you haven't checked out their retail store in front of the warehouse, I suggest you pay them a visit, check out their rad selection of bikes, bags and other cycling gear and their amazing view of the Verdugo Mtn range!<//Text>

Wow.  Talk about good customer service.  I ordered my bike to the wrong place because I was not paying attention.  I called purefix a few days later to fix the issue and they told me it had already shipped, but perhaps they could bring me another one as apparently I live close to one of the owners.

To my surprise, one of the owners (Michael I think?), hand delivered me my bike after I had made the mistake.  Talk about going the extra mile.

The bikes themselves are great, such a clean and easy ride.  Will definitely be coming back to these guys for another bike soon.< /review>

I couldn't believe that I could find what I was looking for, but my friend refered me to Pure Cycles. They have great bikes to offer and you can always get a ride on any bike to feel if it's what you are looking for.

Best bike for the best price, hands down - I love everything about these bikes, from the plethora of color choices, to the quality of the parts and design (at a price point that is way less than any comparable bike on the market), to the friendly and knowledgeable support staff, to the silky--smooth ride.  The keyword in "Pure Fix Cycles" really is "Pure".</review>

We’ve also reached out to the shop to find out what happened, make sure they’re training their employees on the Bylt process, our bikes, and to discourage any sort of predatory up-selling like you experienced.\n\nWhile we regret what you had to deal with, we really appreciate the feedback and we’re always trying to improve – your notes should help us ensure that other customers don’t face similar hurdles in the future.\n\nSorry again that you had to go through that. We hope riding the bike provides much more happiness than the “pick-up” provided frustration, and we’re excited to have you be a part of the Pure Cycles family.\n\nPlease reach out to us so we can get that rack on there for you and provide any additional help you need. We hope you’re having an otherwise wonderful week and we’re looking forward to getting this made right.'}</response>< Date>

<Text>UPDATE:
Pure Cycles followed through with great Customer Service after posting my initial review and really fixed the situation. That's great because the the Urban Commuter is pretty sweet. For a high quality, affordable bike I would not hesitate to recommend buying from them online. I think my experience was just one of those flukes and appreciate Pure Cycles for making it right.

INITIAL REVIEW:
Great bike, horrible purchasing experience! I bought the Urban Commuter bike from the Pure Cycles website. I chose the option they offer to get the bike delivered to a "trusted" and "local" shop in order to activate the warranty on the bike. The shop ended up being a little over an hour away with traffic, no local but not the end of the world. The worst part was calling the shop to see if the bike was ready to pick up. I called Bici Sport in Petaluma (the shop chosen by pure cycles to deliver) and spoke to Jeff. He told me the Urban rear rack I bought with the bike did not fit on the back or the front and they broke it. Then he tried to tell me he could sell me a rack there. Also told me I could have gotten a better deal on a better bike from them. Told me there would be a fee when I pick it up, which wasn't true as I paid Pure Cycles for the delivery. There was more but just all in all Pure Cycles online purchase process was one of the worst buying experiences I've ever had. Buying a bike was supposed to be fun. I contacted Pure Cycles and they didn't seem to care much or really even acknowledge my experience. I like the bike so that's nice but I would not recommend buying from them online or the bikeshop delivery method they advertise.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80c2955d266fd33b:0xbb4b409190d6ebf1</gmap_id>< Name>

Absolute trash. The only thing the bike has going for it is looks. It's made out of the cheapest materials possible. Just enough to let it roll out of the store. The wheels break and go out of true instantly. The brakes have no power. Don't bother trying to contact customer service about it as they will take LITERALLY weeks to tell you you're out of luck. Don't waste your time or money on these "bikes", sorry they aren't bikes, they are trash, because that is where they will end up after 100 miles or less.<//review>

<review>Horrible.... I purchase the bike because I wanted one and one of my favorable Youtuber suggest this is a nice brand.  When the package came, the seat pad is broken, and I emailed the customers services --- no reply. I DO NOT think these bikes worth the $$$$.  looks very cheap.<//review>< username>

Every time I deal with PureFix, its exceptional. I own a bunch of their bikes and have never once been disappointed. They are light, functional, and very stylish. I always get stopped and asked about my bikes and how those people can get their hands on their own. When I went to their open house a few months ago and met a bunch of people on the PureFix team, I was amazed by how inclusive and collaborative everyone was. Its shows in their products as everything from their website to their  one-off spokes are top notch. They deal with their customers with grace and understanding that everyone rides at different levels and wants different things from their bikes; exactly how you should handle business. I couldnt recommend the bikes and the company any more and I truly hope that others give them a try. They are setting the tone for their industry!<//review>

They shipped the wrong bike and it has been a nightmare trying to get the correct bike shipped. It's been almost a month and I have not received the correct bike. It's become a part-time job trying to call/email for them to fix the error they made. Customer service is horrible. They don't respond to any emails and they don't follow through on what they say on the phone. Will never recommend this company to anyone.< /text>

<review>Customer service is awful never got a response back after several calls and email. I purchased the original fixie/ India model black and gold.

Pure Fix customer service is awful. Do not believe their damage control when they reply to reviews and promise to fix things. They do not. It is all damage control for their poor quality parts.

It took a week, and sending emails multiple times to get a response from them, and they refused to do anything and blamed it on shipping damage. I called them, and they kept claiming it was shipping damage, but refused to tell me how you scratch up the metal under the paint, without damaging the paint, when it is blatantly obvious the frame was damaged before painting. Either way they refused to do anything or admit any sort of fault, would not honor any sort of warranty replacement because they claimed there were no replacements, and told me to send it back to Amazon because they didn't want to deal with it.

"Lifetime warranty" isn't even good for 2 weeks.< /text>

<text>The worst, don't even waste your time. I order with Pure over City Grounds simply because the overall finish of the bike is exactly what I've been looking for. I purchased the Alfa(BlueFrame/whitewheels) so I ordered and paid the extra money for express shipping... Well that's where the problems begin. 1. They advertise that they sell to America/Canada with ease. This is a lie. At checkout my final total was 560, looked at my bank account they charged me 745. I emailed them and they're response was "you placed the order in Canada and you need to account for the conversion rate" they don't tell you anywhere what currency you're paying. 2. I paid the extra amount for express shipping. It was basically standard shipping with how long everything took. So I asked for the extra money back. They didn't feel responsible and told me to take it up with fedex. They basically told me the same thing. 3. I accepted that I was going to be charged 745. But 3 days after I placed the order I was refunded 745 and then charged 761. 4. The employees/support team very slow and don't seem to know what they are doing, so good luck if you have any issues. I wouldn't have ordered had I known that I was dealing with the most incompetent & lazy company. Do yourself a favour & order from City Grounds they at least act like they care.< /text>< resp>

The wheels are crap. The are made of one piece of metal that comes apart at the seam. Brakes don't work well because the paint on the wheels words as lubricant. The tires are too big for the wheels and pop out of the wheel when u inflate to 80 PSI. The crank creaks when you pedal hard. Otherwise everything else works.< /Text>

<Text>These guys are the best. I had an issue with a unit I purchased from amazon, so I emailed Ac Infinity’s customer service. They agreed to ship me a brand new unit, free of charge, and gave me a return shipping label. Thanks, Richard! I will 100% be buying more products from this company.</Text>< pics>

< Review>
I had purchased an ac infinity fan in order to create air circulation in my dart frog terrarium. Not only did it create the intended air circulation that I had desired, but it also lowered the inside temperature slightly. Furthermore, the fan not producing a lot of noise and its small size makes it very convenient to use. I am well pleased.< /Review>

AC infinity knows how to treat their customers right. Their ventilation fans are as smart as they say they are. I haven’t had any problems with their quality but I had a question and they went above and beyond to get me the information. They even showed me competing products because it fit my needs more than what they had to offer at the time. Their customer service is great and I’ve been recommending them and their products to everyone. Highly recommended!</text>

Easy install and ordering was easy enough. I put it in the back of my gas fireplace where it’s protected from the heat. Runs and works great. I have to take a flashlight to see if it’s running for it is so quiet. Ready for winter!<//review>

<review>Be prepared to be disappointed! I was not able to set me fan up the day I got it because although they did come with useless wall mounts they didn’t come with rope hangers Unluckily for me no stores near me had any which resulted in a horrible impression from this brand. Make sure you have extra clamp hangers and if you can’t find 2 pairs of clamp hangers in your house don’t say I was unprepared. If you don’t you’ll have to pay for shipping for a 5 dollar product or better yet choose to give your money to a different brand. I’m sure the fan is okay but not being able to use it when I’m in dire need of correcting an environmental situation Is disappointing and aggravating. 0/10 based it being useless out of the box.< /review>< gmapID>

< Review>
Excellent cooling system to protect cabinet enclosed electronics!

I moved all my media electronics (AppleTV, Marantz AV receiver & XBox) into a enclosed cabinet next to the fireplace. I was concerned about overheating and needed a simple ventilation solution. I am amazed by the cabinet cooling system that includes a thermostat, fan system and integrated control board. When activated the fans are quiet and are easy to program. For the money this system exceeded my expectations!!!</Review>

I use ac infinity fans only on about 20 or more reptile enclosures for my Australian Frilled Dragon breeding program. Helps promote air flow through the enclosures for healthy clean air for my Dragons. Awesome. products! Top of the line! Y’all need to create a line.of fans for the pet industry.</Text>

<review>I purchased the exhaust fan for my AV closet which has a full rack of equipment, including switches, an AV server, a receiver and 8 SONUS amps. The fan was easy to install and is very quiet. I can leave the door closed and it keeps the closet at the temperature that I set. I’m very happy with the purchase from AC infinity.</review><Rate>5</Rate>< resp>

<review>Their fans are by far the best i have ever had. I liked it so much i ended up buying another T6. If your have a grow room i highly recommend upgrading to this fan. You will never have to worry about raising or lowering your fan manually due to temperature or humidity.< /review>< Rating>

Amazing device! You can barely hear it working unless you put it on max power and yet much quieter than any other fan I had. You should start working in Europe guys I can foresee a huge success if you do so as there is no better fans as AC Infinity period!!<//text>

I’ve bought ac infinity fans for years and they’ve always worked great and no problems. Sometimes it is louder than I expected but I have no reference for comparison. It’s a little quieter than a box fan.<//review>

Super disappointed in my T6 and in the customer support, I don’t recommend this company and this fan is NOT silent not even close sounds like a inline fan to me even with my closet shut. Also the thermometer isn’t accurate. 1 star. Stand by your product and don’t make false claims.<//Text>

This company makes Very good, Easy to install, powerful, Better than I anticipated fans. I got a couple of fans from Lowe’s in from Home Depot no power wasn’t worth it this went down is the trick it’s a little bit more expensive but it’s worth the money</review>

<date>1589553929262<//date><rating>5< /rating><Review>Recently purchased a T6 fan. Outstanding product!  Extremely well made. Very quiet. Very powerful. We use it in a grow tent for exhaust. Brings the temperature down to the correct level in a matter of minutes. The controller has ‘levels’ for the fan speed. We only use the ‘3’ level. That maintains the temperature just fine. Super quiet at that speed. The fan has a ramp up feature. When it starts the fan runs at level 1. Runs there for a while. Then goes up to 2, 3, etc. Does the same thing when it is shutting down. Support from AC Infinity is outstanding. Very fast. Extremely helpful and knowledgeable!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c32bbe8da488b7:0x718ff71b41eed69b<//Gmap_id></record>

I have been selling AC Infinity products for the past two years, selling a component cooler for each receiver, rack mount cooling systems, and cabinet cooling systems, and all are of the highest quality workmanship, especially for the cost and everything works as advertised.<//Review>

I havent bought anything from ac infinity but they were very professional and kind when I called in. Turns out they don't have the type of fan I needed but they still took the time to teach me more about cooling fans. They even emailed me links to other company's products that were more suitable for me heating issue. Thank you!< /Review>

<pics>None</pics><review>The hype is real. This Cuban Restaurant is the real deal. It screams authenticity as you walk through the entrance. I ordered the oxtail stew which I saw in a yelp picture. Amazing. The oxtail fell off the bone. The plantains were cooked perfectly. Unfortunately they were a little skimpy with the plantains but the food was worth it. Was told this was a Miami staple. Worth the hype. Thanks Lianni for all your help.< /review>< time>

<Text>Royal Korean Cuisine offered a la carte and tasting menus. In addition to the communal dinning room, there are over half a dozen rooms where you can host a small group of guests of up to 10-12 and there's also a large banquet hall.

I went with a group of 8 and we all got a set menu, which was mostly presented family style except for soup and a few other dishes. We dined in one of the private rooms.

Overall the cuisine was on the slightly sweet side including the beef dishes, but I was grateful they didn't use MSG.

Valet parking in the adjacent lot was only $2 (visited March 2017).<//Text>< Rating>

If you are interested in having quiet nice meal with your family or friends this is definitely the place to go. I didn’t mind paying a little extra for the service and atmosphere. The server was very nice and attentive. Food tasted excellent. What more do you look for in a restaurant.<//text>

One of the authentic Korean cuisines still pursuing the traditional taste in a more relaxed, private ambiance. Hard to find anything compatible in LA K-town. I live in Irvine and it's a rare treat for me to drive up to LA; but whenever I'm there, Yongsusan is my go-to place for a good savory Korean meal!< /review>

We just tried to have dinner here, and there was raw chicken in the mushroom gnocchi with chicken. We told the server, so that they wouldn't serve it to anyone else, and they were very rude and asked us not to upset the other customers. If you value your health do not eat here</review>

I thought it was supposed to be a ancient Korean "palace" course meal, but it turned out to be just ancient Korean course meal. For $52 per person(middle option), did not seem worth it. Food was good, but not great, and like I said, not worth it "to me"<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c78251984b6d:0x9b9c5efe2358cc08<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Delicious and perfectly authentic. The portions are rather small, but make up for it in taste. Specifically, the saag paneer and veggie korma are to be noted. Desserts not worthwhile.<//review>

If you want to try authentic Korean food that is not AYCE Korean bbq, this is the place to try authentic food.  Definitely the best Korean food as it is supposed to taste.  A bit pricey but well worth it in my book.  A must try!</text>

I was there to treat my non-Korean business partner a Korean course meal. I have to admit I never like the idea of a course meal so maybe I am biased.

At first, I thought the price was outrageous but reluctantly rationalized it as a course meal. However, the whole dining experience there really did not change my initial impression.
The dishes did not appear to be authentic or traditional to me and tasted rather bland to me except for the fish (a replacement of pork but was rather salty). The service was not impressive either. All they did was bringing out the dishes and they never paid attention to the needs of the customers. I had to walk up to the front to ask for an extra pair of chopsticks and forks to bone the fish and the change of the plates. I may be one of those impatient ones but the server was hardly around our table except for the time she brought out the dishes. In a way, it may be an inherent problem of this 'course meal' because the servers are busy bringing out the dishes. It was supposed to be a business lunch but I really could not focus on the conversation.

I truly regretted that I took her there and do not think I will ever go to one of these places on my own, especially if I have to pay. I hope the management of the restaurant reads this so that they could think about how to improve customers' dining experience.</review>

<Text>This is one of the nicest korean restaurant. They specialize Gaesung style Korean food, which does not have strong flavors. So for some of the koreans from the south who are used to the strong flavors might feel bland.

There is a caveat to this place, it's a more traditional Korean style restaurant. Don't expect your typical AYCE service or a soup and noodle joint. This is higher quality, tapa style restaurant that is better suited for celebrations. Definitely a little more expensive but you can't find something better in the area.</text>

<Text>I guess this is the place for traditional Korean family gatherings. Came here to celebrate grandma's 90th bday. My uncle had reserved one of the private rooms on the first floor, which comfortably accommodated the 40 some-odd well-wishers. They had the buffet set up against the wall, and there was a projector screen and podium, as well as a large table of honor at the front of the room for grandma and grandpa (see photo).

The food was pretty good, tasted very homey. I ate most everything but skipped the kalbi jjim (braised short ribs) and the tang soo yuk (like a sweet and sour pork)--they didn't look that appetizing to me. I liked the the fried fish cakes, dumplings, and the various side dishes. The miso-based soup was pretty good, but it was weird to eat that out of styrofoam cups and a plastic spoon. Were they really out of proper dishes and utensils? There were regular plates and utensils for the other stuff, though. The best part was watching the white hubby eat the so-called "desserts"--an especially unsweet assortment of rice cakes that all the old people like. One kind was so unsweet it was akin to eating an eraser coated with bean powder. Yeah, he was kind of sad. :D Service was pretty decent, with a waitress devoted to our room fetching us water pitchers, distributing the cakes, etc. All in all an OK experience. I doubt I'd come back here just for the food--there are plenty of places closer to me that are just as good, but if you ever get invited to some Korean family gathering here at least you'll know the food will be decent.<//Text><response>None<//response><Rate>3<//Rate>< name>

(Translated by Google) It's a Korean-style house. There are a lot of menus and I tried a lot to keep Korean things. Is it typical for Koreans to go? Or you may feel traditional, but if you go with foreign friends, you will feel new. It's amazing that there is such a house in LA.

한정식 집이에요. 메뉴가 많고 한국적인 것을 지키려고 노력 많이했어요. 한국사람들이 가면 전형적? 혹은 전통적이다는 느낌을 받을 수 있겠지만, 외국 친구들과 가면 새롭다는 느낌을 받을 수 있을 것 같아요. LA에 이런 집이 있다는게 신기하네요.<//Text>

The food seems to come out generally neatly.
You can eat buffet style.

Each of the menus invites foreigners to join us, and the owners and staff are friendly people, so it's fun every time I visit.

< Review>
(Translated by Google) I thought it was a special food, but I don't think it is special at all because it is a way to serve only food without explanation to those who serve it.
I thought that the food was small compared to the price, and I couldn't help feeling that the last rice cake soup was jaetang.

(Original)
특별한 음식이라 생각했으나 써빙 하시는분들에 설명이 없이 음식만 날라다 주는 방식이어서 전혀 특별하다는 생각이 들지 않는다
값에 비해서 음식이 소흘하다는 생각이 많이 들었고 마지막으로 나온 떡국은 재탕이였다는 느낌을 떨칠수가 없었다.짜고 떡은 퍼져있었으니까</Review>

Overall, the side dishes are neat and the manners of those who serve are good.

<text>Huge place, two floors and a terrace. The menu offers Asian cuisine mostly Japanese and Chinese. The vegetables dumplings are great. I recommend you to share the crispy meat and the vegetables noodles. Excellent price.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTp6CDQQzyeKkJOHFy2GfTnGwQwrIxo_ORsckB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvWuGcd2acuigdeoIHan79Xz8t3a6jLqVPMMlY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoKEV2SottgMcG8vmoYC-69-zBFDkU-XcJS7u3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9V4RJC55HS2nVdAiokyRR5Awe1CjnIOKky63L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c2a4ce6a501fe7:0x25791ba568e99935</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Cool restraunt, interesting design for interior of building, fair happy hour menu and prices are fair, although there was no bartenders for lunch, service is a little slow, but the fish was good. This place is probably better for dinner.< /Text>

Came here for a Halloween party. Good music and affordable drinks. They had a nice outdoor and small indoor area. Crowd was pretty fun and it didn't seem too crowded, could still dance and move around.</Text>

<Text>My husband and I had made reservations but when we arrived there, no one asked if we had a reservation much less greet us with a hello. The young lady only asked if we wanted happy hour? She was rude and irritated because we had questions, this was our first time there.
After we gave our ordered to the waitress, the salad, soup, appetizer and entree all came out the same time. We had ordered a chicken entree that was still raw. When we asked them to hold back on our entree so we could finish our soup, salad and appetizer, we got attitude from the staff.
We will not recommend this place or ever go back. All we wanted was to have a nice meal and for them to wait on the entree so we can finish the other food. We didn't even ask them to cook the chicken more in fear of them doing something to our food. And no our entree was not sushi.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<text>I'll start by saying I usually only go here for happy hour, but their happy hour is so amazing!! All day in Sunday's and opening to 7:30 on all week days. Love the variety on their happy hour menu, I can come here, get some drinks and get super full for a great price. Love their Brussels sprouts and their Honey Walnut Shrimp, those are my two faves. 😍<//text>< pics>

I love their lunch specials. Recently had the shrimp and asparagus with black bean sauce for 9.50. Included brown rice and salad. The honey dressing was a little sweet, but other than that small gripe, the lettuce was fresh, the shrimp was cooked perfect(not over cooked like many restaurants), the bean sauce was savery(not over sweetened like many Asian American restaurants) and the asparagus was perfect. Many lunch specials aren't very special but this one is. The wait staff was quick, and the atmosphere was modern. A solid dining experience.</review>

<text>The sushi is good but what really makes this place great is all the events this place hosts. Salsa Tuesdays with lessons and free dance, Paint and Vino Wednesday and Tango Thursdays. I highly recommend this place if you are looking a place to grab some sushi and try something different during a weekday night.<//text><GmapID>0x80c2a4ce6a501fe7:0x25791ba568e99935< /GmapID><Rating>5< /Rating><name>Alex Cain<//name>< date>

<Resp>None</Resp><Review>Wokcano is a decent, affordable place for lunch in downtown Santa Monica. The lunch menu is Pan Asian with mostly Japanese and Chinese-inspired items.

Their lunch special is under $15 including tax and tip and is great for a large group of people, especially coworkers. The customer service at Wokcano is not very warm and the servers seem somewhat distracted.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

My experience here was exceptional.. Everything was perfection from the service to the food. Our waitress Malaya was so patient and awesome (I would also like to add we went in after a night out around 1am) I'm a very picky eater she recommended some delicious rolls and the food ended up being great I left the restaurant very happy..can't wait to go back. The main reason I'm on such a high about this place is basically Malaya our waitress..It has been forever since I have come across a restaurant with employees who have great attitudes and over the top service :)</Text>

Great Asian fusion restaurant. The upstairs location is great for groups. Parking can be difficult.<//Review>

Great for salsa/bachata dancing on Tuesdays and Thursdays. They close a bit early though (midnight on Tuesdays and probably 1 am on Thursdays).< /Text>

< Review>
Food is good vegetables cooked perfectly. Have eaten in the resautramt a few times and enjoyed it.
That said - Do NOT even think about trying to order a delivery. They only got one of four orders right. They did not mention you have to order rice on the side. I dont mind paying for rice just let me know if it doesnt come with it. The price was 12.00 over what it should have been according to the menu and Im not even counting the delivery fee. When I called to try to figure it out the guy just said I had an old menu so and the prices have gone up. This menu is less than 6 months old. Never again.</Review>

< review>
My wife ordered food form Wokcano  on line for delivery. When it came I had to spit out my food. My sushi was rotten and not fresh. On top of that when my wife called them up about that the customer service hung up on her. I was shocked the food was so bad, along with the customer service. They kept saying to my wife before they hung up on her that it was Chow now she had to deal with, even thought we ordered form Wokcano on line.
Anyway I called back myself and got a full refund from the manager. But this left a really bad taste in my mouth on many levels.<//review>

Even with an open bar this place still pisses me off. Food isn't worth it and it's still pretending to be an upscale place when it most definetely isn't.<//Review>

<text>My wife and I just got kicked out for not wearing a mask. The woman working there did not even ask if we had a mask, or politely ask if it would be okay, but just confronted us saying "No Mask No Service!" several times. We just walked out and my wife started crying because we wanted to purchase a necklace from there. It is amazing to me how rude people are to their customers these days, let alone a family Christian store whom we just wanted to support. Pretty soon they are going to say No Vaccine paperwork, No service... and finally, No Mark (666), No Service!" Very disappointed in this incredibly rude woman operating the store.< /text>< Rating>

<text>This place is great! The workers are welcoming & helpful. And they have everything I need. I've been to bigger Christian bookstores, and they never seem to have what I'm looking for. One stop at Selah & all my needs are taken care of. Praise God for this store.</text>< pics>

We live in the Palm Springs area and do not have a Christian book store nearby! We happened to be in the neighborhood and stopped in. Great place for finding anything Christian. GOD BLESS</text>

<text>I could of stayed inside this place for hours. This is a must stop in and see for the young children of God who  might not know that there are books of the Word that are designed for different levels of learning and styles as well as children's introduction books and inspirational  decorative art. The employees are very curtious and helpful. I purchased a Beautiful Girls Bible that had larger print and simplified for younger minds. Without the help of the lovely employee I would have a Beautiful Bible My Daughter would probably not be able to follow for a few years. My Daughter loves Her Bible and I can hardly wait when she can Read it out loud to Me. Definetly taking My youngest in to pick out some books to read to Him. Fascinating that all those books are still just another version of just 1 single Book .</text></record>

Great store! The store had way more than I thought it would. Books on every Christian/religious subject not just Bibles, cds, dvds, clothing, greeting cards,  jewelry, supplies, teen section, children section, and more. Also has great gift items.< /text>

I loved all the things that they have to offer: home decorations, church supplies, CDs, DVDs, posters, books, Bibles, photo frames, gifts, etc. However, the prices were a bit much. I came in to see if I could get any posters for my classroom. I found a couple that I liked - a map of the Middle East and a Fruits of the Spirit poster - but I looked at the back and saw they were $15 each! For just a poster! So I ended up walking out of there with nothing, unfortunately. :(</Review>

Don't let the look of place fool you. The workers are slow to acknowledged you, but they know you're there. Festive colorful interior with standard set up and palm tree mirror. Looks dated, but totally functional place. Drop a dollar into wall mounted juke box and let the music play while you wait for your order. I got two steak tacos that's loaded with hot off the grill steak. They don't skimp on meat here. Normally I like tacos that holds well with no meat pieces falling out. In this case, it fell out and I had to finished the rest with a with a fork. But, that's okay though. A good find in the excelsior if your craving Mexican. Can't go wrong and certainly no harm to try. Enjoy! Btw, Dosa is not done yet wait till spring of next year hehehe.< /text>

The best pupusas! I used to go to the place next door but they closed down. I decided to give them a shot and I have zero regrets. Their revueltas have a good amount of chicharron in them (this is rare!). There's a perfect balance between chicharron, cheese and beans. Finding good pupusas is hard, I'm glad I found them!</review></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) For me the best restaurant in the mission, I like the place, the decoration, the attention, the drinks and above all the food ..... the pupusas. A treat ... I recommend it.

I saw Doctor Said on April 14, 2021 for an assessment of my hypertension. Another Doctor prescribed 3 other medications which did not reduce my hypertension. Doctor Said ordered a different medication. Within 30 minutes my hypertension went down to 128/82. In my opinion Dr. Said is a topnotch cardiologist.<//review>

I had the most amazing quick experience this week at KHMG. I hurt my foot, I went to quick care, they sent me to X-ray, back to quick care to read the scan, the Dr told me that I fractured my ankle. She said that their podiatrist could see me immediately to go over a treatment plan. I was in and out of the building in about an hour. Exactly what I needed and one stop care.</Text>

9/10....I waited outside due to the number of folks in lobby.  Received a call for my appointment.
Seeing my doctor is always a nice experience.  He is polite, to the point; shows his knowledge that helps me make my decision on the direction of my treatment.  I appreciate him very much, as I also appreciate his staff.<//Review>

Each time I go to the clinic for services I always have a memorable experience.  Beginning with the receptionist whom are always so kind, courteous and helpful.  The medical assistants always make me feel so welcome and comfortable during my visit. The nurse practitioner’s are so informative, gentle and understanding of my feelings, my health needs and provide such wonderful care. And my specialist, Dr. Daniel Bolken is the most thorough and empathetic doctor I could ever ask for.  And thanks to everyone else not mentioned but play an important role in the success of the Visalia Medical Clinic and in providing such wonderful community health care services.  Thank you!🤗<//review>

I had to try out a few places here in Visalia before I found this clean, educated and professional establishment. Dr. Angela Pap is by far my favorite physician I've had the pleasure to have and I highly recommend her. My husband has very high standards for a physician and also appreciates how kind, thorough, professional and up to date she is. The staff are all kind and knowledgeable as well. I trust bringing my family here and feel fully taken care of at Visalia Medical Clinic.</Text>

I am deeply grateful to Dr. Warner for helping me fight a serious medical condition. One where others have dismissed my condition with little help or understanding of new protocols that can used to benefit my health.</Text>

I love my clinic. The doctors have provided me with the care I need. My current doctors have taken their time to explain questions I may have. When I have questions while at home I just send them an email and they have responded within 24 hours or less

The office ladies for Lovelace are so rude! I called to ask a question and she had the worst attitude! Seriously this happens almost every-time I call it’s always someone angry over the phone. I didn’t catch her name but she apparently works at 11:48 on fridays... seriously the customer service here is the worst. If I could give no stars I wish I could. This place has so many issues. I try to avoid it all together it’s always a mess here! They need to fix this problem..<//text>

As a single Mom of three my life can become pretty hectic at times! The doctors have always done their best to work me into their schedules or make a way for me and my kids to be seen when neccassary.  The physician staff are caring and kind and I wouldnt trust my healthcare to anyone else.</Review>< GmapID>

I hadn’t seen Dr Frank’s for almost 2 years. What I really value in a provider is for them to take the time read our charts. I know they’re really busy but we as patients really appreciate those few extra minutes in doing so. She asked how I was doing and said you need a refill on meds right? I said yes, mind you I was told I need to come in every year to check progress. But I didn’t mind being reminded how important yearly check ups are. She’s got an amazing personality, very kind too. We are trying a new med, she explained the risks and the benefits WOW! Truly impressed with the whole visit thanks again!

<Rate>3</Rate><Text>Horrible experience with Quick care staff. I left without even seeing the Dr. or PA because of how I was treated by the dr. assistant. I took a COVID test on her assistance and now they are refusing to send the results to my dr. who is at the same facility. I have been going to this facility for over 25 years and this is the 1st time I've ever complained about any services or staff there.

Updated to my post. I received a call back from the administration assistant from VMC she was very understanding and helpful  and I greatly appreciated the opportunity to talk to someone about my experience. She assured me it would be taken care of and within an hour I received a call from a doctor with my COVID results and he assured me that they would continue to look into what happened. I am really happy with the follow up and could not ask for more.</Text>< pics>

<text>Thanks for the opportunity to review Dr. Ginsberg's service as my primary care physician. He has been my doctor for 40 years and has provided excellent care at many office visits and diagnostic procedures.  I know at least one time he sent me for a second opinion to Stanford to verify if his diagnosis of silent migraines was correct or was I having TIA'S. He was correct in his original evaluation.  I really appreciated his taking the time to double check with another doctor. His office staff is efficient and appointment times do not usually involve long waits to be seen for patient evaluation. Hopefully he will be using his skills for many more years. Thank you, Dr. Ginsberg, for your many years of helping others. Keep up the good work!!!!!

Since first being examined by Dr. Lovelace, I have received the most thorough, professional care. She connected me with specialists at Sansum and UCLA when tests revealed there were bigger issues involved with my health. And since bring released from the hospital in December and remaining quarantined at home, when I have been too ill to see her in person at the clinic, I have been able to communicate with her over the FollowMyHealth portal. She has addressed any particular issues which were not responding to one med and required a different approach. I feel she has kept me alive through this pandemic, and I trust her implicitly.< /text>

Dr. Machado is amazing. I had been in pain for over a year. I had seen severally doctors and they all told me nothing was wrong. Dr. Machado took the time to look at my tests and saw what was wrong. After my surgery, I was now pain free. It is nice to be exercising again. Thanks Dr. Machado!<//review>

Had an appointment with Dr. Nguyen for allergies that had been bothering me for about a month.  He takes the time to listen to you and discussed symptoms with treatment options.  His nurse Christina is one of the best.  I always tell her that I'm comfortable coming in and my blood pressure is always lower. A great doctor and staff!!!<//review>

Dr. Said is highly recommended. I appreciate the fact that he took time to actually draw out what was going on with my mom's arteries and what needed to be down. Also nursing staff are all very friendly and caring.< /Text>

<Review>I was doing a stress test today it was to take 2 to 3 hours. I was there from 9:30a.m.til 2.45pm and there was at least 20 or so patients and these were old folk with other underlying problems. In my summation they over  booked the day.I felt bad for everyone in there they were very unhappy with the situation. Needs someones attention.<//Review><Response>{'time': 1605307015040, 'text': 'Hi Lillian, we are sorry to hear that you had a poor experience.

<Review>I went to Sequoia Prompt Care because it was conveniently located and I wasn't happy with my current primary care physician. I was delighted to find out that they had a primary care doctor right in their office.  I made an appointment with him as my reason for my initial visit could not be handled by the urgent care clinic. My first appointment with Dr. Quackenbush was amazing! He was kind, friendly, thorough, and showed interest in me as a person, not just a patient. I have seen him several times now for follow ups and I have never been happier with a medical professional in my life! As for the clinic side, they have been great as well. The wait times are reasonable and the staff is friendly and helpful.  Their app allows you to keep track of your vitals, prescriptions, and appointments. If you want a doctor that listens to you and genuinely cares for your health then look no further!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<review>It was time to find my kids a permanent pediatrician since our prior doctor’s office didn’t have one. I received a lot of good feedback about Dr. Coverston so I decided to schedule appointments for my kids. It was the best decision! We absolutely loved him. He was very friendly and thorough. He made my kids feel comfortable. I’m so happy he is now officially their pediatrician!!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I have been a patient with Visalia Medical Clinic since I was a young man. And I am now 78. The service has been excellent.

I admit to being a little on the Hypochondriac side. So sometimes I need to be talked down a bit. When I need that, they do it.  But when there is a genuine problem they address that too.

I’ve had a lot of problems, lots of surgeries, lots of hospital stays. Most always they have been right there for me.

Dr Robert Allen, my primary care physician, is great. So too is Dr Saif, an endocrinologist, who recently took over managing my diabetes. He has been a tremendous help.

I’m not really qualified to given opinions about the technical aspects of medicine. But I’m happy with the help I have received.< /review>

Clean and welcoming offices. Friendly staff. Worked very efficiently - mailed out a map for their location and patient information form weeks before my first appointment.
Had a minor procedure done in the office, and I felt Darlene Franks and her Assistant were quite skilled and made it easy from start to finish. I highly recommend this office and staff.< /text>

Coverston is amazing! First time mommy and he not only listens to all of my concerns,  he makes me feel they are valid and answers any questions. He takes his time with my baby and does his best to get her comfortable, before evaluating her. We are very lucky to have found such a great doctor!<//Text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>They switched systems so there are two bills now, one on the old system and one on the new system. No one told me that when I made a payment so my old system bill went to collections. The payment I made went to the new system. This is NOT my fault! Therefore in order for me to see a doctor I had to call the rude collection agency and had to make payments to them. The lady who helped me at Visalia Medical Clinic was very helpful and I was able to see the doctor that day. However today when I called to make a payment through the new system the lady I talked to told me I could make a payment but cannot be seen by the doctor until my payments are made in full to the collection agency. In the first place this would NOT be happening had they applied my payment to my old account. And it's a good thing we are not sick right now if we do get sick we are forced to go somewhere else. I'm just about done with them. My husband and I along with my mom go here but I'm not sure how much more I can handle. And whoever I talked with on the phone today was just plain old rude. I'm not wealthy so I cannot pay a full amount on our bills we have no choice but to make payments.<//Text><resp>None<//resp>< Rate>

Dr. Mallari is the most amazing doctor that we have ever had! Very compassionate about her patients, and takes a lot of time with you.  Always runs tests or refers you to a specialists if she feels the need. She calls you with lab results ASAP, as late as 7 or 8pm (even on a Friday) night!

She is the BEST!

<Text>Took my daughter in for the varicella vaccine and the nurse gave her the flu vaccine. Good thing my daughter isn’t allergic to eggs... There have been no repercussions.  It is a horrible feeling to have something happen to your child that you did not consent to and all you get is a shrug of the shoulders and a sorry. Very disheartening and helpless feeling.< /Text>< pictures>

My family highly recommends Dr. Kathryn Hall from Visalia Medical Clinic. Over the past 15  years, she has helped us with everything from every day check ups and sports physicals to much more serious illness including Kawasaki Disease, Valley Fever and a ruptured appendix. Her calm, diligent demeanor is highly respected as is her patience and true caring for our children. We have had professional, competent, and friendly visits to VMC for years!< /Text>

<Review>Recently moving to Visalia came with many changes and healthcare wasn’t even first on my list. I’ve had the same PCP for years so the idea of a new city and new MD was daunting enough, however, Dr. Quackenbush was outstanding. Calm, collected, and clear on his explanations- I knew it was the right fit.
Kindly he gave me options, allowed me to express my concerns and was very prompt with our time.

I fully stand behind any doctor who treats his patients like they are beings and competent to understand their DX.

Thank you to the front staff and MA’s for a swift pre-visit and Dr.Q for your help.

Very happy with my new PCP.

<Text>Great place where multiple specialists are in the same area.

QuickCare is why they are not 5 stars. I like that they're open on the weekends because most places aren't. That's why this isn't a 2 star review.
The girls working up front are usually unkind every time I visit. They are not ideal representatives of a health care facility due to their stern speaking manner and lack of compassion. I feel like a burden every time I walk in. I can understand someone having a bad day, but it's been over a year since I've last visited and they're still having a bad day.
I went to QuickCare because I know VMC can do abdominal scans. But QuickCare physicians cannot order abdominal scans, only your primary care physician can. They also cannot create an appointment for you with your physician when they tell you only your physician can order a scan. I would love to visit my physician, but as I have reoccurring pain, the pain usually goes away by the time I can see them and by the time I can get scanned.
I used to go to Family Healthcare Network and the assistants up front are so nice and helpful. The physicians also try everything they can to understand what is bothering you and to make you feel better and cared for. They also have hours open longer than VMC and they can take walk-ins instead of making an appointment 2 weeks out like I've had to wait before at VMC. I plan to go back to FHN.<//Text><date>1580076044678< /date></record>

I've had too many, with  very long waits, that I was rushed through and condescended to--not here.  The MA was professional and friendly and made follow up appointments for me before I left.   Dr. Allen was personable, relaxed, and spent more time with me than expected.  He was forthright and clearly discussed and  explained an appropriate plan while providing good  information.

<review>Dr Tomooka and staff are awesome! Both my kids have seen him since birth. My oldest is 2 now and my youngest is 3 months. My youngest recently got Bronchiolitis right before the holidays of course, but Dr Tomooka was available to see him Christmas Eve morning and then called later that afternoon to check on him and was also available throughout the holiday in case he got worse. He then called again day after Christmas to check on him and was available to see him that day as a follow up. As hard as it is to get in some times for an emergency I LOVE the fact that he does not over book himself so that for well baby check ups we never wait longer than 5-10 min! Would highly recommend him to anyone!!</review></record>

Dr Mellari is the best! She has been a blessing that God used her to treat me! I walked in on Tuesday for low back pain. Ended up in the ER on Wednesday. And Dr mellari called to check up on me! She ordered Rx needed. She requested a STAT PA for an MRI by Friday staff called me to tell me it was approved and faxed over to be scheduled! Thank you Dr mellari, Laura, and all the staff for working together. When I needed you the most!</Text>

Okay so I walked in to this medical walk in clinic at 11. I was not admitted to a room until one thirty. I waited even longer to be seen by the doctor. Around three I asked the women in the front if I could pay my copay and leave because I had to go to school and my husband had to go to work. They said I would not have to pay my copay. Since I had been in their office for over four hours waiting, and I live more than an hour away from Visalia, I asked the an older black short haired lady  in the front desk for a note. I was going to be late to school. She said she would give me one, but she was only going to put that I was there in their office, and that I was not seen. Which got me upset because I had been there over four hours waiting. It was not my fault. A typical doctor's visit should only take 1-3 hours. I don't understand why she was so rude or why she could not put on my note that I had been waiting to be seen for over four hours. Every time I have gone it always seems like it is an issue to get a note that I was there. Last time I was there I had asked for one, and the woman yelled unprofessionally across the room to the doctor that I wanted a doctor's note. I just wanted one saying that I was there. I also have noticed that the women in the front desk are always arguing.
I  plan on changing doctor's soon, so I no longer have to feel akward for asking for a note!</text>

My Primary Care Physician is Dr Benjamin Brennan. Dr Brennan is a very good doctor. He listens to my concerns and provides the necessary care. Dr Brennan doesn't rush me out immediately to a specialist, but takes care of what he can and gives a referral when necessary.

I, personally, am very satisfied with VMC and especially with Dr Brennan. This is very important to me as one of Jehovah's Witnesses. Dr Brennan respects my decision not to accept a blood transfusion.<//text>

<Text>Regarding Dr Whitaker

I have psoriasis all my life but the last few months was the worst ever. I always have long beautiful hair  (had compliments many times), but because of my severe psoriasis in my scalp I thought of having my head shaved,  that's how depressed and frustrated I was. Then I went to see Dr Whitaker! He's the best! He tried different things, he never gave up on me and he promised he will take of my severe psoriasis , he's very consoling especially he saw I'm pretty much in tears. I told him he made miracles on me because I'm better now, thought I will suffer from this forever.

Dr Whitaker to me is GOD sent.  The staff on the clinic are the best, too.<//Text>< Response>

I was treated promptly and courteously when I first spoke with the front desk. At Dr Prah’s office, the staff was helpful and very courteous. I enjoy my visits to VMC because I get to deal with  people who enjoy their work to help me improve my health.</text>

Dr. Hall is the epitome of the ultimate provider. He walks in the door, and his only focus is the patient. He explains all treatment in layman's terms. His manner relaxes the patient so the patient's anxiety is lowered. I feel it is a privilege to have Dr. Hall as my doctor.  Dr. Hall's staff is personable, efficient, and caring also.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

I recently found myself in need of finding another physician, as mine retired. I reached out to the Visalia Medical Clinic and they were so helpful and friendly with my becoming a patient of Dr. Brennan’s. From my first stop at the front desk, to my appointment with Doctor Brennan, I could not have been more pleased.</text>

Today I has the worst Experience ever with Quick care I'll no longer bring my son to this horrible place,  Specially with the unquified health care Professionals who cannot help out a child in need and will rather advise you to take him to the ER because they don't know what wrong with him.... horrible I'll be summing a formal complaint to the regional Medical Supervisor.<//Text>

< Review>
I had the opportunity to meet with PA Tate Gordon at the Visalia Medical Clinic Quick Care earlier today, a follow-up to a visit with the Quick Care area.  Thank you Tate for taking the time to talk with me, understand my concerns, go over recommendations, as well as review my history with Visalia Medical Clinic.  Since Dr. Perez left the clinic, I've been waiting to be assigned to a new physician and you were able to assist before I could get a new doctor. I can't thank you enough for the time and allowing me to talk (and you listened), haven't had that in a while.</Review>

I love the pediatrics here. My children see Dr. Nagatani and he and his staff are just amazing. They are all very patient and knowledgeable and i highly recommend them. Sure the lines are long sometimes, but always worth the wait. High Quality Care!< /Review>

<text>I take my mother-in-law to see Dr. Ruvalcaba and he calls us in on time and he and his nurse are very patient and caring. We were also able to get imaging done quickly, without an appointment. She is in a wheelchair, so having imaging and the lab all right there in one place is very convenient.< /text>< Rating>

Dr. Coverston is amazing.  Our insurance sent us to him when our original pediatrician closed his practice.  I was a bit nervous about changing doctors, but those nerves were calmed at our 1st visit with Dr. Coverston.  He immediately noticed a condition that had previously been dismissed by our original pediatrician.  Later that night he called to go over lab results, something I didn’t even realize doctors did these days.  He speaks to both myself and my children.  He listens and never seems rushed.  He genuinely cares!</Text>

We went for our first visit for our 1 year old with Dr Coverston last week and had a great experience! The office staff was patient and our nurses were very helpful! We had an amazing pediatrician where we lived before and had a bad experience at a different clinic in Visalia. We are so thankful we found Dr Coverston. He was very informative and extremely encouraging. We have another appointment for our 3yr old soon and are really looking forward to it!<//Text>

The staff have always treated me and my husband with respect and care. Dr Mallari recently referred me to a urologist-Dr Chidi. Dr Chidi and his office staff our outstanding too! I am a FNP and know the importance of having a provider and staff that take the time to answer questions as well as educate patients on the illness they may be experiencing. They do this leaving no questions unanswered!! I feel confident as a patient and as a provider who refers patients to both of thes providers, that outstanding care will be provided!!

<Text>Dr.Allen has been my primary care physician for just a few years now as my last pcp retired. I shopped around and decided on Dr.Allen for a big reason. He doesnt rush you and he listens. Many people would agree that it can feel your doctor is just collecting an office visit fee. You will not feel this way with Dr. Allen. I  Highly  recommend Dr. Allen if you need a new pcp or just dont like your current one, you have choices.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x809526233d564bbb:0x2259876432a2a443< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>
<text>I always appreciate what Darlene Franks, my dermatologist, does to either freeze odd skin spots, or take a biopsy when it looks iffy. There is a lot of skin cancer in my family, so prevention is the best route.

The staff are always courteous, friendly, and professional, too. I highly recommend Darlene Franks.</text>< userid>

Awful! We had a 10:45 appointment and didn’t get into a room for an hour and then sat in that room for another hour!! They have no respect for anyone else’s time. The only good thing was once the doctor actually saw us she was thorough.< /Text>

Great doctors, and nurses. They are always very patient with my two. When my six year old daughter had to have some blood work done the phlebotomist was very kind as my daughter screamed and yelled because she was so scared. She was very reassuring and made the whole process easier.< /review>

Some LONG wait times, over 1 hr. PC out so saw NP. He said he’d order inhaler and cough meds. Got to our pharmacy and no inhaler ordered. Late in day so pharmacist said he’d send a memo and hopefully will get it tomorrow. Guess another trip!
Cough meds come in pills. I was told they don’t have liquid prescription as most have opioids so I guess they assume we all have addiction issues. The few days worth of pills were almost $16!< /review>

<Review>I left so many voicemails for Britney on extension 3 and received no call back. When I was finally able to talk to her from being transferred from the operator, she was very rude. If you’re new or have a new addition to the family you’re better off dialing 0 for the operator.< /Review><user_id>111914976880277145768< /user_id>< pictures>

The radiology department here is incompetent. I was misdiagnosed with pneumonia when I had actually suffered a pulmonary embolism and a partially collapsed lung following abdominal surgery. I nearly died as a result, and have been left with ongoing pain since. The staff is rude and uncooperative, with absolutely no concern for patients well being. I would never trust them with the welfare of anyone I care for.<//text>

Do not come here!!!! Very bad attitude and no respect for the customer. Came here last Thursday in hopes a dr can look at my son coz he was sick. When I came in here was greated by a large heavy set woman her name is yadira, when I walked in she didn’t acknowledge me or greet me, instead she says “what do you want” I had explained to her that my son needs to see a dr and it’s urgent, she said “Go have a seat there are other ppl before you” in a aggressive tone of voice, I had no choice but to have a seat and wait in hopes that my son will be seen I waited for 2 hours and no one bothered to even ask to help, then a couple come in with their kid yadira greets them with smiles and cheers give them 10 start service, she looks at me and looks away with a grin, 5-10 mins later she brings them in and we are still waiting out here, I finally go up to her and tell her why are we waiting when they just came in, she paused for a sec, studers and loudly says “they were here first” I asked for their business card coz they didn’t have any out she laughed at me and said good luck finding it. I had no choice but to leave and finally today found them</Review>

After our children’s pediatrician retired we were unsure of who to see. After interviewing a few pediatricians we really appreciated Dr. Coverston’s knowledge, proactivity, and willingness to listen. He made our son feel confortable and it was a very pleasant experience.</text>

I agree, one star too many! Rude support staff: Front office was curt, and interrupted my question to walk away and visit with fellow coworker about their weekend. Doctor's Receptionist wasn't much better..after scheduling a surgery, she informed me I needed to pay my deductible upfront. When I inquired as to how much that would be, she said it was my job to figure it out! The final straw was when my daughter presented a large mass in her stomach, about the size of a grapefruit. We went in to Quick Care, because it was Saturday. They were at least concerned, but unable to order a CT scan. We were told to come back and see a Doctor on Monday so we could get the CT ordered. After a long, worrisome weekend, we returned, to be told by the front staff to go to Quick Care. What? I canceled my surgery and all upcoming appointments today. VMC, you just lost an insured family of seven.</Text>

I spoke to one of the receptionist on the phone and they were extremely rude and unhelpful. She said she cant answer my question and can't do nothing. All I wanted to know is if owed a bill as they repeatedly call during my work hours. I asked if she could at least give me a phone number to talk someone that can tell me...she persisted that she can't do nothing for me.< /Text>

The worst experience ever! I had to call to reschedule an appointment because something had came up. So, I go to call and I am put on hold for 12 minutes before a lady picks up and asks me to stay on hold some more! So I wait and finally she answers and I tell her that I need to reschedule my appointment. She rudely tells me she can't help me and transfers my call. And so now I am on hold for another 10 minutes. Finally when I hear someone pick up the phone.. they HANG UP on me!!! I am so sick of the horrible customer service I get from the people over there. I think it's time that I switch doctors.<//text>

<text>Dr. Hall is one of the best pediatric providers I've ever met she sees my now almost 16 year old son and my seven-year-old daughter she has been there provider since the year 2013.
When I'm not sure if I am happy with a medical professional,  dentist, therapist, & specialists for more than 2 reasons I WILL SWITCH TO ANOTHER .
An average visit with Dr .Hall is 20 minutes to over an hour. She seems very thorough.
She is the best doctor my children ever had.
I'm going to be switching my almost 16 year old son to a male doctor in a few weeks ONLY because my son would like a male doctor he can share his concwens with about  alot of "developing male  issues".</text>< gmap_id>

I highly recommend Dr. Tamooka if you are looking for a pediatrician. He's a family and kids oriented. A very professional, knowledgeable, and caring dr. I like the fact that he go thr extra miles by calling to follow up and see how my child is doing if she was sick. He listen and answer all your questions. His 2 Lvn/back MA are so sweet and nice.<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Dr. Tomooka genuinely cares for his children. We just had our first baby girl and he made not one but two hospital visits back to back to meet and check up on her. He even had her first appt. card ready to  for us in his wallet.  We then had an appointment on her day 4 and then again on her day 7. All interactions with Dr.T and his staff have been very positive. He listens to all of our concerns and doesn't make you feel rushed. We are very happy with our pediatrician choice!</review>< pictures>

<rating>1</rating><review>The yelp reviews are more accurate the executive manager of this clinic is a heartless administrator that has lost touch with humanity. When your trying to pay your doctor and he won't accept your payment of your collection becuse u get behind every year...and catch up... Well... Living w cancer this long will give u finiacial problem's...you finally get ahead to pay and he does not care. Do Not Go To Visalia Medical Clinic if Richard Strid is still running this place. He won't care you have cancer and will rather send u a pity letter that patient advocacy may help you find a doctor.  I know my husband can get a refferal to see another doctor not asociated with the clinic he has Blue Cross any Doc would be happy to have him. Oh his letters imply he dose not make enough money on you as well...w costs of sending to a collection agency. I think we all know they have made out well enough on the back end of our insurance for 5 years... I hope they put a checks and balance on his decitions. O come up with an appeal process. He shoukd not be making these decitions alone.</review><Name>Leslie Ann Manzo< /Name><Pics>None< /Pics><gmap_id>0x809526233d564bbb:0x2259876432a2a443< /gmap_id><userid>105987538669643849042</userid><time>1534435146068<//time></record>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Text>I have used Visalia Medical Clinic since I was 18, and I am now 34. I had a physical in March of 2018 with Omololu Olayinka. Before I had the physical I spoke with the receptionist and requested that they NOT test me for STD/STI. I explained to the receptionist that I had not been sexual active since my previous testing.

I have the blood drawn for my physical a few months later I get a bill for $68.15 on top of what my insurance already paid. When I look at the test billing they had tested me for STD/STI. I dispute the testing and was put into contact with Rick Strid. He refused to do anything, claiming he spoke with Omololu and the nurse. He claimed that both Omololu and the Nurse said I requested the testing, which is a lie I never spoke to either about the testing, I spoke to the receptionist. That is verifiable as you never are allowed to speak with the physician over the phone.

His other excuse was that the testing had been done. Well that's great but I already new the results would be negative and were not needed. Now I am stuck with the $68.15 bill.

I asked him to prove that I requested the testing and he could not.

A few years earlier when I did request STD testing and had it done. Omololu ordered the wrong test for the HIV screening. She ordered a test for the prevalence of HIV in the blood, which came back as an error because I do NOT have HIV. They still tried to bill me for that testing and I had to dispute that with them to get it worked out. I then had to have a normal HIV screening done.

Despite this track record of ordering the wrong tests, Visalia Medical Clinic and it's staff claim I requested the testing. I have never once in my life disputed any testing with their clinic, except for the HIV prevalence test which never should have been ordered to begin with. I have had STD testing done multiple times over multiple years with Visalia Medical Clinic and never once disputed the charges for the tests. Yet when I request it, this institution insinuates that I am a liar and that I did request the testing. Which is false.

What bothered me most was they were not even willing to discuss it. They had made up their mind and were standing by their physicians. Despite a clear track record of a physician ordering the wrong tests.</Text><time>1533620938261<//time>< username>

I have been seen for many different problems and have always had great care, as for the people who say bad things I offer this advise you can't always be first and other people are just as sick and I'm sorry you have a boo boo. You will always be treated fair here at VMC, if you act like a jerk you will be treated as such.< /review>

<Text>I recently visited Dr. Jason Mihalcin at the Visalia Medical Clinic.  His staff was professional and friendly.  Dr. Mihalcin was attentive to my medical needs and took the time to listen to my  concerns and explain my options for care.  The overall experience relieved my anxiety and met my medical expectations.  I will definitely continue to use Dr. Mihalcin and the VMC.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

I feel four stars is pretty close to excellent. Five stars would leave no room for improvement . Anyway, the visits were better than expected, courtesy of the staff is pretty close to excellent, wait time is about average.
It is 30 mile ride for me,  but I decided that I will make it for this one Dr. We have many  qualified doctors in Hanford, but in this case I will stick with this one doctor. Although my experience with and opinions of Kaweah delta  hospital are extremely negative, as my stay there proved almost fatal due to Dr, Pharmacy, And nursing negligence,  I will still retain this doctor even though he is somewhat associated with Kaweah delta.</text>< response>

My 78 year old husband has prostate cancer. Traveling out of town to his urologist was getting too hard for him. Our primary doctor tried to get a referral for him to see Dr. Prah. Would not take him and will only tell us after reviewing his record chooses not to take his case. Obviously no compassion.< /Review>
