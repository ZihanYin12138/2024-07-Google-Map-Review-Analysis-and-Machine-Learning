<rating>4<//rating><text>New establishment, the staff are friendly and quick to greet and provide service. The flavor of the beans, chilaquiles, and salsa are very traditional home style. Portioned was great for the price.

Their menu does have an extinsive options of traditional D.F. Style cuisine. Definitely looking forward to return and try a new dish. The staff mentioned a tinga made out of Jamaica for vegeterian section. I have to admit I'm intrigued, I've heard of jamaica use as a replacement for meat, but never try it. I like the new exposure to the array of Mexican dishes outside of what we see in typical Mexican food establishments at a reasonable price.

The admosphere is casual. The restaurant is in a run-down area of town.< /text>< Pictures>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Does the thought of Sopes, Huaraches, Enomoladas, Enfrioladas, Chile Rellenós or Sopa de Fideo (just name a few) make your mouth water? Then this is the place for you!  The food here is authentic AF. The plates are so delicious and very homemade. Their salsas are awesome especially the Chile de Árbol. We had the Chicken Flautas and they were a meal in itself - done just like in CDMX. We also had the Enchiladas Verdes and the green sauce was incredible. The enchiladas were generously filled with chicken too. We also had a bowl of their Sopa de Fideo which was also very good. Actually it was awesome! I'm going to try and make my sopa de fideo like they do here - they kindly gave me their recipe.

So, if you're Jonesing for Tex-Mex or Cal-Mex food, this isn't the place. But, if you want truly incredible, authentic Mexican food, this is place for just that.

This place is new and family owned. The service was outstanding. Please do not hesitate - this is the real deal for authentic Mexican Chilango dishes. Your taste buds are in for a treat - you will not regret it.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOe0H_hmAHD_yZREyk2vJ-225tPdToGDox5TfEe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0bs0Tz81RmnQket46AgdA32qoxwWPrHTGKn2I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

<Review>One of those hole in the wall places.  Authentic, old Mexico D F  Style Mexican food.  Even Served Lengua.  They make or put together almost anything.   Prices are very reasonable.  Family run & operated.  The cook even sings along with the Mexican Music.  Good for a laugh!   Ask him to sign along, I told him I would mention him in my review.  Overall, very nice meal for a great price.  Very nice people there.  I hope you enjoy it.  Adios!  Don< /Review><gmapID>0x80c3531685285529:0x2eb9b978d866e59e< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<username>David Vargas<//username><text>I have been to this restaurant in several occasions, their service and the food are always excellent. My personal favorites are: Meatball soup, cecina and enfrijoladas (Corn Tortillas Dipped in Bean Sauce). In addition, they have “Comida Corrida” on Wednesdays, this include soup, rice and stew, the food is always fresh and made in a home-cooked manner, I highly recommend them.<//text>< pics>

A really solid find in San Bernardino. The surrounding area isn't pretty but Nopal is pretty clean inside. The entire dining room could use a facelift but is otherwise in solid condition. Customer service is good, the lady who helped us out was very friendly. Prices are also comparable to most other Mexican establishments so that's good.

I've eaten a lot (and I mean a lot) of Mexican food but I've never seen a "Pamborazo" on the menu. 9 out of 10 times I'd go with tacos or enchiladas but considering I'd never had this before I decided to try it. This Pamborazo is basically a torta dipped in guajillo sauce and it comes with beans, chorizo, potatoes, lettuce, queso fresco and sour cream. Typically I would find something to pick on but in this case I wouldn't change a thing on this sandwich. My wife's huarache de asada was pretty good but the taco and complimentary chips and salsa were ok.

All in all this was a very good food stop. Customer service was good, food was good and an old dining room. If I'm ever in the area again I would definitely come back for more.< /review>

I love mexican food and i can say this place isn't for me. I order two sope and it was $3 each on the menu. My girl order enchilada plate for $9 and quesadilla for $5. My total was nearly $35. WOW. I asked the lady that work there why is it so much and she told me they charge meat seperately. Extra $12 for meat. Another WOW. The worker didn't inform me about the extra charges and the food was old. Don't waste your time paying $$$ for food and getting tough hard meat. I won't recommend this place to anyone.</Review>

Wide variety of options that are not usually offered at a regular mexican food for example tostada de tinga! Yum!  Family owned makes it cozy and gives a relaxed vibe.  We ordered enchiladas verdes that came with rice and beans that tasted like homemade! Also chilaquiles with carne asada (we wish the carne asada wasn't tacos carne but an actual piece of steak) but it was delicious! Great service, very clean and over all a great experience!</Review>< pics>

< Review>
Came here with my hubby and we were pleasantly surprised. Everything is freshly made from scratch. Authentic D.F. Style cuisine. I had the flautas de res, which were extra long on a big plate. My hubby had enchiladas rojas de pollo with beans and rice and they were very flavorful.  The cafe de olla is the best!!!  There is plenty of good parking. The inside is very nice and spacious. It has D.F. decor, photographs inside which is beautiful to reminisce of Mexico City, an awesome place to visit.  The service is stellar too. Very nice owner who came over to speak to us. We highly recommend this restaurant.< /Review>

But not anymore since.the restaurant   Nopal   is now open.  We went yesterday and have huaraches and sopes and the flavor was perfect.  I would come every week to try the whole menu.

<Text>National grocery retailer selling farm fresh fruits and vegetables, oven baked bread, pastries and donuts, there's even an abundance of plants and flowers, not to mention an amazing selection of local wines and craft beers. There's even a Starbucks inside. It's truly a one-stop-shop.<//Text>< user_name>

Despite the fact that Southern California is supposed to be eco friendly, I'll make you a bet that you won't see anyone in line with a reusable bag. I'll also bet you're not using a reusable bag either. Really disappointing.<//Text>

<text>The bike rack (pretty bad design & insecure)  and has not been repaired in many months now. I don't know why, considering that this is a big business, and a decent designed bike parking is very much needed by cyclists in the area. You'll never be eco friendly if there's no infrastructure for cyclists, c'mon!< /text><Time>1607224901429</Time><UserId.>101334389794896134109</UserId.></record>

The store is well stocked and employees were friendly but as soon as I walked into the restroom I had to give 1 star. The restrooms both women and men's were very dirty. Right now with a virus going around you would think all areas of the store should. e clean. In the women's restroom all 3 stalls were overflowing with trash, floors and doors were dirty. The sinks looked like they hadn't been cleaned and moved hand soap whatsoever. They need to have employees going in there to clean constantly specially right now.</Review>

Debbie was obnoxious to me today. Then, following her example, Bobby, who took over her register, instead of diffusing the situation, continued to be absolutely condescending and obnoxious to me. Told me I was rude in front of other people. When I went back in to get his name he was still absolutely rude to me. NOT CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ALL. And I have been in customer service myself for 30 years. There are SEVERAL ways my situation COULD have been handled, but they chose to treat me in a condescending, disrespectful way in front of other people. I have posted public complaints on several sites already. Debbie and Bobby are horrible.</review>

Ralphs reminds me of Publix in Alabama - not quite as big, but they sell similar products.  This store is well managed, clean, well laid out and the staff are super helpful.  The quality of goods is great too.</Review>

I went to buy groceries the other day. I was behind a lady in the cashier. I overheard the cashier was talking to this lady. The cashier lady was talking to this lady in condescending manner. Very unfriendly. It was my turn, and yes. Same thing, she was talking to me in condescending manner, very rude and unfriendly. It is a shame her badge says : Front Manager Debra. She doesnt have customer service at all.</Review>

Cathy, the manager, was wonderful and they seem very settled and kind a this place. Much different than most of the customer service to be had these days. I called with a question and she delivered. So refreshing to see a service manager that handles the public and seems to do so with ease.</review>

<review>It is clean,  and that is the best thing I can say.
Their only organics are mixed in with everything else on the shelves, and they only have Kroger's Simple Truth brand. If you want chicken beasts or tenderloins they only have prepackaged "fresh" and nothing frozen.
They seem to be having a product war with the organics store across the lot. Maybe between the two a person could get all their shopping done?<//review>< gmapID>

Great, as usual. In town it's the best general grocery supermarket, miles ahead of Vons and Albertsons. Fruits and vegetables with good, predictable quality at honest prices, plus a wide assortment of all things home, make me just wish we had more stores in the Santa Barbara area than a measly two.</text>

Poorly stocked service deli. Being a chauffeur I've been to a lot of Ralphs. Any other Ralphs between here and LAX is great for quick lunch stops. Seems like all of the Ralphs in SB/Goleta area carry half as many things as one would expect of the chain.</text>

< Review>
08.27.15 I went there to buy some beer. And they refuse to sell it because I have International ID. It was me driving license with my photo and birth date. (matching with CA ABC law (Section 25660 Business and Professions Code). And when I started complaining about it with the chief manager. And ask here where I can I write this complaint in the store. She said: nowhere. And said if I continue to complaining she will call the police.
So if you don't like something in this store - be quite or they will call cops)
They didn't solve a problem, did not apologize.
I were a buyer of this store for 6 months, and I don't have any problems, and I liked to shop there. But i never come there again!< /Review>

I shop here fairly often, but this time I had trouble finding what I wanted. They had just 2 jicamas, both GIANT. No fresh mozzarella - you knows, the kind packaged in water. And finally the lettuce was all fading... Drove over top the other grocery store at Turnpike and found what I wanted. I usually skip this place because checkout is slower - but maybe all the other customers know something I just learned: better produce!</Review>

Recent,vand surprisingly, upscale developments have turned this location from the cold, pale, fluorescent lighted, grocery store into a rather locally grown aesthetic. Obviously mimicking whole foods and trader joes but not in an entirely bad way.

Great acai bowls, always freshly made. Would be 5 starts if they would be more reasonably priced. 10.00 for a bowl is a bit steep.< /Review>

Takes a long time as they are making so many online orders. This is the place to go for cleansing drinks, they are just okay with juices and smoothies.</Review>

<text>Love THIS Nekter ....But the one off main street downtown  Huntington is how can I say it TERRIBLE !!! .....the kids who work there are always High they Always mess up your order even though it is on the Receipt right in front of them when they make it SMH You have to watch them when they  make your juice because they won't put in everything that you ordered and paid for...its just poor service to say the least... And the place looks super run down water leaks in the ceiling when it rains Its  just very dirty and not taking care of at all with poor management //// Now THIS Nekter is AMAZING!!! clean the kids who work there are bright polite great energy always make my  juice or Smoothie CORRECTLY ... Actually sometimes they make my drink soon as I walk in the door without me even telling them what's in it .....There super on it & always polite And their 3day or  5 day detox Is so amazing!!!!!  I actually did a 10 day detox juice only!! &  was not hungry the entire time I felt AMAZING!!! you have to drink the juice every 2 hours for sure and water in between are u will get hungry But it cleans out your entire body u feel great its SO GOOD FOR YOU TO CLEAN OUT YOUR BODY AND DETOX  And I dropped like 15 to 20 pounds The  detox has  6 different juices that are completely different and they all taste great !! they help you in 6 different ways skin hair  Stomach bloating circulation and just your overall health i would  Suggest everyone to do this  to clean out your body and if you wanna lose weight this is definitely great way to do it healthy clean and nutritious I did 10 days but u can do a 1  one day cleanse 3 day 5 day what ever works for you but this Nekter and the staff are amazing it's a great place to start off ur day and be healthy my favorite drink is a 32oz Berry banana burst and I add  Pineapple Orange carrot kale spinach Bee pollen and bee protein it is simply delicious!!!!!! Juceing is the key of life it's  So healthy and nutritious for you and you  can't go wrong #BeEpic<//text>< response>

<review>Giving 3 stars because the juices and smoothies here taste great, but for $8 you can get a whole lot more food at a different place here in the Seacliff Center. The staff here sometimes isn't warm, but you can't expect much from younger kids. If I had to choose the best juice and Huntington Beach it would be Mother's market. For the same price you get all organic and a lot more variety to choose from. You know it will always be the highest quality on Mother's market. The juice here at nekter is all right, it's not my first stop for lunch or a quick snack.<//review><resp>None< /resp><pictures>None</pictures><Name>Stipe Lasić< /Name>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Love this place. When looking for an acai bowl, juice, or smoothie, this is the place to go. I recommend ordering online -through the rewards app- so you can simply walk up to the receiving end of the counter, and pick up your items. It can get very busy, but that is not a negative. It is because its good. :)<//Review>

Overpriced and crazy slow.  Read the reviews that food here can take a while but figured I only wanted a small juice, so how long could that take?!?! Nearly a half hour. For one small juice.  Compared to the local juice spot I usually go to in Los Alamitos, which has fewer workers and the same morning line, I have NEVER had to wait for a simple juice that long.  One would think a chain like this would have better processes in place.  I won’t be returning.< /review>

<Review>Organic juices smoothies açai bowls, I wish there were more places as fantastic as this. Slightly hard to find, inside a nutrition store. Seems reversed as vitality tap has the design, decor and aesthetic that should be the entire store with a section of "nutrition"....or leave the unnatural products out all together.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

The Acai bowls are delicious and the smoothies never disappoint. The staff however could do with much improvement. Although not rude, they consistently get orders wrong. Whether it's a misread order placed through their online system or a lack of awareness and attention when dealing with customers, this seems to be a regular occurrence at this location.</review>

<Text>Terrible experience at the Seacliff location. I ordered the banana berry bowl. I usually get it at the Bella Terra location. My bowl was very small and the acai mixture was thinner than a smoothie I had to drink it. When the guy handed it to me I told him it didn't look right. He shrugged his shoulders gave me a mean look and turned his back to me. Not going there any.ore. I gave a $1 tip also 😡<//Text>< Pictures>

< review>
The last 3 times I came here.... the employees are always bitter and rude.... The asain lady who helped me today is always very short with me. I asked a question about the"build your own" . . . And on the board it says.. ask one of our team members for help... I had no idea what to do , she just assumed I knew exactly what to do. Like as if I knew the options and procedure about being able to select a base, the types of fruits, and I asked about add ons or if 1 came with it, she was just like nope... Anyways long story shot. VERY rude service. Minimal convo, and single words exchanged only...Very black and white. I will be returning only because theres no other juice spots near...
The rude service almost makes the drink taste bad 😂<//review>

It's a good pie but sometimes they over cook it, and they don't pay attention to the tags , when it's a special pie , you get it how they want to make it. Light sauce you get heavy sauce, salad bar isn't that good  lettuce is all welted.</text>

Best Pizza of all time! I got the 16" super pizza thinking I would have leftovers. After the 5th slice I knew I was lying to myself. The pizza is so incredibly delicious. I ate the whole thing and then ordered one for my fridge. Pizza Plus you are absolutely delectable. Thank you for tasting so good!<//Text>

<Review>This place has gotten more expensive since new ownership.   It was disappointing that the soda machine has so many options for diet soda and they were all empty.  I was offered diet coke out of a 2 liter but I only wanted non-caffienated.  Luckily the grocery store was open and had options.</Review><time>1542049566525< /time>< Gmap_id>

<Response>{'time': 1542050966321, 'text': "Cheryl, thanks for the review. We strive to provide the very best product and service as possible to every customer. Of course, sometimes we fail. I'm sorry that we were temporarily out of diet soda options. We have been owned by the same family since 1993. Escalon is an expensive town to live and do business in and our prices will continue to keep pace with inflation and minimum wage laws."}< /Response></record>

I think the best Pizza Plus is in Sutter Creek. A lot of the others have gone downhill with the ingredients. The staff is friendly here though.< /Review>

Pooja made the whole process quick and easy,  been putting it off for years but finally got motivated to transfer our vhs wedding video to digital to watch on our 25th anniversary. If I knew it was this easy, I would have done it sooner.   Price was so reasonable, we got 2 copies, one original full length and a 2nd version in an editable format so we can cut down to a short 10 minute montage our kids won’t mind sitting through!   There are some services online but I didn’t want to risk the wedding tape getting lost in the mail.   Her SJ location is easily accessible.    Plus it’s good to support a small local family business.  Would recommend this service.< /Review>

Pooja is just amazing and then so kind on top of it!  I was worried about my 25 year old tape of my wedding and sure enough, the tape broke as soon as they put it in the machine. But Pooja saved it and for such a fair price. She has the contacts, the talent and the caring to digitize our family memories so they last a lifetime!< /review>

<Name>Robert H</Name><Date>1618689626836</Date><rating>5<//rating><review>Before contacting FMV, I did a fair amount of research to see what the average price was to convert mini DV tapes over to DVD. The range was pretty wide, and the turnaround time was at least a few weeks at best. My main concern was sending out all my tapes (36 of em!), without any backups if they were to get lost or destroyed in transit.

From my very first conversation with Pooja, I knew I was in good hands. Her rates are very competitive, and her production times are ridiculously FAST! A couple of my projects were urgent, and she managed to complete them a few days before the deadline.

If you have video footage laying around that could be deteriorating as the years go by, call FMV to get a quote. All this precious footage does nothing for us unless we can watch and share it with the folks that are near and dear to our hearts!</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I have nothing but good things to say about my experience working with Pooja. A couple winters ago, my father was very sick and I really wanted to convert my parents old reels of their wedding, and some old vhs tapes so that he could look back at all his old memories one last time. Pooja did not only show great empathy, she was able to get it all digitized very quickly through the holidays. My parents loved being able to watch their wedding for the first time in 50 years! There’s many businesses where you can ship your vhs tapes to have them digitized, but I prefer to take them to Family Memories. There’s no one I would trust more with my precious family memories.</Text>

I was happy with the results and thought she did a very professional job.
Much better than the slides I had converted from a company that I sent them too. Nice that she is in the neighborhood with easy access.</review>< pics>

I had 20-2hr 8mm home video tapes that Pooja transferred to a single thumb drive.  Very satisfied with the quality and prompt turnaround.  There were 2 tapes that were damaged, which she repaired.  If this work was done mail order, surely I would not have copies of those videos.  Thanks Pooja</Review>

Yesterday I called to inquire about the transfer of an old DVD to MP4. I expected to leave a message, because it was Friday, and likely wait until perhaps Monday to get a response. I also had planned to call at least two places. However, my call was answered immediately, an appointment was made for the next day and I was told I could wait and get the finished product due to the short duration. I called no one else. This is a family operation through and through, but with a professional level of service evident in the entire interaction. I don't think I've ever been offered refreshments before in a situation such as this, but I was, and the brief amount of time from start to finish made the reasonable price spent cost-effective.<//Text>

Professional, dedicated and simply kind hearted is what you get from Pooja at "FMV"

I took my VHS cassette and had it converted to a mp4 and was extremely satisfied at how fast she did it and how she was also able to repair the vhs tape.

I highly recommend Family Memories Video to anyone that wants to cherish old videos!!</review>

We just converted my husband's only VHS tape from his childhood to a digital file, and we are so excited to view it.  She was able to take care of it within the same day (only took less than a couple of hours). She allowed us to preview the tape to make sure there was footage on it. She also helped us fix the audio track and crop the video parts that were blank.

The operation is run like a small side hustle out of her home, and she was so welcoming and we felt instantly comfortable with her.

If we can dig up more memories, we'd be sure to bring it by here again.

This is a much better option than bringing it to Costco in my opinion.<//Text>

When I went to Family Memories Video for video tape digitization of the VHS and Hi8 memories of my family, I was not looking for a cheap send it and forget it big box dot com solution.

I wanted the best quality conversion of the old media to ensure the best possible outcome. I also did not want my tapes to be sent somewhere else where I could loose something that I could never replace.

With Family Memories Video, they more than exceeded my expectations!</review>

Pooja did a great job converting two VHS tapes onto DVD and to .mp4 files for me.  She has many years of experience and lots of specialized equipment that enables her to produce a great result.  She converted a compliation of childhood videos and a record of a rafting trip down the Colorado River.  On the rafting video there was poor sound quality on the first coversion.  She figured out what the problem was and did a second conversion with very good sound.  She really cares about producing a good product!</Review>

Extremely gracious and accommodating. Love that is a woman owned business.  Found my daughters videos from her childhood that had been gathering dust and we could not even watch them any more.  She magically put all the videos together even with different formats. She did is quickly and very organized.  She is prompt in getting back to you and provides excellent service. I am enjoying the hours of memories she created.  She has a studio in her home and it is easy to find.  Better to shop local<//text>

<review>I called this place on a whim, asking if they sell vhs adapters, they said they didn't, but called me back 10 minutes later saying to come and borrow theirs. I am absolutely floored by the kindness of this business owner. She was so patient teaching her daughter as she did the transferring process (I ended up digitizing an old home video with her after having problems with our VCR) and it was super quick! She was also so flexible about pick up times, and really I am just so thankful she keeps her business so personable! Definitely get your tapes digitized with her, don't forget to bring your own usb drive hehe :)</review>< pics>

I am so glad that I found Family Memories Video!  I had 16 old 8mm tapes filled with precious family moments, and no way to view or save them.  I searched Google, and found Pooja!   She was able to transform my old video tapes into digital mp4, which I will be able to share with my family and friends forever!  Pooja is amazing, not only did she complete the job quickly and an efficiently, she was also able to repair 2 of my damaged tapes, and now they are safe on a USB (bring your own with you), and ready to backup on a home computer, and save on ICloud.  I would recommend Pooja to everyone, she is well skilled, and a lovely person!< /text>

She made an excellent CD from a very old and unused VHS tape. I was very impressed with the quality of work and the promptness of the delivery. I shall recommend her to all my friends!

What a wonderful find! Pooja did a great job of transferring a VHS tape to DVD. Not only was her service great, but when I explained the rush I was in she offered to do it right away. She called me 1 1/2 hours later and told me it was ready. Thanks to Pooja's understanding, I was able to take the DVD right to the post office for overnight shipment. The quality of the transfer is 5 star. Thanks for a wonderful experience. I will be back and I will certainly relate my experience to my friends who may be in need of her services.< /Text>

I had a great experience.  Pooja is a wonderful person and so sweet.  She brought me in and let me look at the videos before transferring them.  She also got this done in about 2 hours.  I was ready to go!  She was efficient and did a great job.  Very careful with an important video, so I was very pleased.  Can not say enough good about her.  DO NOT be concerned about her having a home business.  That is a non issue and allows for personal care and safety of your video.  I will use her again for sure!</Review>

She exceeded what I needed to pull from a 25 yr old video which made the event incredibly special. She not only gave me what I asked for but at the same time turned it into a gift that will be shared in a new way. I will be using her again and highly recommend her.</Review>< GmapID>

I came to Family Memories Video because I've read the great reviews on here. Pooja definitely lives up to these reviews. She is very genuine, communicative, and has a great work ethic. She works out of her home so at first I was not sure I was at the right place, but when she opened the door she was very welcoming and explained the process to my boyfriend and I in great detail. We brought some old family videos and I brought in a VHS of my parents' wedding which I was very excited to see. One of the tapes was broken and she explained to me how it was probably broken and was able to send it to a friend of hers to get it fixed. After the videos were rendered, she told me how big the files were going to be so I can bring a thumb drive big enough to fit all of the files. When I got there to receive the files, she went over the videos with me, and one of them was actually glitching out so she went and re-rendered it for me. The broken tape was recovered perfectly. I am very happy with the results. I greatly recommend Pooja's service and will absolutely be coming back if I dig up some more VHS tapes to get digitized. Thank you Pooja!<//review>

<review>I called Family Memories Video the afternoon before I needed to get two old family video tapes transferred to DVDs for our son. I was told to come on over and it would be done. Turned out both tapes were damaged but they made them work. The DVDs are wonderful. I highly recommend this family company. I will go back with more old movies and tapes when I get more organized.<//review>< pictures>

Pooja is awesome! She was able to convert an over-a-decade-old VHS tape. I love that she works from home because she is available whenever you need her. I needed this tape done ASAP as my dad was flying out the next day. Usually companies take up to a week to convert your tapes into DVD, but it only took her a few hours. She called me right away to let me know the DVDs were done so I could come pick them up. Her daughter is also very cute! I highly recommend her.<//review>

Recently I needed to digitize several hours of 15+ years old PAL records, and FMV's service was truly outstanding, on all levels.

In particular:

* Super fast delivery.

* Extremely flexible work hours.

* An option to produce uncompressed files that preserve the highest possible quality and let you edit the video on your computer afterward.

My advice to the prospective customers: Please do not get worried by the fact that this business is being run out of a home office. Just call first to discuss your needs, and the treatment you get will be more professional and courteous than what you get from many "big businesses", at least according to my experience.

Oh, and did I mention that the pricing was more than fair? ;-)

Thank you so much, Family Memories Video!</text>

Called today and was able to drop my VHS tape off same day!  When she told me she could have it finished in as little as 3 hours I was so excited.  When she called me an hour and a half later to say it was finished I was even more pleased.  Fast, friendly service.  I brought my DVD home popped it in and the quality and sound was great.  I spoke with a few other video services and was not impressed at all.  They all shipped the tapes somewhere else.  I don't know about you buy my family memories are to valuable to possibly be lost in the mail.  Give Family Memories Video a call you will be glad you did!< /Review>

I have been looking for someone to convert my VHS videos to DVDS. I was thrilled to find Pooja Chordia's business. I explained the problems that I had had going to another business and getting a blurred jumpy  DVD back.  Within 30 minutes of leaving her home she called me and said my that my tape was in great shape. She completed my order in 24 hours. Her work is of high quality. Chordia is an extremely knowledgeable smart lady. She is direct, honest and wants her customers to be satisfied with the final product.

I will  be returning to her and highly recommend this business without any reservations!!!!</review>

I must tell you I have never dealt with such a wonderful and prompt company like Family Memories Video.
I needed to transfer a memorable old VHS to a movie file (YouTube) pretty quickly.  This movie was very important to me because it was a tribute to my best friend late wife. I called Family Memories Video after receiving the news.  It was on a Saturday afternoon at 12 noon when I got an email. I called Family memories that day to ask how long it takes to convert VHS to YouTube file. She told me to go the office and bring the tape.  After driving 20 minutes, Puja checked the tape and asked what is the most important moment would I like to capture. After providing the information.   She said she can finish the conversion in couple hours.
I went to pick up the finish conversion within couple hours. She gave me the whole copy of my VHS to DVD and the YouTube file.
Rarely these days you cannot find a service that is quick like a BLINK OF AN EYE.
Before going to Family Memories Video, I checked other chain store  and it takes 2 or 5 days for the conversion and the price is expensive.
You are a wonderful company Family Memories Video and her lovely daughter greets you with a big smile and hug.
Family Memories Video has a reasonable price compare it to other business out there.
If you need quick service and quality this is the place to go.
I rate this Family Memories Video 5 Star.</text>

Pooja,
Thank you for your expert assistance in converting a disk into seventeen DVDs for our family as well as the conversion of the cassette tape into a DVD.

I really appreciate your guidance through the process it took for the conversion, the suggestion of adding the high definition for a great overall picture, the added introduction photo, removing the clicks so the DVD may run continuously and especially the extra time you spent to make all this happen.

Your positive demeanor really showed through the couple of times we met and I thank you immensely for this.

In life one may forget what you said, one may forget what you did, but usually one will never forget how you made them feel.

So how fortunate my family is to have this remembrance that makes saying goodbye to our love one so very hard.

You will always stay high on my list of recommendations for someone needing this type of service.

Thank you so very much,

Vanessa</text>

I am happy to add another five-star review! Pooja returned my call within seconds, and then invited me to drop off my VHS-C tapes as soon as I could. I gave her four VHS-C tapes of various lengths and asked if I could get them transferred to DVD in less than a week. She transferred them in less than 48 hours! I am thrilled with the result. The price was reasonable and the service excellent. I will be going back as soon as I dig out all my old VHS tapes!</Text>

<response>None<//response><text>Pooja was thoughtful, communicative, and accurate as she carefully brought new life to video (film) that had not been viewed by my family since 1961.  After trying a different service and getting low quality results, I looked for another option and learned about Happy Family Memories Video and Pooja, the owner.  Pooja worked with me to understand the importance of the film to our family and assured me that she would work carefully to get the best quality results from the film possible.  She did not disappoint.  The result was not only a super high quality job, but also a terrific experience for my family.  I trust Pooja, and will certainly use her company again.< /text><pics>None</pics><userid>113996216432665780017</userid></record></dataset><record>

<text>The most effective video transfer service I have ever used.  Quick and reliable, safe and professional. I completely recommend Family Memories Video if you are in need of digitizing many other kinds of cassettes to DVD.

Very good experience. Excellent result, Conversion of 1998 20 min vhs interview of my father who was 87 at the time. And, service was great. Very friendly and great outcome. The dvd was done in  30 min while I waited in their living room - enjoying conversation with their 3 yr old daughter. I highly recommend Family Memories.< /Review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Amazing service! I asked Pooja to convert my parents home videos on VHS to DVD. One of the first things she said when I took the tapes to her was that she understands how precious and irreplaceable they are and she would take good care of them. I had one tape that was damaged/twisted and she fixed it so it plays perfectly and the transfer was seamless too. For the price, can't be beat. It's comparable in price to big box stores and they mail the VHS tapes away which I was not comfortable with. Pooja had an extremely quick turnaround too! I had 14 tapes. We started with just 3 and she did those in 1 day. Then the next 11 only took 4 days. Amazing! She's so friendly and kind too. Highly recommend! I will use her in the future too!!!< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Text>The video was seamlessly done using some old family movies my father had taken.  Pooja is so friendly and easy to work with and her skills are such that there would have been no way that I could have done anything even close on my own.  The final result was definitely a big hit with my family.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

My husband's grandma passed away recently and we had a CD with her talking on it and a compilation of her favorite songs so we decided to make copies and give them to family members as a remembrance gift. Pooja made us multiple duplicates of the CD and she also placed a picture of her, songs, and "In Loving Memory" lettering on the CD's. We couldn't be more pleased and grateful.

<username>Peter Finter</username><Review>It was a pleasure working with Pooja to transfer our precious family films & videos (including 50 year old Super8 cine film, 25 year old VHS video and 15 year old MiniDV) into uncompressed digital files (easier to edit later).

Pooja took the time to review all the media before starting conversion, and explained exactly what she would do, and by when.   We were all very pleased with the results, and were so glad we'd eventually got around to doing it.

I used Family Memories Video to convert 2 VHS tapes to DVD.  It was pretty simple, but I needed them in a rush.  Pooja let me come over early Saturday morning and drop them off.  Then when we found out my request was a bit harder than I had originally thought (because there was a lot more video), Pooja still completed the job promptly and it was done by noon. In a nutshell, outstanding service.<//review>

<Text>My friend passed away a few years ago and I had his celebration of life at my house.  Pooja and her husband snapped photos and videos of the celebration and then Pooja put them all together into a video with music and some artwork.  She did an incredible job, focused on the wonderful pictures of my friend, along with pictures from that day.  Adding the music was a wonderful touch and now this memory will live on for all of us who loved him!  Thank you Pooja for your wonderful work!< /Text>< Pics>

My mom recently gave me a storage bin full of old filmed home movies from the 60's and 70's.  There were three different kinds of films and sizes.  I had trouble getting some of these developed from places like Costco.  I called Pooja and she said she would be able to convert all of my parents' movies from film to DVD ( from when they were kids and teenagers).  The quality is amazing.  The film is over 50 years old and she was able to convert it to DVD.  My family was so happy to see these films.  I have brought Pooja over 75 rolls of film in the last few months to transfer.  The videos are made in a timely fashion and the address is close to my house in San Jose.  If I get any more family films from my mother I will definitely take it to Pooja to be transferred to DVD.  I was very satisfied with her video transfer service.</review>

< Review>
Pooja did a wonderful job converting my vhs to a dvd yesterday.  I am so excited to be giving the dvd to my step-son for Christmas that is over 25 years ago of his 8th grade graduation!  Pooja was professional, cordial, and I will go there to do my next vhs conversions!< /Review>

<review>Stopped in to play pool and have a beer, we couldn't sit at the bar due to the only 2 seats available had a rag in front of them on top of the bar soaking up blood. I guess we had just missed a fight prior to us arriving. It was so hot inside that I had to go outside 5 times in the 45 minutes that we were there. I had a paper towel from the bathroom that I was using to wipe my face and neck off because the sweat was pouring down my face. Very uncomfortable environment tonight.< /review>< Pics>

Hole in the wall, we don't want you to think it is any decent bar...Certainly indecency is welcomed in this OldBird. It no longer exists, unless you really find yourself actually  walking in the Turkey Inn. 1pool table, and wise age bar tending.<//Review>

Good price on drinks! Games & juke box music!The bartenders are mellow & do their job well! Super small town, everyone knows everyone! It's been around here awhile so its well known. Their beer on draft is AMAZING! Def check it out one night. Easy to find, right next to circle K, parking in back!<//Review>

Best place for cocktails in Ramona! Even first timers are treated like family. It's not fancy...but a great place to spend some time. Pool table, 2 soft tip dart boards. Awesome bartenders. But Don't sit in the red chair<//Text>

My husband got assaulted for no reason at the Turkey....not a big fan...not sure why dogs are allowed either.   Never know what your gonna experience there.  Probably would never go there other than pool league. Sorry but that's the way I feel about the place.</Text>

<Rate>3<//Rate><review>Your typical small town local bar/pool hall. The ceiling is very high, not a lot on the walls to absorb sound so it's like a echo chamber. However, the customers are friendly & the drinks are a decent pour at a fair price. If your looking for some local "flavor" with your drink, I recommend this place.<//review>< Pictures>

Meh...... what can I say but dive bar. I only went here because my friend moved back to town and that's where she wanted to go. This bar had a bad rap for many years of being a motorcycle gang bar and it's not like that anymore but still if I wanted to go out to a bar this would not be my first choice.</Review>

Gone downhill since Shilo Glass was fired from bartending. But he was a dug addict, drug dealer, and tweaked out thief...Hole in the wall. Dive bar. Has one pool table. Michelle is now the best bartender on the Turkey tap.< /Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Went there before a show at the Ramona Mainstage (Tab Benoit) .. Drinks are cheap and STRONG!!
Definitely the way to go for pre-concert primers because the venue drinks are WAY expensive and they only have beer & wine.
I absolutely recommend the Turkey Inn!!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

He was amazing w my 14 yr old daughter. He was patient and caring. Our first apt he took time and explained why the piercing she originally wanted wouldn't work for her ear and even though it lost a sale, he was fine with us taking the time to think over our next move. She came back today, got her new piercing, and loves it!< /review>

Went in with a friend on Thursday, Rob was so awesome! Very friendly and informative. Answered all our questions and even told us to call the shop if we had any doubts. He had many options of jewelry to chose from. 4 days later our piercings are healing nicely. We will definitely go back to him for our next piercings. Hands down best service and atmosphere is welcoming. Definitely recommend.<//review>

These 4 stars are for piercer who changed my jewelry for cheek piercings ... she is very knowledgeable and confident in her work. She also done cheek piercings on her own ... so it was very easy for her to answer all of my questions. She is amazing.

One star I took off because the shop is too overpriced I bought nose hoop for 16$ here which I got for only 10$.
Reply to your response :  I got my one side ear pierced and nose piercing and then change of cheek jewelry  and I bought jewelry from here too ( I had nose are piercing around more then 6 months and cheek piercing jwelry change last month ) it is for this business ... Always there is female who helped me in the piercing room.< /text>

Most professional piercing shop in area. Cost a little more than other shops in the area, however the many years of experienced piercers, absolutely sterile equipment and environment, makes it well worth every penny. The jewelry selection consists of the highest quality available in the industry. I've had nine piercings over the years and seriously don't trust anyone else, but Mystical.< /text>

I've been getting pierced by Rob at Mystical Body for the past 10 years. This shop carries the best quality jewlery in the business, takes cleanliness and sanitation extremely seriously, and Rob is a very knowledgeable, talented and experienced piercer. He's easy to talk to and cares not only about the initial piercing, but the entire life of your piercing. If at any time you're having a problem with your piercing or jewlery, come back in and Rob will happily help you out. This is hands down the best piercing establishment in Northern California, I have only had great experiences here in the past 10 years and highly recommended them.<//review>

Rob is awesome, he genuinely cares and takes the time. He is really good at keeping you relaxed and has the best rates I've seen anywhere near the bay, and for actual quality. Most people wouldn't agree to do cheeks and he did it no problem and they are healing wonderfully. Hell watch you smile, sit back and see how your face moves to ensure he gets it just where it should be.Wont go back to anyone else from now on</Text>

From  stepping foot into the shop, until I stepped out, the experience was grea. Rob explained the procedure very well and offered advice and tips to get the best out of my piercing.  He was very professional and talked to me the whole time to get my mind off of the nervousness I had towards the needle.   I have already recommended him to a friend. Keep up the good work and thank you!</Text>

I'm quite iffy about the pricing for the piercings paid 100 for one ear cartilage piercing, lobe piercing, and the jewlery. However, it's quite explainable. Very clean, professional, and sanitized in the shop. I don't regret paying. My piercings are healing quite quickly.<//review>

<Review>Rob is the best!  I have come here numerous times now and he is the ONLY person I trust to make my ears look amazing.  It's so clean in his shop and he has a wonderful demeanor.  He makes you feel very comfortable and will evaluate the area you would like pierced before committing to it.  Too many piercing shops are too anxious to consider your anatomy, but not Rob.  The photo is of my Daith at less then 24 hours old with titanium jewelry (he also did my Helix and 2nd lobe in this ear).  Thank you again Rob, you're the absolute best.<//Review><Date>1564093836507< /Date><gmapID>0x809053f3fa547e03:0xd25d5f25d2ccd0a1< /gmapID></record>

What an awesome experience! Rob has a warm, friendly personality and is very patient and helpful. Clean environment and great jewelry selection. He made the process as comfortable as possible. Highly recommend this shop if you are serious about getting a professional piercing. Thanks again!</text>

He found the old piercing site and was able to restretch the area and put the barbell back through. It already feels like it's healing better than an initial piercing. I will be going back.<//Review><rating>5< /rating>< userid>

<text>I went to Emerald recently to get my nose stud changed to a hoop and did not have a good experience, so I was looking elsewhere for a new hoop and came across this nice little shop! The owner was awesome and super helpful—he gave me great tips and even changed my hoop for me. I highly recommend!<//text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<text>I love this place! I have gotten all of my piercings here and I highly recommend! The piercer is very professional and educated in his practice! I couldn't speak more highly of this shop! Rob, the owner, cares for his costumers and will tell you if your body is suitable for the piercing or not. He saved my ears from getting pierced by a bad shop and I literally can not speak more highly of this man and his amazing costumer service and love for his costumers! I recommend this shop over any in the Modesto area!< /text>< pics>

<text>What can I say! Eat fresh! They have a new tuna melt, not to fond of it. They put in a paper bag and put it in the oven. When you open it up it's quite the mess. Other than that it's all good.< /text>< GmapID>

This particular Subway in Quincy, CA rarely has more than one employee working at a time. It is regularly a very long wait. They run out of things very often also. Mayonnaise one visit, meats and cheeses and veggies another visit. Don't stop here if you're in a hurry. Almost always a 15-20 minute wait. Really sad since Quincy is so small. Very poor management.</Text>

<Text>The gal working there at 8:25 last Friday night says they close in 10 minutes. We say but your door and thr website says you close at 9pm. She says yeah but I have training to do so...
Then she says we can sit in lobby while she does training. Then more people come in and she makes a call and says after she hangs up that we can stay til 9 because they moved the training to tomorrow.
Then she makes my sandwich a chicken teriyaki on Italian herbs bread, with the guy's ahead of of me. He's having two sandwiches made. This makes mine soggy by the time she gets to making mine. It wasn't a good experience and Subway usually does better than that.<//Text><user>112937717465689453376</user><response>None</response><GmapID>0x809cfecbe13a4ce1:0xb52462429d3a223c< /GmapID>< user_name>

Employees have greatly improved. I'm very proud of them because I had initially decided not to return to this Subway, but they keep making it better and better. Customer service is on point. They could stand to learn how to use the coupons still, but otherwise, have made a complete turnaround.< /Text>

< Review>
The last time that I eat at a Subway was 4 years ago. I had a Tuna fish Sandwich.
Sick for days. Belching like A Truck Driver.
It was the Only Chain Junk food Restaurant.
I had eaten at other  Subways in California all the time and Never a Problem.</Review>

<Review>The Employees where friendly and worked  efficiently. Some tables needed wiped though.The wait was not long at all. The chicken wrap was not what I expected, instead of it being Chunks of rotisserie chicken like it shows in the picture, it was super fine shredded smashed up mushy chicken.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Staff is very friendly and I would love going here to eat more often but the make line is always a mess and that really grosses me out.</Review>

Place meets all your needs, money orders, package pick up. Yes, the lines are long but isn’t every post office? Folks make it slow not the staff. But, everyone should anticipate that and give a bit of flexibility. When you really think about it the cost to get this delivered to your door versus you dropping it the package off at any location yourself truly shows dedication from staff and the cost effectiveness of what you pay.</review>

Bryan & Matt are the most unprofessional, lazy, unaccomplished and rude workers for usps. They lie for eachother and I would not trust my mail going through this post office. I got a P O. Box somewhere else in order to never deal with these incompetent people that should be fired because they do not need job security treating people the way they do and stand behind the name United States Postal Service.< /text>

There is always a wait at all of the USPS offices but this location has the best customer service I’ve ever experienced out of all the locations I have visited.
Every single person who worked there was attentive, patient, and extremely pleasant!

This location has huge lot for customer parking as well. The area is not as clean as some other ones and there are a few homeless people who seem to hang out there sometimes.< /Review>

We trust the United States Postal Service with our mail and packages to get them delivered to us safely and on time. Lately some of the carriers are lazy and do not pay attention to addresses especially when apartments are involved. They continually leave my packages at the building next door to despite the addresses being different. There is no one to call and get this straightened out because they act like they just don't care. Filing a claim for the packages that are lost is also a waste of time because it is the rare occasion that they even look for them or find them. If they don't get this fixed soon only junk mail will save them.< /text>

Chris from Zone 4 has the worst customer service. My package was "delivered " according to a tracking device but when I looked in my mail box after "delivery " it wasnt in my mail box. I filed a claim, Chris said 99.9% of the time it will get denied. That it's my word against theirs. These nothing they can do for me. He said hes not sure if it was delivered to the correct mailbox and that they are just the post office, they dont know everything... if anyone has issues with this location I recommend to go to the Post Master at the main post office<//text>

<text>Lylac,has given my employees the worst service ever. Not only to my employees but also to other customers. Lylac was asking a Hispanic lady to write the Mexico address in English on the envelop." The letter is going to Mexico the address should be in Spanish as it appears in the Mexico address". She gives the worst Service every time.</text>< Resp>

Dropped off a package 3 days ago was to be delivered here in Fresno so it should be a quick delivery I look up the tracking status and only says shipping label has been printed. What terrible service. Never again will I ship items there. Usually I go to the Fig Garden Post Office never had a problem like this there.< /text>

<review>I thought getting a PO Box would be more secure in getting my mail since my mailbox had been broken into several times! I had a package sent to my PO Box that was never received and they told me they placed it in my box.  I'm the only one with a key and I never got it! The manager was basically calling me a liar and said that it couldn't have been put in a box by mine by mistake because those are vacant.  The manager was rude and someone is lying about delivering my box!!!!< /review>< userid>

<text>The manager is the worst person you will ever meet. She is almost crazy and yelling on customers. I cannot believe that how she deals with people on this way she should be punished for her bad behavior. Customers should be respected.

< Review>
Have never had a good experience with this post office. Sadly this is the one all my mail comes through they have marked "delivered" on multiple packages that I did not receive and then told me there was nothing they could do and that I was lying to them about receiving them. The people at the front desk are ok, but if you have to deal with the customer service door then you will wait at least 10 minutes and there will probably be a long line. I have never been treated so poorly at a post office.

After turning them into the Postal Inspection Services one of my packages was magically found.</Review>

< Review>
I've had a box for a while. Since I use the box as my banking address they won't let me do online payments. I sent a check when I got the bill in the box, and then a full month later, I had the bank freeze my checking when someone stole one of my checks FROM THE MAIL - and lazy lazy lazy jerks finally got around to cashing my check, and it bounced! I figured the thing cleared already! and then they stuck the notice in the LOCKED BOX I COULD NOT ACCESS instead of emailing me (they manage to email the bill I suppose only because it is automated to do so) or calling me or (gasp) sending the notice to my home address, which is of course on file but beyond their ability to go through and find??? what? So lost revenue for my small business, no doubt mail returned to customers, and they won't let me reopen the box without making me pay a $25 fee despite the fact that NONE OF THIS is my doing, or in my control. NO customer consideration whatsoever.<//Review>

I've had A LOT of my mail disappear, damaged or opened and many packages marked as delivered but never showed up. Or they lie saying that they tried to deliver it but I had proof that they didn't. The mail person just blames their fellow employees saying they didn't work those days. They haven't been fired either. This place needs to be investigated!</Review>

They lost another package. No call back from postmaster. Over 30 minute wait times with phone hang ups. A total joke of a postal department . People should be terminated here because the service is poor and wait times for anything is ridiculous.  Prostitute and homeless hanging out just confirms what's going on .<//text>

<text>Their is a pan handler at the front door and the post master does nothing about it. The gentlemen that helped me at the parcel pick up window was rude, the signs or instructions on the pickup card are not clear. I wasted 2 hours of my day picking up a certified letter. The hours should be posted on the card the on a large sign.</text></record>

(Translated by Google) They helped me with my parcel shipments, they suggested the best way to send things and they were kind.

I needed an item for next day event,  forget about Amazon Prime.  They can't help me this fast.   I called this location after going to their competitor that didn't have the item.  Nikita was wonderful 👏 She asked her co-worker if they have it then physically went down the aisle to confirm that it was in stock.  By the time I got to the store, she had it up front waiting for me.  Thank you so much Nikita and Mission Valley Party City!</review>

Party City is actually the Party World. You imagine, they have it, and even more. All kinds of themes, candies, plates, balloons, wigs, costumes...incredible variety and the team is always friendly and helpful. Last party I went was the Oscar and I found these sophisticated cups for my passion fruit mousse. So glamours. Even the gold tray. I also got the napkins and mini Oscar. So cool.</Text>

<text>I was looking for 70's theme outfits which stated online was there, but the selection wasn't at all great. A few small size lady ballerina too toos, wigs, etc... Not much clothing as I'd expected.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

The store only gave military discount for certain items and the discount is not calculated in the Total amount, but for the individual items, which make it worthless</Text>

<review>Well stocked and firendly staff. They helped me get everything I needed for a last minute party and even showed me what mylar balloons were clearance that would match my theme! The clerks there knew that they were bday appropiate fiesta theme balloons and when they didn't have some that were in stock they called other stores to find them and put them on hold for me.

<Text>It’s really neat inside, everything is organized, and the staff are really nice to you even to people with my mean-mug gin’ face. 😂 I came in looking for Easter eggs... during Thanksgiving. So, I didn’t get them, but I was amused to see how big and clean the place was. I’m pretty sure if you are looking for something during the RIGHT HOLIDAYS, you’ll find them here.< /Text>< Pictures>

Well they treated my partner well and gave her refunds on the things we didn’t even use for the party. And even for the balloons that where not made in time even with an order days previous. It wasn’t even at this store but they stand behind their good name so I respect that as a customer.<//Review>

My experience at Party City was quick and fulfilling. I stopped by with the intention of finding Pride supplies, and found them conveniently located in the front of the store. I found a selection that exceeded my expectations, and purchased a lot of fun stuff. Staff was pleasant and quick with the checkout. I plan on returning for my party needs.< /Review>

Store was very busy, but kept pretty organized despite all the chaos. The staff does their best to help customers as quickly and as efficiently as possible, but it would be much easier if they had an official waiting line. Lots of cutomers that were waiting to checkout, did not even know where to stand.< /review>

Yes, they've got balloons!  My wife and I just picked up several for a Valentine's-Day-theme dance.  They were busy with customers but still got the balloons filled (w/ helium) within a decent amount of time!  If we ever are in the area and need balloons or other party supplies, we know where to go!</Review>

I really want to thank the employees here because they were super helpful and patient with me. However the manager Maria really should get a refresher course on customer service. I was trying to get ringed up on a faulty chip reader and despite the employee being patient and trying again and again. Her first words to me are its a you problem YOU need to call YOUR bank. It has nothing to do with us or me. When asked to move to a different register she complied and funny enough it worked. No apology no thank you no nothing. Ok, little awkward it was obvious it wasn't my cards fault or my banks.

Arriving to my work, I realized she didnt pack up half the stuff I bought, I called and it was apparently on the counter just sitting there. So not only did I get an attitude when inquiring about the chip readers but I also bought a bunch of stuff I have to go back and get because she didnt put it in the bag.</text>

Worst service ever, waited on hold for 15 minutes then they hanged up the line, kept calling back and they never answered then they came out and took another vehicles order that had just arrived, they had also given my order to someone else so I had to wait additional time because of it, try to order from any other Party City except this one not recommended at all<//review>

< Review>
Weird experience here. I come in and get yelled out to leave my bookbag at the front. Meanwhile there were people in the store carrying bags and purses?? I bring my book bag everywhere to carry things and have never once been told to "leave it at the front." The check out lady was friendly enough but everyone else seemed to have a chip on their shoulder. Also very warm inside, no air conditioning. I came in  to get wrapping paper, tissue paper and ribbon for my mom's birthday and was disappointed at the selection of wrapping papers. They had all the cartoons and plain colors, but for "Party City " that should have had a more extensive selection. Gave them my bag and got what I needed but I wont come here again.</Review>

I had always come to this particular store they had always been curtious.  But this past Thursday I had the worse customer service, an a gets worse because a was from management.  Her excuse for ignored me and  my daughter for approximately 5 minutes was "I'm sick" . I ask her are you mad?. When I requested help on the bollons area she looked very upset,  this is not what customer service is all about, she should it stay home instead.</text>

Prices were okay, but somewhat limited on certain objects like candles. My main concern was that I bought about 15 balloons and asked the girl behind the counter to fill them up for me. She was polite, but very distracted when another coworker who was also a friend came to "help." They seemed more interested in gossiping about people while doing their job that they didn't fill up my balloons all the way. All of the balloons are on the floor of my living room not even twelve hours later. For the price very disappointed and most likely will not return for any party needs again.< /review>< Pictures>

They were out of colors. Seeming like they couldn't handle being a store that sells balloons. Underwhelmed staff. 4 employees and still not efficient.< /Review>

This location is horrible . Every time I come in , which isn’t often they have one person helping the whole line . The last time the one cashier was still in training . It took me
Forever . The manager was there and didn’t step in just continued to blow up balloons , I had a party to set up . If I could give it 0 stars I would.<//text>

Great food, great service. Fast service too considering I went during the dinner rush hour. It seems a bit pricey at first but the food is definitely worth it! Tons of options and a few unique burgers too. I believe they also have vegetarian burgers as well which is a nice inclusion to have for vegetarian people.
Outdoor dining during Covid is nice although it can feel a little cramped but definitely one of the better restaurants to go to during this time. They have a firm grip on the situation and have barriers between tables as well which I haven't seen in many other places.</Text>

Delicious burgers and great service. There's a wide variety of burgers as well as beyond burgers for the vegetarians out there. It's really appreciated how they have a lot of choice for patties as well as sandwiches if you're not looking for a burger. Service was also exceptionally fast which was a pleasant addition to the dining experience<//Text>

Why: So in hopes of finding a new "The Melt" in Berkeley after it closed on Telegraph Ave I decided to try this place out.

Notes: Atmosphere was amazing so cute and beautiful for a restaurant.

Food: Huge Huge Huge sandwich portions. I was pretty surprised that they brought me a huge plate of sandwiches for a 1 order. Fries where very well cooked they were also a huge portion. Great portions for what your paying for.

Will come back here !< /Review>

<Review>Barney's is good. California burger with grilled poblano chile, jack cheese and 6 strips of bacon. Really couldn't believe they put so much bacon on my burger, that was totally awesome! French fries were very good, excellent portion. My server was great, refilled my ice tea three times. I definitely recommend Barney's on Shattuck.<//Review>< Pictures>

This Barney's the most popular one situated heart of Berkeley even a mile away from cramping downtown.
Foods and atmosphere is always exiting. Also the outside patio's cool sufficient place to enjoy. Very American👍< /review>

Good basic menu of salads and burgers. I highly recommend the Chinese Chicken Salad or the Salmon Burgers. Both are freshly prepared to order  and full of natural flavor. The steak cut fries are the best in Berkeley that I have tried. Large portions - small to medium eaters can easily share. Good small selection of beers< /text>

<date>1578896288746</date><Rate>5</Rate><text>Prepare to drop $25 for a half pound burger and onion rings, $7 for a milkshake. If you can get past that, prepare for some truly amazing food! This time I  had a Caribbean burger, filled with grilled jerk rubbed veggies, and a well done (my choice) flame grilled patty. The basket of huge, perfectly cooked onion rings topped with melted parmesan cheese would have been  enough without the burger.  Still, looked forward to having half the burger for dinner. This is not a place to go all the time, but you owe it to yourself to see how well a burger can be made.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>This is my go-to place whenever we have people visiting Berkeley and want to get a large group together to eat. They always seem to have just enough space to fit our group, ranging anywhere from 4-10.

They have a great selection of burgers, all of them great. My personal favorites are Maui Waui, Baja, and Hickory.

The fries are delicious and come in huge portions. We usually get a full size serving of fries to split. The only fries I wouldn't recommend are the truffle fries. You can smell the truffle oil, but it doesn't really impact the taste, especially if you're going to be dipping them in ketchup.

Really generous portions. Expect to be stuffed by the time you're through with your burger and fries. If you get a shake in on top of that...well, good luck. I still feel full by the time I should be eating my next meal.<//Review>< date>

We got to the restaurant and it's pretty amazing! There is a great patio area and in the restaurant is cozy with wood furniture and a fireplace. There isn't a lot of street parking in this area but there is a Safeway right across the street.

The servers were really attentive to our needs and were really quick at taking our order. Food came out super quick. We ordered curly fries, the Big Barney, and the Voodoo Burger. The fries were on our table in less than 10 minutes and the our burgers were there in another 10 minutes. The fries were super fresh and hot. The ranch they have for it seems homemade and pairs well with the fries. Our burgers were hot and juicy. I would have liked my bun to be toasted and the pattie to be more heavily seasoned but it was still an excellent burger and nothing a salt shaker and pepper grinder could not fix (they were already there on the table along with ketchup, mustard, Dijon, and Tabasco).

Overall we had an excellent experience and I'm sure we'll be back soon.< /Review>

They catered to us being vegetarian/vegan. They have those option for any burger style. You'd have to reserve a table if possible specially if its a big party as they get full pretty quick. Fries were cooked perfect. Very friendly owner and works with his employees well.<//text>

But one serious issue would be that they use plastic packaging for hamburgers to go. The problem is, when you arrive at home and wanna take a bite of it, the bottom side of the burger is already soaked by some humidity and heat from ingredients of the menu, which is gross.The packaging issue nearly got me lower the rating to 3 stars. Honestly, I would like to give 3.5 stars. Also, I would like yo add that if superduper burger was nearby my place, I would not have even tried here... Anyway so far I just tried one menu so let me try some other menus and update this review.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOYQ83kYrLCYr25QWyMJS-DLry4aw3MsLPWq2h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80857ea10eb777ab:0xabdec8f3a0b2a828</gmap_id></record>

I've eaten at Barney's on a occasion while working in Berkeley and about once a year since retirement. They have always served an excellent burger. (Pricey, too.) Today's lunch was not their best.

I ordered my burger medium. What I received was well-done. Dry and crumbly and very chewy around the edges. Not suitable for a $15 burger. It was bacon-chedder on a gluten free bun.

Service was excellent. Kept this from being a 1-star review.<//Review>

Either way, it's the best place to get a burger in Berkeley. There's a large number of options to build a burger from. Multiple buns, meats, etc. The fries aren't anything special but still go well with the burgers. Always a good option for food, but just check your food before leaving to make sure it's all correct.< /Text>< user_id>

<Review>The veggie burger was better than I remembered 10 years ago! We ordered ahead. Phone service was prompt and courteous. Burger was ready for pick up at appointed time. Overall, a great take out experience, although a little pricey. Two vegan burgers and fries were around $28.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Good spot for a big burger and lots of different sides, and sports viewing. Service was pretty good, the bathroom was kind of weird, but that's besides the point. One thing, I would suggest putting lettuce on the lower bun when someone orders a burger medium well, my bun was soaked through before I picked it up.</Text>

Reliable standard fare. A key East Bay joint with consistently great food. Hamburgers are always delicious, steak fries are a must. The salads are generous and tasty. Don’t miss the milkshakes! Our family has been going the Barney’s for two decades. It’s great for families and folks of all ages.<//Text>

<Review>IMHO, I expected a better experience.  Parking was challenging.  Lots of burger choices and mine was tasty enough but the presentation could have been better.  Expect a messy and expensive burger. 13.95 plus tax and tip...<//Review><Name>Lance Buckley</Name>< Pictures>

Now I know why everytime I go on about a giant hamburger someone asks me if I've been to Barney's — these are burgers of epic proportions! I had the Morrocan burger, which was spicy, and topped with provolone and 1000 Island dressing (my prime condiment weakness). Barney's gets extra points for having gluten-free buns, and knowing which of their many fry options are *actually* gluten-free. Grass-fed beef, turkey, salmon, and garden (also Beyond) burgers make it possible to kick back for burger time with anyone that isn't a Breatherarian. The salads look equally as amazing, but I never made it that far and I had enough lettuce on my burger to satisfy the customary vegetable requirement.< /review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>This was one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. I got the Gastropub Burger, a 1/2 lb of Certified Angus Beef cooked medium, served on a pretzel bun and topped with provolone, bacon (perfectly cooked and flavored), a fried egg, and blackened potato chips. It was as red, juicy, and flavorful as you could wish. The steak fries were the Platonic ideal of steak fries. The chocolate milkshake (served with a spoon and with the extra in a blender cup, like it should be) was thick and rich. The atmosphere - wood tables and beams, with a roaring fire - was warm and comfortable, and the staff were smiling and hospitable. This place is exactly what a gourmet burger restaurant should be.<//review>< Pictures>

Middle of the pack in terms of burgers in Berkeley even though it's been around for decades. Too many choices. Though their milkshakes are awesome. Though I'm not complaining their portion sizes are gargantuan. No wonder there's an obesity epidemic in America. Too much red meat and carbs.< /Review>

Great old-timer Berkeley favorite for lunch. It may also be good for dinner but I have only done lunches here. The name says 'burger' but it is much more. Awesome healthy salads, hearty soups, wooden rustic space with high ceiling, warm and cozy ambiance, and great service. I'm part of a Thu group lunch here and look forward to it.< /Review>

Love the variety here. Sometimes burgers can be a little undercooked (despite asking for well-done), but not terribly so. If you order in, there are sometimes mix-ups but they have a huge volume most of the time, so I can forgive that.

The burgers themselves are really good and large. My favorite is the french burger - baguette bun w/ blue cheese. Curly fries are awesome.<//Review>

If I'm completely candid I miss some of the back in da day stuff,  before they consolidated the menu.  There used to be a greater variety of burger types (2 vegan options instead of one, more meat/fowl ones as well).
However,  our server was exceptionally nice.  I would be sad if I returned and she wasn't available . She was so patient with our party,  offered suggestions,  went beyond the basics to ensure a satisfying meal.  The portions are still generous,  the prices reasonable, the seating at the location accessible,  armless chairs (varies not true for all their venues).
Everything was good.  If you want a burger with lots of choices for individualizing the condiments,  sauces,  embellishments - erm I mean toppings,  this is the place.  You'll leave super full!</Text>

Burgers done right.  Not fast food, not pretentiously "foodie", and not like diner food.   Just high quality beef, flame - broiled to order, with all the trimmings you could want available on the side.   The fries and salads are generously portioned and delicious as well.  A good selection of beers to complement the meal.   And because this is Berkeley,  there is organic Kombucha on tap.<//Text>

Came down to visit from Boston.  Was wondering what was a top burger place here in the bay area, and I must say the burger I got from here was absolutely delicious. Service was excellent and quick and enjoyed the environment in the restaurant. I definitely recommend this place for the burger lovers.<//Text>

My grandchildren took me for my birthday. The spinach salad is just as fresh and delicious as years ago, when it was my favorite choice for lunch after jogging around lake Merritt. I was presented with a surprise sundae with a candle, compliments of the restaurant ( my grandkids did not request it, so one of the servers is very observant), after the meal. Highly recommend! thanks!<//Text>

<text>Great burgers. Baja is my favorite. Always crispy bacon, lots of avocado and cooled the way you ask for it. You can substitute any kind of meat on a burger or go vegetarian. Sweet potato fries are great. Service is sometimes a little slow but it's usually because they are busy.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Best onion rings and fries ever. I would come back to this place just for their onion rings. The rings come in the size of your fist, full of flavors and requires couple bites to consume these goodies. The hamburgers are not bad, but onion rings and fries are the must haves.

I had a celebration here for a party of 50 one time. Barney's has a banquet hall in the back of the restaurant and it is the perfect place to have a big gathering. The hosts were super helpful and accommodating. They even allowed us to use their TVs to play our own slideshows.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80857ea10eb777ab:0xabdec8f3a0b2a828</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Quickie:
+ Lived in North Berkeley for 3 years during college and only one block away from the Gourmet Ghetto - so to say I frequented Barney's is an understatement.
+ Friggin' amazing burgers

---

Food:
What can I say? The burgers are delicious as are their fries (both steak cut and sweet potato). It's hard to narrow down but I think the French burger is my favorite (Crumbled Bleu cheese and bacon, yum). But in the number of times I've been there, I've probably tried over half the menu and my friends accounted for the rest. Always spectacular, very different combinations - just an all-around nice burger joint.

Overall:
They do take-out. as well, so if you have a midterm to cram for back at home, just call in and pick up in 15. All in all, Barney's is a great alternative to a greasy fast food burger - they do gourmet on a broke college kid's budget.< /review>< Gmap_id>

<review>Spent 20 dollars on a burger and fries and hot water bottle..  Got home and was sick to my stomach.  Went to the ER and for sure it was food poisoning symptoms.  This was not a great experience for me and it's horrible as I speak now. Over priced and I am paying for it in pain at this hospital.. Don't eat here.  OMG 😱< /review>< pics>

Awesome (Niman Ranch) burgers in a wide variety of styles from chipotle/mushroom to bacon/cheddar to spinach/feta to Louisiana blackened with grilled veggies -- just a few of their ~30 specialty burgers --  and I've yet to have a bad one. Plus their Turkish coffee shakes, chocolate malts and sweet potato fries are equally great complements.< /review>

<review>They have an extensive selection of burgers to choose from with a good selection of patty options: beef, chicken, turkey and portabello mushroom, to name a few.  Their seasoned curly fries and ranch dip keep calling us back!  And their Oreo shakes are a wonderful sweet indulgence.</review>< UserId.>

<Review>Great location to stop by and grab something to eat, the menu had a large variety of options to choose from and staff were welcoming and  friendly.

The food was also great and can definitely confirm it was fantastically gourmet.<//Review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) I would describe Barney's as a casual or informal place where you can eat a delicious burger plus good fries and a rich draft beer, and enjoy its good, laid-back atmosphere and reasonable service.
