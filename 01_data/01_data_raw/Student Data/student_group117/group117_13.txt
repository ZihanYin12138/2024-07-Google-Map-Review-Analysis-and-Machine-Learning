Excellent service. Daniel came out and did my verification for me. He was friendly and quick. Literally took 15 minutes. Their service saves you massively on time and that alone justifies the already reasonable price.</Text>

Great experience. Joy verified my 29ft travel trailer and since I had already started the process out of state, she even looked over the docs I had already filled out to check for accuracy. I'm already holding my registration in hand and my title is on the way. Thank you Joy!< /Review>

Only way to get a VIN Verification done!  They were able to drop by my office, inspect the vehicle, leave the paperwork and all within 48 hours of me reaching out and while I was actually away from work. Why deal with the bureaucracy when you can get such great customer service from the private sector? Would highly recommend.<//text>

Joy was such a joy!! I called her after seeing her glowing yelp reviews and she was at my house within two hours! I had already wasted an hour at a tag shop trying to register my little travel trailer and was not looking forward to going to the DMV like the tag shop said I had to. Joy came out so quickly, processed everything within 20 minutes and was kind, professional, helpful and efficient! I will never go to the DMV again, it is well worth the money to have Joy come next time we need anything!</review>

I made the call Friday and Monday Joy came out to verify the vin # on our recently purchased travel trailer.  The paperwork was somewhat confusing for me but Joy was very knowledgeable and completed all forms in just minutes. I Took all forms to AAA for processing and everything was detailed and correct. Thank you to Joy and Elite mobile verification.

I was worried about transferring my car registration from another state especially because I moved in during COVID-19. But these guys came to my rescue and got everything done for me. I spent less than 30 minutes for paperwork, car check and received my registration in a week in my mailbox. They meet you at your place of convenience and are extremely easy to work with. Highly recommended!< /Review>

Worth the money! This was the most convenient service I could have asked for. We had a trip planned in a few days and couldn't get our new trailer to the DMV for vin verification before hand. Elite Mobile offered to come in two days, which I was thrilled about, but then  called back and was available in an hour. The representative was knowledgeable and quick. It was the easiest DMV experience I've ever had. If it wasn't for this company we wouldn't have been able to register our trailer before out trip. Despite the convenience fee, I would highly recommended.</Review>

I received a letter from our wonderful department of motor vehicles. I thought I had more time to have my vehicle VIN verified. But the DMV had other ideas. I called Elite Mobile Auto Registration. Joy said she was available that afternoon. when we met at our arranged time I showed her all the paperwork I had on my vehicle. Joy verified all the pertinent informational for the DMV and completed the necessary paperwork. The whole process was painless and quick. Next time I need some off-site DMV paperwork completed I will definitely be giving Elite Mobile Auto Registration a call.< /text>

Was very easy to make an appointment. Dan was punctual and extremely knowledgeable about what I needed to do in my situation. Informed me of my options and proceeded get to work on my vin inspection and corresponding paperwork. He was timely and was in and out in under 40 minutes. This is an exceptional service seeing that any normal person would have to wait MANY HOURS to have completed at the DMV.</text>

I don’t often leave reviews, but Joy and Elite Mobile absolutely deserve the 5 stars!  Joy was able to navigate the insanity of the DMV for my ambulance to RV conversion by handling registration, VIN verification, and all documents needed to register the vehicle.  She showed up the same day I called and did it all for an extremely reasonable fee!</Text>

I had to use a VIN Verification service for our new RV and didn’t want to hassle connecting to the truck and navigating down to the DMV where I would wait for hours. Elite Mobile came to the house and gave me all the paperwork I needed to get my registration complete. Great job!< /review>

Joy is the best.  Showed up at my home 20 minutes after I called.  Completed VIN inspection forms for both California and Oregon.  Very professional and very reasonable.  Respected social distance and wore face mask.  I felt very safe.

I was so happy to find an easier way to do my vin verification instead of the DMV. Dan was super professional, nice and fast! I called at 10am and he already had time to meet me at 1.30 at a place close to my house. Definitely 5 stars.</Review>

DMV was not taking any new appointments. Then I found Joy. I needed a VIN verification. Then Joy told me she could handle the registration for me. Amazing!!!!  She was able to meet me right away. She knew exactly what was needed and the entire process was seamless and painless. I can’t express how happy I am with Joy.  I highly recommend Elite.  10 stars if I could give them.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Joy was amazing to work with. She even helped accommodate a tricky schedule on my end and showed up locally to help knock out my Vin verification. I highly recommend her service, well over going to the DMV or any other than verification service. Joy cares about getting it right the first time for her customers.<//review>

< review>
I've been trying to get a CA DMV appointment to register my out of state vehicle for months. With no appointments available throughout the year due to Covid and the out of state tags expiring within 10 days, I turned to Elite Vehicle. Joy was extremely accommodating and dropped by my office parking lot to help verify and start the paperwork for registering my car. She even wrote me a permit in case anyone stops my car once my out of state tags expire. You just have to make sure you have the smog check done ahead of time, have your title and out of state registration with you and Joy will help with the rest. I will definitely refer all my friends to Joy and Elite Vehicle for this amazingly convenient service. Thanks Joy!</review>

So I was in the process of registering my 2016 jeep renegade from Colorado to California since September and all online because I don't have the time to stand in the long DMV line! After a long drawn out process online Im finally able to mail in the required documents to get my updated registration. All I needed now was a California  licensed vehicle verifier. Drove by the DMV and saw the the long line wrapped twice around the building and said "nope!... ain't nobody got time for that". Googled California licensed vehicle verifier and came across Elite Mobile! My experience  was above and beyond amazing especially when you have an outstanding person helping you out such as Joy whose knowledge and expertise was just unmatched!!! Meeting her was very convenient in which she would give you an address close to where you live! Having worked for the DMV herself she new all the ins and out of the documents and even took the time to help me understand and fill out the forms correctly! Come to find out I could of done everything with them and they would've have filed everything for me!!! The only regrets I have is that I didn't find them sooner! Thank you so much Joy for your phenomenal help; you have gone above and beyond my expectations!!! I will definitely recommend this to friends and will be going through you for future DMV requests!!!</text>

<Text>Joy is wonderful and we can’t recommend her services enough! We have 2 young kids at home due to COVID and therefore it’s almost impossible to get to the DMV. She came to our house, helped us complete our CA registration, was beyond respectful of COVID safety measures, and made the process so stress free for us. Forever grateful and highly recommend. And she’s stayed just as responsive and helpful even after the appointment while we wait for things in the mail. Thank you again so much Joy!!<//Text><resp>{'time': 1601583817840, 'text': 'Jeffrey  you are so  awesome  ! I really  appreciate  your review  . So nice working with you on your DMV process  .

Joy offers true concierge service!  Purchased a travel trailer out of state and Joy met with us at the storage facility to verify VIN and other details and then hand-walked the registration and ownership transfer at the DMV.  Was on time and very thorough in all matters.  Highly recommend.</Review>

<Review>In short....I contacted 5 company’s to get a quote on verifying my out is state car. One texted me back and said $200 because they had to drive from riverside. Three didn’t return my email. This company Elite not only contacted me right away, but rushed right over and verified my car vin in seconds for more then half of what the other company wanted to charge me. I would differently recommend this company.< /Review><Resp>{'time': 1594503439726, 'text': 'Just want 2 act , Thank you so much for this fantastic  review .\nYou Rock .'}<//Resp><Rating>5< /Rating>< gmap_id>

Joy was amazing!! This whole process could not have been any easier. She comes to your location and took care of the VIN check and all registration and title paperwork right there on the spot (just make sure you get your smog check done first!). She was very kind and helpful and the whole process took no more than 20 minutes. I would HIGHLY recommend her to anyone looking to register their car or transfer title that doesn't want to wait at the DMV.<//Review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><text>This company is great if you’re in need of a vehicle verification!! I was in need of one due to DMV recoding the incorrect mileage on the title (their error not mine) and to correct their issue DMV indicated a vehicle verification was required. I was happy to find Elite Mobile via a google search and saw the great reviews! From
The moment I spoke with Joy, she was friendly and was able to schedule the same day. I had a schedule conflict but was able to come the next day. Her husband Dan arrived earlier than expected and texted me ahead of time. He was extremely friendly and started confirming the information on my motorcycle and was fast and efficient. Dan definitely knew what he was doing and I was impressed with how seamless the entire process went. Once he was done he provided me with the completed Reg 31 (Verification of Vehicle) form required to submit to DMV to complete the title correction and registration. If you’re looking for a quality company to get vehicle verifications done, go with Elite Mobile. Prompt, efficient, friendly, professional and great price!! Thanks Dan and Joy!!!<//text><user>106188176282290183827< /user>< time>

Joy showed up the same day I needed help transferring an out of state vehicle to a California title. She did the vin verification and paperwork for me. Plates came in a week later! Can’t recommend enough!!</review>

Joy is THE BEST!! There are not enough words for me to thank her for all of her help in getting my husband’s out of state, out of date truck registered in California while he is deployed. The last thing I wanted to do is go sit at the DMV for hours on end while I’m 9 months pregnant and risk not having all of the correct paperwork. Joy knew exactly what we needed and took care of everything. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! THE BEST!!< /Text>

Joy was very professional and so helpful. She assisted me with a VIN verification and in 10 minutes we were done. I just wish I called her sooner, that way I wouldn’t still be dealing with the DMV.  Do yourself a favor, call Joy and skip the DMV....

**Update **
Thankfully the CA DMV returned all of my original documents. Joy was able to register and title my Tacoma that I bought and shipped to CA. She’s the best!!!< /review>

We would not hesitate to call her again in the future, and will recommend her services!<//text>< Pictures>

Very amazing experience from my first phone call and especially meeting Dan! He saved me $201! He noticed it was a family title transfer😁
I got my plates and cash back!
Thank you Elite and Dan!< /Review>

<Review>I purchased a 1958 chevy pickup out of State and have another truck 1957 chevy that I had for months without success to register. So when I was referred to Joy for assistance registering pickups, I didn't know her or did I think she could really help me. She was beyond professional and very courteous, I enjoy her company very much. She assured me no problems and true to her word, NOT one problem and it took less then a week. Her price was very fare, I thought it would cost ALOT more. I would like to say to anyone having any kind of problems registering a vehicle do yourself a favor and give Joy a chance, if your anything like me you'll find yourself thanking God for sending her. Thank you Joy KUDOS!!!</Review>< rate>

Joy came out to my home - she called and let me know she could come a bit early, and arrived right on schedule. She had the whole process done in about 10 minutes! It was fast and easy, and much better than sitting around at the DMV all day. I would definitely recommend them to anyone who needs a vin verification done.

<text>I made an appt  with Joy for 10am to do a couple of vin verifications.

At 9:30am she sent a text confirming my appt. She arrived promptly and proceeded to do exactly what I needed.  Absolutely painless and such a “Joy” to work with.

I highly recommend Joy for any of your DMV needs.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><username>Darryle Fernandez<//username>< Time>

We bought a classic car. I looked online to learn about DMV registration for older cars. Everyone said older cars are difficult to register at the DMV. The DMV does not always have someone on hand to go out to your car and verify the VIN number and the employees at the DMV often do not know how to correctly register your older vehicle (plus the lines are extremely long). I watched a video where a classic car collector swore he would never again not use a mobile vehicle VIN registration service. I had never heard of such a service. I did several searches looking for nearby registration services and reviews. I came upon Elite Mobile Vehicle Vin Verification & Registration. The 50 5-star reviews stood above all the others. The reviews said Joy was awesome so I gave her a call. She sounded nice on the phone and was able to come out the next day. Joy arrived on time and got right to business. She looked at the car and recorded the VIN number, then began to fill out paperwork. She has a great personality, is very professional, and has great communication skills. It took about a half hour. She took the correct paperwork to bring to the DMV and left me a temporary registration. About a week later, I received the license plates in the mail and the new registration papers. A couple of weeks later, we received the car title in the mail. Unless you enjoy dealing with the mayhem at the DMV, give Joy a call. It was well worth it.</Text>

I have an old car that I received from my father. Elite made the impossible possible. After 3 trips to the DMV with no success I gave them a call.  Joy came to my home, verified the car and filled out all the paperwork. A few days later I had my plates and registration.  I wish I would have called them from beginning. I would have paid twice as much to never go back to the DMV. Worth every penny!!<//review>

Saved me from taking a day off work to sit at the dmv for hours on end (only to get sent home for missing forms or paperwork, or some other BS Commiefornia red tape). All I had to do was call, they drove to me, did vin verification and did all the work for me and returned with my plates and registration. Thank God for these fine people. Worth every f***ng penny! Thank you!<//review>

<Review>Ole's alignment is my go to shop for suspension and brakes needs. Very reasonably priced and they will get the job done. They might be a little old school, but that's what is best about them. They get it right, old or new. They even straightened a utility trailer axle when I was told by several places it couldn't be done. Also, You can take your own parts and they will work with you. They are closed Friday and weekends but it's worth the time to schedule for mon- Thursday work. You can even drop car off night before, they will work with you :)</Review>< Rate>

< Review>
There's a way to tell if an auto shop is honest. Visit the dealer and take their list of services they say are necessary along with their pricing and tell the mechanic what the dealer said. If they agree with the dealer, you have a dishonest mechanic or the rare experience of a dealership not pushing unnecessary services. I did just that at this place and they talked me out of what I already knew were unnecessary services and gave me a great price on what I did need.</Review>

<UserId.>101819080374916167020< /UserId.><name>Tom<//name><date>1482552353781</date><rating>5</rating><text>On a trip to Houston from SF.  Thursday I thought something was wrong with my brakes because of a new noise.  Just happened to be in Yucca taking the scenic route.  Saw Ole's and pulled in.  He checked my brakes, found nothing, but found a screw in my tire and that there was some play in the wheel.  Told me it was the bearings going bad.  Advised me to buy the part and get it fixed before traveling more.  Ole did not charge me anything for the brake check and he didn't tell me I needed new brakes when I didn't. He suggested another tire shop to remove the screw and patch the tire.  See AA Tire & Muffler.  See my review.  They told me the same thing about the bearings.  It was too late to get work done, but I bought the part. Checked with another place at 7:00 the next morning.  Told me it would be around 1:00 and cost me $240 for labor because of rust on the undercarriage. Came back to Ole's at 8:00.  He fixed it in under an hour and charged me $60.  This got us back on the road to Houston without too much lost time.  If we had waited until Monday, we would have needed to turn around and head back to SF.  I would use Ole's anytime I could if I was in the area.  May have him do some more work when we go back through the area.  Thanks Ole.</text>< Pics>

Very knowledgeable mechanics, old school like me. They showed me the exact problem why they couldn't continue with an alignment. A brand new rod end bought at AutoZone was seriously bad. They suggested buying only MOOG front end  products and after ordering one online and comparing, I will now buy nothing else but them. Took the van back and they did an alignment to my satisfaction.< /text>

<text>Ole's changed my brake pads last week and performed the work fast-No muss, no fuss! I had called several other spots in the area who quoted me twice the cost and said the work would take 2-4 hours. The fellas had me in and out in a half hour at 3:30 on a Friday afternoon. I will be back for my next servicing.</text><Rate>5</Rate>< Gmap_id>

<review>I had such a comforting experience with Oakwood Legal Group. After my accident, they made me feel rest assured they were going to take care of everything from doctor’s appointments to any of the questions I had regarding my vehicle and my case. They were quick to respond through email or phone calls. I would definitely go through them again. Thank you!</review>< Resp>

<Review>At first I was treated amazing and told I had a case but after a year and a half I was told since I wasn’t seriously injured or dead they couldn’t represent me to make sure I was taken care of. I wasn’t even told I was dropped as a client until I emailed Rebecca and she claimed they didn’t have a updated phone number for me, which I had updated 3 different times but they didn’t update the system. She was able to email me time and time again for record release forms to be signed and pictures of my drivers license but couldn’t email me to drop me as a client till I contacted them. Very disappointed and won’t be contacting them in the future, as well as getting a second opinion on my case.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user_name>

This is a firm you can trust. I’ve seen they genuinely care about helping their clients and it’s really refreshing. They are extremely helpful and will answer all of your questions in a really professional manner. You will feel safe when you see their winning track record. Such a capable group of people. Highly recommended!< /review>

Oakwood Legal was professional, efficient and responsive to all of my needs when it came to my car accident that involved me and my child. It was a relief to have them by my side through this extremely difficult time, and they had everything taken care of in an efficient and timely matter, as well as having great customer service. I am so thankful and would definitely recommend them to my friends and family.</review>

<text>The lawyers over at Oakwood Legal are one of the most professional people I have ever encountered. They are highly knowledgeable, experienced and they are truly experts you can trust. My experiences working with them are nothing but positive. They are responsive, honest and they make you feel comfortable. I truly felt like I was in good hands and taken care of. You will hardly find better personal injury lawyers in our area.< /text>< Pics>

Their services are always personalized and they adapt to each case. They provide top-notch services and go out of their way to help you. I am notified each step of the way and there is not a single thing during the whole process that I am not informed about. They truly care and it shows in their work and the way they approach each case. I highly recommend them! You won’t regret it.<//Review>

Good communication no sugar coating there direct and straight to the point. Sometimes it takes a bit longer than I want for certain things to get done but there is no lack of them communicating that it will take longer than expected I recommend them if your in need for a good injury lawyer< /Text>

I can’t say enough positive things about the lawyers and staff who work at Oakwood Legal Group. For over three years they were with me every step of the way. Their professionalism and work ethics is what sets them apart from others. Great team!</Text>

The whole legal team at Oakwood handled everything for us. The process went smoothly and we felt that we were in very capable hands. We never had any worries and they constantly updated us throughout the case. Every person we talked with in the firm was courteous and knowledgeable. This was the first time that I needed the services of a lawyer and I am very happy I chose them. Thank you for all your help!< /Text>

I took this firm after reading so many good reviews. I had an accident August last year and until today, I only got fraction of the settlement that I am supposed to get. I have contacted them many times in regards of my outstanding cheque, always told they'll ring back, they never did. This firm just simply ignoring me when I am due the rest of the money. I could go on and on. But if you are still reading - Do not use this company.<//review>

They are an honest and trustworthy firm who genuinely cares for their clients. Super helpful and informative, they answered all my questions in a kind and professional manner. Highly capable too! Winning track record - nothing like having these extremely capable legal teams when you are dealing with big insurance companies.<//text>

<Review>My case is still ongoing, and they have kept the lines of communication open through the whole process. They have been constantly informing me about the latest updates and has been invited to their office to speak to me personally. Such a nice experience of having people who makes you feel they are working hard on your case. I would definitely recommended their services to anyone looking for the best personal injury lawyers.< /Review>< pics>

Got hit by a car while I was crossing the street.  Good thing a well-meaning friend recommended OLG.  They have the most attentive staff I have ever encountered. Their brilliant legal team won my case for me.  Got to recoup my medical expenses as well as income loss.  The settlement also covered my legal expenses so I didn’t have to pay them anything from my pocket. Such compassionate people. Thank you!<//text>

They expertly handled my personal injury claim. I was confident that they could deliver on their promise and they did not disappoint. They constantly informed me of any developments, and they showed that they were concerned about the outcome of the case. I cannot thank them enough for helping me during these difficult times.< /review>

So, whatever your problem is, don't be nervous and just go ahead with this group.

Plus, they will always keep you updated on the developments in your case. So, go ahead already!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

They always answered my phone calls whenever I had questions or concerns.  They offered me the best customer service, I am very happy to have had them as attorneys to fight for my two auto accident cases.  Thank you very much Oakwood Legal Group you did an excellent job.  I absolutely recommend it.

< Review>
I’m really thankful for this office and what they do. Being a victim of a life changing event makes you a different person and I don’t trust others so it was hard to even hire a firm. I didn’t ever imagine a law office having such a huge impact on my case and on my pursuit of justice and closure. The outcome far exceeded what I thought and even exceeded what other law firms had told me to expect. I highly recommend this office, their attorney talents are really unique and they outsmarted my defendant lawyers every step of the way. It was a long long process but I couldn’t be happier, and more appreciative.</Review>

Had a great experience with Oakwood Legal Group. They were hands on since day one and they always update me about the case until we settled 3 years later.

<text>Wonderful people, from the lawyers down to all their staff. The best thing about the lawyers here is that they are very honest about their services and what they can do. They don’t promise you the stars and the moon to get your business. It’s no surprise that they came highly recommended from a close friend of mine. They are truly the best!</text><Resp>None<//Resp><Time>1602641685565< /Time>< rating>

Just wish I could give the people in this wonderful firm more that 5 stars. They have been with through every step of my journey until the final settlement. Hard to fight corporate America without the help of this amazing people! Got more than what I initially wanted and more. Thank you very much!<//text>

<text>It was a very traumatic situation for me and I didn’t even have any idea how to deal with that. Meeting the lawyers at Oakwood Legal Group gave me the confidence that I am in safe hands. They weren’t only competent but very friendly too. Helped me with their professional expertise and thanks to their legal assistance, I received justice and closure. I cannot thank them enough for the help they have been to me! Thank you, guys!</text><Rating>5<//Rating><date>1606445491256<//date><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user>100649670094571320556</user>< user_name>

Best firm! I had another lawyer first and they wanted me to take 50,000. Which wasn’t bad. I called OLG and once they took over things totally changed. I got a $250,000 settlement. I am forever grateful!!< /Review>

The attorneys at Oakwood Legal Group are true professionals who know what they're doing and how to fight for their clients' cases. I am amazed at their level of care and support during one of the most stressful times of my life. They don't just get the result done, they also make you feel safe and secure, like there's a big guy on your side and everything will be ok. I am very pleased with their services and highly recommend them to everyone I know.<//Review>

<Text>It took over a year for my case to finish, I now have tons of back and neck pain from the accident and they hardly gave me any money for my case. Very disappointed and I won’t refer this legal group to anyone or if I need a lawyer, I will not be using them again.  Sad, I now have permanent issues and didn’t get but a dime.   Wish I would of went with someone else. Angry.< /Text><date>1611964630668<//date><userid>103449279649882243397< /userid>< response>

<Review>Met a terrible car accident and I couldn’t have gotten a more caring group to represent me than OLG.  Since I was initially immobile, they were the ones who came to see me at my home to prepare for my case.  In the end, I was able to recover my medical expenses and more – thanks to the big settlement they were able to procure for me.  Thank you so much, OLG!  I will be forever grateful to you guys.</Review>< time>

I was able to get quick responses on my case questions. The staff is very educational and always treated me like I was their #1 client. I’ve had situations in the past where the firm I was dealing with, at the time, hadn’t prioritized my case. It was relieving to know Oakwood wanted me to win as much as I wanted to win. Definitely recommend.<//text>

<review>My name is Martin and I’m pleased to finally say it’s over! They tell you that for serious accidents it’s a long and tough process and it is. It’s hard to stay patient when you’re going through hell but they do a nice job of answering your questions and making sure you’re good. The case went extremely well, all my bills were paid and I got more than I ever imagined as my take home amount. Great lawyers and legal team, I’d definitely recommend them.<//review></record></dataset><record>

My experience was incredible. My attorney went above and beyond the call of duty, checking on me multiple times throughout my case to see how I was. I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome and my future is now secure so I don’t need to worry about my treatment that I may need for my severely injured neck. They did great!< /text>

<Text>Me and my daughter were visiting CA from Boston when we got hit from behind in the middle of the day. Our vacation went from perfect, to disastrous in one minute. I didn’t where to start, who to call or what to do. My daughter found the OLG team and we couldn’t be happier with their level of care and service. Everything was handled beautifully. Highly recommended. They’re support staff is great and they have really smart lawyers with incredible backgrounds and knowledge too.< /Text>< pictures>

Wish I could give them an extra star. Eli and Michael are Sensational. You wont find another law firm that will actually get things accomplished like these highly trained individuals who know the letter of the law. I recommend that anyone that is in need of Integrity Filled Lawyers to be sure to give this Law Firm a call. Tell them that their client WILLIAM YAKEL sent you.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>They're the most unprofessional human being that I've eve encountered with. They told me that they were going to take my case, and asked for all my legal files and documents that are relevant to my case but few weeks after, they decided not to take my case anymore without due notice to me.  They just dropped me and left me hanging like that.  They just informed me thru text which was very unprofessional and unacceptable.

Decent overall experience, I only wished had the right coverage so that they could get me more. I know that they had my best interests in mind and if there was any way to get more they would have. There lawyers are super aggressive but super friendly at the same time, and they have unparalleled experience and education from my research. they attained the maximum available for me and I really felt taken care of. Again, i just wish i had better coverage but I would say you can't go wrong with this company</text>

Couldn’t find a better group of professionals to represent me. It was a long and arduous process but they were behind me every step of the way. They also informed me of everything that was going on and what the next steps would be. Finally got a settlement offer for my personal injuries which was close to what I wanted.

Worst lawfirm nothing was fulfilled as promised. Was told multiple times they would have no problems with getting me 6 figures but got me 65,000 after they took their money and paid doctors fees I was left with less than 1,000. My advice to anyone seeking there service is represent yourself.< /Text>

I was at my friend’s house helping with some housework when her dog knocked me off the ladder and I landed in a really awkward fashion shattering my knee cap. Naturally my friend wanted to help and handed over her insurance info and even called them to tell them that I deserve to be taken care of. I needed surgery missed months and months of work and I’ll never be the same again. Her insurance company at first acted professionally and made it seem like I’d be helped. They ended up offering to pay just for my bills!!! I found OLG online and after thoroughly answering all my questions I decided to hire them. And as they suspected I ended up with a settlement that paid my bills, paid my attorney fees, paid my lost wages, and I had 6 figures in my pocket after all that! They know the law, they know how to add a ton of value to the settlement as they’ll tell you, they won’t even advise you to hire them unless they’re confident they’ll put you in a better place as a result of their involvement. They’re just good people all around and I’m so thankful to end my year like this.< /Review>

Mckoy was the first person to reach out to me, on a weekend and provide me with a consultation. I appreciate the time taken to explain how things work and how he informed me of the process. Ultimately I hired this firm and worked with 2 attorneys and support staff. I felt they were professional and caring. All around good company.</Review>

<Text>I've had experience with law firms, although not for an injury case. In my experience my lawyers were hard to get a hold of and weren't always on top of the laws and how they apply to the facts of my case. My experience with OLG was completely different. My case manager and attorney constantly were in communication with me, even texting me which I thought was really cool. They gave me sound advice on weighed my options for me from start to finish. I got an incredible outcome and I'm thankful for all they did.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I mainly worked and talked with Eli who was very knowledgeable of my case and answered all of my calls and eagerly answered all of my questions. OLG gave me an overall good experience. In my pocket, I received far more than I ever expected from my accident. I know they worked hard to get what they did get for me. Thank you for all of your hard work and for helping me find justice in a situation that impacted me so significantly. I appreciate it!
And if you're looking for help in a situation that impacted you, I highly recommend OLG.</review>< response>

I called numerous times to find out what’s going on with my case and from the receptionist to my case manager and the attorneys, I always got my questions answered. The process was a long one but I couldn’t be happier with how they handled it! I got a mind blowing settlement that took care of all my bills and left me with a nice amount for my future.<//Text>

Wrost firm eve !!!! Stay away from them all they do is take your settlement. The process was so unprofessional. Settlement was $7,300 . I received $600. What do you call that . Scammers . My advice your better off handling it yourself.<//text>

I don’t know where to start. I had a life changing accident when we were hit by a drunk driver. The person who hit us had a $100,000 limit. I spoke to many firms before choosing who to hire. Attorney Mike Terani and his staff told me before accepting anything they would look at all legal options and while they can’t make guarantees, they will do all they can to get creative and think smart as lawyers. After less than one year they got me, my boyfriend and our friend over $2,000,000. I’m completely and utterly shocked. When they tell you not all lawyers are created equal, they prove it. Unbelievable. I’m so incredibly thank to you all.</Text>

I had the opportunity to join forces with this law firm, I was in a serious accident in June of 2018 it is now December and i had my surgery done and the paperwork has been filed. I have no other words to describe the professionalism and dedication this team has given my case. I’m truly grateful for this law firm.< /Text>

I got hit by a car as a pedestrian and didn’t know what to do! The car left the scene of the accident and many firms told me they couldn’t help despite how badly I was hurt and how my life was flipped upside down. I seriously lost all hope in any chance of getting justice until my friend told me about OLG. I contact Mckoy and he was incredible. They handled my case swiftly and I was left with a great outcome!< /review>

I thank god every day that I chose to hire Oakwood Legal Group as my counsel . The accicent I was involved in made me extremely deppresssd , but one of the few things I would look forward to is the case I had with Oakwood Legal Group. I got the attention I deserved from them , they really know how to make their clients feel special. I got a very promising settlement at the end of my case witch-allowed me to get back on my feet again. Thank you Oakwood Legal Group for all the positive support.< /Review>

I first contacted Mike and his team when my son got hit by a car. It was a really stressful situation for my wife and I and We’re lucky to have chosen them. They were extremely responsive and professional and helped with everything from a-z.<//Text>

From the day I fell at the mall and fractured my leg on two places until the day this case was over was a hell of a journey that I don’t wish on anyone, these guys did so much for me from answer my question to setting me up with drivers to my appointments to meeting me and prepping me for my depositions with the other lawyers to even coming and seeing me in the hospital after my second surgery, I thank them from bottom of my heart< /Review>

A truly great decision to move forward with Mckoy, Matt and the lawyers at OLG. At first I called them just for case value and thought I would be able to handle things on my own. I thought that I just had whiplash and soreness but the pain wouldn't subside and I ended up having serious issue in spine including bulges and nerve pain. If it wasn't for OLG I would never be able to get the medical treatment I needed to get my life back on track. They were there every step of the way, helped with everything and when the case settled I walked away with much more than I ever imagined. They know the law and how to use it to get you much more than any other law firms out there. I spoke to at least 5 firms and OLG was by far the most direct and on point with their evaluation of my case. Awesome firm.<//Text>

Today was my 1st time here. I drive by every day on my way home from work. I finally decided to stop and was glad I did! This place is clean, friendly service from Lily Jane and delicious pizza at a good price. I'll be back!<//text>

I love the pizza but they actually close at 8pm.  Not 9pm as what google sAys. This made me upset as I have a family function and wanted pizza plus because it posted 9pm.  They need to update this ASAP To not disappoint anymore customers.  BYW I called T 8:11pm to only heat thru were closed :(<//review>

<text>Great place to get pizza. I love coming here. It gives you that hometown feel. We’ve had many birthday parties here and they turned out great. The service is also great. The prices are pretty good and the options are really good. I definitely recommend coming here whenever you drive through Linden.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Great place, with great food!  They have a salad bar, arcades, and a soda fountain.  The food is always good, and they have rapid service.  High quality toppings for the pizza, and the crust is absolute perfection.  Never disappointed in visiting this place!  I drive 40 minutes to eat here, and there are several big box pizza companies inbetween, but prefer this spot.  Try them out!< /review>

<review>Good selection you just have to dig and find. Best time to go is in the am. I went around around 10:30 and like 3 people were in the store not including the employees. I found some good brands and non branded quality stuff. This place is your classic thrift. They aren't going to put together a get up for you but they def have the stuff to make a poppin fit. I'd say intermediate thirfter level.< /review>< Rating>

From the employees making you feel welcomed, to the very lower prices than other stores. The range of items they put on the shelves is endless. They’ve done an impressive job maintaining us the public during this pandemic crisis. Thanks Goodwill Bp!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Today at Goodwill it's green tag special day.  Yep green tagged items are only $1. How great is that! On our way out  we were told "green tag special " will last through Saturday. With such nice items and prices its a no brainer to donate a $1. Helps people with disabilities get job training.  Now thats GOODWILL!!!</Text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>If I could give more than 5 stars I would !!!  This is one of the best Goodwills in the country and it is NEVER PICKED THROUGH !!!  It's insane how there is constantly fresh merchandise coming through here - if you come to the Baldwin Park store at 10 in the morning and look at everything, then you come back at 7 pm that same day, it's like the store grew amazing new designer dresses and brand new power tools right out of the impeccably clean tiled floors !!!  Baldwin Park is a town back on the rise located just slightly west of West Covina and the energy of the staff is so positive even if you didn't buy anything (which is virtually IMPOSSIBLE given that the selection of merchandise is unreal), there is no way you could leave the store without feeling like you are walking on air and in touch with all that is good with the Earth and mankind.  I am a diehard thrift store junkie and have been to every Goodwill in California from Chula Vista all the way north to Weed and after only being open not even three months yet, the Baldwin Park Goodwill is easily in the top five !!!  Once word gets out I bet even Alec Baldwin himself will be coming to the Baldwin Park Goodwill to shop and save with all of the amazing merchandise found exclusively at this location !!!!!!!< /text>< userid>

< Review>
Had an unbelievably pleasant experience at this location and was extremely impressed with the receptionist Christy who had helped me with the paperwork. She was very professional and immensely knowledgeable about the whole process. This was not my first time in this situation(unfortunately) and Christy gave me confidence in returning to this location again if I ever do find myself in this awful predicament. Thanks a mil, Christy!< /Review>

My experience at Alladdin was a light in the dark event that brought me to call a bail bonds. Amanda was so fast and efficient in helping me post bail and get out of the hell hole i was in. She helped me understand some of the legal jargon  that i clearly didn't understand. Thank you again Amanda. Keep up the good work.<//text>

<review>Christy and Amanda were so friendly and nice! It was uncomfortable for me to call a bail bond company but they made me feel MUCH better as they led me thru the process. Extremely professional, a very reputable company. I would HIGHLY recommend calling aladdin if your ever in need of a bondsman.< /review>< Rating>

<review>Amanda at the Fairfield office was more concerned about getting me out quickly and then handling the financial issues that come with bail. I will be recommending her to anyone that I know, she has made this nightmare bearable for my family and I. Thank You Amanda for everything. Will< /review>< Pictures>

Favourite is #10 (Satay Beef with coconut milk). Huge portion. Delicious. Fast service. Messy food. Great prices. I also like #128 (Sweet Caramel) for the dessert.< /text>

They used to have the best priced bang for your buck Bahn Mi from City College to State. A great sandwich to grab and run. Been coming here half a decade and was a great student budgeted meal.  Unfortunately in these last 2 years seen these tasty sandwiches go to almost twice the price for half the meat. Service is nice. Food turnover fast.
Maybe the price reflects a new overhead. Im not sure but either way bummed about the changes.
Still a good option when convenient but I won’t be going out of my way for it anymore.< /review>

I ordered a seafood noodle soup with extra vegetables, and they charged me two more dollars for a piece of bok choy and broccoli and hardly any seafood. . . Total of $15. Not worth it.<//review>

I love this place. And I love that it is 5 minutes away from my house. Their beef stew is to die for! The prices here are also affordable and the staff are super sweet.< /Review>

Solid neighborhood place, always busy, super nice staff, and terrific food. Stand outs are sandwiches (pork, tofu), spring rolls (fried or fresh), seafood & pork pancake, and of course the Pho. High quality but inexpensive. Been many times never a bad meal.</Text>

<text>Food was pretty good but the service was bad. In addition to the poor service, the employees all seemed to be depressed. Everytime I or my friends asked for something, the employees reacted like we were bothering them. We all got a very weird feeling from the employees. Won't go back because there are to many Vietnamese restaurants to go to.</text>< pics>

<Text>Food and prices are ok,  but as soon as you walk into the door, you feel you are in a funeral. All the servers looked so miserable, I believe they just want customers NOT to show up. Yes you read it right. There is no joy in seeing their customers walking in. They are just there to get a paycheck. I asked for water 3 times and the lady just kept on going to the back to chat with her coworkers, which were on their phones most of the time. There is no sense of urgency, customer service or willingness to keep their customers coming back. I asked for the check and the lady came, put it on the table without even looking at us, and walked away.
If you want an ok food and prices, go for it, otherwise just go to a funeral to see the same long faces you will get at this place. Funny how they break down the recommended tip at the bottom of the receipt like they deserve one.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><user>103848079818625749966<//user>< Rate>

My daughter was saying she wanted Pho and that she and her friends went to a place on Ocean.  I found this place on google maps, but when we go here, she said this wasn't the place she went with her friends.  It was already pretty late so we got a table, at first it was less than half full.  They bring tea right away.  We ordered our food, my daughter got Pho, but I got the duck and bamboo noodle soup.  She said the Pho was ok and it smelled really good (actually when you walk in you smell the Pho broth).  The bamboo in my soup isn't your typical slice you get out of a can that many Chinese restaurants server.  I think they needed to cook the bamboo a little more, some was very chewy.  They serve a vinegar ginger sauce for the duck (they serve the duck with bones so watch out).  I wish the broth was a bit richer.

Overall the place is solid, service isn't too great, you order, you get your food, then you flag them down for the check.  My daughter never got her glass of water she request and she gave up and just drank tea instead.

About 8:30pm the place filled up quickly.  When we walked to our car, there was many people double parking, waiting for spaces.

I'll be back to try their other dish, but I'll increase my star points then.<//text>

Don't get dry shrimp and pork noodle.  Not worth the money.  Hot and sour catfish is delicous.  The 5 spice chicken was skimppy portion but delicious.  Order the entree instead. Service was fast.  Tea included.<//Review>

Pretty busy on weekends but service is quick. Pho is pretty good but they're pretty stingy with the Bahn mi (sandwiches) its mostly bread and barely meat/filling. There is a credit card minimum I believe it's $15.<//text>

My wife and I love this place. This was our regular spot to eat after work. Friendly and quick staff, good pricing, excellent flavors. If we hadn't moved, we'd still be eating here 2-3 times a week.< /text>

<review>Ordered two fruit juices from the place while I was eating there. At the time I was on a sugar free diet and when I received the drinks I asked the waitress if there was sugar in the drink, she replied by saying "I don't know, I don't make the drinks" and proceeded to summon a guy who may have been the owner. The guy/owner came to me and told me it was my fault I didn't specify that I didn't want sugar and when I asked him to remake he charged me double. Really bad service on their part, not to mention that two months prior I ate there and had a really bad stomachache for two days. The food is mediocre without a balance in ingredients. I would never go back there.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

The pho offered here is very bland, even ramen noodles have more flavor. I am Vietnamese and the although Vietnamese people do run this restaurant, the food tastes very inauthentic and prepared lazily. Also, it is prepared more Hanoian (northern) style as opposed to Saigon (southern) style which tends to be significantly more bland.</Text>

Pho is lack luster price is good. They charge 50cents for soup containers, leading to a huge amount of food waste. 15$ minimum charge on cc. Service is sub par. Seat yourself, pay at register.<//review>

One of my favorite pho restaurants in the city. This is my standard of which all other pho is compared with. The soup is Rich, the meat is plentiful and just slightly above raw when served. Large variety of soup base noodles, rice, sandwiches, appetizer and other Viet dishes. I've been coming here for over 20 years, still my go to for pho.</text>

<review>Ok so this place isn’t bad. Until this one time. Yes I love pho and who doesn’t. Let me just see if I can get some pho at 9:00 P.M. which is 30 minutes before it closes. NOPE. The place is full of people eating but the workers are probably too lazy to serve people anymore so they don’t have to clean up. Ok well let me go in and ask at least. NOPE. Flipped the sign to closed as soon as a i neared but it clearly hasn’t closed yet because there is still people eating in there. At least walked to the door and politely decline my service. NOPE. They just awkwardly stare from their counter to us at the door. It’s glass. Alright whatever I’ll just go to another one. I’m not going to lie, the food is great but this issue changed my whole perspective and people should know.< /review><rating>1<//rating><date>1518239463354</date>< Resp>

And Jason head of the parts department is amazing in his own right. Stays in touch with all the latest parts and aftermarket parts on the market.
Most knowledgeable person that I know that knows of Polaris razors.
Alyssa, that works in financing showroom floor and helps out in the parts department is awesome Place could not run without her. 😁
I can't say enough about the mechanics in the back their top notch-so-friendly
After servicing my dirt bike it never even ran this good  brand new.
The lighting and Polaris accessories we ordered for our razors very professionally installed I'm so impressed with this place, I was shocked at how they did the lighting so streamline.
Seriously I can't say enough about this place.</Text><response>None< /response>< Pictures>

The manager here is consistently a large jerk. The rest of the staff is usually great. We only go here if circumstances force me to. If it weren't for the manager I would have bought my son's KTM 50 here<//Text>

< Review>
We hit a deer on the way up to Big Bear on our 2014 Victory Cross Country Tour at 55 mph without going down, still being able to ride it back to Palmdale and had about $8500.00 worth of damage to it. I called Tom, who is the owner of Palmdale Supercycles, and asked if I could trust him and his shop in taking good care of us and our bike because of a couple negative reviews. He reassured me that he would take good care of us and that those negative reviews were unfounded which I took his word for. We had our bike towed there and they got to work on it right away. Richard in parts was very helpful in keeping me and my girlfriend informed, he dealt professionally with our Farmers Insurance agent. The guys in service let me go back and check on the bike without being bothered by my recurring presence. We had the bike back together and in our garage in a month flat! That's with some of the parts being sent to Little Design's, which Tom had referred us to, for custom paint which the bike had before the accident. They took good care of my girlfriend and I and were very honest and informative during the whole experience. They still take good care of us to this day. I recommend Palmdale Supercycles to anyone in need of good service, parts or a new or used bike. Thank you Tom, Richard and you Pro's in service!  Ryan & Christa</Review>

Whent there to purchase a new dirtbike for my son not really knowing what size or brand to get him. The staff set us up with a great bike for him. Size and power appropriate. Had a little trouble on a second visit but the way it was handled makes Palmdale Supercycle my dirtbike store of choice. This store has old school integrity and realizes how important there customers are.</Review>

Place has pretty much everything, but getting help in the showroom is a pain. Been there more than once and no one asked me if I needed help. Wanted to sit on a ninja, but signs say so not sit unless staff helps you... doh</Review>

UPDATE: I have called here multiple times and shown up in person and they will not perform any warranty work on my KTM.  Very disappointed with the manager here.< /Text><rate>2</rate>< Date>

I took my tire in for a mount/balance at this location. My tire was then provided to the staff where my information was given. The staff behind the counter is inexperienced and new to the entire process which I understand is normal with fresh employees. I was informed that the young gentleman would be performing the srevices to my article. I expressed that I would not allow a young, inexperienced mechanic to practice on my property and requested the article back after saying, "no, I will take my tire to another establishment." This was not ment to offend either of the young gentleman. I simply did not wish to risk damage to my article nor persue another timely legal battle resulting in a replaced rim. The store manager said "don't be offended, he doesnt know what he's talking about." I found this highly disrespectful as I then left the establishment. The manager was highly unprofessional and unbecoming of a customer service representative. Because of that gentleman's remark, and inability to maintain a professional bearing around customers, I am unable to recommend this business.<//Text>

All hack and inexperienced mechanics.
Not the place to spend your money and get good service.

They don't pay their help very well, so they have a constant turnover of staff and do the customers ever suffer big time.
Every experience we've had with them has been a disaster.

A scarry bunch of hustlers that have no clue what they are doing.
You've been warned!
We found out the hard way.</text>

Walked in wanting info on the 2017 FZ 10. Asked if it had the same crossplane crank as the R1, at that time I had no idea. Owner assured me no other bike comes with that motor. Went home and did some research and sure enough the two bikes have the same motor. If your owner doesn't have knowledge of what he is selling, I'm not doing business with you.</Text>

<Review>Initially not bad. As soon as I brought my bike to be serviced it all went downhill from there. I had a few cosmetic things to be fixed on it. I received my bike about 90 days later due to the technician forgetting to order a third of the parts I needed. On top of that once I took it home I had hardware falling off, along with missing hardware that was not even installed, and to make it even worse the rear side cowling ($100+ part) had all of the tabs broken off by the technician. The worst part was the owner was dismissing a lot of this so I am stuck with it as is (just fyi the AV Kawasaki is owned by the same owner). I had about $7K stack up of parts, and I cannot believe I have to spot check everything they did to it. Never going back, and I advise avoiding it all together.< /Review>< user>

It’s pretty pathetic and some times rude on behalf of the owners part in trying to get deliveries made at this place. Always with an attitude and bad vibes towards the customer. Horrible horrible place.</Review>

(Translated by Google) The butcher shop has very good marinated meat ready to grill, not only the most popular, which is the arreachera, but also cutlets prepared to grill, diesmillo, chicken, etc., really better than other stores.

(See photos) I've been taking my Maltese here for years and they do a great work. I decided to take my terrier puppy in for her first cut and they did an amazing job! Definitely recommend to all small breed dog parents.< /Text>

However,  when I took my pet the following month the whole experience was horrible.  My pet didn't want to go into the shop. They had him for an additional 3 hours pass the initial time frame they gave me. When I picked him up he is in the back by himself.  I couldn't see him I could only hear him barking hysterically.  When I get him his cut seemed a little short but I didn't mind that.  Until I got him home and I realized that they cut him to the pink around his private area and stomach.  To top it off they did not cut his nails. He had the same groomer as the first time so I don't understand what went wrong,  but I do know I won't be taking my fur baby back there.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x8085144c57ca79ab:0xd94fe8bf5403be18<//GmapID></record>

<Text>If you love Your pets do not bring it here I brought in my cocker spaniel on Friday 19 October the staff was very unfriendly in addition the place was filthy and it smelled really bad. It took the staff over three hours to groom my dog when I picked her up I could not believe my eyes. I was so upset to what they did to my dog.They completely shaved her and didn't blend her hair. To top it all off she is missing patches of hair on the back of her front paws. This is the height of laziness!!! The poor thing was trembling when I picked her up and normally she does fine when grooming. My dog doesn't even look like her self. She looks like they took her head and put it on a different dog. Never use these groomers!!!. Their customer service is horrible and they do a terrible job. I am giving them a star because I have to in order to write this review please see pictures attached.< /Text>< Pics>

This is absolutely the best place to take your fur baby. I have two
Mal-shi pups and they do amazing work. Both of my boys like going there and there has never been a problem. The staff is kind and caring.
Please open up SOON!< /review>

<review>Simply avoid this place - far better options out there for self-wash. Here's what just happened today:

Today, my wife took our friendly, 7-year old Samoyed to Tidy Tails to leverage the self-wash station - over the years, we've grown accustomed to doing our own grooming because we found that groomers tended to leave her hair matted and unkempt causing much bigger issues. We were excited to find a reputable place via Google in Tidy Tails.

Here's the top 3 issues we encountered during the visit:

1. They don't seem to have a flat fee for self-wash! They basically assess a cost for self-wash once they see the type of breed you have. It was never clear how much this service actually costed and it seemed like a decision was made on the spot to assess a fee based on our breed - mind you, we do have a fluffy samoyed. :)

2. After the wash, my wife moved to the blow dryer station and they don't have any kind of tables to position your pet so you can actually dry efficiently. Instead, she had to sit on the floor with the dog to blow dry her.

3. ***Most important*** The owner or manager of this facility approached my wife and let her know that she would not be able to fully blow dry our dog because she didn't want her hair blowing around the store. That to me is unacceptable and defeats the purpose of offering a self-wash option to customers. What's the point in washing a dog if you can't blow dry along with it? To me, this signals laziness because the owner doesn't want to have to actually work to keep the shop clean.

My advice to those of you considering this as a grooming/self-wash option: Just go elsewhere. The lack of drying tables is a big enough pain point, but to have the lazy owner/manager amble over to let us know we will not be able to fully dry our dog despite paying the  fee they assessed us is just confusing and in my opinion, kind of useless. I know we'll be happy to spend our money elsewhere where we can have a better experience.

I'd invite the manager to reply, but they're probably out telling others to stop blow drying to care about these reviews. Seems like a failing operation to me.<//review>< name>

<review>For 2 years, I'd drive to Suisun just to get my dog groomed here! My yorkie was always treated kindly even when he's unhappy with nail time. Sad we can no longer enjoy their lovely grooming after moving. This place is small, but you won't be disappointed!</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPsqkLHgsBnMbkPoJy-_We7vNkpho0UJelPvz5s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><date>1580365025057<//date><Rating>5<//Rating><user_name>Opal Romiski<//user_name><gmap_id>0x8085144c57ca79ab:0xd94fe8bf5403be18< /gmap_id><Resp>None< /Resp>< user_id>

Great to find a self wash doggy bath.  My rescue dog will not tolerate strangers so this set up was perfect.  Staff were very helpful.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it wasn't quite as cleaned between dogs as I would prefer.  I will still be back.<//Text>

<Text>This place is by far the best groomers in town.

They care for sure.

I am new to the groomer scene cause I usually do it myself at home.
I called expecting to pay a ton of money and the nice woman named "Bo" she had a conversation with me over the phone and let me know they have self service dog washing.
Blew my mind. Like it helped with my dogs anxiety.

Came to the place they handed me 2 shampoos, 1 conditioner (all hypoallergenic) some deshedding brushes, a wet brush, two towels and a blow drier along with a collar they can use to bathe.

They let you rent out their rubs and the water is like a shower. So you can make it warm! I always felt bad washing my dog in the back yard cause they water is always cold.

Everyone there was super helpful and willing to walk me through everything.

It was 17 bucks for this experience. I came in expecting to pay at least 50 for all this.

I'm coming every week now!< /Text>< resp>

<Text>I've been taking my maltipoo to Tidy Tails for about a year. Last week they told me they were raising the price for a full groom from $60 to $75 because my dog is on the "large side of medium" My dog weighs 20 lbs and is 19 inches long!! They also told me that it's because he's difficult to groom. I said you waited until today to tell me that you think my dog is difficult??!!

There is nothing they do there that is that special to warrant paying $75 and after doing some research, I found that I can take him to Petsmart for a full groom for $55 and a bath for $30<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Place was filthy. The self service wash tubs were clogged with hair from the previous dog, the spray nozzle was was covered in hair. After I’d gotten him washed someone tired to “help” me by putting a chain around him, which was also covered in hair. So thanks I guess, for that. I feel like he left dirtier than we arrived. Observed a couple of their groomers with dogs and was quickly reminded why I groom my dogs myself. Left and went to Tails of a City Dog in Vacaville where everything was clean and staff were pleasant.</review>

<userid>101685979500082654831</userid><Text>I would agree with other post that they could use a lesson in Customer Service.   They seem friendly until you question anything about their service levels or prices. They take a really long time so don't make other plans because your Dog will not be ready as promised.

We have a Cockerpoo- whom I would describe as medium to small with lots of hair that he hates to have brushed!  So as the hair grows out his looks a bit scrappy...  I usually try to have him cut down low, so he needs hair cuts about 4 times per year.  Each time I bring him in, the price goes up? Which had never happened before bringing him to Tidy Tails.  In the 3 years that he has been going there the price has gone from $40 up to $70 (was the quote on the last visit), at that point I politely told them - No, Thank you!

I found Groomingdales, off of Pennsylvanian Ave. We have been going there all of 2012 and are very happy.   Kim does a wonderful job, she is very friendly and finishes him in a few hours.... for only $35.00 and he looks Great!< /Text>< Name>

The location itself was perfectly clean and well kept. I felt comfortable leaving knowing that I am well informed about the loan I took. The employees were bilingual which is amazing to see and very polite and efficient!! Loved that there’s 6 or more feet distance during these health concerning times and that theres sanitizer in the store.<//Text><rating>5</rating>< userid>

I highly recommend this location! I was helped out by Maria as well as Ivette in the beginning. They were extremely helpful and gave me all the information I needed. Both ladies were very polite and nice. Once I was approved for the loan, Jesus helped me go through the process. I enjoyed coming to this location because the staff here are very well mannered and are able to fully explain everything.</review>

<Date>1606257943622<//Date><Rating>5</Rating><Text>(Translated by Google) I really like this store, I already have my second loan requested and approved ... but the most important thing and what I like the most is the good treatment, very pleasant, professional and with a lot of human warmth. They sincerely make your short stay in OPORTUN and through your request very pleasant, enjoyable, responsible and with a very good treatment ... It is when one as a client deduces that they really enjoy their work and what they do ... and all this is reflected in the treatment of their clients .... thank you very much to Jesus, Maria, Ivette and azucena, in short, everyone for their good work and attention.

Me gusta mucho esta tienda, ya llevo mi segundo prestado solicitado y aprobado....pero lo mas importante y lo que mas me gusta es el buen trato, muy agradable, profesional y con mucha calidez humana. Sinceramente hacen que tu corta estancia en OPORTUN y mediante tu solicitud sea muy agradable, amena, responsable y con muy buen trato....Es cuando uno como cliente deduce que ellos disfrutan mucho su trabajo y a lo que se dedican....y todo eso se ve reflejado en el trato hacia sus clientes....muchas gracias a Jesus, Maria, Ivette y azucena en fin a todos por su buen trabajo y atencion.<//Text>< pics>
