<Review>I was recommended this place several times before I finally got myself checked out. I figured having some body ache and pain was a given, working long and sporadic hours, but after the first visit, I felt relief. I knew I wanted to keep returning. The staff is friendly and knowledge. Thank you Lan, James, Dr. Stuart, & Dr. Balta.</Review>< Pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>About 6 months ago, I got into a car accident and was left with lower back pain, shoulder pain and wrist pain. After starting treatment at Neck & Back Pain Specialists, I quickly begin seeing improvements. Dr. Balta and his team have been amazing throughout the process. They’re very professional, caring, and committed to helping you improve. After many sessions of adjustments and acupuncture, I could say that I am fully recovered and can function like I did before I had my accident. I would highly recommend this place to anybody! Thank you Dr. Balta and team!< /text>< Pictures>

<rate>5</rate><Review>I love the doctors and staff here.  They are so kind and helpful.  I first started coming here in 2019 for treatment following a really bad motorcycle accident that nearly killed me.  The doctors did a thorough assessment & came up with a treatment plan tailored to my specific needs.  Today I can say that I feel 10 times better than the day I first walked in the office.

I would recommend this place to anyone looking for acupuncture, adjustments, massage, or decompression.  I've been seeing chiropractors since I was 10 years old and these guys are one of the best I've ever been to.<//Review>< pics>

AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING AND I AM NOT EXAGGERATING! I left work early Wednesday from neck and should pain, my regular Chiro. Was unavailable but I needed someone immediately so I just googled some doctors near by and I’m glad I made the right choice ! Long story short - PROFESSIONAL.FRIENDLY.CLEAN. Just awesome I got the spinal decompression along with an adjustment and a spinal examination along with a foot test which I’ve never seen Before but very helpful with stress and tension areas and that test indicates whether or not you need orthotics or not ! Which I do lol but today I came back for a treatment plan and a massage ! O M G! The massage was soooooo amazing and I mean amazing!! JAMES IS THE BEST !!  Just go and see for yourself ! I am very picky, and I felt at home if not better ! Love love love this place so far !! And the front staff is great as well she’s very professional and kind and helpful Doctor knows what he’s talking about and he is on his game! A1 in my book ! I WILL BE RETURNING  THANKS AGAIN!<//Review>

<review>I was visiting from out of town with severe neck pain. I called them and was able to get an appointment in less than 30 minutes. From the receptionists to the doctors and the wonderful masseuse, I received top-notch service all around. I was tended to at every moment while still feeling very relaxed about my injury. I'd never gone to a chiropractor before and this place sets any expectation I have of the practice very high. 5/5!</review></record>

The staff is always so accommodating, professional, and caring. The doctor doesn't push you into anything, and really explains the process when you first become a patient so you have a better understanding of what to expect and how things work. I recommend this office and its staff to anyone looking for a chiropractor. From when you first check in for your appointment until you leave you are well taken care of.< /review>

Dr. Balta and his staff are wonderful! I injured my back and was in the worst pain I have ever experienced in my life. I had to use a cane just to walk, and even then I was walking very slowly. After my first adjustment I was able to walk without a cane, still slow, but without assistance. I absolutely love going to this office because the staff is friendly and I know I'm going to walk out feeling better than what I felt walking in!< /text>

<Review>Dr. Balta is very caring and informative and he really seem to care about getting my back issue figured out. I have been going to him for about a month now and my back is feeling a lot better but still not quite there but he has made it feel a lot better in this short amount of time then my previous chiropractor did where i spent a lot of money with no real fix. I would definitely give him and his staff a 5 STAR... So far very happy with his practice!!!< /Review>< Pics>

I'm glad that I tried this clinic for my treatment for herniated disc & Siatica which I was suffering for 7 or 9years (i really can't remember bcoz I was suffering for so long), found a discounted 2 decompression & free consultation at Groupon and I was satisfied with the results since day 1 and felt the difference. i know its not a miracle but I was able to walk straight without any pain when I got out  of the clinic. Been with other Chiropractor but I only got a day of relief from pain. Now that I started with their program I can say my overall health is much better. No more mood swings because of the pain, I'm waking up without any soreness, no more numbness in my legs and I was able to do things I want to do before my injury, and lastly I can play with my son without worrying of having a back pain. Thanks Dr. Balta & Dr. Stuart, i know I barely started but all your recommendations and advises proves that it works for me. Also Thanks to Kenia & Kevin they're great assistants, friendly, very much attentive with their clients that you will feel that you've been taken care of and gives me good vibes everytime i walked in & out of the clinic. Thank you guys and God bless!

I highly recommend this clinic for those who's thinking of getting surgery and feeling helpless with their neck or back pain. Come and see Dr. Balta first they might help you!< /Review>

I have been going to Neck and Back Pain Specialists ever since I got into a car accident a year ago. I injured my neck and my lower back. Once I met Dr. Balta amd his staff I felt calm and safe. They made me feel at home and always cared about me. After a few treatments my pain became less and less. Eventhough I am pain free today, I still go to the office because I know it’s important to maintain my health. I recommend them 100% because they helped me go back to my old self.
Thanks Dr. Balta<//Review>

A Must-try!! My late grandma used to bring me (as a child) and my sibs to a local chiropractor to improve our posture, sadly, the latter passed away. For years, I have been on the hunt, finding a good chiropractor who can help me with my back problem. I am on the heavy side, I always have back pains; this worsened when I started my career as a Customer Support, working in front of a computer for prolonged hours. Not to mention, scary numbing of my hands, arms, legs, lips, face, and even my head ( I have a Mitral Valve Regurgitation, a heart disease) I am overjoyed that my Aunt, who is an L.A. nurse, introduced me to ‘Neck & Back Pain Specialists’. Results are immediate as early as second and third therapy. Such a relief! Truly worth it! They have not only helped me with my back problems, undergoing therapies also improved my well-being, to be specific, invigorating.< /Text>

We started going to Dr. Balta in March of 2013. He and his staff have great customer service.  My family and I have improved our life by getting our adjustments once a month.  It has been a slow start but we have seen a hugh in improvement.

<Review>I have old injuries from a car accident I was in when I was younger.  After trying many Chiropractors I was very happy when I finally found Neck and Back Pain Specialists.  The staff is very professional and the massage therapists are excellent!   I would highly recommend Dr. Balta and Neck and Back Pain Specialist to anyone I know.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Dr. Balta and all the office staff are awesome!  When I first started going to this office I had really bad lower back pain and sciatica that was unmanageable, since I've started treatment with Dr. Balta I have felt so much better.  The office staff are very polite, attentive and quick.  I never find myself waiting very long at this office.  Dr. Balta listens, explains, cares and takes his time with his clients.  It is hard to find a place where all the staff are so caring.  I'm very appreciative that I was referred to this office.< /Text>< Pics>

I found them through a Groupon deal for a 1 hr deep tissue massage. And the massage was no more than a regular massage by a girl who had not even completed her certification in massage therapy. It seemed to me that the deal was more a way to lure in new customers rather than make a difference in your body. Plus they made me pay a $15 gratuity charge.

So I got X-rays done since after talking with one of the docs I might need to get some sessions in due to pain I've had in my neck and shoulder blade area. I came back for the results a couple of days later and I saw Dr. Balta who was just a salesman with a degree in chiropratic. He tried to persuade me to get treatment and kept asking me "Do you want to get the help?" I said of course I do but it depends on if I can afford it. He kept repeating to me that he wouldn't let medical insurance make the decision for me in which I told him " I wish I had your financial situation" He kept putting words in my mouth and I was so irritated by the end I walked out of there unhappy that I ever did business with this office.

Also the girls at the front desk don't ask you if you have insurance so you have to bring that up yourself. It's a very unprofessional experience for me.  I don't recommend this place to anyone I care about.</Text>< user_name>

I would like to say a huge thank you to Neck and Back Pain Specialists.  I came to them with extreme upper back pain, that at times, led me to tears.  I called to make an appointment and Cindy was able to get me in the same day.  They have late and Saturday hours which have made it so convenient for me.  Dr. Balta and Dr. Vuong came up with a great game plan and over the last year I have experienced such improvements that I no longer have excruitiating pain or a "tight" sensation.  Once again, a big thanks to the whole office for the wonderful and professional manner you have given me over this past year.<//Text>

Round-about 3 months ago my son and I moved out from Texas. My son suffered from frequent and severe headaches. I myself had been in pain with my upper back and neck. You might as well could say we drew Dr Balta's name out of a hat boy what a lucky draw. My son now goes once everyother week and very rarely has a headache.  I now only go once a week, down from 3 times weekly, and what a difference a good Dr. can make.  I have more energy and my back pain hardly rears up its ugly self.
I also wanted to give praise to the staff.  Thankyou for your always having a smiling face Cynthia and to all!!!<//review>

<review>When I first started going I had back and neck pain. Now i could say thank you to Dr.Vuong, and the friendly staff Cindy and Jenny, they are both very polite, and care for their patients. Now I don't have any more pain, thanks to Dr.Vuong adjustments. I will still continue on going, once a month. Thanks to everyone!!!!< /review>< pictures>

<Review>The team at NBPS is one of the best I've come across.  I found them online while in desperate need to get help for my lower back pain.  I got there, meet with Dr. Balta, received treatment and walked out of there with such a HUGE difference!  Dr. Balta explained everything and answered all my questions, all without making me feel rushed or like 'just another patient'.  He and his staff definitely make you feel at home during your visits.  I highly recommend Neck & Back Pain Specialists!<//Review>< userid>

<Review>Dr. Balta and his staff have been extremely professional and capable.  Their caring attitude has been appreciated in many ways.  I came to Dr. Balta a few months ago after having over 20 years of chiropractic services on an ongoing basis, and after a few months of treatments with Dr. Balta I can finally say that I think there can be some permanent relief to my neck pain.  As a dental hygienist for over 30 years, I have experienced excruciating pain on a daily basis because of my occupation.  After viewing x-rays of my neck area, Dr. Balta was able to target the problem areas and treat very comprehensively these areas and relieve my pain.  I have complete confidence in his treatments and feel myself and family are in very capable hands and recommend his services highly.</Review>< response>

< Review>
I have been going to the Neck and back Center for about 3 months now, I could not move without pain in my lower back and right leg before I started Treatment at the Center. Dr. Balta put e on Decompression Therapy. The first month I went three times a week, the second month was two times a week and the third month was once week. I am going every two weeks now and next month I will go once a month. This Treatment has been a God send for me, I can't tell you how much I suffered before under going this Treatment. Dr. Balta and his staff Dr. Khodi and Dr. Aydin, along with the girls in the front office Jennifer and Cindy are wonderful, caring people who go above and beyond to find the right treatment for you and help you stay healthy and pain free.< /Review>

I was in a car accident about 3 weeks ago and injured my back and neck.  When I first went into Dr. Balta's office I had very little range of motion.  Within  just 3 weeks Dr. Balta and his staff have helped me a lot.  The staff as well as Dr. Balta are very friendly, caring and do a great job of educating you with all the procedures they are doing to help you heal faster.  I have been extremely pleased with Dr. Balta's  services and would highly recommend his practice to my friends and family.< /text>

Dr Balta specialize in lower back and Dr Vuong specialize in upper back.
Both Drs and staff are geniunely caring. I like Jenny and Cindy the assistants, they are friendly and awesome to talk to.  I found them on groupon $39.00 with massage and chiropractic consult which is a great deal!

I like how dr balta educate me on terms of chiropractic. I like how he gives workshops for new patients.  He gives prizes when we answer the correct answer or at least try to. Instead of giving out candy he gives healthy items that will benefit us.

I like how dr vuong adjust my neck, upper back, shoulders and shoulders blades/neck stretches...I feel like I"m getting a lot out of his care.  He also gives me advice on excerises I can do at home and introduce me to machines that would help me. He is down to earth and care for his patients. I hope he works more days or hours so people who work full time can receive his care.< /review>

I had suffered with degenerated disc disease for several years before coming to Dr. Balta and Dr. Vuong. Epidural injections by my M.D.pain specialist and physical therapy did not help. It was a struggle to walk down the hall at work. Dr. Balta convinced me to try decompression. I started to feel better after the first month and by the end of the third month I was back to my normal routine.
Dr Balta and Dr Vuong are very caring and provide great treatment. Their staff is always friendly and efficient. I wholeheartedly recommend Neck and Back Pain Specialists!.< /review>

<review>Noah's Ark used to be my favorite Mediterranean food restaurant, their food used to be excellent, but now they have a new menu, and the food really socks, nothing is the same, all the meats are tasteless, they put a big grill Jalapeño, like if it a Mexican restaurant.
Definitely not the same, very disappointed at their new menu.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Today we mourn one of our favorite restaurants.  I’m pretty certain they changed ownership.  The lush chicken and rich rice has been replaced.  No more salad and no more extra pita. The rice is now, according to my son, like someone grated a potato onto the plate.  My husband said it’s definitely not the same.  At least the fries were good.  If you’re in the neighborhood you could eat it, but we won’t be making a trip out here anymore.</Review>

<review>For all those whom were regular customers of this establishment, be warned. I have been a loyal customer for many years and loved this restaurant (was one of the best in the valley in my opinion).  Sadly, that is no more. I believe that they are under new ownership and have new kitchen staff as their recipes have DEFINITELY changed. Their one amazingly delicious hummus, kabobs and rice are NO MORE.  My stomach is literally upset after this meal. NOT THE SAME AT ALL! Their prices are higher and quality is lower. I feel absolutely ripped off and will never be returning.</review>< resp>

Been going here for years.  The new owners have ruined one of the best Mediterranean hidden gems in the valley.  Every part of the meal was terrible.  The hummus is now awful.  The plates have changed.  No more salad and has cold "grilled" tomato and pepper.  And a side of salsa which was just sad. Even the rice was not good.  They even raised the prices for this.  Everything changed.  They need a new chef.  As is now, I wouldn't serve this to my dogs.  Waste of money.
To the new owners, do the right thing, either close or change your name!< /Text>

First time order from this restaurant.
Not what I expected. My family didn’t like the foods. Cornish Hen was really bad. And meats are over cooked and dry. Rice was bad.
Won’t go back again.
For over $70 foods. Not worth it.< /review>

This is my favorite place. We started ordering from here for our company and it was our favorite place to order.  The best Mediterranean food. Chicken,  kabob,  grape leaves, rice, salad and hummus are definitely out favorite items< /review>

ordered over postmates, fast preparation of the food, fast delivery  the luleh sandwich and chicken breast kabob plate were amazing, everything perfectly cooked and all the sides that I ordered were included (which is not that common when ordering over postmates), LOVED IT! definately will order here again.</review>

On April 15, I ordered dinner delivery from Noah’s Ark.  The order was received and confirmed.  The food never was delivered. I called repeatedly.   They never answered the phone.  I was charged the amount on my credit card when I received my monthly statement.  No.  Never again.  Be careful in this time of COVID.<//Review>

Great Authentic Armenian food. Don't go there in a rush. The dishes are made to order and the meats grilled to order. Large portions too.
Plenty of space for large groups and family style dining. Adjoining banquet area for larger event.

Clean restaurant and bathrooms. Limited parking<//Review>

I agree with most of the reviewers as far as portion size. I had the lamb kabob and it was very good. But the hummus had a sour taste to it. Tahini should have a nutty flavor. Seemed like it didn't have enough garbanzo beans. Also, a little olive oil and cumin would have helped. And it was so thick I  could have filled cracks in my walls with it. I would go back but I would not order the hummus.</text>

Food & Service in this place is good. The ambiance is great too. I ordered 2 sandwiches to take to my friends and they love it, so I told them where the place is at. The only problem I see is the parking, sometimes you will park at the side of the street.</Review>

I did notice that the service lagged a little but I didn't mind. Maybe it'll be a problem for me in the future when I'm in a hurry. This place absolutely has the best tasting Mediterranean food. The meats are all very well made. Once you eat here, you'll spend the rest of your life looking for a place that serves better food.<//text>

I Live In Granada Hills and There Are At Least 4 Mediterranean Food Resturants In A 1 Mile Radius, But Noah's Ark Just Climbed To The Top Of My Taste Bud List...Thank You For The Very Generous Delicious Portions...In A Strip Mall So Parking Is A Little Tight But Very Well Worth The Small Inconvenience ....< /Review>

Excellent good and service. You get served a sizeable portion of pita and hummus to start with. The falafels were perfectly crunchy, would definitely recommend it for someone looking for a casual Mediterranean lunch/dinner experience.<//Review>

My family and I frequently come to Noah's Ark and it never disappoints. This time we came for my fiancés birthday, just for a quick dinner on a Monday night. Place is always clean and it's nice inside.
It was my fiancés first time here and she loved it, so much she wanted to go back the very next day lol she had the fillet mignon and although it was a bit over cooked of how she asked she still enjoyed it.
I had the chicken kabob and it was delicious.
We went with a group of about 10 and we all enjoyed our meal and experience at this restaurant.
The only downside is, I wish the meals came with hummus and you didn't have to order it as an extra side. Other than that everything was great and we will coming back here soon again.</text>

<Review>Great local market! Everything a hiker or passer by needs.  Beer garden area to drink outside the store.

Lots of alcohol, convince food, ice cream ice, propane soda, candy health supplies oil knives firewood canoeing stuff tobacco products shirts, a giant yeti for photos. Great beer selection, hiker cottages, hot showers.

Locally owned and operated. Take and leave a book library.

Great place to stop if you are passing by.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzO0BMdxH-1buufAzYWlyPvWnjLD6FcOc_3LgQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9YE9w9NNT23THLnAbeEQ08pVL4qrVWETgU6MA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7SQuXNMS9ypNb6PmQ7V8Wm8IrM3yy0lsdzRnc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnmEVkz0MhbWwChRt1rEJTAohnc5bB_tYWD2Mo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqt1v-erQDvY0c0DbjbKNo84hVRjBs6AT0l0cL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxWKX1_l0bnLFcV6xRajIUT0dxNE-M3tyNmL5g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfoYPOEJdkIHWzyerMVT3tlnxmB0r2fJ82G7ZC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM34UQN-tHdk68kYhzXp7Su2X2eVWf8qHDSLNEO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvZGCRxUhjFXRob5NcDsB7v52ZheC1FabYk_pO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxPkG4mGi42VidYeSNFZBJQczf4ihgXhkajaWK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTl-xw7-zkOnfdT-0uBm48-JZvcAKsCDn0q7uY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwYg7QIb7ta_P0DfQ8bpnnpqLTPpQQ0mHMPtmi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVYMfXJTZATgiqUSaZ1uUTvEz627mty3uE0rdl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgfnE-R0U-tddjzTsC4hBGYAuvRiTtM8gJbqDF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNo_fZX7D6t1oGSfLA7O49X6wZlT9dspucnVjV7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2EOuTQVx6tLC8JBlF6LSeIPlmjGjYNyXozQ0u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNgrJzaOMqFNkyphxWQ9rYliLz7ZsRcOhprhyo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNG3yVkBh858TzNPbEcKQhFGstwb35UXL3eV7w3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrqHA2HqHbgJWcLmOFE2fgNgSYtm-LXY2lNWtD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfM_Iu5bOHiHEfBbu-yEXtnZeILaPcca5xhu-b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNv-XeCO55dUoJKERIP5C2lF8TWqm1wQgE_UE_T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjRhSpmI_Bg-eoT0hcmsN1blxj_sL9SQrQUomq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0U-5hraGtOE5zbWY1ywucyMRfHX7vffeEiqRT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9yqaW09IRvwxPQ0-C0lp5pLN3QLTbfEriVj2h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqUWM1f1Qm6aVZ5xw1Zu_W6mfJOFi3jcahIpZ0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYqoD1oLjXhUfuK_kQAY89kwo25wcmcC-P7p1t=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOx3Ig8n0EdwfsOAU8kD0xxrdkuGGeKfh7iBCGZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDxbDiaM4dSC2rMmPO0chsMcqdx59KRObqsbJS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6mYGqnhJPawyI2RGpwV5BJh20cxBX5l_UNE9p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmadH7eeSt0AB8Ho2Nq92DJKJgb9X1vtSvTzrM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1615696109449, 'text': 'Thank you!

We met with friends at this place for dinner. This restaurant was recommended to us by a friend.  Well, it was a winning. The staff were very polite and we felt good. The food was just great. We loved this spot very much and we will visit this place again. Highly recommended.< /Text>

So, let me tell y’all how #Amazing this honey is!!! As soon as I opened the lid, the aroma of flowers and honey just slapped me - in a good way.  All I needed was like a teaspoon full to go with my tea compared to store the bought, processed ones where I have to squeeze like 3 tablespoons into the cup to get a little bit of honey flavor. 🙄. Anyway, I went and ordered a few more jars! This is such a fragrant, delicious and uniquely flavored honey that I just didn’t want to wait for the next harvest/season. You guys are amazing at what you do! Please keep it up! Thank you!<//Review>

For a small town convenience store in the middle of nowhere, the Montezuma Valley Market sure is a great place to stop! You can get your propane and firewood here on the way to the desert as well as your beer and tobacco. The store carries an excellent selection of beer that never disappoints, as well as soda and other drinks, snacks and food staples, lots of candy and even ice cream and other frozen foods. You can rent or return UHaul trucks and trailers of many kinds here, you can buy wooden outdoor furniture, lotto tickets, scratchers, cbd and nicotine vape supplies and so much more. You can often find random items you need in stock, and if you don’t see what you need just ask! The staff is all super friendly and helpful, and the owners aren’t just interested in creating an excellent experience for folks with their great stock of items and amazing customer service, they are also very invested in making the community a better place overall. Good people, wonderful store and don’t forget, the Yeti aka Rancheti. One last thing, it’s the only public bathroom for miles. We are happy and grateful supporters of the MVM. 👍🏻👍🏻< /text>

Fantastic veteran owned, local market with a surprisingly large variety of anything you might need. We stop here every trip out to the desert to fill up on snacks and the best honey (from local bees raised by the owners!). The owners are super friendly and kind, and always fun to chat with. Don’t forget the giant Yeti out in front! Our out of town visitors really get a kick out of him and must have a picture with him. Overall, a neat little jewel in San Diego’s back country.</Text>

<Review>This is an awesome place run by good people and frequented by friendly locals with loads of information about the area. The store, while small, carries everything a thru-hiker might need for food supplies, plus frozen food and a microwave, and a pretty solid selection of beer. They're in the process of setting up a thru-hiker hostel, which is exactly what the area needs. For now, it's just bunkhouse, but they plan to add showers and laundry. I stayed there with a few other hikers, and once the store closed, the folks stuck around and hung out for a while. This place will be one of the highlights of my hike.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

You have to put in a min .75 cents in order for the dryer to start and it still didnt dry my comforters smh< /Text>
<pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>
{'time': 1556278104213, 'text': "Ryan I'm sorry you didnt get the most out of the full cycle drying experience.\n\nGenerally, I'd suggest you dry a comforter in the larger dryers which are $1.00 for the full cycle. The larger dryers will dry a comforter in one cycle.\n\nYou are correct that it takes $0.75 to start the smaller dryers, but if you'd have gone to another laundromat and started the same size dryer for $0.25 for 10 minutes it wouldn't have been dry. You could have repeated this 3 times and with all of the stopping and starting of the dryer you would have gotten less dry time for your money and actually had to spend more money to dry your comforter. You got 34 minutes of uninterrupted drying time for your $0.75. If you had checked your load with a minute or two left on the timer and found that it required additional dry time, you can add $0.25 for an additional 11 minutes.\n\nPlease reach out to me and allow me to make this right for you. 323-486-3799"}< /Response>

Lunch/Dinner pre-mades are delicious! Breakfast could use a serious overhaul.. unless you like 98% egg burritos in the morning. It would be nice to see more go into breakfast than egg. Maybe a veggie/potato/egg burrito? Balance out the texture and consistency a little bit please. No one wants 4 eggs in a tortilla, do they?< /text>

Stopped here for gas and on a whim decided to get some Mexican food. I got a breakfast taco by itself. It had an abundance of eggs and bacon, I ate some with a fork before I picked it up and enjoyed the taco. That was a great value and really delicious! The employees were all friendly and helpful!<//Review>

Had a great experience! Thank you Scott for making my truck like new and helping with the insurance claim! The customer service is exceptional and although I hope I won’t need collision services again I will definitely come back if need be!</review>

Dropped off my vehicle for repairs on a Tuesday and Bob had the vehicle repaired and ready for pickup that Friday. They did a spectacular job on the repairs. I couldn’t be more happier with their repairs on my vehicle. It was a pleasure working with Bob (Bob Hauser at bhauser@tombellchevy.com) at the repair center.<//Review>

< Review>
This collision center was really good! My car was really bad when I took it in and they fixed it up really well! Practically looks brand new! I really appreciate everyone who works there and it was good that they truly cared about getting my car done, it was not about the money to them, they truly enjoy what they do! The only minor issue was not getting calls when the parts for my car were in, but that is understandable because they wanted to get my car back to me as soon as possible! Really happy with their work and customer service. I really highly recommend going here!<//Review>

If I could rate with zero stars I would.  The first day after getting my vehicle back from being worked on my check engine light came on with 4 different codes, when I use the remote start to warm up my car it trips the fuel pump and blows a fuse, and my window fell off the track and is now stuck down.  Do not ever go to this place.<//review>

Lol not one 2019 car on the lot this day, not one person came out to show us any cars even after walking around for 20 minutes.  Upon throwing my hands up and starting to leave did a guy coming back from lunch ask us if we needed help.  You guys lost a sale because that weekend we drove to Moss Bros Chevrolet in Moreno Valley.  Actually bought a larger vehicle than we had intended to and funny enough they had to go pick it up here in Redlands and take it to us at Moss Bros in Moreno Valley, found out Redland Chevy doesn't put out the newer cars because they aren't dealing until they get rid of the 2018's.  Third bad experience here at this dealership, won't be going here even to have the new car serviced.<//Text>

<text>Had my 2012 Toyota Prius C fixed here overall the job was good but I had to bring it back 2 times to have something corrected, one was the wheel splash sheild kept rattling. Then the windshield wiper fuild nozzles wouldn't spray. The last thing was the bumper wasn't tightened right, so it kept coming lose on the sides. After this I just said the heck with it and never came back.</text>< pictures>

<username>David R Flores< /username><Review>December 9, 2016, my left mirror on my 2016 Scion iM was damaged by a hit-and-run incident. The mirror wasnt replaced until December 30, 2016. 3 weeks of "miscommunication" on ordering parts and shipping them to the "wrong" location(s) and over priced service and "tag on fees". I was told that I would receive a call about parts coming in six times, never got one call from the shop! Was told I could get a discount because of the various mix ups, but was charged the full amount anyway. Protested that on the spot. Best advice I can give, Take your car to an honest more reliable shop in town. Better service offered and cheaper prices, but will still get professional results.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Really horrible service!! I took my 08 Mustang here after its been in accident to get it fixed, I had ashley worked with the insurance company and she was terrible. I came on a visit after she said the repairs were fixed just needed to get insurancestors to pay them. When I checked out the car my self I was amazed how they got the paint and decals right but I started tout take a closer look and found out the paint was not buffed so it was lumpy, and the bumper was not even on right. I was really mad because she is supposed to notice this ...after all it is her job. So I come back a week later she said it was ready for pick up the decals were not even on this time and the bumper wasn't even aligned right. Most horrible service. Never come back again!!< /Review>

Good environment. But kind of cold in side. The temperature is set tooooo low. I came a couple times in the summer, when more than 100 degrees outside, I have to wear a coat inside the library otherwise I cannot stand more than one hour. It is October now, still too cold inside. I feel I may get sick after stay too long. It is not very environmental friendly; people are not comfortable.. Hope they understand we are not a bunch of vegetables need to stay in a cold environment to stay fresh.<//Review>

A very nice library to study in.  Lots of natural light.  Decent tables to work at.  And the people are pretty quiet (which is good because its a library.  I will be back as I continue my education.</Text>

It's very nice and cool in the summer time. No school so usually packed with kids and teenagers. You can access the computer and printer using your library card or temporary ID. They also have e-books now, not big selections. Public restrooms are available.</Text>

<text>One of the many great community benefits the Friends of the Dublin Library, a non-profit organization made up of local library-loving volunteers, offers is their three times per year Book Sales at the Dublin Library (March, September and December).

It's a great sale to help benefit and enhance the Dublin library. Definitely go if you love to read, listen to music or books or watch DVDs - children's, fiction, romance, mystery, health, foreign language, text books, gardening, cookbooks, science, art, etc. - CDs and DVDs, and audio books. You will find something to buy!

On the 2nd day of the March Sale (Sunday), they have a "$4 Bag Day Special." (As of March 2017). This allows you to fill up a grocery shopping bag for just $4. That day they have the Children's Books marked 50% off and CDs and DVDs at only 50 cents each!

Families love to come to these Friends of the Dublin Library Sales to stock up on their reading, music and DVD watching.

It was my first time to this type of Book Sale. I bought a $4 Bag and also filled up my reusable shopping bag full of Children's books and 9 CDs (classic rock, children's music, jazz, classical) for only $19!

In the Library next entrance, Friends of the Dublin Library has an area to browse and pay with either cash or check into a metal donation box throughout the year during Library hours. I scored on very good condition children's books at 50 cents each!< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlRHiaK9q_zvKMT9TqKQalGUcrKnoPjbK6kZdZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtKyOpDaBIgj6VHUb1gA0aHqzTjZGD38_Pnqrp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZFMQp47xSUxqWNRBiXP9AlgsgN8KtDE8w7EN5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCfuGsW-fL3GZCwDYPaOuoqAWUtdHEtLP8uf_p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFTI59skUGnPQ_i8YQCpFjgO0jUX_OdVeeQKGr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x808fec0e6df6c1e7:0xd12bcf0bbc46b15e</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Medium sized library with nice tables for study.  Sometimes, a bit noisy.  Livermore library is larger and better stocked with books, but I come to Dublin library for the convenience.<//text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Great library for studying and working and of course trying to find a book for yourself or the kid(s). There is a massive kids section, with stuff for all age ranges, and plenty of space to pull take a break and read for a bit with them before leaving.

I've also found some really solid finds on the Friends of Dublin Library for sale rack and auction items. Definitely give those a look when walking in, can find some hidden gems!< /text><username>Ryan Blake</username></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
The EV charging stations work great! Well, that's all I've been around to use... but hey, they're awesome! And the place looks awesome too, at least here at night. And the Wi-Fi is the fastest I've seen yet... can't even tell what kind of connection it is, it's stupid fast - over 3MB/s on a download sitting in my car while charging!<//Review>

<text>Can't tell this is a new library. Especially, book ranges for childeren ( preschooler to school students) are not various and there's no such device like ipad or touch screen for educational games or learning purpose apps installed. Computers only. Books are old and out of update. Limited audio books displayed. Kids zone is not quite encouraging for kids to stay(interior design& kids furniture are far behind compared to current new other libraries)  it is more likely a quite zone for self study. Book Drop off location is inconvenient and it is not a automatic machine to record the date of yr books returned with receipt. I see lots of programs for Adults but elementary kids programs are very limited in this dublin library.<//text><Time>1512756584180<//Time><gmap_id>0x808fec0e6df6c1e7:0xd12bcf0bbc46b15e</gmap_id><user>113593224072228465128< /user><Rating>1< /Rating><Pics>None</Pics>< Name>

Hands down the best staff around!
Corey Brewton and Aaron Hellon were so helpful with getting me into my new car!
From the beginning to the end of the car buying process this was by far one of the best customer experience that I have ever received!!!
I highly recommend purchasing your next vehicle from Oroville Toyota!!</text>

Christine at Oroville Toyota is absolutely amazing. She helped my husband and I secure the car of our dreams, a 2021 Rav4 XSE Hybrid! After having a terrible experience at Chuck Patterson Toyota in Chico, I was thrilled to have a completely opposite experience here. Thank you Christine!</Review>

Try buying a tacoma from Oroville now and you'll see that it's a bunch of scammerstrying to hype people into thinking the tacomas are some super rare commodity and that you should give them $5,000 over MSRP as well as give up the factory incentives. I just bought my 2021 Tacoma from Chico and it was a much better experience than dealing with the tweakers in Oroville. Looks like I'll be buying all my future tacomas from Chico.< /text>< pics>

My wife and I had the privilege of working with Aaron Hellon and Corey Brewton to begin and finish our search for our next new car. They were very prompt and helpful in every way to get the best deal and quick service to get our car. We would definitely recommend anyone looking to buy a car or truck to start with Oroville Toyota Chevrolet! They are the best around!<//Review>

Update: A week or so after my car was serviced at Oroville Toyota I realized that my tires were not rotated. I know this because one of my tires has a really slow leak and I have to put a bit of air in it every couple weeks. The tire with the slow leak was still in the same place after supposedly having them rotated. I was frustrated, but let it go because everyone in the service department is so friendly. Last night I was driving to Chico when my Oil Maintenance Required came on and stayed on. The sticker in my window say I have over 500 miles til an oil maintenance is due, yet my car is telling me otherwise. That was the last straw, I will not be returning. Don’t get me wrong the service I get inside is wonderful, I just wish that the people that were actually working on my vehicle  did the work that I paid for. Truly disappointed.

Nikolaus informed us today that because our car is full synthetic oil we only need oil changes every 10k miles. We recently moved from Stockton and at Toyota town (Stockton) we were getting oil changes every 5k and being charged $89 every time. We came in today expecting to pay for an oil change, a multi point inspection and tire rotation. We found out we only need to have a multi point inspection and tire rotation! He saved us at least $50!!! He could have been dishonest and let us continue to have our oil changed every 5k miles, but he obviously is a man of integrity. We will continue to give them our business and when the time comes to purchase a new vehicle we will go to where honesty is the best policy.< /Text>

<review>I shopped a few dealers and ended up purchasing my new Toyota at Oroville Toyota & Chevrolet. I drove 70 miles to end up at Oriville and it was worth it. Everyone I met was friendly and focused on making sure our experience exceeded typical expectations. The biggest difference was in the sales department, family type atmosphere and very laid back. No pressure and did a great job making sure we got what we wanted. Refreshing!!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Spent hours here trying to buy a car and yet still ended up walking out. Came in with an already agreed on price and a fully approved loan from USAA and it still didn’t work out. Sales managers are typical greasy salesmen who can’t just be honest, and want to scam military.

Response to business response: I don’t have just a “pre approval” with USAA. As I told numerous sales managers we are already approved. We tried to show this to your sales people many times, having to repeat over and over and over and over that we actually have USAA waiting to send a check and not “Just a pre-approval“, and they would never look at it or listen to us during the FOUR HOURS we were there. We asked for the dealership email or fax to have USAA send the approval and loan/check information over numerous times but were continuously told it didn’t matter that we HAD to fill out the dealership credit application. We even specifically said how about just I fill it out, and not my husband, since it was “just policy” and “not actually to apply for credit or a loan”....we were told yes, that was fine. My credit was pulled (which has already effected my credit score) and then a hour later someone we hadn’t talked to at all, with awful teeth, came out telling us how good my credit was but that oops you now won’t accept that even though earlier you said you would and MUST have my husband fill out a full credit application as well. We called USAA while in the dealership and they informed us this is purely a scam and there is no reason for it. No dealership needs to pull any customer’s credit when that customer has already secured a loan and funding. USAA states dealerships only do this when they want to sell your information to their banks in order to spam and scam.

As for the price we negotiated that before I came and then while at the dealership found out we don’t qualify for the $500 off for military because in the teeny tiny impossible to find fine print that only works if we finance through the dealership. We asked if we could have $130 blackout emblems added to the car to help make up for having to pay $500 more than we expected and the dealership agreed. This wasn’t some crazy attempt at renegotiating or asking for tons of add ons. Everyone shook hands, and yet still we could never get anyone to just bring us the paperwork to sign and tell us where to have our bank send the loan info and check. Not ever did someone offer to hold the car until USAA was able to do that. Not ever did anyone even look at what USAA provided us, or was anyone willing to talk to the USAA rep we had on the phone waiting to confirm that we were well beyond a pre approval and had already secured the funds.  We drove two hours down to the dealership, were at the dealership for hours, and then drove home two hours empty handed.
Additionally I tried to call Bob at the number provided and it doesn’t go to him or have a way to leave him a voicemail. Again, more bs.<//text>

{'time': 1581190417080, 'text': 'Thank you for your response P.T but this is not the truth. I,am military and USAA member also. We did pre negotiate the price, but when you arrived you wanted a larger discount or added options which is not what we agreed on prior to you coming in. We agreed to throw in more options and told you the dealership has to do a back up option if USAA doesn’t provide a check. You didn’t want to do that and wanted us to release a $40k vehicle with a pre approval letter only. We would have held the vehicle until USAA paid us and you would not do that either. I run our business by the golden rule with all of our customers and friends . If you were selling a $40k vehicle to someone, would you give it to them with a piece of paper, no cash and no check, I would guess not. We appreciate your business and we truly care about all of our customers and friends. Sorry USAA told you that you could walk in with a piece of paper and take a car without any type of back up option but this is not correct. I would be happy to explain in person or by phone sir. 530-533-4626... thank you, Bob Byrd, Owner, Oroville Toyota'}</Response>

I liked the fact that the dealer I worked with, Thai Lee, listened to me before he spoke. He helped me get the vehicle I wanted. And he was not overbearing. Our discussions were candid and reasonable.

I also appreciated the comfortable atmosphere at Oroville Toyota. There was a spirit of camaraderie, kindness, and respect among everyone-- from dealers, to those in finance, to those in service. Because that existed, I felt comfortable and not anxious. It may not seem like much, but it is huge.<//review>

<Review>Sales Rep Phillpe, French gentleman, is one of the worst out there. I was looking at a truck, Phillipe came out to show me the spec then pressured me into a test drive and as we got back to the dealership from the drive, there was a gentleman looking at the truck. He turned to talk with Phillip for a sec while I was looking at other cars. A few minutes later, Phillips comes walking towards me and proceeded to tell me that I have priority on the truck and we should go get paperwork done because there was another guy who wants to buy it. Little did he know, I recognize the guy he was talking with earlier. He works in services at the dealership. From there one it was pressure after pressure for me to buy that truck. Not a salesperson you’d want to work with. It’s all about commission for this dude. I recommend other salespersons. Seek out Ramon, he’s a great guy!< /Review>< username>

I commend Roy Trumbly for his professionalism and vast knowledge of car consumerism.  My wife and I had a positive memorable customer service experience with him.  When asked for information about acquiring a car from this dealership, Roy T. went on to discuss various options and financial scenarios that helped us narrow down to our final and best decision.  Roy also worked hard and took time to update us with the latest trends in Toyota cars.  When there’s a thought of acquiring your next car, drop by at Oroville Toyota and request to talk to Roy Trumbly.</review>

Their parts department and part manager were extremely unhelpful. I purchased a battery from them and put it in, only to find that it did not fit correctly. I took the battery back in to return and they said because I had "installed" it that they would not return the battery. They offered no help and we rude to my wife the first time she tried to return the battery. I spoke with Jeff (parts manager) on the phone and he offered no help and customer service was completely absent. I will not be using Oroville Toyota for anything again because of this.</review>

We run our business with customer convenience in mind and have one of the highest customer satisfaction ratings for Toyota dealers in the area.

Many times if a customer had a oil change another location, they forget to replace the cap and customers never check until they get notified by us.

<text>I've owned Toyota trucks from 1985 to 2017. Have had many. As far as maintaining them I will only go to Oroville Toyota now. Do not like the service department in yuba city at all, spent thousands of dollars there for shotty work and horrible customer service.  That's not the case in Oroville, I deal with Aaron Miles usually in the service department he is honest. Makes me feel important, and very professional.truely an asset to Toyota. ,and deserves a raise (but keep him in service ) he knows my truck. all the people there that I've encountered  have been absolutley  great .  You won't be disappointed here.<//text><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1530216187110, 'text': 'Cynthia Thank you for the Amazing Review. We love Happy Customers!

Just wanted to tell the owner how impressed I am with the parts dept. I was using another dealer for my Toyota needs ( I own 3) until the level of customer appreciation dropped significantly to put it lightly. So on 10/20-2015 I drove from Magalia to your store in Oroville. I needed a Part that ended up costing about five dollars. The guys in the parts department were extremely helpful and happy to find this simple inexpensive part for me. Not only did they find it, they offered to drop it off at Riebes parts store the next day in Paradise saving me the long drive back to Oroville. I will be doing all my business now at Oroville Toyota. Very impressed, thanks guys.</review>

<Review>AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!! WORST CAR DEALERSHIP I'VE BEEN TO IN 20 YEARS OF PURCHASING VEHICLES.

Nightmare transaction from the start, with a salesman luring us out 2.5 hours to the middle of nowhere, and then having the finance director try to nix the transaction despite perfect credit. Sold my gf a 2wd truck even though we mentioned the need for 4wd on multiple occasions and he knew we live in a heavy snow area SKI RESORT TOWN.

AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE OTHER POOR REVIEW -- APPARENTLY THIS DEALER HAS A PROBLEM WITH KNOWING/MAKING CLEAR WHAT IS 4WD OR NOT.

To boot, the prices are not at all competitive, despite their claim that they "have to have the lowest prices to get people out there." The truck was sold $1,000 OVER recommended purchased price for the 2wd version.

I realize that makes us sound stupid, but our only stupidity was being too trustful of a car salesman who acted like he was checked out the entire 8 hour day and assuming that he was showing us 4wd cars like we asked.< /Review>< Pics>

This place has a wide variety of corals at decent prices compared to some of the other shops. The two guys that were there were likable and helped me find the corals I was looking for. Great experience overall.< /Review>

Absolutely a disaster😕
Placed and ordered, after I specifically ask for a little extra water for each coral to last the long trip to south Florida and to also name each bag. My request where ignored! Most corals arrive dead and package wasn't the best. Store gave me a credit and didn't have the same corals that I order available so I had to use it on something else plus charged me for shipping again!
Definitely not doing business here again!< /text>

<review>I have never been more disappointed in an online coral dealer than I have with Reef Lounge USA. Initially, I was very excited to order from Reef Lounge due to some pretty great sales they had on their website and the chance for free shipping on orders over $300. Additionally, a reefer on Instagram supported their company so I figured I would give them a shot. I placed my order on a Wednesday and figured they might not ship it out until the following week because they only ship Monday-Wednesday. No worries there, I understand. I received my order confirmation email and they said they would update me with a tentative date they plan to ship my coral.

One week elapsed, and I still hadn't heard any updates from the company. Monday I expected an email, then Tuesday, then Wednesday- but nothing. So I called the shop and the lady who answered the phone was nice and told me my corals would be shipping out the next day, a Thursday. I was certainly confused because the website says they only ship Monday-Wednesday, but I was happy nonetheless to get an update at least.

Thursday came only to start the waves of disappointment with this company. First, I get an email stating that they JUST cut my frags, and they needed at least a week to heal, so they would not be shipping out like promised. Any online retailer I've purchased from before only sells pre cut frags, so it was disheartening to see they would be cutting my frags a week after I bought them. Then, 30 minutes later, I notice my bank account has been refunded the amount for my full order and I get an email from Reef Lounge stating that my order has been cancelled for no reason. EVERYTHING that I had purchased (on sale) was still listed as in stock on there website (no longer on sale of course), so I was very confused as to why the order would have been cancelled.

I reached out via email for clarification and to this day have not received an email back. I called 2 times, with a promise to have a call from customer service by the end of the day. I never received a call back. Finally, on my third call, a worker was able to give me an answer while belittling me in the process. He said, "See, this is coral- it is alive. If it dies after you buy it, we can't ship it so what would you like us to do? It is a living thing." The worker treated me as if I didn't know that I was buying livestock. I've been reefing for over 6 years and he mocks me as if I don't know the coral is living? Of course I understand that things can happen and coral may go out of stock. But to never communicate this (the fact that the coral you purchased has died before it even shipped) to the customer is a huge blunder. And no one has ever been able to explain how everything I ordered is still available on their site, yet magically when I ordered it on sale they no longer had any available to ship me?

I have had enough and will absolutely not order from this company. I would advise anyone else to do the same.<//review><date>1613437857330< /date><Rating>1< /Rating>< Response>

I gave in and bought a couple torch’s from a place called ReefLounge online. One of them I received had a cracked head on it and was DOA. The other one lasted less then a week which I communicated to them with emails and pictures and then advised when it died. Initially they said to keep them posted and they will take care of it should it die and once it died they now say sorry but they won’t replace it. I would highly recommend not to purchase anything from them as their communication and quality of coral is garbage.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>If you want livestock fish that are malnourished and with parasites, then order from ReefloungeUSA. Made an online order for a Gem Tang and died within an hour of acclimation.

My personal experience with the reef lounge has been fantastic, I live in Ohio so I’m a mail order customer only and im personally glad I found them I have seen people talking about high prices but honestly their prices are as competitive as they can be in the current market and for what I received I’ve been nothing but happy with my coral , they have answered all my questions via email and supplied their phone number if i needed immediate help with something,I have had 8 different zoas from them 1 being a large colony and all of them where healthy and larger than I excepted there was a 1 day delay with my last order but they where packaged so well they survived it and the store had already told me that if they didn’t they would give me credit for all of them, great job reef lounge you have gained a trusting permanent customer here and I appreciate your great customer service I’ll be back for more soon 👍🏻👍🏻< /Text>

The coral don’t look like the pictures even when you take pictures of them with the filters he ask. I ordered 7 different sps coral from him 3 of them looked like they were the same coral. I sent email without a response until I called 5 days later and  He said to give the coral time to heal and adjust which I did but the colors didn’t get any better. I sent another email with no response again. Very little customer service and the pictures on the site are altered</Text>

Always can count on good advice from the staff. Little long drive from Chino but worth it because of the wide variety of corals that are available and reasonable price for what your getting. Would recommend to anyone.< /text>

Jimmy is a very dishonest Money hungry individual
How does he go by everyday knowing fully that his fish and corals have bacteria on them that will wreck havoc on anyone’s tank. And to top it off he has the worst attitude and worst customer service.  I will be reporting him to the BBB because what he’s doing is a scam

He should pay the grieving widow of X all the fish and coral he stole. WILL NEVER BE GOING THERE AGAIN</review>

<Text>Bought some corals online and when I received them they were ice cold. No heating pack had been placed in shipment. Both acros I got were dead and other corals were in rough shape. Tried contacting them about it and got no response to email or phone call. Won't be ordering from them again.<//Text>< Pics>

< Review>
This fish store is hands-down the best fish store in town. If you have no idea where to park there is a parking area across the street next to that parking structure and you just walk across it's definitely worth it. When you first walk inside the store you can already tell that they take very good care of their tanks not one of their tanks is dirty. The staff here is super friendly and very informative so don't worry if you don't know how to take care of something they are more than welcome to help you and to talk over how to take care of things. We had went to the store to buy some corals and left with more knowledge of how to better take care of them. It's honestly refreshing to see people that care about their customers and not just about money you could really tell that they care about their corals their fish and definitely they care about their customers. I recommend everyone go to the store if you want fish or corals even if you are just starting your first tank go here they are so informative and make it so easy to understand how to take care of your tanks. Thank you again everyone that works in the store for making this experience so easy and enjoyable we really appreciate it!< /Review>

If you're looking for saltwater related this is the place to go. Large coral selections, clean, knowledgeable, but a but pricey.  Overall, it was worth the traffic.</review>

<review>The owner, Jimmy, knows his stuff. If you have any questions, he'll have an answer for you. They have a great selection of corals, live stock and dry goods. If there's anything they don't have, Jimmy will order it for you. The store is well maintained and the prices are very reasonable. Jimmy always gives me a great deal on everything I buy.<//review>< Pictures>

I went to the Fish collection for the first time and was very impressed with the competitive prices and the customer service. The only thing to make this place better is that the store is a little cramped, however they said they would be moving location in about a month or so. Can't wait to check out their new place when they are up and running! Also, if you go to the store make sure to go on a weekend Fri-Sunday as they discount their fish and coral close to 20% on weekends. Love this place, will be going back soon.< /Review>

They post pictures of coral and after you receive it and it obviously no what you order, they then explain their photo was taken u see blue light and the tentacle of what you received, don’t extend out like what is depicted in their advertised photo.  Bait and switch, buyers beware.<//Review>

<Text>4/4 visits... Prices are higher than their competitors(not counting the infested $5 frags). Each time there was a different kid working and each time they were arrogant and belittling. I had to trash the frags that I purchased on 2 separate occasions as both had very unwanted hitchhikers...($125.00 gone). I didn't bother asking for a replacement for either since on my fourth and final visit I noticed that these issues were present in the majority of their tanks.

Perform a very close inspection on any potential purchases!!!

8 months later....

Update: Decided to give this establishment another shot and things did not go well. First off you should know that they are trying to bury the negative reviews by offering 20% off your purchase for a positive yelp/google review. So this explains why there are so many good reviews. It also explains why the prices are higher than their competitors...
(overpriced coral - 20%discount  = regular price).
That being said, I walk in the door and it’s like he’s been waiting for me since the day I posted the original review. As I said before I have only had interactions with his his rude minions, so how he knew who I was is still a mystery.
He walked up to me and loudly asked how long I have been doing this(as if length of time spent in a hobby somehow dictates the level of respect/service one should receive). I replied that I have kept FW and SW setups since the mid 90’s... he then proceeds to argue with me about this review which naturally got his minions chuckling.
Now I’m no business man but if a customer has a bad experience and you have the opportunity to win back that customer you should
1.) Probably not cause a scene in your establishment with said customer, especially when other customers are present.
2.) You should not attempt to bully/belittle said customer into changing their mind
3.) Possibly take a business ethics/anger management class

Want positive reviews?

Jimmy takes good care of his store, and really cares about his fish and corals. He will tell you not to buy a fish if it's not right for your tank. I noticed another review said the fish have parasites. Let me tell you, every fish store has fish with parasites, it's part of the deal. It's up to you to pick a healthy fish OR don't be lazy and quarantine your fish to make sure they are not sick.</Review>< UserId.>

I changed my review from 'one of the best' to it IS the best reef store in southern california. Huge selection of coral, and an always changing variety of fish available. Jimmy is a master and offers plenty of advise, even for new comers to the hobby.</Text>

<review>I don't know what the guys that rated this store with a one star, but the reviews I read from them I would strongly disagree with.  I have been to many, maybe all, fish stores around the area, and none of them compare to the Reef Lounge in quality of livestock and coral, knowledge, prices, and helpfulness.  They will help you with any questions you need.  I've been to other stores that didn't know answers to some, but the Reef Lounge did.  Great family owned store and the ONLY one I go to for all my needs.</review><UserId.>116053203535658582560</UserId.><rate>5< /rate></record>

Wow...live an hour away and this is a great store for Saltwater fish and corals. Prices might be a bit high but for health, selection, size it is hard to compare with others I have seen.< /review>

Super selection, very knowledgeable staff. I would recommend to anyone. I'vehad zero issues with buying anything here. Speaking on some of the negative reviews....I get when you buy something you expect certain things from it. When you are dealing with anything live and in large quantities, there will be a few issues here an there, especially with marine animals. Not sure everytime or anytime something happens it dictates a bad review here though. Most all of them obviously have been coming here for awhile and should understand what it means to buy live aquaria. Anyway, the staff here will guide you right and the selection is one of the best in all of Southern CA!< /Text><response>None< /response><name>Carl Brinker< /name><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

VERY HELPFUL!!!! I live in New Hampshire and new to saltwater. I have a 15 gallon nano cube. The tank was set up for a pair of Hippocampus Erectus Seahorses. A few days after I brought them home one was laying on the sand. Eyes were moving normally. All the fish stores were closed because New Hampshire is eastern daylight time. I was panicked. My husband suggested that I call another State that is pacific daylight time. I went on line and found Reef Lounge USA listed and sells seahorses. The man I talked with was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. The fact that he knew he wouldn't get any business from me because of where I live didn't stop him from helping me. He asked what she was hitching to. Apparently what they hitch to will determine how they can hold themselves up. I was so relieved. I would highly recommend the Reef Lounge USA.< /Text>

Place is great family owned and operated,  Jimmy (the owner) is very knowledgeable, and can answer any and every question you have.  I've read some of the other lower star reviews and almost don't believe it's the same store... Fish collection???  This is reef lounge,  maybe they have changed there name but I've been coming here for almost 2 years and it has been the best fish store I've ever been to.  I've purchased fish and taken them back the next day for a full refund/exchange. Not because they were sick but because my other fish were aggressive towards them.  I've had a red serpent star start to lose its limbs and was given full credit when I came in with what remained.  They have helped me solve a red algae problem,  and if I have any concerns about added something they give me stright answers. Often times telling me,  you can try but I wouldn't do it, or a flat out know you don't want this.  In fact I haven't had a single fish die from the store other the suicide because my flame hawk jumped out of the tank... Which they warned me about.  Anyone giving this place a one star knows nothing about the hobby and is probably upset because they didn't realize how expensive it can be and how difficult it is to maintain a nice healthy tank if your trying to do it cheap.  This place will tell you how to do it the right way,  at a fair and competitive price.  You might find something cheaper on Craigslist like one reviewer mentioned,  but it's CL and probably a scam... Though he didn't say how many bags of live sand he bought in his review but he did say he still got a $25 refund for some price matching.

I've been to other stores in the area,  and have had the owners just make you feel dumb for asking questions,  that will never happen here.  Id give it 6 stars if I could.<//review>

< Review>
My best friend and I (we’ll call him X), had a huge passion and bond for saltwater reef and fish tanks. I had just acquired a custom 75 gallon tank that needed EVERYTHING, and X wanted to purchase a 150 gallon tank. In 2009 I was introduced to the owner of Reef Lounge Jimmy, by a friend who use to build custom tanks. X, bought a 180 gallon reef tank with everything from Reef Lounge, and the tank was beautiful, with beautiful fish and coral. X, Jimmy, and I maintained a business relationship for years. X maintained more of a friendship because Jimmy did monthly maintenance and cleaning. But as time went on the maintaining and cleaning started to slip.

April 2nd, 2016, I lost my best friend unexpectedly. His widow and children were of course in mourning, and his widow (knowing Jimmy was X’s friend) asked Jimmy to take the tank out of their home, and hold on to it until she and the children moved. She wanted to make the tank a memorial for her husband, something his children could enjoy, she could enjoy, and his friends could enjoy. X LOVED that stuff!

So this is what Jimmy did. Jimmy removed the tank from X’s home. He then resells the rock, fish, and corals to his employees because, “I had to pay my employees to move the tank”. Why wouldn’t he just bill the widow? For 2 hours of work his employees received 3 Kessil lights, a protein skimmer, refugium lighting, wave pumps, wave controller, chiller, and everything in the tank. Adding this up he paid his employees over $3000.00 to break down a tank (for a grieving widow) that took 2 hours.

I’m writing this review because that has to be the most unethical, sneakiest business man I’ve ever met, and this story needs to be told. I went in there to look at the tank, it’s chipped, missing hardware. He has yet to speak to the widow. I’ve let her know what happened to her husbands tank, and the unfortunate condition of what’s left of it. Where does she go from here, is of course, up to her, but felt what happened with Jimmy at Reef Lounge should be told. And I guess leave it up to you to decide if you want to deal with someone who could do that to someone at their lowest time.</Review>

I've been on the marketing research for years. They are following all the COVID protocols and I'm able to make a few bucks for my opinion on items up and coming.  As always, great job PK. 😊👍💯</text>

Great way to make some money. Sign up for their food testing. When you fit the demographic they will contact you with appointment times to chose from. Usually its 20 to 50 dollars for an hour. You will try food or beverages. The staff are good people.  You are Paid in cash before leaving.</text>

The call center reps are very rude and disrespectful whenever I talk to them. None of them seem to like their job and sound bored on the phone.< /Review>

<Review>A favorite for decades between my friends and I. The dishes are tasty, good portions, average prices for a specialty restaurant. They increased their outdoor seating area by taking up the parking spaces that used to be there in front. This has worked in their favor, not only for socially distancing, but also in getting further away from the stench of the cigar place.
As always, the servers are kind, attentive, helpful.
Felix's has definitely earned its reputation for great food.<//Review><time>1622868799247</time><user_id>103348086000199419197<//user_id></record>

One word to describe the favor, wow! The best Cuban food I’ve ever had to include spending lots of time in South Florida. This is the best.</review>

<review>This place has a lot of good people who served the customer. They make sure you’re satisfied with the food and the service. They have pretty good deal with the food. If you select the meal, it comes with appetizer and dessert. And the price just incredible inexpensive. . . Since the pandemic, they just serve outdoor dining. But do not worry, at night, they set up the table with heater too...< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLGLgNUofP9YSjk9SJ0zGqZpXut7SuAiRh00I2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnX1loR5CAsnSDB9cAUvVzJr86FJb0QISrZVnl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNY0Ad8XDikMfY0xggFj2bRc6IZbGSacFwncyXS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkUX9cF-V_oXmSOZq9H1vOoppuLi6h2p5TUPbu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHl25-PBImlsosywnDg24BYzZ3OIHJlS5USldM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1Dc_Z_JXrdiJguxcIPJZbFf08nV9H6LOx79_P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNH5W-tbtw8_wC4fqlUqWo6B9cTXVBX7FqUJttk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80dcd9e711e3d2c7:0x4c949f7825fb303e< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Though the price is not that affordable, it's all worth it for the yummiest food they served. The quality of the food and refreshing drinks are world-class. The service is also outstanding. You won’t be disappointed with this restaurant. I can't wait to visit here again. Highly recommended!<//Text>

It's stunning! That's incredible! It's stunning! It's breathtaking! Here are all of my favorite foods, in no particular order! The town's most reliable and reputable restaurant. I never expected such a fantastic restaurant to have such a wonderful staff and chefs who could prepare everything I wanted. It'll be well worth your money!< /Review>

<Review>Lovely seafood and even better cocktails in a superlative setting with stellar service. We enjoyed our New Year's Day dinner and drinks here. Our waitress, and Kevin, really looked after us and we enjoyed his company. This was one of the highlights of our holiday! Worth every penny would definitely go back again and recommend to all of my friends.</Review>< name>

<Text>After knowing about Felix for decades, we finally ate there tonight. Being indecisive, I had the Felix combination on the "Caribbean" menu; my brother had the red snapper. Both were delicious. Also ample, accompanied with soup (red bean) or salad, plantains, and even a dessert.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

It was an amazing experience, and the food was to die for! After arriving earlier than my reservation, it was a good feeling that the restaurant had seats available upon my arrival. Not to mention, the food was great. I cannot wait to return to this restaurant with my parents, so they can experience the restaurant's greatness!<//text>

<text>I love this place. I have been going to it since 19 88. The service is excellent, attentive but not intrusive. Quick delivery and your iced tea does not get more than half empty.

Pollo Criollo is perfectly seasoned and exquisitely tasting.  It is the height of compliment to have that excellence and consistency for that many decades. The first taste brought tears of memory back to my eyes. We used to go for work lunches from TRW to enjoy some fresh air around the Orange traffic circle. About back memories of wonderful times with wonderful people. As I gazed around the patio, that phenomenon and magic still occurs.< /text>< date>

My family and I were so happy and satisfied with your dishes. Your staves were so accommodating and fast. We were so surprised when they served our order after 5 minutes of waiting. You are the best, guys! I should strongly recommend you to everyone! Thanks!</Text>

Having been to Cuba, the food at Felix is authentically Cuban. The service was super fast. We ate inside, where the atmosphere is nice enough but pretty basic -- you are not in a trendy new place. There are sidewalk tables as well, and since Felix is on the circle, they are pleasant (and were fully occupied). We will be back.< /review>

Love felix's. Be sure to get the salad with their home made ranch-its amazing! Get the combi with the entree, salad and dessert..lots of food for about 20 bucks. All the food excellent but my go to dinner is the chicken supreme< /review>

<text>I used to have lentil soup and black pudding salad. Artisan bread with broth is stronger than sliced bread. The egg yolk with the black pudding will be softer. The staff are attentive and the restaurant is lovely, I'll certainly be back, it can be hard to find good soups and salads, particularly at an affordable price!<//text>< Pics>

We were met at the entrance by a beautiful smiling hostess who led us to the main restaurant. We were met by George, the manager who introduced us to the seafood menu. I got a glass of Cabernet  Sauvignon, which complimented the food I ate. We enjoyed the ambiance of the place, the food, and the service. I will surely recommend this restaurant to all of my friends!</review>

<review>I ordered food to go.
There were only 4 skinny yucca fries fir my order, they looked like McDonalds French Fries and the Levon was tasteless. I actually threw it away. It tasted like it was boiled .
The last time I got food to go , the fried pork as super dry.
I won’t ever get food to go again. I am very disappointed after going there since 1998.</review>< Pics>

Not to mention the food's delectability. I ordered the sticky honey shrimp with garlic butter, which was tasty. I'm certain I'll be back! We decided to stop for dinner at this restaurant because my mother was visiting and staying in the neighborhood for the evening. We were seated immediately, and the service was excellent.</text>

This restaurant is a gem! The menu was well-designed and has lots of variety which I like. In addition, prices were fair for the quality of the food which I appreciated so much. I love the ambiance and the location of this restaurant. The staff was also incredibly kind and provided top-notch service. I will definitely come back here soon.< /Text>

<Text>It has been a while since I've eaten here.  I had the chicken a la orange,my husband the roasted pork. Mine was good but the sauce was cold and coagulated. My husband's was excellent. The beans were also very good. His plate had white rice, mine had yellow, which I'm thinking perhaps had saffron. The plantains were really delicious. Mine also had a onion side. I'm not really sure what else was in it but it was good with the chicken. The onions were crunchy but not overpowering. The service was good. Forgot, I got a piece of tres leche to go. I  wish they whipped there own cream,  it has completely melted by the time I got to eat it, otherwise it was very good, albeit very small.  Overall it was very good and I would recommend it.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Felix Cafe always has some of the best tasting chicken in my opinion. I love this place for beans and rice. They have good appetizers as well. Outdoor seating and a cigar shop if you're into that. They have some killer 3 leches cake. Very tasty!</Text>

Right in the heart of old town orange and close to Chapman university. It's in the round about. Parking might be difficult since its really happening place. The dining space isnt that big but the taste makes up for the space restriction. The ox tail was terrific and so was the flan. The portions were plenty as well.< /Review>

It has authentic Spanish and Cuban cuisine and an extensive menu.  We got the table right in front of the restaurant facing the park.  The best table to people watch!  We got Caribbean Delight, it had fish, calamari, scallops and shrimp.  Also plantains and rice.  It came with fish soup and bread pudding for dessert... so good.  The plate was scraped clean!  Also the coconut shrimp for appetizer, so crispy and fresh.  You have to get the sangria, a beautiful deep red with blackberries.  The best sangria I have ever had.</text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>I always have a great time at Felix Cafe. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. They also serve pretty big portions as well so eating there is bound to give you another meal in leftovers. I have been here many times and seem to always get the Felix combination. I love this dish as it mixes chicken, beef, pork, and fish with some rice and bell pepper and onion. It seems to have a mix of everything and is very delicious. I definitely recommend Felix.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Went to Feliz tonight to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. Our first date was here so this place is special to us. The menu is great,  Cuban with Caribbean flavors and enough food for even the  hungriest connoisseur. The service was very friendly and very respectful. This place will always be part of our story.< /Text>

<review>One of the oldest places in the circle and still one of the best. I'll never pass up a chance to get their paella or their empanadas. Prices are incredibly reasonable for the generous portions, with that huge bowl of paella being enough to feed two very hungry people with ease for under $15.< /review><gmapID>0x80dcd9e711e3d2c7:0x4c949f7825fb303e< /gmapID>< resp>

Always a family favorite. Felix is our go to for Cuban food in Orange County. Everything is scratch made, flavorful, and with excellent proportions. Absolutely to try are the Ropa Vieja, Rabo Encendidio, Tres Leches, Roasted Pork, Arroz con Pollo, and the Cuban Sandwich, Steak a la Cubans are all must-haves! delicious< /text>

1 Star meal: not even the manager, after issuing me a full refund, could tell me what this menu item was (no.9). Served warn, not hot. And bland, oh my was it bland.

1 Star service: I believe our server was given too many tables to serve. The result being I felt rushed, not heard, and in the end forgotten.

1 Star management: I had to come back twice to receive a refund. The first time I asked for a refund, the person in charge said I needed come back to speak with someone else.

When I came back the next day to see that person, to my dismay, the servers pointed out that same person I spoke with the other day. They said the guy I'm looking for is the one wearing the red shirt, sitting in the circle of men smoking cigars. Yep, it was the same guy from the day before. The same guy who told me I needed to speak to someone else. Well, he walked me back to the restaurant and gave me a refund.

I believe, depending on what day you go, what time of day or night you go, who is cooking that day or night, and how busy they are will determine the quality of the meal and level of service you will receive. Hence the wide range of reviewing experiences, all of which I believe true.</Review>

<text>Food is outstanding! But the service was awful. Had to wait for the simple things we had to request like drinks, napkins and bill. Which took forever to get him to bring to us. I asked the waiter to get clarification if my meal came with a dessert. As I needed to request it to go since it took so long for him to get order. He said "we would talk about it after he delivered the food". I then waited.... food served and he was not to be seen until the bill to be paid. O Asked him again and he said yes the I could go inside to get. I said for him to bring me it back in a Togo. It took him forever to do so! Then I received the included dessert... it was a postage stamp size piece of cake. Really one bit if that! He was taking so long to service one of the people in Our group went to buy a cigar... he left the bill on the table after giving to waiter his credit card. The waiter came over and said that he needed the signature. We said sorry he will be right back he is buy a cigar in the shop next door. The waiter told me to sign for him. I said I can not do that for him. He kept asking for signature. Then notice in bill it said NO SIGNATURE REQUIRED it was printed right on the bill he was trying to get me to sign! Fantastic food awful service! Still would recommend going. They just need to hire someone more customer service orientated!< /text>< Pictures>

<Gmap_id>0x80dcd9e711e3d2c7:0x4c949f7825fb303e<//Gmap_id><review>This place use to be good and i have been disappointed the last 3 times ive gone. The Frita use to be excellent many years ago but its not any more. The meat is different. They use to serve it with a hand made patty but not anymore. The garbanzo beans were hard and the server said that's the way they are, but I don't think so. They were undercooked and were only luke warm. The ranch salad dressing was plain and taste like nothing,  so i guess they are trying to save on cost there too. We asked for napkins and never received them and couldn't even get the server back to ask for condiments. This will definitely be the last time going back.< /review><Rating>1< /Rating>< response>

Before all of the new fancy eateries went in, there was Felix’s. They have been serving Cuban food for quite awhile. Delicious food that is different and a nice change of pace. I love the Pollo Criollo that comes with yummy black beans, white rice, and plantains. So good! Simple and fresh. They give you plenty of bread and butter to enjoy with your meal. The flan is absolutely wonderful. This is a great restaurant to sit outside on their nice patio and enjoy the beautiful historic Orange Circle.  Location and food are awesome. I highly recommend Felix’s Continental Cafe.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

I wish I had remembered to take pictures because the food here was beautiful and delicious. I had never had real Cuban food before, I am Colombian and the food is not that similar. Great place to go get something healthy. They have paella which is also Colombian: yellow rice mixed with some seafood and vegetables. The thing I got was chicken with shrimp with sauce with avocado slices on top and it was delicious. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful. Even though we got their kind of late they let us hang out and eat while they cleaned up. Very friendly place highly recommended. I added a pic of the cool Latin-looking Starbucks next door.</Text>

<Review>The quantity of food was surprising. One dish could have fed two of hungry me (I weigh about 130 lbs). In fact, I brought home the left overs and ate it over two meals. The staff was friendly. I would love to come here again.< /Review>< pictures>

The musics was too loud! The service was friendly but the kitchen was slow. We ordered a little bit of everything . The only thing I can say that was great was the corn on the cob, everything else needed more flavor. I would suggest using better rice for the Moro. Not a fan of this spot.</text>

Everyone in the family has their favorite--Aporreada de Ternera (Ropa Vieja), Steak a la Cubana, Felix Sandwich (beef and onions on a baguette), Roasted Pork, and Chicken ala Orange--all highly recommended. Tasty sides of creamed spinach, maduros, tostones, and a host of great appetizers. Yum!</Review>< pics>

<Text>Pork was so dry and it tasted like it was put in the microwave 5 times. I can't imagine that is what quality Cuban food taste like. The Italian dressing tasted like pure garlic sauce. The rice, beans, plantains were good. Was looking forward to eating here. Owell.< /Text>< UserId.>

<Review>Felix Continental Café offers an amazing breakfast, brunch and dinner. I've dined here twice for breakfast outdoors. The staff is very attentive. Last visit I had the salmon medallions, a piece of breakfast burrito and pancakes. Everything was delicious. Orange juice is fresh squeezed. Dogs ordered a side of ham and are welcome on the patio. I've also had dinner here with satisfying portions to go. Recommend dining here for any time of day. Great spot.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>This place was recommended to us on a business trip and it's one of the best meals we have had on all of our travels. The brussel sprouts were the best we've had anywhere (and we tend to eat a lot of brussel sprouts). The atmosphere was a little more upscale than your typical restaurant and the menu selection was great (aka we wouldn't bring our kids along).<//Text>< Rate>

<text>Best Caribbean food in SD!! If you think otherwise inform me. I've had everything from the oxtail, goat to chicken and they never disappoint. Granted some comes off the bone better than others some days. They get busy so I'm guessing the rush is the difference. Better to call ahead and place an order if you don't have time to wait.< /text></record>

Food quality was poor for us as we dined first service on a Friday night.

Just a thought...when your food is starting to turn bad, throw it away. Don't put it on my plate then charge me full price for it!< /Review>

People watching is fun as they come from 4 corners of the world. If you haven't dined in Cuba, then you cannot objectively review Felix's.

The tres leches cake was delicious! It tasted like they made it inhouse, unlike most restaurants. It was plain, just vanilla flavored but so good. The side dishes are amazing, especially the moist yellow rice. My chicken was okay but still worth 5 stars all together. They charge refills but I didn't even use it, the entrees are big!< /Text>

Stopped by here a couple of months ago after a bit of drinking. I can't remember much about the experience except 1) it smells real, real bad, and 2) the food was incredible and well worth sitting in what smelled like a giant cat box.<//Text>

The Felix Continental Cafe was absolutely fantastic, the Felix Continental Cafe was delicious and the wings were the best I have ever had. This traditional Caribbean restaurant has an open kitchen where you can watch the owner/chef prepare each dish with care. Definitely going back. Its a short walk from Orange.</text>

<Text>Big portions. Free bread. Delicious food. I crave it! My favorite is the Oxtail entree but I've ordered just the rice, beans, and maduros on occasion for a simple, hearty meal. All the small plates/appetizers are fantastic too. Don't even get me started on dessert... I have tried them all and loved them.. rice pudding especially. You gotta try this place out!< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Had the Salad with Tuna Salad and fruit and it was amazing.  Friends had some sort of burger and everything was awesome.  I have been going to Felix's since the late 1970s.  Always great food and service and it was so nice to sit outside this afternoon.< /review>

We sat outside in the cafe seating which was very pleasant. But it was the food that I'm here to rave about. I had the Crepes Supreme which was delicious! As for the service, it was friendly, timely and attentive. I'd recommend this place to anyone.</review>< pics>

40 years on, this place still is on their A game. Delicious Cuban dishes. A little pricey, but in line with the iconic location at the Circle in Orange. Park in the lot to the Southwest of the restaurant, then walk through the alley to Main St, then half a block north.< /Review>

Felix's is a great place with a great authentic cuban atmosphere. The staff is always so friendly and inviting. This place compares to (if not better than) Versailles, the famous cuban cuisine restaurant in both Miami and LA.<//Review>

<text>Great food, great prices, and beautiful location in the Orange Circle. I miss the food here! Whenever I'm back in my hometown I eat at this gem. Feels like someone's grandma is cooking in the kitchen. Yum!
Juan was our awesome server, and I can't believe he always remembers us! He is the best and has been there as long as I can remember.
Food is so good, we ordered extra to take home with us.</text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

This is one of the few restaurants in Orange that my family and I will go to when we want to have a reliably good dinner. Everything, from the staff, casual atmosphere, and of course the delicious food is right on point. Just a heads up, there is a cigar store next door, and people will smoke out there, so you'll want to eat inside. We have never had to wait for a table inside, even when it's relatively busy. The portions are hefty enough for my wife and I to split a plate (we like the Sailor's Seafood Casserole). Delicious.</text>

Excellent service! Food was fine but a bit oily. Indoor seating was cozy in a comfortable way. Very accessible. Wine and beer available. Tres leches cake was delish once it came close to room temp. We plan to return for lunch. This visit was for dinner.< /review>

A few Yelp reviews mentioned ownership changed when the original owner passed away. After my first try at this place I think that's true. Flavors I tasted were not authentic Cuban, more like a poor imitation. Prices and portions are good as you get a sale and dessert with the specialty entrees so it gets two starts. The soup I had was good but dessert tasted like instant stuff from the grocery store.<//Text>

<review>I hardly ever give restaurants 5 stars but I have absolutely no complaints about Felix Cafe.
-Food was excellent. Very unique and flavorful.
-Great, fast, and friendly service.
-Large portion for the price.

I review a restaurant on 4 criteria:

food: 5
service: 5
decor: 4
price to portion ratio: 5

average score: 4.75, rounded up to 5.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Text>Another Cuban restaurant that has lost what they once were.  Ever since the Father passed the manner in which they cut corners on cooking the food saddens me.  Saturday was and is Garbanzo Bean soup day. Best soup I've eaten besides my moms.  Buuttt... Now they are using canned garbanzo beans instead of the original way they use to do it. How can one tell.... The beans are stiff and hard and they do not let it simmer long enough to obtain the flavor of the seasoning  or the bean to open properly.  Too bad it is a rare gem being lost.  Ramon we or I miss your dedication to making your customers happy with the quality of food and service<//Text>< pics>

<text>Tasty authentic Cuban cuisine, but everything on the menu is not always available, so If you have a favorite dish, make sure you call ahead and confirm the availability.
Very cozy setting, but not a lot of leg room. Outside seating is available.
Great for couples and coffee.< /text>< pics>

Wow, what amazing food.  I had a beef dish stuffed with chorizo (#8) served with rice and beans.  The red sauce served over the meat was absolutely delicious, the beef was fork tender and the black beans were flavorful and perfectly cooked.<//review>

The food was great as always. They have the most authentic Cuban sandwich around. It was strangely empty though. It is usually packed. It maybe due to the parking issues in the Orange circle and increased competition.</review>

The food was always fresh and tasty. It’s a Cuban place so many of the dishes are Cuban delicacies, but they also serve American food. Be back again and try their other dish.< /Review>

<Text>Absolutely one of the best bargains between San Diego and Los Angeles. The food is excellent and the service is better than 99% of restaurants within their price range out there.  Don't ask what to order, follow your heart - it's just THAT good.  My go to is the red snapper- but it's no ordinary dish.  The entire staff is like family.  They are loyal to the owners and loyal to the customers, many who've been going there for over 25 years.  This is not just a restaurant, it's an iconic American venue< /Text>< user>

<Time>1369359263794<//Time><Review>I love Cuban food, but I'm not sure Felix gives a great representation of it.   The portions are huge so you definitely get your money's worth, but it's missing a lot of the spice & flavor that I love about Cuban cuisine.   This would be a good place for someone who is unfamiliar with the cuisine though, since it's very mild and less "ethnic" than traditional Cuban food.< /Review><Rate>3</Rate></record></dataset><record>

We went here because we miss Nandos, and these guys have a similar concept. The food tastes good, but don't go in expecting it to be like Nandos because it's not. I still like it though! The service is also great!<//Text>

There's a reason this place is always packed to the gills and there's a crowd waiting to get in. Located in the heart of the Old Town Orange Circle, Felix is known for a mixture of Latin cuisines offered for lunch and dinner. It's advised you arrive before it opens and with your whole party present if you want to be seated right away.<//text>

One of the best restaurants in Orange if you want casual food. Come on a good day and enjoy the outdoor seating. Roast pork is awesome.< /Review>

<review>This is a small cafe with great food. I ordered the media noche sandwich and it was perfect. The staff was attentive and friendly.  The low point of the meal was the espresso I ordered afterwards. They used instant coffee. I'm sure they have limited space in the kitchen area, but the coffee did not have the same level of quality as the food.<//review>< Pics>

On Vaca to Cali and we went on our last day. Best food I've had all week. Possibly the best Cuban food I've ever had, and I go to a TON of Cuban places. For the Palomilla steak you get either soup or salad then a GIANT plate of food that had like 4 pieces of steak on it PLUS a desert item for around $15. It was worth every penny.< /text>

The ham was burned the pork was  extremely dry there was no mustard , there were two little pieces of pickle and no cheese . It tasted burned . It came with black bean soup that was very good .

An institution in Old Town. Terrific, authentic Cuban and Spanish food. Nice patio in the circle provides amazing people watching opportunities. The food is simple, unpretentious and delicious. Try the Roasted Pork, Ropa Vieja, and the old standby,  Cuban Sandwich.</review>

Great food, good cultural experience, good location. Doesn't have own parking, public parking available but not close to restaurant. Place is a little tight, ambience lacking, but you go there for the food and experience.< /review>

I've eaten at Felix's for thirty years. It remains a very consistent restaurant, and one where the locals eat. A nice selection of meat, fish and chicken Cuban cuisine. Most meals begin about $13. For that one gets a hearty bowl of soup, or small salad, bread, the entree and one of three desserts. I like the plain Chicken Cubano, a half a roasted bird, a big helping of delicious rice, black beans and plantains. If you like a warm green sauce ask for it on the side. My wife enjoys the rice and chicken with vegetables. I do not eat meat, however traditional pork and beef dishes are plentiful on the menu. I like to pay for a slice of their homemade chocolate cake and then take home the dessert which comes with the meal for a snack the next day. Enjoy your meal with a drink of wine or a beer.

Try the breakfasts, many of which come with either a Tostada Latina, two slices of batter cooked french bread with a guava puree between, or the Fritter, a sort of cooked pastry ball with a sweet sauce. Most breakfasts are between $10 and $14. You can eat well for $10. Most breakfasts also include a small juice.

Service is good, people are nice and helpful. It's located in the Orange Circle. Parking is more easily found beyond the circle in several adjoining parking lots.

Try Felix's once and you'll likely return.<//review>

Staff here provides a very fast and friendly service. I have had only one plate on two visits and it remained consistently delicious. Recommend this to anyone who wants to eat Cuban/Spanish style food.</review>

I want to rate this higher for having such a nice atmosphere with the outdoor seating in the Circle, but after getting a taste for Cuban food in Florida I have to say the food here overall is bland. Not bad, just not what I came know and love before.<//text>

Little drizzly but great day to visit the Orange circle and have breakfast at Felixs. We each ordered omelettes and split to sample I had shrimp and crab my friend had chorizo. Both excellent. And service was wonderful. Had been for lunch but not breakfast but proved to be just as good!< /review>

We got vanilla late that tasted like out of a can instead of Cafe con leche... We expected a true Cuban coffee. Not a traditional Cuban Mojo but rather an american dressing. Walked out semi-satisfied. Their Bread Pudding with Pineapple and Raisins was delicious.< /Review>

Some of my in-laws immigrated from Cuba, when we are meeting somewhere and want authentic Cuban cuisine, this is where we go.  Always reliably good.< /Text>

Although this is a Cuban restaurant, it comes very close to my Moms' home cooking which is Puerto Rican cooking. I usually  get pierna de puerco. Dessert is included & there's usually enough leftovers for the next day. I usually opt for the hommade soup of the day no matter how hot it is outside.
I celebrate my birthday here almost every year! Excellent customer service!</review>< Rate>

<review>The food is amazing here! The red bean soup that came with my meal was absolutely delicious. The bowl wasn't big enougH!! I could have ordered more, but i knew greay things would be xoming ahead based off of hoq that soup tasted. This place definitely did not disappoint. I can't wait to go back!!</review>< pictures>

If you like cuban cuisine this might be a good place. It was crowded (which is a good sign)

Did not go inside, but that was mostly due to the cold temperatures outside and everyone was in there trying to get away from the cold air.
So we had to settle with outside and the heat lamps of which there were too few and not in good placement.

But if you like Spanish cuisine, im not so sure this is the one for you. My preference is PAELLA, I really know what works and what doesn't. The Paella (Valencia) in particular did not even come near my standards or even what is the standard to expect.

I know there are a lot of variations but this just was let me simply say this... NO!

The rice was more of a soggy mess, and was way too much. It overwhelmed the seafood and there was no socrate or socarrat. Speaking of seafood, (only one mussel), no clams (that I could make out), the shrimp was good (4), a few squid (no tentacles) and the fish was so mashed I could not find any decent pieces, the sausage (was more of a chorizo) had no business in there)

So if you like Paella don't eat that here, anything else perhaps but I will seek my dining in the downtown city of orange elsewhere and my Paella at other places I have been.</text>

This is a typical cafeteria style Cuban restaurant, the prices are fair and the food is fairly good.

On my last visit I was disappointed, I decided to try their paella, but found out that instead of using "imported spanish chorizo" like it is stated in their menu, they are using cheaper Mexican chorizo which is like night and day.

I mentioned this to the owner and he did not seem like he was going to lose any sleep over it, however he did ask if I wanted a different plate. It is a shame, a good paella deserves good Spanish chorizo.<//text>

If you like cuban cuisine this might be a good place. It was crowded (which is a good sign)

Did not go inside, but that was mostly due to the cold temperatures outside and everyone was in there trying to get away from the cold air.
So we had to settle with outside and the heat lamps of which there were too few and not in good placement.

But if you like Spanish cuisine, im not so sure this is the one for you. My preference is PAELLA, I really know what works and what doesn't. The Paella (Valencia) in particular did not even come near my standards or even what is the standard to expect.

I know there are a lot of variations but this just was let me simply say this... NO!

The rice was more of a soggy mess, and was way too much. It overwhelmed the seafood and there was no socrate or socarrat. Speaking of seafood, (only one mussel), no clams (that I could make out), the shrimp was good (4), a few squid (no tentacles) and the fish was so mashed I could not find any decent pieces, the sausage (was more of a chorizo) had no business in there)

So if you like Paella don't eat that here, anything else perhaps but I will seek my dining in the downtown city of orange elsewhere and my Paella at other places I have been.<//review>
