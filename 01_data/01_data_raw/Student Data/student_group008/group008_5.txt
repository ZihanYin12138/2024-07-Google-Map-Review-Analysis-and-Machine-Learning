Excellent service from stylist there. Fast and friendly.Good value and happy with outcome. The first review but did return a week later and sadly a very bad experience .Had dropped in early and was advised to return 3 hrs later I did and still waited 15 min and then was quoted a 100 percent increase in the service I had received the first time.
Will not go back.</text>

You are encouraged to make a reservation although they do take walk-ins. The products are great and the service is good, especially if you have your hair colored or coifed by Ashley.</Review>

Great job and great haircut. I went in about 12:40 and got an appointment at 1:00. Marque was wonderful in getting me in and out with a very nice hair cut. My wife loved the haircut when I got home. I would highly recommend Marque at Supercuts.<//text>

I showed her a picture of what I liked since I can't describe haircuts very well and she gave me exactly what I wanted! I was in and out in no time, and for a great price, even though the cut looked like expensive quality! Definitely recommend for anyone needing a reliable haircut and they don't want to pay some outrageous salon price! I plan on going back.< /review>< pictures>

I got one of the worst haircuts I've had in my life here. The asian lady who cut my hair had no idea what I was asking for, and I was told "this is not how we do it in supercuts "!! Well now I can see how they do it and it's absolutely horrible.</review>

Naomi cuts my hair and always does an excellent job. I have wavy hair that looks horrible if not cut properly; I never look horrible with Naomi rockinhears. She is also the kindest, friendliest and most considerate person you will ever meet. The entire staff are super people who will have you looking sharp when you walk out.<//review>

I had a horrible experience at this place and I decided to not get my hair done there. Woman was nasty , mean, rude, and not empathetic at all about my situation. I was late, but I explained to her I could not find parking and could not locate the parking lot. I am at another Supercuts now. They were even nicer and much more helpful in the phone. Parker had a great phone presence. Do not go there.<//review>

the lady I had said no to everything I asked in a haircut. she said it wouldn't work with my hair- I had asked for side bangs, layers and she just made up an excuse. Lazy hairdresser- I don't recommend if you're a girl with thick hair. they'll be to lazy to make it look nice< /text>

Their prices just went up again, so its a good $20 bucks for just a normal trim with tip.  But when you live downtown and need a cut every couple of months, its the usual spot.  Be sure to call before hand and put in your name to gauge the wait time, then you can manage your window shopping on State Street and Blender's fruit smoothie shop next door. When its summer tourist season there may be a long wait, this is not a locals only joint.</text>

i got my hair cut from this place. i walked in and a mid-aged, fairly stocky/overweight mexican lady is the one who attended to my hair cut. don't get your haircut from her. i am a male with straight blond short hair. i told her to make it just short enough to spike a little bit. the normal male hair cut. to do a 2 on the sides and a 3 on the top and if it still needed to be cut from there, so be it.  she completely screwed it up. some areas were longer than others and it didn't look good at all. i don't know how you can screw up with just using the buzzer. it was $15 dollars. I went in a couple days later and told them the situation. I had to pay again. Never going here again.<//Text>

My stylist was obviously very inexperienced, awkward, even forgot to put the black drape over me before she started hacking away at my hair. Took forever and got poor result.<//text>

I went this week for a haircut & specifically told the bleached blonde that I wanted my bangs to be straight across and cut to BELOW my eyebrows. When I opened my eyes after she had trimmed them I found them to be crooked, above my eyebrows and LAYERED. Also, she wouldn't trim the sides of my bangs although I asked her to because she felt that I should grow that part out. NEVER again, my hair looks terrible! Good thing that hair grows quickly and the bangs will be better in a few weeks. Bad thing is that I feel like I look stupid for the next 2-3 weeks while the bangs get enough length to not stick straight up like alfalfa! Avoid her if you want something specific, she will do what she wants, it is totally not okay. Also, this is not Jason posting, it's his wife, can't remember my password!< /Text>

<text>Never again. I specifically asked the Asian stylist to make my hair a "V" in the back first bangs were way to short, no "V" . Horrible. She had no clue.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

It's small & people pull in all different ways. When it's busy it can be quite frustrating. Other than that it's clean & the employees are helpful.< /text>

<text>Good and clean. The drinks are very cold, which makes this ARCO stand out, cause most have barely chilled drinks and that realy bothers me. That's why I give this place 5 stars. And the squiji is clean and new. Thank you ARCO, for remembering the little things. It makes the experience that much better. And also, the staff are very polite and helpful. We needed directions, and they pointed us in the right direction,  which is rare to help a stranger out theese days. There was no trash in the driveway,  I was real glad I found this gem of a gas station. Once again, thank you ARCO.</text></record>

<text>This Arco like most has good prices, but this one is a notch above. It's neat and clean, including the restroom. They have all the amenities possible for a small place. But most of all the staff is great. I go out of my way to get my gas there whenever possible.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

This place is almost always a line at this ARCO. It feels like getting gas at Costco. It is conveniently located in a safe area. We like that the windshield brush buckets are relatively clean compared to other gas stations.< /text>

< Review>
The best gas station ⛽️ I’ve ever been to ! Great service , the owner is the nicest person. They don’t believe in charging in air. The bathroom is the cleanest gas station bathroom I’ve ever used. The water for the windows are always clean . Good place overall.</Review>

<Review>The station is clean and the employees are very friendly. I don’t feel unsafe when purchasing fuel late at night because it is very bright. The pumps are quick and there’s no confusion when it comes to the card readers.</Review>< pics>

Doesn't take credit so they can charge you to use a debit. Also the attendant can't be bothered to get off her phone< /text>

This ARCO gas station is the lowest priced in the area. That includes regular, midrange, and premium. You may pay with credit/debit cards or cash. Several pumps so the wait is generally not to long.</Text>

My FAV place to pitch my chair & read. Close to stairway to the street, the restrooms( which R pretty new w/ soap & water to wash up), & playground for little ones. Short walk to Oceanside pier. Rocky to get down to the water though, but doable.< /Review>

I love to come here and slack line. The grassy area is rarely overpopulated (save maybe the weekends), perfect area to set up a hammock and have a little BBQ with friends. Highly suggest checking this spot out.
If you see me out there on my slack line, come say hi!<//text>

I have been going to this restaurant since they opened. The staff is friendly and they're fast at making the food and getting it to you. It's one of the few restaurants in the area that has good Mexican food</Review>

<text>Came here for the reviews. I was not disappointed I got the 3 taco plate with refried beans and rice and it was probably the best I have had in the bay area. I have tried close to 50 restaurants and trucks in the bay. The service is not that good. I couldn't get the waiter to refill my cup of water no matter what I tried. He just seemed more content on cleaning tables and talking to guests, than tending to the only table that was currently eating which was just me. Other than that go here for authentic Mexican food. I ordered pastor tacos which were cooked perfect with a bit of crispy and tons of flavor. Will definitely be coming back to eat on the regular. I just know next time to not pay first so I can decide if I want to tip.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x808f910e3a92a53b:0x875f75df49e80ad3< /GmapID></record>

My favorite local taqueria. Delicious food with fast, friendly service and reasonable prices. My favorite dish is their carnitas dinner (under the tropical platters section). Their sopes are really good, too. The Chile relleno was OK, but a bit bland the time I had it. Everything else has been fantastic.</review>

< Review>
Update only to say we keep coming back here and are always happy that we did  this place is outstanding!

I just love this place! From the high quality of the seafood and the size of the portions to the staff who work there.

Not so easy to see from the street to keep aware but it does have a parking lot shared with a couple of other stores in the strip, I've seen it quite full but haven't had a problem finding a spot to park.

Look to the walls for pictures from the menu, I like choosing by look so I try new things. One of the new things is their Nachos Marinos, my favorite and what I have every other time I am there.

My father, who really appreciates hot good, ordered a dish and asked for hot - the waiter warned us that it would be hot - and it was. My father loved every minute of it! Said it was a proper hot and that it started warm but built as he ate. My dad can be picky and he was happy, I expect he'll be visiting on his own.< /Review>

I always come here for the taco special plate. It comes with 3 tacos (meat,onions,cilantro,salsa) with rice and beans for REAL cheap! But it's how good their food is that keeps this place in business while others have come and gone. There are a LOT of choices in this area for food, but Mar Y Tierra is easily one of the best around the East Bay.</text>

Quesadilla was top notch, the fish was tasty but a little overcooked and hence a bit dry. Otherwise delicious food - nice down home atmosphere.< /Review>

<Rate>3</Rate><review>Was driving Uber in Hayward and decided to find the nearest Taqueria to get a veggie burrito. Checked out their website which listed the burrito for $6.50. Went to the restaurant. The owner came up with a total of $9.31. Asked him how much the burrito was. He replied $8.50. Told him their website listed $6.50. He said he doesn't use the website but do need to update it.< /review>< Pictures>

<text>Iv been eating here since they day they opened. Iv had almost everything on the menu there is not a single bad dish. A few of my favorites are the #4 especial 3 tacos and the #11 pechuga flameada and let’s not forget the #8 wet burrito the enchilada sauce is to die for. I eat here 3 times a week for sure.

Maybe some of the folks with bad review just do t have the taste of ones who like it so well.. Not all restaurants can satisfy every patron. All eaterys have some kind complaints. Wont stop me from.going.</Text>< pictures>

For many years I've gone to this place 2-3 times a week and most of the time I would pick up 3-4 order for co workers... Under the new management it dropped from my favorite places to eat! Customer service not polite, specially the man waiter..food not so great below average for me..over priced compare to previous owner prices. No I'm not coming again..< /review>

Love Love Love this spot. My boyfriend and I eat here all the time, prices are great portions are great, service is great. There have been times when we went 2ce in one day. I love the al pastor, grilled chicken and the shrimp tostadas(for the low tho) they also have really fat shrimp plates. I like the garlic shrimp, but you have to peel the shells. The diablo shrimp come peeled already.  Oh the chips and salsa smack hard as well. I’ve never had a bad experience here< /Text>

< Review>
This food is BOMB! Man, you have no idea how excited I was to bump into this place coming from out of town (Fresno). The food is so flavorful and delicious! I got the tostada de camaron and it was DELICIOUS! My husband got the super quesadilla de asada and i ate half and it was delicious. Not greasy like other places. My son had the asada tacos and the meat is in big chunks and very well seasoned. Definitely hitting this place up everytime I am in town. Must go! They also have great customer service amd when I got my food to go, they gave us chips and salsa. Also, the prices are super cheap. Made me feel skeptical at first like they were going to skimp out on my food lol 😂😂. Not the case.<//Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) With all due respect but it was not my taste the toast of ceviche that I ordered one because they had cream or mayonnaise I do not know why it did not taste the ceviche and another that everything was super chopped as if they wanted to save the vegetables and the seafood hahaha I turned my stomach also a life wing in glass that was cocktail type haha ​​omg pure onion did not think anything of flavor about two shrimps, one or two oysters and 5 pieces of octopus jiji had no red tomato or anything simply onion and coriander exaggeratedly chopped that seemed not to be pure water with onion and some seafood, but I understand that tastes are broken genres and I can not say that all this bad is simply the worst thing eaten so far, I hope the owner can be aware of what what they serve and how they serve it ....

(Original)
Con todo respeto pero no fue de mi gusto las tostadas de ceviche que pedí una porque tenían crema o mayonesa no se otra por que no tenía ni sabor el ceviche y otra que todo estaba súper picado como si quisieran ahorrarse los vegetales y el marisco jajaja se me revolvió mi estómago también un vuelve ala vida en vaso que era tipo cóctel jaja omg pura cebolla no lo creía nada de sabor unos dos camaroncitos,uno o dos ostiones y 5 pedazos de pulpo jiji no tenía tomate rojo ni nada simplemente cebolla y cilantro exageradamente picado que igual parecía no se pura agua con cebolla y algunos mariscos,pero yo comprendo que en gustos se rompen géneros y no puedo decir que todo este mal simplemente es lo peor que e comido hasta ahora,ojalá el dueño pueda estar al tanto de lo que sirven y como lo sirven....</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrtCPyodluc-uRiT7-UWSgnKEZIGJNE7cJmXM5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoHO6xMpM_lEW892GQDi3Gq2Pl9pHyvM8LB0Mt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

< Review>
Came in to get a oil change and when I got out of the vehicle I was told to stay in the vehicle. I told him Its 106 degrees outside I'm not staying in the vehicle. He was extremely rude and said if I dont like it to leave. These guys are unprofessional.  Take your business to speedee, at least they are appreciative and much more professional. Only reason why I came here was spee Dee had quite a lot of people today.I told him to shut my hood I'll take my business somewhere else and I did.</Review>

<text>The oil change i had here was super efficient. I was in and it in 20 minutes from the time i pulled into the driveway until they were done changing the oil, topping off my fluids, and changing my windshield wipers. The employees are very friendly and attentive.< /text><Response>None<//Response><name>Dr R<//name>< UserId.>

Best place for Oil change, especially if you don't want to sit around for hours waiting for an oil change. These guys are quick and you don't even leave your car! You pull up, stay in your car and they do the oil change, just like that! Love it!<//text>

<Text>I've been going here for years. It's affordable, although not the cheapest in Tracy- what brings me back is that it's really fast, and I don't have to spend an hour waiting for an oil change. They don't try to con you into buying other products or services either, so props to them for that. They always show the dip stick after changing it to show that it's topped off.<//Text>< pictures>

<time>1555114385584< /time><rate>5</rate><Review>Every auto shop I go to wether in the bay or the valley tries to overcharge me or pushes for services I don't need. In a time when it seems like everyone tries to get over I have learned to take my vehicles to a shop for one or two small things before going for big jobs to see if a shop can be trusted. 99.99% of the time the answer is no but at Super lube plus on 11th I never have to worry about that. It's quality service every single time. They will recommend something if it needs done but not push for it and they always go the extra mile. I couldn't be happier with an automechanic shop if I tried, because I have and there is no other shop I trust like this one. I can't speak for the other locations but I've tried every auto shop in Tracy (quite a few in San jose) and this the only one I use.< /Review>< Pictures>

Ive been coming here for almost 7 years, if you want a fast oilchange, done well, at a fair price, by all means, come here, if youre into getting things done first thing in the morning, dont, because over the last year they have started showing up later and later. Ive been in their parkinglot for 30min, they "opened" 20min ago, but again, no one is here. This is the 3rd time in a row. I drive here from manteca, and as much as i want to continue coming here, i probably wont because of this.</text>

Outstanding customer service.
Normally use SpeeDee Oil change in Tracy but on this day wait was to long, on way home saw SuperLube and pulled in, had me in and out in minimum time. Customer service is friendly and professional, cost was much better than other places (I have a Hemi which uses 10 qts of oil). I will be using them from now on and highly recommend to others<//Text>

<text>This is by far the worst dentist I have ever went to. I had to wait 50 minutes before I got seated down and seen by a dental assistant. I went for an emergency visit and got the dentist to just tell me I need to get 2 wisdom teeth pulled because I had extreme teeth pain. I cannot even chew on that side of my mouth. I have to wait 30-40 days for them to get approval from my insurance to pay for my extractions. Basically I have to wait 2 months in order to get my teeth pulled out. This is an extremely long wait. I went to the pharmacist and got some amoxocillin due to an oral thrush. I do not recommend this office to anyone. The office is very old.<//text>< gmap_id>

The doctor was great very friendly and quick. It is an out dated facility, old equipment, new floors. The bathroom is DISGUSTING and its downstairs so its shared by the building but im assuming no one cleans it.. So I waited 60 mins for an appointment that was set up in December. It was at 11 but I was seen at 12 and done by 12:20, I presume they set up many people within the hour because 5 people had gone with the 11 am hour, but not me. The front desk people aren't necessarily friendly, but they answer any questions or concerns. I would go back to this facility based on the treatment I recieved from the dentist.<//review>

The dentist was quite rude and barely cleaned my teeth. I've been going here for 5-6 years and he still doesn't remember me everytime I walk in. He gives no description as to why I need certain procedures; Like needing braces? All he said I needed braces but gave me no reason, my teeth are straight so I'm confused. I've been needing a crown but they always get the wrong size for my teeth, 5 times this has happened. I'm tired of them wasting my time.
Not to mention the place smelled bad and I'm sure they don't clean their tools correctly.
No joke I think I caught Covid from this place, PLEASE don't go.<//Text>

I’ve had the VERY BEST experience going to this dental firm from the very first day! No judgement, no pressure, no over-the-top sales tactics – just honest to goodness, kind staff and friendly dentists. They move quickly, but efficiently.

EXCELLENT office, staff, and dentists!

I will continue to go here for life!

And they did a brilliant job on my new crowns!</Text>

Do not go to this place ever for anything. If you are referred ask for another one. I went to this place because I had a tooth infection that has the whole side of my face hot, swollen, red, tooth bleeding and gums swollen and the only thing I asked for was antibiotics and was refused. Yes they refused to treat me and prescribe medication. The healthcare representative thought that the symptoms that I gave her over the phone was severe enough to required me going to the emergency room. I don't know why a dentist would schedule you an appointment just to go all the way down there to REFUSE treatment. If you value your life and time DO NOT use this place.< /review>

The Dentist at Capital Family Dental gave me my confidence back by putting an amazing looking filling in my front tooth. Medi-cal denied my root canal at another office and I was ashamed to smile especially at work. My old office had  a 4 month wait for filling appts, so I finally switched office's and 2 days later I was sitting in capital family dentals chair getting all my work done. I  literally can not say enough good things about this office and Dr. I literally could not stop the tears from rolling down my face after seeing my new smile just after fillings. Please don't listen to the negatives.< /Text>

I have been going to this dentist for a year, I am having multiple crowns done.  Dr. Ghobashy does wonderful work and all my crowns look completely natural.  The lab they use is excellent and has the work done in a timely manner.  Dr. Ghobashy is very busy but he takes time to perform the work correctly and professionally.  He has a full staff and very modern equipment to accomplish his work.   I am spending quite a bit of money here as I need approximately 20 crowns, I have complete confidence in the work done at this office.</Review>

If you have Medi-Cal dental and are considering this place PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW ABOUT DENTIST AYMAN GHOBASHY AND DON’T GO. First I’ll say, I gave this place two chances because we all make mistakes and I thought he may have had a bad day the first time....and I really regret it now because he’s just a horrible provider. He has bad bedside manner and he barely does anything for your teeth.

I got there at 8 am and was not seen until 8:45. I tried to explain to him that I would like a deeper cleaning because the year before I felt he spent a few minutes on my teeth and he did not manually clean. He proceeded to tell me that manual cleaning is not routine (I have never in my life been to a dentist that does not manually clean first) and that my teeth don’t need it because they are clean enough. Then he told me if I don’t like it I can go somewhere else. Well, of course I will! But not before I warn the whole world about your disgraceful practice Mr. Ghobashy.

He started to clean my teeth very quickly and poking my gums a lot along the way. After about 2 minutes (not exaggerating at all here) he says “you have a small cavity on the upper left, book her a filling appointment”...where do I begin? He just tells me my teeth don’t need deep cleaning yet here I am sitting with a cavity...and no...I absolutely will not get my teeth touched by this man again. I would rather pay $600 for a tooth filling out of pocket than see this joke of a dentist again.

Will not be going back. I hope all you Medi-Cal dental folks out there take heed and think twice. I really don’t think this guy realizes how much people rely on honest reviews anymore. So for the love of your precious teeth take HIS OWN advice and “find another dentist”!!!!< /Text>

I have the worst dental anxiety. I dreaded my extraction for 2 weeks. Went in the front staff was okay. The dental assistants were kind and patient. Dr. Shadi Boutros was amazing. He didn't just jump behind me sit down and ask questions. He presented and introduced himself. No judgement no criticism. Calmed me and assured me that I was gonna be fine. Literally within 5 mins. I'm out the door. I can't thank you all enough! Overall amazing!</review>

The clinic itself looks nice but front desk helper is not very perfessional at all.Very hard to reach them and set appointment. I left a voicemail and one week went by with no call back. The doctor were great! Everything from the time waiting to when finish was 1 hr.</Review>

10/26/18 I'am so thankful, and happy that I decided to come here ,I had been dealing with a bad tooth for 8 months and have been getting the run around from previous dentist just to pull out my molar tooth, I recommend this place for their service, the doctor was amazing he pulled my tooth within 5-7 mins while being awake , I also give thanks to the doctor seeing that there was a bad car accident on my way to this appointment , witch took a 45 min delay in my appointment and I almost thought I was going to have to reschedule and not get the process done, but they decided to still see me anyway and took care of me !!! Thank you Capital Family Center I will send people to your company</text>

I made an appointment for my 2 year old daughter 2 weeks ago which was scheduled today 9/15. When I called to confirm since I never got a confirmation call I was told her appointment was Monday (today is Thursday) - no, it wasn't. All of the appointments in our house are noted but they were able to fit us in today at the same time, right. I was referred this office from my daughters medical insurance company and was told they see children from ages 0-7. I get there and there are no toys but magazines and TV (which is convenient for the adults) which made me question how often kids come to this office. We get put in a room and the dental assistant (appeared Filipino) was kind and very sweet although seemed very new as if this was her first day. The doctor comes in and I explain this is my daughters first time seeing a dentist and she is nervous, nervous to the point she doesn't want to open her mouth. She doesn't even look at the dentist and I'm trying to reassure her she is okay he needs to look at her teeth. He says "You look pretty like a barbie doll now open" and she doesn't so he says "You know what? I have other patients I don't have time for this" and walks out. I thought he was joking.
He went to his other patient and never returned. I had to ask if they were serious and if that's how they conduct their business. How rude and disrespectful and he's lucky my daughters father was not present.
The 3/4 front desk/dental assistants came out to check on the crying baby and the livid mother and apologized. They referred us to a more "child friendly" dentistry and were genuinely sweet.

"DDS Ayman Ghobashy" is unprofessional, rude, and disrespectful. I wouldn't pay him to work with my child nor work on her teeth. I do not recommend him to anyone. He's not personable at all and was insanely disrespectful.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x809ad094c15d7347:0xe7c6e9fcc6f4ca31< /GmapID></record>

<text>HORRIBLE! They make you wait at least 2 hours even if you have an appointment. The dentist was very unprofessional and rude, and it’s obvious that he doesn’t care about each one of his patients. He is always rushing, it seems like he just wants to get you in and out of there. He hurt my gums multiple times during a teeth cleaning. His assistant was clueless, she didn’t know what she was doing at all. Don’t go here. Worst service ever< /text></record>

This place really needs to be shut down. I have never had worst service anywhere else. Staff acts nice, but service all-around is very unprofessional. Had an apt. At 11AM. Waited until 4PM. Still not seen after that. Staff lies to patients saying its a 30 minutw wait when they ask. They also don’t tell patients they won’t be seen on time, or even remotely clise to it. Worst staff ever. Wait is longer than a bad day at the DMV and the actual dental service is mediocre at best. They really need to be shut down. They have just been writing medication prescriptions left and right without really treating patients. Not a good look.< /text>

The wait time was okay but the dental surgeon was horrible I went in to get my 2 bottom wisdom teeth extracted first they tell me they were only going to take out 1 tooth because it seemed my dentist probably made a mistake on the paper work by saying to take out  both(she didnt because I remember her clearly saying she was going to put down on the referral to take out all 4 wisdom teeth so they won't bother me in the future) so the dental surgeon comes in shoots me with the numbing and tells me to wait a while for it to fully numb. When he comes back in he puts a block type of thing on the other side and tells me to bite down on it. So he begins to poke around and lift the tooth and i start to feel some pain then he starts pulling and tuging and it begins to hurt more so i start grunting to let him know I'm feeling pain all he says is "i know i know" and pulls harder and im grunting, crying and trying not to squirm it felt like if he was forcing me down and yanking out my tooth not caring that I was in complete pain once he takes it out he puts gauze on the open wound( he didn't stitch it closed) and says good bye. While the dental assistant was giving me the instructions I need to follow I was trying to get myself together because I was bawling my eyes out I was in so much pain and was traumatized by the whole experience it felt as if I was tortured. I see why people do not like going to the dentist. This was hands down the worst dental experience I've ever had. Oh and they only prescribed me ibuprofen and Tylenol for my pain 😒 multiple people thought I was joking about them giving me those pills for my pain they said they were crazy for not prescribing me something stronger.</Text>

I have yet to make it in to the office because they never return my calls. The referral my insurance sent was labeled an emergency yet they are impossible to get ahold of. This is day three of calling and I have left 4 messages a day! Im definitely not excited about having work done at this office! Im just going to drive down to the office because apparently thats what it takes!!!</review>

Never again ‼️ The dentist is in a rush and very aggressive.  They have some cheap numbing medicine. Place looks stuck in 1970s. Overall bad experience.< /text>

From my very first contact, I received a very courteous and professional service. It is refreshing to know that this organization knows the importance of good customer service.< /text>

Couldn't even get an appointment after a week of calling and not getting a call back. When they finally answered they hung up on me twice. RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL.<//review>

<review>Nice, friendly, and quick service. They don't have fountain sodas, but they do have a large variety of canned and bottled drinks. I love that it definitely has a mom & pop vibe when you go in.  Go on Friday and get their BBQ tri-tip sandwich!</review>< pictures>

If you order online they charge a $2 processing fee. Also, if you order for curbside delivery, they don’t actually bring your order outside.< /Text>

<review>I think you have to visit another Sandwich Spot location to appreciate the poor quality at this location. I have visited this one four or five times, and each time the staff all look miserable, unhappy, and like they wish they were ANYWHERE else. Other locations I've visited have staff that appear to genuinely love sandwiches and their jobs. I can no longer assume every time I go into this one that they are just having an off day. Today, there was only one other customer in there and my order was still wrong. The only saving grace is that the food is still pretty decent when they get it right.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1532038374232, 'text': 'I am really really sorry to hear about it.i will make sure I will talk to my employees about it.usually their pretty with customer service as you can see on our Yelp reviews.

<Review>Have you ever bit into a sandwich and it just made your day better, well this place will do it for you. I’m vegetarian and I can’t really tell you about there meat sandwiches but my number 10 veggie sandwich is always always super fresh and made perfect. The bread alone is the freshest I’ve ever had and the staff is super friendly, clean, and make the tastiest neatest sandwich. I’ve been to other locations and this one is the one that never disappoints me.<//Review>< Pictures>

Great sandwich place. They have a vegetarian option  which is great. The staff isn't the friendliest, but they are quick and always get my order right. The sandwiches are pretty big, sometimes you have to wait for certain breads (extra 5 or so minutes) but always worth the wait for sourdough.< /text>

In addition I had to ask for my change because the cashier only gave me coins back from a $20 and all I ordered was one sandwich. When the cashier handed me the $10 it looked fake to me. I had to ask for two 5's instead.  I have been to this location a few times and never had a problem before. It has been a while however and it seems it may be under new management or ownership? I do not believe I will return. Sorry.< /Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Unorganized messy and to top it off the staff was extremely rude! Went in around 2pm manger seemed irritated. I asked what bread was the freshest. She told me all of them. As she began to make the sandwich a co worker  went in the oven and took out fresh bread rolls. When I asked if I could get the fresher bread. She refused me and started to make a scene. I could understand if she had put everything on the sandwich and it was wrapped but that wasn't the case  . I was dissatisfied with the way things where handled I hope your experience is more pleasant</Review>

<Text>Some of the best sandwiches I've ever had and at a reasonable price. Plus genuine and positive customer service. If you like spicy, always go with ghost pepper cheese.<//Text>< username>

< Review>
I remember coming in here one eveneing and amazed by the variety they have here on the menu. I think I got a number five called the, "night hawk." The meat was nice and savory. A nice delight of juice with every bite. Cheese game was proper, but what was even more proper was the attitiude of the staff. I am intrested in trying out more of there menu. Come take a bite at the Sandwhich Spot!< /Review>

Working in the area and came here for lunch. Best tri tip sandwich I have had in a very long time. Subway is about to have some serious competition. To top it off, the great customer service provided is really the icing on the cake. You definitely have to try it when in the area.<//Review>

The workers really hustle to get orders done. The food is just ok, some items way better than others but all food is pretty messy. The place can really use a spurce up, dingy and a little grimy.< /Text>

Overall love the sandwich spot, however this location is smaller than the rest and is super packed during lunch. The quality of the sandwiches is still great. I docked a star because the service wasn't great, they got my order wrong and I had to wait around 20mins to order.</review>

<Review>I ordered a ruben. I love a good ruben. this is not. it is about 2/3 the size of any other ruben. the bread was toasted, but soft and soggy by the time I got to work with it 5 minutes away. disappointing. more wrapping than sandwich today.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>I ordered a veggie sandwich and when I got home it was basically just bread. The sandwich had like 4 sliced pickles, one tiny leaf of  lettuce folded in half and a few peppers. Not worth the almost $10 I paid for it.< /Text><username>Desirae<//username><rating>1<//rating><response>None< /response>< Time>

I spoke with the owner and she seems under the influence she couldn't comprehend what I was saying to her.< /text><date>1443636918647< /date><name>Bruce Napolitano</name></record></dataset><record>

Skimpy on meat and by far the worst sandwich spot. I like the sandwich spot but this location falls way short on quality compared to other locations< /text>

I am very happy with the work they did on my audi. It's very difficult to find a mechanic who is trustworthy and does great work. Well you can find that at First Class Auto! I'll be sure to get all future repairs and up keep with them and will refer family and friends! Thanks to all at First Class Auto works,!!!< /text>

<review>I referred Alex to one of my friends who needed service on her Mercedes. She had a horrible experience with another local automotive repair company. I explained to her that Alex was not your typical mechanic. He and his staff are honest and reliable and would not try to upsell unnecessary services because she was a female. She took my recommendation and was pleasantly surprised by his service, care, and pricing. In fact, she now uses him exclusively for any repairs and service work.  I know I can trust Alex and his team and feel confident referring anyone who needs a reliable mechanic that provides great quality and service.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

< Review>
My car started to leak fluid, and my husband was able to figure out pretty quickly what the problem was. It was a bigger project than he wanted to tackle, so we took it to First Class Autoworks. We worked with Alex, and he was great. He diagnosed the problem to be the same as my husband (who is very skilled working on cars),  without us telling him what we thought the problem was. So many times people don't know if mechanics are being honest about what work needs to be completed, so it was comforting to know that Alex was an honest businessman. Alex and his team did a great job, he communicated regularly with me, and offered to shuttle me home while they were working on my car. Thank you, Alex!< /Review>

Alex is a true professional. My daughter needed a transmission flush and Alex answered his phone promptly, gave a very fair quote and was available to accomodate my daughter's schedule. He did an excellent job, gained a new client and I would refer all of my family, colleagues and friends to Alex for their car maintenance and repairs! Thank you Alex!!</Review>

Highly recommend! Best pricing! Initially I went to an auto shop near my house in HB and I didn’t feel comfortable with the high quote and customer service. I was referred to Alex at First Class AutoWorks in Fullerton by my sister in law.  At first I hesitated because of the distance but after speaking with Alex, they quoted me half the price as the HB shop!  They did the repairs on my Audi Q7 (steering wheel pump, spark plugs, ac/cabin filters, 60k miles service chk ) in one day, and washed my car too! These guys are the best and worth the drive!  Fair and honest!</Review>

My friend had suggested to try this place out.  I called to make an appointment and check prices.  Much better than going to Land Rover!! The person that I spoke to was very helpful and really nice.  When I got to my appointment with them I had been rushing around all morning and had my baby and toddler with me.  The babies were sleeping and the guy helping me said it was ok to leave them there and he could bring the computer out to us to check the car.  I was very grateful.  Parking was easy for me because I made an appointment early but looks as though it wouldn't be a problem later either. I was pleased that they work on many different luxury imported cars. They have a list online. The employee helping me was wonderful and didn't even wake the kids. He finished my car up in no time. Thank you so very much!!< /Text>

Alex is awesome! I found First Class Autoworks after my Mitsubishi dealer changed management and I no longer felt I was getting honest or reliable work. Alex is patient, knowledgeable, and honest about what work you actually need done. I always have a million questions and Alex never makes me feel like I'm a bother. He takes the time to explain even the most basic of auto care questions so I can keep my car in great shape. I have referred both family and friends to First Class & they were also very pleased with Alex's service and prices. It's a rarity to say you actually trust your car repair shop but I feel that Alex and First Class have earned that trust completely.<//Text>

HELP!" Lucky for us I found First Class Autoworks on the web. When I called and spoke to Alex I knew immediately that everything would turn out fine. Alex is extremely professional and a great communicator. We had my daughter's 2002 Volkswagen towed to the shop and Alex was able to diagnose the problem quickly. He kept us up to date with numerous phone calls explaining what he had found and what it would take to get it fixed, when the parts would arrive and when the car would be ready to pick up. The constant communication made the entire process so easy. I never had to wonder what was going on or if my daughter would make it home for Christmas. The repairs were top notch, the car runs great and we all had a very Merry Christmas together thanks to Alex and First Class Autoworks. What a blessing!!!!
Thank you so much Alex!

If you are in need of a great mechanic, look no further than First Class Autoworks.
Again, the name says it all. They truly are FIRST CLASS!!!!!!!!!!!!<//text>< pics>

Our car had a leak in the head gasket and also a tire pressure sensor that kept coming on, no matter what we did (it's a 2008 Nissan Altima).

The price for this major job was reasonable - especially compared to the other quotes we got from "less-skilled, less-reputable" facilities. It's been a few weeks and the car runs great.

They were the ONLY shop that was able to fix the tire pressure sensor, and that's been amazing. Now, if the tires do have a change in pressure, it will read correctly.

Alex and his Dad (and their dog, Bella) couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating. It was pleasurable to work with them If you're looking for a trustworthy shop to repair your car, this is it!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I have a older Toyota and have had to have several things taken care of  over the last several months. I appreciate how Alex explains things to me and always answers all my many questions. Having alot of repairs can be rather costly and stressful.  As a woman, I really need to feel comfortable and also feel I am getting the best work possible. First Class Autoworks does just that, a very professional shop that does great work and has wonderful customer service. I am rather disappointed they are not open on Saturdays but that is the only drawback for me.<//text>

Not necessarily the shops fault the work they did was fine however after taking it to a different shop they missed the main air leak that is apparently "quite apparent". Main issue I had is every time I was told I would get a call back in about an hour I would have to call again 2-3 hours later. Also they said that techs were on extensive test drives however when picking up my car there was maybe 10-20 more miles (not extensive in my opinion). Otherwise relatively decent experience. Also prices quoted on the phone never included labor.<//Review>< gmap_id>

< Review>
CROOK  I will be updating my review regarding my experience with this place. I'd think twice about giving them my business. Apparently cheat the customer, overcharge and sell them parts you don't actually replace is the business model here. I dropped off one of our work vans off last week to address the check engine light. We found two codes and told Alex prior to bringing the van what the two codes were. He calls me with an estimate of $3244.00. It was actually $3359.23 when I arrived. He stated I needed a new catalytic converter and sensors replaced. I acquiesced and approved as we need to get the vehicle smogged. When I picked the vehicle up just before entering the freeway the check engine light reappeared! I turned around and took the van back and asked "why did I just pay $3400, the check engine light is on!?" . I was told Alex slipped out, I sat and waited, when he returned he plugged in the code reader and showed me a code for the DEF heater. I reminded him once again, we already told him it was on!! I left the van yet again. Alex called late the following morning and stated this repair would be $1700! I refused and told him I will pick my van up. I ubered (for the 3rd time at a cost of $105 total) to retrieve my van. He asked what I planned to do about the DEF heater, I asked AGAIN for the return of my NOX sensors he claims he replaced, after an "oh, um.... the scrap guy came and picked them up just yesterday" I reminded him I requested my old parts back! You know, PER CALIFORNIA LAW! I digress, I told him his pricing is outrageous trying to charge me ANOTHER $1700 after getting paid $3400, my God I can buy a used car!!! I told him the OEM DEF filter online is $600 MAX, the def tank which I have removed before is held in with 4 bolts, it's a 45minute job!! Who the hell makes $1864 an hour!!! Apparently Alex. I know he gets them even cheaper. He goes on to feed me some line about "If it doesn't come in a Mercedes box" You are full of sh*t! Mercedes doesn't make the DEF heater, many of the OEM parts are Bosch. He claimed he would show me his "invoice" which I had already had it with my intelligence being insulted. I know how this works, and I am not interested in seeing a fake invoice which reflects a catalog price or suggested retail price. After the shuddering and repeated lines of bunk I'd ruminate this is common practice at First Class Ripoff Autoworks, where you cheat your customers. I will be updating this review and adding it online once finished. In the meantime I am waiting for a refund for the stolen funds, or I can simply sue this perfidious mechanic. Wouldn't be the first time I've caught a lying mechanic, sued them, won, and collected a judgment. B&P code 9884.9 (a) also requires a written estimate and authorization exceeding initial estimate, neither was provided. On the phone call where I approved the initial work I specified I wanted the old parts returned. When I asked for the nox sensors they claim they replaced $990 plus tax plus installation alex replied "oh, uh, the scrap guy picked them up". You scrapped MY parts, who gave you permission to scrap my parts. I reminded Alex I stated I wanted them back, you know, PER CALIFORNIA LAW! Per California Automotive Repair act 1974 The shop is required by law to return the parts to you only if you ask for them before the work is done.  Perhaps this is why Anthony quit working here</Review>

I didn't get the fix that I needed for my car to fix oil leak that cost over $2k. He suggested additional $1.4k to fix issues related to oil leak.

With that amount of money spent, I could of buy new engine and problem solved. Alex is great guy but fall short meeting my expectation to fix my car.

It's a complete waste of money for me and I can't put than I all ready put in.</Review>

I'm so glad this place is still open! Best ice cream in the Valley! Their food is delicious, especially the fries and burritos. Will be coming here more often. So sad that they closed the El Centro, and Calexico Foster's Freeze ): but super happy that this one is still in business! 🍟🍔🍦💕</review>

This place never disappoints. I always go for their ice cream. It's a bit pricey, but worth it. They never slack off on the ingredients. They also have good food. Love their fried burritos.< /text>

The girl working was rude and made me two taquitos that were sad with no cheese barely a smidgen and no sauce it's the first time I didn't like the food there. I've been going there for fifty years  I paid $23 for hamburgers fries sodas and taquitos. The only thing that was really good was the onion rings perfect. But her attitude was bad and I knew my food wouldn't be so good this time before I even got it</Text>

I used to lpooove lime slushees from Fosters. I went there while visiting Cali and they had all the flavors EXCEPT lime. So after seeing butterscotch covered cones in the window, I decided to get that instead. They didn't have that either. So I just got a chocolate dipped cone, paid and waited. When my order arrived, I got a chocolate milkshake because the dipping chocolate was chunky.< /text>

I asked no sweet, rose buckwheat milk tea with salted foam. It is too too sweet...... even though without any “sugar”.<//review>

<review>Finding the actual place is a little complicated, especially if you have never been to that mall. They do good drinks, and their staff is very friendly. While making drinks the staff play K-pop (Korean pop music) in the background.</review>< pictures>

fast and friendly service. the tea flavor here is pretty good. although one girl was drinking her own boba behind the counter and that doesnt seem too sanitary to me. comes out to a little over $5 for a drink.</review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>This was my first time as I tried Bubble Tea, one of my Tea enthusiast friend suggested me to try it. So what could have been better than trying one and only Rabbit brand Bubble tea in the San Jose.
During my visit to this area I ordered one of their popular Bubble tea and at the first sip I was amazed with the taste and quality of ingredients inside the sipper.
It was a completely Tea experience for me but really liked this newly concept Tea.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Text>I really liked this place!
The only other place I've been to or seen a Rabbit Rabbit was in Taiwan.

They have a nice selection of fresh drink options that range from traditional to more unique Asian flavours.

I got the Japanese buckwheat milk tea with real taro in the bottom, and it was very filling and tasty!
If I were ever in the area I would go here again.

They're located at a Kiosk on the top floor of the Westfield mall, and there always seemed to be a small line.</Text>< name>

Very fast service. The seals, cups, and straw combo was very cute and aesthetically pleasing. I got the tiramisu milk tea with 75% sweet and 50% ice. It was pretty good. Very tasty! Only problem I had was that I wish the cashier gave me more of a recommendation because I was obviously new to everything. I would definitely come back though!< /Text>

I do non-dairy and I like that they have good quality.  I like you can choose  sweetness level and the teas I have tried  are  have a good balance no to bitter or too light. .. I have tried other's at the mall and this is my favorite.</Text>

Cool place. I like it that it sells reusable straws.

But at least for the tea i ordered, nothing too special.</Review>

Bad service, I placed an order via Recipo app an hour ago, but the order wasn’t been able to deliver on time. Actually it was never been delivered and was still in store. So I called the store, however, the servant was very rude and hang off the phone. That’s the most terrrible experience I have.</text>

Make sure you pull up a picture of the menu on your phone so you're ready to order, as the menu is only in the front of the line and very small.

I ordered the Iron Buddha with pearls, which was a bit different than the usual pearls you get. These ones were white but with the texture of the regular black boba you get! It was super delicious.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Fast and friendly service. Also if you hate how ice tea has too much ice or is too/not enough sweet this is the place for you. You can select how much ice you want and how sweet the tea should be.<//Review>

<Date>1536677497292<//Date><rating>3</rating><Review>so super excited to try this place.  The last few times the line was too long so I didn't wait.  I tried the iron Buddha with pearls, 50% sweetness.  Was good but not amazing.  I liked the pearls better then other places but didn't love the non dairy creamer they use.  It just wasn't rich and creamy like some of the others have tried.  In short I would go there again but if there is a huge line its not worth the wait.</Review>< pictures>

I appreciate that you can choose your sweetness level and the amount of ice you want. My lychee green tea with boba was perfect- 0% sweet, 50% ice.  No line when we got there, so it was fast ordering and quick drink making.</review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>(Translated by Google) The shop is on the second floor of the shopping plaza, like a roadside stall. I ordered pearl milk tea, 25% sugar and de-icing. The milk tea is creamer milk tea. The taste is the same as that of a Taiwanese hand shake. The pearls are transparent and have a good taste. Overall it tastes good, but the price is slightly higher.

店舖在購物廣場的二樓，像是一個路邊的攤位。我點了珍珠奶茶，25%的糖跟去冰，奶茶是奶精奶茶，味道跟台灣手搖飲料的味道一樣，珍珠是透明的，口感不錯。整體來說味道不錯，只是價位稍高一點。</Text>< Pictures>

<review>I was referred to the school by a friend. I was very surprised at the level of service I received from the staff. Mario Santa was so clear and helpful in explaining the process and program. I definitely give him and the rest a two thumbs up for his professionalism. Can’t wait to celebrate this mile stone.<//review><user>105994784634309216383< /user></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Let’s just say the communication has been by far the best, Mario called me and was super helpful and encouraging. I started this process a few years ago but had to stop because of work. Mario has definitely helped me out and is super informative. I highly recommend Contractor State License School. Thanks for all the help!< /Text>< userid>

I cannot thank CSLS enough for the support they have provided through this whole process. If you guys need someone to be in your corner every step of the way ask Miguel Ponce he has been a gigantic help with his effective communication about each step in the process. Passed the exam on 4/12/21 and purchased a bond with them as well. I highly recommend if you guys are looking to get your license you use CSLS!

Thanks again Miguel!</text>

<review>I decided to enroll to this contractors school I’ve been wanting to attend awhile back. I spoke to a counselor name Mario. I had numerous questions to ask regarding the classes, payment options, certification, licensing, etc. He handled all my questions like a champ and I was pleased with the new information and all the answers I received. Mario took the time and effort answering all my concern and was very knowledgeable. I wouldn’t have had a pleasant experience with signing up with Contractors State License School if it wasn’t for the excellent customer service he provided me. Which was a major part of the process of deciding whether you’ve made the right decision or picked the right school. Mario helped me make that final leap. Thank you Mario!

Mario welcomed me into the office and not only went through every little detail of the process of pursuing my license, but answered the hundreds of questions I had to ask and also took the time to get to know me as an individual.

Couldn’t say anything bad even if I tried!
Mario walked me through all the steps and explained everything throughly. Couldn’t have asked for a better conversation/learning experience!
Thank You To Mario for making this a Great Experience!!
Andres the school consultant is AWESOME!!!!
He goes out of his ways to make it seem seem less! He takes all the stress out of paper work and talking to you. Very professional personality, I could see him excel in higher management to make this company even better than it already is.</text>

This school was highly recommended my neighbor.  I just called to ask a few questions and to get some information On their program.  I spoke with a gentleman named Mario who explained the entire process and answered all my questions.  Mario was patient and extremely knowledgable.  Because of him I enrolled on the spot.  I look forward to getting my contractors license.  Thanks!< /Review>

I am a 3rd gen plumber thrown into a bad situation as my father passed this year unexpectedly, and I needed to get my license on my own. Mario made it an incredibly simple process to get started and get
Me on my way. He listened to me ramble and answered all my questions. What a professional and top notch experience.</review>

I will have to say GREAT contractor education system.  This school is the  prefect choice for tradesman ready to becoming a contractor.  Haydee Ramirez who is the personal at the front desk, she did a wonderful job helping me organize my paper work and making sure I had everything I needed to be prepared for studying, and taking the exam.  I recommend you take the 3 month online test prep exam,  Part A,B,C, and D. evening classes, and the weekend classes that prep you write before the class.
Thanks so much Haydee  and Alex for you patients in helping me I know other students whom pass there exam will say the same.</Text>

Once you try reaching out to them good luck getting a response I signed up in June it’s now October and have yet to even take any online class or in person class. It’s not because of payment because they took full payment fast. Trust me on this safe some time and take your business some place else this place will take your money and turn there back on you. Avoid this place at all Cost.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

GREAT PLACE! Mario laid all the facts out for me...came in with questions in my mind but were answered before I could even ask. Mario is one who treats you as if you have known for a while. Left his office with excitement and eagerness to start school. Highly recommended<//Review>

The classes are informative, the study materials are excellent, and the crash course before the exam helped so much. The staff are very well informed and help you with every step of the way. Their ability to handle all the paperwork from incorporating your business to obtaining a bond is invaluable. Haydee is remarkable at her job and the rest of the staff is also superb.

This is the best contractor school before during and after licensing for any trade they offer. Even after three years of assisting the school and passing my exam they are still willing and HAVE HELPED me with questions and concerns I have had. I completely recommend the school 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻< /Review>

<text>I had initially called and spoke with Jerry wanting some questions answered. He was extremely helpful and I never felt pressured to sign up. When I did go into the school, Mario had helped me decide which program to purchase. I am very happy I had decided to go with this school, everyone has been nothing but helpful! Thanks again!!</text>< Pics>

I called and spoke to Mario. He was straight forward and got me set up quickly. I have been doing my research and knew what was involved already, but regardless felt real good about my experience after hanging up. Hopefully the rest of the process is as efficient as Mario was on the phone.<//Review>

It was good the treatment I had talk to Mario once about enrolling and I wasn’t so sure he didn’t rush you or pressure you to enroll. Came back the second time and did decide to start the program. And he explains step by step the process and what’s best for your future company. All in all great treatment.</review>

Haydee Ramirez has been helping me with adding a C-17 to my General B license. She's amazing. Always easy to reach and super helpful. She's honest about which products you need and if she doesn't know the answer right away, she get it quickly. They're very luck to have her.<//Review>

The extra studying material that the school in Orange had really helped me reinforce my knowledge passing my test. The crash preparation courses are taught by knowledgeable instructors who have had experience on the field. Heidi was a positive reinforcing factor to help me through the process earning my contractors license B.</text>

They helped me with all my Contractor needs. Took the classes, they help with sending the paperwork to the State. They make everything as easy as possible in order for you to succeed. They helped me by making it easy to sum it and take my tests. And also helped a lot with their classes. Highly recommend</Review>

If it was not for Haydee Ramirez I doubt I would have followed through with going to school. Haydee pays genuine attention to a individuals needs, questions and concerns. and goes beyond the call off duty to see that they are addressed. This of course reflects upon CSLS, in that the school has such a high caliber of employee. I'm now looking forward to the rest of the program and meeting the other staff of CSLS.

I went to the orientation in Orange, not knowing what to expect, a little confused with a lot of questions. Thanks to Haydee, with Contractor school in Orange, she explained the entire process, answered all my questions and made sure I had everything I needed to apply. She is truly so kind and sweet, it shows that she genuinely enjoys her job and what an awesome experience is was!< /text>

First time I walk in CSLS I found them to be knowledgeable and helpful.
There was Haydee in front and she answered all my questions.  Later she gave us students a brief lecture about the school and patiently answered all the questions in Spanish and English.
I had several questions regarding my work experience certified and she sat up an appointment to explain everything.
She seemed to be very knowledgeable in trade and law questions in the exam.
I would recommend this center and the staff.<//Text>

Mario didn’t tell me the holiday special didn’t cover the state application fee of $300.  I asked is there any other charges or fees? He said no.  I go to orientation and find out I need to pay another $300 to apply for my test.  And I also find out that if you have a bad driving record or any kind of a record the state can deny your application.   Non of the was asked or told to me!!   Not happy.  And Mario txt over and over for me to leave a good review because he gets rewarded on them.  So I did.  Them found all this out.  Which is why I edited my review!!  I will be trying to get my money back from this school.  They don’t tell you everything.   Just want you to sign up and give the cash!!!   Not cool</Review>

This is an awesome school if you’re looking to pursue getting your contractors license. Everything from the exam preparation to the crash courses they offer are all top notch. A big thank you to Haydee Ramirez, i must have called her a thousand times over the period of time from when i enrolled until I passed my exam and she always was willing to help me. She also took the time to help me with all the paperwork that I wasn’t sure how to fill out. Thank you Haydee! You made becoming a contractor a great experience for me and a big thank you to rest of the team there!< /Text>

Haydee, Alex, and Bill were all awesome!

They took care of all the confusing paper work while explaining all the steps as you progress forward. The only thing  you as a contract have to do is pass your trade exam! (Law and business will be taught to you at he school) They offer a lot of pre test and online test questions for trades, law and business quizzes (take advantage of that ASAP!). Overall, the journey might be hard and tough, but CSLB got your back! Especially when you have Haydee, Alex, and Bill by your side!< /Review>

<review>Dealing with the state is a joke. I choose this shcool because I knew they had the information needed to pass the state test. Only attended two classes didn't do a crash coarse. I studied myself from the material payed for and passed. Thank you ALEX straight up like I like my whiskey. Your the man you helped guided me through it all keep up the awesome work. Hadi I hope I spelled it right thank your for you patience with dealing with me from the beginning to pass amen.</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

She is very helpful and optimistic in the process of acquiring a Contractor's License. Immediately jumped on board, to make this possible, and lower the level of Anxiety, from this Journey...  She even helped Financially by cutting some numbers down and honoring others from a past attempt that time ran out on to no fault of CSLS. I am Looking forward to working through this process and acquiring a license, and the next steps to come in the future

Thank You Haydee....

God Bless You..<//Text>< pics>

This school is great! They have prepared me to become a licensed contractor. Haydee Ramirez was especially helpful when filling out the paperwork for the CSLB. Her smile alone is worth 5 stars! Thank you CSLS!< /review>

Would highly not recommend any CSLS at all the only aspect that covers  the exam from the state is the law part but good luck on the trade part as much of what you will be studying will not resemble what the state exam will ask would go to other schools for the trade exam<//review>

<text>Do not trust all the 5 stars,they deserve barely 1 star.We spoke to SEAN and asked if he could give us a deal for their all inclusive package ,after spending couple of days going back and forth he give us the deal that was already in their July online package.Do not waste your energy, time and money in here.there are plenty of other schools around.I don't trust them anymore since every time they change their words.
I left a message and send email to SEAN supervisor
MR.JAZ BESAGAR and he never respond back very disappointed and unprofessional management.<//text>< Pictures>

I recomend 100% this school!!. I went there, and Mario help me to enroll the class. He explained me all process and requirements. After that, Haydee guided  me through all steps such as scheduling clases, application form, and keep posting my dates for crash course, math review,  and taking test skill class. The professors were excellets. They have a lot experience, and they share their personal knowledge with the students making us feel more confident. The result, was great as expected because all excellent guidance from this school. I did it!!!. Thank you!!!< /text>

<Review>I went to Csls in the city of Orange to get my contractor license for general B. I passed my exam after couple of times . All the team members were helpful especially Haydee (the student administrative) was helpful in every step of the way.She has the best customer service and she is there for you to help with all your questions and with all your application process. She has a positive attitude and she keeps encouraging the students to keep trying and not give up and give them a positive morale .It was a great experience, and I recommend Csls of Orange to everyone (good study material and classes)
Thank you Haydee for all your help.
