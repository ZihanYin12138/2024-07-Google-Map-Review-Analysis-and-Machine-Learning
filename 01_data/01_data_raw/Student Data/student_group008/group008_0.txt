Had a great time. My 7 year old loved it. We didn't climb, we just watched her.  Takes some time to get good. Lots of other kids as well.  Staff was great. They set us up and let us go.  Super way to entertain a courageous kid.  Might not be good for scared kids.<//Review>

A fabulous experience at this indoor rock climbing gym. We went twice in for days, the first visit Luke helped us out and did an amazing job of taking his time explaining everything, even showed us how to belay for each other. The second visit Mike was there and he did an amazing job as well let us climb several climbs while he belayed both my husband and I   He was patient and encouraging the whole time. If you have a chance go,  check them out. We will be back on our next visit our west<//Text>

Great little trainer on the outskirts of Palm Springs. Small and intimate with a couple of belay walls and a couple of bouldering walls with standard terrain options and true-to-outdoor route grades. Great sets with challenging ratings, classes for all ages. Be aware - no locker rooms or showers available at this gym, so plan accordingly. Above all else - awesome staff and friendly community here, the two things that make any gym a pleasure to climb in. I'll definitely be visiting again!<//Review>

Very fun experience. Definitely get a harness and go on the wall where it does everything for you. It was my first rock climing and the guy working was very helpful. He had a beard and was young maybe his name was jake I forget. Also affordable and the membership pass is worth it if you like this stuff</Review>

What an awesome place! Not only is this facility impressive to see, but the experience is first rate. Desert Rocks is meticulously clean, spacious and well organized (not to mention colorful!). The staff is very knowledgeable, courteous and helpful. I brought several members from my gym and we were given 5 star treatment (hence the 5 stars in return). Everyone had a great time!  I highly recommend visiting, whether you're a novice or an experienced climber. You'll love it!</Review>

We went as a family with 13 year old son. Visiting his father for the summer we figured this would be a great way to spend time together, learn something new and build strength as a family and as individuals.
We could not have picked a better facility. From the phone call to set up the appointment/class, the welcoming staff and excellent and supportive instruction.
The five day pass is a great motivator to not overdo it on day one and a fantastic idea to get you hooked!
Really looking forward to going back for more, would definitely recommend to our friends and staff!
Great job guys!<//Review>

The prices are outrageous!! and worse part is that the facility falls short of truly offering Tall Wall climbing, an obstacle course of activities that can be part of the physical fun experience.  Definitely room for large improvement and development of the facility.   There was also no one there which could explain the word of mouth on the sentiment of this place.

Disappointed customer!<//text>

It was disappointing and the fees were outrages for basically a 10 minute rock climbing experience.    Payed $22 dollars for an Adult and $18 for a kid.   The place, is small. Beginners have two rock climbing scenarios was done in 10 minutes. No one was around for the rock climbing with the ropes as security, is the real climbing. Felt Cheated. Never going back! The kids were not happy either,  felt even worse.< /review>

Staff is really friendly and helpful.  It is a pretty small climbing gym, so if you want to do anything other than bouldering, get there when it opens.  Not a lot of walls for top rope belaying.  Climbing is always fun, and we will visit the gym again.  But, would prefer it if it were bigger, and it seemed a little odd to me that I was told the clients grade the climbs.  I am not an expert, and I rely on experts grading my climb.  Other than this, it is a lot of fun, and great place to practice</Review>

I visited a couple months ago when I was in the area. Since it was off season, on a Friday afternoon, I was one of only two climbers, which was nice. The space is small, but good for training. They offer bouldering, ropes walls, and auto belay in a smaller room. The problems were definitely set with the area in Mind, because the grading is slightly harder than most indoor gyms. I'm not a serious climber, but was still able to find problems to climb.

Jesse, the manager, and another staff member were both incredibly welcoming and helpful. I imagine this is a great community based on the people. Glad I stopped in.<//Review>

They are always re-setting their routes so climbing is never boring or predictable.  The routes vary from beginners to advanced so there is something for everyone.  It isn't usually crowded (depending on when you come) so it's a great way to get a mental and physical workout in a fun environment without too much downtime waiting for a turn.  The employees and owners are always helpful to give tips and even teach you how to climb/belay.<//Review>

went with nephews who really seem to enjoy the place which different levels or types of climbing walls some no need to use ropes or a spotter,  other ropes were fixed so they had tension so no need for a spotter in this section however only have for 2 people climbing alone. another  section several people who could use section but spotter for everyone climbing. Plenty of room for one or two people to watch and not do activity where you wouldn't be in the way.</text>

This climbing gym in North Palm Springs offers great bouldering with a small top roping wall. Kristen, Steve, and their staff are so friendly and excited to help you in any way they can. Don't let the size, or the grades, fool you. There are a variety of climbs in here and you can certainly get your fill no matter what your skill level.</Review>

Being an active climber for over 40 years, but never really been a "gym" climber, I am so very pleased to have a local climbing gym to work out at and meet people.  It may not quite be an "LA" gym, but for us desert dwellers, it's a Godsend.  I go there religiously every week from Joshua Tree and it's been nothing but awesome!   Bravo and thanks to Steve and Kristen and staff for the wonderful opportunites they have given to us. If you live in the low or high desert (or are visiting the area), check the place out;  get fit, meet very cool locals and support your local climbing community.< /review>< pictures>

Best place to spend time and get some exercise in the desert. Staff is amazing and always helpful, and the walls are switched around regularly so there is always something new to climb. I'd recommend it for people of all ages.<//text>

<Rating>2<//Rating><review>Brought 2 kids here to have some fun and we were the only ones in the place. Was a Sunday at 11am. The front desk guy gave very little help on what to do and then said he could not do more as he was the only one there. Then 2 other customers came in and he helped them into harnesses and assisted them. Was not cool at all. Finally asked to have help or our money back. His response- I already have your money! No wonder the place was empty!

Good bouldering. Most of the top rope requires a belayed but they have two auto belay in a separate room. Great staff, super friendly.<//Review>

Visit Desert Rocks for a great gravity defying workout. Professional staff makes even a novice feel at ease. Hats off, or rather, Rocks Off to owners Kristen and Steve, for bringing this cool place to the desert.< /Text>

<Text>The gym looks really nice but the woman that owns it( I think). Makes everyone feel really uncomfortable.  Even my 7 year old son asked me wha was wrong with her.  She has a fake sweet attitude that is a real turn off.  If your not a heavey rock climber I highly suggest avoiding this place.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

I notice on maps the Ralph's in south San Clemente has about 5 stars, the Ralph's in Dana Point has almost 5 stars. This Ralph's on Los Mares has 4.
Was falsely accused by Lisa of shoplifting a sandwich, that was in plain sight, had she opened her eyes.i have been banished by JudgeDredLisa from this Ralph's
Have written a detailed explanation of the incident to Ralph's.
Go to Dana Point or South SC or Stater Bros nest door.<//Text>

I get excellent customer service most of the time. Everyone from the produce department to the cashier, almost everyone is courteous, welcoming, and friendly. Definitely something people would expect from their neighborhood grocery store! I love this grocery store because it has a lot of healthy options like gluten free products, organic options, and they have an entire aisle for protein bars and healthy snacks! I go here for almost everything I need for our weekly meals. I'm a loyal customer for sure.< /text>

Lifelong Kroger shopper. This Ralph's location is one of the best. Located by a pharmacy, you will find that their shower and make up selection is limited. But what they lack and shampoo, they more than make up for in their produce section. They always have good sales on fresh produce and the staff who work the produce department are friendly and professional.< /Review>

So I buy all of my groceries here but tonight I had a questionable, maybe illegal experience. I like to have a martini after work but tonight, there was a problem with the security cap on some vodka. No problem right? The checker went and got me a different bottle. When I got home, I noticed that it had been opened already. No big deal, it's happened before. But it sure tasted watered down! Then when I put it in the freezer, the alcohol froze!!! Everyone knows that vodka doesn't freeze so my suspicions were totally validated! Check your bottles before leaving this place! The stockers must have a taste for booze!!!!</Text>

Not only do they need self-checkout, but on more than one occasion I've gone to the so-called "Express Line" only to find someone with a packed cart in front of me being cheerfully checked out. Now, the shopper is partially to blame for having the nerve to line up there - yes, other lines were open - but it turned out the checker INVITED them in!  If you're not going to enforce the policy, DON'T PUT THE DAMN SIGN UP!!  I'll be at Stater's or Albertson's if you need me...<//Text>

The western union service they provide is awful, the system never work, i call everytime i go to pick money and even when they said is working by phone, as soon as i arrive to the store they haven't service, if the problem is Western unión and not ralphs system maybe will better stop giving that service because just add a bad image to the store<//text>

It's a typical Ralph's. Parking is kinda rough here... It's located across the lot from Trader Joe's where I do a majority of my shopping. Hit Ralph's for the items I can't find at TJs< /text>

Amazing. Every. Time.  The Brass Monkey pizza is consistently one of the best i've ever had.  The crust, the chunky tomato sauce, the tasty sausage.  And the salad, while pretty simple, rocks my world every time I eat it too.  Its usually just the wife and I eating, but I love it when we have others with us so that I can order the amazing chicken wings as well.< /Review>

<review>Ordered a pizza and was told 40 minutes. Called an hour later to no answer. Called 15 more times over the next half hour until they just turned their phones off for the night and went home. Charged me 30 dollars for ONE pizza and didn't deliver and then just left for the night. A complete joke. This is known as theft in most places. Now it's too late to order from somewhere else. I will never order from this place again. Loot this place if you're near it.</review>< time>

No napkins seved, had to ask from thw surly cook guy who seemed put out. The coffee allowed me a moment of joy. 21$ tossed for an upset stomach later. Yuch. Avoid this place if you want food.

This RoundTable Pizza has just been opened up in Glendale CA. I visited it a couple days ago for their lunch buffet and the food and service is just AMAZING! The cashier is very helpful and informative! The prices are unbeatable too! Monday-Friday 11AM-2PM $7.99 all you can eat lunch buffet! Stop by and enjoy some delicious pizza!</Review>

Edit: Pizza buffet is from 11-2pm Mon-Fri!

Had the pizza buffet on 07/29/19 - will update this review once I try it again in a month or so. Since it was their first day open with the buffet there is obviously some room for improvement (credit card machine, pizza overcooked, etc), but the second batch of pizzas that came out were good. Breadsticks were also crunchy and dry and that didn't need to get replenished, so not sure if that was a one time thing. As it is new, very clean, nice staff, and a decent amount of sitting space. Will be interesting when/if this place gets more packed during the buffet times as there is probably only space for about four pizzas or so at a time.

I will be back!</Text>

Nice workers, VERY clean. Parking is a bit odd, and I thought I was locked out when I used the stairs, figured out you have to use the elevator to go down. Probably wouldn't be a big deal but I just finished driving for 6 hours so very tired and got freaked out a bit for a moment. A sign saying to use elevator to go down would be a great idea, or have the stairs unlocked during the day.<//Text>

<username>Deborah Krueger<//username><Resp>None< /Resp><text>I always receive outstanding service, both from the dental hygienists and the front desk assistants. Everything is always explained in detail and my well-being during my visit is always considered. If I ask for a price in advance of a future procedure, they always oblige me. Dr. Lapidus is always professional and takes time to explain my x-rays. He's very proactive, giving options for how/when to address any potential work that needs to be done. I have been with Dr. Lapidus over five years and highly recommend him as a dentist that you can rely on. His commitment to his patients is stellar!< /text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I’m so happy I’ve found Dr Lapidus. He’s great, and also has a fantastic hygienist. Heather gives the most thorough and comprehensive cleanings I’ve ever had. But she’s also extremely careful and gentle, so it isn’t painful. I also appreciate how willing she is to share her extensive knowledge about how to make your teeth healthier. It’s not the normal lecture about flossing. Instead, it’s practical advice that you can actually use. They’re the things that no one else has taken the time to tell you about, but make a difference. Everything she does makes you feel like she cares about her patients.< /Text><name>Julie Jorgensen<//name>< pics>

<Review>My spouse and I have really enjoyed our care in Dr. Lapidus office!  He gives so much information including details I’ve never heard before from previous dentists (general dental knowledge as well as specific information about how my teeth are aligned).

He also uses some newer technology like the scanner for my night guard - previously I’ve had to endure the uncomfortable goop in my mouth but this last time they just used a handheld camera scanner that was so much easier!< /Review>< pictures>

Dr Lapidus has an extremely calming and soothing bedside manner. Some may interpret it as nonchalance but that's not it. He's committed to providing the best solutions and presenting any choices with data and years of experience. He just does it with a calming presence. Highly recommend!< /Text>

Excellent service all the way around.  I had a broken denture and it was ready the next day.  Far cheaper than I expected.  I have been a patient for more than 15 years.  Every visit was 5 star, even when I left with fewer teeth than when I went in.< /Text>

Dr. Lapidus is a fellow veteran who has provided me and my wife with top-notch dental care since we moved to San Luis in 2018.  I'm impressed with how he and his brilliant staff have responded to challenges posed by C-19, and felt extremely safe during my cleaning, x-rays, and check-up today.  If you're looking for excellent dental care, I recommend Dan without reservation.< /text>

I really liked how Heather told me as she went along what she was doing and was so professional yet warm and caring.  Dr. Lapidus role models these qualities himself: smart, I know I am in good hands, explains choices well, respectful and caring.  Am very impressed and grateful!<//Text><userid>104692929433197015257</userid>< Name>

<Review>10/1/2020  -  The highlight of my dental appointment was the covey of quails that paraded by the window while I was in the dental chair waiting for Dr. Lapidus to start working on my cavities.  Dr. Lapidus and his staff are always concerned about the comfort of their patients.  Happy to say that I am home now and I am not in any pain.

Today (March 10, 2021) my appointment in this office was for a 6 month    cleaning.  I wasn't in the room where the window faces the hillside where I saw the covey of quails tripping along behind the Mama.  Nevertheless, my appointment went well.  I was praised for taking good care of my teeth and gums and was told to "Keep up the good work!".  Dr. Lapidus stuck his head in to see how I was doing which is just one of his friendly gestures.  I'll be back in September for another check-up and cleaning.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>My wife and I have seen several dentists in SLO county over the years but Dr. Lapidus is the best. His staff are kind, professional and very helpful. The hygienists are great and very knowledgeable. Dr. Lapidus himself is just fantastic. You can tell he loves his craft and focuses on what is best for his patients. If you need a dentist give them a chance. You won't regret it.</review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<review>They are awesome they helped get all my stuff hooked up protected and we had plenty of laughs in doing it all. They taught me stuff I didn't know about.

Gabe and the other assistant manager(i apologise profusely for not remembering. I am awful with names) are geniuses. It seems they have a good team at that store right now. I gauge it on how many familiar faces I see in associates. Thank you again, guys!!!<//text>

<Date>1509158258924</Date><Rating>1< /Rating><Text>I came to this specific location because it is a corporate store. It's big and spacious. That's about the only good thing I can say. I came to ask about getting my phone fixed. I pay over $100 a month and I have insurance on it. The phone itself has the GPS settings burned onto the screen. You can see them no matter what app I'm using and it's really annoying to see them there. I walk in and am instantly greeted. Forgot the guys name but I can tell he had good intentions. I tell him my problem and show him the phone. He then tells me they don't fix phones or do any type of repairs at this location. Turns out they don't have tech guys for that sort of thing. I ask what type of services they offer? He then tells me I can pay my bill and they can help me with upgrades or go over my phone plan if I have questions about that. I respond, in a calm manner, so this corporate store can only sell me phones and services? He says, no we can do simple repairs that don't require tech guys. And I add, but you can't replace my screen or even make an effort to see if I can get a warranty replacement? He then tells me I have to go all the way to Lodi, because that is the only corporate store that has tech guys on site, to get my phone fixed. I add one last time, so you can't do anything for me but sell me phones and services? He says no. Unfortunately only the Lodi location, being the closest, can help you. Like are you serious? This is absurd. Absolutely ridiculous. I had just came from the metro store around the corner, girlfriend's phone had issues, and even they had way better customer service than this. They actually ordered her a new phone and it wasn't even under warranty so how can sprint, being sprint, not even budge for a loyal customer. Maybe THAT was sprint being sprint. Literally, why even pay for insurance when I can't walk into a corporate store to make a claim. A legitimate one at that. Total waste of time, don't ever come to this location, seriously. Unless you just want to upgrade or buy more services. The phone in question is a Samsung galaxy s7. Friday October 27, at about 7:15 pm is when I visited this location. I've been with them for about 5 years and It's the first time I've ever needed to make an insurance claim.</Text>< pictures>

Heavy breathing, claustrophobic, really hot inside. My sales rep Marilyn kept asking me if I was ready to proceed forward numerous times. Felt hostile to the situation as she previously mentioned she was off @6 and it was 9:30 lol who does that. My Paul Blanco car buying experience was much easier than leasing the iPhone 6s and they approved me with a 22.9% interest loan. Eventually she started explaining in depth features of the phone as well as the plan and what I was getting with my package. She made the experience fun and was just looking out for me. Overall she took great care of me and I love my new IPhone 6s. Best Customer service hands down go check her out.
Merry Christmas

The worst costumer services. They have you sign in when they feel like so they don't know who got there first. Then they ignore the list and just yell out "whose next". These employees are so unprofessional they told customers to go to another sprint bc they were to busy and were laughing about it. The manager has not done their job and trained these workers<//text>

<Text>The Manager Classifies Customers, Racial Profiles Everyone, i Observed Him Very Well The Way He Is With Certain People He Will send you to a certain customer service rep based on appereance, Manager Is A Sexist.
he took care of white customers very friendly.
He was very short on conversations with colored people.

My name was up on a screen First to be up with customer service, he acted like he didnt see me . Taunting me and started to help 2 young girls smiling he did it again while i was checking out phones, I have tattoos all up to my neck he kept ignoring me. Deleted my name from screen pretended like as if i was a ghost, He Told Jeff To Take Care Of Me Last .

I WALKED INN AFTER I FINISHED A APPLICATION OVER THE PHONE WITH SPRINT CREDIT DEPARTMENT. SO BEFORE I COULD MOVE FORWARD WITH APPLICATION  ACCOUNT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE VERIFIED. I EXPLAINED TO THE INDIVIDUAL I JUST NEEDED TO CONFIRM MY IDENTITY.
JEFF STARTED ANOTHER APPLICATION
RAN MY CREDIT WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.
AFTER HE GOT OFF THE PHONE HE SAID HE APOLAGIZED AND TO APPLY AGAIN IN 60 DAYS. I ALREADY HAD AN ACCOUNT ALREADY HAD AN APPLICATION PENDING OVER THE PHONE, THIS PERSON RUNS MY CREDIT AGAIN WITHOUT ASKING ME WITHOUT MY CONSENT. I WILL SUE THIS COMPANY VERY SOON. JEFF AND YOUR MANAGER WILL HEAR FROM BBB VERY SOON I RECORDED EVERYTHING.

AMERICA - EQUAL RIGHTS TO EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY, YOU VIOLATED BILL OF RIGHTS. WE THE PEOPLE.

YOU AINT NO EQUAL RIGHTS AMERICAN, YOU EMBARRASE THE AMERICAN FLAG AS AN AMERICAN YOU HAVE ALOT OF NERVE TREATING PEOPLE THIS WAY DONT KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HAD TO GO THRU TO BECOME MANAGER.

If you live in Stockton, Sprint has to be among the worst things in the world to deal with. No signal anywhere hardly. The majority of the phones are LTE equipped with no WiMax 4g capability meaning you only have 3g coverage if you are lucky enough to get a signal for even that. I am stuck in a contract that is not financially reasonable to break free of, and my current phone is having issues which means I need to replace it. I do not look forward to my future as a Sprint customer, but I do need a new phone right now. Leaving me with only the choice of a new contract and subsidized phone.

I will say that after I spoke with Christopher at Sprint today I did feel that the problems with sprint are not the fault of the individual stores and that his suggestion and help today was probably the only positive Sprint related experience I've ever had.<//text>

<Text>Sprint has all the requirements to be one of the worst cellphone companies in the U.S.A.

But specifically talking about this store the waiting time to be attended is insanely long

Did I mention that the employees at this place are also very slow some of them very rude and like other reviewer said these people scann your ID everytime they need to access your account which in my opinion that is not right

They offer you insurance for your phone but their repair service is among the worst they only have technicians in certain areas, we have to drive 45 minutes to get our phone fixed then leave the phone for 3 to 5 days to drive another 45 minutes to go picked it up very inconvinient!

The deductibles are also insanely high here are some examples:

For fixing a broken screen: $100
For replacing your phone with an used one: $200

Just do the math, the most common problems for a phone owner is a broken glass screen.

in my case is an iphone 7 if I would take it to a certified store to get it fixed it will cost me $170 you would probably say: thats a 70 dollar difference but the thing is that I been paying insurance for more than a year 14 months to be exact 13 dollars a month so basically I will be paying sprint $282 for getting my phone fixed

That is terrible! And thats my story planning to dumped this horrible company in the following months

I almost forget to mention that sprint also has one of the worst coverage in this country<//Text><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80900d7a36fb3e37:0xdeb32cd40e832a2e<//gmapID>< user_id>

The team was fantastic. They were professional and courteous from the moment I walked in the door.  I didn’t have an appointment and they were able to immediately get my car back, estimated that it might take until the next day but were able to turn around my car with all the repairs day of. I received a call once it was completed and was able to pick my car back up that evening. Great customer service and fantastic work. I’d highly recommend them!</Text>

<Text>Have taken our company trucks here for tires and alignment and couldn't be happier with the service we receive. These guys have been here forever and are real pro's - they do what they say and charge a fair price for it.  Very reliable and work is complete when they promised. would recommend to anybody looking for a reliable company with no drama or pressure to do unneeded repairs.</Text>< pictures>

Great place I would definitely recommend for tires.
I would have given them five star review but I had to wait for a while when picking up my truck they only had one gentleman Alex at the front desk.

Who was answering multiple incoming calls, greeting customers, taking payments for services. He was great very knowledgeable courteous and kept his cool under pressure especially with the two customers who had a million questions and were bartering to lower the prices with out an appointment I booked my appointment over a week in advance to be able to drop off and pick up with time to get to work.

Alex definitely needed assistance at least answering phones I did hear a female voice in an office with dark glass finally answer a single call only after lines were going crazy and multiple customers in lobby.

Even with all that I would return in the feature for services location is convenient really close to my home.</review>

I've been using Western Brake for years. They have put tires and brakes on all my cars and both my kid's cars. They always turn my car around same day and usually within an hour or two.  Their prices are competitive and their service is impeccable.  Most recently they repaired the left rear power window. I highly recommend Western Brake. I will be taking my car back to them again.< /Review>

<text>My first time here, the service was Great! I appreciated the price and recommendations.  I went in for an oil change initially but almost faint...my 2 front tires was showing metal..I got a great deal..I felt like I was at the neighborhood mechanic...because of how comfortable I was waiting on my car..I will be going back for my rear tires and brakes..

I went back 2-3 weeks later in a nick of time so I did not have to replace my rotors..Service was quick and through while I waited...everyone there's nice professional and helpful!<//text></record></dataset><record>

We have been sold a faulty tire from this place. The manager Alex ...,is a liar They stumble over their own lies. It’s like who the hell does this to a 20year customer  ????  Pirelli and BBB   What’s more important a satisfactory experience or to go to court because of ignorance   Never go here ! Especially women they ARE that kind of place<//text>

<Review>Service was solid and the staff was very professional. They gave me additional service recommendations, but did not pressure me to get the work done right then and there. I was given information pamphlets. They had to reschedule my appointment, and gave me discount of $10. They didn't have enough staff that day. Not the cheapest place, but good work.<//Review><response>None</response>< Pics>

AAA picked me up...my alternator went out on the 5N freeway at rush hour. The tow truck took me to Western Brake and Tire later that evening. The Key drop box was easy. Tech called me the next morning and had my SUV ready by noon.<//text>

< review>
I was very happy with my service. I was told by another auto shop that I needed front and rear brakes as well as new rotors. My car only has 48k miles and was less then 3 years old. After going to Western I was told I only needed brakes and not the rotors. The cost was also half of what I was quoted at the other shop. They have earned my future business and I recommend them highly.</review>

I came out of work to find I had two, completely flat tires. I called AAA and needed my car towed somewhere. Lucky for me, I called Western. Alex found me the best tires, at the best price and even filled out the rebate paperwork for me. The service was extremely friendly, helpful and professional. I have definitely found my new tire service/brakes location for our vehicles. My car rides so smooth and quiet now!< /Review>

I found these guys when I first moved from Texas in 2016. I'm always worried when trying to find new service businesses, especially for my car, my vet, and doctors. But, I lucked out when I found Western Brake & Auto on the first try. They have been amazing. My previous car had many issues from oil leaks to alignment issues to a/c and heating issues and they were very fair in price and off the charts service. Everyone there is super friendly and able to tell me my car's issues in a language I can understand. Paul & Joe are like the cousins you can always rely on to help you through a tough spot. I highly recommend Western Blake & Auto. So much so, that when I moved from Anaheim to LA, I didn't hesitate to continue to make the drive down to Western Brake & Auto when I need service or repairs. They will continue to have my business for as long as I'm in Southern California.<//Text>

I love Western Tire!! Many members of my family use them also.  They are efficient and trustworthy and have reasonable prices.  They never try to upsale you.  I drive 45 minutes to get my car serviced at Western Tires and it’s worth it!!<//review>

The price for the exact tires I wanted was $400 below Pepboys. The staff were respectfully kind and helpful. They called to let me know everything was going well and on schedule and called to let me know when the Jeep was ready to be picked up, two hours ahead of schedule. Our Jeep is like new and my wife and I could not be more pleased.
Thank you Western.< /text>

Same day turnaround on a battery that AAA didn’t have in stock. Great service for any auto needs tune-up, repair, and tires. The general manager of the shop, Joe, takes care of everything and has a good sense of humor. Recommended 10/10 for car maintenance.<//Review>

Weve been going to Western Tire and brake for years now. We know them well. I don’t think there’s anything on our trucks that they haven’t fixed. Perfectly btw. They are Clean, Welcoming, very professional and most important ... Very Knowledgeable! They’ve even fixed my dune buggy ❤️ I trust them. They really Care
Great Job Guys. You are Genuinely Appreciated!

<text>I found Western Brake and Tire on the AAA approved repair shops list. I took the SUV in for a creaking sound in the suspension. I told the service writer about the noise and he had their mechanic go with me for a test drive. The mechanic did a few maneuvers to test for the noise and he heard what I was describing. They did the repairs and it appears to have fixed the problem. I can’t remember the last time a mechanic test drove a car with me! Exceptional service! A pro shop. Neat and clean.</text><userid>100546651788089039206</userid><GmapID>0x80dcd7b66d622d01:0xb2cfd5700ee67f85< /GmapID><Time>1596662841581</Time><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Great workers and Robert is one of the most genuine people I’ve ever had help me at any location in the USA. He’s helped me on numerous occasions and even made a mistake by charging me extra one time and gave me an extra discount once. Very grateful for him<//Review>

We were on vacation and one of our tires started to lose pressure the day before we were to head home.  Western Brake & Tire got us in right away and fixed the problem.  We really appreciated their great service.<//review>

<Text>Both brake light were out, so this was kind of an an emergency!
Being a girl, the assumption is plan to get looted at a mechanic shop. However I was pleasantly surprised! I called on a Saturday an hour before closing and the gentleman who answered the phone explained there always is the chance they might have to order the lights, but they will try. My lucky day they had the bulbs an I was offered coffee while I waited. It wasn’t much of a wait it was done in five to ten minutes. I didn’t even have the chance to finish my coffee. They gave me the best early Christmas gift ever, SAFETY. A truly wonderful experience.
It’s good to know that there are such kind people out there.< /Text>< pictures>

I was just ready to buy all four tires because I want the entire package when it comes to replacing tires. On a road trip I got a screw in my tire. Good Year patched it and I was off! Under $25.00. Why am I surprised I didn't need new tires? Because my very own dealership tried to sell me new tires before I left...with a medium to hard sell tactic. But I wasn't quite on board with the pitch. Listen to your instincts and know your cars ladies! ....and gents! These guys made my day and we're super cheerful and it was hot. You guys rock!!!< /Text>

These guys were fantastic! Quick, clean, professional, and honest. I came in there expecting to pay close to 400 dollars but instead they were able to find the problem and I walked out only paying closer to 70 dollars. I will certainly  be going back for any future car troubles!</Review>

Too expensive $30 for tire repair for a flat. I got it  repaired down the street for $20. Even after telling the person in charge I had $25 and showed him my bank account balance. It was an emergency and I am a lady i was alone. The man was rude and careless.<//Text>

<review>I work near this business so I started going here out of convenience about 6 years ago. I decided to keep going back because they won my confidence that they're honest. With 3 kids and 4 cars I've gotten tires and service here many times. I've also recommended them to friends and coworkers. Their prices are on par with the area - so not excessive but not rock bottom either. What they do offer is quality service that they back in the off chance there's a problem. And, they're friendly too.</review><name>Victor Ziccardi< /name><Gmap_id>0x80dcd7b66d622d01:0xb2cfd5700ee67f85</Gmap_id>< time>

I had 3 nails in my tire and they fixed it very nicely. The staff is very knowledgeable and they really care about their customers! The Customer is number One here!
I highly recommend this shop for all your Tire needs including brakes, Alignments and suspension work! They are the Best in Anaheim!</Review>

<Review>Great customer service, second to none.  Fair prices, great work.  One thing to note, the bathroom is by far the cleanest of any  work facility I
have visited.   I would go back just to use the restroom.

A friend's car was making a noise. Thinking it was the brakes, drove over to have this shop check it out.  They took the tires off check and asked many times "Do you have a warranty or did you get the extended warranty?" They were so professional and helpful. The encouraged us to take the car over to Orange Ford. They did not charge a fee.  We are very impressed by their courtesy and friendly attitude.   I would recomend this shop to everyone.<//Review>

When asked they said they just had to settle in, it was fine and it was normal.  We weren't totally sure but it was past closing time, and we lived over 2 hours away.  4 months later and they're kaput, and it's Going to cost us a 1800 to get it back to working condition. Needs new pads new rotors, leaking brake fluid and the calipers locked up on some of the wheels.</review>< pictures>

My brakes went out. When I got to the shop I had to wait an hour to get a quote. The quote was $400+. I was told that the problem was my master cylinder, part came out to $170 and the $230 was labor. I priced the part on the high end at $90 and the part is only held on by 4 bolts. That plus bleeding the brakes doesn't come out to $230 worth of labor. I walked. I took my car to another mechanic and it turned out that my master cylinder was fine. The problem was a broken brake line.<//Text>

<Text>Thank you Joe and company. I was on vacation and ended up leaving these guys quite a present in the middle of the night. I was so worried I was going to get "raped". Small town country boy in big town city. I am pleased to say these boys really treated me well and were honest and fair. No raping here. Thank you so much.

I had the chance to meet everyone at fire mountain veterinary hospital as they called me to come replace their water heater. This place was booming!  Everything was so clean and everyone was so professional! They care so much for the animals they take care of! I wish you guys could be a fly on the wall to see the passion they have. So I brought my wiener dog in for a check up and a dental cleaning. They rock! His teeth are cleaner than mine!  I’m so happy to be supporting local small businesses and to find a gem like this one is great!  If you want someone to work on your animals with care and compassion I totally recommend fire mountain veterinary hospital.<//text>

<Text>Today my family had to do the hardest thing any pet parent has to do. We had to put our beloved baby to rest. Breezie wasn’t actually a baby anymore. She was 16 years old. She had an aggressive tumor that got diagnosed on September 2. It had grown triple in size by today. We had to do right by her. Dr Dodd is a wonderful Dr. this place has wonderful caring compassionate individuals whom you know are whole heartedly giving their best in what they do. I highly recommend Fire Mountain Veterinary Hospital to anyone who loves their pet. Thanks Dr Dodd to you and your crew.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkh8E9TDVSbpfcggDKV1aDVdL7KgZtR1ISXpwz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1602190739020, 'text': 'Maria,\nThank you for such kind words, especially during such a trying time for your family.

<review>Not reliable or knowledge of transferring a pet to Hawaii. The process is difficult and stressful. I had questions about the process. Got mixed answers from multiple staff members giving mixed information.  Were then rude on the phone. Tried to charge me for an exam that I didn’t ask for ( only brought the dog there for a blood test that ultimately wasn’t done due to staff not confident of process) Told me they were not liable if steps not done completely. I never said they would be liable but I expect a vet and staff who are supportive and knowledgeable. They were not. Also higher priced by over 100 dollars for same blood test that I scheduled with another vet who clearly answered my questions and was knowledgeable in the process. If traveling with a pet I would recommend not to use this vet as they don’t seem knowledgeable or happy to help + overpriced compared to others in the area.< /review>< Pics>

Amazing veterinary hospital with an amazing staff. I helped a friend take his dog here as there was something wrong under his throat. They welcomed us immediately and took no time to help us. They were kind and gentle to my friends dog. Basically made the dog feel safe and at home. They were very knowledgeable and knew what they were doing. Because of them our dog is back to normal and the swelling under his throat is gone.<//Text>

< Review>
We have been when Fire Mountain Vet for two years now and in the 16 years that I've had a companion animal, they have been the most thorough and loving veterinary clinic we have ever trusted with the care of our two dogs. Dr. Vasilas and her staff take the time to get to know your companion, and your concerns. We recently had to say goodbye to our loving shih tzu at age 16 years and 9 months, and even in the midst of discomfort and confusion, he was wagging his tail when he saw members of the Fire Mountain team come in. The day we said goodbye was the most difficult in my life, and this team not only cared for our animals and assured that our shih tzu left this world peacefully, but they cared for us, the devastated pet parents,  and made everything as easy as possible for us in this process. I wish we had known this clinic from day one of pet parenthood.</Review>

This place is like a shady mechanic. They suggested I get an X-ray for my cat when they KNEW their X-ray machine was not working and needed to be fixed. They then released my cat without a word in regards to the x-ray not being performed, no info on after care, and they did not mention they weren't able to give me the pain meds my cat "needed" until the next day. These people DO NOT care about your furry family members. Find another vet.< /Text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>Very friendly staff , kinda come off fake though, but only want money out of you. Please review your bill and I suggest you call petco to see if they have the medication they’re recommending for your animal. Our dog had an ear infection and the vet tried to charge us double the price for the medication when it was available for half off at Petco. Also, they suggested my dog get his ears cleaned at the vet (30 dollars just to pour liquid inside his ears ) prior to being given his ear solution but I called two different other vets and they said the puppy’s ears should not be flushed. The puppy should receive the ear solution prior to being flushed. Go elsewhere if you’re able to. We only came cause no other vet had appointments available and our pup needed his shots<//review><gmapID>0x80dc71db8d130aa9:0x41ca0924d926b9a8< /gmapID>< UserId.>

{'time': 1600033531881, 'text': 'Karina,\nWe understand it can be hard to be alerted to a medical concern during a vet visit you expected to only be for preventative vaccines, and we are sensitive to the fact that this can be especially challenging during this period of COVID19 during which finances are strained for many of us pet parents. We want to reiterate that our only intention in bringing this concern to your attention during Levi’s vaccine visit was for his well-being, to alleviate his infection and discomfort. We cannot speak to suggestions provided by another establishment; we can only advise based on our philosophy of best medicine, which includes cleaning out debris from the infected ear with the appropriate prescription solution (a process known as flushing) prior to administering antibiotics, otherwise the antibiotics cannot penetrate the ear canal well enough to eradicate the infection. This flushing process can be tricky for the untrained eye, so our suggestion to have it be done by our team is only in an effort to ensure successful treatment of the infection. In reference to purchasing medications at other establishments, we cannot speak to products sold elsewhere. We can only provide our clients the option to purchase the products from within our pharmacy that we know and trust to be safe and effective, which given their prescription strength and medical soundness, will differ in price from over-the-counter versions sold elsewhere. We hope that this explanation clears up any confusion, and we apologize for any miscommunication that may have occurred during Levi’s visit. We hope Levi is feeling better and we remain a resource for any future pet needs you have.'}< /Response>

Because of covid 19 restrictions you don't wait inside the office for your pet to be seen. They actually come out to your car! And they keep coming back and forth... Them  caring enough to work around these restrictions  says a lot about them.
They fixed my landlady's cat right up.
I like these people.</Review>

I really like this establishment and all who provide care for the animals. I will say that they completely overcharge for meds. It's almost ridiculous. Otherwise I can say they are very professional, kind, knowledgeable, and friendly. Just overpriced. Capstar is only 32.00 at Target for 6 pills. I was charged 45.00 for 2 pills here. When times are as tuff as they are now it's just not right to overcharge. I suggest to people who bring their animals here, have them exam your dog and get your medication elsewhere. This will save you a ton of money.</text>

{'time': 1604776650011, 'text': 'Karen,\nThank you for your kind words referencing our professionalism, friendliness and knowledge. We appreciate this feedback greatly. We also appreciate you raising your concerns regarding pricing, as it provides us with an opportunity to offer an explanation that will hopefully shed light on the cost discrepancies you’ve described. Our one-location hospital is a family owned and operated, local, small business and we are one of the few remaining non-corporate veterinary hospitals in our area. As a small business, our pricing structure varies greatly from that of large, international corporations like Target, and even that of large-scale, corporate veterinary hospitals. For many reasons, the price of goods at large corporations is able to be less than the price of goods at small, locally owned and operated businesses. We hope that, despite our inability to compete with corporate pricing, that you and other pet parents reading this will continue to support local by not only utilizing our hospital for its diagnoses, but for all of your pet healthcare needs – medications, included. We value the business of our community, and recognize that without your support and loyalty we couldn’t continue saving lives.\nWarmly,\nFire Mountain Veterinary Hospital'}< /response>

Our dog Piper went in for teeth cleaning, mass removal and to get nails cut back. We had the best experience and so did Piper. Her teeth look like she is a puppy again and the sutures on her leg from the mass removal are phenomenal. Everyone there were so professional and gracious dealing with our baby. Thank you to everyone at Fire Mountain Veterinary Hospital.< /text>

Really happy with Dr Dodd and the entire staff. After trying several vets since moving, it's so nice to have found the ONE. Dr. Dodd is a great listener and her treatment suggestions are on point.  From the call to make the appointment to the end of your appointment it's so pleasant, and prompt. I also believe they were less expensive than others, which I was not expecting.< /Text>

We found Fire Mountain Veterinary Hospital about 3 months ago out of an emergency situation on a Saturday and his regular vet could not fit him in. We called around and FMVH said they could get him in right away to check his eye. So out of something negative for our pet, came something positive and that was finding Dr. Dodd and Dr. Vasilas who are both so nice. Every time we bring Dozer in, I go home raving about the whole staff and their customer service. Each employee there that I have dealt with have been super cool.  Just 2 weeks ago our dog had to have his eye removed due to glaucoma. Dr. Dodd performed the surgery, was amazing and Dozer has fully recovered.The wound is completely healed and he is a happy dog again.<//review>

I have been coming here for a couple of years now with my two dogs, my new kitty, and my cat Leo who unfortunately, crossed the rainbow bridge under their amazing care. This whole team is caring, compassionate, knowledgeable, and professional. They know me and my pets by name as soon as we come in. I couldn't imagine seeing another vet besides Dr. Vasalis. This little office is truly a gem.</review>

<Text>This is a really great vet. They got my dog in the same day. Our longtime vet is in Santa Ana which we would go to if we were closer but, Roo needed to be seen on Monday and our vet isn't open on Mondays. The staff was so friendly. I know EVERYTHING about my dog and as I was talking to Adrian (forgive the spelling) she never gave me the feeling that I was a helicopter parent. In my opinion you can't know too much about your pet. She listened to my concerns and we came up with a plan after the vet saw Roo and diagnosed him with an allergy, not an infection. It's comforting knowing Roo has great care while we're in Oceanside with a vet and staff who seem to care almost as much as Dr Weber. ☺ I definitely couldn't recommend this vet more after our initial visit.< /Text>< pictures>

this is the very best place to take your pet for all their large and small needs!
The staff is professional and friendly and extremely accommodating as to appointments. The rates are very reasonable and every effort is taken to explain all the issues at hand.
It is so important to find a vet that you feel you can trust your best friends health to ...so go here and you will be in great hands!< /review>

They always take the time to help my kitty out. I like that options are awalys provided before they do anything to your Animal. They let you  pick and choose what feels right for your fur baby. And follow up testing is normally given without paying another appointment/checkup fee. All in all, good service. The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that it seems they are more geared up for dogs rather than cats. That being said, if you live locally, this is a really decent and affordable place to come. The staff is always helpful.< /review>

<review>We learned of this vet through a pet rescue that we worked with. We never feel pushed into more than we're asking for at this vet, whereas we have been pressured for the "upsell" at other vet offices we have been to. Compassionate care for our animals without the pressure or guilt. We drive 2 cities over to come here!<//review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<text>Found the perfect place to take our two dogs. Dr Juli was amazing with them. Had their annual checkups done and a small lump removed from our dogs back.   The facility was super clean, plenty of parking and a friendly staff.

Highly recommended!!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<review>I have been pleased with the service. I have walked in and always received immediate or same day appointments. I appreciate the extra time taken by the doctor and staff to explain the procedures, how to better care for my pet's and preventative care for my pet's. They are open every day and have reasonable prices for routine shots and other preventative health care.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We have been looking for a vet that we can be comfortable with for sooo long. We finally found one. We have been taking our 2 Danes to Dr. Juli for over a year now, and we couldn't be happier. She is so knowledgeable, very friendly and (most importantly) very fair with her pricing. We never feel like we are being fleeced, in fact, we feel like she cares more about healthy pets and happy customers than making huge profits.
Also, her office staff are super friendly and really good with our dogs. Always helpful and easy to work with.
If you have pets, you will be very happy with this vet office. We are.</Review>< rating>

Best Vet We've Had! Our dog is almost 11 and have had 3 Vets over the years. I found Fire Mountain on Yelp and they are awesome. Very clean, never wait and very thorough exams. They don't over treat and very fair with pricing as well. Easy to get in if my dog needs immediate care.</review>

I am so impressed with fire mt veterinary hospital!!
My bulldog needed soft palate surgery, and was struggling with her breathing..
Dr Kramer immediately took an interest ... And went into great detail to describe the surgery to me, in completely honest terms... This is a higher risk surgery.. And I was understandably nervous ...
Dr Kramer and the entire staff were great!! They are so caring and considerate..  This is the first time I have been in a vets office , where I felt like it was about my dog's
Wellbeing, more than about the money!
The surgery went great!!  Dr Kramer made calls after Sushi was home to check on her...
And I now feel like I have great veterinary care for her...<//text>

A friend, who has a pet care business, recommended Fire Mountain Vet, and I'm so glad I took her advice! The doctor is warm and caring. He advised treatment of my dog in a measured, conservative way...one step at a time, without "loading up the shopping cart" at the outset. There was no up-selling that I've experienced with other vets. My dog was very well cared for and the pricing was reasonable.  Dr. Cramer will be caring for all my pets from now on!<//text>

Fire Mountain Veterinary Hospital is great! I called on an unexpected breathing/sneezing problem with my cat, Phineas von Fogg. They told me to bring him in right away. This was on a Saturday. They were very friendly, professional, and courteous to us. They explained everything in detail, what was going on with Phineas. They were so kind to Phineas, it relieved his anxiety, (and ours) from his car ride to the vet right away. I have recommended them to all my friends with pets, and would recommend them to others.</text>

<Review>My family have been clients since the first month the Hospital opened. We have been supported through illness and death of a beloved dog and have a healthy 10 year old cat who, while not happy to see Shannon or Dr. Vasilas, gets regular check ups and her nails trimmed. Would trust pets to these wonderful people any time.< /Review><rate>5<//rate>< username>

I went there for my pit bull when he got attacked by another dog. He needed surgery (temporary drainage tube implant) and the bill was a surprisingly low $400! My pup healed perfectly, they didn't judge him based on his breed, and it has been 3 years and he is happy with no scars. Definitely recommend them and will definitely be back!<//Text>

< Review>
The front desk and assistant girl was super nice. The vet seemed nice but I did feel like she was trying to get more and more money out of me. They wanted to charge $200 more than a really nice place called Advanced Pet Care in San Elijo area. I went here (Fire Mountain) for a second opinion for my dog. They wanted to add on a ton of things which is what made the surgery super expensive. On the phone before coming in they said it would be around $350-$450 for lump removal and neuter. I get there and pay the $47 to get him checked out and they tell me $900. Will never be coming back.</Review>

<Review>Dr. Kramer is the best. Very thorough and kind. He does not push extras if you say you don't need them. He is very efficient and cares for my dog. The front end staff of ladies are always so friendly and nice. My shitzu, Charger is a happy doggie :)   I would definitely recommend this vet to everyone, which I have to my mom and sisters and friends!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< name>

Next time when someone comes to pick up their animal they have entrusted you with it might be a good idea someone is there to tell you what has been done and what you should do after leaving. Not I'll take your payment now and here's your animal goodbye.

Just some advice.< /Text>

<userid>106536484887903978663</userid><text>Last Saturday, April 1st I found something I thought was worms in my Dolly's stool and got so scared. She is a rescue dog and is my Emotional Support dog now. Since I am a senior and on a fixed income I was really scared as to what would happen to her (and us) A Dr. Court Cramer was there and took care of everything.  He was so nice and caring I will be sure to take her there when she has something wrong with her.  Dr. Court  said he would check out the specimen I brought in but they thought is was not from her.  I believe she still has something going on with her ears and would like for him to check it out.  Also I believe she will need something done about her teeth.  I am sure he would take good care of her if I have to have that done.  It worries me since she is so small, she was found in the desert in Arizona when I lived there and I had just lost our Service dog that was for my husband and Iand I did not ever want another one but had to foster Dolly and of course just had to keep her since she had been through so much  before. Had to give her a home with love.  Since I found someone that seemed to care as much as I do about animals  I will give my visit a FIVE STAR rating.<//text>< GmapID>

<Review>I brought my 7 month old puppy here to be spayed after I cancelled my appointment at another vet here in town. I had read some not great reviews and wasn't pleased at my previous visit with them so I was in the market for a new vet. I called on the evening of the 14th to see what their availability was after inquiring on their prices and reading their great reviews. The girl who answered the phone was extremely kind and helpful. I was expecting to wait at least a week or two to get my puppy in but was delighted when she said I could bring her in the next day! I brought her in, and unlike the previous vet,  the girl at the front seemed excited to see my puppy and myself and was very sweet. I had many choices I could add on with the surgery and found they were reasonably priced. I chose to have the laser add on and feel that it was a great decision. She's only 4 days post surgery and her incision looks great and she acts like her normal self. Calmer (thanks to the meds) but still her happy self. The vet was incredibly knowledgable and even called me personally to let me know how my puppy's surgery went. She also greeted me when I picked her up that evening and recapped the whole thing.

My dogs are like family to me and I only want the best for them -- that's why Fire Mountain is our new vet! Wouldn't go anywhere else!<//Review>< name>

<text>Always caring, professional and have always treated us like family. I met the Fire Mountain folks when I moved to Oceanside 5 years ago when my sweet baby Kali girl, a 2 YO old blue Amstaff tangled with some hidden razor wire; I walked in unannounced because she was bleeding badly from a 2" gash on her left front leg, they took her in right right away and did an excellent job of suturing her wound. I now live 50 mikes away in Hemet, CA and STILL travel to OUR vet, Fire Mountain. Thanks for accepting Kali and I into your family!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Review>I went to this place for about 6 years and it was great. Now there is new management, inflated prices, and terrible staff. They overcharged me on my last visit, and I cannot even get anyone to call me back to discuss it. Also my dog was there wating to be picked up, and I waited 20 minutes after my scheduled pick up time for someone to show up...when I did it was obvious he was not cared for and standing in his own urine and feces.<//Review>< Rate>

I relocated to Oceanside a few months ago and my neighbor referred me to Dr. Cramer, a veterinarian in Oceanside. The front desk staff was very courteous when I walked in and I was in an exam room within a few minutes.

My rescued border collie mix didn't seem nervous at all to be here and he's normally stressed when I take him to see a veterinarian. Dr. Cramer spent a lot of time answering my questions and my dog, Zeus really liked him. I will be back.<//Review>

We have brought our dog to see Dr. Vasilas at Fire Mountain for the past 2.5 years. Although I live in La Jolla, the care at Fire Mountain is wonderful and is well worth the drive. Dr. Vasilas is timely, astute, thorough, and reasonable in her suggestions. She always follows up on labs and calls to see how our dog is doing when he has any concerning issues. We have seen a total of 3 other veterinarians (in OH and NY) prior to moving to California, and among them all I trust her assessments the most and find her pricing the most reasonable. I have had similarly wonderful experience with all of the staff. I would highly recommend Fire Mountain to anyone seeking a veterinarian.</Review>

My 90 year old mother-in-law lives in Carlsbad and had not had any good experiences with the Animal Hospital in Carlsbad. She is elderly with an older cat and wanted a vet she could trust "not to take her to the cleaners" and give her cat good care at a fair price. I only come into town once or twice a year and when she asked me to "find a good vet", I felt fairly lost.

I am so glad we tried Fire Mountain. Dr. Cramer understood her concerns, her budget constraints and her wishes and gave Kissy the best care! The staff was very informative and helpful. The office and exam rooms were clean (they even smelled good!), and he listened to what she wanted before starting in on treatment she didn't want or need. The cost was extremely reasonable and I found everyone in the practice to be very professional. They even followed up by sending her a business card so she would have the information handy if she should need it.

Since I am away most of the time, I feel very confident that she will get the best care there ( and NOT be taken advantage of) if she should need to take Kissy in again. Having a vet I can trust is very important to me and I am relieved to know they are there when I can't be.<//Text>

<rating>2<//rating><name>Shelby Orlick< /name><Text>Though they did save my pup's life and I am grateful, they also never found out what was wrong with him resulting in steroid induced Cushing's because he was on prednisone for over a year. We did end up changing veteranary hospitals due to the face that we felt like they were just trying to squeeze money from us towards the end of this facility seeing him, but mostly because we wanted a second opinion. Again, I hold no grudge considering they saved my dog's life, but they are also one of the reasons that we may have to put him down now... we could have had these amswers much sooner and fire mountain also was withholding information about results from the tests that they were running. It wasn't until they faxed our informaton to the new hospital that we found out our pup was still ill but no further testing had been requested... anyway, the facility is very expensive but the staff is friendly and they could save your dogs life. Just be careful and do your own research as well.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Time>1502431315983</Time><UserId.>102807459004881915262</UserId.>< Resp>

< review>
We found Fire Mountain Vet Hospital by googling teeth cleaning for dogs. We had recently rescued a 3 year old Aussie named Newman who was in poor health, underweight, matted with lots of fleas. We made an appt right away with our prior Vet (who we love dearly) for a check up, shots and scheduled him to be neutered and discussed the fact that his teeth were in need of a cleaning badly. Three months later we take Newman in for the preop for teeth cleaning surgery and lab work. The bill for the lab work was $286.00 and the estimate from the 3rd party teeth cleaning was $550.00 to $857.00. I was not going to be gouged for teeth cleaning like so many people have been from the horror story reviews I read.

At this point my guard is WAY up after reading a plethora of reviews when I decide to call Fire Mtn Vet Hospital. The Vet Tech I spoke to told me their price of $199.00 (includes lab work) for a dog weighing over 35l bs.

To put this into perspective I'm an honest professional car salesman by trade, (yes this is possible) I deal with customers every day who have had a prior negative experience buying a car and they're waiting, looking for a lie to validate their fears from the past. In that moment I felt like the sweet little naive lady from Pasadena who had just met the most notorious evil slippery used car salesman stereotype. She's just been widowed having never made a vehicle purchase because her late husband always took care of that.
I was looking for the lie or up sale as this price was too good to be true. Upon arrival I hesitantly signed a waiver stating if while Newman was under anaesthetics and they found a tooth that needed to be pulled there would be an additional charge. Dr Krammer took the time to explain the procedure and the likely outcome. He was so thoughtful to us and to Newman, this man really loves dogs and appreciates his clients. An hour later we get a call from the Vet Tech, Newman did great and will be ready in 30 min she said. My first question was how much is the bill? Vet Tech replied $199.00. When we picked up Newman we brought our 13 yr old Standard Poodle (Zeke) with us who was due for an exam. Dr Krammer said he had time and saved us a trip back. I didn't ask price this time as Dr Krammer and his staff had earned our trust in every way a Vet should.

We now order our Royal Canin food through Fire Mtn as they are $8.00 less for a 24 lb bag and they match or beat pet meds for prescriptions. I didn't intend on writing a novel but I really wanted to give a shout out to all the great staff at Fire Mountain Vet Hospital, they're the best!!!

Randy, Lori, Zeke, Newman, Mr Boo, Purrla and Sox :)</review>

I initially brought my female dobe here in an emergency because of an infection. From the very first visit I decided to switch my vet care to Fire Mountain. The entire staff here has been nothing but accommodating and upfront about any concerns I’ve had with my dog. I even just referred a friend today that’s moving here to have her three pets go to this office. Thanks Fire Mountain for taking care of my girl!< /text>

<review>I've been eating there for over 10 years now. Their food is delicious. Portions r generous, and prices are beyond reasonable. I have probably averaged eating there 3 to 4 times a month since around 2010, maybe late 2009. Consistently  good, fresh,and beyond reasonably priced. Kung Pao is awesome..Broccoli beef and chicken..Cashew Chicken. Not a bad item on the menu and I very tried nearly all of em.< /review>< pictures>

I go to this unique restaurant many times since I love the special air that is outline this place. The personel is highly helpful and well trained. The service is extremely quick. Not to mention, the food they serve is highly distinguished. I came often and I was always happy. The expense is modest. I highly recommend this place to my friends and family.< /Text>

<Review>Delicious !!! Went here for lunch after reading some good reviews good choice got the #1 combo came with a perfect amount of food for 2 a container fully filled with fried rice container of my sweet and sour chicken and container of chow menu for less then 9 dollars !!! What a deal and when I got to eat it it was quality there chowmein is basic and delicious the chicken was cooked well the breading stayed in wasn’t falling off the rice was flavorful with lots of veggies and it was prepared very quick by a very sweet little old lady will definitely stop by if craving Chinese in the area again if you live near by or see them in door dash give them a try they do phone orders also</Review>< Pictures>

First time in California I was looking for some local Chinese food. This was close to my hotel so I thought I would try it. Food was good the egg rolls were some of the best I’ve had in a long time. They were a bit greasy though. Service was friendly.< /Text>

Stay far away from here! Worst excuse for Chinese food I have ever eaten! There was only a single guy running the place and he wasn't even Chinese but obviously Korean. I decided to order the "orange chicken" (really just sweet & sour chicken) w/steamed rice and a small chow mein and it came out to $10.51. The guy knew he was ripping me off because as I had a $10 bill in my hand and I was looking for a dollar in my wallet, he goes $10 is good enough! When I got home with the food, I found that except for the chicken, it was barely hot! The rice was lukewarm! The chow mein was lukewarm and the soggiest I've ever had like they were cooked in the microwave! No wonder he made my order so fast! The guy doesn't even have a deep fryer because my "orange chicken" wasn't crispy either and so soggy and nasty! I wasted my money and time coming here! You've been warned!< /text>

First time today.  I ordered the Shrimp FRIED RICE....which was so delicious.  I can hardly wait to return to order more.  What made this so good was the peas and carrots and onions in the rice were very tasty.  And, the shrimp was the perfect size added to the rice.  I devoured half of this for lunch.  Then the other half for dinner.  Grateful to the owners who made this delicious meal.< /text>

The sweet & sour chicken tastes like sauerbraten, with a bit too much vinegar. I've never seen that color red before except maybe on a beet. After chewing hard on all that dried out chicken my jaw look like Arnold Schwarzenegger's :)< /Text>

<text>This is such an awesome place just because it's a hut in the middle of a parking lot with plenty of shaded seating. It's also pretty cheap food for decent cheap Chinese food. They even take credit card!

What I like about the menu is that most items are about the same price, so you can really just choose what you want to eat. I got the chicken with broccoli, which came with either rice of fried rice. I opted for the latter. The portion is decent and I was satisfied at the end of the meal. The carryout is well-packaged and nothing spilled.

I think the only issue is that it took about 10 minutes to get my food, which is a bit long, but not too bad.<//text>< pics>

This is the cutest little Chinese food takeout place! The workers are always smiling and very friendly! The food is excellent! Some of my favorites are the sweet and sour pork, and the cashew chicken!  I highly recommend this place!< /Text>

They serve frozen food so they make it quick. Not great tasting. Only good food is their chow mein.<//Text>

It's fair to say that this place is a 'good deal' if you relate the quantity of food to the price.  However, I find the food here bland and without character, largely because of inadequate seasoning.  Also notable is that they use exclusively American vegetables (corn, mushrooms, carrots, green pepper, celery, broccoli) that are nearly the same in every dish.  You will not find any Chinese vegetables like water chestnuts, bok choy, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, etc. being used here.  The result is rather unimpressive Chinese food that is not really Chinese food!< /Review>

I would call this place a hole in the wall, but that wouldn't be entirely accurate. It's more like hole in the street--you can see it from afar, but you don't pay much mind to it and instinctively avoid it. There isn't much signage, and it is very unassuming in that old donut shop way.

That however has no bearing on the type of food that comes out of here, however. The tastiest egg rolls (and large, too), the most flavorful Mongolian beef, and the kung Pao chicken exist here. Definitely something to check out.<//text>

They are always so kind and friendly. The last time I came here, I saw they handed a homeless person a cup of water who then immediately continued on his way. Such friendly service deserves a good review. The food is your typical take out Chinese food with huge portions. I love their extra garlic-y chow mein, but when I say extra garlic-y I mean extra GARLIC-y. I usually order the #3 combo: sweet and sour chicken with chow mein and fried rice. I can easily split it into 3 lunches so I end up spending less than $3 a day for lunch. There is plenty of parking, but no public restroom. Most people take out but there are tables if you want to eat there.< /Text>< Resp>

<text>This is important, call to order your food, ordering online it can get lost. I always get the drunken noodles with duck with mild heat. Absolutely insanely good! Great portion size and flavor for the cost. Good people running this restaurant, let's keep them running!< /text>< Pictures>

Call them up if you have some exclusions or inclusions .. better than giving online instructions.. they were helpful in accommodating our exclusions.. great thai food and flavors. You get 1 thai tea free for orders 50$ and more. Check  for latest offers< /Review>

Might be the best Thai food I've ever had... Not that I've been to Thailand or anything, but it was fantastic.  I had a simple meal, panang curry with a side of Thai dumplings. I will definitely be going back for more< /text>

Delicious yet pricy. Probably due to location. When you open at the foothill of San Diego's wealthier area, you're gonna run into this.<//review>

From what I saw, currently not open indoors for dine-in. Service here is a little slow when I normally dine in, but the staff are very polite and attentive. The food here is also fantastic. Can definitely recommend the angel wings, the mee krob, the pad thai, the pad-see-u, the drunken noodles, duck over spinach, and the garlic pepper wings. Honestly, every time i've been here I have tried a new dish, and it has always been flavorful, filling, and delicious.

Definitely come here if you want good Thai food. Also, their mango iced tea is ridiculously sweet and delicious.< /review>

<Review>***update: the food is now almost as bad as the service, and the service is seriously the worst I've ever gotten anywhere. Even to go orders are impossible to get in a reasonable time. What a shame.... someone needs to open a decent Thai place in the neighborhood. This place needs to go out of business. In honestly surprised it hasn't already.***

The food is almost always good,  and usually fantastic. We've been eating here for 12 years. The past 5 years or so, the service has been getting progressively worse. They really need more people on the floor: a hostess, a designated to-go order person, an extra server or 2 during rush hours...It's sad because we love the place. We still get take-out regularly,  but we won't dine in anymore. It's just too painful.< /Review>< pics>

Pad See-U was good. Pad Tai was not very good. For being nearly empty, the service was terrible. Redeeming quality was the ambiance. We were very impressed with the decorations and atmosphere. Probably won't be coming back.</review>

Flavorless yellow curry, no spice even though I asked for medium.

Bland, no developed flavors.</review>

The staff is not friendly. I asked a girl about the different noodles there are on the menu and she said " just look at the menu"...short and rude. Food is underwhelming, no plastic forks, napkins included in takeout..Shrimp was chewy cardboard, no seasoning on the chicken. Utterly disappointing</Text>

<Time>1517355457600< /Time><Review>I had the pineapple fried rice. It came in a scooped out pineapple. Very interesting way to display the plate. The Golden Triangles was our appetizer. They were crunchy, but not greasy and came with a very wonderful tasting sauce. One friend  had the red curry, the other had spicy Drunken noodles. Everything tasty and devoured. I would definitely recommend this place. Great friendly service too.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80dbfbc689be7f33:0x8a94df496b1da79c< /gmap_id><user_name>Carol Wasowski</user_name>< Response>

The food is delicious and they have great entree selection for lunch starting at $9.99. Best deal in town!<//Text>< gmapID>

The only downside really is the Pad Thai is so good here I simply do not enjoy Thai food from anywhere else. This is now my go-to home for great Thai food. For those wondering, the Beef Pad Thai extra spicy is a must try.<//Text>< Pictures>

I noticed a significant difference in quality, it went from some place I have gone here with my family for years to somewhere I will not go again for a significant amount of time to see if anything has changed. They use plane white napkins instead of the cloth ones they used to, maybe they were an added expense so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. However this does not excuse poor service by the hostess/waitress and food of subpar quality. Long wait for drinks, food and to even take our order. I can excuse the food time because we came on a Tuesday and they were likely not prepared for the volume of food ordered but not the food's quality.< /text>

For the area it's a bit of the only option, so it will work in a pinch if I'm craving Thai for lunch since it's close by, but they don't open until 11 and as my lunch starts at 11 and they won't take orders ahead of time, they won't really get my business or anyone with the same lunch period who wants to get back to work in time.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80dbfbc689be7f33:0x8a94df496b1da79c< /GmapID></record>

Our favorite Thai restaurant. We have been there several times to eat with no service problems like mentioned in other reviews. We have also ordered takeout with no issue.

We have eaten, several appetizers and entrees. The green curry is my favorite (with shrimp is really good) and the red curry is my husbands favorite.< /Text>

This is not one of my favorite places to visit primarily because of the service. I asked for mild spice. My husband asked for medium spice. His was probably the equivalent of mild and mine had no spice at all. The first time we came here we really enjoyed the service and the food. I can honestly say since then it has gone downhill and continues in that direction.</review></record></dataset><record>

One of the worst services ever ever in San Diego. We reached the restaurant at 8:50PM and they told us the kitchen is closed. In that case why the hell should you have timings open till 9:30PM. A restaurant with bad attitude workers is not going to go far.<//Review>

Nice place and good decor, the food is good too, and they ask you how spicy you want the food to be. Good ambience.< /Review>

The food is REALLY Good but the staff not as friendly as one would hope - If they work on better communication and engaging is small conversation with patrons they will have it all. Maybe there is a language barrier that prevents them from being as friendly as accustomed to at other places? Again.. I really like the food...<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Great food, but their 10 spicy isn't spicy enough for me. The waitress was very polite. Service was somewhat slow, but it was worth it.</Text>

We ordered drunken noodles which was exchanged by another table and we did not get a replacement, where as the other table got one. They where not even crowded to mess up orders. Noodles where burnt and so was the chicken. Paid for bad service and bad food very disappointed with this place.< /review>

<user_name>Adam McDowell<//user_name><review>Lived in San Diego for 16 years.  Takhrai Thai has, bar none, the best yellow curry & Pad Woon Sen.  Must be excellent wok hei in that kitchen to achieve such distinguished flavor in the Pad Woon Sen.  Would love to see how it's prepared & cooked as my own doesn't hold a candle to theirs!<//review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>This is an excellent Thai restaurant.  I'm expecially fond of the Drunken Noodles, and the Panang Curry is not to be missed.  I think this is the best Thai option in the area.<//Review>< UserId.>

Very nice and clean place. The staff was very friendly with explanations on her recommended choices. The price is relatively fair. This place is not considered cheap and quick takeout food. Average lunch/dinner meal will be somewhere between $12-$15. Most importantly the food was DELICIOUS!!</review>

Before today's visit we were there maybe a month ago. At that time, we tried Breakfast menu and was good.  Today we tried lunch menu, it was so so. My dish pork meat was not so fresh, kinda tasted old to me. My husband didn't like the cheese in side of stuffed chili .
Salsa bars were very good.  I love spicy food and they had really good ones and my hubby liked mild one.  Most likely we'll go back Tuesday's for their Taco specials.
I am very picky person, perhaps you find out your own.< /Review>

Its the best Mexican Food you can try. The tortillas are hand made your food is made on the spot it's not frozen. They have the best authentic menudo in town.< /Text>

My mom and I go here for late night nachos!

Super tasty.

We get the chicken nachos, lots of melted cheese, though, not as much as I would want, lots of grilled chunky chicken, lots of veg, a few slices of avocado, fresh tomato salsa, pickled veg. And nicely crisp tortilla chips. mmmmmmmmmmmm

Last night Mom had a particularly long day at work, so we were kind of tired and loopy. I'm just over a cold.

We walk in and there is a smartly dressed man at the register, Rick. He greeted us as we walked in, and we got to chatting about so much randomness. Nachos, horchata, and an in depth conversation about veganism and cow tounge... yeah, that was a weird turn... he had a bag he brought to my mom at the salsa bar, put the salsas we selected into the bag for us as we started heading out.

Dude was nice.

Hell, each time we come here the staff is friendly.

And the nachos are tasty. I really should try some other stuff, pics of the chiliquillies look really yummy. And signs say $1 street tacos on Tuesday.</text>

Came here today with the whole family for Father's Day, all I can say is I was disappointed and unsatisfied with my food. I ordered a carnitas torta and for the price it was fairly small. My plate consisted of literally 10 tortilla chips and the torta. Besides the drink. The meat itself had no flavor, hat being said the fries I stole off of my sons plate were decent. I didnt try anything else because the torta just killed it for me. I don plan on coming here anytime in the near future. For now I'll stay away.< /Text>

I have no complaints Sometimes there are many people who say they do not like their food and do not know what. But do not let those bad comments make you feel bad. Keep going, many times they say they never come back. But that's a lie, if they return. Really very good tacos. And they are not far from where I live. That's why I like them to be close.

(Translated by Google) It was not what I expected, on Instagram it looks good but already being there it is not the same, I asked for a pozole and because they gave me more broth than grain or meat and it is annoying to be stopping by the lemons and radishes and the oregano hopefully they will improve another moment go and surprise me

(Original)
No fue lo que esperaba, en Instagram se ve bien pero ya estando ahí no es lo mismo ,pedí un pozole y pues me dieron más caldo que grano o carne y es molesto estarte parando por los limones y rábanos y el orégano ojalá mejoren talves en otro momento valla y me sorprendan<//review>

There are a lot of Filipino restaurants around. I guess the item are customized to popular demands? There was a huge water spill, almost like a flood near the fresh meat area when I was there (late around 7PM). For that reason, I'm taking a star off.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80857351f4f9ed6b:0x5a94e6c9c3984ce9< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Make sure you go when it's off peak because it gets crowded esp on weekends. I don't see them controlling in and out customer traffic and the grocery aisles tend to fill up.< /Review>

Needs to be said- if you can't handle the smell of fish, Seafood City isn't for you. However, if you want a HUGE selection of fish, meat and Asian delicacies, there is no better place in Vallejo. Filipino, Chinese, Japanese, Thai etc... whatever you're in the mood to eat, they probably have it.</Review>

Great assortment and quantity of fresh seafood.  Lots of snack foods and packaged sweets, dessert and candy, noodles, and ramen.

Asian market with emphasis on Phillipino foods.  Found ube jam which is difficult to get from other Asian markets.

Assortment and quantity of fresh produce wasn't as good as I'd hoped.  Most of the produce looked sad, old, wilted, lesser quality.</text>

the store is always packed with great food and a nice staff that always helps you find what you are looking for. Good fresh fish and veggies that you cant find other locations</review>

<Review>Shrimp cooked with the heads and whiskers has a completely different flavor, they're sold there. Sometimes live BLUE crab which I prefer Dungeness crab. Whole fish and quality seafood 2nd to catching it yourself obviously. If you like Asian food and Filipino women, hang out there or maybe even apply and you get what your after.</Review>< gmapID>

<review>We used to go here more often but the meat counter takes so long and the vegetables seem to need to be better cooled, a lot of fly around them. But it does have a useful selection of things you will not find in other typical grocery stores. Such as noodles sauces and fresh fish.<//review>< gmapID>

The supermarket has a nice mix of Asian items that cannot be found in the traditional Supermarket stores. Stores clean, the cashiers are polite, and the merchandise is nicely spaced. It's nice to see that it's not too crowded with trinkets and other low value items for no apparent reason compared to some other Asian markets. The only reason this gets four stars, is because some selections of the fresh produce that are usually present, may not be available. This may be of no fault to them, it may be strictly a seasonal thing. Perhaps there's not enough buying power from the small-market to be economically feasible.<//Review>

The fish they have is amazing I come here all the way from Santa Rosa for tilapia to make mojarras. 😋
I would give this place 5 stars but thanks to the Grill City inside's service I only gave it 4. The young simp didn't want to do his job, gave me attitude and took FOR EVER to hand me skewers that were already made and cooked. Ill never get city grill food again. Never ever.< /Review>

I hadn't been here in a few years. But decided to go with a friend. She was hungry, we got ignored. So we decided to go in and do some shopping. There are a lot of things that you don't see in average grocery stores. We only got a couple of things before deciding to head on out.< /text>

<Review>It's got a really good selection of fish, and good prices on produce. Lots of interesting Filipino specialty items that you won't find at Safeway.
However, you have to be *really* careful about freshness/quality here. I've gotten a really bad bag of mussels, and when I was there last week - there were cases of *really* moldy strawberries out for sale.</Review><gmap_id>0x80857351f4f9ed6b:0x5a94e6c9c3984ce9<//gmap_id>< Name>

I have to buy all the staples again after moving to my own place. They had the fish sauce and sesame oil I was looking for for cheaper than Amazon. I wish they had more Indian and Japanese foods, but having a good selection of Filipino and Thai foods is good. I've been sad that they don't have White rabbit and hi-chew candies right now.<//text>

<Review>Variety, variety, variety! Fresh and frozen  seafood, appetizers and game you won't find other places. Any kind of Asian sauce you desire. A grill in the premises for take-out meals and a bakery. Not much help for English only speakers is the only downside.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<review>Good store for Asians to shop...lots of their seasonings available along with large seafood market
Has items like household items, pot pans rice cookers, different style cookware, steamers etc. Location is good whole corner lots of parking, but still hard to.find parking spot. There are 2 Ares to eat next door each side for Philippine foods...on is walk and pick out your choices with tray...good hot variety. Inside store is another restaurant...order and eat at tables. Good food a little pricey to wait yourself..go try for experience of foreign foods. It's good and try by all means do try something called: Halo Halo...its so good. It's a dessert. Surprising, it is creamy, iced, sweet (not too sweet) and a surprise of flavors all new to an American's taste. It grows on you, trust me...when I visit, I always (always ) have a HALO HALO! ALSO a dish that's beef with noodles. Give yourself time to walk inside the store area. Enjoy..< /review>< pictures>

Seafood City Supermarket has gotten better over this years. I enjoy the food court, and bakeries at the Vallejo location. You kinda gotta go in knowing what you want and to look for it. Staff isn't much help looking for products.</Text>

The food is fantastic, great price for healthy or delicious options. Represents a small market which also offers clothes, deals, and food. An absolutely imperative that every store or market out there models themselves after their atmosphere because it is soothing and relaxing to be in.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I'm able to buy specialty items at really affordable prices. The parking isn't so great, as it's always busy. The best time to go is after 6pm.</review>

A little disappointed here. This supermarket did not carry Soy (bean) Milk. How can an Asian market not have Soy Milk? I mean, aren't most Asians are lactose intolerant? I thought it was an eye opening moment.  Oh wells, now I know.< /Text>

A good place to shop for fresh fish and oriental food staples. For the most part, prices are reasonable, but several items do not have prices marked, and you may be surprised at the checkout. Have visited here many times and will continue to go back.<//Review>

I love going here. The little restaurants are great and the variety of groceries can't be beat. Maybe my favorite thing, especially when I have visitors, is to have them check out the fresh fish. It's almost as fun as going to an aquarium. It's kinda cool seeing all of the different types of of sea creatures that I otherwise would never see. And the will clean them for you.</Review>

I cannot honestly rate the entire Supermarket because I only stepped into the front of it to see what they had in their Bakery. The cakes looked wonderful. And I was also interested in the street food Booth they had. That looked really good also. But I did not buy or taste anything< /review>

This is the best supermarket that I have ever shopped at in the United States! If you're looking for Asian international foods, look no further. Eggs from all around the world. Fish from sushi to cooked and fried.</review>

The chicken teriyaki sticks were good. In preparation for my trip to Shanghai I'm trying to get familiar with the street food. Looks like oil be brown bagging it though.<//Review>< Pictures>

If you have been to any other Seafood City then you will know what's up lol. Filipino grocery with a fresh grill inside serving all sorts of yummy stuff. Not a big grocery store but covers most of what you will need. Jollie Bee and some other favorite stores located next door. The parking lot is sketchy in the evening as there is alot of homeless and drugs in that immediate area. Lots of garbage in parking area as well.<//text>

Best for seafood & Asian in the area that I know of.  A great variety of whole fish.  Kind of like a smaller ranch 99. Vegetables seemed a lot less are smaller. The bathroom was disgusting.< /text>

If the area this place is in ever gets better, I will give them 5 stars. Right now it's hit or miss whether or not it will be ghetto.</Review>

Didn't have what I wanted and hard to get people to actually help you. I felt like they went out their way for the Asian people. But didn't really help me as a black male. But the third person I asked helped which is why I'm giving it 3 stars.</text>

It was Great too find a super market that carries all the many Filipino food products since our move from the City where there are many market's to choose from with reasonable prices.. not like Ranch 99 in Richmond which was disappointing<//text>

Not so clean as a stereotype of who it's for would follow, but thoroughly interesting and available sea food of many varieties for their demographic.</Text>

Seafood City is the best store with fresh and cookfish you can bring home, also thier vegetables has a wide variety. The only thing when u i reach the cashier to breakdown my twenty dollars she refused, her reason was she dont hve enough . My advise is "dont u(cashier) get enough to change before opening a cash register" too bad huh.< /Review>

I go there for all my seafood buys, they have a great turn over, so you know it's fresh, never had a problem. Good customer service, price right, and so many other choices, in addition to add to cyour meal, go check it out, you will truly be satisfied.<//text>

They have a great selection of fish.
Cons
Awful customer service: they refuse to accommodate a customer in any way besides the directions to the bathroom. I give you money; you provide me with customer service it is as simple as that. I wanted to purchase a swordfish steak that everyone was avoiding because of a small piece of bone attached to it. The rep. at the seafood section blew me off after I politely requested if she or anyone else could cut off the part of the bone on the steak. The rep, "You get what you buy" Me in my head, "Um nope I buy what I want to get." I removed the bone that would have raised the price. I then asked her to weigh it, bag it and tag it. She did so with disdain. I went through 5 reps before I could get to the assistant manager let alone the manager. She in short with a condescending smile said, "After you buy the fish we can cut off the bone." In capitalism as consumers, we need to stay vigilant. Sidenote: I spent six years in customer service.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80857351f4f9ed6b:0x5a94e6c9c3984ce9</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great deals in the fish and meat department. Mostly in the meats though. Chicken and pork, not too much on the beef side. Their fish selection is large and they cook your food too.< /Text>

Expired items, unhelpful employees and possibly a bit racist, too; I have seen them treat non-Asians/Filipinos disrespectfully compared to their own. Sadly, I am Filipino myself and I can't tolerate that kind of customer service to ANY person. What prompted me to finally type a review is because of an incredibly rude cashier named Nhieu T. Talks down to people who aren't their friends or co-workers. She wouldn't even help with small errors on their card reader. Please improve.<//review>

Just okay selection and prices. Was looking for fresh pea sprouts, and they didn't have them. They did have some decent Japanese eggplants on sale, though.< /Review>

Small and boring place compared to other SeaFood City.  Chowking's food quality is terrible.  No Crispy Town, only Grill City.</text>

<text>Chicken smells like bleach. Ground pork was all cartilage and fat. My brother's family found a rubber band in some bamboo shoots they bought that was repacked at the store. Male cashier is rude and seems like he doesn't want to be there. 2 stars because they have decent whole fish and seafood. Produce is ok as well. Just stay away from the meat section.</text>< resp>

The rock crab that we bought today is not fresh , smell rotten . After I steamed it for half hour  open in up for dinner , meat is not formed  . I catch & cook crab all the time , this not fresh. The meat  is soft like potato . The sign says live & fresh crab. That is misleading consumer I paid I paid 16 .36  cashier Jenny Pearl Feb19, 2017 at 2:40:58 pm. How can I get a refund</Text>

<Text>Aside from having a great choice for Filipino and Asian dry and wet goods,this place is a zoo. From people trying to park all over the place to loud music blaring from busted and distorted speakers, tight aisles to abnoxious and idiotic customers.Bonus- Valerios Bakery, if you're craving pan de sal and other Philippine breads and delicacies, this is the place to go.If you're craving Philippine fast food, Chow King and Jollibee are in close proximity.<//Text>< pictures>

Please check your products before putting in display. My friend and I bought this last 8/28/2O17 and had an upset stomach few hours after we ate this. We were shocked when we saw that the expiration date was three years ago!</Text>

< review>
Employees in the meat and fish department joking and laughing while I waited for over 30 mins for my fish to be cleaned and it wasn't even that busy.  Had to ask cashier if I had any rewards. She was not very polite. I had no bags but a lot of groceries and she asked me how many bags I needed. I said however many bags need for my groceries and she gave me a mean look.<//review>

Clean, but many products are very over- priced. Employees are nice, depending on what time you are there sometimes fish counter service is too slow.</text>

<review>The seafood city sm is probably a good place to shop but I wood not let your wife take karate classes at cabiles kombatan  arms karate school inside the market the , instructor George cabiles was supposed to teach my wife of 30 years karate he   did but then he took it a  little bit to far I caught him and  my wife doing things that a karate instructor and student should not be doing I always  thought if you were going to mentor student you couldn't be in a relationship with them at the same time I may be wrong so I think George Cablies of kombatan arm  does not have what it takes to tech  karate he has no morals and no respect for the art what you did was wrong George and you know that it was wrong</review>< Pictures>

<text>Too many days of smelling the fish across the parking lot...
Too many times of being over charged by over zealous checkers who don't hear the beep of the computer...
Too many times of seeing 1 price on the shelf, and being charged a different price.
Too many times of buying dairy, and having it go bad within a day or two, or seeing dairy that was past the expiration date.<//text>< pics>
