Super chill Ramen spot near the theater with delicious world class ramen.

They allow you to do a noodle top-up if you’re extra hungry. Medium spicy was the perfect kick on broth. Was a ton of food! Next time I might go for the veggie ramen and just add an extra egg. Yum!< /Text>

We’ve been here twice now as a family of four, and have been very pleased with the hospitality and the food both times. The ramen is absolutely delicious and I appreciate that they offer spice on the side so I can share a bowl with my stepdaughter and kick my portion up a notch. All the staff are very friendly, and outdoor dining is great!</Review>

<text>My review is based on a togo order. The eatery is very upscale it they do not seem set up well for takeout orders.  The ramen and pork belly appetizer were delicious and packaged well for takeaway but the all the fried food I ordered was not packed well for take home. The leak-prof containers are air tight and trap in all the steam. I live 10 minutes away but the food would have been ruined as soon as the lid was closed. It is common sense to pack fried food in a container that is vented to let the steam out. I ordered 3 fried dishes at 8 dollars each so I wish the manager or chef would have been more knowledgeable about packaging fried food.< /text>< Pics>

Love the Marufuku in SF and so excited they're now in RWC. Ramen and appetizers are amazing. I've eaten there weekly since I found out they opened here, and quality is great every time. They package the food very carefully for takeout: broth, toppings, and noodles are kept separate. Service is very kind, and ramen is ready in less than 15 minutes after you call. Marufuku forever!!!!!!!!!<//Review>

We came to the grand opening for Marufuku Ramen in Redwood City, and it's a great addition to the family of Marufuku restaurants! If you enjoy Marufuku in San Francisco or in Oakland, then you know to expect one of the best ramen spots in the Bay! As you walk in, you are greeted with some of the friendliest staff. The interior is elegantly decorated, and the outdoor provides plenty of space for a group setting. The food came out in less than 10 minutes and was the perfect temperature. We ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu and the Chicken Paitan DX. The broth for both ramen were phenomenal and the noodles were so fresh! The Chicken Paitan DX comes with a enormous piece of sizzling chicken so make sure you're hungry for that. All in all, the price was very reasonable for the amount of food you get. I can't wait to come here again!< /Review>

I ordered the hakata tonkotsu ramen for takeout. The flavor of the pork was great, but the broth was a tad greasier than what I’ve had from other local ramen restaurants. The noodles were slightly undercooked and stuck together, making it difficult to eat. I liked that a boiled egg was included. Overall, this ramen was just “okay” — a good price, but nothing too special to see here.< /review>

<text>I enjoyed a dare I say perfect lunch here! Upon arriving I could tell the service team was operating as a healthy machine. Adding our name to the wait list was a breeze and I could easily track where we were in line through Yelp's app. Once our table was ready, the host took our temperatures before leading us to a nice picnic-style table in the back. Since it was our first time, he delivered a succinct and helpful overview of the menu items and named the server who would be taking care of us.

It didn't take long for us to choose our plates:
Marufuku bites
Kakuni bowl
Hakata tonkotsu deluxe

Bravo! I savored every bite of succulent pork, whether it be sandwiched between two fluffy buns or marinating in mouth-watering broth.

The buns were such a fun starter I wanted a dozen to take home for later. The filling was evenly distributed and I loved whatever sauce sat drizzled on top. I ordered my ramen medium but requested extra spicy on the side and it was perfect. The noodles were soft and tender, the pork melted in my mouth with every bite and the menu description of a "rich" broth didn't disappoint.

Another touch I appreciated were the dishes; each and every bowl / plate / sauce dish was beautiful! Stylish pottery serving up slices of savory heaven in a clean, socially distanced space was exactly what I needed on this Saturday.

Will be back and definitely a new go-to recommendation!<//text><Resp>None<//Resp>< userid>

The place is so pristine, the food is delicious and the service is excellent! If you like Ramen, I would definitely recommend you to try Marufuku Ramen. They even have a great vegetarian option in case you don’t eat meat, which is not the case for many ramen places. It’s also really well located if you just come to visit Redwood City for the day. Enjoy!<//Review>

<review>The best Ramen my teenage sons and I have ever had. Absolutely delicious! We tried a medium spicy and a lightly spiced Hakata Tonkotsu along with a medium spicy Chicken Paitan. All three dishes were perfectly seasoned and beautifully prepared. We also had the Chicken Karaage and the Geso Fry, squid legs. Crispy, tender, and flavourful with a lemon wedge and a well-assembled dipping sauce. The service is impeccable. It's abundantly clear that the entire crew and management take great pride in the experience they provide. We can't wait to be back soon!</review>< Time>

Note on the spicy levels:
1. Mild is with a hint of spice, good for the first-timers.
2. Medium is okay, it's closer to mild in other place.
3. Spicy is the level for those who enjoy the 'bite'.

Awesome staff here, everyone is friendly and very accommodating.

Initially tried to come on Tue, found out last minute, they're close Mon-Tue. Stopped by on Wed, tried the pork ramen... yum!!! Owner even responded to my 5-star post without review. This is a personal level of attention is what separates the great business from the rest. :)

Fast forward to today... my co-worker and I have decided after our lunch yesterday that we'd be back. So we did! And we tried the chicken ramen, which I like even better.

Two 5-star days on the row. I'll definitely be back. Maybe tomorrow? :)</Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>We have been waiting for Marufuku to open since a few months ago and last night it opened, yay! Not only is Marufuku one of the top ramen places in the Bay Area, it's special because it was our first date <3

Having had plenty of Orenchi in the past few months and not much other ramen, we have forgotten what really special ramen tastes like. The tonkotsu broth was rich, savory, and flavorful. It's a more intense flavor than other tonkotsu ramen I've had. The chicken paitan was less intense but has a rich chicken flavor. It's definitely the lighter of the two broths. The chicken chashu was amazing - perfect texture and not dry.

Other than the broth, the star is the egg. It is a perfectly soft boiled egg with a gooey center. Of ramen places we have tried, Marufuku has the best egg!

Highly recommend!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>It was awful and disgusting, timing was terrible and the ramen was hard and stuck together there was barely any noodles. The service was awful and it took us 40 minutes just for our food. As well as it’s unorganized and it’s a whole mess. When I decided to speak to the manager all he asked was if they can take my order after waiting for 50 minutes. It was a horrible first experience and I will NEVER go back there even if I was starving 50 dollars was not worth the money for me and my friends.</Review>< Pics>

I ordered my ramen to go and unfortunately it came out very undercooked. The chicken also felt undercooked and rubbery. I was not satisfied with their customer service either, the woman serving us was quite snappy.</Text>

Exceptional Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen and Tori Paitan (Rich chicken broth) ramen! My order was Tori Paitan DX with Cha-syu rice bowl. I would have skipped the rice bowl if I knew the whole chicken leg comes with the DX ramen, but all pieces were so great, the chicken is well marinated with teriyaki sauce, and Tori Paitan broth is so rich and deepened with butter and corn, so yummy!< /text>

<text>The lady at the counter was very rude to my friend who was waiting for 30 minutes on line only to be told that they were too backed up on orders to be served. When I was served, the ramen felt and tasted like a microwave ramen bowl I can get at Costco for three bucks.

<text>Customer service was excellent and the food exceeded my expectations. We ordered the extra spicy and medium Hakata Tonkatsu, not the DX and Marafuku Bites. The broth was delicious, the noodles were cooked to perfection and the soft boiled extra large egg was very soft on the inside. It literally busted open as I softly cut into it, the yolk coated the top layer and I stirred it in my broth. I'll be coming back for sure. Ask for extra spicy on the side to add in your broth if needed. The Marafuku Bites were flavorful and the buns were soft as can be. Next time I'd prefer less mayo.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I took my truck here and got the five year warranty paint job.  I should have taken the time to write this review then.  What a mistake that was.

Over spray was everywhere.  Lights, all trim & moldings, bed liner, springs, shocks, frame rails, fuel lines, etc etc.  They painted my electric AMP side steps and even got white paint on my interior!  I had a deadline to be elsewhere so had to bring the truck back to get it fixed.

Three years later the paint is flaking off near every piece of trim, fender wells, bumpers around the doors and much more.  They are so horrid I won't go back there regardless the warranty.  I have a lot more photos but these should give you the idea.

Don't Go MAACO - I should have known better......< /Text>

<Date>1618294515043< /Date><rating>1< /rating><text>Major disappointment. Paint turned out ok but they got red dust inside my truck from sanding and red finger prints on my headliner, armrest and seats. They charged me extra to fix a small dent and did a poor job. They made no effort to clean it before I picked it up. Not even sure the used primer before they painted it because all of the over spray is red. And it is everywhere. Yet no grey over spray can be seen. To top it off they rubbed my brand new tires against a curb and damaged the raised white letters. Very irritating at $315 a tire. Promised to have the job completed in 4 days. 11 days later after many visits and phone calls I got my truck back. And all they had to paint was the top and the hood. Do yourself a favor. Pick up some cans of spray paint and paint your car yourself. You will save yourself a lot of time and aggravation. Next time I need something painted This shop won't be on my list. And did I mention they never did offer to have my truck detailed. Poor business practices on there part.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>They did a great job on blending the color on the roof of my truck spot on. I was happy about that. I was not happy about all the scratches that were made on my doors I don't know how it happened but they were definitely not there when I took it in hopefully it buffs out and they were careless about cleaning up after the job.I didn't really care about all the sand paper in the bed of my truck but I did care about the hand prints and such inside my truck. Other than that not a bad paint job.< /Text>< Response>

Excellent customer service!! Will to negotiate amicably. Results exceeded my expectations but some details were overlooked and we considered when finalizing the price. Overall satisfied. Job was done when they said it would be done. I would come back here again for business and refer people for sure.</Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I was recommended this place to repaint my diffuser and bumper on my Volvo C30. For a very good price they painted both and it’s a ~95% match to the original. It looks beautiful and comes with a 5 year warranty.  I dropped the bumpers off and they were done the next day. Definitely recommend to anyone needing repainting services.<//text>< pics>

I must say the overall experience was interesting my first time having to take my car to a paint and body shop for repairs and Candy one of the customer service representative was very knowledgeable she examined the damage examine my car she knew already what to fix and what parts to order I must say I wish the wait time for the work to be completed could have been done sooner but I must say they took their time did the work professionally and the work was done in a timely fashion my car looks fantastic I'm very satisfied Thanks Candy and the body repair guy never met him👍<//Text>

I took my truck here and got the five year warranty paint job.  I should have taken the time to write this review then.  What a mistake that was.

Over spray was everywhere.  Lights, all trim & moldings, bed liner, springs, shocks, frame rails, fuel lines, etc etc.  They painted my electric AMP side steps and even got white paint on my interior!  I had a deadline to be elsewhere so had to bring the truck back to get it fixed.

Three years later the paint is flaking off near every piece of trim, fender wells, bumpers around the doors and much more.  They are so horrid I won't go back there regardless the warranty.  I have a lot more photos but these should give you the idea.

Don't Go MAACO - I should have known better......</Review>

I called again 3 days later for an update and the lady said she would check and call me back. I called again 2 days later and she said she will call me back in 10 minutes.  After 2 hours and no call, I called again. She said it’s almost done. I finally got a call 2 days later from the office guy, he said it would be done Friday. I picked the car up on Saturday. I’m ok with it taking longer than expected but it would nice if they kept me informed with a simple text. The work was was ok other than some over spray on the belt moldings which we were able to remove at home.  In summary, the work was satisfactory but I expect to be kept informed vs me having to call several times for an update.< /Review><Response>{'time': 1594237312571, 'text': "We're sorry for the wait and inconvenience, Darren.

Took my 2009 Ford Flex in th have the hood painted and was told it may take 2-3 days for the work to be completed.  Cindy, the Maaco representative was awesome. Gave me a price to have my hood painted I could not refuse. My car was done the next day which a very pleasant surprise to me. If I ever need any parts of my car painted, I will make sure to go to Maaco in Rancho Cordova right away.< /review>

The folks at Maaco did an amazing job getting me a perfect paint match on my camper shell to match my truck.  They quoted me on when it would be done and met the deadline.  Super nice folks that do a great job.</Text>

<text>Met with Steve the owner.  Discussed what I'd like done. Steve gave me some options.  I chose the single stage application.  He then proceeded to take me to the shop to show me different vehicles that each had the available painting options.

I wasn't expecting anything fantastic, but my 20 yo Integra came out looking better than expected.  Yeah there was a little overspray.  Yeah the interior was a little dusty.  There was one small section where "too much" paint or urethane coating was applied causing a slightly noticeable imperfection in the finish.

In my untrained eye, I think they performed an exceptional job. Paint matched perfectly with original paint.  I didn't pay for a "custom" paint job and didn't expect "perfection", but it seemed pretty darn close.  My car doesn't look like new, b/c it is 20 yo.  But my family and I are quite pleased with the outcome.  Steve and his office staff and paint/prep crew were definitely professional.  I'd use them again.< /text>< Gmap_id>

Paint was peeled off and cracked after 4 months of getting it painted and they refused to fix it claiming that it was not their fault and blamed it on the customer. They claimed it was one year warranty. Terrible service and conducted business with poor ethics. Be careful, don’t go here.<//Review>

A guy name Spencer that helped me told me that they changed ownership since my car was originally painted, and that since it was almost at the end of my warranty, I would have to pay half the cost to have my car re painted. I informed him that I was not told that I had to pay a pro rated amount for warranty work, when I first had my car painted. He showed me a copy of the details of the warranty. We negotiated an amount we agreed on, which was $300. I made a reservation to bring my car in the following Monday. I asked if it could be done by Wednesday, he said it could take 3-5 days. He said he will try a have it done by Wednesday and will give a call me when it was done. On Wednesday by 3pm I haven’t heard anything, so I called and Spencer said my car was done. I got there and my car was completely covered in dust. I couldn’t hardly see the paint job because it was so dusty. I asked Spencer why my car wasn’t cleaned or detailed? He said it had been sitting out all day, and it got dirty from dirt from a nearby field. I looked at a van, and another car, which was his car, and they weren’t dirty at all. When I asked him about it, he said his guys washed his car. I told him there was no wind blowing, and I don’t believe that much dust which appeared to be dust from other cars that were sanded accumulated on my car from the field. I told him this was unacceptable and I can’t even see the paint job. He told me his guys have left. I told him he needs to do something, because I’m not accepting this. I also noticed my emblems haven’t been put back on either. He got my emblems and put them on the car, and got a wet and a dry cloth and started wiping down my car. I got my cloth and started wiping my car, so I can get it done and get out of there. There’s a cover that’s over part of my sunroof, where I noticed two of the screws and brackets that hold them in we’re missing. I told him about it, he looked but couldn’t find them. He said he’d knock $50 off the bill, and I agreed. I found overspray in several areas, which he removed. I seen where it looked like some debris got on the car while being painted. He said it looked like some chemical reactions. He said he’ll take of $100 from the bill. I told him ok, because I just wanted to get out of there. I don’t know if they purposely left my car that way, because of the amount he charged me, or if his guys neglected to complete the job. Even though he worked with me on the price, I was very dissatisfied with the overall experience, and I don’t know if I’ll ever go to a Maaco again. I know I won’t be going back to that one.<//review>< Pictures>

The car has been restored to looking absolutely new. The quality of the workmanship is excellent and, in addition, interior and exterior detailing were done, something I’ve not found at other body shops. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this Maaco facility.< /Text>

<Review>Single stage paint 1 yr later without being garaged still looks awesome. Excellent taping and masking. They allowed me to do all body work and priming myself so all they did was mask and paint which matched my budget for this 20 yr old Sentra which still looks great for low $$. Excellent communication and kept to their promised schedule. Definitely would choose them again but would pay the extra $100 for their priming since my priming colors show through their color coat a bit.</Review>< Rating>

<Text>Maaco painted the outside of my 1989 Jeep Wrangler YJ. They did a great job, from the taping and prep work through the painting and cleanup.

Candace in the front office was helpful, confident in Maaco’s abilities and professional. My son was so impressed with the work that he’s going to have his car painted by Rancho Cordova Maaco as well.  I will definitely go back to Maaco for paint work.< /Text>< Pictures>

<rate>1</rate><Text>I had my 2007 Toyota Camry painted at Maaco located in Rancho Cordova on Sunrise Blvd.  I went with their Urethane + Integrated Clear / Gloss package with a 4 year warranty.

First and foremost, this has to be the worst experience I have ever had in anything.  Mallory from Maaco called me to pick up my car and that it was completed.  When I got there and inspected my car, I notice there were still some tapes that were not removed, the interior which was clean when I dropped off the car was now filthy with paint and dust from them working on the car, headlamps were overspray taillights were scratched up from the sanding, and two cracks about one inch long on the top panel above the back passenger door.

When I informed Mallory, she said this car was probably not QC (quality check).  At this point, Mallory said she could not do anything for me and I would have to take this up with the manager.  She goes in and the owner of the shop comes out to speak with me.  This owner comes out with a look like he doesn't even care.  I asked him why the car was not QC as mentioned by his staff, Mallory before informing me to come pick it up when it was not ready.  He stated that it happens and shrugged it off.  I informed him of the issues listed above.  In regards to the filthy interior, he said this is not a detail shop and that they are a auto shop.  He said that there will be overspray with this type of work.  He also said that the scratches on the taillights and headlamps were unavoidable and the two cracks were due to previous cracks on the panel, which was a lie as there were no cracks there before.

Long story short, I was upset and did not accept his justification for the issues.  They kept the car one more day to clean the interior, they replaced both the taillights as it was not repairable, they cleaned up the front headlamps, and cleaned up some of the overspray.  They would not fix the two cracks and said it would cost me extra for them to do so.

They do not take ownership for their mistakes.  They have very poor customer service, but really great customer service when they are giving you a quote.  I do not recommend this place and hope that not all Maacos are like this.  I was totally shock to hear the things coming out from the owner's mouth.  He doesn't care about his customers.  After all this, they had the audacity to send me a text to rate and write a review on them.  So here it is.<//Text>< pictures>

My 2005 Toyota Tacoma truck needed new paint and also needed to be resurfaced as the clear coat and paint was cracking and fading. I was able to change the color for an additional $300. My total came in just under $1000 for the entire job which included: resurfacing, repair, and paint. If your looking for a basic job, like for a used car or work truck, this is the place to go. They did stellar work and will likely go there again!</review>

Just recently had my wife's car painted there. Service was lacking and they were short people to get it done. They had the car 2 weeks (told one week) before It finally got done the first time. Paint job had many problems and the work overall was sloppy. Brought it back so that they could look at it and it was agreed things had to be fixed. I was told to let cure and bring back in 2 more weeks, so I did. This time they were short people again so it took a couple days longer than I was told. By the time I got it back again I still found problems with it, but was told that was just the "Nature of the Beast" and would have to live with it. Overall with the money we spent to fix the dings and get it painted my wife and I were not happy with the experience  at the Maaco Sunrise location and would recommend going elsewhere.</Text>

I took my car to this place to paint, they told me 5 days but took them 9 days to get it done. And when I got my car I noticed the hood is uneven, after I told them they said they don't know how to fix it. Then I ask to see their boss and he was so rude and he said its a old car and I'm not gonna waist my time fixing it, things happens.< /review>

<review>Decided to try this place out as it's been saved on my map for a hot minute. I actually got 3 breakfast sandwiches as well as these donuts but we ate them too fast lol. So of those sandwiches we got a ham and bacon with egg and cheese on a plain bagel, sausage with egg and cheese on a croissant, bacon with egg and cheese on a croissant. We also got a dozen donuts, 2 apple fritters, and some apple juice from the fridge. My sandwich (sausage, egg, & cheese) was delicious. I finished it before realizing I didnt get a photo. I think the quality of the croissant really carried it because you could taste the croissant in every bite. The sausage tasted really good too. My 7 year old also enjoyed his bacon, egg, and cheese. My husband said his plain bagel was very basic. His said his was good, but it wasn't anything special. We were quite full after the sandwiches but managed to save room for the apple fritters. They were pretty good but still just apple fritters. I dont know about them being worth $2.50 each, I've definitely had same quality for less. The people running the shop were super nice though I'm pretty sure they over charged me a few bucks but its whatever. I wasn't given an itemized receipt to confirm. Overall, I'd definitely go back for another breakfast sandwich, the donuts are good, and they're clearly popular as customers kept coming in while I was there. The extra donut holes were a nice touch.<//review><Rate>4<//Rate><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzS3l0fhPuJVv-iJa1a0IaVchqvRS_MvGhlxTW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPJeE9Di-R2eZOTXLGeLDcb3NReFzF73FZ-wGQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< user_id>

<Text>This is a small place with friendliest people we have ever met who open at 4.30am. I have never been disappointed with any of their donuts but Heritage donut has made me such a great fan of glazed donuts which most of the time i have got almost freshly baked now i cannot eat at any other place. They do have decent coffee as well.
tips when you eat here:
1. You can always ask to get your donuts heated up if they are nit already warm
2. Let your coffee cool for a while else there is a chance you would burn your mouth n miss out on donut experience
3. Lastly always take 1dozen donut holes to go, trust me you will finish them.< /Text>< pics>

Family-owned donut shop with the yummiest donuts! The owners are truly some of the nicest people. I love the maple old-fashioned and the glazed cruellers. Last year they moved across the complex to where the Taco Bell Express used to be.<//text>

<Text>Good service. Donuts were not the best. I know my doughnuts/donuts. I’m a fat boy that’s eaten donuts every week of my life. Classic Glaze lacks that certain magic that’s so hard to explain for most. There should be a hint of citrus . Ever so slightly . Bearly enough to clearly distinguish. Butttt enough to know the difference in their techniques.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Proprietors are the nicest people and the donuts are some of the best I've ever had, bar none!  Try the apple filled bear claws or the apple fritters.  If you can find a better donut anywhere else I'd be surprised.  Their maple twists are also amazing.  We travel here from the Seattle area, home of the world famous Top Pot Doughnuts, so we like to think we know great doughnuts, and also donuts.  Heritage is at the TOP of the list!</text>

There was a shortly line at the regestration desk, but they move quickly. There's a short questionnaire to fill out. As soon as you have it filled out; the nurse escorts you the the vaccination area. The longest time I spent there was waiting the 15 minutes after you go your shot so they can make sure youre not having a reaction. Overall, it is a very smooth and quick process.<//Review></record>

<Text>Ordered a refill through my doctor. Got a message that it was available and if I wanted it mailed to let the pharmacy know. After waiting quite awhile to talk to a pharmacy  representative, told them that I needed the prescription mailed she replied that "it was in the mail". I was delighted that this had been already done. Representative was bright, cheerful and she made my day.

Took my son for a COVID test. A very kind man named Ike helped him. Ike was kind, gentle and considerate. My son was not an easy patient but Ike was outstanding in his sweet demeanor and empathetic tone with my son. Thanks for the great service!</Review>

Horrible horrible horrible!!  Nurse wouldn't assist with wheelchair up ramp. She said it was a liability issue. It's a fricken medical office - no one can help someone in a wheelchair?  Just wait until someone gets hurt...then you'll have a real liability issue and the stupid nurses will get fired.  What times we are living in!!</text>

Had a late appointment with radiology dept. The receptionist, Keisha, was AMAZING!! So friendly and nice and just an outstanding personality. I know its difficult in customer service based jobs to keep a smile sometimes, but she was just a gem. Definitely the best encounter I've ever had there.< /Text>

Just terrible service at this place. I came in for a prescription which I was told over the phone I could pick up at this location. I work nearby so I made sure it’d be ok for me to come here. I went during my lunch. Was checked in and I was told 15 minutes for my prescription to be ready. 20 minutes passed so I let them know it had been 20 minutes. I gave them my Driver’s license I’m guessing to verify it’s me picking up the meds. 10 more minutes pass by so I told them to give me my stuff back so I can go back to work. They walk me in to the pharmacy and tell me my prescription is at another Kaiser and they needed approval to bring it here. Not once did I updated about that or that it’d be longer. It would have been nice to know it was gonna take 45 minutes or longer right off the bat. I wasted my lunch waiting for nothing. Called member services to file a complaint, they placed me on hold and hung up on me. Just terrible service from Kaiser. In the past I’ve had good experiences with Kaiser. Today, at this location l, was not one of them. Don’t go to this location. Bad set up too. They have you waiting for your meds by an urgent care check in area. Sick people coming in while you wait for your meds.<//text>

We we're running a little late and was unsure if we were going to be seen. But they fitted us in and took care of all my daughter's needs and got her in some great glasses, in a very reasonable time frame. And the staff was very accommodating and very personable.a big thank you to everyone at the Kaiser optical care facility in La mesa .</Review>

< Review>
I’ve been a Kaiser member for over 30 years - well over 30 years - and I have never had a bad experience timewise with them. If you’re in a hurry, order your prescriptions online or by phone and they’ll be mailed to your home very quickly (you can’t do this with controlled medications like Vicodin but it’s a real timesaver since they say 7-10 days but it’s always much less.)
As far as waiting time to see a doctor that has never been an issue for me; it’s always been within 15 minutes and usually less.
My primary care doctors have always been great in listening to what I have to say and then talking over with me what they advise (‘using the smallest hammer’). I feel very safe with their evaluations.
As far as employees being rude or dismissive, I think that patients forget that they’re human too and that a friendly word goes a long way. Once a woman in line in front of me was so nasty to the check-in lady, knowing full well she couldn’t respond in kind,  that I felt I had to say something and I did. You have absolutely no right to abuse someone who is just doing their job. You get back what you give out and if you’re being rude or abusive you won’t be getting back lilies.</Review>

<Name>Evelyn Marie</Name><review>The older white male nurse at the Urgent Care check in is extremely rude. He didn’t acknowledge me at all when I walked up just stared and when I said my reason for being there he rolled his eyes and made a face then said well that’s the cause in a sarcastic tone. I was throwing up and he didn’t even give me a throw up bag he just rudely gave me the purple card and said go over there. Staff is always rude at this location and it’s annoying when someone doesn’t feel good and they one, act like they know what is wrong and brush it off like a whatever thing and two, the employee has some personal attitude and they take it out on us.

I went with my daughter who had a bad skin infection (MRSA).  They were very busy (Friday evening 8pm.)  It  took awhile to be seen by a doctor (2 hours).  But they were very efficient with their time, and yours,  once you've been seen. They were very informative and thorough during the visit.  I love how you can get your prescription filled at the same location right after your visit.  Usually my daughter would pay a hefty co-pay at the Urgent Care, but because we spoke to someone there about how high it was ($150.00) they asked her to fill out a form they gave her, and later, found out she qualifies for their $0.00 co-pay program because she's a full time college student with a qualifying income.  You have to re-qualify every 6 months but it was So Worth it!!  I would recommend to everyone (if they're having trouble affording their co-pays) to ask if there is a discount program they might qualify for.</text>

I've been coming to this office for 11 years now and it's the best Kaiser ever. Parking is always good and the wait is never long to see my doctor or my kids pediatrician. Also the lab is so quick as well as the radiology department and the pharmacy. Nice staff and great doctors and care :)< /review>

The pharmacy is the problem when you got a wait for medicine when you have pre- ordered it online and then you get there and they tell you it’ll be twenty minutes to twenty five minutes in the computer tells you when you have already ordered that it’s ready to be  picked up and you get there one is ready and the other one is not.And then they start making excuses I personally think somebody needs to come down and have a meeting and change their policy to make it better Because right now it’s not working. And they don’t care trust me on that one And the famous words they tell you I am  (sorry)</Text>

The entire staff at the Kaiser Permenente Medical Offices in La Mesa have always treated me very well.  I book my appointments online to see my regular doctor which is super easy and convenient.  I also appreciate the self check-in when I arrive.  If and when the wait times go beyond my appointment time, I always get an apology for the wait.  It's easy to talk trash about having to wait beyond an appointment time, but you know, that's just life sometimes.  I just assume that my doctor is extending the same courtesy to the patients before me, that he is extending to me.  He doesn't make me feel rushed at all and I appreciate that.  The lab seems to be very efficient and I've never had to wait long in there.  The pharmacy has quite a work load based on the number of people I usually see waiting, but again, I can't complain about that. I expect to have a small wait and it's never been more than 15 - 20 minutes.  For me, not the end of the world.  I can't speak for urgent care since I haven't had reasons to use it in many years.  I would recommend this medical office.</Text>

The glasses did not workout, i first called and let them know I'd like to return them and was told "no problem " . I get there and badgered to reschedule another appointment which i decided not to do,  after 15 minutes of arguing, I was told that a supervisor would need to authorize the refund, no supervisor was there to do so and Aaron, the name of the guy working there told me id have my refund that same day, I was not given my money back like I was told and no receipt was given to me, a form was filled out and i got zero documentation of the return. They currently have my glasses and no copy of anything, I had to take a picture of the refund form with my smart phone. I filed a complaint with membership services and even they are baffled at why i was not given a copy of my return, especially since they took my product and issued zero money back to me. Avoid this health care if you can.</Review>< pics>

<review>Pediatrics runs very efficiently. Always in and out within a reasonable amount of time and staff is polite and friendly. Same goes for the lab, the pharmacy can be a challenge at times but than again it serves a really big facility. Can't say much about urgent care tho, haven't really had the need to use it (thank god) except once but couldn't due to their unreasonable hours for an urgent care facility. I showed up right after 5 and they were already closed. Came to find out they open 8-5.<//review>< pictures>

<text>I just needed to go to urgent care; that's it. I get up to the front desk and immediately the woman was very impatient. For once there was no line. So why? Anyways I explained my problem and she completely ignored what I said began writing down On that purple slip something completely different. I let her know that was not why I was there. And she immediately went to say " then we can't help you. Maybe try the ER". I don't need the ER, just urgent care. I'm not here because I "want" to be here. I'm here for help.

Urgent care advised it would be a 3 hours wait. I'm fine with that. However, also was advised to wait in overflow waiting room. Listen for my name. When I heard it and made it to door, they had already went back inside.
5 seconds....
Then triage  nurse gave me attitude when I asked what happened. He said he walked over to waiting area several times calling me. Which was not true...sick people do not need this kind of treatment no matter how busy it is..3rd time I've had bad service at this location.< /review>

<Review>Everyone I dealt with at the La Mesa Radiology Department was wonderful.
Dr. Gerber is the best and his staff are kind and caring
young ladies that helped me from being so scared.
I just can't say enough good things about all of them. Debbie, the lady that does the mammograms is so nice and made me feel comfortable in a difficult situation. You are all wonderful and professional.
Thank you for everything.

<Text>I waited one hour and fifteen minutes to even get my name called. Then all they did was take  my blood pressure and kick me back into the waiting room.  About 15 minutes later they bring me back to a small room,  ask a few question, of which some of the listed information on my chart was incorrect and then I am given a hospital gown to put on. I sit there in a small box of a room for 1.5 hourse before a P.A. comes in.  He is in a rushed state, asks me what is wrong, but hardly lets me finish. He does a speedy, and I mean speady exam and does not even touch my shoulders and neck area where I said was some of the pain. When I begin explaining a little more since he did not address the whole pain area he stops me by telling me to listen to him. He cut me off! He was rather rude. After that I did not want to have anything to do with him.  The P.A. also said If it would make me  happy he would order an X Ray of my back. Very professional. The moral of the story is wait and get about 8 minutes and a curt rushing Physician's assistant who seems to not to take a patient seriously.  I won't be using La Mesa Urgent care again.< /Text>< GmapID>

<Review>I brought mom to the La Mesa Kaiser facility for a CT scan on 6/5/18 only to find out the GE scan machine was broken  The assistant mentioned they'd been having trouble with it all day  I'm wondering why they didn't have the foresight to call patients to give them a heads up? When you're elderly and on chemo, it takes a lot of energy to walk into the appointments. This was also a waste of gas and time.<//Review><user>100350074478847957076<//user>< resp>

I go to the La Mesa office for my annual eye exam and all contacts/glasses needs. This review is for the Optometry department as a whole because I always receive great service when I'm there. This experience in particular was exceptional. The annual exam was quick and easy and the wait time to see the doctor was no more than 5 min. Dr. Pham is super easy to talk to and answered all my questions and concerns. After the exam, I decided to come back to get my glasses as I pressed for time. When I came back the following week to order contacts and buy some glasses - Hannah and Lashonda helped me through the whole process. Hannah helped me choose glasses that I actually LOVE (for once haha) and I didn't feel rushed at all. I may or may not have tried on at least 20 glasses that day. After I finally chose some glasses, Lashonda really took the time to explain my benefits and guided me through that whole process. Thank you Hannah and Lashonda for all your help that day! It's greatly appreciated! It's because of this type of service, that I continue to trust Kaiser for all my medical needs.< /Review>

The check in front desk people are not knowledgeable and are racist especially the person Veronica who I overheard calling the security instead of the calling Carol the supervisor who I was waiting for 4 hours and she didn't show up at all.
As well as the doctor Daniel.sleig and his fat nurse who was my doctor totally avoided me because I was Black they asked me to wait until 8pm when my appointment was at 3pm. I work 7days a week, I took appointment and a day off to see the doctor I waited for 4 hours and didn't see the doctor and got another appointment. All because this person Veronica who is dumb and not knowledgeable calls the security and tells him to "scare him" while she was the person asked me to wait and I was not seen by anyone except the security who kept on telling me to take another appointment while I had no problem waiting.
Will not recommend this hospital to no one<//text><user_name>Kevin Ravikumar< /user_name>< gmapID>

I have always received excellent service from this office and am very happy with my doctor. The only time I was dissapointed was on my last visit, I checked in 20 min early, they had asked me to check in 15 min early, I waited the 20 min and assumed I would be called up soon after. I waited another 20 min after my appointment before I was called in. While I sat there waiting, I watched other people who came in after me get called in first. Either they were late and still got called up or they just forgot about me. After i was called in, the nurse took my vitals right away, then i waited for the doctor another 15 min. Alot of waiting around Bt I'm usually ready for that at any hospital or doctors office I go to, so I still give this clinic 3 stars because the staff was kind. I only wish they would have excused themselves for the wait time.</review>

Called to ask if I can still take Flonase even though my meds have changed. Got through to someone after 10 minutes got told that I needed to be screened by a nurse before anything could happen, was on hold another 15 minutes before I hung up then was promptly called back saying oh there's only 15 people in front of you. I told the guy that I was in the process of calling the pharmacy when he interrupted. I then proceeded to call the pharmacy which turned out to be a multi pharmacy phone number, then was promoted, "for my convenience, call this tool free number." I mean, how is that convenient? I just had to call another number and wait longer. I then sat on hold for about 20 minutes before I hung up again, trying to call another Pharmacy and it did the same f****** thing again. Call the toll-free number for my convenience. A f****** hour later and I still don't have an answer to a simple f****** question. Don't get Kaiser if you want to actually be treated. On top of all this, I have 5 bulging discs, a crushed L1, and severe spondylosis at L3 and 4. I am 20. They refused to do anything about it, short of injections that last all of two weeks and belittled me, as usual, saying, "oh you have MAYBE a 30 year olds back." that is utter BS. How many 30 year olds do you know that have these kind of problems? My 70 year old grandpa has a healthier spine than I do. Freaking pill pushers, man. Seriously, get anyone other than Kaiser.< /text>

Went yesterday morning and took a friend for his birthday. It was an absolute blast.  Terry was our pilot and was very easy going and knowledgeable about his city.  One of the best things I've ever done.  Felt totally safe and comfortable. Thanks for the experience.</text>

< review>
I booked a flight a week before my trip to San Diego. After reading all the reviews about Corporate Helicopters I seen Terry Frost The pilot was mentioned in almost every review that I had seen. And let me tell you, that man is one of the most easy going, funny, and entertaining pilots out there I’m sure. It was a blast! And also this was the first time me or my girlfriend have ever been in a helicopter and he was very professional and also well educated about the aircraft letting our first time ease the nerves for future trips. 10/10 definitely recommend coming to corporate helicopters if it is your first time flying or just for the good vibes!!<//review>

I took my girlfriend on this date as we had never been on one before and being blown away from the experience is an understatement. It is certainly an experience I recommend everyone to try at least once in their life!

Although the experience is worthy of five stars, I would say that it's a distant second to the experience and professionalism of our Pilot, Terry Frost. The man was enthusiastic, kept things light hearted, and was knowledgeable of all the history of San Diego's landmarks. Even being born and raised in San Diego, I learned so much and Terry's professionalism pushed the experience over the edge to be worthy of going back for more than once! 10/10 without a doubt! Thanks Terry and the CH team!

Best,<//Review>

<Text>One of the BEST experiences of my life. Terry, was great, extremely funny and made our experience one to remember. He even sang happy birthday!! Definitely recommend to anyone looking to get out of their comfort zone and experience the beauty of San Diego from up high. Can’t wait to book again.<//Text>< Pics>

<Name>Esvin Lima<//Name><Text>I decided to surprise the woman i love with the winery lunch that i combined with the romance package and it was incredible. Our pilot was terry. Through all the flights ive had, ive never had anyone more professional and informative as him. He was funny and kind and very knowledgeable about the city. Our flight to temecula was perfect with no issues. Our issue was timing and coordination with the Corporate helicopter and Callaway vineyard tour and tasting as the tour is only done at 11am and 2pm. So it should be something that should be hatched out since our flight left at 11am from san diego and we would leave at 2pm from the winery. But apart from that. Terry showed us am amazing view of san diego i have never seen and gave me and my gf and incredible memory we will never forget. Thank you guys<//Text></record>

<gmap_id>0x80dbffdb4b2dc953:0x941e7da46580bfe8< /gmap_id><Review>Terry was exceptional! I was surprising my then girlfriend to a helicopter ride /proposal to Callaway Winery. Corporate Helicopters has a fantastic relationship with Callaway Winery and everything was timed perfectly. Terry did an amazing job of hiding the secret of the proposal and destination until the decent. She had no idea we were going to the winery. The flight was comfortable with cold AC unlike other helicopters we've ridden. Terry was very smooth with his take off and landing. My now fiance was not scared with the flight and we enjoyed all the commentary and tour Terry provided. I was very intrigued with all the knowledge he had with San Diego County. The views of our flight was beautiful. The ride home by the coast was stunning. Highly recommend Terry and the winery tour they provide.</Review><Name>rendy tolo<//Name>< rating>

This was a beautiful experience and worth every penny! Terry made my family and I feel very comfortable and made us enjoy this experience even more! Not only is Terry hilarious, but you can really tell he loves doing what he does and he enjoys being around people! I would most definitely recommend and ask for Terry as your pilot!!< /text>

<text>Absolutely incredible experience. I booked a tour for an anniversary and was blown away from the second we walked through the door. Champagne and chocolate was waiting for us along with Terry, our awesome pilot. He made sure to take plenty of pictures and had a great sense of humor which made the trip that much better. I would recommend requesting Terry if possible. Our flight felt safe and was very informative. I’ve lived in San Diego my whole life and saw things I never had before.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPh3wEHcoCJtOCgBKz3p3h6fWoZjaGucR80RnVG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaAMBTyIHFm_lGtjg-O1VRzFscBaoWQtt6s0ll=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNONBAr-3aLLVGqJAowcoh7JEhmRWdVJJwny8DF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPv__Dbi19bX97C0vmx-_qJXMFDTFfdAo6Bbixx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80dbffdb4b2dc953:0x941e7da46580bfe8<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This opportunity was the perfect way to tie a little trip to San Diego all together. Our pilot, Terry, came in just for our booking and waited to take off to ensure the sun would be setting during our flight. He gave us a great tour of the city and kindly talked about many landmarks and/or places below. Since we had done a lot of driving to most of the sites, it was a really awesome experience to then see them high in the sky. Thank you to Terry and the extremely kind staff at Corporate Helicopters. They went above and beyond for me as a first time Helicopter rider!</review>

Terry was our pilot and was amazing at explaining locations, keeping the mood great and including us to not just be sitting in the back. Great sense of humor and very professional. Definitely one of the best experiences I’ve ever had and my boyfriend as well. Recommend 10/10<//Text>< Resp>

<username>Jesse Arvizu< /username><rating>5</rating><pictures>None< /pictures><Text>I booked a tour to surprise my girlfriend on her birthday and we both had an amazing time. Corporate Helicopters made the reservation super easy and we got in the air quickly.

We also had the pleasure of having Terry Frost as our pilot! He was extremely personable and brought a great sense of humor to the flight which made any nerves go away. Mr. Frost also knew a ton of historical, geographical, and insightful information which he shared with us along the flight. Mr. Frost not only made us feel safe and like we were having fun, but it is obvious that he genuinely enjoys etching this joyous experience into people’s lives.

Not only do I recommend flying with this company and if you have the choice, with Terry Frost as your pilot, but feel it is a MUST-DO to help one capture the entire essence of San Diego from a birds eye view. I have lived in San Diego for over 5 years and had not realized just how beautiful the city was.

Truly a amazing experience. Booked the romantic flight and I had kept it a surprise to my girlfriend and I was truly surprised on how they had it set up upon arriving. I didn’t expect the bottle to be chilled with chocolates, rose pedals in a heart shape and the sign with our names welcoming us. Truly amazing and friendly people our pilot terry was amazing and a lot of fun and has very good jokes. Will consider coming back to do their lunch and wine tasting flight sometime for sure. Again truly amazing and did so much better than I could ever except! Thank you guys for a amazing flight and experience!!<//Review>

Helicopter Tour with Terry
My partner and I make it our mission to explore each city we visit from above and love that view from a helicopter. While there are a handful of companies to choose from, the decision should end here. Corporate Helicopters is hands down our favorite. Not only did we feel like the tour was justified in length for cost, but our guide Terry was absolutely phenomenal. He not only made us feel safe, but he gave us an authentic perspective of San Diego. He was extremely quick witted and funny, and took note of different things we were saying to provide insight that resonated with us. When we landed we were also informed about the other side of Corporate Helicopters that works with the film industry and has some credits in films like TITANIC. Choosing CH is a no brainer, just book it!<//review>

<Text>I wanted to get my boyfriend a gift he would enjoy and remember for his 28th birthday. He was surprised, excited and very happy. We got the best customer service from the start even before we stepped inside the door. All the employees were very kind and accommodating. They even offered for us to come back for a second flight if the haze didn't clear up enough in the city. Thankfully it did and it was amazing. Our pilot Terry only made the trip so much better with his humorous, knowledgeable, and professional interaction. Our in-flight experience was so smooth and enjoyable thanks to the Terry's expert flying.  Hands down the best way to experience the city whether you are form the area or not. A second reservation is definitely in our near future! Happiest customer!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>What an amazing experience! I had booked the winery lunch and flight as part of my proposal to my now fiancé. Ivor made sure everything went as planned and accommodated everything I needed. This was our first time in a helicopter and our pilot Terry did such an outstanding job, smooth as can be! We already want to go on another ride!<//text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

We took our second Corporate Helicopter ride this week. Our pilot, Terry, was amazing and a lot of fun. They whole experience is great and the company is well organized and always willing to go the extra mile to accommodate us. The time before we had Marshall as our pilot who was equally as fun and helpful. I would definitely recommend them for any tours or charters you need!< /review>

Terry took us on a flight from Montgomery field to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park over to Torrey Pines down to Point Loma and across the city. He kept us entertained with great jokes and some really awesome views. I highly recommend taking this flight over one of the most beautiful areas in California.</Text>

<review>This opportunity was the perfect way to tie a little trip to San Diego all together. Our pilot, Terry, came in just for our booking and waited to take off to ensure the sun would be setting during our flight. He gave us a great tour of the city and kindly talked about many landmarks and/or places below. Since we had done a lot of driving to most of the sites, it was a really awesome experience to then see them high in the sky. Thank you to Terry and the extremely kind staff at Corporate Helicopters. They went above and beyond for me as a first time Helicopter rider!<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEnVOWF80HjtywdMl3kyn4AkZtYbp_FuHAKFum=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><name>Moriah Davidson<//name>< gmapID>

I have been wanting to do this for a very long time and I finally decided to book it for my boyfriends birthday celebration. I was very nervous but Terry (our pilot) made the experience fun, exciting and made me feel comfortable. My boyfriend and I loved the ride and couldn't have asked for a better time. Thank you to Terry and everyone at Corporate Helicopter for an amazing time and for being awesome all around. Will definitely recommend to others! Never change Corporate Helicopter, Terry, you are the real MVP !< /Text>

I booked the Diego Delight tour for my boyfriend's birthday and our route was changed due to a baseball game at Petco Park but our pilot Terry still made the flight so worth it! The view was fantastic and it was a great experience that I definitely recommend!<//Review>

<Text>Terry took us on a flight from Montgomery field to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park over to Torrey Pines down to Point Loma and across the city. He kept us entertained with great jokes and some really awesome views. I highly recommend taking this flight over one of the most beautiful areas in California.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Amazing experience! The whole team at Corporate Helicopters was great to work with as I set up a surprise tour for my fiancée. Our pilot Terry was relaxed and hilarious which settled the nerves for us first timers. He made the trip that much more memorable. Incredible views of the coast and downtown. Would definitely recommend!</Review>< pics>

<text>Corporate Helicopters is the only helicopter operator to use in southern California. From their competitive prices, excellent customer service and highly professional pilots to their top notch facility and maintenance / avionics staff they are a step above the rest. The owners are intimately involved in the day to day operations of the company and are always available to make sure you are taken care of. I've come across many helicopter operators that cut corners to maximize profits. You won't find that at Corporate, they are adamant about doing things right and providing a dependable safe service to their clients. Mandy their vice president of operations is lovely to work with and moves heaven and earth to come through with every request I bring her. Whatever your helicopter operation needs, Corporate Helicopters of San Diego has the experience and expertise to help you complete your mission safely and efficiently.< /text>< Pics>

This was the most amazing tour ever and I recommend it to everyone. Terry was the best tour guide who does a great job at making you laugh the whole time, it helps distract you too if you are nervous about going in a helicopter. The views were breath taking and Terry pointed out everything to you. If anyone wants a different view of San Diego and a fun trip, definitely go through here!! Might have to do it again sometime soon.<//review>

We had the privilege of doing a ride along with "Pilot Terry" who was exceptional in every way! Our flight was smooth, his narration was both informative and amusing – at times bordering on hilarious if I'm being thorough – and it was one of the highlights to our visit! I will add that I use a wheelchair which he was more than happy to accommodate and my impressions are that he will go out of his way to support and accommodate all who come to fly with him. Wheels up to Terry!< /Text>

I highly recommend corporate helicopters! The experience is definitely unforgettable. I started off booking with Adrenaline and they took forever to respond & ended up canceling. Then I stumbled on corporate helicopters and I'm so glad i found them & booked it. We celebrated my finances 35th birthday & we did the ROMANCE Tour. It came with Champagne, 30 min tour. When we arrived they had it all set up for us and I didn't expect them to have this setup. I mean Chocolate, rose petals, two custom champagne glasses and beautiful back drop where we took photos before the tour. We were lucky to have  an amazing pilot "TERRY" who took majority of our photos. Terry is really funny and kind. My fiance was really nervous about this tour and Terry did a really good job explaining everything to him and making him laugh.Thank you Terry for this amazing tour. We would do it all over again!</review>

Awesome San Diego flyover with informative commentary by our pilot. We chose to fly near sunset, which I’d highly recommend. The Robinson R44 was perfect for our group of three… got some amazing aerial photos of SD and area landmarks. CH provides professional and thoroughly enjoyable tour services. Many thanks!< /review>

First time at Corporate Helicopters.  I must say it was superb!  Everything from the reservation to the flight was easy.  Calvin in the front office and Pilot Terry were great and they helped willingly with a couple of requests.  My son was apprehensive to ride in front but Terry put him at ease and now he's hooked!  Prices are very fair as well.  Can't say enough good things.  Highly recommend the company and the experience!<//review>

I took my girlfriend on the 30 minute tour of San Diego and it was nothing short of perfection. The booking process was simple and easy, the price very competitive, and the pilot Terry was a blast and the best tour guide you could ask for! Highly recommend this to anyone who wants a great date idea or wants to see San Diego county from the sky!< /Text>

<review>Wonderful experience! My husband and I had the most awesome tour guide, Terry. Great sense of humor and very informative! We went in on a whim hoping to catch a ride...and they accommodated us so fantastically!

< Review>
What an amazing experience! We took flight with pilot Terry Frost to celebrate our anniversary. From start to finish the experience was wonderful. I booked online, which was a breeze, you are able to see all the flight packages they offer, where they fly and what the price is. After booking,I received an email confirmation and a second confirmation the day before our flight as a reminder. When we arrived they had a table set up with chocolates and champagne, rose petals were scattered on the table as well. The ladies at the front checking us in were welcoming and advised us our pilot was checking the helicopter and would be right in. Terry came in and introduced himself and asked if we had flown previously and had any questions. He served us some champagne and then off to do some final checks. We were taken to the copter in a golf cart and given some safety info, then with champagne in hand we were off. It's no secret San Diego is a beautiful city -to see it from another perspective and get a sweeping view of the cliffs at Torrey Pines, fly over our world famous zoo and see Padres stadium from high above was a truly amazing experience. Thank you Terry for your professionalism, charm and knowledge. You made our experience wonderful! We will be back :)</Review>

<review>All aspects from booking to flying has been absolutely amazing with Corporate Helicopters. Calvin was very thorough and patient in answering all of my questions concerning which helicopter ride would be a better fit experience wise and budget wise for my boyfriend and I. He made some great suggestions, including time of flight, that ended up being perfect for us.

Our pilot, Terry Frost, is hilarious, kind, and well versed on the sights. He started off the trip with humor, which helped my boyfriend and I relax as we were slightly anxious as it was our first time on a helicopter. Terry went over the safety speech effectively and ensured both of us were bucked in securely and comfortably before we lifted off. He explained the reasoning behind why we don't walk behind the helicopter. He was thorough in describing locations to us from an arial view, and was able to well manage communication to his team while showing us breath taking views of San Diego (also while enjoying a stunning sunset).

The flight was breath taking, and beyond what we expected. My boyfriend and I have already started looking into other flights we could take in the future since we may have become helicopter addicts due to this flight!< /review></record></dataset><record>

Our pilot was Terry and he was fantastic.  The pricing was reasonable and my kids 6 and 7 went up with my wife and I and we had a blast.  Great to see San Diego in a helicopter like that.  Highly recommend their services.  It was for my daughters birthday and she will never forget it!</text>

I surprised my girlfriend with the Diego Delight tour of San Diego. After checking out the competition and their pricing, I felt that Corporate Helicopters was the best deal. Our pilot Terry was very nice and funny. While being locals, we would have preferred a less pedestrian overview of San Diego, we appreciate that not everyone who does the tours knows about SD like we do.

Overall an AMAZING trip and we would totally do it again!< /Review>

This place is super great.  The tour is lovely -- San Diego is pretty special, particularly when viewed from the air.  What makes the whole experience really stand out was our pilot, Marshall.  The guy is friendly, funny, professional, knowledgeable, and just the kind of person you want in charge of an experience that you pay this level of money for.  I highly recommend.< /review>

{'time': 1582055029903, 'text': 'There must have been a miscommunication. We offer many helicopter flights and several helicopter tours packages. The tour package you asked about, The Soar and Sail, only sails at 10 & 1pm and the sailing portion needs to be booked a least a day in advance.\n\nAll of our flight coordinators care about our passengers and go out of their way to accommodate client requests - in this case, the package options may have been confusing.\n\nIf there’s a specific tour that you’d like to book, please give us a call back and we’ll be happy to help you. Otherwise our complete list of tours and information is on our website.  Also you may book directly from your phone, iPad or computer using our online booking system.'}< /Response>

Operator on the phone did a weird thing. In the beginning she/he said that there are tours available at 10 and 1 pm, then when I asked about one another tour all of the sudden there became no tours available today at all for me, really strange, I don’t think this person care for this business much.</Text>

Very impressed with the staff and our pilot Terry. Super clean and well kept aircraft -we felt safe in the hands of the CH staff and so were able to just.....enjoy what we were actually seeing. We have been San Diego locals all our lives and had NEVER seen the area in this way. So beautiful words cant describe.
My girlfriend is only unhappy about one part: the fact that I wont stop walking around telling people I'm going to buy a helicopter now!
Great big thank you to Corporate Helicopters and to anyone reading this ; this experience is priceless, the memories and pictures from this day will be remembered for the rest of our lives.</Review></record></dataset><record>

The "Top Gun" Helicopter ride is worth every penny, you get a 45 minute tour of all of San Diego.  Terry the Pilot is a great guy and lots of fun, from first meeting him until the end.  He is very knowledgeable, funny, and professional as well.  I suggest, even if you live in San Diego that you do this ride at least once.  I will definitely be going again!< /Text>

<review>WOW! This was the best!  As a surprise I wanted to take my 91 yr old Dad on a Helicopter ride but wasn't sure which company to go with. I did a little research and it seemed like Corporate Helicopters rec'd the best reviews.  And the ratings were absolutely correct!  They were the nicest and sweetest people ever!  The tour was amazing!  Our pilot Mitchell was especially patient with my hard-of-hearing Dad.  We felt comfortable and in good hands, not a worry at all!  They are super affordable ($324 for up to 3 people) and this tour is really worth every penny!   When back in San Diego we will do this again for sure!!</review><userid>105921501607735753037<//userid>< Rating>

I moved to San Diego 3 months ago with the intention of doing a discovery flight with Corporate Helicopters.  I absolutely loved it and want to pursue learning to fly helicopters.  My instructor Josh was amazing and has great techniques of teaching.  He described concepts in the correct terminology but can easily convey to someone who is just learning and relate to other aspects in order for the student to understand what he is teaching.  He was very positive and loves what he does. Corporate Helicopters is great, very nice and enthusiastic staff and is in a great location.  I go there sometimes just to hang out and gaze at the helicopters.  Thanks a lot Corporate Helicopters, I loved my experience and hope there will be more in the near future!!< /text>

The staff was friendly and showed world class professionalism. The tour itself provided an exhilarating experience of San Diego and gave us a brand new flavor of one of our favorite cities. I will be recommending Corporate Helicopters of San Diego to anyone! I will never forget the glint of the afternoon sun off the water as we cruised down the La Joya coastline and past Mission Beach. This trip is a must-do for anyone who lives in the moment!< /Review>< Pictures>

Our tour was just this past Tuesday (10/30/18) and it was FANTASTIC!!!!!!! I got this as a birthday present for my fiancé because he’s never been in a helicopter and it was his first time in San Diego and he LOVES avation. He loved it!!!!!! Our pilot Terry was absolutely wonderful. He was funny, informative, accommodating, professional, and safe. Their online system was easy to navigate. I got him the romance package and got to drink champagne while seeing the sunset over the ocean and city. I cannot recommend this place enough!!! Excellent experience, professional staff, safe and fun environment all wrapped into an amazing flight.</text>

<Text>Once in a lifetime experience! This is a world-class run organization in terms of quality and safety. We were greeted when we walked in the door with a big smile. We used the restroom before we went on our tour and it was luxurious and very clean. We then met our pilot Terry, who was a fun personality and instantly made you feel comfortable. Terry showed us the Helicopter hanger and drove us to the tarmac where our helicopter was located. Terry reviewed the safety features and then took pictures of my fiancé' and I in front of the aircraft. Our first impressions were that we felt extremely safe and excited.

We took off and started communicating over the voice activated headsets. Riding in a helicopter feels like flying around on a cloud! It's the coolest feeling to experience ever! We toured the San Diego country from a bird's eye and the views were absolutely stunning! We've lived in San Diego for the last 10 years, and nothing compares to the beauty you see from 1,000 feet floating around in a Corporate Helicopter tour!

We rate this experience a 10/10 across the board in terms of quality, safety, fun, and memories. Thanks for everything!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<text>ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE!!!  My friend and I were visiting San Diego and made a last minute decision to go on a helicopter tour.  The pricing was very reasonable, and the pilot was very friendly,helpful and funny.  He made the experience great.  The helicopter was clean and well kept.

Went there for the Fly, Float, Feast package and I have to say it was definitely worth it! We drove 100 miles out just to come here and the staff went above and beyond for us. Brianna was super helpful and friendly and our pilot Terry, had a great sense of humor.</review>

Just came off a tour. William was our pilot. Such a smooth flight. Showed us tons of stuff we would have never seen from the ground. Flew above the coastline for a while and then came back. I highly recommend this to anyone in the San Diego area. Once again, awesome job William. Thank you Corporate Helicopters.< /review>

Decided we would check out a helicopter tour since we'd never been here and found Corporate Helicopters online.  Liked their Unforgettable tour and was able to book it the same day.  Showed up a little early and everyone was very friendly, and our pilot, Terry, was awesome.  Neither my wife or I had flown in a helicopter before so this was a new experience for both of us, and we both commented afterwards that it was like floating in the air.  My wife gets motion sick pretty easy but didn't have a problem at all with the flight.  Great experience, great pilot and we'll have to do it again when we bring our daughter back!  Thanks Terry for a great flight!<//Text>< pics>

WOW!!! I can't say enough wonderful things about this trip.  Corporate helicopters really made our flight around San Diego amazing.  The views were breathtaking and you were really able to see the best view of the San Diego coast and the cliffs.  What really topped this trip off was the stop at a local winery where my boyfriend proposed to me :)  I can’t thank corporate helicopters enough for helping make that day so special!<//text>

My grandfather turned 94 recently, and he told us that he had never been in a helicopter.  He was a pilot before WWII and has always been an aviation enthusiast.  My sister and I decided to take him on a tour around San Diego.  We chose to use Corporate Helicopters' services.

The staff at Corporate Helicopters was professional and friendly.  After a short safety briefing, we were on our way.  Our pilot was skilled with her aircraft and knowledgeable of the San Diego area.  She flew us over many of the coastal area's most notable landmarks.

We could not be more pleased with our experiences at Corporate Helicopters and I will gladly recommend them to anyone looking to go up in the air in the San Diego area.<//text>

The best staff, the best pilot-cfi, most professional and safest experience we had. It was a birthday gift for my mother, she always wanted a helicopter ride and she got it, along with my sister and my self. We were fascinated and thrilled of our first time on a helicopter. They were talking about it all day. I highly recommend  to everyone and to the ones that will be their very first time  because Terry (the pilot) will make it the safest and funnest tour ever!!</Review>

I took a young Navy boy on the 60-minute flight over San Diego and the surrounding area.  He is stationed on the Carl Vincent and was totally stoked to be going on a helicopter.  We both had a blast.  It wasn't my first ride but it was certainly my favorite one.  The staff were awesome and our pilot was fabulous and even if he's just faking it(he wasn't), he is very engaging and interested in who you are and where you come from.  I can't wait to come back and take my daughter who missed this flight because she was sick back at the hotel.< /Text>

< Review>
Fantastic!!!! I have gone on helicopter trips only 3 times in my lifetime (I am 53). At 17yrs from Las Vegas through the Grand Canyon with my parents, and then 2 years ago over Manhattan with my daughter.
Now, what this trip did not have the same in sights to offer, but it sure was compensated by the service and flight experience.  Very quaint, very friendly.  San Diego and its coast are beautiful.  The ground staff and the pilot just fantastic.  Unlike the "commercial" feeling of the other trips, this one is like going on a flight with your friend who is the pilot.
This time, also, it was my very romantic trip with my girlfriend.
Now, let me tell you, the next day, which is tomorrow, I am taking both of my daughters on the very same trip.
Corporate Helis is not rated 4.9 of 5 on google for no reason.  I shall come back to take their longer distance Mexico trips as well.
A grand experience! And I do travel the world!< /Review>

Took a flight this morning and it as a fantastic experience! Corporate Helicopters far exceeded my expectations. Our pilot, Terry, was extremely knowledgeable about the local area. 6 stars if I could!</review>

Took my dad for his 60th birthday.  What an awesome experience.  Our pilot was great.  Very welcoming and friendly.  I highly recommend using Corp. Helicopters for anyone looking for a great price and extreme professionalism.<//text>

<Text>I surprised my  son with The Unforgettable Helicopter Tour for his 11th Birthday. His older brother and I blind-folded him and put on ear buds so he would have no idea where he was going. We took off the blindfold when he was sitting in the Helicopter and when he opened his eyes and saw the Helicopter, his jaw dropped.
Our pilot, Terry Frost, was so charming. He even sang him Happy Birthday! Terry did a fantastic job Touring us and pointing out all of the important landmarks San Diego has. There was a baseball game at Petco Park that had gone into extra innings and that meant that there was a restriction on flying over Petco Park and Downtown San Diego while the game was still going. Terry did not want us to miss out on this part of the tour, but he kept checking with Lindbergh Field to see when the the restriction would be lifted and he made a huge effort to time our Tour along the Coast just right so that we would still have time to make a pass over Petco Park. This added effort made a huge difference in the tour. I had done this Tour about 13 years ago with Corporate Helicopters and it was amazing. When I looked them up again, I knew I was in great hands and their staff was beyond patient with all of my questions prior to booking the tour. I was so excited to show my boys how lucky we are to live in such a beautiful city. I can't wait to do this again!!!</Text></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5</rating><text>I am from the East coast and was in San Diego for a conference. My two sons and I decided to experience our first helicopter ride over San Diego. We choose the Surf and Turf package and was blown away. We got to see some of most beautiful homes I have ever seen. The ride down the coast was equally impressive. The helicopter was brand new, comfortable and picture friendly! The pilot was very knowledgable about the area and extemely professional. I would highly recommend Corporate Helicopters for an experience you will not forget.< /text><Resp>None< /Resp>< Pictures>

< Review>
WOW!!  What a wonderful experience with Corporate Helicopters.  I first learned about this company on FOX News when Heather, Fox Reporter, was interviewing one of Corporate Helicopter's Pilots, Peter.  It was a great interview and from this exposure I decided to go to their location and check it out.  Upon arriving I met Jesse, Flight Coordinator, who booked my Valentine Flight.  I was excited that I had an opportunity to pick and reserve a time on Valentine's Day since they are so popular they book up quickly.  Once we arrived we were met by Jesse, and Mandy, Operations Manager, who is so extremely nice and fun to talk to.  Mandy offered us some champagne and handed my wife some roses and then introduced us to Amanda, who gave us a tutorial on our flight.  Amanda then drove us out to the flight deck area via a golf cart and we boarded this very nice Helicopter which is made in Torrance California.  It is a beautiful Helicopter that sits four people counting the Pilot.  Our Pilot turned out to be Peter who was in the interview with Heather.  The flight was smooth quite and our Pilot, Peter, was superb.  We went from Montgomery Field to north of Mt. Soledad, north of Torrey Pines and looped back along the coast at about 1,000 feet.  As we went over the ocean we spotted a California Gray Whale, the water was so clear and the whale was right below us.  The flight hugged the coast line down to Mission Beach over Sea World, then south to San Diego Bay, down to the Coronado Bridge, circle around downtown and over Petco Park and back to Montgomery Field.  It was such a beautiful flight and Peter explained so many things throughout the flight that made the trip that much more interesting.  I highly recommend you take the time to check out Corporate Helicopters and you too will find yourself booking a flight that will leave you with sense of joy and satisfaction and a true thrill.  Very awesome!!!<//Review>

This is was a surprise for my girlfriend and we did the 30 min tour. The pilot/tour guide was great and the service while scheduling was better than most. If you're debating going, don't. Go for it.</text>

<Review>I love this place. What’s the first thing you think about when you’re looking for someone to service your car. ..”Can I trust them??”..well this place can be believed..and the service is like none other, welcoming, fast, and professional. Their prices are very reasonable ..I drive 20 miles to go to., that should say it all ..I recommend them to ALL my friends I would recommend Value  Auto Repair to anyone without a doubt! The best customer service and reasonable prices. My go-to auto shop from now on  Very professional and reliable.!!</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Usually these kind of places seem shady, maybe I lucked out, but overall it was a fast and good experience. I went to check out a truck(ended up buying it) I was in and out of there pretty fast. I was helped by David , the manager, he showed me the numbers and I was happy with what I saw. The truck is great, low miles California truck. I missed a slight dent in the door but that’s my fault. Overall I’m satisfied with my purchase. You get a 30 day warranty once purchased which gave me a good piece of mind. The selection is pretty good since they have 2 separate lots. Nothing to complain about except the original salesman had a HEAVY accent, and at times I had no idea what he was saying.<//Review>

Got a decent looking car with “no problems” , clean title, seemed perfect, every day (4) that I’ve had it so far there has been nothing but problems !! Even after taking it to THEIR mechanic. Please get your cars elsewhere, this experience has been extremely disappointing.< /review><rating>1< /rating>< UserId.>

I liked the car, but left with a very disatisfied feeling with the overall experience. the people are not very honest when it comes to their business practices. The "owner" never seems to be available,  not even by phone, leaving dishonest car sales people in charge. I am still waiting for a phone call...I had no choice this time around, needed the car. Never again.<//review>

First of all I want to mention LOUIE, the sales rep, is extremely knowledgeable about cars and is very professional. Make sure to ask for him!! I bought an infiniti G37 sedan a year ago from him and it's been an amazing car not a single issue since I've owned it.  I came in not knowing what car I wanted as a second car for work. I just knew I wanted a coupe.  I saw they have many nice cars on-line. I originally thought about a Honda civic coupe however Louie showed me a bmw, lexus, cadillac and the Honda all within my price range. I went with the Cadillac cts coupe and I love it!! If it wasn't for him I would be driving around in an average car. But now I'm driving in a luxury Cadillac cts coupe. A real head-turner with no problems at all. They made financing super easy and was in and out stylin' in my new hot car in no time.  The owner and management are amazing very helpful throughout the buying process. I Highly recomend this dealership to everyone. Trust me, come here and see Louie and you'll leave happy with your new car !! I love you value cars!! :)</text>

RUN, RUN, RUN!

We talked to the dealership many times about this particular car, and Marco agreed on a certain price plus two items that the car was missing.  When we were ready to close the deal he came back and said that the items are not included.  Fortunately we have everything via text.  When asked about not following through with what he committed on, he said it was not approved by his manager.  Huh?  That is not our problem.  We tried to get a hold of "Jack" the owner, and when I called another person said, "He's not here-he has your number---" and hung up.  He never took my name and hung up abruptly.  We tried to simply have Marco stand by the offer HE made via text, and he didn't.  We were ready to pay via cash on the spot, and they blew it with their unprofessional, unethical attitude.

DO NOT BUY FROM THEM... THE RUN AROUND, LYING AND UNPROFESSIONALISM IS NOT WORTH IT!<//Review>

Not being able to strike a deal, does not make a business a bad business or unprofessional.  In fact, she never stepped into our place of business.

We sell 10 year old European cars as is, and price them accordingly.  We accept the fact that we cannot make every single deal, but the use of reviews to make demands on a small business is not acceptable.'}<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80d9536d8291f751:0xe3e60bee776c5a56< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We bought our car in April 2017. A nice car that we took for granted was in perfect shape. The C. D. player didnt function properly and the passenger window doesnt work (the least of our concerns but still...) End of August we had to buy 2 new front tires! A month later it wouldn't start. The battery died! We've been having to spend money on repairs. When my husband called Marco, the manager, he blew us off! Didn't care.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I am a repeat customer from value cars, three times over. I have always been taken very well care of. My previous car had transmission issues and they helped me deal with Volkswagen and get it taken care of (under warranty). My husband also purchased his truck from them and is very happy. My husband is in the military and when he has been gone, Value Cars answered my questions. Everyone there was really nice and helpful. I'm super excited about my new VW. And very happy and satisfied with my service and sales person.</Text>

<text>Just bought a car from Value Cars (18th store).  Our salesman, Marco, was awesome, he took his time and anwered all our questions.  He took us to all 3 locations and work with us until we found just the right car.  We purchase a Sentra and we are very pleased with the car and the service we received from Marcos and the staff at Value Cars.<//text></record>

I went and had lunch thinking they could never get me financed when i got back the saleman David told me to pick out a car i was so surprised. I enjoyed my car for two years and now i came back to get another one because the service was so good. I had my mind set one this particular car but after trying to get a car that didnt fit my need my saleman Jamie asked if there was any other car that i would like he showed me a much nicer car that had better reviews and better quality i took it for a test drive and i was satisfied and happy that he recommended this car if i had to buy another again i will return to Value Cars again<//Review>< Rate>

<review>Breaking down anywhere is no fun ordeal but I'm sure glad I broke down near this Napa. The employees were great very proffesional friendly and knowledgeable and they saved my ads. My water pump went out and was leaking bad so I couldn't drive to the store. They delivered the part to me within 15 mins. Great service I will go out of my way to patronize this parts store. It's too bad there's not many stores that treat you like this one. Great experience will definitely buy my parts there when I'm in the area.</review>< GmapID>

Most of time you can get anything at this Napa by the next day even though this store is fairly remote being the last & only auto parts store before you get to Shaver Lake. This is not a Walmart or some hardware store with an auto section, this is a true auto parts store with the Napa name behind it. The guys that work there are pretty knowledgeable and if they can't get what you need they'll point you in the direction you need to go. Now this place is not the cheapest but giving the circumstances I stated above I have never been disappointed in getting my parts here plus they also have a hydraulic hose making machine that's invaluable.<//review>

<text>These guys are terrific!  Went in with a broken wiper arm. They found me a spare part and helped me fix it - all no charge! Very friendly and helpful.  Not the first good experience I’ve had here. I will go out of my way to do more business here.< /text>< Pics>

Don’t plan on rushing the drive around the lake or being upset about bikes or pedestrians on the road- it is a place to relax and enjoy. Seriously, slow down on drives around the lake. Save the speed for water skiing. Find a trail and see the sights nature has to offer.<//review><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80942eb4270263ad:0xa33fa6e4e667d84b</gmap_id>< Date>

Really beautiful lake. Supposedly there are some jellyfish in the lake as well by the dam (don't worry, none stinging ones). I didn't spot them, but read an article about it.

Not a lot of parking available, people tend to just park on the side of the road. We drove around but didn't end up staying due to the summer crowds. There are some public bathrooms by the actual parking lots too, as well as a few restaurants, and a rental place for boats and jet skis etc.< /Text>

<review>June 2020 update: Campgrounds are open, though many of their sites seem to be on hill/slope terrain. There is a road that goes around the entire lake/one lane 2 way traffic. Asked staff what's the best time to beat the crowds, arrive at 7-8am for a good spot. No safe walking trail for hikers at this lake. Not alot of shade by entire lake shore, bring umbrellas/canopy. Bathrooms with flush toilets with sinks dispersed through out the lake, they are in horrid condition due to mass amounts of crowds. Make sure to read posted signs to avoid strictly enforced ticketing my staff/sherrifs.  Parking is free if you park outside designated parking lots, some parking by boat launch but must pay. Water is warm, too many boats and swimmers for peaceful fishing during the summer, limited fishing spots. Unfortunately someone drowned during our visit, water has strong currents (designated swim area seems safer for children with calm currents) becareful and have fun everyone!< /review>< Rating>

Hell, the rain might've been the best part. It was pretty well drenched, but the air was clear except for the occasional cloud walking low over the pied trees. Might be worth seeing it in the spring, but my money's on fall.</text>

(Translated by Google) To walk very well but for fishing I think that not very good I say it because there were many people fishing and no one got anything probably not to be a good season

(Translated by Google) Beautiful place to visit, has two road accesses to enter.
in this time we find a lot of snow, so there is not much parking option, but of equal you can enjoy nature.

So impressed by the care from the team at Dr. TF Chen Fresh Coast Dentistry! The staff was so friendly and accommodating. They were wonderful with Covid protocols and everyone was masked and stations constantly sanitized. Everyone - from the greeting at reception to the doctor to the hygienists - was welcoming and kind, and took the time to explain each step in procedure. What really put my experience over the top is that the office is so new and well-designed. They even pulled up streaming services on the overhead screens so I could select a program to watch as I had my cleaning - and I assure you watching “Star Wars” makes all that scraping and polishing more bearable! Really impressed all around. Will return and Will recommend!<//text>

<review>I feel so lucky to have found such a kind and honest dental office for my son who was in immediate need of help. Dr. Scott Chen was open, honest, patient, explained everything very well and made us both feel very comfortable. His assistant was amazing too! She has a sweet and calming presence.

Dental offices like this are extremely hard to come by! Feeling very grateful! Id like this to be the office our whole family goes to.

The woman who runs the front desk, Allison, is also great! Making an appointment was easy and we receive text message reminders and communication.

The new office is beautiful and has tons of parking!</review><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1622854810294, 'text': 'Thank you Misty for your kind words.

<text>I felt welcomed, from the moment I walked in.
There was clear, step-by-step communication and I was given great attention and concern.

I felt taken care of and appreciated.

I am very happy I chose to use this dentist as my new personal location.

Highly recommend.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Been coming here for about five years. Everyone is really nice and professional. I have never felt that they frivolously prescribe fillings or procedures. Have done about 2 fillings for me in that time. My gum health has improved with their oversight and recommendations. They also did a night guard which has held up well over the last few years.</Review>

<Review>I am deathly afraid of the dentist. Usually they will recommend me being put to sleep or be given some kind of laughing gas or sedative so I dont shake and fling my arms everywhere. I was in dire need of a deep cleaning and my fiance had me to to Dr. Chen. I just had the first quarter done today and I left feeling pretty good. I was numbed properly and the hygienist was very patient with me, which I always appreciate. She was informative and gentle and paid attention to whether or not I was in pain. Thank you for making my visit pleasant and not traumatizing me :)<//Review>< Resp>

<text>I woke up with a real bad tooth ache Monday morning of Thanksgiving week.  My regular dentist was on vacation and I was referred to Dr. Chen’s office.  They explained their Covid protocols, emailed forms to fill out, and had me come in at noon that day. I arrived at noon and waited in my car not more than a few minutes before they came to check me in.  I got some X-rays and Dr. Chen explained what was wrong.  Not a huge fan of going to the dentist, especially during a pandemic, but Dr. Chen and his staff couldn’t have been more accommodating and helpful. The fact that they got me in same day at the actual time I was scheduled would have been a 5 star review, but they were also nice and professional! Thank you!</text><GmapID>0x80c2c056137f3cc3:0xa6c73501ab05b9c1< /GmapID></record>

<text>After not going to the dentist for 15 years! Yes, 15 YEARS!  It was time. So, I went to google and looked up, “good dentists in Glendale.” Dr. Chen’s office was the first one to come up.  So, I schedule an appointment with them and they were able to see me right away.  Dr. Rosanna Chen and the staff are truly AWESOME! They made me feel comfortable and safe. They were talking to me and telling me what they were doing as they were working on me. They truly are the BEST!

<review>My experience with Dr. Chen’s D.D.S. office has always been great!  The new location on Colorado is very impressive.  The whole entire team is extremely professional from the beginning to the end of your treatment session.  They are very friendly and thorough with every patient’s needs.  I’ve been going to them for many years and the health of my mouth has definitely been better every year!  They use the latest technology and work with all types of insurance.  Thank you again for caring so much for all your patients!<//review></record>

Dr. Chen’s office has provided our family with first rate dental care for many years. The super friendly staff is efficient, answers all questions clearly and in detail, and offers useful advice. They have made extensive modifications to appointment procedures and I felt very comfortable visiting them during the Covid pandemic.</Review>

Recently switched to Dr. Rosana Chen after a recommendation by a friend. Very professional atmosphere and the staff were all very friendly. Keeping in mind COVID-19, they do check your temperature before going in and require a face mask at all times until directed to remove it. They do provide hand sanitizer though. Overall a great experience.<//Text>

He and his staff, specially, Mamie, are very knowledgeable, professional, helpful and friendly. I feel relaxed and at ease knowing that I have the ‘BEST’ dentist in Southern California caring for my/our dental care. I have referred my family and friends which see him as well. I must add that I/we travel over 40 miles to see him, as needed, from the Inland Empire. Although, it is rare that I write reviews, I wanted to post this one.
I highly recommend Dr. Chen & his staff to anyone looking for a dentist that will make you feel unique in caring for your dental care and hygiene. We are happy to hear that his son, Scott, is joining his practice. A+< /Review>< pictures>

Great overall experience! I came to replace my missing filling and Dr Chen was very gentle and talked me through every step. The numbing process was completely painless which is rare to find. The office has a very attentive stuff and applaudable pricing transparency. They called my insurance company multiple times and made sure I understood everything concerning the payment.... I’ve been to several offices in the past that did not bother explaining the payment process whatsoever which resulted in high bills and often times unnecessary up charges...This practice is different. Highly recommended!</Review>

<Review>Dr. Chen is very skilled and tolerant of patients’ individual needs and is very willing to use alternative methods to achieve the mutual goal of patient comfort, safety and positive outcome, which is my experience. I have been coming to this provider for many years and he is one of the best dentists I have ever worked with in the capacity as a very nervous and highly sensitive patient.  Dr. Chen has a great deal of patience and skill in treating people in this category with a high degree of success.  His fantastic reputation precedes him!<//Review>< Pics>

Afterwards the doctor examined  his teeth and found that his crown needed  to be replaced  and a cavity. In all great experience

I have been going to this office for a few years now. Every visit is handled with so much care and consideration. From the front desk to the Dr. herself, they are always warm and welcoming. They always want to take the best course of action for their patients, without being concerned with cost. If you want a dentist that genuinely cares about you, and doesn’t treat you like just another patient then this is the place.< /Text>

I went in for a cleaning. I saw the doctor first & then had to wait 30 minutes for the cleaning. Poor scheduling.  Then the hygienist had not been told by the front office that  the reason I chose this office was because they have a Cavitron. It was also written on my New Patient forms.  She was not set up to use it - & said she doesn’t usually use it. Poor communication...</Review>

So impressed by the care from the team at Dr. TF Chen Fresh Coast Dentistry! The staff was so friendly and accommodating. They were wonderful with Covid protocols and everyone was masked and stations constantly sanitized. Everyone - from the greeting at reception to the doctor to the hygienists - was welcoming and kind, and took the time to explain each step in procedure. What really put my experience over the top is that the office is so new and well-designed. They even pulled up streaming services on the overhead screens so I could select a program to watch as I had my cleaning - and I assure you watching “Star Wars” makes all that scraping and polishing more bearable! Really impressed all around. Will return and Will recommend!<//Text>

Dr. Scott Chen was open, honest, patient, explained everything very well and made us both feel very comfortable. His assistant was amazing too! She has a sweet and calming presence.

Dental offices like this are extremely hard to come by! Feeling very grateful! Id like this to be the office our whole family goes to.

The woman who runs the front desk, Allison, is also great! Making an appointment was easy and we receive text message reminders and communication.

The new office is beautiful and has tons of parking!</review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1622854810294, 'text': 'Thank you Misty for your kind words.

<review>I am deathly afraid of the dentist. Usually they will recommend me being put to sleep or be given some kind of laughing gas or sedative so I dont shake and fling my arms everywhere. I was in dire need of a deep cleaning and my fiance had me to to Dr. Chen. I just had the first quarter done today and I left feeling pretty good. I was numbed properly and the hygienist was very patient with me, which I always appreciate. She was informative and gentle and paid attention to whether or not I was in pain.

They explained their Covid protocols, emailed forms to fill out, and had me come in at noon that day. I arrived at noon and waited in my car not more than a few minutes before they came to check me in.  I got some X-rays and Dr. Chen explained what was wrong.  Not a huge fan of going to the dentist, especially during a pandemic, but Dr. Chen and his staff couldn’t have been more accommodating and helpful. The fact that they got me in same day at the actual time I was scheduled would have been a 5 star review, but they were also nice and professional! Thank you!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

After not going to the dentist for 15 years! Yes, 15 YEARS!  It was time. So, I went to google and looked up, “good dentists in Glendale.” Dr. Chen’s office was the first one to come up.  So, I schedule an appointment with them and they were able to see me right away.  Dr. Rosanna Chen and the staff are truly AWESOME! They made me feel comfortable and safe. They were talking to me and telling me what they were doing as they were working on me. They truly are the BEST!  Thank you Dr. Rosanna Chen and team!< /review>

My experience with Dr. Chen’s D.D.S. office has always been great!  The new location on Colorado is very impressive.  The whole entire team is extremely professional from the beginning to the end of your treatment session.  They are very friendly and thorough with every patient’s needs.  I’ve been going to them for many years and the health of my mouth has definitely been better every year!  They use the latest technology and work with all types of insurance.  Thank you again for caring so much for all your patients!</Text>

Recently switched to Dr. Rosana Chen after a recommendation by a friend. Very professional atmosphere and the staff were all very friendly. Keeping in mind COVID-19, they do check your temperature before going in and require a face mask at all times until directed to remove it. They do provide hand sanitizer though. Overall a great experience.<//Review>

First time back since the pandemic. Dr. Chen's office has put in serious protocols to keep everyone safe. Air cleaners in every room. Wait outside until the waiting room is empty, masks and face shields, temperature checks.  - thank you for the precautions.<//Review>

< review>
My wife, two children (adults now) and I have been coming to see Dr. Chen for over 25 years. He and his staff, specially, Mamie, are very knowledgeable, professional, helpful and friendly. I feel relaxed and at ease knowing that I have the ‘BEST’ dentist in Southern California caring for my/our dental care. I have referred my family and friends which see him as well. I must add that I/we travel over 40 miles to see him, as needed, from the Inland Empire. Although, it is rare that I write reviews, I wanted to post this one.
I highly recommend Dr. Chen & his staff to anyone looking for a dentist that will make you feel unique in caring for your dental care and hygiene. We are happy to hear that his son, Scott, is joining his practice. A+< /review>

<review>Great overall experience! I came to replace my missing filling and Dr Chen was very gentle and talked me through every step. The numbing process was completely painless which is rare to find. The office has a very attentive stuff and applaudable pricing transparency. They called my insurance company multiple times and made sure I understood everything concerning the payment.... I’ve been to several offices in the past that did not bother explaining the payment process whatsoever which resulted in high bills and often times unnecessary up charges...This practice is different. Highly recommended!< /review>< Gmap_id>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>Dr. Chen is very skilled and tolerant of patients’ individual needs and is very willing to use alternative methods to achieve the mutual goal of patient comfort, safety and positive outcome, which is my experience. I have been coming to this provider for many years and he is one of the best dentists I have ever worked with in the capacity as a very nervous and highly sensitive patient.  Dr. Chen has a great deal of patience and skill in treating people in this category with a high degree of success.  His fantastic reputation precedes him!< /Review><resp>None< /resp>< rating>

My son has sensitive teeth and the dental hygienist was very good and applied  a gel so she can clean. My son had no complaint

Afterwards the doctor examined  his teeth and found that his crown needed  to be replaced  and a cavity. In all great experience

I recommend this dentist<//Review>

I have been going to this office for a few years now. Every visit is handled with so much care and consideration. From the front desk to the Dr. herself, they are always warm and welcoming. They always want to take the best course of action for their patients, without being concerned with cost. If you want a dentist that genuinely cares about you, and doesn’t treat you like just another patient then this is the place.< /text>

<Review>I went in for a cleaning. I saw the doctor first & then had to wait 30 minutes for the cleaning. Poor scheduling.  Then the hygienist had not been told by the front office that  the reason I chose this office was because they have a Cavitron. It was also written on my New Patient forms.  She was not set up to use it - & said she doesn’t usually use it. Poor communication...< /Review>< pics>

Service is always prompt even when they have a full house. The service here is friendly. The bill was fair I would say. They have so many good reviews for a reason.<//text>

Good, solid deli sandwich.  They have some interesting featured sandwiches on their menu and make a tasty panini too.  Cold beers in the fridge if you're into that type of thing.
Staff is always friendly.  Service is on the slower side, just make sure you got time.

They tend to be heavy handed with the mayo and mustard, that's how they do it, unfortunately I forget to ask them to go easy until I am a couple bits into it.< /Text>

This place has a menu of mouth watering selection of sandwiches to choose from. If what you see isn't to your liking, you can build your own sandwich. A variety of delicious meats, cheeses and veggies to create something delightful and just for you. I asked if could get a lettuce wrap expecting to be told that wasn't an option. But the lady behind the counter, without missing a beat said," I can wrap anything you want". And so she did. Long story short, I highly recommend Prima Deli.< /review>

My son says, "I would refer Prima Deli to anybody who wants a good sandwich and who's hungry". The bathrooms are clean, the place is clean, the food prep area is clean, people are Pleasant the food is always fresh. It's pricey but you its worth it I was looking for marble rye for years, I found it at Prima Deli. I will not eat any other deli sandwiches. Real talk!</review>

Best sandwich place ever! I've never experienced a better place to eat for a sandwich...they have a variety of drinks, chips , and candy.  A little expensive but every penny is worth it.  People there are very nice and location is very good.< /Text>

<review>Old school deli feel to it.  They shave the cold cuts right in front of you.  Damn good sandwiches and salads.  They feature"Boars Head" meats btw.  Should satisfy any "east coast" sandwich lover< /review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Local bros making local specialty sandwiches like the Redwood City, etc.  Good sandwiches, I had the Dave's special and I loved it.  They had a couple beers in the fridge and lots of other drinks. Deli meats for sale too, looked good.  I'll be back for the sandwiches for sure.< /text>< Rate>

<time>1517173335269< /time><Rating>4<//Rating><text>FYI: When Prima Deli gets busy, they simply take their phone off the hook. They're not actually answering calls. Then they often forget to put the phone back on the hook. I wish they would at least have a message that said "we're currently too busy to take call-in orders" instead of making people think they should just redial indefinitely.
Regardless, Prima is a great place to get quality sandwiches and the service has always been friendly.<//text>< Pics>

The folks at Prima Deli can't be beat!  They are the best.  And the food?  Terrific!  Can get crazy busy, but the staff just haul a** and get you what you want as fast as they can.  Love the shop and its people!<//Review>

Can get quite busy especially on the weekend after little league/soccer, but they are still super efficient and working hard.

Pro tip: Try the TBA on toasted ciabatta. It's a good one!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

< Review>
Been going here for years and years, all the way from the first generation owner ran it and down to his son when he passed down the business. Always quality sandwiches and fantastic food. It gets busy during lunch but that's expected with any quality deli. Favorites are the prima club, spicy combo, and pesto chicken. I have noticed the staff isn't as friendly on recent visits but not enough to affect the experience. Highly recommend.</Review>

Hands down best sandwiches in Redwood City, imo.
Lunch time? Expect a line (and for the phone line to be busy, or off the hook, can never tell which...) but also expect the staff to greet and help you out with a smile. Love this place!</text>

When I told this lady how to make my sandwhich on the phone she couldn't understand how i wanted my sandwhich made. Then i got charged extra to pick it up. She has terrible customer service she laughed and smirked when i asked why im getting charged extra. When i pay for my food i expect it to be how i want it. And she shouldn't be answering the phone if she can't take a simple order</Text>

< Review>
We have been going to Prima Deli for years. Recently we had a sandwich that was too oily and returned it with one bite removed from it. The owner inspected the sandwich then throw it into the garbage can with an attitude. The person helping me said could we make her another sandwich? He said whatever that's ridiculous and turned his back to me rudely. In complete amazement I told the kid helping me never mind and walked out. Now Prima Deli can add to their list of business accomplishments "thieves ".<//Review>

Love this place for a good sandwich! One of my favorite delis around, better than a safeway sandwich and better than woodside deli in my opinion...
I recommend the NorCal w/ bacon</review>

I was pleased with the service overall. They have release forms for you to sign along with temperature checks. If you've gotten your nails done post COVID, you'll notice the sharp price increase in all services, at all salons. I got a full set with short white tips and clear gel and it cost $50. It used to be $35. Wish that the prices were posted. But overall, a good salon and I will return.</text>

Do not waste your time here, especially if you want a dip manicure. I was initially told 15 minutes to wait for my manicure. After 15 mins I was then told 30. After that time I was told another 30. I was offered no resolution to this problem at all. It was an absolutely appalling experience and would not wish it on anyone.<//Review><response>None<//response><user_id>100536220673678238857< /user_id><gmap_id>0x80c2b673d943763d:0xbf97c376acf4231c</gmap_id><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

<date>1616055200011<//date><text>I went to this place and got my nails done and my eyebrows done and my individual eyelashes. I like my eyebrows my eyelashes irritated me beforei I left she said that it would go away. The eyelashes continue to cut my eye my eyes were red and irritated and watering. I called and informed the lady on the phone that my eyes are really irritated and that I was going to come in to get them taken off. When I got to the nail shop they took off the eyelashes which was very painful and I informed the lady that it was really hurting really bad and she said it's okay. After I was finished she gave me a bill for $10. I told the nail tech that I didn't think I should have to pay because my eyelashes were done wrong. The nail tech laugh at me so I then walked away to Kelly which is the lady at the door who takes the money. I told her that I should not have to pay for a service that they did wrong. So then she tried to find excuses why I should have to pay she started with when did I get them done. I guess she was going to say I waited too long. But when I told her it was just two days ago she then went and said that I should have told her who did my eyelashes so that they could have took him off. She said that's the policy. She said because another person took them off I have to pay. Then when I looked around I didn't see the lady that did my eyelashes. Kelly then tells me to just give her $5. So that tells me that she know she was in the wrong but they wanted to get some type of money out of me. My eyes were bloodshot red no one never once apologized.</text>< Name>

My experience here today was awesome!!! 🥰🥰🥰 This is my regular nail salon; but because of work and covid I haven't been able to go in awhile.  Today was my first time in a long time and I was very impressed with their outdoor setup.  I was able to get a pedicure, manicure and my eyebrows done as well.  All while enjoying good company.  🤩🤩🤩</Text>

You go any other time you will find yourself in a LINE! Plus they check your temperature too over all it's outside under a tent the set up is very nice and safe distance.

<review>I've gone to Nancy for my eyebrows for a couple of years, she is fantastic! Recently had my gel manicure done by T and I was pleasantly surprised.  I have a regular nail tech at another salon but needed an appointment asap, and T did a good job. She will definitely be my back up from now on! (The pics show my nails at day 5)</review></record>

They charge a lot! I didn't mind paying as long as my Nails were done right. I will not go back due to my Nails lift after being done.

Seems charging such a extreme high price your nails shouldn't never lift. Just Aweful and painful! I will not recommend this place.

If you must go, ask for the best to do your nails so you don't go through nails lifting.

However I paid a lot to get my nails done. They did not last.

I had to go back because two of my expensive nails popped off.

Got those fixed and three more just lifted right off.

So I have to go around with my hands with missing nails due to I don't have time to keep going back getting them fixed.

Most Frustrating. It's what you call tricks of the trade to keep you coming back which is unfair. One knows just what they are doing when they half do your nails.

So be sure to tell whoever does your nails to make sure they don't lift on you.

They are extremely too high for mess like that.

In the long run I went to another Nail Salon and it was suggested by the New Nail Salon I went to...to take the nails off and put new nails on.

To my shocking surprise I had fungus under my one of my Nails! Omg! 😲
Not good at all.< /Text>

I was charged 30.00 for a gel polish change tht they did NOT tell me was all they were offering & they charged the client next to me 15.00 since she got a full set. I love how they do lashes here but them upping the prices like tht w/out warning is VERY wrong & I won’t be going back for my nails< /review>

The set-up is great due to the current conditions. I got a fill on a short set $40. I don't know what they were charging before covid. I think it's a bit overpriced but someone else messed my nails up so I really didn't have a choice.< /Text>

Sky was great. My feet feel and look so good. The foot and leg massage almost put me to sleep. I was in and out for my pedicure in 45 minutes.< /Text>

Just because they are one of a few place open means they get to charge you so much! And in top of that rude.. all i asked the lady who was doing my nails was if she could even out my nail since it was un even.. she flipped saying she will do it later not then.. and shook her head mad.. like what the hell im paying for your service lady its me the one who’s going to be wearing those uneven nails.. so what is the problem?<//review>

<review>The method they used to remove my dip powder ruined my nails.  The didn't soak it off but used a nail tip and popped it off this removing a layer of my finger nail and ripping the length of my nail.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6fh2G5HNV80qAuwELUyqI2Dwclw8Qsf5EXxZS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><date>1565572535782</date>< user_name>

I came last week and my nails popped off two days later I was missing 4 nails after I paid $50 for a short set gel polish. The lady who did my nails rushed through it. They are over priced for the service and work they do I ended up paying $60 just to get my feet done and even the work for that wasn’t $60 worth. I will not be coming back< /review>

Service begins the moment you walk in.  Quick with ample staffing, which is great yet has its disadvantages. Rushed services and mediocre results. Its a great place for a last minute or emergent need, but lacks long term quality. The picture below was taken 2 hours after leaving the salon
2 weeks later i tried them again, insisting on quality and they delivered<//review>

One day later & this is the results.😐 I went in around 5:15, I should've known when I opened up almost every color I like & it was dry as the desert. Finally I settled on this color because it was like new. There were 2 people inside 1 getting her nails done & 1 getting a pedicure by 2 separate people so the 3rd lady comes over to do my manicure... I Swear to you it took her almost an hr to do a simple Manicure that came out like you see in the pic..the next lady comes over around 6:05 to do my pedicure & by 6:20 she was done & they were rushing me out ...I asked what time they close,  she said 7 or 730 but it's Halloween we pass out candy..so you care more about passing out candy than having a returning customer? She messed up my big toe & started speaking in her language when I said I wasn't leaving until she fixed it(she was mad at me for her mistake) tried to fix it by polishing over it but I'm not one of them that will except that. Also this place looks as if hasn't had a deep cleaning since they opened which is another reason I should of just left & then some man that came to pick them up grabbed the file she was using on me & started using it on himself & then put it back for her to use it on me...I made sure she didn't touch me with that file...this place needs a visit from the health department...enter at your own risk....disgusting...that 1 star is for the nice lady who took an hr to do my manicure...her attitude was sweet..the others not so much..smh</text>

They are terrible! Wish I could give them negative 5 stars!  I have been getting my nails done for over 25 years and my nails are infected with fungus from going to them. I’ve been going there for years. The other day I went back and have asked for over coupe of months why my nails looked dark on a few spots on my nail under my acrylic. He lied and said it’s nothing. I got my nails filled and got gel polish. Twice in a couple of months it literally peeled off. I work in corporate America in a professional environment and need to be well groomed. I went back on my day off and was told I had to pay to fix the polish. Really!!! I paid $80 dollars and you’re charging me again for your terrible gel polish. Then the tech takes the polish off and I asked this guy who I never had do my nails why they are discolored. He said, that’s fungus. I went to the counter to tell the lm and they said I have to pay them to remove the nail!! What!? Then he blamed me and said you probably had water under your nails. What!! I wash my hands and take a shower daily so if there is then when I get my nails done make sure it’s dry. Since when does that cause fungus? They don’t sterilize their equipment! I’m reporting this to the state board and seeking legal counsel. Oh yeah, they put a dab of anti fungal serum on and said I need to go buy my own! No, you’re suppose to provide that for me! Your dirty utensils did this!< /review>

There is a reason this shop is always busy. They have a lot of great nail techs who do quality work. The prices are also very affordable. My favorite tech is Diamond and I will continue to patronize this shop as long as she is there.</Review>

When getting a pedicure it’s never really a wait. The pedicure is so relaxing however they have package deals that’s they don’t fully follow. Sometimes I do feel like they can rush to much and give you half service,with each package you get a set amount of time they are suppose to massage your legs but they do not follow it. Any type of hand nail service will definitely take longer then getting your feet done.</Review>

I got my nails filled with feet done with gel polish paid 70 dollars and after two days the polish was coming off.  Also two nails was lifting after 3 days I was very dissatisfied. It's not the first time I was disappointed with the service.< /review>

<text>I'm 19 and I've been coming here for about 3 years to get wax. Jackie is the only person I let wax me, and she has never failed. Katie is pretty good too. but for waxing, ask for Jackie because she's the bomb. the prices are excellent compared to nail and waxing places in the mall. as of getting the nails done, my experience has been good. nothing too bad. just make sure you tell them exactly what you want then ask how much it is even though you already know the price just to make sure they're on the same page as you. the people that work there are constantly smelling those chemicals 5+ days a week just to please the customers. if they mess up on something, tell them and they should fix it. as long as you're not yelling at them and being ghetto and loud, you should have a good experience.<//text>< user_name>

<Review>Attention to detail and customer service is not apparent here. Communication skills were an issue as well. My tech seemed more attentive to his phone. I could not even make it out of the store before two different nails smudged. One was fixed. At the time of the 2nd I asked for a refund was denied and told I should’ve done gel. The tech had suggested the regular.  Any place with more than 10 chairs is just after volume, not quality.<//Review>< Pictures>

My last two visits with Lily were garbage! I tried her again a few days ago after not coming for some months when she screwed up the last job… So I went in before an event I had to go to, expecting it to be in and out like always… Instead I spent two hours and got a cheap version of the picture I was shown… And she still charged me the price we agreed on for the nails with the design,even though she rushed thru my nails to get to the next client… And completely left off the design… there's no way I should've paid as much as I did for my nails… But again I had been there for two hours… She made me late to my event… And I didn't have time for the BS so I paid and left… And I hope it was worth it because not only will I never spend any money there again... I'm going to make sure my friends and family stop going there as well... *the pic on the left is not the exact design... but it's a lot closer than the BS on the right that I got... smh< /review>

This is the worst experience ever as I sit here in tears not able to leave before I share how horrible this morning was. It's the day before my bday and I wanted to get waxed and get my day started I walk into this place happy and ready for a beautiful Sunday morning but satan came in with a force. I asked for a wax privately as I have always done. The lady they paired me with I have never used her before she already was have a shouting match with the front desk guy about why she had to do me privately. As I feel this energy I'm upset at the fact that I'm even having to deal with such unprofessionalism. As she walks toward the room she yells at me"you will pay me 30 dollars for this room" as I gain my composure on this wonderful I tell her nicely you wont speak to me like that or in that tone. I turn around her colleague is laughing so I proceed to the front explain that I'm not comfortable with her representation and definitely not performing my services. When I say embarrassed and disrespected was an understatement. I will never come back here or recommend this raggedy place ever......< /text>

<Review>I was recently visiting the LA area and was looking to get a pedicure when I found this place. I was seated right away but I felt very rushed kind of like I didn't matter right at the that moment. They went way too fast and I was done in about 10 min. In other nail salons I have been to before I have had a much longer time. By the time they were done I felt like the job was incomplete. I don't think I would come back here again but if you like to pay a lot of money to get the largest package so that they will actually take the time to pay attention to you then I would highly reccomened.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

< Review>
I’ve lived in LA for over 3 years now and had been coming to Lisa’s every time. In fact, I would go out of my way but honestly, it’s a hit or miss with these guys. You never know who’ll you’ll get because the place is like nail salon warehouse. A few times I had a man name angel, he purposely put the nails on the very tip, a day or two after, you’re missing 1/2 of your nails on 1 hand. Is this to make me come back for fills? Weird. So sometimes it’s not worth the $80.

The eyelashes are a whole other department, there is this half black and half Korean eyelash technician  she is the bomb. Just be careful because the glue that they use is heavy duty and after my lashes would come off I would have to do major eyelash rehab. In other words, my eyelashes were gone.
The eye brow waxing omge yess, I was feeling like Beyoncé when I left. Just go somewhere else for the nails if you don’t like to take chances.< /Review>

I asked for a gel mani & pedi. So the first techinitian (many lady ) greeted me and just asked me a few questions regarding the services I was looking for. The second lady (pedi lady) got straight to work pulling my legs here pulling my toes Here! OMG she was so rough!!! And the worst part she just cut my nails short without asking me .
Aside from all this there was about another 7 employees some working some weren't but they were all on their phones such as on YouTube ( music playing nice and loud for everyone to hear) or having phonecalls.

This has been by far the most stressful mani and pedi .</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<Text>I got lashes here for a special occasion a couple of weeks ago. The lashes looked very natural and actually held up well. This morning I went to get them removed and to say I was mortified when looking in the mirror afterwards would be an understatement.

I asked the lady would removal hurt and she said "maybe just a little". Well it hurt A LOT. It was only after that I realized the pain I was feeling was her literally pulling off the fake eyelashes and taking mine with them!! She was at first gentle but once she experienced difficulty removing them, she got impatient and just started yanking them out!!

NEVER AGAIN.

These women don't care about preserving your natural lashes AT ALL. They are more concerned with getting you out of their chair and the next person in. I had full lashes before and now there are visible bald areas. I'm sick!!!<//Text>< Pictures>

This nail shop is a dump. Poor customer service. They don’t clean their utensils properly. All the gel nail polish is old and she doesn’t want to replace it. I paid $55 for a gel manicure and pedi. The next day my nail polish was lifting. Went back the next day and they didn’t want to fix my nails or my feet. When the polish was chipping . They talk major mess after I spent $55 plus tip these rude people $5 apiece. I will never go back here again.<//Review>

Good for the most part, but I'm giving it 3 stars because my last visit wasn't a pleasant one. The nail tech was getting impatient, and he was grumbling in his language because I was taking my time to look for a color. From the moment I sat down, he was asking me which color I want, even before he was ready to apply the color. I don't ever like to feel disrespected especially if I didn't disrespect you first. The manager was very helpful and apologetic, but even now I'm still upset. Before this experience I would have given it 5 stars.  Annie and Ms. Ivy are the best for pedicures.< /Text>

Is ok their service sucks, but their work is not bad I've had good and bad experiences 1 eyebrow lady sucks i always have to do detail at home because she just waxes what she sees and leaves all the baby hairs there, most of the time if they mess up on the the nail art and you ask them to re do it they get mad. Last time i got the gel in a day it came off on my index. I guess you have to pick and choose the real good artist for you to really get your moneys worth.< /review>

Terrible customer service. They guy that did my nails was awfully rude. He snatched my hand. He didn't want to show me polish colors. He told me if I didn't take off the nails I had which I intended to only fill he wouldn't do them. He also told me if I wanted metallic chrome nails he wouldn't do it unless I got them long. He argued with me about the proper name of "Mood Polish". Just really awful service. I'm never ever returning!</Review>

<review>I had a bad experience at Lisa's Beauty Salon I went for eyelashes and my eyelashes was glued on my eyes with weave glue my eyes swole up and I had to return the next day to get them removed and there was a second pair of eyelashes replace but those lashes still had my eyes swollen.
I spent $72 to get my nails done and have a pedicure then I paid $27.25 to get my eyelashes and eyebrows done I paid a total of $109.25 and I was totally dissatisfied and I will never return back to Lisa's Beauty Salon.
I even had the nerves to tip the guy that put my nails on my fingers.
I was also hurting for 2 days the liquid nail that place on the false nails had my fingers hurting  it was all on my cuticles all in the inside of the nails yes that was a horrible experience.
As for as I'm concerned they don't even deserve the one star that's my opinion and my experience there.
To me they look like they waiting to make a person at victim take they money and send them home dis satisfied.</review><rating>1</rating>< gmapID>

I ABSOLUTELY WOULD NEVER EVER EVER EVER COME BACK To This PLACE! THE SERVICE WAS THE WORST I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED! I TECH REFUSED TO DO MY NAILS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TheM FILED DOWN...AND THE MANAGER BACKED HER UP...THERE WAS ANOTHER WOMAN THERE WHO HAD AN ALTERCATION WITH THE SAME TECH. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND THEY TALK AB YOU IN CHINESE ....I SPEAK A LITTLE AND I KNEW WHAT THEY WERE SAYING....VERY UNPROFESSIONAL AND THEY RUSH THROUGH YOUR SERVICE AND LEAVE YOUR FEET FEELING HARD AND FLAKY...I DON'T RECOMMEND GOING TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT.<//Review>

< review>
Bad experience at this nail salon,  I walked in asked the from desk how much for manicure and pedicure she said $26.00 for regular I said ok, I went to the lady that was going to do the pedicure for me and she pulls a card with prices on and starts adding a bunch of things I said no, just regular, she starts to speak in her language with her partner and she starts working on my feet with attitude, them she asked me if I wanted my feet scrub and I said yes, she said is an extra dollar for that.
I was surprised that they want to take your money in any way possible.
Not a good place to go to do your nails.< /review>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>Never coming here again! They are cheaters and scammers! When you tell them what you want at they front desk they give you a price but once you sit down and start your nails they start adding charges out of nowhere. The prices aren't posted so you know they can charge you anything. I wanted a full set which is $16 plus coffin shaped which was an extra $9. I wanted a basic pedicure and she told me $16. I sit down and the man start my nails and said $33. How? He said the length. Coffin has to be long because of the shape so to add more money on top of that is ridiculous. Then the lady doing my feet told me an extra $5 because I had gel on my feet. I heard three other ladies arguing with their nail techs about prices too. They think you stupid and don't know what you're talking about. Don't waste your money here. The lady hurt me several times while doing my feet and full set is the worst I've ever had. Will not be returning.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I am giving this place a one star. I went to go do my eyelashes and I told the lady I want a natural look since I have very small lashes and she said okay. I was noticing she wasnt putting one by one, she would grab them by three she kept on adding more and more. After she was done she let me look at them she had them all stacked on each other. It didn't look natural at all she even added glue on top all missed place I had so much glue on my eye lids. It was just horrible. At the end I waited for a friend and I decided to take them off they so felt uncomfortable. What got me mad was that I even had to pay to take them off. The lady didn't do her job right I asked for something simple and she did the opposite it was just horrible!!</Text>

Decided to have a relaxing pedicure day with my Bestie, we got the luxury package which includes a scrub, 5 minute massage, and wax
My pedicure was alright, she could have done a little more considering the 25 dollar bill but I was making the best of it. My friend was done first, she got very unlucky and got a girl that rushed through her pedicure in 15 minutes or less! Before the polish could dry she rushed her out the chair asking her to go pay and wait up there😲 I was left alone for the 15 minute remainder until my pedicure was finished. Like my friend I was rushed out my chair as soon as the last stroke was applied to my big toe smh!! 30 bucks  (with tip) to be told to get up is horrible customer service, it takes away from the relaxing experience. If you are coming for a quick pedicure, a design, or gel color options come here, if you've had a long week and you want to get pampered DON'T!!!! They have no intentions on making the experience a relaxing one. You are a ticket, A number, And A Profit end of story.</text>

One of the WORST nailshops in Inglewood. The customer service sucks.  The shop is big and farely new but is overly crowded with nail techs sitting around doing nothing. With the well stocked nail techs on deck....  There are very few that actually does well and know what there doing.  Prices are overly high for such amateur service AND I WILL NOT BE VISITING THIS SHOP AGAIN in the future.</Text>

Average service, specially the front desk. If they have done some wrong dont expect correction to be swift.  Its the managing people that are more unconcerned than the actual techs. But the techs just follow orders<//Review>

<name>Jenelle Bossett</name><text>$15 for a basic pedicure....
BUT it did include the spa chairs which was fabulous. I felt so pampered as the chair massaged my aching back. Great with no extra charge!

(If you are getting a media/pedi combo they do not automatically turn on the chair massager so make sure you get them separate worth the extra wait time)

Only negative:
1. HELLA crowded. This place is like a sweatshop of nail care. SOO many stations, always busy, always crowded. Not a long wait time but you will be there with loads of people (great for people watching).

Overall $15 is fair for a basic pedi with spa treatment. If you wanna get the extras like the callous remover and foot massage that would run you extra.

They also do eyebrows pretty well so if your looking for diverse service this place is A-OK!<//text>< Pics>

THE WORST!
My nails look awful.  They are rude and talk behind your back because they would come to me saying something I had asked someone else.  They laughed at my face then smiled.  NO idea what they were saying about me, but I was not being paranoid.  One guy forced me to move my injured arm and I asked if he could move to the other side.  He had a temper tantrum and walked out! Just the worst experience ever.  RUDE RUDE RUDE! Just a mill of people walking in and out the door so they could care less about your comfort or experience.  To top it off, take a look around.  SUPER DIRTY! Probably catch some sort of staff infection or something there.  NEVER EVER GOING BACK AGAIN!</review>
