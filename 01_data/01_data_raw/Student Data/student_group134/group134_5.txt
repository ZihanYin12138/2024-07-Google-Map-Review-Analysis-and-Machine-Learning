< Review>
Our family has been using this facility and the de Soto location.  Dealing with storage isn’t usually the most pleasant experience,  but thanks to the new property manager Tory we will continue with our units for years to come.  She’s incredible and deserves raise / promotion.  Thank you for everything Tory.< /Review>

<review>Great facility. The problem is, for more then 1 year, front office not aloud people use bathroom. The guy in the front office explain that this is because of covid..??!!  When i ask him where did he go if needed, his answer was ,in the bathroom, which is not for the people ,just for his personal use. Very rood and disrespectful person. I'm 66 year old and this is simple discrimination. when i told him that i will report this problem to Better Business Bureau he said he don't care .Looks like this is the only option i have left .By the way, all businesses in Los Angeles aloud people use bathrooms. So the front guy just simply lazy to clean facility</review>< pics>

I use to rent space from another storage company a name that I care not to mention ( Public storage)....
They have the worst prices, employees. The prices are so high it's really sad they don't offer anything special with those prices not only that but if you are late one day they look for reasons to try and sale your items..

I saw a new Storage Ect.company that opened up right down the street from where I live, their prices are amazing to where I don't have to take on a second job in order to pay the bill, the young man that work there is nice, professional and very friendly. After talking with him I didn't get the feeling like he had some ulterior motive that they would waiting for me to be late on my payment so they can steal my things, in a word the best decision I've made when it comes down to a storage facility for my items....</text>

I highly (HIGHLY) recommend Storage Etc Topanga in Canoga Park. I was able to discover their incredible facility and customer service when I had to move most of my possessions last minute. Frank, Justin, and Kathy were SO friendly and accommodating  - and GENUINE. They have a van to use at no cost to move in and it is available to rent when moving out. They have complementary water and a restroom available, which are immensely important - and maybe forgotten -when planning and executing a major move.
There is parking and the facility is clean and safe.
I work for a company that prides itself on great customer service. The service I experienced at Storage Etc was top-notch. Totally unsolicited and just as much appreciated, I recommend this company and this team immensely. They made a very stressful time so much easier for me.< /text>

Honest to god this facility is absolutely fantastic. the staff is super friendly, the price of my unit was the best in town and, thankfully they had boxes and packing supplies right in the office! i did have to go down the street to box city for some oblong shaped boxes i needed, but everything else was one stop shop!< /text>

My experience with StorAge Etc Topanga has been exceptional. It is a very quiet, well kept, and secure self storage facility. It is in a convenient location and allows me to keep my family's home less cluttered at a competitive price.

I just signed up for a storage unit at the end of last week. I compared this place to 3 other storage facilities in the area and decided on this one. For 3 reasons...

1. I like that it's clean and spacious. Not just when you come in to park, the lobby and the driveway to the storage area. In comparison to the other places I looked at, this one looked the best.
2. There is a huge lobby area with everything you can possibly need from tape, boxes, mattress/couch covers, bubble wrap, etc.
3. Kristyn helped me find the storage unit for me and was super helpful. She never pressured me to take the unit right away and even allowed me to compare other facilities to show that her facility did indeed have the best rates in the area.

We haven't put things in storage yet as I got really busy, but will do so soon.

So far a good facility to rent storage at!<//Review>

<text>Convenient and nice location. Brand new storage facility. Solid infrastructure and maintained very well. Has a good car parking facility etc. There's an Assistant Manager Justin Potter who deserves to be the manager. He's very professional in his approach, very courteous and polite and clarified all my doubts. Wish I had met with him before moving my son's luggage over here but unfortunately, my wife and I met with the Manager whose customer service was very poor. So I am giving a one star rating.<//text><resp>{'time': 1563823572767, 'text': "Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

I called to inquire about renting a storage unit here and spoke with a lovely girl on the phone her name was Kristyn and she was nothing but helpful. She was so sweet and answered every question I had about renting storage, I have never had a storage unit before and she was extremely helpful like I said. Definitely manager material.

This was the first place I looked when trying to store my belongings during a sudden and stressful move, and I didn't have to look anywhere else! They helped me determine what size of a unit that I would need and held one reserved for me while I got my things ready and made my decision. Then, when I was ready to sign, they had boxes, tape, and everything else available at the same time, and the whole process took less than 10 minutes. I am more than pleased with my unit and the price couldn't be better, but the customer service is what ultimately won me over. Would definitely use them again!<//review>

This place is amazing. I was in a huge rush to get my precious things into storage before my dogs vet appointment, as I was flying out of town the following morning. Both Kristyn and James are an exceptional team- both accommodating and incredibly friendly. James went out of his way to help me, which he really didn't have to do. I am eternally grateful for both of them for making my experience so swift and enjoyable. Highly recommended< /Review>

Hands down the coolest facility I have ever stored at and I have used many. Super clean, secured with unit alarms, and tons of different merchandise options, they even have an EV charging station for my Tesla!<//text>

So I decided to call Storage Etc. in Topanga Canyon.

I spoke with Justin, and he was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. He showed genuine care and patiently explained to me the options that would fit my budget and my needs. After signing the contract, within minutes, I received my confirmation email and my access code. Justin also helped me to set up the auto pay, so I don't have to worry about late payment.

I also have interaction with other team members, Marko and Krystin, there were all really nice, courteous, and professional.

I highly recommended this place for your storage needs.</text><username>Vito Teruna</username><pics>None</pics><gmapID>0x80c29d60ebe439e1:0x8adc7953d4e3d76d<//gmapID>< user>

The level of care and service was outstanding. All the staff deserve kudo's for going above and beyond. Even though I have anxiety issues when dental work involves injections I would rate this my best dental visit ever.</review>

Service here is terrible! People up front are rude. Professionalism out the door. Was told to leave if I didn't have the payment. Wait time is redicoulous, why make an appointment. Pointless. How did any of you have a good experience.< /Review>

Really helpful staff; highly recommend the place. They take MediCal, so a good place for us poor people. It just took soo long sitting there and waiting for the dentist to come into the room. We spent 3+ hours at the office.< /Text>

<Review>I will say I had high hopes for this place after my initial visit I was to pick up antibiotics later that afternoon. When I stopped by the pharmacy they had nothing in my name...I checked the pharmacy across the street because I hoped we got our conversation wrong when the assistant and I discussed which pharmacy I used... neither one had a script in my name. I called the next morning no answer called the 800 number let them know what happened and they said they would have someone call me... I’ve gotten no calls still have abcess and still no answer at local office! I don’t want anything to do with this group now thank you but no one wants to be ignored or forgotten as a patient... maybe it’s because I’m a medi-cal patient.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Although it was just a consultation, and x-ray. I was greeted by staff in a  professional and friendly manner. However, I do believe through other people, that the one day service should be high quality as well.</Text>

. Missing teeth is imbarrssing. Not being able to eat with your friends anymore is devastating.  I went to other local dentist and I was never made to feel like anything but a payment.( a very very large payment)and I was  Always forgotten about . Having to Explain the same thing over and over to the exact same dentist became really annoying.At affordable dentures I didnt have to explain over and over and I felt like they actually listened to what I had to say. Making sure I left feeling good and very hopeful every time. I feel like I'm a family member being treated with so much ❤ care. Afordable dentures Helped me to  understand that the dental problems id been experiencing for years  was gum disease and types of problems like
that are mostly hereditary. So I always left the office  well informed and happier about my personal hygiene. Happy to say im 100% satisfied..thank you affordable dentures and staff family. Your staff in redding California is amazing. I recommend you 100%</Text>

Do not recommend going here!!!
My father came in to have his lower teeth removed and upper dentures replaced. He had had gold fillings in some of his teeth that had been removed.  After the procedure they tried to keep the gold fillings and refused him any pain medication, gauze, or anything after the surgery to take home with him. We had to demand that we get the teeth back and the front nurse tried to refuse release of them. We did finally get them from her.< /text>

Wasnt happy waited over an hour after appt. I had wrote on all paperwork that was told needed bonegraft due2 a hole in gum from usin glue 11 yrs 2 b able 2 chew. Had 2 intial all thru paperwork that i agreed 2 their prices that may not b covered? Gal took xrays and had me pick color which was yellow. So 2 get shade higher 1# was $100. Outta pocket didn't ask any thing about why i was there? It was an assistant 2. Was told 2 go home and wait 4 call after ins approves new dentures?. Was totally 😕 confused? Seen by no dentist at all no discussion wth either? Felt like cattle hurryup get branded and move on? I'd b in same boat wthout fixin the problem more glue? ⏫😲😮< /text>

Thank you for the dental work.  Everyone at affordable dentures and implants was knowledgeable and helpful. The extraction and implants were done so expertly and quickly that I didn't have time to get anxious before the work was completed. I look forward to my next appointment knowing my dental work will be done by the same high standards.</Review>

<Text>After being referred to this office by Dr Lee, they were able to get my father in law in right away-advise us what could be done after x-rays were taken. Great staff (friendly and professional.) Once My father in law heals up and an authorization has been obtained he will be going back to get his dentures. I would recommend this office to everyone!!</Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Absolutely terrible. I went in for my very first appointment and I will never go back. I asked several times about their procudures and the lady who never introduced herself so I don't know if she was the dentist, the assistant, or the receptionist. She did not explained the process to having their service. I was so uncomfortable that I simply walked out.<//text><resp>None< /resp>< rate>

They were so sensitive to their patents feelings for some dentures are an emotional experience. I am excited for my beautiful new smile thanks to the staff at Redding, California.  Affordable Dentures</review>

The manager who dealt with us at the front desk was a wonderful person who I felt has the customers best interest.  The injections I received were brutal and it was one of the roughest procedures I have gone threw.  After that the operation went smoothly.</Text>

< Review>
They gave me an appt for July 15, now they say office isn’t open until July 22 !!  Now I can’t get ahold of them every way there is to contact them, I’ve been on hold hours.   Still no human , still no appt .   Infected nerve in my mouth, causing sinus infections as well.   They don’t deserve any stars, I’m livid in pain and sick of being sick.   I’ve done all I can to get my appt< /Review>

<text>The only issue that I had with the whole process was getting approval!! Once all that process got done with had my teeth within a day and a half and that's only because I couldn't come back that evening to pick up the first time. Had Dentures for 25 years these fit better in the bite on them is outrageous! Thank you very much I tell everybody!< /text>< pics>

They were very professional and accompanying ! Great job ! The only thing I would say is they pulled all my top teeth! I read on the price before I came there plus it’s posted in the wall ! I had 8 front top teeth that took like 20 seconds a piece  and still got charged 125.00 each ! Those teeth we easy easy and I think that they should have been the 75.00 ! I understand the 2 top larger teeth but not the bottom !! I’m on a fixed income ! So was kinda shocked 🙈🙈</Text>

After reading the website and speaking with a representative at the 1-800 number I must admit that I was skeptical. I couldn't quite believe that I could be examined, have teeth extracted and walk out with partials or full dentures in the same day. It happened though. The people there made me feel comfortable right away and provided me with all the information that I needed. I highly recommend this facility to anyone needing some new teeth.< /text>

I have been calling twice a day for 3 days and put on hold for 30+ minutes before giving up.  I need my dentures  worked on! But I guess  once they get your money  that's all they care about. Why can't we just call our local office to make an appointment?< /Review>

I was impressed by the professional staff that thoroughly explained what could be done with my case.  I went in there thinking there wasn't much hope for my situation.  The assistant to the dentist, April, was so knowledgeable and experienced with similar patients, that she assured me I was not a hopeless case and there was a solution. They gave me a plan of action, affordable financial estimate, and said they could begin the process the following day.  They have a highly skilled dental lab tech on site who offers state-of-the art techniques and products.  I highly recommend this office for dental needs of all kinds.< /text>

<review>I am very happy with how my dentures turned out. They feel good and look great. The only problem I had was not being able to get ahold of them. Trying to schedule my appointment for my impressions and extractions took almost 4 months because they never answered their phone and after approximately 10 messages that I left on the answering machine they finally returned my phone call. If you live close by so you can go into the office it will be fine, but I live about an hour and a half away so I was unable to do that. The staff was nice and the Dentist was nice once you got past her sternness. Over all it was a good experience. Now I can proudly smile for the first time in several years!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<review>As someone who is fairly new in the state, they did everything they could to make sure I knew all of my options along the way. The procedure was timely and fairly painless. The staff worked hard to provide a friendly and stress free environment. I would recomend them to anyone who needs denture work.</review>< userid>

They did a great job with my dentures. I'm completely satisfied with the results. Natural looking, perfect proportions​ and a great fit.
I would recommend this place to anyone looking for quality and a reasonable price.
Updated , after 3 years my dentures were due to be relined.   The office in Redding had recently gotten a new phone system,  and,  the website lists the corporate number instead of the one for that office...I booked the appointment a week ahead,  then when I was going to be a little late because of the train crossing being blocked, I tried to call and let them know that I was on my way.  The call was answered by someone at corporate office, who told me that there was no appointment,  it had been canceled!
I was already on the road, so I went to the office and managed to get in after a short wait. That part was OK. However, I don't think they were on top of their game after being closed for so long (COVID19).
The lining was a bit shabby, not enough time taken to polish it out,  which resulted in considerable pain for me. It feels like there are fine grains of sand embedded . Very painful and disappointing.  I have no choice but to go back again to see what can be done!
Next day...the woman that took my impressions both times is wonderful. It was a little bit busy, of course, but she polished it out and I am now 100% satisfied...</review>

Redding office has great people and excellent dentist and techs...I know you wont get better work anywere else in town for dentures...but only deal with the Redding office for Apointments...if you dont you are in for a major headache and will leave this place hating them and there service....the phone jockey at national line have absolutely no clue of when or how to schedule appointments for the office...they are the one major downfall to using Affordable dentures...and it can be hard to get in contact with...makes me kinda hate recomending you guys to this person who dealt with this mess...sorry but truth hurts< /review>

<Review>Very unprofessional!
I went for my initial consult and waited 2 hrs before I gave up and rescheduled. Went back and got in within 30 mins, but dr never looked in my mouth. I advised her that I either wanted a repair or a new denture. She said that she needed to get approval from insurance and she would call me when it came in. Six weeks later, I get a letter from Denti-Cal that I’d been denied. According to them, Dr didn’t include a complete treatment plan. TWO WEEKS LATER, I get another letter saying I’d been denied again!
Two weeks after that, Affordable Dentures calls me to come in for another consult. This was about 10 wks from my consult appt.
I go to the appt., get into the chair and about 15 mins later here comes the dr. She sits down for about 5 mins. and starts asking me questions about my teeth. Suddenly, she gets up in mid conversation, leaves the room, Then comes back to the door twice and leaves because she left my file somewhere else. The whole time she was gone, I could hear her talking with other folks and she truly made me feel like my business didn’t matter to her. I walked out. Now I’m lookin for another dentist who might appreciate my business. I wouldn’t touch these folks with a 10 ft pole.</Review><user_id>105496133668892226572<//user_id><Date>1558651283300<//Date><Rating>1< /Rating>< gmap_id>

< review>
My name is joshua carmack and I tried to have two of my teeth removed that have been causing me headaches for the last few months and they told me that they wouldn't do it. She said they were perfectly done and that they'll last forever. THE AMALGAM teeth i have, have not been cap and have been leaking mercury, they are infected as well. I really need these teeth out, I have been getting ever increasing headaches. At first they said they would do it but when it came down to it they back out. I don't understand why, if my teeth were causing me my problems and I was going to pay for it why would you tell me you can't. Don't you take out ever tooth for dentures anyway. Especially if they were causing problems?? The girls were very sweet but didn't want to help me.< /review>

Young lady up front was very nice,definitely need more staff!! I was told my appt was over a month out due to prior auth from insurance. I went to appt,waited about 2 hrs to be seen 5 mins and was told another 1-2 months for prior auth from insurance again?! Felt ladies were to rushed to spend adequate time with each patient in back rooms. Left upset, now waiting to hear back from insurance as to why things fell through.<//Text>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>Very poor service. I went in way back in September. Not only was i made to wait an hour past my appointment time, but the dentist didn't even listen to my wants and concerns, only cared about what she wanted to do. Also I was told that I would get a call back in 2 weeks from that consultation to make an appointment to get the procedure done. I'm STILL waiting for that call</Text>< Pics>

<Review>I am very happy and thankful for Reddings, Affordable Dentures. I have been searching for a dentist whom I could afford and have been so disappointed and frustrated, I had all but given up until... My sister in-law went to Redding dentist. I was sceptical, uninterested in her appt. Until I saw her beautiful set of Dentures! All in one day at a VERY reasonable, affordable price. She gave me their card and now I have a beautiful set of pearly whites. Thank you, Dr Li Hou and affordable Dentures. My smile is back and beautiful! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM.<//Review>< Rating>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent staff. Each one was caring and efficient. Even though I had only an appointment for a consultation, the dentist was very empathetic with the plight of my disability and did her best to not only care for my discomfort (not associated with my teeth) and went out of her way to fit me in immediately. Thank you again Li Min Hou, and the rest of staff at the redding facility.< /Text>< Name>

<Review>My mom had an awful experience here. The lady was so rude and made her feel like everything was her fault. Horrible horrible. She went back multiple times and the dentist was very wishy-washy about what should be done. She made her pay twice, even though the first pair never fit. We went to an appointment after the 6th time of getting adjustments and the dentists would not even see us. She had her assistant, who is very nice and understanding, tell her that a refund would be the best option for her and that she would have to give back all the teeth they had made, besides a broken pair (all of which didn't fit), and she would have to take her money somewhere else. We were told that her case was more extensive and the dentist didn't have time to deal with such a case. She also told my mom that she was "puposely " messing up her bite during molds so she would have to keep remaking them. This us the epitome of horrible customer service and there is no accountability.  Do not let your loved ones come here.<//Review>< user_name>

<text>AVOID AT ALL COST! LI HOU IS ABHORRENT. While some of the staff(the ones you meet before they take your money) are very good, overall service is literally hell. Chose this place because the dentists where I live were unable to get me in for the work I needed, not to save money. At that time the reviews i found were favorable, although a recent search has shown that that has changed drastically. Paid up front for full service. Li Hou barely speaks English, which wouldn't be a problem if she was actually trying to listen to you, which she isn't. She is downright violent in her handling, acts put out by your very presence, wields her hands like seal clubs, egotistical to the extreme. They will not make appointments for basic adjustments and checkups that were already paid for. Teeth literally fall out if i open my mouth, and do not align in a way that makes it possible to eat. At one point she even flipped out and started yelling at me because she misunderstood a suggestion that she MAY have made a mistake, and told me to leave her office and not come back... Which she retracted fairly quickly once i began recording her insane ego rant and threatened a lawsuit. have been screwed around with by them for a year and two months, at enormous cost(17k), and still don't have working teeth... really, haven't eaten a solid meal in over a year. May see her in court. I feel insulted, disrespected, hurt and hungry. Spare yourself and anybody you care about the hell of this facility. The only good thing I have to say is that the assistant April is one of the most friendly and caring professionals one could imagine, although she has no real authority. I hope she gets work someplace more respectable and humane. Li Hou is, in short, a monster and a quack.</text>< Response>

UPDATE 2/10/2017 JUST LOST ANOTHER TOOTH (FRONT) AN HOUR AGO! I DO BELIEVE IT IS TIME TO CONSULT AN ATTORNEY!
If I could give no stars I most definitely would! Worst experience I have ever had in my 63 years! I had a complete custom upper plate made to replace one I had made when I lived in the Philippines and they were five + years old, BUT I only paid $100 for them and they fit great! The dentist at the Redding clinic was rude and would not listen to what I wanted and did what she wanted instead which caused me to have to wait two weeks for her and staff to return from vacation. After they returned on June 15, 2016 I was told I had to make an appointment for adjustment so I made an appointment for the 17th at 8:00 am. After we sat there in the waiting room for almost two hours, they finally came and took me to one of the rooms to wait for the dentist. When she came back to see what I needed I explained that I was in need of an adjustment and had to wear my old dentures to eat because the new upper would not stay in. After sitting in the dental chair another forty five minutes the dentist came back and says; We are too busy today to adjust your denture so you will need another appointment tomorrow. We showed up again on the 18th at 8:00 am and we sat for almost 2 hours again then after I was called to go to a dental room I sat in there over an hour before anyone came to see what I needed. After I explained what was needed I sat another 45 minutes. All in all I sat in that room a total of 3 hours plus the waiting room time and I still did not get what I asked for and they rip you off by making you pay in advance. I wasted $665.00 at this terrible facility and a lot of time. I would not recommend this place to anyone especially those on a fixed income! If you complain they make it seem like it is your fault for their 3rd rate business practices. Plus she would chew out her staff in front of customers for everyone to hear. Many patients left those 2 days because of excessive waiting and told to come back another time. I forgot to mention that  I had to pay $90 for x rays I did not need!  Plus I had a Free $25 consultation card that my sister gave me which as a new customer I was to get a Free complete consultation. I never received a consultation, none at all! I was so livid I could have exploded especially after 4 months one of the eye teeth on my brand new custom upper plate fell out while I was eating a cheese sandwich and before I knew it, I swallowed the damned thing! No I didn't look for it Lol! Still wearing my old denture. If I had the money I would sue this establishment in a heart beat.< /text>

I do not like them. I went back several time to have them adjusted, and they still are not fitting comfortably. They are heavy, bulky and go to far and hit the gag reflex.  I am truly unhappy with this.</text>

Horrible. The woman barely speaks English, and she pushes and pushes to get more tests, x-rays, unnecessary procedures done to rack up the bill. She's extremely rude, and instead of working one on one with a patient, she works on 3 at a time! Running back and forth from cubicle to cubicle. Once she figured out she wasn't going to rack up the bill, she starting being sloppy and almost broke the dentures. Extremely disappointed!! Don't make the same mistake we made by going here!!< /review>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>Very bad service , we had appointment extraction at 9 am but still we had to wait till 10 am for x-ray. After that they did x-ray and said they are busy and told us to come back at 2:30 even tho we were the first one there. They were very rude and didn't even feel sorry for keep us waiting and still not done with extraction. I am never going back there again and would not recommend that place for anyone.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x54d2ecccf68a364d:0xffe8ca5f3b35db3d<//GmapID></record>

Wait time is horrible,  hour and a half,  before you get called back to a room, and at least 20 to 25 minutes after that you see the dentist.< /Text>

Tried the new strawberry breeze because it was recommended. VERY good soomthie that should be added to the menu regularly. this jamba is always very quick. And the manger is very knowledgeable about what is inside each smoothie or drink.</review>

I didn't know what my drink was called that I get from time to time, but she helped me make one. She was friendly, And was not rushing me or giving me attitude. This was the tastiest one I have had.
Would go there again.</Review>

Love this location. I've tried others and it's just not the same. Every morning I send my order and it's always ready on time with my extra over fill in a separate cup. Great service, great drinks! Don't change a thing. I couldn't ask for better...<//Text>

<Time>1597867511104</Time><Review>I ordered through the app and the wait time said 15 minutes. I waited 15 minutes and saw two walk up orders be served before I got out to ask about my order by that time it was 17 minutes after I placed the order. The employee says I’ll have to wait another 15 minutes because I ordered oatmeal and it’s not ready yet. Huge waste of time ordering through the app at this location. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and return after I had been charged twice from this location on a single order but that was a mistake.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

To all you Jamba fans... they have a whole new lineup of bowls. Today I tried the Nutty Bowl and it was refreshing as are all their bowls. I sat in my car reviewed their entire menu at my leisure paid via the app and walked in to pick up my order less than 10 minutes after. Oh happy day!!!</Review>

< review>
Had not been to Jamba Juice in a long time, so when I get there I order a "Power" size drink. The cashier didn't know what I was talking about so she went out if her way asked another girl. (Named, Melissa, I don't know her position, but looking into other reviews on this page someone called her a GM) Melissa responded very rudely for everyone to hear, "I don't know why people still call it that, it is a Large". Bottom line is, she needs to fix her attitude. I would gladly change my review if action is taken and she is disciplined for having a sorry attitude at work. When my order was ready, I asked the guy who gave me my order for her name and she heard me and obnoxiously yells "Melissa, have a good day"! So unprofessional! Her behavior is unacceptable, I really hope her boss says something to her about this, and if she is the GM she shouldn't be.</review>

Service is always fast waiting room always clean. They have food and drink for everyone. Drinks for kids. Drinks if you need energy drinks for health. I always like to get mine double Blended because there seems to be some chunks and it's nice and smooth that way. They never have a problem double blending it.<//Review>

Was there last night, and the girl who took my order, Melissa T. Was extremely rude. She basically threw my change at me and threw our açaí bowls at us too. I’m not sure if she was having a bad day or whatever, but never have I encountered such a sour and unpleasant personality. The drinks and açaí bowls were watery and badly made. Not going back to this location.<//text>

I am from out of town and wanted to have my favorite jamba smoothie..however the manager Melissa ruined my whole experience. She was extremely rude and with unexcusable attitude. Her customer service etiquette will not be visited by me or my familiy again. The smoothie we purchased was great but she was very distasteful. Good luck To you all.<//text>

Melissa the store manager is so rude and aggressive. I will never return to this store. My coworkers and I usually make jamba runs but after Melissa's attitude and my experience, we have collectively decided to just stick to Starbucks. Sad because I really do love jamba juice and their oatmeal but Melissa is so negative and seems to really hate her job.. she made me feel so uncomfortable that I can never step foot in the location again.<//review></record>

<text>Just went in. The drink was great! But the customer service was really bad I felt so uncomfortable waiting for my drink...
I walked in and I was the only one in there. The girl looked at me like she was upset because I wanted to order something.  To kill that silence between us I asked her how her day was when I handed her the money and her response was "fine, yours?" (Obviously she didn't care to know) She then handed me my money and started making my drink..
I felt uncomfortable once I walked in. She wasn't welcoming at all and I felt bad because I wanted to order something.. maybe she was having a bad day.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>I went with my family. We're regular customers. I ordered my usual orange supreme large  and large strawberry whirl and strawberry were ok I give to my kids and when I started drinking mine that was something else I asked her is this orange supreme she said to me oh I am sorry  I make you the right one so I started drinking the other one while waiting. Other employee came and asked me to return that drinks. I got shocked I ordered drinks they delivered wrong that was there mistake or fault.
I feel punished
I have to wait for my drink again in this 110 degree weather. Hoping they would understand they should have let me drink it that should have been the right thing as a policy
If the Jamba Juice employees making mistake and there mistakes customers has to wait customers deserve free drink while waiting
So I canceled my order
You lost business & I lost to take my family on your location</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Cheap tasty East Indian food! I really loved the chicken curry and chicken samosa. The chicken samosa comes with 2 very large generous sized pieces with  two sauces. The  manager will let you try all the curry in sample sizes ,so you know exactly what you are getting. I tried the goat curry, too. Yep! You heard it right, Goat curry! It had an interesting texture and flavor. If you ever have drank a glass of  goat milk you will understand what I mean.I recommend this place if you don't mind the casual cafeteria style dining.</review>

Indian fast food, this was good stuff.

Snagged a Chicken Tikka Burrito - Very flavorful; you can taste all the spices and seasonings. Instead of a typical Mexican tortilla, they used a slightly crispy naan (Indian flat bread) to flavored it to their own culture - good idea ;).

Orange Curry is a nice improvement alternative to the typical fast food chains.<//text>

This place is by far my favorite Indian restaurant in Anaheim, they give you so much value for the food and their food is always delicious. The three item combo is always enough for two whole meals. I also love that they serve all their containers in plastic instead of Styrofoam so you can just pop them in the microwave when you're ready to reheat them. I plan to order from them time and time again because it does not disappoint.<//Review>

I have dined in earlier at the Chapman Ave. location earlier a couple of times. This time I ordered online Chicken Biryani and Lamb Curry. Both were good. The pieces in Biryani were a little chewy but taste was good.</Text>

Food is really good and workers are very kind! Toddler spilled new drink and being to get teary but didnt fuss. Cashier noticed & replaced it for free! They were soo nice about it & they were quick in cleaning and refused our help to clean. Of course we were embarrassed but they tried to make us feel better. I really appreciated that and when given extra tip both were humble and rejected it. Eventually they gav in after our prying lol but really great place! I highly recommend it!</Review>

<Review>Great food, full of flavor, and excellent value -- all containers are heaped 100% full for a reasonable price. We've enjoyed every dish we've gotten, and all the briyanis and the eggplant have particularly been showstoppers. After trying several local Indian spots for delivery during COVID, this is now our go-to place.< /Review>< pics>

Great food rivaling some of the more expensive Indian restaurants in the area.
Great service, great people who aim to make sure you receive a great meal at a great price.
A treasure located in a very non-descript and modest strip mall.
I do not believe you will be disappointed but be careful with some of the dishes as they are made fresh and may be a little spicy at times.
They have sweet lassie which is made fresh but you have to order it while the mango and rose lassi are also made fresh but are in the cooler.  I discovered them when my son told us about them, they have become a couple of times a week habit.</review>

Employee serving food asked us to wait to take a phone order and removed his mask to talk on the phone. As well as two members of the kitchen staff wearing mask under their chin. I have eaten here in the past before the pandemic and was pleased with the service and food but was disappointed to find they don’t take this pandemic seriously.  Good luck orange curry< /review>< rate>

Good. Little hole in the wall place but food was good. I was attending a conference and found this place close by so ended up eating there all three days! The Vegetable Korma was very good. Also tried the Daal Makhani which was good as well. Nice guy who was there each day. A bit hard to understand from a language barrier, and I'm sure the mask covering his mouth didn't help, but he was quite pleasant.< /review>

Good authentic Indian food, cheap prices, clean atmosphere, and friendly staff. I had the black pepper chicken curry and the goat curry, both were really tasty and the nice cashier even made it to be more spicy to suit my taste. I will be coming back more often to try out everything they have to offer.</text>

<Text>The food is so good. At first, I wasn't sure because I never had Indian food before and didn't know what to order, but now I can't decide what to get because every dish is good even the veggie sides! Portions are great too just like the Chinese restaurant next door. Try it you'll become a regular!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80dcd7cca2ac1897:0xd7b91827e5f72fe8< /GmapID></record>

BEST CHICKEN MASALA!!! I eat at a lot of Indian restaurants and I had their 3 entree combo. The Goat Biryani, Chicken Masala and  Potato & Cauliflower with a side of Garlic Naan. I was blown away cause the food quality and quantity was amazing.<//text>

Hands down best vegan Indian food I've ever tried. They are not a full on vegan restaurant but offer a good amount of vegan options and (in my opinion) It's inexpensive too. I recommend the chickpea and cauliflower sides, they're really good. If you're vegan/plant-based, they can make the naan bread vegan if you ask and they also have vegan yogurt. 👍 💯<//Review>

Here on business in the OC and this nice hole-in-the-wall new restaurant was close, walking distance from Doubletree hotel - delicious & authentic. Reasonably if not inexpensively priced for filling portions. We had the black pepper chicken curry, chic pea, rice with the garlic naan - also had the goat curry, which is hard to get tender and flavorful and it was!!! Highly recommend.<//review>

Great Indian food.

They have both veg and non veg options.

To go preferred.

They do have few tables, you can dine in as well.<//Text>

<review>Food was extremely fresh, they give you samples so that you are happy with your order. The veggie choice are very delicious and the order of tikka masla was amazing, the fresh naan I used to soak up all the curry sause was just to perfect. A must not only if your short on time but overall. Ohh and the mango lassi was also a big hit.<//review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>The staff is very polite and you get service quickly. Unfortunately, their hours are not regular or dependable. They were closed already tonight at 6pm. They used to be open until 10 pm.  It would be nice if one could depend on reliable hours. Too bad they're only open for one day.</Review><rate>4< /rate><user>109264904631784529611</user><gmapID>0x808fa30ebe524fb1:0x9094c2eea52b5230< /gmapID>< Time>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I only wanted a taco and they did not want to sell me, they are at least 3, I ordered an extra plate and they sold it to me, I wanted to pay with a card and I did not. I ordered ice and they did not have it and they only had like 3 meats. The tacos do not taste ugly but a lot of sangronada do not believe 🤔🤨

It's one of those days where I am craving a good latte.
.
The first time  I came here saw the seasonal sign and lavender latte caught the corner of my eye. So I had to give it a try. The honey lavender oat milk latte was good. Since It was a warm day they made it ice. They do have oat, almond, and regular milk options.
.
Second time I had tried the regular unsweetened ice latte. It was very good. The espresso was strong and well balanced. I had regular milk with it.
.
Overall the experience was helpful with the barista. The cashiers is patient and answer questions about drinks inquire. The inside is so cute and I love how we can enjoy the comfort. As well outside has some bright yellow chairs. I have a great time each time I come here. Thanks for reading and have a yelptastic day!</Text>

<Review>This store is incompetent of serving customers with respect and dignity that they ask for themselves. It’s not kind to embarrass any customer in front of all other customers for absolutely no reason. Especially the “manager” from the Davis office, in my opinion, he needs to go or possibly just stay in Davis. I have never, ever, had so much disrespect from one person much less someone who thinks so highly of himself.< /Review><name>Stacia Jay</name>< Response>

<Text>As a customer I observed very unprofessional behavior and poor leadership from the owner.  There was fault on my side admittedly, however, the situation was handled in a way that did not have to escalate in the way it ensued.

The event which transpired was not of severity equivocal to the reaction acquired.  It is understandable that individuals may experience days emotionally insurmountable to them leading to diffuse behavior.  However, it does not necessitate certain behavior.

The individual, who I presume is the business owner, was very aggressive and physically intrusive.  He stood 1-2 feet of where I was sitting and raised his voice while using obtrusive and volatile language.  His voice was inherently loud enough to be heard from the inside of the coffee shop.  He continued to berate my friend and I until he finally decided to walk away while shouting an explicit statement.  Then on, my friend and I decided to leave as the situation which transpired left us feeling uncomfortable.

However, the coffee and product/s were of great quality and taste.  Additionally, the charitable cause of the organization is one to admire, albeit, unprofessional behavior and poor leadership.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Pachamama stands out as one of my favorites in a city littered with coffee shops. They have a great open space with different types of seating for groups, pairs or individuals looking to get a little work done. The coffee is not only top notch, they are farmer owned and results in a better balanced business from one end to the other. The baristas all have their own unique personality while still providing you great service. It's also one of the few spots where you can bring your dog inside with you, just make sure it's well behaved so you don't ruin it for others 😊 Pachamama just has a lot of wonderful character and delicious coffee.< /Review><user_name>Tevis Pieper</user_name>< rating>

<username>Anastasiya Lyashenko< /username><Text>Visited this location several times and have consistently enjoyed my drinks and the atmosphere. The baristas are kind and helpful. I do wish there was a couch or more softer searing but whatever the coffee is great. Even the latte was excellent, not too milky. I usually get a cappuccino, but the chai and mocha are also great. Would recommend  to study here, usually quiet here in the evening and they close at 7.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Without going into details, we made a mistake and we take ownership of that, but instead of him talking to us professionally about what upset him, he proceeded to use profanity and berate us in front of other customers. My biggest concern here is how he handled this situation. He was confrontational and when we explained it was an unintentional misunderstanding, he still used vulgar language and didn’t even provide a solution to the whole ordeal. He came to us wanting to exert condescending energy and at one point it felt like he wanted to fight us... again this is in front of his employee and other customers. I felt really threatened and when he walked away he continued to mutter profanity under his breath.

My worry is that if he can treat paying customers this way, how is he treating his employees or even the rest of pachamama team (locally and internationally) I would greatly appreciate if he read this and realized that as a business owner you are always on stage and how you present yourself is important to the longevity of your business and the continued support of the community. Hope he understands and learns to better control his anger when confronted with a tough situation.< /Review><UserId.>112488540313925022770</UserId.><Rating>1<//Rating><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Name>

I got the cold brew coffee, my wife hot coco with oak cream, and the kids regular hot coco.  I had the luxury of tasking the hot Coco with oak cream and that was the best milk alternative hot coco I ever have in life.  In addition my cold brew hit the spot. I was able to taste the strong roast, but not bitter.</Review>

The first time that I came to this place and honestly I will be going every chance I get. It's about 1 mile from work so it's not too far away. Let me tell y'all - they have the best latte I've ever had. I got a small iced sweetened latte with oat milk. It comes with two shots and it was the smoothest latte I've ever had. I always get my drinks with oat milk if available or almond. Highly recommend this place, baristas are very friendly. You won't regret spending your entire paycheck here.</Review>

This is one of my favorite coffee shops in Sacramento. They’re probably the last ones that does pour overs without using a Seraphim. Also, I love that they’re very dog-friendly.

Try the cold brew, cold brew lemonade, and pour over.</Text>

I love this coffee and buy it regularly; however, I have one issue with the pricing of whole beans. The printed public price sheet states that decaf French is $16/lb and the French is $15/lb. I always purchase a 1/2 lb of each and have them mixed together. When I pay, I am charged $16.50, which is $1.00 more than what I believe I should be charged according to the price sheet. When I discussed this with the a very nice employee, I was told that I was charged what the computer says is the correct amount even though the printed price sheet is shows a lesser price. I know it’s only a dollar, but They need to get their pricing (computer and printed) coordinated.<//text>

I rely on Starbucks for consistently good and convenient coffee.  Pachamama is where I buy consistently excellent coffee sourced from family owned organic farms all over the world.  It tastes amazing because it's freshly roasted on site, and it feels good to drink it because I know I'm supporting farmers making a fair wage for their products.  The staff here is wonderful, knowlegable and helpful.  They are so excited to tell you the story of your coffee from seed to cup.  I make a trip downtown every weekend just to visit Pachamama, and I highly recommend everyone else do the same.</Text>

Pachamama is the best coffee in Sacramento. That's saying a lot but worth every penny and you will feel really good about where your coffee comes from. Cruz and Max are extremely knowledgeable and friendly! Try it, you won't regret your decision!</Review>

<Review>They've really killed it on the interior design. Very open concept and modern yet ties in the history with the raw unfinished brick. The tables are upside down versions of our local bridges, with the tower bridge being the large table. The fans look like airplane propellers.

It seems like you need to know what coffee lingo is to visit here. They were patient with my toddler as he tried to run around and get his own water from the self-serve container. The music was old school and awesome. They should probably ask of it's our 1st time and give some explanations before we ordered to get a sense of the customer and their needs (it was our first time). The almond milk vanilla bean latte was not sweet but was smooth and tasted good. Could add some sweetener after. That's what I would do next time. The decor was cute and simple.</Review>

I've never seen such a large selection of coffee, actual coffee, not syrups or flavorings. Definitely my favorite coffee house. Also the only farmer owned importer and distributor in the United States so you know the farmers are paid fairly. Just received my order of espresso beans and I can't wait to start brewing Pachamama coffee at home.</Text>

Parking can be sometimes hard to find, but there's a lot of streets nearby with free 2 hour parking. Coffee is great, service is great, environment is very chill and it never gets as busy as the more popular shops in downtown (i.e. temple, insight, chocolate fish, etc.). It's a good place to do work or get homework done.<//text>

And yesterday it just so happened their system was down so they only accepted cash. It was a bummer. Luckily, my co-worker had cash so I could purchase the beans. They grind the beans for you there too. it's a cool warehouse to see how the beans are packed.By the way, they are hidden in the alley way and this place is a real gem. They have great prices on really tasty beans. Lots of options to choose from and they also have a café at a different location too. The guy said, they will be opening a café at this location later in the fall.

I'm definitely going back to buy the beans there<//text>< pictures>

Good organic coffee, fair trade. Not as affordable as your "gourmet" grocery store coffee (Starbucks, Peets, etc) but I'm willing to pay a premium to know that the farmers aren't getting stiffed. Most of their beans run from $14 to $18 a pound, light to dark roast, and they have a few decaf options.

Not a coffee shop - they only sell beans and coffee accessories (grinders,  french presses, etc). Warehouse setting, it looks like they do all their roasting and packaging on premises, but I haven't clarified. They do have pre-packaged beans available, but it's a better deal to fill a bag yourself - I think the pre-packaged beans are only 10 oz but cost as much as a pound of the bulk coffee. They also have half pound bags which is nice if you don't want to commit to a whole pound of something you've never tired before.<//Review>

The $8 Coffee tin w/ beans through LivingSocial is very nice. I'm looking forward to trying the coffee. The original plan was to purchase coffee beans and to buy a cup of coffee to try. Unfortuantely, they do not brew coffee here. Then the guy tells me that I needed to call to redeem the coupon before I get the tin w/ beans. But that turned out to be wrong... If you go in with the LivingSocial deal, just tell'em Molly said so.<//Review>

I wish they did fruit smoothies though. Very friendly customer service and good prices for their good looking fruit. They have a parking lot as well as clean restrooms. Most importantly, Their fruit tastes amazing.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMY4tSlvn9an0A4ZZnFIobfnm6BdLEO0pfx4XBK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_DtH4LBpqA3qMfk-ZxF_cNSnsybCMCSDmugjl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnRK_oC2jTSRwMa9EKNurUkbuW20fciuP109L3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6P6Im-Zq4vGwA2VV-zLekT37fhpPcLz4E89X9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

Always a family favorite! The employees are always helpful and friendly. My family loves the produce and baked goods.  I buy all of my fresh fruit and veggies here because they are always fresh and great quality. It's so nice to have peaches and tomatoes that actually taste like peaches and tomatoes!!< /Review>

I come from Livermore all the way to Shadelands (Walnut Creek) to hit up this vendor. What sets these guys apart from other vendors is their consistency. They rarely miss. Nectarines as sweet as candy almost every time.< /text>

They have the best tasting fruits and vegetables with lots of varieties. They have a sample tray set up with the different fruits labeled so you know what you're trying. They taste amazing and I was able to buy with confidence knowing I was getting excellent produce. Their donut peaches are the best! I had also grabbed a bag of corn nuts to eat along the way and discovered they were the best I've ever tasted, not as hard as usual corn nuts and so much flavor. My friend and I were traveling from Hanford, CA to Mendocino, CA and went out of our way by quit a bit just to stop here...that's how good it is!<//Text>

So nice to get and go to J & J and get fruit and vegetables
Everything looked so good and the store is so nice now after the remodel.
Plus they carry milk from a local dairy...I got some, love supporting local farmers.</Text>

I Shopper during the summer months I look for boysenberries, blackberries they didn't have any this last summer I was very disappointed. But I went a little further up and another Stan had them for 18 to $20 a pack so I bought several and put them in my freezer after I wash them. I did buy it lots of other produce peaches apricots plums Tomatoes which they have a very nice selection of heirloom tomatoes that no one else has. I had to wait quite a while to get the Watermelons with the seeds in it because I don't eat seedless watermelon. Other than that I go there all the time and they have a nice Bakery I recommend it.< /Text>

Awesome place! They have turnovers that are light and flaky and taste great! They sell out everyday in the summer. They have a great selection of in season fruits and produce and things like honey etc. This is a great store in the country near the city of Hughson on Geer Rd. Recommended!!< /review>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Delivery type white truck 12/10/19 at 530am leaving tracy area all the way through Pleasanton with company name, city and  CA license number completely a reckless driver who needs to be fired. Man was driving at time above in fast lane, swerving in and out of the shoulder over and over causing massive amounts of rocks and debris to hit the cars behind him. Driving at high rate of speed until on the car in fronts tail, then slamming on brakes. this man drove in the should over and over from tracy all way through Pleasanton once I passed him he continued to gas it at high rate of speed until right on top on me then slow down, over and over. I thought he would run into the back of my car. Plus the amount of rocks he kicked up by swerving repeatedly into the shoulder caused rock chips to my 3 month old car.
Completely reckless irresponsible danger of driver of the road  I suggest finding out who this man is and terminating hi .<//review>< Resp>

Fabulous selection of fruit...nectarines, plums, pluots, and peaches to name a few.  First time shopper and I really appreciated the fact that they had 3 cases of cling peaches ready for me when I arrived after I called ahead.  The cling peach season is short and these are by far and away the most beautiful, golden peaches I have ever purchased!  The young ladies attending the fruit stand were courteous and professional and very knowledgable.  Fabulous produce and incredible prices.</Text>

i work at PrintTime in Modesto and my boss got two small peach pies which were the BEST ive ever had.  I HATE PIE... but wow did they change my expearience with pies. You can still taste all the freshness in the fruit with each bite. Had to google where they are... theyre a distance away :( at least for me. they should have a delivery system. i'd have they're baked goods each morning if i could.< /Text>

We have been dine in only customers for years. Due to the new safer at home restrictions, we have been cooking at home. Tonight, we needed a break. We ordered through their website, and our food was ready in 25 minutes. It was even better than the last time we dined in. My chicken wrap was moist, and the salad was super fresh. The gyro wrap was full of tender lamb and the mixed kebabs were perfectly cooked. The fries and rice were perfect too. Everything was packaged nicely and as always the service was friendly. I highly recommend this local spot.</review>

Wraps weren’t great. Pita wasn’t toasted (or even warm), sauce was dripping everywhere, and they totally fell apart.</review>

I  love this place without a doubt. Clean dining area and spacious. I always go here for dinner when I stay at work late. I always order the same plate which is number 28 on their menu a mix of three different meats (chicken, beef, and lamb), jasmine rice, salad, hummus, and pita bread. The combo and it always satisfies me every time I order it; its a big plate for big eaters such as myself. The have vegan options too for vegan eaters or health conscious folks. They are fast too so do not worry waiting too long. Great customer service, they bring the food to you. Bathroom is not the best but I mainly go for the food which they have not disappoint. Recommend colleagues to check this place out.< /review>

<text>This is definitely the best place to go for affordable, fresh fish. They'll even cut it the fish for you if you ask, and I believe it may actually be cheaper to do that rather than ordering it straight from the menu.<//text></record>

I honestly have to say that for me it didn't do much for my palate. Presentation was nice, served more than enough food (had left overs for two days) but something seasoning wise was missing. First timer by the way, I'd try again maybe ordering something else other than a combo plate; stick to one type of meat.< /Review>

Ordered a chicken shawarma. You get 2 small pitas. Kind of pricey for what you get ($8.99+tax). Tasted alright. Don't get to pick what's on it.< /review>

<Text>If you want FOOD POISONING and RUDE MANAGEMENT, this is YOUR place!
I live very close to Pita Café. The food's not great, but good enough. I used to eat there often -- that is until the chicken shawarma gave me FOOD POISONING. I called to let the management know -- maybe keep from getting closed down by the Health Department? The response was this jerk, the "general manager," calling me a LIAR! I immediately filed a complaint against this cesspool with the LA County Health Department. Hopefully, this place will get closed down before someone gets really sick from their tainted food.
Go to the Zankou Chicken across the street for better food & better service.</Text>< GmapID>

< Review>
The food has been great but the guest service has not been. Today I went there after work and there was an older man smoking a cigarette outside and walked into the restaurant and ask if the man in the brown shirt works there and they asked me who I was. I said I was a customer who witnessed him him smoking a cigarette and walked in. They said no. The man in the brown shirt walked out and looked around and went back inside to organize chairs. I'm never coming back because EMPLOYEES OR OWNERS SHOULD NEVER SMOKE IN FRONT OF THEIR RESTURAUNT!!</Review>

<Text>Not vegan friendly Falafel guy working there was very rude when he messed up my order and put ranch on the pita and lied about telling me there's ranch on their falafel also yogurt in tahini sause. That being said it looked good so props to the cook but bad service all around surprised he even gave me my money back.</Text>< pictures>

<review>Good customer service, but I can't remember a time where I ate Mediterranean food and left unsatisfied especially if I was eating shawarma except here in this place, however if you want a little spicy Mexican flavor too your food than this place can be enjoyable, but something about the Hamas just tasted wrong, I rather just eat sabra Hamas from Costco.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<review>Happy Birthday to me!  My daughter ordered an arrangement to be delivered for my birthday on the 12th. Still hasn't arrived. Like the others, she can't reach anyone at the store. She's contacted the Better Business Bureau. Now she has to try to get her money back.</review>< Name>

Very upset I had ordered a Mother’s Day arrangement that never showed up. No one answers their phone. No way of contacting them directly. After 4 days of trying to see what happened to my gift I gave up and put it through my bank to dispute the charge. Very disappointed in the horrible service. Won’t be ordering from again. Beware.

Your tracking info said my Mother’s Day arrangement was being made by the “professional fruit experts” it’s still says that.. 5/20/21 what a joke!< /review>

AVOID THIS PLACE! Placed on online order April 28 to have something delivered on Mother's day and paid extra. Nothing ever arrived. I waited 3 extra days and still have yet to receive anything 🙄.  I've tried calling the store and no one answers. I've also tried the call center number but it just redirects my to the store that no one will answer at. AVOID THIS PLACE! I called my credit card company and they informed me that many people have been calling to about their edible arrangements not being delivered and not being able to get a hold of anyone.< /Text>

They get no stars! They are taking people's orders, not delivering and they are not in operation whatsoever. The phone is busy. The place is closed up during all open times posted. Angry notes taped all over the door. Lots of people are publicly making posts online stating these same facts. The corporate office says they are privately owned and they don't do a thing to prevent this from happening to lots of other people!</text>

This place doesn’t even deserve 1 star! I ordered a Mother’s Day basket for my mom. They guaranteed delivery Mother’s Day by 9pm. Nothing was ever delivered and still has not been delivered. I called the place several times and can’t get a hold of anyone. This is the worst customer service I’ve had with this company. I don’t know if it’s this location or all of California locations. I will NEVER recommend or buy anything from this place. The manager should be reviewing their reviews and step up the customer service. I wished I had read the reviews before I have ordered from them.< /text>

< Review>
Very disappointed 😞. Starting with the quality of the strawberries,  they are small and they don't look and taste any fresh, the whole arrangement was sweat specially the dipped strawberries. When I call the store this morning at 10AM they told me the arrangement was ready and they couldn't promise any delivery time.  It was delivered at 6PM. If the product lacks quality there is no way it will resist all those hours even if is kept in fridge. I had previous experiences with Edible Arrangement from different stores and this one is not looking nothing like the real good ones.<//Review>

Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever come across. Still haven’t got an email about a order that I purchased yesterday. I have called the store a numerous amount of times no answer. Giving up at this point, don’t go to this edible arrangements. Riverside plaza is where you should order from never had a problem there.</Text>

<Review>Highly Disappointed! Order was never delivered!
I ordered an arrangement the week prior to Mother’s Day to be delivered the day before Mother’s Day.  My order was never delivered.  After dozens of attempts to contact the store with no answer, I contacted their online customer service. A case was opened and I was promised the store would contact me the following day. They never contacted me. I then attempted to contact the store directly again and again, with no answer. As a last attempt to have my gift delivered, I contacted the customer service hotline and asked for delivery, even though the holiday had now passed. They assured me it would be delivered the following day.  I waited 3 more days in hopes to have the gift delivered. No delivery again! I had to file a PayPal claim to have my ordered refunded  today. PayPal immediately issued my refund, no thanks to the any cooperation from Edible Arrangements!<//Review></record>

Warning!!!!! Beware!!!! Order at your own risk. This place is terrible. I paid extra to have order delivered on mothers day unfortunately they were not delivered and still have not been delivered. When I call the store there is no answer and I am just placed on an endless loop of voicemail to voicemail I cannot get an actual person on the phone. When I track it online it just says order received by store. This isnt the first time this place did me dirty either last time the sent some less than fresh "moldy" strawberries but i thought maybe that was a one time hiccups.Well now we're here and I dont even know if my order will ever be delivered. So sad that they do people like this. This place is unprofessional dont waste your money here.<//review>

<Text>First time customer at Edible Arrangements. Had a Horrible experience, communicated early in the morning and wanted to customize  an arrangement for my husband, I didn't have my debit card with me at the moment I was calling. The lady said she would put me in the system so I could pick it up at approximately 4:00 - 4:30, when I got there the lady said she had no one in the system for that day. I am very upset, disappointed and she was being RUDE. I would rather wait in a line at Sees Candy then to ever order something at Edible Arrangements.</Text>< user_name>

<Review>Ordered these for my parent's anniversary.  They left it on the front porch....in the heat. The only reason the item wasn't ruined was because a neighbor, after calling, was kind enough to grab it for them.
If they want to leave expensive fruit and chocolate on the porch, in the heat, I will take my money and business elsewhere.<//Review><Date>1616941906546</Date>< user>

Worst customer service ever! They say they have called me multiple times and left voice-mails when they called once and left 1 voice-mail. I had no issue with picking up the arrangement later in the day but when I went to pick it up no one was there and no one was answering the phone. The voice-mail box was full so you can't even leave a voice-mail. Odds are I never get my arrangement and this was a complete waste of time!< /Review>

Every time I wanna surprise my girlfriend at work I hit these guys up and they always deliver. I really appreciate how great and juicy the fruit are (She adores the chocolate covered strawberries). From the detail to the design I really appreciate how they craft my order. Thank you< /text>

<Review>The worst customer service. I purchased a very expensive arrangement for my moms birthday, wanted it to be delivered to her job. I was promised same day delivery and I paid extra to have it delivered before 5. Obviously that didn’t happen, so when I called the customer service number the employee over the line hung up on me! I called several times after that and no one answered my call. I will be getting ahold of corporate to receive a refund!</Review>< Pics>

I ordered a gift for my brother for his birthday with a mylar baloon.  It came on time and was beautiful.  They were very pleased and surprised.  I would recommend this place to anyone needing a gift for someone.  Great, great quality.< /text>

Would give zero stars if possible. Order for my wife for mothers day and chose pick up due to them not giving a confirmed time of delivery. I get there and there were 40 people in line for pick up, some werent even wearing masks. I asked to cancel it and they were extremely rude about it and didnt help me after asking 4 times. DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE BUSINESS<//text>

< review>
We were the intended recipient of an edible arrangement. The delivery was delayed. They would not allow the sender to cancel the order because they had made one delivery attempt at 7:30PM at night and missed us. If they would have called us, we were 2 minutes away. We tried to contact them but they would not or could not answer their phone. Their voicemail was full so you could not leave a message. There were repeated promises it would be delivered but no results.  I eventually had to go pick up the arrangement from the store location after 4 days of waiting for it to show up at our home which is under 15 minutes from the store. It was a good learning experience for me to never use this company if I wanted to send someone a gift. Very sad.<//review>

Really bad service,y 84 year old mother went on to the Whittier location on 2/11 for delivery on 2/14, she spent over $100.00 on a basket and the item was NEVER SENT!  When i contacted the location where the order was placed I was told they have till 8pm to deliver.  At this point who wants fruit at or after 8pm.  Never mind that the delivery NEVER ARRIVED!  Edible  arrangements has failed an 84 year old Grandmother trying to Surprise her grandsons.  Response from Paul at Edible arrangements: was if not delivered  they will refund.   I am sorry That is not Acceptable!  Happy Valentine's Day!<//text>

<Review>I'm so annoyed with this damn place!  All started with an email on valentines day morning which applied as I procrastinated by waiting until the last minute on Valentine's Day to place an order!  Well went ahead and placed an order online at 9:30am, and paid $18 dollars for delivery lol.  I understand today is extremely busy, but asked if arrangement could be sent before 3pm.  I was hoping so, but if not I was personally going to drive from Anaheim to location to pick up to deliver myself, so that my fiance could have them before leaving work.  Damn place has their phone off the hook ALL DAY!  What manager or supervisor would allow for them to do that!  Again, my plan was to simply call for a status to determine if I should drive over.  Didnt want to drive close to 20 miles for nothing.  Now here I am on Valentines Day looking like a fool.  I will never order from Edible Arrangements again.  This is awful customer service, and you have officially ruined my day!< /Review>< user_name>

If there were minus stars I would give them that. We placed an order and it was lost in transit. Treasure the manager was extremely unhelpful trying to resolve the issue. She also verbally assulted me over the phone. Yelling and never letting me talk or ask questions. She was the extremely rude. When the delivery store tried to call her to get the Oder so they could rectify the issue, Treasure refused.  I do not recommend this store  at all, and Treasure needs a course in customer service. Worst store ever.</review>

I came in at about six to place an order and the lady there tells me they stop taking orders at five. Well then why are you open till seven? Anyways, she caved and agreed to make me a small order in fifteen minutes. I was told i would receive a blue cup and i ended with a red one, then she charged me two extra dollars for the order! It want even right since she said she wouldn't dip the pineapples but the strawberries instead. Unbelievable. I suppose its better than walking away with nothing but i certainly expected more from an overpriced fruit salad maker< /Review>

Customer service including the so called manager are horrible. My online order plus 300 orders were rejected on Mother's Day. And they all decided to leave work early cause one of the workers there decided to go home. Therefore everyone else's orders weren't completed.

They called me 30 minutes later and asked if it could be as early as 530 because they close at 6, not seven. So I asked if they could do 6 and they answered back with 5:45, I felt as if I was haggling for unwanted business, which sucked. I ended up having to cancel and wait for a refund to my card.

Omg!! You have got to come down and try the al pastor tacos 🌮 it’s the bomb and their sauces too are all dynamite..my hubby loves the pickled cucumbers and the fried onion cubes. I have also tried their beef tongue tacos but I have had better so don’t dig them.there is always a line but it moves quickly..for $1.25 per taco (whichever u want) it’s a steal!</review>

Tacos at this place - great. Got there near six, it wasn't packed at all. The service here is above par. Prices are reasonable I would say. They have a lot of great reviews for a reason.</Review>

Oh my goodness!!! Best tacos in Cali!!! They are cheap, lots of meat and there's cucumbers, grill onions, cilantro, Onions, 4 different salsas (amazing Salsas), and amazing drinking flavor waters. If your in the area stop by and try them..</text>

I was pretty impressed by Dave's Hot Chicken! I got Combo #3 which includes a tender, slider, and crinkle cut fries. The chicken definitely has some heat to it and is incredibly crispy and tasty. The meat is tender and juicy as well. The coleslaw wasn't the best, but the pickles definitely made it much better. The sauce was primarily thousand island sauce so left room for desire. If you compare this place to Howlin Ray's however, I definitely prefer Dave's!<//Text>

<review>AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING 10/10 DO RECOMMEND AND WILL DEFINITELY EAT AGAIN. The tortillas are hand made and created in front of you and the meat is refreshing juicy and just down right perfect. The staff are friendly and they have multiple ways to pay like Zella/Apple pay/ etc. Meaning it's beyond convenient for customers. Thank you so much for the great food and experience!</review>< Pics>

Al pastor tacos are pretty good, not the best ever but absolutely worth a stop when in the area and very reasonably priced<//review>

< Review>
We stumbled onto this gem via google maps after our visit to whole foods (we're visitors from Singapore) and we loved it! Tacos are $1.25 each, and there was a short but fast moving queue when they opened for business at 5pm. The intestines and stomachs tacos were my favourite if you're into them. I believe this the the same stall listed as Tacos Chidos on Google maps!</Review>

<review>This establishment never disappoints. Consistently good!
I recommend the shrimp tostada...they put lots of grilled plump shrimp in their entrees. I always suggest this to friends and it's always recieved well.<//review><user>113676876469788636823< /user><rate>4< /rate>< GmapID>

Living on the beach youre limited to the culinary street art.  These guys are positioned right in front of whole foods among Lincoln making it convenient. The El pastor is skillfully slipped I to a corn taco and topped with a pineapple chunk.  The brisket is my favorite and they've nailed the spiced garnishes<//Text>

This is a really quick stop. They've got some of the most authentic Mexican cuisine that I have had in a long time. Fair cheap and really nice people. This place has become a must for my family and their visitors.< /review>

Amazing little street taco stand. They have 9 different types of meat. The tacos are small so you can try several. Prices are very reasonable. There can be a long line but it moves quickly.

They also serve fruit juice and horchata.< /text>

I was determined to introduce my friend to street taco food and am so glad that we came across this place! The tacos al pastor and carne asada were delicious. The cheese quesadilla was my friend's favorite. It was tasty, with a perfect blend of melty and cheesey goodness!< /Review>

One of the best DMV offices I visited in California!
This DMV is super clean, organized, staff are extremely friendly and polite. My REAL ID processing was seamless. I'm impressed by the way things went on from my visit. Highly recommend this particular DMV over all other offices in the Bay Area. Kudos to all the people who work here!</Text>

I was prepared to have a terrible experience but I had a great one. If you don't have an appointment, it is best to get there about 7:15am and wait in line (you will probably be in the first 5-10 people) until they open. They do a good job of preparing before they open so your process is as smooth as possible. I was helped by a very nice and friendly clerk who helped me a ton. She was awesome!</Review>

<text>Always a fast and pleasant visit when you make an appointment. I seem to always get attended fast, in and out within 20 mins. Especially right now during the COVID-19 Crisis, they are very well equipped and prepared for themselves and for the public. Concord DMV is one of a Kind.</text>< Response>

I had to go in two trips (my own fault) because I was missing some papers. I worked with Joan (disabled access window #10) both visits. She did an excellent job explaining everything to me. She was kind and efficient. The only negative is that seniors and people with disabilities have to stand in line outside. I'm not asking for special treatment or to go ahead of anyone else, but benches or some other seating would help.<//review>

They do the best they can considering the pandemic. I waited like 2 hours, not bad these days at the DMV. I've waited longer in previous visits. Just be patient as always at the DMV.</Review>

There has to be a better way to get stuff done at DMV. 2 and a half hours I waited to be seen... it only sped up when it was almost closing time.</text>

The employees are not kind. I have been here twice and each time waited 3 hours. The 2nd time I visited to register my car I was sent home for not having all documents. It would have been great to know about this when I was checked in and given a ticket. Now I'll have to come back and wait again and interact with employees that do not want to be there or help.</Review>

<review>My License was set to expire and I needed to hand over Medical Records to file at the DMV. I arrived at 4 PM one day and they turned me around and said they were no longer accepting people for that day. The next day I arrived at 3PM and it was the same deal. If a place is supposed to have hours that extend until 5PM they should serve customers until then. Now after leaving work early twice I am going to have to a day off to get this paperwork turned in. Yes I know I can mail in paperwork but I've had it lost multiple times. This place sucks, go somewhere else.< /review></record>

<Review>Still open, inefficient as all other government units. You have to ask your question in a very detailed way, or you wouldn't get the answer that you wanted. Credit card payment will add a service fee, so you should pay with your debit cards.<//Review>< Name>

Got my number and waited in the truck watching my place in line move up on the website they texted me.

Once my number was called I was in and out. Entire process lasted almost exactly an hour and was very smooth.<//review><UserId.>103313033958315596098< /UserId.><user_name>Todt Clark</user_name><Pics>None<//Pics>< Date>

< Review>
HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! I waited in line for an 1hr & 40mins. (As expected) however when I was next in line I walked up and was told my place in line was not being held anymore. I showed them the PHYSICAL TICKET (THEY GAVE ME) & they said it didn't matter because of the computer saying I was not in line... The lady then laughed in my face when I asked if there was any other way. One nice guy who was trying to help me but they wouldn't let him! They then said if I wanted to be served again I had to get another ticket. So another (2hr) wait. The customer service is HORRIBLE 0 STARS!!< /Review>

All conversations are behind plexiglass, and everyone has a mask on. If you wait in line, you go out to your car and are notified be a simple text app. On the day of my visit, the representative was knowledgeable and handled my needs effectively.

The customer service here is average for the California DMV, which means it is absolutely terrible by any rational standard. Expect multiple-hour waits, extremely rude and unhelpful employees, and multiple visits to accomplish even the simplest of tasks. If you have anything more complicated, you might as well just forget it and move to Slovenia because that's probably where the DMV thinks your car is registered.<//text>

Anyone complaining doesn’t understand it’s the DMV...

While my apt was cancelled due to Covid at the Pittsburgh location cause Concord didn’t have any. No issues. Life goes on.

I had read it took about 1.5 hrs. I grand snacks, water, and made sure I had all my docs. I also made sure I did what ever I could do online. As to not waste my time, the tellers time, an the other people waiting in lines time.

I went 15 mins before 8am when they opened an there were about 25 people in line. Great service, organized, an easy.

Shout out to Vicki for great service and not making us feel rushed or unimportant.

I had a kid with me. I waited outside till they called my number.

About 2 hrs an I my real ID an paid my registration.

No complaints here<//Review>

1. Hours are not accurate on google. Not accurate on website. Rolling PG&E blackouts and energy conservation forced them to close earlier. Why is this info not posted online?
2. Documents to bring is NOT clear. Makes it very hard to renew license. In what day and age are we living in, that still requires printouts? Esp for just recent moved people. No I do not have pieces of mail that I moved into just days ago.
3. Just rude staff and very condescending. What else is new at the DMV.<//review>

<user>110681954588892454294< /user><review>Had to go twice this past week after moving back to California. Staff here were polite and acknowledged the wait, which seemed shorter than I expected. I appreciated their efforts to socially distance patrons and the availability of hand washing stations outside. One clerk went around making sure people waiting had their masks on appropriately too, which was great. About as pleased as I could be while getting tedious paperwork completed.</review><rate>5<//rate><user_name>Eugene Burbige</user_name>< date>

They’re doing walk ins for services that cannot be done online. I recommend coming when they open, got here at 10am and left at 11:40am. You have to wait outside so be aware if it’s a hot day.< /Text>

Stopped counting the line up once I counted 75... and then hour later staff came out to nicely let everyone know the computers were down. It is impossible to make an appointment online. I am only trying to get a state license but have been licensed for 34 years already in Canada. 2 days of trying in person and 1 week trying online with end result I still have my Ontario license 🙃<//text>

The staff was efficient and helpful.  Everyone is wearing masks and they do temp checks at the door. They even have an automated system that will text you your number and your place in line. I was in and out of the office in about an hour.< /review>

<text>Very disorganized. Customer service was poor as well and they lack clear communication. My partner made a driving test for 11:40 a.m we get there, read the signs and get in the correct line. We're standing there for a while around more then 10 minutes until a worker finally asks if we're here for a driving test. Mind you IN LINE where it states that. She sends her to window 17 while I wait outside. When she comes out she said they asked her to pull up and park to where it begins. She pulls up and a guy asks her if she's here for a driving test he then says they're going to lunch and aren't doing test til 1 p.m!!  And I felt like he was making her feel like we came late because he made a comment about "just now pulling up and your appointment is at 11:40 " well sir.. we have to follow dmv guidelines and rules, correct me if I'm wrong? So how is that supposed to work? but we were there on time and waited for a very long time. I asked him why did we make an appointment just to not respect our availability and unprofessionally he said I don't know you can figure that out in the front. The experience was a nightmare. The staff are inconsiderate of our work schedule because now we have to call out since they pushed it to our work time. So warning: your set appointment time won't matter. You're on their schedules.< /text>< user_name>

Horrible... no heart to waived late fee by management at this Concord DMV. I told the truth about not getting a renew registration in the mail. I forgot all about the registration till I realized on January 01, 2021 that my registration expired November 20th 2020 so I went in to the Concord DMV today the 4th because I didn’t get a renew notice. Due to COVID 19 DMV didn’t send me one? Or mail man lost it? Who knows? I had to pay $190 late penalty fee. It’s absolutely not fair. I asked for one time waiver and DMV clerk said it’s not a good reason.< /Review>

This place is horrible! It took me 3 months toA get an appointment and didn’t bother to send a notification that it’s canceled. No text, no email, not even a call.
The personnels outside is highly unprofessional and rude in top of that. They lack basic crucial information and avoid interaction to due to can’t provide a valid answer.
Employee needs basic training, current events, and so forth.<//text>

Applied for Real ID, got a Verification Code. Inadvertently paid for Fake ID DL. Told to wait for the Fake ID first, then go back and "convert." State of California screwed CITIZENS and LEGAL RESIDENTS by handing out FAKE IDs to illegal aliens. I've decided to USE MY US PASSPORT. Hopelessly incompetent CA DMV.< /Text>

DMV today.       I had to get my real ID.   I'd been here twice before earlier in the year either to be turned away (covid concerns) or I didn't have all the documentation.    They check you outside, your ticket is electronic ( they even text you when it's your turn ).    Only took me 4 hours (and it's sad that that's a positive).<//text>

Horrible customer service i went up to a window, do to the fact there is no customer service witch is usually in window 1,so I went on the circle on the floor witch said "stand here" and  "I said I have a quick question" she looked at me like I was crazy just to even ask....
She replied with a "NO" rolling her eyes and nodding her head!!! I was so surprised this had never happened especially in this one!!!! Her name Alicia by the way!!!!!!!!!! They didn't want to give me a last name!</Text>

We drove an hour to get to this DMV location and they just lied to us saying that they are calling those people with appointments and sending out emails and that I should get one on that day saying that our appointments are cancelled.

Very Rude staff. Poor customer service. All my day was wasted and nobody really helped me. They made me get appointment numbers every time because a staff didn’t know how to their job and was rude. The manager is super unhelpful and disrespectful. Very disappointed. If people don’t wanna work and are so lazy, I don’t know why they still there. They need a better management.</text>

Today it was not crowded
I didn't wait long; my number was called right away. Window 14 customer service representative was very professional and no problem encountered with the representative.    I gave a 3 because it was what I expect when I go to do business.with DMV.< /text>

<rate>5</rate><text>No appointment, and in the middle of lockdown... But the experience was the best I've ever had at DMV. Arrived at about 8 am, and they were already open, even though the website said they would open at 9. There were about 25 people, and the process was highly organized. Waited about 10 minutes to get a turn number, then another 10 minutes in the second line to get one of the 18 seats inside. Another 30 minutes or so to get to the counter; they text you at every step of the wait. About 10 minutes to submit the RealID paperwork (I uploaded everything in advance) and another 5 minutes for the photo line. The young lady clerk I worked with was the best; very kind and friendly, & chatting amiably while she worked. DMV in Concord was a very pleasant experience... Maybe I just had low expectations? Five stars!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Response>None< /Response><Text>I went there to find out about the status of my wife's driver license renewal which  we applied before the license expired but still have not received it. The DMV office in Walnut Creek was not any help and gave us a phone number to call , when we called nobody answered phone so we went to DMV in Concord and the First person who helped us was very polite and helpful due to some verification of ddress we had to go home getting the documents when we went back to concord DMV this time it was another employee and she was very unprofessional and rude and she did not want to help. This person with no customer service skills and helping the public ,she is not suitable to be in that position. We will return to DMV tomorrow.<//Text>< rate>

<text>Considering the pandemic and having to revamp their wait protocol, it wasn't bad. I wish they had bigger "Start Here" signs. Everyone went to wrong line because we could see "Previous Appt" and didn't realize we needed to go there first too.  If you can't do what you need online, don't worry.  It's not crazy at the DMV. You can start most processes online though.  I highly recommend it. It moved me up in line for the Real ID.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

THUMBS Up if this is helpful.  The staff is polite.  The wait time however is brutal. They have a new ticket number system that you can see in my photo.  It uses your initials and last 4 digits of your phone number.  The guard directing people did not let the disabled people know they could go to the appointment only line. In addition be aware that they now advertise on the screens that show the ticket numbers so you will now be sitting through commercials while you wait.< /Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Got to Concord DMV twenty minutes from opening. There was a short line and a very empty parking lot. After the pre check in line by the staff, where they see if you have all the paperwork required for what your processing, then they separate you into groups. One for appointments, one for driver's licenses and tests, and one for non appointments and registrations. Ten minutes before opening they start bringing in the group with appointments then within minutes they bring in the driver's licenses and tests. I was in the non appointments and registrations line and they started bringing us in, also before opening of 8:00 am. The staff starts bringing each person to a processing clerk until all windows are filled. I didn't even wait in a line inside and was immediately brought to a clerk window! 🙌🏼 🙌🏼 I was out of DMV within eight minutes! They are very organized here and the staff were friendly and courteous. Great job Concord DMV!! 🥇💯<//review>< pictures>

This is F-Tier awful service during the pandemic. Cannot get an appointment and blocking customers who are having issues.  Tried calling, and cannot reach an agent. Any high school student working at McDonald's can do better than this. Pathetic.</Text>

<review>Had a bad experience,  I was bounced from one person to another,  I spent my whole day back and forth to DMV because I was told to bring one thing and when I went back something another. So they need to give better training to all the workers that they know the requirements and able to direct customers one time rather than you take one requiremen and told to get something else, some of them are very rude, they dont care for your time,</review>< Pictures>

Came in for Drivers License renewal/Real ID. They had a "triage" station just inside to send you to the proper area. For each step they were watching the lines and changing staff duty stations to handle bottlenecks. All staff were courteous and knowledgeable, and if there was something they didn't know they had immediate access to other staff that could answer the question. Was in at 8:10 am and out at 8:50 am. Great experience.< /Text>

ONLY ACCEPTING APPOINTMENTS. It is not stated anywhere on their site. It is not listed on any boards outside the building. Do not come in without an appointment.

As of 7/16/20 Tuesday. Arrived at 6 30 a.m. People started to line up at around 7 am.
7 30 - staff were helping and checking to see if everyone had everything.
Staff here is super friendly!
Just please keep things to yourself. People were rude and complaining. Just follow what they tell you to do and make it quick they are being nice after all. Lady at #7 was super nice and helpful.
If you are renewing a license. Make sure you fill out the application online and get a confirmation number. If not you can do it inside the DMV.< /review>< Pics>

WORST SERVICE EVER
WAISTED OF TIME I WENT TO PAY MY REGISTRATION FEE THAT I WAS TOLD BY THEM WAS 24 DOLLARS. BUT WHEN I GET THERE WAITED FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND IN THE WINDOW MY REGISTRATION FEE WAS 151 DOLLARS AND I PAID FOR THE CAR 100 DOLLARS. NOT RECOMMEND IT!< /text>

By far the fastest DMV I've ever been to, staff have always been friendly and helpful in my experience. Yes it's a busy place, but the wait is very reasonable for the amount of people they are helping. Also, if you find like I have that the DMV website isn't always clear about what you need to do, the staff here is happy to hear out what it is you are trying to do and will explain clearly what paperwork to fill out and submit.</Text>< pics>

I had a great experience at DMV recently. I went to get my Real ID with no appointment. I was there at 8:45 am and was out by 9:10 am. This was on a Tuesday morning. I was impressed by the efficiency of the staff and the routine they had in place for this function.< /Review>

I hope they keep the COVID-19 policys in place even after the opening. The lady helping me guessed 20-30% of everyone that goes to the DMV could take care of there issue online, and that the wait times have been amazing since this whole Covid thing.

I agree 100% and hope some sort of policy is put in place that says if there is an online option for your issue, then you have to try that first. Iv needed to visit the office twice since covid started and both times I was in and out in less then 15 minutes. Both issues would have taken over 2 hours or more before.</Review>

<text>The office is well organized.It's far from the 80s & 90s days where one spends all day for any transaction.Though class B licenses are bit harder to process.Next visit would be my 3rd visit.I guess maybe because of these new stricter laws of this new Real ID.They require so many documents to process class A and B licenses.A real turn off for commercial holders.</text>< Response>

Wow! Apparently we are in a new era of the DMV. Went to Concord DMV with no appt to get my Real ID driver's license. Arrived at 7:30am Saturday morning for 8:00am opening and 20 people were already in line. At 7:45am employees starting organizing us (maybe 50 people by then) by what we were there for. I had my confirmation number from previously completed online application and the necessary documents. Jovial staff members sent me in, directed me, processed everything, took photo, and I was out by 8:02! At that time, there were people taking care of their business at all the clearly marked counters with polite, helpful staff members around to direct people and keep it all moving. There were about 10 new people in line outside being greeted. Employees were upbeat, efficient, and knew just what to do. Thanks, Concord DMV!<//Text>

Wow, this was the best DMV experience I have ever had. Was helped right away and given a number to be called. Didn't have an appointment but I was in and out in an hour. Checked in, real ID and ID renewal, picture, exam and bam! Out of there. All of the staff I came in contact with was really nice and helpful. Checking online to see what was needed and getting as much as I could done ahead of time was a big help. I'm definitely going to go there again in the future.</review>

Very efficient and friendly. I did not have an appointment to get my Real ID. I got there a few minutes before they opened, which is 8 am. I was finished by 8:15. Make sure you do application prior and have all your docs, it will make things quicker.<//review>

Are DMV is okay. Sometimes you're going and it won't be too busy around 1 a lot of times. That round picture was around around you got to keep your motorcycle inside those two lines it's not easy to go down with a big old Harley that's for sure. Otherwise I've never had any problems at this DMV I've done pretty good. I'm sure other people have. Everybody does it always helps if you make an appointment but those are pretty far out right now<//Text>

<text>I've literally never had to deal with more incompetent group of people in my entire life . How do mail my registration bill to my current address and then send the actual registration to old address . Then when I bring both in and ask what happens with both letters as proof they messed up I'm told it was my fault and I have to pay . Then when getting a driver's license they literally mail it to a completely different address that is no where near where I live .<//text><GmapID>0x808566c1682b30bb:0xabf8848c16a6ff80<//GmapID><Rate>1<//Rate>< Pics>

If you have an appointment, it will be real quick.
Today I had an appointment for behind the wheels at 11:40 and I was out by 12:05. I m so glad I had the old(but young at heart)  gentlemen( Maddy I suppose) as my instructor. He was really sweet and made me comfortable throughout the test. And the lady at desk 17 was very patient and welcoming. Overall, I had a good experince with concord DMV.< /review>

<review>Quickest non-appointment service I've ever experienced. I also have polite and helpful workers, every time. Actually makes my experience going to the DMV not seem so daunting. Needed to go twice in one week for separate and unexpected reasons; one employee even recognized me upon my return visit. Never thought I'd be giving the DMV a great review but I think this location deserves it.<//review>< pics>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Review>I was happy in approximately 7 minutes waiting time for non-appointment on Thursday afternoon in Concord. This DMV was clean. The employee behind the counter was helpful and kind. Except I was disappointed that I couldn’t be able to review my ID photo shot. A camera guy in Room 19 said “you take what you get, we can’t retake the photo again”. That is our photo we present the photo ID for many occasions. Come on DMV camera person! Be kind to people. The DMV in Daly City allows you to view your photo shot a couple of times until you are satisfied with it.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>The high rating is based on how poor Walnut Creek DMV is.  you will still have to wait but you will not treated poorly. Bring a video game or smart phone and figure you will at least be allowed to park it until you are called. use simple math you may have to pick up lunch but you will be able to take care of business.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Rating>4<//Rating>< name>

They are allowing people to come in with no appointments  but make sure you have filled out everything and have verified paperwork. Try to get as much as possible done through the website.< /Review>

<review>It may be slow service but there is a lot of people so what can you expect? But anyways, they have got awesome employees that are willing to help you. I ask though, could you add a website so that I could go to and look at your official online test to take after studying the booklet please? You guys are awesome and service even if its slow but hey, you don't hear me complaining :)</review>< Pictures>

SO much better than the Walnut Creek DMV. Any DMV visit is going to be a while, but Concord was faster, their space was cleaner and had a clearer layout, there was more parking (I've seen the Walnut Creek DMV run out of space before) and Tisha at the front desk was so friendly, helpful and efficient that I had to bring her up specifically!<//Review>

We had an appointment to change titles for both vehicles. The woman that handled appointments provided all paperwork we needed and highlighted which areas we had to fill out. It took about 10 minutes to fill out the forms and then she gave us a number. Our number was called in another 5 minutes and the next woman was very helpful and cheerful. We were in and out in about 35 minutes.<//text>

Here with my son taking his behind the wheel driving test. Had an appointment at 3:40pm.  It’s 5 PM now and I’m still waiting.  Found out they only have one person giving the test.  And she is very rude  First she asked me a question, I answered her and asked her why she asked me, she told me “it’s none of your business“ and walked away. I kept quiet, I didn’t want her to fail my son.<//review>

Being open till 1 on Saturday when it takes 3-4  weeks was GREAT .I thought. Until when arriving before noon I'm told that no one without an appt will be helped after the "cut-off" time and this is the LAST Saturday they'll be open because they haven't been busy enough. Highly annoying .< /review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I rarely leave comments but I have say Dolly and Tish at the Concord DMV were so patient.
There was an annoyed customer behind me, and even though I felt ‘the heat’ and frustration of my taking time at the window, Dolly told him to be patient, answering all my questions, and asking relevant questions. My brother died, and I get anxiety filling out paperwork. Both Dolly and Tish were efficient and empathetic.
I have been at the Concord office in the past, and it has always been a good experience.
Even though you bring in the right paperwork, the process sometimes is confusing.
Thank you, Dolly and Tish, for all your help!

<Review>They only have 3 or 4 employees in the morning and aren't fully staffed until 3pm. It's a freaking joke. You could show up at 730am and not leave until 1pm. If you show up at 430pm however, you will leave by 6pm. The online section is obsolete, even for a millenial like me. For fastest service, show up near closing because they can't leave until they serve everybody.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I had a complex problem and of course dreaded going to the DMV—the long lines, the risk I’d get someone rude helping me.  To my very pleasant surprise, Tisha (window 2, doing the triage for the long line) was SO pleasant, patient, and helpful.  She made me feel calm and like it would be ok—and it was.  Yes there was a long wait, not her fault.  The management should hire more people.  Still, way better than Walnut Creek where I live!  Lines even longer there and the staff is rude.< /text>

Arrived 30 minutes before opening and had all of my forms filled out and ready to go. Progressed through the line with patience (20-30 mins), got my number (1 min) and then was called after sitting in the waiting area for about 30 mins. My transaction was completed in about 5 minutes.

Terrible place. Slow, rude people.

However there was a female employee there I spoke to, she was very VERY nice, and tried her best to help although she seemed to be lacking knowledge. Only reason why for 2 stars.<//review>

I don't normally write reviews but I've never been in and out of the DMV in less than 45 mins (despite the estimated wait time of 1hr & 31mins listed on the dmv website). Trisha was very cheerful & personable too (despite the fact that she has to volunteer work on Saturdays now too) completely changing my outlook on how great customer and government services can coincide. They have made my day for once :-)<//text>

This DMV is the absolute worst; do not come here unless you have no other alternative.

Why the 1 star review? Well...

I wasted 3 hours of a day coming here for a routine DL renewal yesterday. Before I was finally able to leave the "system" went down, and I couldn't take the test (?) To renew my license. I had to make an appointment to come back the next day. Here now and the "system" is still down. In lines and the employees are clueless, nobody knows what's going on and the customers are directing traffic.
Update: they just handed someone taking the test the answer key LMFAO

Have I died? Is this purgatory? Are these paunchy beaureaucrats demons? If not I'll be a born again Christian tomorrow in case hell is anything like this<//Text>

Worst ever. Rude and not helpful at all. I have a cut on my head and thought I could use my old picture because I could use it if I paid online. I should have. Complicated. They wouldn't let me use my old picture and sent me away after 2 and half hours! Not cool, and really rude people.</Review>

Pittsburg was super busy, the line was around the building, I drove to Concord instead. Immediately, as soon as i came in i was approched by a lady (dmv staff) and asked me what i was here for. I told her, and she had me go to the correct line, instaed of having me  wait in line for a number. Afterwards, i was done filling an application on the computer. I stood up and walked away from it when another lady approched me and told me what to do next. Now i was waiting in line, no mre than 2 minutes i get called. I thank the lady at the computer (Trisha i think her name is) for being so helpful there, as the dmv can be so frustrating. To Concord supervisors and Managers please know you have an awesome TEAM!</review>

Just like any DMV it gets packed really quick if you don't come early and wait for a long line in non appointment.< /Text>

I love this place. The service is as fast as you’re gonna get at a dmv office for the amount of people you get here. I really like how a third of the customers don't understand english very well. And the tired faces and children screaming from boredom, just precious. Did anybody mention the children’s play area and free wifi? Or even the Pete’s coffee booth? Because there isn’t.
It’s the DMV, and they have to deal with all our bull crap stories and excuses, and lost paperwork, stupid facial expressions, and bad english. All in all, they dont do so bad. It might help, if more people go to the DMV office closer to their own cities. The one in Pittsburg is half as full. And so is the Walnut Creek office.
So please, dont write a review on a DMV office anywhere, and just get your crab together.<//Text>

Do not go here for driving tests. I booked my test 3 months in advanced. I was driving all morning no problem. The examiner was condesending from the start and did not pronuciate. He said to turn left pointed right i began to turn right put of confusion and he raised his voice at me. My test lasted less than two minutes becuase of this. Him claiming i didnt stop at a stop i did in fact stop at. He spoke to me like i was an idiot after that and implied i lied about my driving experience. Over all he was an idiot.</text>

Horrible slow slow slow service, if you come at 430pm they go super fast so they get off in time. This dragging their *** is unacceptable. People have lives outside of dmv and yet you can't drive with no license, registration  (which occurs annually), etc etc. Does the state want to make money or not? Been here 3hrs and they have only called 20 numbers with my letter. This needs to be fixed asap. People need to be fired and new respectable people put in their place. They are rude and disrespectful constantly to people. Not cool that I have to wait so long when I'll be at the window for literally 2 mins. Smh the public should boycott dmv and watch how fast they switch how they operate.</Text>

Its the dmv. We came with all correct paperwork, two forms of proof of residency (including voters registration card and irs documents.) Was told the voters registration card was not acceptable. But its listed as an acceptable form on the california government department of motor vehicles website. Please educate your employees on all current and new forms of proof of residency. Your lines may be long but your staff is not knowledgeable about current prodecures. Treated us as if we were criminals, didnt speak with us in complete sentences (this isnt.... im not sure.... let me....) complete nonsense. Please know we are patient, friendly people, waiting like everyone else. We caused no scene and asked questions. We were treated as if we were criminals. Looked down upon for asking questions and pointing out the inconsistencies from in person compared to their websites information. Update your staff. Worst time ever.< /text>

I actually showed up to one of my appointments (in Vallejo) and the line was obnoxiously long and hanging out the door.  At my 4th attempt with scheduling, I decided to go back to Concord.  Made it to my appointment 10 minutes early, got my ticket, sat down for 1.5 minutes, and was at a window getting my renewal processed. While I didn't have any other business, I would personally say my visit was awesome.

Worst DMV experience ever to register a vehicle to my name took 3hrs 49 min please do your self a favor schedule an appointment or avoid coming to this location unless you enjoy watching clerks sipping coffee talking among them and walking around in circles not doing nothing</Text>

< Review>
very bad experience .. they waste a lot of time .. a dark man who was in the window 12 .. if in the lapse of 2 hours I was there on December 29, 2017 he attended 5 ... it was too much ... all the time talking and in other cubicles .. should pay more attention supervisors in that people work just and attend to people .. it is too long waiting ... very bad .. !!!</Review>
