<Text>Great experience as always!
I echo my previous review, BUT I want to add....this morning 07/01/19, I had my dental cleaning and I was thrilled and elated to have as my hygienist a new lady that was thorough, gentle and possessed a customer care focused mindset.
She was the first black dental hygienist that I have ever had the pleasure to clean my teeth in my nearly 59 years of life.  I applaud Dr. Jupina for having the foresight and courage to add a black woman to her on-call staff. Thank you Dr. Jupina,  this doesn't go unnoticed or unappreciated!!!</Text>< pics>

I honestly can't see myself anywhere else for dental care. Everyone is super nice & no matter how long it's been they always remember who you are.

Dr Jupina is the best I've ever had this is why I stay with her. Her staff is great and welcoming also. The staff is always on point with what they do.<//Review>

Highly recommend Dr. Jupina and her team to anyone searching for great dental care and customer service.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Few weeks back simple filling on big
Tooth got failed due which tooth Pain become worse. I am taking ibuprofen everyday.Front Desk make an appointment and make my day off. Dr not even try to check the tooth and tell me directly to go to the specialist as she does not know what to do next. Did talk to the front desk regarding my appointment and my day off.
They were really very rude and using bad words.

My mistake was not making their video recording of their Bad Behavior.

Please don’t go for any issue If you love your life and respect.

Jupina Dental has done more than just clean my teeth. They have treated me like family. They have always been considerate of my work schedule allowing me to come in on Saturdays or in the late afternoon. They have accommodated payment plans so I can afford the dental work I need. I travel from Stockton because I know I will be taken care of like family.</Review>

They used 50 cents to let me pay 16.50 dollars for them. I double checked with them before I pay the thousands dollars treatment fees. They told me it will cover all but after 3months they send me another bill said I haven’t pay for that 50 cents. The 3months over time fee is 16 dollars!! No notices, no messages, nothing gives out between 3months. They have enough patience to wait for 50 cents become 16 dollars. Why you don’t change your job to usurious loan?!! You are really good at it.

If you think you are always happy, you could try this dentist. They are really good at to find a way to make you angry and annoy you!!!!

I don’t care that few dollars. I already paid thousands dollars fees. I just hate the dentist services.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

The portions are utterly massive here, very very good value. I try something new almost every time I go and am not disappointed. Their fried rice is so damn delicious that you're missing out by not paying the extra price for it when ordering an entree. Some of my favorites have been the chicken curry, the sesame beef, and the chicken lo mein. The pork dishes are also very good. I never leave unsatisfied. If you can visit during the lunch time, the lunch specials are an absurdly good value.< /review>

Not sure why all the bad reviews.  This place is really quite good. Food is always fresh and hot. Tried 3 different things 3 different times and all have been great. I would recommend giving it a shot< /review>

Great food and great service.  I order online and they have it ready for me with a smile.  We have stopped going anywhere else for our chinese takeout.

We always have an abundance of leftovers.  The portions look small but then you realize on the first bite how big it really is.< /text>

<review>Alright, we are all in Quarantine right now, but if you really want quality food and service, take a look at this small place. I have eaten in house twice and they have been wonderful!

So, on to delivery. Contactless, but I chased him down to make sure he got his tip. Anyhow, I laid it out on a plate as it was a lot, but, here are the Pot Stickers and Beef and Broccoli. As I requested, as not a menu option, they added heat to my dish. I said "Chef's Choice" and it was PERFECT!  The meal comes with steamed rice, but we all know what rice looks like. Fried rice is an option. Support these guys folks! Go local! They put out some great food and it is quality food and great portions. I give them five as they rock!< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0rTXy9VPEd3uSdYQZJvDIZVHxZWRQcXzEMc4d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIU4UH6nD-cf2FNjmdZpLX_djCipS3sMB-WR8W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2-5NPcbWESK2CQSVJbsZzDj5IM5L7T7FhOjYw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7C_Jnq-1ftOy8ffBiA8xhx87kdEqij3H8uc9p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOe4NlIwQIBrA6tbqv2Guf4We_2MrsuRjqZU-lo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgIwKxqP74Gg3O355BFxiSAn9fVdoDZXbEYvui=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN83Di3Dn5_13d2XmzrsAShblc7-gG2oIfQWZbA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< response>

They gave me the wrong order and when I called about it they said they would deliver me another one with the correct order. I waited over two hours for them to deliver me the correct order and they never showed up. When I called again about the order they told me that they never said they would bring another one and that they gave me the correct order. I ordered chicken and I got shrimp. After waiting for the two hours I simply asked for a refund and they refused to. Do not order from them they are absolutely ungrateful and do not care about their costumers and will just take your money.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I have ordered the same items a few times every month and I noticed smaller portions . They only gave me a small container of rice with 4 entrees ordered. Shrimp with lobster sauce only now has enough shrimp for one. The value is not as good as it used to be.</Text>

<review>I ordered the salt & peppered wings. It had great flavor & was crispy. I also ordered The Mongolian beef lunch special for $7. It came with an egg drop soup, noodles, fried rice & an egg roll. The Mongolian sauce on the beef was very tasty, a little sweet like how I like it. The beef was sliced thin & so tender. My daughter ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl. Which was ok. But she loved it.</review>< pictures>

Just ordered on line and it was delivered to my home. The food is the BEST I have had since I was a kid growing up in Chicago. I have not had fresh pan fried Egg Foo Young since living there until today. Portions are generous and prices are good. This food is even better than Peonies and Panda Express! Definitely a loyal customer now!< /Text>

The flavors of the food were good but the dishes were lacking. The lemon chicken was very thin sliced. So thin it was like a chicken chip with lemon dipping sauce. The Mongolian beef had very little beef and a thousand veggies. The soups were the best part of the meal. Skip the fortune cookies they tasted like cheap imitation versions. Overall it felt like they were cutting corners on the meal trying to save money. I'm not ready to give up on the restaurant just yet but I will look at others before I give them another shot . hopefully there other dishes are more impressive<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I tried SoChina for the very first time tonight and sadly I was very unhappy. The price was good but, the food was bad. The order of Crab Rangoon was small but, my husband said it was alright. The white rice container I ordered with my General Tso was not filled all the way. The General Tso had pineapple in it? I’ve never seen this before. I have typically been it with broccoli. The Lo mein and fried I ordered tasted off. I can’t place it and I did not like the smell. Unfortunately, I will not order from here again. I wish I could get a refund.<//review>

Not returning. I do not think the chicken is 100% and it taste like my food was cooked with recycled oil. Did not meet my standard of “good Chinese food” I’ll have to try a different restaurant next time. Thumbs down!<//text>

Rudest people I've ever had the displeasure of interacting with. They demand that you sit, dont know anything about the food, and charge outrageous prices for mediocre food. Skip this terrible place and go to panda. And the Thai tea sucks<//review>

I order out from here quite frequently, and it is some of the best comfort food around my area. If you are looking for authentic Chinese food, this is not for you. Although most of the dishes sound of traditional Chinese foods, don’t let that fool you, this is amazing comfort food.< /Text>

Ordered food for take out when this place first opened. Food was delicious and portions were very generous. Employees were a bit frazzled when I came in, but I believe that is because they just opened and it was super busy. Would definitely give this place another shot.< /Text>

<text>We felt like having Chinese food so I did a search what was nearby. We chose So China because of the Yelp reviews. Soooooo glad we did. Although the egg drop soup was very bland the orange chicken was amazing! Crispy just how I like it. The hubs got kung pao chicken and he said it was fantastic. He specifically said the veggies were done and had a crisp to them but they were not raw. We will definately go back. Large portions and daily lunch specials, and very reasonable.< /text>< rating>

< Review>
The appetizers served before the main course is quite bland by itself, however the sweet and sour sauce is tasty and unique. My entire meal was served to me directly and the drink I ordered, (coke), is well mixed and their smoothies, e.G. mango, strawberry, and taro, look delicious as well. The atmosphere is simple, relaxing and I have a strong feeling that when this place gets crowded, it will get hectic. I ordered the Orange chicken with the upgraded side of Chow Mein. The Chow Mein was well prepared and to go along with that the Orange Chicken was outstanding. The perfect amount of crisp tag-teaming with the perfect amount of sauce made it and outstanding dinner. The servings are larger than expected and would feed a happy couple easily. Everything is fresh made so it is hot when served and stays hot throughout the meal. I am not a fan of the plastic forks and paper cups but, I do agree with their idea on the no lid policy. The restaurant is absolutely Family Friendly. The staff is kind and serves your food to you with speed and efficiency. (Although it could change based on popularity). All in all it's cheaper than Panda Express, it tastes better than Panda Express. It has the variety of P.F. Chang's. It is an all around great place to eat. (Total was $13.10). I highly recommend to anyone who wants an upgrade to Panda Express at a cheaper price. This place is fantastic and I hope this review was resourceful.< /Review>

<review>Best Chinese around! Lunch portions are a great deal and dinner portions are huge! We have tried orange chicken, general chicken, beef and broccoli, kung pao chicken and shrimp, chow mein and all have been amazing! The egg rolls are also delicious. And you really can't beat their prices!< /review></record></dataset><record>

<text>The staff was rude. I've had an issue with the order today - I already paid for the online order but somehow the order didn't get through the system - so I talked to the manager about this. I wasn't angry at all, and was somewhat satisfied by how the manager handled the situation. BUT THEN this staff got really mad and started yelling at me just because I talked to her manager lol. She was just relaying what her manager told her, so I just wanted to clear things up by talking to the manager directly! Still don't understand why she was so angry just because of that. I've been going to this place quite often and liked the food, but now I need to think again if I want to.<//text>< pics>

I didn’t see an option online but may be I didn’t write it in comments but still can’t you do just toasting? Does that cost separate? I have not seen it in my past years getting sandwiches here before!!

<text>Fast, friendly service. The person who rang me up was unsure how to redeem my electronic coupon, but she asked her manager and was promptly shown what to do and it didn't hold anything up. This is exactly what should happen when a cashier at a restaurant or really anywhere encounters a coupon that they're unsure about.</text><rating>5</rating>< name>

< Review>
I have visited this subway for a couple of years and it has always been a very nice place to eat until today.  This used to be my regular go-to Subway but I will never eat there again after today.  All of their employees have always been top-notch but today my sandwich was made by a new male employee that was extremely rude and, much more importantly, he refused to change his plastic gloves before making my sandwich and I got food poisoning!   About 2 hours after eating this flung-together pile of bacteria,  I had a major case of diarrhea.

When he was making my sandwich I didn't realize that he hadn't changed gloves and I didn't say anything because I don't like to waste food....how's that for Karma.  I called the store to complain and the store manager said she would talk to the employee....thanks a lot.   How about giving him a dose of my bacteria that he can eat and we can call it even?    Eat at this Subway location at your own risk, you've been warned.</Review>

<text>Always been a a fun place to go for all ages, nice clean bathrooms, pool table, arcades for the kids, full bar for the adults, amazing restaurant to get your snacks or meals, lanes are well maintained, tons of balls, you can visually see them disinfect the shoes... nothing but good things to say.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>The music was good, but the machines and service sucked. During our game, the lane kept adding pins that weren't knocked down to player's scores. We played it out because we were only there to have fun, but I noticed the same error on other lanes as well. As I paid, I informed the person behind the counter, Frank, of the situation and told him that I probably wouldn't be back because of the apparent lack of interest in maintenance. He responded, "Good! We don't need you here. You can drive out of town and pay $15 bucks if you want to bowl." He continued to yell at me as I walked away.

I will not be back. Despite being the only bowling lane in town, the lack of functional machinery and rude service was definitely unacceptable.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80eab8058c7662a9:0x3c864223d4e3e859< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Terrible experience. They were busy, as usual. Asked for help with a product, was told there were 14 of the items that I needed in inventory. Was given a slip to go back to will call, waited for 45 minutes before anyone came up, they were helping other people. Meanwhile I saw two people standing in the back just talking when everybody else is running around trying to find products for the people standing at will call. When it finally came I turn I waited another half hour, literally waited 30 minutes for the person to come back and told me they didn’t have them, well  he had one, not fourteen like I was I told and waiting for. Meanwhile the line behind me was building and people were getting impatient. He said sorry for wasting my time, at least there’s that.< /Text>

They have good amount of stock. But when you go to will call they take too long<//review>

< Review>
I went to the location to day AM  to get some N95 masks for my son’s dental office.  I am told they are out of these masks, that they are on back order and don’t know when they will get them. My son goes in two hours later and is able to pick up 2 boxes.  I am scratching my head.....did the supply suddenly appear in those 2 hrs? The guy did not like my face?</Review>

This store needs to relocate to a better and bigger facility. Lack of parking. There is always a line of trucks waiting for hours because receiving is backed up due to space and efficiency.</review>

<Review>How do they stay in business? Pros: good selection and prices cons: slow counter service, bottleneck flow at cashier, will call at other end from cashier. Took us 25 min to pick up an order places on the phone ahead of time. Also orders delivered are often wrong and they have to return to replace.<//Review>< gmap_id>

I feel on top of my business and confident in the financials. For anyone that is looking to take care of their bookkeeping, I'd say there isn't a much better option that Regal Bookkeeping.</Text>

<text>If you are looking for a trustworthy, responsive, and quick company to get your taxes done, look no further! Ali and his team are incredible. I worked with him, who was so quick, responsive, and was able to take care of both my personal taxes and my business taxes. Last year I reached out to see if they could do my personal taxes and ended up doing turbo tax instead because I didn't want to pay for someone to do my taxes, but I will NEVER make that decision again. It was worth every penny having this team do my taxes this year instead. Highly, highly, highly recommend using this team to do your taxes!&#x1f64f;<//text>< pics>

They are good at what they do, good at accounting; but what they also do is reach into your pocket and take your money. I challenge you to get a quote that matches what they invoice, they also require you to be direct debit. Ali pushes, and has no answers as how long it'll take to do things. I would avoid this group at all costs, unless you're rich. Small businesses beware.</Text>

I was very worried about taxes. So I was looking for a tax CPA professional. But I do know about Real Group CPA. From Ali and his staff at Real Group CPA, I was happy and worry-free about the service. I will take service here from now on.<//Review>

Ali is very responsive and efficient. I just moved from Wisconsin to California so I needed to file Federal, Wi, and CA tax returns. Ali took care of everything from start to finish in a timely and transparent fashion, always promptly answering any questions (he often responds to emails within minutes). All I had to do was forward him copies of my W-2 and other tax forms, and he prepared all my tax returns quickly and correctly and was ready to file in a matter of days. The process was extremely easy and straightforward and I didn't have to worry about anything. He charges a very fair price, with no hidden fees or catches, and is an excellent communicator who is always available to answer any questions during the whole process. I highly recommend him.< /Review>

These guys are smart, fast and professional.  Will tell you what gets you more of a return and what will effect your return.  And best of all, they charge a very very reasonable price, much less than anyone else I've been to.  This is my new filing tax business.<//Text>

<Review>Wow, I could not believe how well this worked out. I had literally a BOX of receipts for my startup and we needed to file our C corp taxes. Mr. Ali had his staff organize everything, created neat reports and statements for year-end, and filed our taxes. Even helped with international documents. I could not believe how this group turned an impossible situation into something completely manageable. My spouse and I were literally dreading having to do this and these guys completely handled it on their own entirely hands-off. They may have asked 3 questions, and it was over email. I thought I was going to have to spend weeks doing this.

Ali is the ultimate tax professional. He takes a sincere interest in seeing you get the best tax outcome for you. Ali's rates are reasonable for the level of tax expertise he brings to the table.

Regal Group CPA were a pleasure to work with. Everyone I worked with from establishing a multi state tax strategy, filing taxes, or just general CPA accounting questions on what to do were extremely knowledgeable and patient when it came to my several follows up. What was most impressive was Ali’s response time! Regardless of time of day or year, Ali Emami personally immediately followed up via email, text, and/or phone himself. Most times within minutes already having the answer to my question, but at the least acknowledging my inquiry and providing a timeline of responding. I look forward to working with Regal Group CPA for all my accounting needs.< /Text>

<text>A few years ago,  the IRS sent me a Notice of Levy to garnish my wages. I entered into regal Group CPA office with a mess of paperwork and they took a strategic approach to deal with the IRS. Thanks to Ali, the crushing burden had been relieved.  regal Group CPA is the only tax professional I can trust from now on.

I walked in here expecting the usual sterile atmosphere of a CPA's office but was pleasantly surprised by how warm and accommodating Ali Emami was. He was very thorough with our appointment and on my way out I felt quite confident he would do everything in his power to get me the best return. The visit felt like I was catching up with an old friend. I totally recommend him to anyone and everyone.<//Review>

I found Regal Group CPA through Google . I recently bought a property and didn’t feel confident in the previous tax preparer I used, who worked for a tax franchise to prepare my 2015 taxes. Ali reviewed my 2014 tax return and found a few errors. We ended up amending the previous year return and I got a good size refund. He also did a great job on the 2015 taxes. I'd highly recommend using his service as he and his staff are very knowledgeable, easy going and convenient to work with.< /review>

Previous to working with Regal Group CPA, it seemed like all my accountants were difficult to get a hold of especially during tax season but Ali always seems to get back to me within a day. Even in his busiest times.  Ali prepares both my business and personal tax returns and he’s a very sharp guy.
His background and experience as a CPA is important to me because of the complexity of my business financial statements and the lending institutions I work with. The bankers and underwriters always seem to be pleased by my tax returns as well and have commented on how well prepared and complete they are. You will not be disappointed!!!</review>

<Text>New to San Diego and found Regal Group to file my tax returns this year. I had a great experience with them as the whole filing process went so smoothly and fast. They asked me lots of questions and reviewed all the details to ensure that I can receive all the deductions that I am entitled to. Everything could be submitted electronically and so is very convenient for any client. My wife and I will surely be using Regal Group again next year.</Text>< pics>

Ali is a tremendous asset for our company. During our initial consultation with him we were advised that the entity type we were doing business under wasn't taking advantage of several tax saving strategies. We followed their lead and advice and have saved tremendously since then. Also with their firm we're able to have our payroll, accounting and taxes completed by one company. Saving us time and energy. The whole staff seems to be very efficient and knowledgeable in everything that they do.<//Text>

If you’re looking for a good San Diego accountant, I highly recommend Ali and his team. He always makes himself available for questions and concerns we have. I’ve been using his company for accounting, payroll and tax services for the last three years for my business and personal returns. Very knowledgeable.</review>

Previously, I used to always prepare my own tax returns but after getting an inheritance from my uncle I decided to start using a CPA for my tax preparation this year. I’m very satisfied with the job Ali did for me. He’s a very nice, patient and knowledgeable CPA. I thought I would have to pay a lot of tax on the k-1 trust income I received, but it turned out to be a lot less than I thought with his help.</Text>

<text>This was my first time working with Ali  and I have to say that from the very beginning he was very kind, professional and prompt.  I came to him at the very last minute before taxes were due and he made a usually stressful time, very easy and carefree.  Regal Group CPA prices are very fair as well. I highly recommend Regal Group CPA and plan to have him as my CPA from here on out. Awesome job!!!< /text>< Pics>

Regal Group CPA provides payroll services for all three of our businesses and accounting for one of them. They do an excellent job and are very responsive to our needs, whether it’s providing financial statements, pay stubs or support during workers comp audits. We were trying to do our accounting and payroll with an in house accountant but after we consulted with Mr. Emami and his staff, we realized she was making mistakes and costing us more than just outsourcing the work to them in the first place. We’re now in the process of having them take over the accounting services on our two remaining businesses. I would highly recommend their whole team.<//Text>

Ali is a genius when it comes to taxes and helped me to actually understand my tax return situation after I left my last tax preparer in 2013. He also did some planning for me in 2015 and I ended up using a retirement account and other deductions to save on my taxes. I would highly recommend Ali for anyone looking for an excellent CPA in the San Diego area.<//Text>

This past year was our first experience using an accounting service for our taxes. Regal Group provided lots of guidance. We were very happy with their service.</Text>

<Text>I went to Regal Group CPA after having a bad experience with an online bookkeeping company I was using for my business. When I took their financials to my bank for an expansion loan I was turned down. The underwriters of the bank explained that the books were messy and didn't make sense.

From my first consultation with Ali Emami, my experience was excellent. Ali and his staff helped me to clean up my books and since then I got the loan and they've been a valued partner in my business. I've also had them prepare my personal and business returns and handle my payroll. Their whole team is professional and very knowledgable.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1583924772241, 'text': 'Thank you! we appreciate the reviewer’s and your nice feedback.\nIt’s our pleasure to do Business whit you.\nHave a good one!'}</Response><gmap_id>0x80dc072dc81a9531:0xf2c980dc8dd14137</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

If you are like me who has no idea how to make your taxes, then this is the place for you. I started a small cupcake business in San Diego, sales were growing and I felt like the right time to get professional consulting and tax preparation. Never had a problem with Regal Group.< /review>

Very good store. It's "small" but we can find almost everything what we need without any problem. And if you need something new - just ask owner(s) and you will get it very soon.
And very polite and friendly owners.
I and my wife, and as I know a lot of our friends from former USSR like this store.
Thank you owners for your hard work.</text>

The store has a lot of Russian specific food that other stores don't have. In addition this store has fruits and vegetables that other Russian stores don't have. The couple of owners is very nice, open and professional. I like to visit this store and recommend it for not only Russians.</review>

Prices are a bit lower than "European food & liquor", assortment is decent (you won't find variety of fresh cooked food like russian salads, but everything else is present).  They have hot/cold smoked fish, russian sausages, variety of frozen foods like pelmeni, russian cultets, potato cutlets (zrazy), and a big assortment of russian/ukranian chocolate candies. No hard liquor, but owner said he is getting license to sell beer/wine. What else... parking may be scarce because of some museum located nearby, but store got reserved parking spot recently so it wont be a big issue.</review>< Pictures>

Charming exterior and interior with tasty baked goods and drinks. I ordered a brioche with white chocolate and pistachios, which was good, but not $9 bite-sized good. The staff is friendly.</Review>

<Text>It’s only a once in a lifetime experience...Maison Nico is not a thing-it’s a thought, a dream, a whisk of wonderment, a dollop of delicate, a sprinkle of acute sensation, a fold of fantastic, and.....BUTTER! My sweet buttery Mother of all things sacred and delicious. These two are so modest in person-and engaging-and pleasant-totally devoid of the swag and swing I would have If I held the craft and artistry of the all things pasty and pastry!  Don’t wait until Saturday, make your way to M. Nico’s instead of Starbucks and live-live like love is in the little things. Make this your tucked in love-5 days a week. Start with 1-that’s all it took for me. And before I gain this 20lbs of butter on my money maker, I’m putting my money (happily) on Maison Nico!<//Text>< Date>

< Review>
Le Flan Patissier et le Tarte aux Marrons sont tres magnifique!

All right, that’s all the French I can muscle/butcher for the day.

Two takeaways:
1. Get the Flan and the Chestnut Tart
2. Two years of high school French does absolutely nothing for you

The Brioche Feuilletée is also good, but I personally prefer a lighter dough. If you enjoy meaty croissant doughs (think Tartine), you’ll probably like the Brioche Feuilletée here.

Bon appetit!<//Review>

<text>It is a nice dining room with an open kitchen right next to it.  The food were all decent but none of my 6-course meal was surprisingly good.  It was strange the two dessert dishes were very similar in look, taste and texture.  The service was decent except I waited for over 30 minutes for them to fill up my empty water glad but nobody noticed.  It is also fairly expensive.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIRmtAhSJAVHqidB-E_NHRnYml3PmFZ_FKOx4v=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPysj0QRFl51b4U9OewvcDH37xy1U4a-xa9oXhC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4wwExVuAMeZ1odWAZQgi_6I97xyCABLYkTUoM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKVVi5vlbASOiDUERBmIm71ro5TIcw5CpCDLEN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzpSzgrorYtMMrqGyj4R8m33cwpYlgVMb3Ibxq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>{'time': 1532559953990, 'text': "I'm so sorry to hear about the water not being refilled.

Love the assortments of freshly made pâté and aspics, etc. You can even see them making it in the back. We went twice in two weeks.<//Text>

The bakery is takeout only and you can also order ahead on their website. The interior is very very industrial with some touches of modern to it. Open kitchen where you can see the chefs at work, creating magic, I chatted with the owner while he helped me and he was so very friendly and humorous!

From their Ferry Building stand to their brick and mortar, the staff were all very friendly, knowledgeable about the products, and eager to help.

The famed feuilletée was very good as well, but the brioche bread center with the flaky outside layers wasn't an ideal balance for me. I would have preferred them separately.

The pear tart was my favorite - deliciously buttery,  with a thick and heavy crust, and wonderful sliced pear topping. A lot of times pear desserts are prepared with a little spice, like cinnamon, but I preferred Nico's simple version which was more demure but quite tasty.

I arrived to their brick and mortar 5 minutes before their 9 am opening time, and the lady there waved from inside and was kind enough to let me in to browse while she finished setting up the displays. She's so genuinely sweet and customer service oriented. I wish I got her name (she was the only person working the front at the time) so I could give her a shout-out!

Difficult parking at the Ferry Building. Easy parking at their brick and mortar on the weekends.

Overall, Maison Nico is nice addition to the SF food scene. Just in time for chonky bod winter weather!</Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Great upscale food with fruity flavors, surprised this place isn't much more busy than it is, likely because it's pretty new.  We ended up with a last-minute reservation, and it was better than a lot of places in the same price range.  We got the 6-course tasting menu (gave us a free 7th dish too!), which was a lot of food.  The tasting menu seemed better than the options they gave, though I might opt for the four-course option if I return.  You'll love this food if you like balanced, fruity flavors and won't like it if you don't like that fruity taste.  I loved it.  My only complaint would be there were some annoying fruit flies throughout the meal, which were attracted to the live plant centerpieces.  Why the plants weren't removed or replaced with fake ones is beyond me as the slightly-awkward wait staff was well aware of the issue and apologizing for it.  Still, the food is well worth a try and I'd also add the beer selection is excellent.</Review>< Pics>

<text>They have a stall at the Saturday farmers market at the ferry building, nabbed a few pastries. Parisian flan is the best, basically a creme brûlée custard baked in a crust. Skip the financier. The brioche feuilletee is nice, similar to a Kouign Amann.< /text>< Pictures>

So glad Nico reopened, if even simply as an epicerie, because it is delicious. Had a little bit of everything and it is exquisite (though my family and I discovered we're not fans of timut). The pear tart is absolutely divine. Thank you for excellent service and delicious food!<//review>

We had a spectacular meal in Nico's new Jackson Square location. The space is beautiful and intimate—an easy choice for a date night or relaxed meal with friends. We tried several drinks off the new cocktail menu and they were all exceptional. The star here is the food of course: delicious, ingredient-driven plates at a surprisingly reasonable price point. We loved everything we tried. Highly recommend this place.</review>

Had their 6 course set menu. My favorite was the duck breast with foie gras with spinach in a puff pastry and their wafer condensed milk crumble dessert. Cocktails was super yummy too. I had their Galette. Highly recommended if you you like pear flavored beverage. New location is also very cute. Decor was lovely. Q wonderful weekend night dining experience.< /Text>

Absolutely fantastic Michelin star restaurant in the Financial District.  The dining room is beautiful and intimate.  We had the grilled cheese with shiitake jam and Comte, the black cod with cavier, and the lamb.  Everything was beautifully presented and delicious.  They also had amazing cocktails and an impressive wine list.  The service was friendly and knowledgeable.  One of our favourite restaurants in San Francisco.< /Review>

This was my first visit and technically it's not Nico but instead "Nico Gap Year," with a different chef; presumably for a year. Had the set menu and it was everything you'd want from a fine dining experience in SF in 2020. A well timed succession of perfectly executed, super creative bites. The main was a meticulous take on a duck pasty that everyone liked. A standout for me was a crab and mandarin orange course I was craving from the menu. When it arrived, I was initially disappointed because it looked like maybe some crab-scented pannacotta or something. But hidden inside was an intense filling delivering all the crabby goodness with a pleasing tobiko pop. We added a truffle souffle I also recommend.< /text>

I enjoyed the chanterelles but the food was overpriced for a limited lunch menu, most of the salmon tartare was too salty. Service was okay.<//Review>

If I could rate this restaurant based on presentation alone it would receive 5 stars. However. I have two comments, hence two stars. One is the reaction I got from a waiter. He spoke very softly, to point at which I often did not clearly make out what he was saying. On one occasion I asked him to repeat himself, he did so using an aggressive and frustrated tone. My second comment is about the food. I suppose I should do some more research on modern french, for all I know the taste of salmon is intentionally drowned out by salt. It was not only the salmon though, it seemed every bite, from every dish had a recurring theme. Salty. Beautifully and artistically presented, the only thing that really stuck with me though was the sodium. I'm no connesoir, but I'm told my opinion is shared. Luckily I was accompanied by my sweet angel Kim, who could turn sloppy Joe's on a plastic tray into a fine dining experience.<//text>

<Text>The service here was top-notch. I never needed to ask for water or more bread or to take my coat and umbrella. The kitchen is in full view from any table, so you can observe the chefs as they make your meal. My wife and I had the 6-course prix fixe dinner. While it didn't wildly impress me, it did deliver a variety of great flavors and leave me satisfied. The standouts were the savory madeleines and the citrus sorbet.<//Text>< username>

<Review>Fabulous experience!

My wife took me here for my birthday.  In short, great meal with truly craft  cocktails.  I had the Madeleines with black truffle and the Monk fish for my main course.  Moreover, the service was fantastic, truly knowledgeable and engaged.  We also really enjoyed being able to watch the kitchen work.

Lastly, they were able to easily, and happily, accommodate my wife's vegan and gluten free diet and she too was very impressed with the overall experience.

We will definitely be returning.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>This was my first visit and was very pleased with the 4-course dinner, especially the snapper (3rd course). I wish that dish had a bigger portion because I could have finished two or three servings of that dish.  The presentation of the dishes was also very well done.</text></record>

<text>5 stars for what it is - expensive small plates, and they do it well. If you know what you’re getting into and are ok with that, I think you’ll enjoy it. I had the clams and the mussels, mussels were fantastic. Wouldn’t get the clams again, tasted like a mayonnaise overload.< /text>< pictures>

Very nice interiors, nice tables and set ups. Friendly service(see below) Great views
of the kitchen but it didn't quite make it for what we paid for a 6
course prix fixe and wine pairing.
We thought that the service was rushed--quick to serve and sometimes almost hovering to remove the plates and get on to the next course. Then there was the trainee waiter at the next table who came in the space between the tables and  whose back pockets were less than 16 inches from my face. I advised our waiter who said he would talk to the trainee-
it didn't happen until I said something. Also at this level of a restaurant the manager should have been alerted and intervened.
The yellow fin tuna-1st course was great. The oyster in broth was great--we soaked up the sauce with the great non house bread. The sea bass
also was stellar. The quail was good but the the two sweets were so so (see another review below).  The madeline at the end was nice but probably not made in house. The wines were all nice but in retrospect I
should have bought a pinot.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1533083444597, 'text': "I'm so sorry to hear your experience didn't exceed your expectations.

We loved this beautifully decorated spot in the financial district. The large fountain photo on the wall brought memories of being in Paris. Loved the open kitchen which worked efficiently and effortlessly in producing fantastic food. Although one of us was vegetarian, wonderful choices were available. Together, we especially liked: The Caviar, potato, watercress small dish (I could have had two or three of these with wine and be satiated for a day - heaven), the Asparagus bottarga with Meyer lemon was perfectly cooked, just the right texture, taste, and firmness. The Black Cod with artichoke and kalamata olives was full of delightful tastes, while the Morels sorrel, vin jaune was beautifully made. Brilliant flavors and tastes all around. The two of us ended up having three deserts (it was a birthday treat) - all three unique flavors - divine. Bringing this all together was the friendly, yet clearly trained, staff.<//review>

< Review>
What a complete deception! San Francisco has spoiled us with many good places to eat but I gotta say this restaurant was by the far one of the worst experience I’ve had.

Simply put there is no creativity in the food at all and you’re paying a lot for it.

We’ve had 4 course meal with a glass of wine (about $100 each). I hated all the food except the desert. And I have to say the waitress was really and professional.

Even the table next to us admired that they’ve never been to such a terrible restaurant in San Francisco.

I am taking the time to write a review because I hope it can help other people make a careful decision about how you can spend your money wiser when it comes to fine dining.<//Review>

<text>Outstanding wine list at very reasonable prices, delicious and subtle food, great service, attractive room.  Why did it take us so long to discover Nico?  The sommelier is a self-described protégé of Paul Einbund and it shows in the wine list - great Loire Chenin Blanca and Cabernet Franc, German Riesling, Beaujolais, etc.<//text><pics>None< /pics><user_id>118215429461024051452<//user_id><username>Christopher North< /username>< Gmap_id>

<Review>If I could I would have left no star but the waitress was very nice and professional and attentive to the details, I wish I could say the same about the food but I can’t, we had 4 courses and every time the next one was worse than the one before it, the ingredients simply didn’t fuse well together generating a horrid and unpleasant taste, it by far the worst food I ever tasted and I would rather have Ebola than going back to this restaurant.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>This visit was a 2nd vax. and to be fair, the center itself seemed otherwise quiet/closed.  Really, a great community resource and thoughtfully planned. There are beautiful moments throughout the campus, from the tranquility of the atrium garden to the alluring aroma of the flowers on the California Buckeye tress, definitely worth a visit when the various centers reopen.</Review>< Pictures>

Great place. Glad my town offers these services. Over the years Ive used the preschool, activity center, the theatre, and most of the grounds for various fairs. The place is really a gem. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Do wish the fair ticket prices were more reasonable but I'm not sure who determines that.< /Text>

I've been there for musical events. A very elegant place locally, to take in a show. Weekdays the parking lot that circles the center is great for walking. Twice around = 1 mile. Sure beats the canal walkways, which can be congested at times. Take in The Nutcracker during the holidays. Very family friendly.< /review>

Large building, multiple rooms, one very large gathering area which can be made smaller by sliding walls. Tables and chairs are available. A large bar area, kitchen and stage. Have your next event at RP Community Center<//text>

The worst experience in my entire life.  I went into the salon and asked for a pedicure and he told me he would charge 25 dollars and when I finished I got 45 for a horrible pedicure and it was very rude I will never return<//Text>

My nails came out good but the lady did mess up on my color I told her I wanted black she gave me navy blue she did rush me out the seat which I did not like talking about that some of us want to leave early and I didn't understand why she would take me if you wanted to leave early I felt like she just wanted to get quick money really fast she did a rush job didn't give me what I originally wanted so I had to change my design I say if you do go here do not go close to closing time best time to go is early when you have enough time to get your nails done so you don't get brushed I did not get the the lady's name but I do know her face and I will not be going to see her if I do choose to go back.</text>

< review>
Ive been to Allure a few times in my search for the right shop. I called in for an appointment this morning and was told to come in and they would be right with me. When i arrived several people arrived we were not acknowledged until about 10 min. Several people arrived after my sister and I asking for walk-in services. 3 people were taken before we were and we left to go to another shop in the area. This has happened one other time there for me....Issa NO!</review>

<review>Decided to get my nails done with my sister for the first time for both of us. Both of the ladies that did our nails did a horrible job. I understand it was busy day but rushing it just made it a terrible experience. Never going back again. Hope their customer service can get better and maybe take better care of their clients as well.</review>< Pictures>

Love the way they did my nails got a pedicure there they're wonderful or clean they're fantastic I just thought my toenails were dry and they told me that they were dry and I went to go put my toenails in my shoe and they weren't dry and they were all messed up but that's not their fault it's mine reason I left off one star was it seems like only one or two of the ladies actually understands English and actually listens</review>

< Review>
When my sister asked Vivian to change her color she  refused when she had only applied the color onto one of her nails. My sister had told her okay could you just take off all of the nails instead and she still refused and her words were “why dont you take them off yourself”. Vivian after that said okay I will take them off only if you pay me first. All she wanted was her color changed and she had a very bad attitude.
Do not recommend!<//Review>

Had a good a good experience when I got a pedicure but when I went to get my nails done Holly rushed doing my nails because she had someone waiting. Never going back my nails looked sooo ugly very disappointed ☹️< /review>

Went in today for the 1st time and my experience was pretty good. The lady who did my pedicure was very sweet and did a nice job. They do excellent work and will help you with anything. If they make a mistake they will fix it without you pointing it out.If you would like to have a good mani/pedi then this is a great place to come. They have about average prices with a great selection of colors, gel, shellac and vinyl.< /text>

We came to this place with great expectations only to be left with an awful castrophe of nails and toes. Don't waste your or money coming over. Honestly if I could rate this place ZERO stars I would!!! They were unprofessional and unwilling to listen to the customer to get it right. I'm a weekly nail girl and always tip my service industry folks well, but this place will never get another dime of my hard earned money. Upon walking in we weren't even greeted properly or offered a seat to look at the selections. Word to the wise don't think twice about coming here.< /review>

<text>The place was dirty. I asked the lady to do a design on my toe an she argued with me telling me she would NOT do what i wanted unless i did gel. But i have had what i wanted many times in past.  Will never go back. Waited 54 min on top of bad service< /text>< name>

These people.... smh where do I start. First of all I've waited for over an hour when they told me 30 minutes then I ask if they are able to do powder on my nails and they said no it was a guy. From there he told me to pick a color when I had a color in mind already , he then gets up and leaves and doesn't say anything and now I'm setting here waiting for someone to help me all over again. NEVER AGAIN , CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS HERE SMH<//review>

When it's time to put the polishs/gel on, it ALWAYS comes out HORRIBLE. The finished result comes out streaky, some Polish is on my skin and she gets it on the cuticle area, EVERYTIME! It looks sloopy and I always in up unsatisfied. When you go here, do not let the little old lady with the glassed polish your nails. EVER!<//review>< pictures>

< review>
I simply asked Vivian to change my nail color and Vivian refused, so I asked Vivian for my nails to be removed, Vivian then demanded I pay first then she can do what I asked for. I ended up leaving with my nails not even finished and on top of that I had to find a different nail salon, and pay for new nails.< /review>

This place is probably the best (and most convenient) hiking park in the south bay. Plenty of different hiking paths mostly flat some with moderate slope. There are a lot of shaded trails too.<//Text>

My favorite hiking spot! There are different trails of various difficulty level. One sees a lot of wild life here.
On weekends finding a parking spot can be difficult  7:30 am onwards. There is plenty of parking, though. Sometimes I go back and park on Cristo Rey drive and hike a mile (on a trail) to the Preserve which isn't a big deal.
Beautiful wild flowers in spring and, if the winters bless us with good rain, a pretty creek to throw pebbles in.< /review>

Great please for hiking with family to the farm which is approximately 1.2 miles each way. For the hard core hikers or runner, they can go up to PG&E trail and even up to black mountain. Parking is challenging on weekend.<//review>

This is one of my favorite hiking parks because it has some challenging parts paths and some simple paths. It's a great place to go for ease or a challenge. And most of the paths I have taken can be completed in 1.5 hour or less.<//Text>

One of the best areas to go hiking in the bay area. So many different trails to hike on and explore. Lots of trails with good shade too for hot days. Should try the pg&e trail, it’s one of the hardest ones there but really worth it for the views. There’s also a farm too, great place to take children. One downside is that parking can sometimes be impossible on busy days.<//Review>

This is THE place for getting a good exercise by hiking! The wildcat loop trail has a very good elevation and is absolutely gorgeous! I totally reccommend this trail! The vista point was beautiful too! This reserve has many one-way trails due to the pandemic and they are very comfortable to be explored 😌 If you have pooches that are adventurous, then this reserve is not for them since dogs are not allowed. But it is amazing for us, humans, to get a fresh start here! The weekends are very busy though, so I reccommend coming earlier in the morning to get a parking spot! It's great for kids too, especially since they can be engaged with picnic tables that are everywhere for quick snacks and also because of the wild turkeys, deer and the cute animals in the farm located in the reserve! I also recommend you to take lots of water and snacks to stay hydrated ☺️☺️</Text>

Very decent set of trails... Great views from some of the peaks. The one challenge sometimes is parking. Often difficult to get quick parking at certain times of the day during the weekend.... But that also shows how popular the location is...<//Review>

Views are not exhilarating but there are a few points to lookout for. Restrooms only near the parking lot as expected so plan accordingly. Trail is moderate and can be done by beginners as well.

I have hiked every trail. Do you doubt
my conviction? The proof is the
pictures. Depending on your comfort
level you can choose your own
adventure! Bring your water,
sunglasses, trail mix, a proper hiking
hat, shoes with good insoles and a
enthusiastic mind that desires to
wander and meander FREE. The most
preserve parking spots around.
Rancho will not let you down. Rejoice!
Starting out with Deer Hollow Farm
is great. What comes next is up 2 U.<//review>

<Text>Nature's Preserve trail so unique, wheelchair friendly, oxygen filled, refreshing, change of pace, away from hustle and bustle of the city, scenic, could spot some deers, octopus if you get lucky, breathtaking view if you reach the top, nice little hideout close to my place.< /Text>< name>

<Text>The staff has done a great job creating one way trails with easy to follow signage.    Hidden in the hills of Cupertino, this is worth the drive. Beautiful views, seasonal water and a farm!(not open due to Covid). Perfect for hiking, picnics or just to relax in the open meadow area.</Text><Date>1599848281285<//Date><name>Tristi Glover<//name>< resp>

This place paints a different picture, answers my different call and brings a certain comfort for me each time I need to get away from the chaos of urban living, stressful work weeks and noisy busy streets.

Though a popular spacious place and often filled with floods of people on the weekends, this space has a variety of offerings--lush greens, wandering animals, beautiful meadows, bubbling creeks, leisure paved paths and higher trails that lead to more quietude for those that crave for moments of peace and meditation.

If you're intentional about seeking out some solitude to clear your mind, listen to the sound of nature and spend a little time in contemplation while admiring God's creation right in your South Bay backyard, this place just may be a sweet gem you need without committing to a long drive--it's easily accessible and a quick ride from most of local neighborhoods.</Text>

My favorite place to go hiking. There are multiple trails to choose from with great views of the Bay Area. If you go early in the morning, you're more likely to catch deer grazing. There's also a lot of wild turkeys. When it's hot out, be careful of rattle snakes sunbathing in the middle of the trail. Due to the rainy season, there's been quite a spectacular bloom of wildflowers. There are nice restrooms in the two parking lots closest to the trails and a restroom by the farm. On a good weather weekend, you'll need to come early, otherwise, expect budgeting time to hunt/wait in line for a parking spot.< /Text>

Very easily accessible from South Bay and is hugely popular among locals. This is not a local city park, it's a natural preserve and stretches across the santa Cruz mountains and is gone to local flora and fauna, including the elusive mountain lions.

The park has many trails and thus doesn't bore you even if you are a regular. If your are training for a marathon, this is the ideal place as it has mostly shaded trails with fair amount of elevation gain. Kids are welcome and you will do many of them. Bikers are welcome too and is a great opportunity to get some mountain biking training done here.

There is also a petting farm located about a mile from the parking lot and is fin with kids. They have goats, sheep and cows.

Make sure to get early as the parking lot gets full very quickly. Or get in later when the earlier ones are leaving.<//text>< gmap_id>

Amazing place for short and long hikes there is a farm in between that is lovely to watch if you want to separate from the crowd go towards the farm and make a left in interact the left side is more shaded and after rain you will hear and see water flow next to you if you prefer open space go right or continue straight. Bikes are only allowed untill certain extent so plan accordingly.< /review>

<text>Large nature area with over 20 trail of various difficulties. Scenic with wild turkeys and deer. Great for family or seasoned solo hikers. Benches around for relaxing sits and some picnic tables for groups. Paved road for walking makes for easy treks for those of us with a bad ankle or knee. So close to home right off I280. Remember to bring water and enjoy nature.< /text>< response>

<text>One of the best places in the bay area for hiking, biking, or to go visit with farm animals. The trails are well marked, and most of the reserve is accessible for kids as well. The kids will love Deer Hollow Farm where they can get close to goats, sheep, pigs. All in all a beautiful way to disconnect from the Silicon Valley and always on internet... And get closer to nature.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORV13dOmP0pRlH1BRlT0uQXxWwjKB6coFXkJ_F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrf5CXR2VgOhoc0Xt1fOz4H31XSeeYr8wFpnIT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPfOWobFa_MNm8SvZXuZMcaCc_VqVIMV7nK4_N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSJ7GCxdpt-ckUKdPk0wqlR3DjSzL_MJ2xSNZE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHAVOnYdAeCwI-QHoKB_hu3EZWtP4OzvhfY2vB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQizFwZb_CbpvESC3JFSRxBaChRGxColE6HN8k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7fCMJbcmqTr7sdze3uTVAlxk76wNtrEuIL_fG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrdC9gP6qF8GhVYe6YHgo4wvi3tkDgQSYb7ZK_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMg-ZO7mAm1J33vdLOrWYc-sOa9Csn-Nkux0dkB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjMyxc7EFUbzMLR4duQ95eMZGT5ZIzQCCyD7q_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkY2J0O0MNcDyGvfJT6dIC_TLnZ9SF1xQm7KsZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqvS3VzMmod6LfD7p4zSNzKHyNGeFyJdKJamAf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9IbOVe9XOcLoXnwoiT7oLHtqPAWd251Pimqb_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMaSwBkiKvvs2D2ucdYDcPU9Rsnptfkj0UvqT9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNODgae5rAW6VuRxiv1dUn6DGS6-OGQwMdD1yMX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWu3KyvCGyVtq_U4mwo5V53T98N46-aX7BzuHx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4FrKkTE9jSf_gRpDE6E2qM9-qBUiScCDGug16=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXnzkHdPOsZcb4EcrRnd7gv65NFcIZuhxpEPYg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObg4sh3Fdi6vDTlty4IoCAzoYrcT_rryWlOjvn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPEdcgORWYC4h1aBAOxkuiBG-2HIXyTE1Z9HPg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvdUMufqkjCCIbpY0xgCYVA8H-bcR9UIWnRmmh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIXpog90DKkk4EToTPZgTczGyaakK8oY8xXH3d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipME7HsfH_Ly9p7GSf_qagCBJdX-_irwbeFFFfLf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlVSQH-fSm5cUZGlYl-z_TseLlezYGdGNIwdVG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzJcRx9MUsmKGEDI0oDA0GBX09kRPJSt-uVGhO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVW6JpKeRPRSQSP6hvZevsXDHfcsbuOHPNhT3e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMogQL79UzXNgt8OX0S6nTHoIHdF5OOH1JYBEAk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcEWmIOgjkJIHDhUPyF4W6ckq4bS1SnWeXmNv2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6YQs0E8IA6rAQVOjQDYO3dqVf6UStn-r6b3l0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMyJ_gnWrkhwLysqwM2fTM_xQEoYINLcvlbS04K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Excellent ranch, very recommended for family workout with kids. Clean and well made trail for both pedestrians and bikes at all levels. What’s amazing is the delicate farm full of cows, sheep/goats, ducks and hens/roosters! We also saw wild deers and turkey close to the trails! Kids love it so much! Thanks to park/farm management and volunteers who preserve this place to be like a hiking paradise for the community! Will definitely visit more often in future!</Review><Gmap_id>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I was visiting from out of town when my manager told me that we’d go for a hike during our lunch break. Despite the rain, the hike was absolutely amazing! Beautiful views and mist drifting up the mountainside made it feel like some movie set. Plenty of wildlife: deer, turkey, quail as well as signs warning of mountain lions 😅🦁<//Text>

<Time>1561297257549<//Time><text>A very expansive hiking area with miles of incredible trails. You can choose to stay in the flats along the hillside or ascend up the hillside to experience the great Bay Area views. One of my favorite hiking areas in the Bay Area due to the variety and magnitude of trails and size of the preserve. The canyon trail and hike up to the vista point would be my favorite two in the preserve. Well worth a visit if you love to hike.< /text><gmap_id>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e< /gmap_id>< user_name>

My first time visit impressed me. Fairy large area great for hiking and running. Different routes with ease or difficulty. Imagine spring time would be very green and flowery.< /Review>

Something for everyone here.  Need a easy walk with a stroller? Yes.  Need a long climb for your Grand Canyon prep? That too.  Just want to hang out with the kids and chicks (young goats and chickens...) at the farm? Sure.

The parking is lots better since the second lot was remodeled.  If you're thinking of biking, there's a totally different route (not hilly or car-y) for you through the neighborhood in the other side of 280, it's very convenient.</Text>

<text>It’s a hiking trail for all ages. It has almost all kinds of trails. Greenery all around. Shades all around👌 very soothing and relaxing for eyes. They have farm to show some animals to kids. Parents take their kids there to show them cow, pig , goat, lamb, many produces like few green vegetables.

You can bring your own food and have a potluck there. I see many teams or groups go there for hiking and after that they have breakfast/lunch/evening snacks etc.

Many fitness freak people also go to this place for their running, elliptical exercises and get a feeling of nature’s lap.

During your hike you can see many deers, peacocks and many many birds chirping. Overall it gives you an amazing feeling.

I personally like this place very much and o often visit this place to do my weekend workout. I feel hiking gives you enough heart pump to get you feel that you are alive.

I strongly recommend everyone to go for walk/little hike/steep hike/ fitness minded friend get together etc. it’s a place for everyone ☺️.

Please check my clicks around this place and you will see what I am I talking.< /text><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

Amazing place to hangout with friends or family. You can do picnic, hiking, walking and cicling.

P.s. 4 stars because this place doesn't allow dogs :/<//review>

Awesome workout place for different levels of fitness and training--from an almost flat 2 mile round trip to the Deer Hollow farm, to a moderate (550+ ft climb) 3 mile closed loop hike/run along Coyote trail (my favorite), to a difficult (1600+ ft climb) 9 mile closed loop hike/run along the PG&E trail.

There is a lot of parking, but this place is extremely crowded during weekends and holidays. Be prepared to wait up to 15-45 min to get parking during busy time. Definitely advise car-pooling if coming here with friends and family. Consider the 'waiting for parking' as a meditation exercise before your workout!😃

Now the best part! This place has awesome trails (especially when various streams have water running), lots of wildlife (birds, snakes, wild turkeys, deers, rabbits, and occasionally mountain lions), and multiple restrooms. The CA park rangers here are always vigilant, and helpful when needed.

The Deer hollow farm is a nice stop for small children if your are here for a casual visit. Updating (3/7/2020) with pictures from the farm (1-2 day old baby goats, and wild tom turkeys performing mating dance).

Update: May 03, 2020. Today we spotted a great blue heron in the preserve. It has been several years since we last spotted them here.< /review>

<Review>One of the best to go go hiking, if you one a long long trail this is the place to go. They have parking for the cars and then you can go hiking, but remember go with water, because is hard to find a place to buy it there. Beautiful mountain.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Awesome trails for all types of runners, hikers. Steep hills for gruesome LT workout, downhill well paved trails for constant low impact form work.
Been there twice for trail running/ hiking, no complaints, restrooms are quite well maintained too.
It gets dark in some areas of the trails due to trees so make sure you check sunset time before starting your hike/ run.
Climbed 1600, still so much more to go.

Starting at PG&E is better in my opinion as there are more gravel sections which are easier for uphill. Coming down on Coyote is better due to more smooth downhill and no gravel.

Lookout for small tree roots sticking out in the trails, they can be deceivingly high, I tripped on one coming downhill, not a pleasant experience.</Text>

<review>This is an overall great place for outdoor activities...
Great hiking trails, picnic areas, lots of parking options, well kept, dedicated area for RC plane flying, lots of wildlife, and a farm with a diverse range of animals for people to interact with as a bonus.
I highly recommend!< /review><resp>None< /resp>< userid>

Animal farm is a mile away from parking lot and everyone loves to witness it. Close to nature just 5-10 miles away from Sunnyvale or Cupertino.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPk_AtBNor9RS4KeYA-V5F8VjY3KLdsW-DoThhD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNe_M9XfCG7oxB4gN5HVQhnjFrl6P451pZMO2mh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhB6rKGj9s1GWbU4-AlKoy2vzlUX3SG3nZSE-M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_kr2UKMaOCLZmIn5YjTv_cQk9_bpQCj9Z0zW1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3eJLfRE0EMVW93-IdZHwW3JVqUOI6sFaP1t7c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8PkNcYiOJG-z7xnbu9PdRVzMTQJgqZu1Yi67l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZIrncv_QYOUxVAq4PZ07TDw1sXFOaAxDjSr-K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8U9LNNm5uTAElqlyjLeYI3OnBYdM8a47CWqqk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPsCgz7Ku23ySbhuC9g3Kq0ge5T6VuLtRKQqTdh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOt2584EflGrzI3KP9QVwezaRvWRweQWmEBWTKi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQPIobURyGWKknIphiYZtu3wJ9KawrGUe70eGi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOme5KbvMYvSlOdUpvtWrkhxzToPXtjymrVzPS2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONwG4Qjc4IdDyl73Fh4IWgGS_CUv2S_-WPI_p9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMssm38R8di1zaOo_Ohcr1Rp1PH-BxqdLMIEl5c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtFiRo7JYc7SQSnl4f77UaY-UzsrfxlPVz2w0e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbY5KR5S0FnyCi1WKvOfOoCiDHqPs55stLImYD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFb0jYjMhD-19KpTMCGOhDQjO2j1Mm34-TwPqM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_0YS3PyPPPJ3kerajo4sd2Pm91Wg2x-BZVneD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1J7xqtw930Rw1rXJkmUt0PLLkR3CyQ_szJQO8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrL9gcM1_UEFeENzQLRhoj63CoNpc8vFEthkf7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMlzsK6-cfB7QsLgZeaiOB5VrAeh6OVV0gjU4O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLU5ODJVYz7RF3scuwe36JKx7wxMQLXh1dcMHb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLBoO1IkABJVwE1vsAbTi9PIoF8aPu0H5f3A0O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOfEayyEdMSw0G46OevVB05VcZ-Xe55WHlP2ab=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgk1Ew1Iqo_MNosDtd--JPa8gg6XRQPsMidbBx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSJ_18e0lI3vS1tzBfT7tY2sXvhNcE6igODP0R=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

Beautiful views and fairly well maintained trails make this a great place for hiking or biking. There's a modestly sized flying field for radio control airplanes and the like. Parking is plentiful, though it got a bit crowded later in the afternoon. Social distancing was not difficult and mask discipline was fairly good if not perfect. Narrower trails have been marked one way to promote distancing, so it's a good idea to consult the map posted at the trail head.<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>There are many good short hikes here, and at some view points you can see a view of the south bay and peninsula.  You can also do longer hikes up black mountain, to Rhus ridge or Hidden Villa.  There is a good mix of trails with varied terrain.  Scenery are green after rain, but otherwise some parts are quite yellow in the summer and fall.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtNlUBC6EpmRFBnKIpuwMDmcNVZidue44Jvej-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_cZAYSdYP11qY04ZEe0Mq4B8usefUL4nZANan=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOa-PXoxkM12nIZHN2PamttM-JJICBBO9DvehsU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjmECvQ5uVm25GnAJzi92Tb9ARnq48W5DE4nDo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e</gmap_id></record>

<text>Beautiful area. Lots of wildlife to see. Must visit at least once. Lots of nice hikes for all difficulty levels. Some hikes are also stroller friendly.

Make sure to bring sufficient water/ electrolytes.

Always watch your step in the hikes. I have seen people fall and get injured.</text><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

Lovely easy nature paths with a sweet creek next to the walking.  Well maintained and my favorite,  the petting zoo after a reasonable over one mile walk. Animals are well cared for,  a very kind docent that was very happy to explain that area and the history. WHAT MYSTIFIED me were the 3 dead wild turkeys we encountered driving away from the place, in the open field across the street from the park. There's bike paths with various levels of difficulty as well as other paths for walking.<//Text>

I went on a Tuesday morning between 7am and 10am. It wasn’t too busy, just enough people to feel safe hiking on my own. The view from Vista Point is worthwhile and a relatively short hike from the farm and entrance.  Saw tons of wildlife and enjoyed the canyon trails and high meadows. Would suggest wearing layers as the temperature change can be quite drastic from trail to trail.< /review>

<Review>We picked an easy trail.  Round trip was only 2.5 miles.  This was our first family hike since...forever.  at the end of our hike to Deer Hollow Farm, there was a nice little educational shack that kids can learn fun facts about the animals around the area.< /Review>< Pics>

It consists of lot of trails with dense trees. If you are planning to take a longer one (black mountain trail) carry sufficient water as there is no water source anywhere. It is a good hike.< /Text>

A beautiful park with trails for both hiking and biking. There's also a small farm with farm animals and historical equipment and buildings. Great for kids, animal and nature lovers alike!</Text>

SO many trails from level to steep going up into the coastal range here. Watch for wild animals because there have been several Mountain Lion sightings here. Many deer and turkeys roaming the area.<//Text>

Did the wild cat loop early morning. Parking is a big problem. Come early as possible because one literally has to wait 20mins or more to see if someone is coming back. I reached at 7:05 and it was all packed with 4 cars ahead of me waiting. Trail is nice and moderate level.< /text>

Best place to hike. Has all levels of hike. Mobile Network coverage is good through out. Difficult to find parking. Restroom available at the trial head. There is a small farm for kids to see farm animals. Also, has a launch area for remote controlled air planes.</Review>

Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic trails are now just one way so you are forced to walk more.
For me that's great but for others who aren't in great shape it might be difficult.< /review>< date>

Enjoyed the hike. Very nice place to start the day. Could spot many deer along the trails. There are multiple trails for hiking. Ample of parking available at the entry. Park opens at 6 in morning (after sunrise) and usually remains crowded on weekends.  One can reach there in 15-20 minutes from Mountain View in early morning. Must visit place if you're travelling to silicon valley for business.< /review>

<Review>Deer Hollow farm loop trail is an easy trail, where the trail paths are well constructed roads. you can take your children along ,and they can ride their scooters as well.
There is a nice ranch created at the end of the trail. The ranch has sheeps ,goats ,baby lambs, turkeys,cows and pigs.
There is a small museum near the Deer Hollow farms , the museum has display of stuffed and preserved animals including red fox, owls, eagles , mountain lions and many more. You will also enjoy the touch table with bones, feathers, leaves,  seeds , fur ,nests and more< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbokeQ7s0qec7ZZBusaesti7Y0M9nGfZ1ZcEd7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpTzkN791PT--ss5rYzQTV5XOv1A2wyAPCYMIv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMAiVJv5hlCzA4Vfck8vpqZ82IEPi2VKVAa4ar=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRxoot0E1g91o-ZWUbWsFhfm83y5YmGELGrLVY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMboJIVMqduSMrRAFns7i48lu64sgWPoNkSVPtV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtZxWjZabNN_RgnuXbloQ7y2auDt4FVgFbazCP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e< /GmapID></record>

Love this park. Great trail runnning there. Get there early on the weekends! Gets packed very quickly. Also, try the Coyote Creek trail as an alternative to the more popular PG&E trail. Here's a photo I took from top of PG&E trail.<//text>

<review>Open free to the public 365 days a year. Open 30 mins before sunrise to 30 mins after sunset.

No dogs allowed.
Helmets required for bikes/scooters/etc (even for adults).
No drones allowed. Fix winged RC aircraft allowed at the runway. (Located near the main entrance).

Parking is competitive on the weekends, easier on week days.

Some beautiful trails, the deeper you go in the less people you encounter.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUN76_NVaVPhqL5Aknu-R12wjc_jY17KfFCITb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYow0mIdQ_h156CB7zkhbOERQbz66bNdHMLULr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPl-DPxAcE8ARAL1RI5L5TzjWIbeCxI807gUf4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0CgOxSKZ1ShytosJAzMEyqBs_XlJgJnHirGCH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwUd-MtD76_Qcqy83-hzkQ07IivA7DTqGesU32=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtnoUefSgp9sw0H1o2wDKCuHFm7HL5jpsEtnog=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcpdv19qTzg6HNfHkuIDFeGfJKsr57NjHMhY9S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMq2sFbR2uH6OwkMraVprocDSg5ZWGxBR-N0SRG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGDfKHHbGf1ugQvYg5qsFq-CzwZdMkqPeRiXdn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgtUGtTNmYJIdAamnTdemZC-2Df2k3t7P_uQPq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORhVmfP3BUHqKgMIpVQ23rJDLXz2Bi5wpnK233=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOm0_TjZdci4pqjniCIdrWJoEZZI_KIW7DdWVyt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3m8ljpWIBb5K6EMWYlQsl9RlLK05c4l24sa9U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

This is my favorite place for hiking especially in feb-apr. The creek is flowing and I love it.
There are couple of trails. Also there is a farm which is an attraction for little kids. Usually takes about 1:30 -2 hrs for wild cat loop hike. There are longer hikes available too.
Parking is not exactly limited but it is favorite spot so its hard to find parking no matter what time of day you go.< /text>

Good place to visit for trail lovers, be careful while bringing your children as during summer time you can see snakes near the grass/bushy places. Also there are warning of mountain lion. As we trail we have seen deers and also some creepy sounds inside the forest. Really must try place. But please bring water to keep yourself hydrated.< /text>

Trails were nice and big.  Beautiful views once you get to the top.  Not too challenging.  Get to your car before they close or you will get a ticket.<//text>

<Text>This is a great place to hike, bike or run trails. There are trails for every level. Plenty of parking spots with three parking lots. Water fountains are at the Equestrian Parking Lot and the main parking lot at the bottom of the entrance road. It opens earliest in the Summer at 5:30 am depending on the month. It closes at Sunset. My favorite trails are Coyote Trail, Upper Wildcat Loop, Black Mountain Trail, High Meadow Trail and Stephen Arbors Trail which most locals know as PG & E Trail.</Text>< user_id>

This is the most beautiful hiking place. I have been there almost every weekend for the past 18 years. I saw deers, turkeys, coyotes, snakes, but not mountain lions yet. You can adjust your paces according to your own strengths. Slots of trails for you to pick.</text>

This reserve is amazing, it has various trails with different difficulty level. We did upper meadow trail via wild canyon trail, its shaded for most of the route, offers amazing forest views along the way.<//Review>

This is a go to hiking place if you live in Cupertino, Saratoga and near by areas. There are plenty of trails here. Place is generally busy. Even though there are lot of parking, it can be hard to find parking in the mornings, since it  is a extremely popular hiking spot. PG&E trail is one of the popular trails. You can bring children to show farm animals, there is a picnic area near the farm as well. Great place to visit if you are a hiking enthusiast.<//text>

<review>Nice park that's easy to get to and typically has plenty of parking. There are a few different routes you can take, but your choices are limited. The trails are mostly exposed. There's western poison oak in every conceivable spot off of the trail, so don't do any bushwhacking here.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1ySpbyaU4nHi_kdqfvePZbYdeYX2z91U0JKFv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlXAz5rMo-9pmTs62dHBzhCj1UlcCB2QIcAQec=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMR-9iSiQvXAWCeD-4t42AvARxgWrhzdeNvpm9p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7ML0m6f_BxJraTiOQVYMrnHmKAFlyom1vGVeD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6w2E7ThjVZIGs2fuEgW0eAoW1g2Zhgf48lLbN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHfx6WR_sqZVLiNggQMGqNoJ0sGyt1-WF7oZ-h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Deer hollow farm is a popular destination for families with young kids. You can walk or bike there (separate paths). On weekends parking is difficult due to the popularity.< /Review>

Great place to connect with nature and farm life. Park close to the 280 bridge, and walk in to a system of small stroller friendly hikes leading to a farm with goats, chicken and other animals - that kids would love. There is a small picnic area too (restrooms are smelly).
If you want a more strenuous hike, there are trails that lead all the way up the mountain (or around it) and provides some good views from the top.<//text>

Parking was always a problem. During May shelter in place, parking is STILL a problem. Other than that, always a relaxing place to walk around.< /Text>

<Review>Ranch I San Antonio is a mixed bag overall. There are many great trails to hike, but parking is a nightmare over.

They have done a great job of trying to make many trails one way, but many people violated this. The one way trails also made it difficult to plan a hike as we didn’t know which ones were one way before we came upon them. This not anyone’s fault, but something to know.

It is pretty here and we did see some deer as well l, which is always great, but we likely will hike elsewhere until after the pandemic.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>Very good place in a good weather, during covid they made one-direction trails to reduce number of close contacts, which is good as well. Trails are short and long, for any levels, good environment for kids. The rancho itself is closed for now unfortunately.
In a rainy weather it cood be dirty, so check forecast.< /review>< Pics>

Very popular park - parking lot will get full as early as 6:30am. Come early and be prepared to wait.

Cars usually queue to get a parking, please be considerate and get in the line. Also, parking is first come first serve. You cannot stand on a spot to hold a place for your family. That’s not how it works here.

Always a fun time in this park. Lovely sceneries and great trails to really exercise and enjoy nature.

When we pulled in the parking lot was mostly empty so it appeared to be safe to hike. People on the trail were wearing masks and keeping social distance. The farm is closed for safety. Bathrooms are open for hand washing, etc. The start of the trail has a lot of sun so bring a hat/sunscreen.</Text>

I love the trails BUT hate parking here. People will just wait at an enterence until a spot opens up and cause everything to back up. I wish they have better security circling around to make people move or have signs that say no waiting/stopping. I would just park on the streets and walk all the way to the trail. It's far but at least you don't have to deal with that.<//review>

<Review>This is one of favour parks in the Bay area.  There are lots of hiking trails for all levels.  I have been hiking on the PG&E trail for the last 15 years and never got tired of it.  There are lots shades, ups and downs.  Almost every turn is a new scenary.  I just love it.</Review>< Rate>

Great beginner friendly trails, nice location. You can also visit the Deer Hollow Farm and don't miss the small cabin there, it houses several taxidermied animals, animal skeletons and other artifacts.<//review>

Beautiful and big park... Only downside is that it can be hard to find parking when it's really busy.  But once you're in the park, it's lovely.  The farm is a big hit with our kids.< /text>

Be prepared for a crowd on the weekends, but if you're an early riser and want to run some trails the views can't be beat so close to civilization. The Chamise Trail to Black Mountain Trail is highly recommended for a11 mile loop.<//text>

< review>
This is perfect place for walking, running, cycling, picnic or drone flying. They have spearate path for cyclers at many places. The area is huge and connects more then 10-20 trails. They have barn also inside which was a nice surprise for us. There are multiple places for picnic too. They have 3 parking lots, the first and second one are small but the last parking lot at the bottom is big. They have drone flying zone near first and second parking lot. This is the default place if I am not able to find a good trail to go for a weekend run, thus I have been here multiple times.<//review>

I would give this place a 5 but parking is EVIL.  There's hardly ever any parking,  bring a lucky person with you when you visit.  If you're able to secure a spot, you'll enjoy this place.  It's good for families and kids and there's a small farm with goats and chickens.

Good place for long distance runs, varying surfaces and good for trail running</review>

This trail is so nice and peaceful. Many trail and has a animal farm for kids to play in. Beautiful color changing tree leaves. It can be cold or super hot defending g where you're hiking, make sure you have enough water. PG&E trail is very long and some part are pretty hard. View is amazingly nice<//text>

I've been going here since I was a kid. Parking is improved and there are a number of trails well kept and of differing length and difficulty, took my infant here and could have done the stroller instead of the carrier with the paved trail to deer hollow farm.<//Text>

Plenty of parking. Very nice hilly trails to run. They recently created One Way routes for most -used narrow trails in respect to "social distancing", so go to the home main page to take a look at the trail maps for new/diverted routes before planning your hike or....just follow the new One Way signs when you encounter them. Happy hiking, stay healthy!<//text>

<Review>Lots of trails and great views and the farm is a nice touch, but the parking here has gotten worse with time. At 8:30 this morning all the lots were full.

The bit of the trail that’s under construction is said to open later this year in 2020, and hopefully there’s more parking then.</Review>< Pics>

<text>Very easy hike, at least the first mile to the farm.  Our hike today included an encounter with a rattle snake. It was in the intersection of several popular trails so the park rangers moved it to a safer location. It was also a nice lesson for the kids that “we are in their house”.</text><Gmap_id>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e<//Gmap_id><user_id>106601860359817443699<//user_id><Date>1557928388988< /Date>< pics>

Beautiful area, able parking, perfect for families, hikes and joggers alike. A good mix of paved trails for bikes and strollers and hiking trails. It also had a small farm with cows, sheep, chickens etc. For the kids. A family of deer laying around is great too.</Text>

Urban hiking, Parking can be tough at busy times. PGE trail is arduous takes about 3 hours but lots of other smaller loops and trails. Can be crowded at times.</Review>

<Name>Indra Singhal</Name><Date>1567965447094<//Date><rating>4</rating><text>This preserve and the trails were my regular weekly haunt years ago. Went back to see how it's changed - 7:40 am on a Sunday morning - and i found the lower parking lot completely full. Saw a few cars occupying two slots, now that's on them.

This preserve has a variety of trails - there is one that will match your own desire for level of activity. From the parking lot, you can tell this is a very popular place - so if you like walking with lots of people, kids, babies in strollers, joggers, this is the place to be! If not, there are hundreds of trails in dozens of open space preserves in the south bay...<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Went for the first time this weekend with a friend and hiked a decently inclined hill, so I noticed if folks wanted a even easier trek there were some nice flatland trails as well. It was pretty populated but that wasn't surprising since it's so close to town but it was a gorgeous get away and we saw so many little cottontails and deer off in the distance. My favorite wildlife surprise was the rafter of turkeys we saw close to sunset! It was also need to see people flying there model plains out there. The people watching was just as good as the walking!</Text>

Great hiking place with shades, restrooms and fountain water. The deer hallow farm is good place for kids. Nice 1 mile walk from parking lot. The staff and volunteers are very helpful and friendly. I will certainly visit again...< /Review>

<Review>Nice ranch! Lots of beautiful wildlife. I would recommend going there but stay on trail as there are lots of snakes and I once accidentally got near one while staying on trail, so be careful there don’t go in the bushes while hiking.
There at the entrance is a parking lot and bathroom. Another nice thing is that when you get inside the rancho there is a huge plain and on it is a picnic area shaded by a large tree.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>My favorite place for trail running near Mountain View. Rancho has miles of well-maintained trails, all marked with signs to keep you going in the right direction. You'll get to see a variety of plant and animal life here, from bay trees to California thrashers. Keep an eye out for interesting mushrooms, too. Got kids? They'll love the working farm, which keeps chickens, goats, and pigs. Parking can be difficult, especially on weekend mornings.</review>< Pics>

Very scenic open preserve. The entrance and parking is free compared to other state parks. The trails are well maintained and very scenic. It's a great place for evening walk and morning hike if you live in south bay area.</review>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Have been running here twice a week for almost 20 years. Many trails, short and long, can take you up all the way to Black Mountain (about 16 miles round trip, 2500ft climb). A lot of wildlife to see, primarily deer and turkeys, some birds, and occasionally a coyote. Easy access, however parking can be challenging at popular visit hours.</Review>< Pictures>

As a hike, it's pretty easy. A fair amount of wildlife (mostly turkeys, other birds, rabbits, deer, etc.), and on most days, there's a nice view of the valley. Parking can be difficult on weekend mornings.</Text>

The trails were ok, but probably not enough to justify the crowd and the difficulty parking.  We arrived at 8:30am in the morning on a Sunday, and despite four large parking lots, could not find a single place to park because it was so crowded.  Then on the trails, it was filled with even more people.  It was just too crowded.<//text>

We went on Sunday afternoon! A lot of people! Recently they are making some of the trails one-way so people don’t have to run into each other. However the “one-way” instructions are a bit confusing because some of them are not one way and they might be connected to one-way trails without further instruction . We end up walking into a one-way trail with wrong direction and was very embarrassed when people come tell us that we are in the wrong direction. Beautiful scenery though!< /review>

Beautiful trails, turkeys, deer, birds, bunnies!  Various trails of different lengths.  Great views from the top.  Parking is challenging in the am...just be patient...A space will free up.<//Review>

<Review>Amazing trails around here. This place has plenty of parking (there are many lots but still you come late, you will find it hard to get one). I did the wild cat loop trail which was really good. There is a short one you can do or make it longer, depends on how much distance you want to go. The moment to trail the trails at entrance, there are maps detailing the route. I THINK you can also go to the Black Mountain through one of the trail paths!< /Review>< userid>

The place is great for a day hike or a morning run to the top of the mountain. The first 3km are pretty flat. After that is all uphill. Trees become more scarce half way to the top so is a good idea to wear susncreen and glasses. Parking gets very crowded very early in the morning during weekends. If you want to make sure to find parking arrive before 6am. Bathrooms are located in the parking lot and water fountains are available. There is also a small farm where you can buy organic eggs and other vegetables.<//Text>

Not a bad trail, has lots of stiffer to options for any levels of expertise. I didn’t come across any wildlife but there were lots of advice if you did. The views from the summit are very good and the facilities are also up to scratch<//Text>

Nice open space preserve run by the city of mountain view. Plenty of parking (although it can be quite tough to find parking during peak park hours), free entry, some really good hikes. This preserve has something to offer for all. Deer hollow farm and small hikes for the young ones. PG&E and black mountain for anyone looking for a longer hike. High meadow Vista point hike if you want a quick hike for the day. Almost always spot deer and turkey on the trails when we hike here.< /Text>

A few long trails. Some are uphill, and requires some good lungs! There is a tennis court 1/2 mile in on the north side on a trail and that one leads to the petting zoo as well. The trails uphill are long and it's best to do them in the early AM...when it's not so hot. It can get VERY hot there. Not alot of tree cover on many areas on the trails. They have bathrooms by one parking lot only. We have seen a rattle snake there and bunnies, wild Turkeys etc.Views are great over the valley when up on the trails. Nice few hours in the woods. For being in CA, it's not too bad! Bring LOTS of water!<//review>

Great place for a hike. Many families come during the weekend so it can get crowded. The farm is a popular place for the kids. The trails are for all skill levels although some areas can be pretty steep. some areas also good for wedding photography, and mountain biking.<//review>

Its beautiful to be sure and lots of chances to see different wildlife at a leisurely pace, but the limited parking compared to the massive numbers of potential clientele makes the parking a nightmare. If you don't go early, especially on weekends, you'll end up stalking parking spaces for leavers for ages.<//Text>

Absolutely a running/walking heaven. Anything from a cute little walk to the farm with kids to a 17miles hike/run and anything in between. They have maps when you enter so really easy to navigate and choose the right route for you. My favorites are: to the farm and upper Wildcat for about a 7 miles loop. Enjoy!</Text>

<Text>I really enjoy this trail. Easy to get to. Lots of parking. Good trails. Not a ton of people.

Let's start from the beginning. Parking. This reserve has a lot of full sun areas so most people are here before 9am on weekends. They have multiple lots, but the bottom most lot is the largest and is closest to the reserve entrance and bathrooms. The closer to 9am you get there, the harder it'll be to find a spot.

As for the trails itself, wear trail running shoes or sneakers you're okay with getting dirty. It's all dirt paths. Also watch out for horse poop.

Bikers are allowed in parts but dogs are not. Parking is also free.

They have bike lanes but they're not labeled well so everyone just walks wherever. It's never been a problem when I've been there though because the paths are wide.

As for the trails itself. There's a lot of shorter ones that when combined, become longer hikes. We've always gone to the lookout points so you get a 4 mile uphill climb to about 1000ft, then 4 miles back down. You can combine some so they're 11-13 miles if you want something longer or more difficult. Same with the other way around. You can stay on the flatter beginning path for an easier walk.

As for the sights, they got it going on. Lookout trails have beautiful views. Tons of nature, hills and views like the Apple donut campus, NASA building and redwood City salt mines (are they mines?... Lake?...)... They also have goats. So that's cute.

Most trails are part sun and part shade so wear breathable clothing, hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen. I've definitely seen some women wearing very little because of the heat, but they're beat red and don't even realize how burnt they are.

Trails are pretty wide for the most part. A few spots where we walk single file because of hikers coming the other way. These are not trails for strollers. If you bring one, stick to the easy flat part only, don't attempt the harder hikes because of the elevation.

They have bathrooms at the lowest level parking lot, and two portapotties further in on the flat area. No bathrooms higher up.

Overall, it's a really nice hike that's quiet and challenging but not too long. I also like that the first half is uphill while the second part is downhill. I've definitely done it the other way and that's less fun.< /Text><gmapID>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e<//gmapID>< pics>

When we got there, most of the trails were closed due to mountain lion activity. I would certainly like to have explored more. The trails we were on, we're not as shady as we are used to, so I prefer some of my other trails. Nevertheless if this place were open I imagine it would be quite delightful.< /Review>

Be sure to go on a week day morning if you want a parking space. Trails get busy on weekends, sometimes with large noisy groups and even some people carrying mini-boom boxes while hiking. If all you want is a noisy place to walk please spare the rest of us the noise and go to the mall. Let the rest of us escape from the hustle bustle of city Life and enjoy the peace and quiet of nature.</Review>

I have been there twice ! It is always fun to go there with friends or family and have experiences together. It is recommended if you have never been here. Good to be out in summer to have a great picnic and fun with family. Water rides are amazing too. Park is huge and can keep you busy the whole day.< /review>

Great trails here, yet too many people on a weekend. Stick to higher elevations and steep trails to avoid the crowd. Nice flat garden area with animals. Check out the goats! Parking can be a challenge.</Text>

<Text>Great for hiking.  Watch out if your car is parked in the lot after park closes.  You will get a ticket.  Deer Hollow Farm is a sweet spot for farm animals.</Text></record>

They have 3 parking areas but they can fill up on weekends and holidays causing you to have to wait for people to leave. There are a number of trail options but hiking to the top via the PG&E trail gives you the best workout and the best view. The trail has a good amount of shade so even on the warmest days you will get some relief. If you hike early enough you might see some deer and wild turkeys. There are always a good number of people there so you won’t feel as though you are out in the wilderness by yourself.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Text>A convenient park for elevation and distance training. Quick one-hour loops to comfortable half-day hikes. Preferable to Mission Peak for hot and cloudless days thanks to shade on many stretches of trail. The animal farm is a popular attraction (but not always open). Trails are muddy after rain. Reception is pretty solid throughout the park. Parking is free, but can be a challenge on swell days. Restrooms available at trailheads.<//Text></record>

Most trails are loops and there are maps you can pick up on your way in to plan your route. I really like the Rogue Valley trail for a moderate hike, but I never get tired of exploring and trying new trails. There's a lot of parking, but it does tend to fill up - don't worry though if it says "Parking Full" when you get there, people are always leaving and I've never not found a parking spot.</Text>< Rate>

<Text>This park is one of my favorites to go for a quick hike/bike ride. It’s suitable and easy enough for all ages. There are great trails and some amazing views. Every time I go, there are deers and turkeys roaming around everywhere.
There are multiple lots for you to park at. Parking on weekdays doesn’t seem to be too bad, but on weekends I recommend getting there early (like before 8am).< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e< /GmapID></record>

I always go running here, every chance I get. Its a great place to just get away and enjoy ones peace at mind. I've been going here ever since I was a youngster with my mom, dad, and sister.
Now I go buy myself just to run. Usually I go Thursday's and Friday's.< /Review>

<Review>Popular, expansive park... great for trail running (with challenging climbs), lots of groups hiking & running... avoid weekend mornings, unless you get there pretty early... you'll be driving around a while looking for a place to park...the 5(!) parking lots fill up quickly.  Family friendly animal farm on-site, with cows, goats, ducks, and hungry chickens (which they let older kids feed).  Docents around to educate you.  Yes, cows are really huge up close...<//Review>< Date>

Hiking is great and I love seeing the animals at the end. I generally go up on the left side then cross over and come down to the farm. Negative a star because parking is sometimes hard to find.</Text>

<Text>It's an awesome outdoor loci where it has something for everybody. I see folks flying drones and model planes on the upper fields next to a paved parking area. As you drive down the road l, there're more parking spots; and there's a public restroom in the middle of the parking lot that I consider clean and no signs of drug use. Rangers patrol this area quite often, they're knowledgable and eager to help. There are multiple trails but every one but the Black Mountain Trail (high elevation gain) is easy. Not into hiking? No worries. There's an animal farm in the area too so everyone is welcomed!</Text>< resp>

Such a wonderful place to hike. There are flat trails that are good for strollers and more inclined trails if you want something harder. I've only gone with my baby so I've stuck with the easier hikes, but it looks like there's plenty for a real hike.

My son loves seeing the turkeys and deer wandering around.< /Review>

It is kids friendly park where there is Deer Hallow Farm which is a petting zoo and open for everyone. There is a hiking trail of round trip around 4.6 from parking lot to the Vista point. The Vista point has a nice view looking towards south Bay.  Park is very beautiful and green, especially after the rain.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOusXIOxPfCC3tTRm1RI4zNXpVyKfJOYkPPpEgc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZESl5XjZ17zTO7DJNpavrHEYWgnLM2vrTrxBw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Very nice hiking trail with well preserved nature. Combine some trails, we can make different length and difficulty level trails. Along the trail, we can see many insects, lizards, deers and wild  turkeys.  Around farm gets a bit crowded with many children. It is nice working farm and number of farm animals out all the time. There are a few parking areas, however so many people visit the park, parking can be challenge especially on weekends.< /Review>

There is a small farm at the bottom of the field, which houses sheeps, goats, hens, and rabbits. The hike has some shaded and some non- shaded areas, so it could be a little sunny on a hot day.

Hiked on a hot 90 degree day so left my phone in the car. Liked this trail a lot. These winding trails have more shade than The Dish and more sightings of baby deers💕💕. My only regret is not bringing small snacks along to eat later at the picnic area following the hike.<//Text>

If you come before 4 pm you get to interact with farm animals. That's always fun for kids and adults alike. There are plenty of hikes for all levels. To top it all, we almost always encounter deers, brush rabbits, California quails, and turkeys.< /Review>

I love walking here. Very peaceful and away from the city madness. Excellent place for walking, running and bike riding. A lot of trails. In my walk today, I came across deer, wild turkeys, a rabbit, small lizards, and a small green snake with red stripes!<//text>

<review>This is a beautiful place for hikes, picnics, runs, bike rides with family and friends, weekends and weekdays. Hide up to Vista Point from the many trails options, and see a great view of the valley. Even SF and Oakland are visible on a clear day. You can see deer, squirrels, lizards, rabbits, snakes, turkeys, and bluejays. Bobcats and mountain lions have also been sighted. The farm is great-pigs, goats, cows, herbs, flowers. This place is on my favorites list. Parking can be hard but with patience, you can get a space.< /review><user_name>Wilson Steven<//user_name>< resp>

<Text>I love the trails BUT hate parking here. People will just wait at an enterence until a spot opens up and cause everything to back up. I wish they have better security circling around to make people move or have signs that say no waiting/stopping. I would just park on the streets and walk all the way to the trail. It's far but at least you don't have to deal with that.< /Text>< Pictures>

S.Antonio rancho is a wonderful  place to hike
It is very safe and pleasant place to walk. My wife and I are using the park for many years except on weekends where it's impossible to go because you can't park due to the crowds.<//Review>

<Text>To be honest, I have known Rancho San Antonio since childhood and the park has always served quite a few purposes. I never really used the tennis courts or the exercise structure but I have heavily relied on the decently sized flying field and the brilliant hiking trails that this park has to offer.

I wish I could give this place a 5 star review but ever since they added the strict rules and regulations for the flying field, it never was quite the same as it was for decades on end.<//Text>< pics>

Such a beautiful place I kinda hate to tell everyone how nice it is because I'd like to keep it a better secret.  If you want the perfect place to get out of the city without driving for hours this is your place.  Great clean tails with and without elevation,  some paved and some dirt.  Great for hiking, biking, picnicing and mostly relaxing.  There's a nicely mowed grass airfield with wind velocity and wind socks for flying your model planes,  helicopters or drones.  Public bathrooms are available at the beginning of the trails and more just after Deer Farm where the is a petting and viewing area of all the animals.  Parking is the only down side. And it's not terrible.  Early in the day and later in the day it's never a problem. I'm just thankful they haven't wiped away more nature to pave more parking.  If you enjoy the outdoors this is your place... but don't tell anybody else let's keep this gem a secret!</text>

December no one is there, April crowded! Can be hard to find parking and the trails can be packed. After 2 miles you will be free of the crowds, and more than likely see me.</text>

I could use a better map. It most likely me but I get lost a lot. Take kids but keep their bikes on the paths you do not want to run over a poor little snake. Stay on paths and you will have no problems. It has a great area and people flying planes and drones. I recommend this park highly never gets old.<//text>

I've been here a couple of times and I always love it. It's a nice hike through the trails and when you get higher up you can see a lot of the silicon valley. You get some cool tree shade throughout a part of the hike on the wildcat loop trail.There are bathrooms & water fountains at the very last parking lot.  Keep in mind though that the parking lots get pretty full especially on the weekends.< /review>

<Text>This is my favorite place to run and  hike. You will see an abundance of beautiful terrain and have some really nice pushes for cardio burn. There is an abundance of wild life as well- wild turkeys, predatory birds, salamanders, deer and maybe, hopefully not though, mountain lion. Bring water. Bring vibes. Bring family. Being your horse even.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><GmapID>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e</GmapID><date>1554815854588<//date><userid>117826177164052388685</userid>< response>

One of the best hiking trails in bay area. Weekends parking is hard but not impossible. Weekday evenings are best times to go<//Text>

<review>One of the easier hiking options in Bay Area. Parking is an issue. I came at 7 am and had to roam for 40 minutes to get a parking. You have options for hiking, from 3 miles to 10 miles. And not very tiring too. Pretty plain. Very good for moderate workout.<//review><gmapID>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e<//gmapID><rate>4<//rate><Name>Venkatasubramanian D< /Name>< Date>

I live right near the park and it is a dream come true. I do hikes ranging 4 miles to 8.5. I have memorized the trails in this park. I was hiking an someone asked me for directions and I led them straight where the wanted to go. It is a beautiful place. I am so blessed to live in a town with such a beautiful space to take a leisurely walk or a hard-core uphill hike. Rancho is an amazing park and I hope I will be able to enjoy for years to come.<//review>

<text>Took our kids here a few times and it's always a fun time. From spotting wildlife to checking out Deer Hallow Farm and climbing on trees the whole family is entertained. There are multiple hikes and a wide variety of difficulty which is great as if both kids are on foot we stick to flat ones that they can handle. Highly recommend checking it out!</text></record></dataset><record>

Nice, shady trails. You can do a short farm loop, or long hikes with beautiful views. The farm has pigs, goat, sheep, etc.
Parking situation is not great in weekends even though there is a lot of parking since it's a very popular spot. Arrive early morning or around 1 PM to find easier parking.<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><name>Srikumar Chari</name><text>A remarkable park!! Lots of different levels of hikes, there's one for every skill level. Parking lot to farm - great for toddlers, go past farm towrds wild cat loop trail - beginners but make sure you turn back before the hills, mid level you can go up the hill but turn back before the last extremely steep hill. PGE trail (Abbors trail) - a difficult hike but even there you can turn it into a mid hike but crossing over near the first electric pole on hike, but if you continue make sure you really are used to a difficult hike. TAKE WATER!!

The views of the valley are spectacular with a lot of photo ops if you are into that.<//text><Date>1568462903676< /Date>< Gmap_id>

A great place to go trail running, be prepared to encounter plenty of walkers here. Can connect to other parks to create a long distance course if you take the proper trails.<//text>

The trails are are hilly and full of people; kids on bikes or kids running around, adults walking in groups, etc. It is very hard to find parking here; Uber or bike or show up at dawn, or just go somewhere else. Deer Hollow farm is in a canyon that is 10 degrees colder than the surrounding area so bring gloves and extra layers in the winter if you get cold easily. You can usually see deer here and sometimes turkeys. There are some views of the South Bay if you hike a few miles.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Different trails to explore. Each has its own beauty and difficulty level varies. Every trail is suited for hike across all the seasons. You can see wild life like dears, turkeys, wild squirrels and other species. Go either early or late to get parking. Yes , valley looks beautiful from vista point.< /Review>

The open space preserve is adjacent to the Rancho San Antonio county park. Lots of easy hiking trails through pretty terrain. Look for deer, coyote, and occasional mountain lions. Parking is very difficult on weekends, so come early if you must bring your car. Bicycles are not allowed on dirt trails.< /Review>

We took the shortest hike because we have a stroller. It was easy and good for young kids who are walking by their own. Passed by the third largest bay tree in California. Saw the farm animal at the end. On the way back saw 4 deers. Overall very suitable for our kids age group (2-7).<//text>

<Review>Beautiful and extensive trails offering an open feeling with plenty of sunshine. Lots of trail options to appeal to a broad section of population. You can go rugged and do hills or opt to stay on flat paved walks. Plenty of miles. Very popular so parking on weekend mornings are nearly impossible past 9:3am.<//Review>< pics>

Went to the park on a long weekend, it was very crowded but we managed to get a parking spot in a few mins (feels easy enough to get a spot anytime). I personally liked it much better than going to mission peak. Beautiful trails and lush green grass amid some tree line made it a nice and easy hike. Most of the trails are flat except a couple of them.<//review>

Loved coming here for a hike with a friend and by toddler. Great retreat away from the busy lives of the silicon valley. Can't believe it is so close to the hustle and bustle of city life. I only walked on the east route but saw so many options for those who don't have a stroller. Restrooms were clean. Parking is hard to get but I got lucky on a weekday. Spotted 20+ deers so close to us. My toddler loved seeing the sheep and goats too.<//text>

< Review>
Rancho San Antonio is a preserve that combines both accessibility (it is right on the border of Los Altos/Los Altos Hills) and enough miles of trails to pack in a serious hike for the day. You could hike nearly 19 miles from the main parking lot up to Black Mountain and back, or you can exit the preserve at Hidden Villa and get ferried back from Moody Road to your car. The main area, within a mile of the parking lot and the Deer Hollow farm can feel crowded on weekends, but start hiking out a mile, and you'll start to find the solitude enjoyed by most serious hikers.</Review>

Great place for a workout. I've been here multiple times. It can be very busy on weekends and after work. Good for a hiking workout and parts of it are good for running. There are shady spots, which is where I happen to see a few rattlesnakes, otherwise lots of areas of no shade and hot. Bring some water.< /review>

<Review>Great open space preserve, but not a lot of shade. Miles of trails and beautiful views while on your walk. There is ample free parking and bathrooms that are a little stinky.  There are water fountains to quench your thirst. I recommend you go early while it is cool.</Review>< Pics>

There is something for everyone here and it is just one of the many reasons this is a much better place to go than Mission Peak or Communication Hill. It is outdoors in a scenic area and the trails are well maintained. Just don't go after it rains. The trails very in length such as moderate trails like Wildcat Loop or much harder ones such as the PG&E trail. Although if you do the PG&E trail on a clear day you can see San Francisco not to mention the abundance of wildlife from deer to snakes.<//Review>

Wonderful place to hike. Parking can be difficult during busy times, mostly on weekends and holidays, in the morning. If you get an early start, you're fine. We usually do the Wildcat Loop, about 6-ish miles. We love it!</review>

Tons of great hiking that is super convenient if you live locally! There are definitely more scenic hikes out there, but it's hard to expect too much when it's surrounded by South Bay suburban sprawl. Still, I really like hiking here, and if you're willing to take the time to go further into the hills, there are some trails where you feel like you really are getting away and out into nature. If you live nearby, check it out!</Text>

I was really surprised at how much wildlife I saw along the trail.  Humming birds, quail, rabbits, chipmunks, lizards, mice, cool blue birds, and the list goes on.  The trails are very well maintained if not a little too wide.  Plenty of room to stretch your legs, but not enough room to escape the rude groups of people who think the trail is the perfect place for loud conversations.  It also seems impossible to get away from the buzz of high tension power lines in this area.<//Review>

<review>It is the closest open space to Sunnyvale. It has several vista points where you can see the bay area. There are many trails with different distances and difficulties.
You can hike all the way to the black mountain peak, which is 8 miles one way. You can also pick an short easy trail.
There are many runners running on the trails in the afternoon and evening. Trails are not that wide. Please always stay on right.<//review><Date>1465787942985< /Date><Response>None<//Response></record>

<text>Awesome nature here. It's not at all uncommon to see free range turkeys, deer, quail and of course lots of ground squirrels. And the farm is sure to be a great attraction for kids, with pigs, cows, ducks and chickens.
Besides the animals, the hike up towards the farm is admittedly kind of boring, lots of open space and not a lot of trees, it can be pretty brutal on the hottest days, but once you get into the forest it's quite pleasant.<//text><UserId.>102446199106730395162</UserId.><name>Jay Paroline<//name><pics>None< /pics>< Rating>

<review>This is a nice place to hike with your family, friends, or by yourself. It's not very challenging;however, it has some steep climb at times. Remember to take the trail leading to the animal farm! Enjoy the breeze and the sound of water running along the creek, it's beautiful.<//review><response>None<//response>< name>

<Review>No winding roads to get here. Quick drive from Central San José. We arrived around 10 am on a Saturday and the couple of parking lots they have were full but people were coming and going so finding a spot was easy. The trails are very well maintained and mostly shaded. There were children on bikes, scooters, wagons, and strollers and many elderly people, so I would say the trails are fairly easy to hike, not a lot of elevation. My 3 year old hiked for almost 4 miles with no complaints. Perfect for beginner hikers. The farm, with chickens, goats, sheep, and pigs, was a plus.<//Review><username>Virginia Cisneros< /username></record>

Good place for hiking. Recommended going there early during the weekend to do d parking, because this place attracts a lot of crowds. I did the PG&E trail to reach the vista point and took the night medow trail back to the parking lot, which makes for a good 8 mile hike. I also saw some deer.</Text>

I've hiked every trail in this preserve and I will never get tired of them. The parking lot can get a little busy, but they're adding an extension to it so it'll be better very soon. Great place for running, hiking, bird watching, some horseback riding, and there's even a little farm! This is my go to place to take friends for a day hike anywhere from 2 to 16 mile loop trails.</review>

<text>Really well maintained and nice park. Good variety of trail loops for jogging, with moderate to steep climbs. Unfortunately, it has become very busy on weekends recently and the parking situation is a joke. Arrive anytime between 8:30 and afternoon and you'll be searching for a spot.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Parking can be a bit difficult, but otherwise it's great. Very big trails for walking in the beginning, well maintained hiking trails if you go further. Great views all around.</review>

Great place for hiking, views, running.  Visit the farm (with or without the kids).  Parking a challenge on weekends. You can hike all the way to the top of Black mountain (several hours each way).< /Text>

Beautiful open space with diverse wildlife (turkeys, deer, mountain lions, quails, bobcats, snakes, wild pigeons) variety of trails for short and longer hikes. And only few minutes drive from urban area. Probably the best open space preserve in the South Bay.</text>

This place is beautiful! My ex girlfriend used to take me here and we would go hiking, some of the best times of my life have been had here. It's kind of sad now to even see this place on maps... but one day I'll return.
Oh on a side note they need more biking areas.</text>

<text>Lots of trails, covered and open, ranging from easy to strenuous.  Also has a farm which is nice for the kids, but you have to hike to it (easy hike though!). Viewpoint on Upper High Meadow Trail is under an electrical tower and straight ahead view is restricted because of the overgrown brush but there is a bench and there is a nice view to the left and right.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>Parking may be an issue as this is a very popular place. Short walk to the farm makes it an attraction for parents with young kids. You can get a good exercise on the PG&E trail. Alternatively, you can take shorter trail.</review>< time>

It's a great place for nature lovers who hike on the 24 miles of hiking trails, enjoy the views and visit the zoo. Local residents bring their children to walk and visit the zoo. The zoo has pigs, goats and 1 cow. You also see visiting deer, turkeys and other birds and animals.< /review>

<Review>No better place to run for hard core and casual runners. Beautiful trails, wildlife, easy trails, a monster uphill advanced hill run, intermediate runs, hiking, horseback riding, it's all here. My favorite place to run in the Bay Area (a frequent visitor from Pittsburgh).<//Review>< Date>

Great for the family. They have a farm house with sheep, goats, rabbits, a few cows, and chickens. There's even an open air barn for lunching. Otherwise, truly an open space that gets super hot. Make sure to check the lot down the hill for parking.< /review>

There's plenty of trails to choose from, with differing lengths and difficulties. Huge (and free) parking lots and there are many amenities such as picnic areas, toilets, benches and drinking water.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>A great open space for hiking, which is very easily accessible.  Lots of easy hiking trails for the kids and the PG&E and black mountain trail for those looking for a good cardio workout. The petting zoo, picnic tables and the RC plane strip make this an ideal place for outing with the kids.< /Text>< pictures>

Good hike, withIn 20-30min of home, free animals viewing for kids and water stream. It has everything one require in this month to unwind from daily office routine. Parking can get tough iver weekend so my suggestion is to take whatever you get instead of trying to get closer to gate. There are multiple parking lots and last one has restrooms too.< /Text>

Love this place, I go for PG&E hiking trail from this place. This place has nice little farm, where kids can see cow, chicken, turkey, Horse.
The trails is beautiful, it has many paths. One, which goes around 1800 ft high has similar cardio as Mission peak. However this trail has shades and trees not like Mission peak. One path goes by stream, that is very beautiful.< /Text>

<text>Nice park but can be very crowded and difficult to park.   There are lots of nice parks in Santa Clara County but this is one of the few with free parking and a Children's "Deer Hollow Farm."   It's heavily used by the local Cross Country teams for practice.    The model airplane flying field is one of the few places where it's legal to fly.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e</gmap_id></record>

Lots of well maintained trails, and eating areas. Noticeably free of garbage despite the large amount of children. Even when it's packed you don't feel crowded. Little petting zoo about a mile up the trail with goats and other small farm animals.  Great for trail runners, no major inclines</review>

Great hike for anyone with a stroller or wheelchair. Great place for kids to see some animals in real life! And great play to spend a picnic in the park with FREE PARKING!</Text>

Wonderful place to go for a walk, hike or run. Parking can be tough on weekends but otherwise such a wonderful getaway from the daily hustle. Often can see deer and other animals. There's a farm about a mile in.<//Review>

Rancho San Antonio is a true hiker’s paradise right in the center of the hustle and bustle of Silicon Valley! It’s huge, just under 4,000 acres with 24 miles of hiking trails. The Open Space Preserve supplies a detailed map of all the trails, get a paper map at trail heads or PDF on website (paper map larger). You can hike an individual trail or combine a few to form loops of various lengths. Most trails are people-only, but there are some that allow bikes and horses (I avoid those – marked on map). There are 3 or 4 places where you can begin your hikes (parking can be a challenge on weekends, but weekdays are easy). I usually park at the end of Mora Drive, which gives you access to multiple trails. Trails vary in challenge. An easy beginner’s loop is the Rogue Valley trail, about 3 miles. If I want more of a challenge, the Chamise Trail is good, about 5 miles out and back and takes you through the Duveneck pasture, a quiet tranquil (400 foot elevation gain). The PG&E Trail is challenging, 4 miles with a 1,600 ft elevation gain. Wildcat Canyon is a good trail, shaded mostly, and brings you back to the Deer Hollow Farm where they keep some animals. Black Mountain is the most challenging, another 1,800 feet in elevation gain after you get to the end of the Chamise trail! Be in good hiking shape and take your time! Take lots of water with you on hot days! Don’t step on the lizards! (Western Swifts are everywhere).< /review>

Nice area, a bit crowded. Many runners and hikers around. Nature is nice but farm is a wreck, for tourists only.<//review>

<text>I was on a business trip to the South Bay area (San Jose, Mountain View) for the week.  I wanted a hike and love elevation.  We took the 7 mile PG&E trail.  It was a good workout and gave a great view of the Bay.  There are several loops you can do if you aren't interested in the one I did.

I did it early in the morning and saw tons of bunnies as well as a few deer.< /text>< Pictures>

Love coming here. It has something for everyone. For families, the trails are easy to run on, and on certain days there is a small farm with goats and other animals for the kids to see.

For the runners, there's enough paths where you can leave the crowd and go on to more challenging runs. They have nice vista points to reward yourself to getting the top. Parking can be tough but not impossible, it's ok to park up the hill. You're going to be walking anyways.< /review>

<Text>I'm sure it's been said a million times already, but they desperately need more parking. The one consistency of this place is that you can count on circling for parking unless you show up at some very odd hour.</Text>< Pics>

All kinds of trails that you can think of, easy to moderate to hard, both in terms of elevation and distance. If you're a trail lover, you'll find your favorite American trail right here. Being under half an hour's drive from anywhere in the South Bay, this is a haven for all the Silicon Valley folk. Love this, and will miss it sorely if and when I do leave NorCal.</review>

When I lived in the Bay Area,  this was my favorite place to hike.   It is absolutely beautiful.   If you hike to the top of the hill,  you can see the whole Bay Area on a clear day.   However,  being a dog person.  I am disappointed that they don't allow dogs here anymore.   Perhaps too many folks let them off leash and craziness ensued?< /Review>

Hiking trails to accommodate many ability levels. Hike to the barn the first time. Then later as you develop take the pro-trails like PG&E and WildCat, it'll work-ya.<//review>

What a contrast to the gridlocked concrete torture of Silicon Valley.
Only 20 minutes drive from there, u can quickly experience that  kind of arid, almost starched beauty that reflects this region well. The hike is quite easy, with a wide mostly paved pathways snaking around the hills. The views are spectacular of the mellow landscape. Shame about the obscene electric power lines... 1 star less for that.
Honestly after a dog-eat-dog binary-focused day trapped in the tentacles of whatever tech business u slave away for, this is like sinking smoothly into a lush golden bath of melodies that stroke ur soul.<//Text>

Awesome park for running and hiking. Unlike other parks in the peninsula, this one allows non-millionaires to enter and enjoy the beauty of the views. Parking is really hard on the weekends so if you have time on the weekdays is the best time to go. Otherwise go very early<//text>

I enjoy hiking rancho San Antonio because of its mix of trails and the farm where you can see animals. My only criticisms of the park would be the first part of the walk is fairly boring and long to get to real trails and that parking is a pain. I feel like we find parking only 50% of the time but at least it is free.< /Text>

Absolutely perfect.... Except for HORRIBLE parking. Needs more public transit options, or set up shuttles from nearby empty office lots on weekends. Open the new flood plain to parking on no-rain days or when the reservoir is below danger level.< /Review>

Fantastic park near Mountain View. Follow the trail up for a great view of the southern part of the of the San Francisco Bay. Model airplane enthusiasts fly their planes on some days. Come early and see the wild turkeys and deer. I heard there are also mountain lions and bobcats, but only saw a bobcat in the far distance once years ago.<//Review>

Wildcat Loop Trail -> Upper Wildcat Canyon Trail is beatiful and pleasant. It starts right after Deer Hollow Farm. It is mostly shaded, covered by leaves, alongside small stream, not much of elevation. However the way between the parking lots and Deer Hollow Farm (1 mile) has almost no shadow and can be very hot during summer (and also crowdy).< /review>

A nice hike in the south bay. The trail was gravel for a little while, and does run through some power lines. Also, be careful of ticks!< /text>

Awesome place to trail run but parking is always a problem on the weekends. If that is when you plan to visit, I suggest looking for a friend or family member that can drop you off and pick you back up later.< /review>

Great walking paths, lovely trails and farm with animals. Model aircraft field an added bonus and was something extra to look at. Only downside was that parking was extremely difficult, even on a midweek morning.<//text>

<Review>Five stars only based on the memory I had of going to this place around 2007 - 2009. Now, yes, I do the favor of introducing people to the dizzying number of turns and intersections of this place before cutting them loose to visit on their own, but it is no longer the weekly weekend trek of the grueling PG&E trail or just to get outside for one of the quicker, easier loops. PARKING has become a stress-inducer. People have gotten ugly. I have witnessed a parking confrontation primarily due to the arrogance of one driver and nearly became involved in one myself had I arrived just seconds sooner. Throughout the years, the grounds and trails have been well maintained, though I attribute the wider trails to people not staying within the boundaries. Wildlife sightings are hit or miss, but I have seen a banded snake, a rattlesnake that was within striking distance but luckily too young to know that I was a potential threat, deer, turkey, hares, pheasants, ground squirrels, birds of flight that I'm too ignorant to identify, and my favorite: a California Newt. So, if you don't know any better, have never been, want to get outside, need to work in some cardio, like nature's creatures, then try the place out. You'll figure out when to go so actually can find a parking spot. And people of all ages are afoot on weekends, so it really is a place for a everyone - hence its popularity.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Review>I love hiking here, the trails are beautiful and well maintained.  However, the parking situation is awful, so few spots for the size of this park.  The wealthy neighborhood next door to the parking lot, where every house has at least a 2 car garage and a driveway, has recently instituted permit only street parking which makes the situation even more frustrating.  I pay my taxes that pave your road and ya'll have more than enough space to park your Teslas and BMWs.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

For  hiking alone ,it is a good place but I found it very dry and dusty in some parts .I have been here 3 times and I feel the deer hollow farm is a good place for kids to watch domestic farm animals ..apart from that the hike is okay if not great.</review>

A wonderful place to hike. It gets pretty crowded weekend mornings. You can see the wild deer and coyotes if you're lucky. There are organized tours for kids about Ohlone culture. You can get an Uber to and from this place during the day.<//text>

Really nice mixed use park. The park is large and has miles of nicely maintained hiking trails and pathways. Even though it is right in Cupertino, it feels secluded and scenic</text>

Good hike - many many different trails here with varying lengths / height variances! Signage was relatively good for a complex set of trails. The view could be slightly better (perhaps if I had tried a more difficult hike it wouldve been better)< /Review>

I was saddened by the end of our walk many years ago by the area you call the "farm". I am appalled by the breeding of the sows you have there and the cute little piglets that will have to be slaughtered for bacon on somebody's pizza. Please consider the humane route. It would be far better to save the ones who are downed en route to slaughter. Please stop raising pigs for meat! Thank you, N. Chiodo, (back to being an Oregonian).< /text>

The trails here are well-maintained and not too difficult, so it's perfect for a relaxing hike for people of all ages. Many parts of the trails have plenty of tree cover, so don't be too worried about being sunburned. The park is super popular, so it may be difficult to find a parking spot.</Review>

It's nice Trails but the nicer ones are just for walking and people don't know how to stay on their Trail and Rangers just sit in the car or on bike texting or on Facebook must be nice overall nice place but a little crowded at times to find parking<//Review>

Great place for hiking, and gives options for tougher hikes or leisure ones. Nice views too, but has a large negative in that parking is very hard to find during busier times.</Text>

This place feels like a whole other world compared to the cities close by! I love to go here on my days off to relax and get a good workout in. The trails here connect to other trails to get you all along the bay area!</text>

For 4 years I hiked these trails almost every day--the animals knew me!

This is a very special place. I hope it's cherished and preserved for many generations.< /Text>

It's a good place to take kids, there are easy hikes (long walk) and a fun farm to visit.  Parking was very crowded and it took half an hour of circling, so carpool if you're going in groups.</Review>

Easy access to the South Bay and Peninsula for some good nature time. At certain times of day it is crowded and loud and detracts from the beauty of the Area. Try to go when there are less people.</Review>

Parking is a problem
The place is nice and all, but there is no point going on the weekend. The park soaks up a lot of people, but all parking areas are packed from before 7am.</review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) A very nice place to enjoy with the family.
You can go have a picnic, you can ride a bike, you can walk or run.

There are various animals, and various paths to choose from.

They have several parking lots but they fill up so you will walk around until you find one.

They have toilets.

The place is clean.

What I recommend is to put more garbage cans in the canine since I found several bottles of water thrown away and those harm the animals and insects of the place.

But I recommend it 100%

(Original)
Un lugar muy bonito para disfrutar en familia.
Puedes ir hacer un picnic, puedes pasear en bicicleta, puedes caminar o correr.

Hay varios animales, y diversos caminos para elegir.

Tienen varios estacionamientos pero se llenan así que vas dar una vueltas hasta encontrar uno.

Tienen servicios higiénicos.

El lugar es limpio.

Lo que si recomiendo es poner mas tachos de basura en el canino ya que encontré varias  botellas de agua tiradas y esos dañan a los animales e insectos del lugar.

Pero lo recomiendo al 100%</Review>

(Translated by Google) It is a good place to be with children. There is also a course where you can enjoy more than an hour of trail while you are pulling a stroller, and you can climb the mountain and see the Silicon Valley. There are deer farms in the middle, and there are many people who can see sheep and pigs. There is also a place where you can eat lunch in the middle, so it is a good place to take lunch and hike.
The parking lot is quite wide, but there are a lot of people, so when I arrived at 12 o'clock, it took about 10 minutes to park. At 2 o'clock there were more than 10 cars waiting. Please refer to parking time ~

아이들과 함께하기 좋은곳입니다. 유모차를 끌고도 한시간 이상의 트레일을 즐길수 있고 등산을 해서 실리콘밸리를 조망할수 있는 코스도 있숩니다. 중간에 사슴농장이 있는데 양과 돼지 소 등등을 볼수있어서 사람들이 많이 있슺니다. 중간중간 도시락을 먹을수 있는곳도 있어서 도시락을 챙겨서 하이킹 하기에도 좋은 곳입니다.
주차장은 꽤 넓지만 사람도 엄청 많아서12시에 갔을때 10분정도 주차가 걸렸고 2시에는 10대 넘는 차가 대기하고 있었습니다. 주차시에 참고 해주세요~</text>

(Translated by Google) Beautiful place to walk! Lovely livestocks in Deer Hollow Farm. Great scenery at a vista point.
A pleasant place to stroll and climb. When I visited in early May, I had plenty of parking space. There were quite a few people but it was very easy to walk. The scenery is beautiful, and you can see livestock such as sheep, goats, cattle, and chickens when you visit the farm. Be sure to visit Deer Hollow Farm. It takes 20 to 30 minutes from the entrance to the farm.
Wild turkeys are easy to see. I could see wild deer or rabbit, but I could not see it. If you climb the Vista point for 30 minutes on the farm, you can see the view from Mountain View to San Jose. There are many people who come to the stroller because the road is wide and flat. The vista point on the farm is not steep, but there is a little slope and a narrow section.

Beautiful place to walk! Lovely livestocks in Deer Hollow Farm. Great scenery at a  vista point.
산책하고 등산하기 쾌적한 장소. 5월 초에 방문했을 때는 주차할 곳이 넉넉했음. 사람이 꽤 있었지만 길이 넓은 편이라 걷기 편했음. 경치도 아름답고 농장에 방문하면 양, 염소, 소, 닭 같은 가축을 직접 볼 수 있음. Deer Hollow Farm은 꼭 방문하길. 농장까지는 입구에서 20~30분이면 도착.
야생 칠면조는 쉽게 볼 수 있음. 야생 사슴이나 토끼도 볼 수 있다고 하는데 보지는 못했음. 농장에서 30분 정도 등산하면 나오는 Vista point에 올라가면 마운틴뷰부터 산호세까지 전경을 볼 수 있어서 아름다움. 농장까지는 길이 넓고 평탄해서 유모차를 끌고 오는 사람도 많음. 농장에서 vista point는 길이 험하지는 않지만 경사가 조금은 있고 길이 좁은 구간이 있음.</text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Great vacation spot with the whole family. Huge area. And almost in the city. You can get acquainted with wild animals and domestic animals. You can ride bicycles and even horses. We saw deer, heron, wild turkeys, a lot of earthen squirrels. Maybe not enough benches. Parking is problematic at the weekend.

(Original)
Прекрасное место отдыха всей семьёй. Огромная площадь. И практически в городе. Можно познакомиться и с дикими животными и с домашними. Можно кататься на велосипедах и даже лошадях. Видели оленей, цаплю, диких индюшек, много земляных белок. Может маловато скамеек. Парковка проблематична в выходные.< /Review>< gmap_id>

<review>(Translated by Google) There are ups and downs. Moreover, the course is diverse and it seems that you can enjoy trail running. However, as I went deeper into the mountains, the number of people decreased, and there was a mountain lion sign, which made me a little scared. There are bears in Japan as well, though.

P & G is tight, but the slope is so loose that it is perfect for torelan training.

(Translated by Google) It's a little too crowded to struggle to park in the parking lot. The sunset over the bay area overlooking the summit is worth a visit.
