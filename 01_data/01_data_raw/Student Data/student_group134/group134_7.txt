<Text>Pizza was very good and well-prepared.  Too, I had confidence knowing the pizza was prepared with integrity.  Though I don't know the name of the young lady that brought out pizza for curbside delivery, she was polite, courteous and friendly.  I definitely will reorder at this location again.< /Text>< username>

<Text>Product is great, but the pizza was left outside near the bushes where i couldnt see it. Didnt hear the delivery arrive, so when i decided to see why it was taking so long i found the pizza near the bushes away from the door. The pizza was cold and full of ants.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

We received that pizza with no sauce only the cheese, chicken and onions. Since we were hungry we ate some of it also to notice it had no sauce. I called them and spoke to a guy who transferred me to Tina who is the manager she said and continue to tell me that per pizza hut they have an amount allowed for the bbq sauce but when I tried to explain that it had none she just keep saying I couldn’t add extra. She just ignored what I said that it had no sauce what so ever but she said she was the one that did the pizza. I always order this pizza never have I received it like this. She said since I didnt call right away and I shouldn’t of ate the pizza but hello they take 40 min and expect us to not eat when its their fault. She wanted me to send the pizza back and I said well I’ll send what I have but I ate most of it and she kept saying why u ate it if it had no sauce well bcuz I put my own barbecue sauce. The service was so poor she never apologized for it or the inconvenience she just kept saying she put the amount allowed by pizza hut guidelines. At the end I didnt want her to replace my pizza I am just not going to order pizza from there any more. Get a better manager Pizza Hut on Sierra and Randall. She will run the business to the ground.</review></record></dataset><record>

I tried the calzone for $5.00, the pasta Alfredo for $5.00 and a large Pizza with 3 toppings for $10.
And it was hot, delicious and very tasty!
Even my 80 yrs.old Mom loved it!

at the beginning everything went well, the young girl was sweet, but when i got home and check my pizza she placed the wrong order. i came back to tell them and the same girl (mind you, she’s the manager named marta ) gave me an attitude as she was placing my new order. worst customer service ! sorry not sorry</Review>

This place was filled with polite staff and the food that I ordered was great! Overall, they did take a while to make my food of 2 pizzas and a box of cinnamon buns. That’s why I rate this place 4/5.< /text>

<Time>1546546981954< /Time><rate>3</rate><text>The pizza was great... The service... Not so much. So I pre-ordered on line about $117 worth of pizza, we're having a party... I went to pick it up and it was ready... Great so far right? I wanted to add some drinks to my order, so I did that, an additional charge so I'm up to $135ish spent. So cool, I got my pizza, my drinks I'm all set. I go to leave and I can't cary it all... But the girl who helped me purchase everything turns and walks away... So I had to juggle 4 two liter sodas and my purse... I had to leave the pizza behind because I couldn't carry it all and come back for it... I don't know if it's a big deal to anyone else... But you spend that amount of money in a pizza store... I would think they would help you out a little... I'm thinking Pappa John's is looking pretty good right now...</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Terrible service order 3 pizzas and only received 1 I called the store and spoke with the manager Nicole and she gave me a credit for $30 for a future order, today I called them to use my credit and they refused to apply the credit on my order. I called back several times and they won't answer my call and when they did they just hung up on me. HORRIBLE SERVICE< /Review>

Spent close to $30 for a carryout. Pouring rain and the carryout parking was full of delivery cars. Had to park about 30 yards away and walk in with my kids.</Review>

<time>1541393807307< /time><rating>1< /rating><Review>(Translated by Google) Terrible service I ordered a pizza and it was insipid, I called to claim and they were already giving me the service of changing it and the person who prepared it answered me later and he began to contradict himself that it was fine When the pizza was raw, discolored and this person took me out of Casillas and I told him that he was going to eat it and it was really raw and the wings were not the ones I asked for and when the cashier arrived, she attacked me saying that they were like that, the bread was white and raw and she told me that if I didn't like it, I should go to Another pizzeria the young woman is called Maria and that the products with which they made the pizzas were not her problems that she will call you. Maybe Carlos, the owner, so that this person would answer my questions and he attacked me saying that I threatened the employee that I was going to throw the pizza in his face, he regretted that we have to go through these types of confrontations because here who maintains that business are us the customers And without us they don't have a job and I never threaten anyone. I hope they take my claim into account. Thank you and you've just lost a favorite customer at the pizza hut. Good morning.

Pésimo servicio ordene una pizza y estaba insípida llame para reclamar y ya estaban dándome el servicio de cambiarmela y me contestó después la persona q la elaboró y empezó a contradecirse q estaba bien Cuand O la pizza estaba cruda descolorida  y esta persona me saco de Casillas y le dige q el se la iva a comer y realmente estaba cruda y las alas no eran las que pedi y al llegar la cajera me agredió diciendo que eran asi el pan estaba blanco y crudo y me dijo q si n o me gustaba que me fuera a otra pizzería la joven se llama Maria y que los productos q con q elaboraban las pizzas no eran sus problemas que le llamará a u. Tal Carlos propietario para q esta persona me contestara mis dudas y me agredio diciendo que yo amenace al empleado en que le iva a aventar la pizza en la cara lamentó q tengamos que pasar estos tipos de enfrentamientos porque aquí quien mantiene ese negocio somos nosotros los clientes y sin nosotros ellos no tienen trabajo y yo nunca amenace a nadie  espero q tomen en cuenta mi reclamo gracias y acaban de perder un cliente favorito de las pizzas hut buen día.</Review>< pics>

I get to eat here a lot since I work close by. I got to say the customer service is always great and they keep the place neat all the time. Rates are reasonable and they serve large portions.< /Review>

Bai Cebu Lechon doesn’t disappoint. Staff is very friendly, lechon is superb. Long wait line during special holidays is a testament on how good their food is!< /text>

<review>My wife pre-ordered 5 lbs of lechon for $75 for christmas eve.  We drove 1.5 hours to this place on christmas eve.  After I walked in to pick the order up they changed the order on me from 5 lbs for $75 to 7 lbs for $105 plus tax.  They asked if that was ok and I said no that I will ask my wife who placed the order.  I go back inside and told them that I wanted ONLY 5 lbs of the lechon.  These said ok.  They ended up giving me 6 lbs of lechon instead of the 5 lbs that I just asked for and charged me $95.  This is bad business,  almost felt like I was robbed.  It was never about the money it was about I asked for one thing at a set price and I get there and it was changed twice on me and I left unhappy and still without the order I asked for.  I will never be back to this business ever again.  The food quality was good but that was all.</review>< Name>

Extremely friendly staff. As soon as we step into the restaurant you are immediately greeted and treated like a regular customer as if you were part of the family. Not only is the customer service amazing the food is great as well. You are provided with a lot of food for the price and it tasted fresh and was still hot. I would recommend this place to everyone.< /text>

Savoring the taste of Cebu’s finest lechon. Brings you back to the Pearl City of the South in the Philippines. You’ll be greeted with cheerful smiles by its owner as they prepare your lechon belly. Just be sure to be early as these pigs go fast! The place is clean and if you suddenly feel singing, a karaoke awaits you there.<//Review>

If you're looking to order lechon, this isn't a bad spot. I read reviews from here and other sites that had me craving this place, while not extraordinary it'll fill the need for lechon!   Before this post is criticized, know that its cebuano lechon should hold more natural flavor especially when dipped in Mong Tomas and this place doesn't fit my criteria for 5 stars.<//Review>

Yes. Just yes.  Their lechon is worth it. Normal lechon has nothing on Lechon Cebu. The same way you don't use A1 steak sauce on good steak,  you won't need the mang tomas for this lechon.
The problem is their hours of operation.  I do not understand how a Filipino restaurant doesn't tailor more to "Filipino time" (island time,  etc).<//text>

<text>One of the best "lechon" in the Bay Area. Ordered a  pound of the pork to go and I have to say it was very flavorful. The pork must have been marinated overnite before cooking. Will definitely be back but not so soon for I have to watch my Cholesterol. Lol<//text>< GmapID>

Best lechon I've ever had in the USA! Very flavorful all the way thru inside unlike your typical lechon where most of the flavor is on the outside. This one does not even need to be dipped in mang tomas sauce as you need to savor the flavor. Yummy!<//Text>

<Review>First time coming to a Lechon style place. As we came in the delicious smell of the roasted pork filed the air. The place is simply decorated with plastic chairs and metal and plastic tables. Walking up to the counter we saw all the offering they had on display. The best of all was the roasted pork laying there in it all it crunchy glory. Mmm yummy!!!
So being my first time I ordered one of each. Well except the blood, yup blood (pig's blood) not to fond of the irony taste of it. Ok, got all of the other items the pork stew, the chicken stew, and the veggies. It came with white steamed rice and noodles. The chicken Stew tasted like chicken adobo and very tasty. The pork stew had a good flavor. ( it looked as they used the leftover pork to make the stew). The best was yet to come. The roasted pork was crispy and the meat soft and tender. The crispy skin had a awesome flavor. Yummy!!! The pork had nice sweet flavor. Mmmm.
Overall this place is delicious if you're in the mood for roasted pork. I will definitely be back again. Enjoy everyone.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Authentic, well-seasoned, done-well, lip-smackin’, saliva-inducing, finger-lickin’ lechon! 🤤😋😋😋</Review>

<username>BwgB G< /username><Review>Just found out about this place. Very happy to see Lechon here in Suisun City. The pork is excellent, crispy crackling and succulent pork. Limited side dishes otherwise I’d give it 5 stars. Definitely would recommend to my friends.< /Review>< Time>

Ordered a pair of cleats for a client of mine who kicks for the Seattle Seawhawks. Great experience! If they do not have the item you are looking for they will help you find it. This is a tough business to be in but they do a great job! keep up the awesome customer service ! Alejandra Gutierrez
is a great employee!<//Review>

Just picked up our shirts and capes custom-branded by the Coliseum for our Halloween costumes and they look AWESOME! Rene and the rest of the staff were so friendly and easy to work with - I'll definitely be back for all my custom shirt needs! Thank you Rene!<//review>

(Translated by Google) Good service to sell but unfulfilled to deliver I bought a shirt on Friday the 16th I left it so they could put a number on it for 30 dollars but they left to talk to me to deliver it on Wednesday the 21st they never spoke I went to ask about it on Friday the 23rd and they hadn't made it They had it ready until next Monday, it was for my son's birthday gift, do not promise without they will not fulfill

Service at this location was amazing. Every time I walk in, I am greeted in a friendly manner by every employee there. Couldn’t thank the manager Bibiana there enough. She made sure we took care of all my needs and was really helpful while doing so. Definitely coming back.</Text>

<text>I’ve been coming here for about 2 years now and received nothing but excellent service. I was helped by Crystal Placencia both years and all I can say is she’s the best. She never rushes us, she’s always double checking and making sure everything is accurate on paper. She even walks us out the door which I really liked. She answers all my questions too, so my family will start coming here from now on as well as myself.</text><Response>None< /Response>< name>

<Date>1486595716839</Date><rate>1< /rate><Review>DO NOT FILE YOUR TAXES HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Zero stars for this place. These so called insurance and tax "specialists" charge unfairly. When you file your taxes they don't tell you how much the fees are up front. They say that the software that they use will not show them how much the fees are so that is why they cannot tell you. They say that you have to wait until after you receive your refund in order to get a print out of the fees, which is ridiculous. If you go to any other establishment to file your taxes they are able to tell you up front how much they charge. I was over charged to file my federal and state taxes with them. I will never file with them ever again. I suggest no one files their taxes here.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

If your thinking about doing your TAXES THERE!! DONT!!! theyre flyer says 29.99 to start but when your tax return is $279 and they DNT TELL YOU UP FRONT THEYRE GOING TO CHARGE YOU $150 TO GET THEM DONE, WELL THAT REALLY ISNT FAIR OR HONEST! so who gets charged 29.99??? Is it the bum on the corner? Or is it the person that gets NO RETURN AT ALL?!!! 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔<//review>

<text>(Translated by Google) My son charged over $ 200 to get his taxes. I would not recommend this place. This was the first time he filed his taxes, they took advantage of him without knowing it, they didn't even tell him how much he was being charged to do everything electronically. It seems that they are taking advantage of all the agricultural work in the Sanger area that they do not know better. Shame on your party tax service.

Cobró mi hijo más de $ 200 para conseguir sus impuestos. Yo no recomendaría este lugar. Esta era la primera vez que archivaba sus impuestos, se aprovechaban de él sin saberlo, ni siquiera le dijeron cuánto se le estaba cobrando que todo se hiciera electrónicamente. Parece que se están aprovechando de todas las labores agrícolas en la zona de Sanger que no saben mejor. Vergüenza en su servicio de impuestos de fiesta.

I had my Chrysler at the Stealership over in Lake Elsinore and they kept it for almost 2 weeks and were not good at following up and charged me almost 2x what Menifee Transmission did for the same work. The Stealership was way to busy and I will not take any vehicle to them ever again if I can help it.  I had it towed and in one day, Menifee Transmission fixed what the Stealership couldn't fix in almost 2 weeks!  I was quoted over $1000 by the Stealership and Menifee Transmission charged just over $650 which is below the average what what I had done to my vehicle when I searched online.   There is reason why Menifee Transmission has a perfect 5 star rating on yelp! Great service and great value!< /review>

I recommend this shop to anyone in need of service from something small to something big, they more then likely can help and if not they will refer you to someone who can. Joe the owner is a great guy and very friendly, and works with your budget if he can.  Great family business. *****</review>

This is a family owned business. Everyone is really nice and very professional. They put a transmission on my 300 Chrysler and did an amazing job. I've been here with other car issues and again they did awesome . Joe the owner is very professional and honest. Rich another employee the same way. I would recommend this place to someone who is having car problems. I'm very grateful to have found an honest place like this. Thank you to everyone there for helping me with my car issues!< /Review>

< Review>
I took my 2010 dodge ram 1500 in for a check engine light diagnostic... The codes were all for sensors needed and I knew that and explained I needed the pressure sensor and torque converter clutch solenoid changed... They told me I needed a new transmission and it would cost 4000.00. If they would have done even a simple check they would have found that symptoms of the transmission issues were clearly caused by the bad sensors. I took my truck to another shop and they diagnosed and changed sensors for 830.00, my truck runs perfectly and the check engine light is off now. The reason why I am posting this is to warn people that might not know any better and would shell out hard earned money for a new transmission just on the word of a unscrupulous mechanic</Review>

We truly pride ourselves on our honesty and our relationships with our customers.

We are sorry you felt the need to leave this review, but we explained the reasoning and were always honest and upfront.  We didn't want to take the chance that it wouldn't work and you would end up needing a new transmission, and there is still a good chance you will need a transmission.

My transmission was having issues.  It was provided by my evil extended warranty company when the first one failed.  Menifee Transmission went to bat for me and got it covered.</review>

<Text>My grandson"s first car, his parents purchased this 2003 350Z dream car for him. I wanted him to have a reliable vehicle.so I told him, bring your car in for full service, being it had 100k miles, that way, he had a base line of service.

Changed:
1. Replaced belts
2. Replaced  and drain power steering fluid
3. Replaced  and drain brake fluids
4. Replaced  transmission fluid
5. Replaced  and flush radiator fluid
6. Replaced  rear end gear oil.

Joe ,was so understanding and helpful he offered to replace the oil pressure sending unit for free, the next time we come in.

It nice to find a business that's HONEST and local, that my grandson can take his car, without being ripped off.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dc9ded084a3d0b:0xce9e3b8162deff2d</gmap_id></record>

The owner is friendly and offers not  only his knowledge but options as well. My vehicle is seventeen years old. It can be a challenge to find parts and solutions for my car, but Joe and his staff always come through! Thanks Menifee Transmission!!<//Text></record>

I came here to have my transmission checked out hoping I would get an honest mechanic that could be upfront about any work my car needs. Well Joe didn't fail me at all. I told him my concerns and he had my car looked at and came back with telling me my car was fine, no well it could be this but it'll cost you talk just the truth and if I had any other concerns to bring it back to have him check it out. That's exactly the kind of guy I would recommend anyone to. I didn't mind paying him the fee to find nothing wrong with my car or settled my nerves and he still was doing his job. Thanks Joe!<//text>

<Response>{'time': 1550865311296, 'text': "We apologize, however, we refused service to you because when you came in your were extremely confrontational and hostile from the very beginning.  It was not a lack of communication or attitude on our side. You walked in and demanded that an excessive amount of work be done on your vehicle in an amount of time that would not have been possible.  When we tried to explain this, you did not want to hear it and continued with your hostility.\nNormally, customers will call and ask for a time window if they need numerous repairs. If they do walk in and we inform them that we cannot get it done within the time window they need, then they will happily set an appointment that works best for their schedule.  Our customers understand that we take our time to make sure all of the work is done properly.\nYou came in and spoke directly with the owner and instead of understanding that auto repair takes time for quality and safe work, you began to degrade and speak horribly.  We have worked on your husband's car numerous times and have always helped him out to the best of our ability because of financial issues.  We did not deserve to be treated to or spoken to the way you did.  We kindly ask that you and your husband no longer bring your vehicles to our facility.  We will not be verbally abused and attacked simply because we do not rush our work."}< /Response>< pictures>

<Text>Didn't get work on car done there. Total lack of communication. They insisted we didn't call first. We did. Of the three conversations with them. They never thought to mention that they booked up for no less than a week. Not until the discussion about them saying we didn't call about bringing the car in. Then the attitude showed up. In response to this post I was reamed. They turned everything around so they looked as if their halo was bright and shiny. Whatever business they did in the past with my husband had nothing to do with me. I was not hostile I was irritated. When we came in the office I saw no friendly faces with smiles. I got attitude the moment I walked in the door. I was dealing with a situation that arose between the shop and my husband. They were rude and downright hostile. I would not take a plastic bag for them to work on. How do you keep customers with that Sanctimonious attitude?

I always wanted to respond to your post.
Though I decided that arguing online wasn't going to fix anything.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I had my brakes and oil change done here this weekend and I could not be happier.  Everyone is honest and so nice.  They provided me with recommendations, but never made me feel pressured to have it done the same day.  They said it could be done in the next few months, but there was no rush.  I didn't feel ripped off or duped when I left.  I look forward to returning with my other vehicles.</Review>

<Text>I went into the shop to get the service records on a car I bought. I was told all records were wiped clean in November 2017 by accident.  Next I went on carfax, guess what- Menifee Transmission never reports to car fax.  How do you not spend  $20 on a flash drive to keep a copy of your records safe? Find a shop with better business practices.< /Text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1549069078331, 'text': "Unfortunately, our hard drive was wiped and we have since made changes to ensure it doesn't happen again, and it is not as simple and cheap as a $20 flash drive, our database is much more complicated then that.  However, I would like to mention that auto repair shops have never been required to report to Carfax.  From a quick look at Carfax's website it seems that auto repair facilities can pay a premium to Carfax and become an authorized shop, these shops more then likely, report the maintenance.  Reporting to Carfax is not required or mandatory, it is only an advertising option for auto repair facilities to get exposure and customers.  I would also like to add, when buying a used vehicle you should request copies of all service records from the seller and if they cannot provide them then you ask them to obtain such records prior to the purchase.  Used vehicles are normally buyer beware and sold as is. Also, even if our system had not been damaged, we would not have provided those records to you unless we had permission from the individual who owned the car previously, otherwise it is a violation of privacy.  I hope you have a good day."}<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I had a simple oil change service. When I went back home I found most of the oil was spelled on my garage floor. Went back next day with new oil and talked with Joe. He add 2 more quarters of oil and refuse to refund me for the purchased I made. He cursed me and kicked me out of his business. I filed a complain against his shop. so soon he will be out of business. All these good reviews you read from his family and friends.

Yes, you were kicked out of our shop because you continued to attack the owner.  You have simply copy and pasted all of your reviews and then scoured internet to post them where ever you can.

{'time': 1549419594866, 'text': "1st: 2 days ago was Sunday 2/3/2019, Superbowl Sunday, and we were CLOSED that day!\n2nd: We would never intentionally hang up on a customer! If you called during our usual business hours and we got disconnected it was completely unintentional. Did you even try to call again thinking maybe we got disconnected on accident or did you just run to google to leave a bad review?  We are trying earn an honest living to support our family and the families of our employees just like everyone else in this country.  It is very disheartening to have someone like you leave a review for something so petty or something that didn't even really happen."}<//Response>

Slow, need more people working there. They where out of all the breads, half the soda machines were out. This would not be bad if the sandwich was good, but it was horrible.</review>

Couldn’t recommend more. As a student of the nearby boarding school, this sandwich shop is not only the closest, but it is the greatest in the area. Outstanding customer service, the employees are some of the nicest people I’ve ever met. The sandwiches have amazing value, and are incredibly delicious.</Text>

the wait in the waiting room  was excessive, with insufficient sanitized chairs. i had to stand so some time before a chair was available. however, Dr Brad Johnson made the waiting worthwhile. He is patient, thorough, thoughtful and kind. Every appointment with him has been a good experience with a review of the X-rays and a thoughtful reaction n to symptoms.<//Review>

<text>I was recently seen by Dr. George Tang for left hip pain. I appreciated his thoroughness and felt very comfortable in our discussion. I liked that when he suggested xrays, that he took film for both hips (not just the one generating discomfort), my knees and spine. I felt this to be important because perhaps what I was experiencing, could possibly be an effect of another area of my body in decline. I had previously (different orthopaedic group) been diagnosed with arthritis/ osteoarthritis and beginning signs of osteoarthritis. What I most wanted was to hear that I may have options other than hip replacement; and that's what I needed. If ultimately, after exploring these other options, it turns out that surgery is needed, then I'd feel comfortable with going forward. Maybe?😏
Dr. Tang is exceptional!<//text><gmap_id>0x80c2c37d97f410e3:0x42c828b63c07f758< /gmap_id>< pictures>

I absolutely love Dr Panossian. His bedside manners are of compassion and always willing to help you in anyway he can. He is professional and dedicated to his patients. I have been under his care for over ten years. I highly recommend him and his staff.< /review>

Have had great results from prior help from Dr Jo and his colleagues on the physical therapy side. The most recent visit (for a different issue) was very good too.  Less waiting time and Dr Jo very direct and efficient as before. Appreciate that he recommends surgery only as a last resort.</text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>Wow! The experience I had with Dr. Borenstein was amazing. He cares a lot for his patients and attends them as fast as he can. Not only could he answer all my questions but his team was also on top of their game. They wanted to make sure my surgery went as smooth as possible and had me take scans and lab test to make sure everything was okay. I would definitely recommend Dr. Borenstein to anyone who want to meet up with an orthopedic doctor.< /text></record></dataset><record>

DO NOT GO THERE! I understand it’s a strong statement but here’s the reason to back it up. I took my 73 years old mother there 3 times and Dr.George Tang did not see her but sent a new assistant to see her, diagnosed and gave her a cortisone shot. The assistant gave wrong Information about the treatments and forgot about her case as it was obvious she didn’t take note. When we corrected her, her excuse was “I’m new here” I have filed a formal complaint to the medical board of California for further inspection if it is legit for the doctor to make appointment but has never shown up.<//text>

Had appointment at 2pm! It’s not 2:30 and barely got finished with them checking me in! I also heard about 3 other patients who arrived for THE SAME DOCTOR!?!? What?? Unorganized and overbooked with very long wait times’ the staff at the desk are friendly but I mean come on.....I am about to see dr Rizvi which I’m looking forward too because he’s got a great rep!< /Review>

I also see how great he is to his staff, respectful, humorous, and kind.  His relaxed attitude makes me,  feel comfortable, and I feel confident. and comfortable being in his care.  He takes the time to explain all he's doing and what would possibly follow if there is necessary, continued treatment.  His staff, specifically, David, always makes it a pleasure to be ushered into Dr.Borenstins office. He too is pleasant, kind, and humorous .  The entire staff is hardworking and dedicated, and I can't say this enough, kind and decent.<//text>< response>

Was told there are two procedures that could help and I opted for one-a cortisone injection.  But his assistant Crystal can't figure out how to submit this to Blue Cross Blue Shield.  She gave me a reference number but Blue Cross told me she backed out of the que system prompts too soon.  I offered to pay for the epidural/injection MYSELF, a $1,400 cost for the procedure and they weren't interested.  They didn't want my money.  So, I went elsewhere and am glad I did. This place has a problem.  And by the way, the office manager, Joe, called me at work to scold me for being a problem.

Dr. Jo, Mona, and the entire staff here are so wonderful and lovely! Super supportive, professional, and personable. Took a fairly traumatic experience and made it as painless as possible. I would not be walking again if it wasn’t for this great medical group. Highly recommend! If I was gonna break my ankle again, I wouldn’t want anybody else taking care of it ❤️<//Review>

Place is clean, friendly, and the wait time is short.  I was referred here for an injury that was not detected by a regular MRI machine.  I had the imaging done again with their office and they were able to see what was causing my pain.  The doctor talks fast, moves quick, but works great with his patients.  The doctor is knowledgeable and confident in his experience, therefore I am not worried about his abilities to perform surgery.</text>

Our son is an athlete and he has had countless run ins with Orthopedic doctors.

<review>Good experience and great orthopedic, Dr. Todd Borenstein.  He was the best but I was a cash paying patient  n need of a cortisone injection. The cost $250.  I passed.  Maybe the hospital fee's needs adjusting to both the insurances and us, cash paying patients.

Very nice and clean reception room.  The chairs were marked visible so patients sit apart according to COVID-19 guidelines.  The reception staff, and Doctors assistances were all very friendly and professional.  Dr. Borenstein was very nice and explained my condition very clearly to me. I was in pain but friendly Doctor and staff helped me get through the exam well.<//text>

<Text>I had tried EVERYTHING to relieve my back pain before coming to Dr. Burnham at Huntington Orthopedics. Chiropractor, Epidurals, Acupuncture etc...none of it relieved my  back pain for more than a short time. Dr. Burnham performed a lumbar fusion on my L5-S1 and I FINALLY have relief! The staff, especially Dr Burham’s right arm, Julie, are exceptional, I have been very happy! Also, Huntington Orthopedics has another group that does physical therapy and the care there is just as professional! I highly recommend Huntington Orthopedics!</Text>< Date>

Dr Borenstein was kind, informative and helpful to give me advice and course of potential treatment to my ailments. They are fractured right ankle many years ago and the pain from walking or weight bearing that I have to live with. First step is try injection to see if it can manage the pain before other approaches.

He also reviewed my MRI on my right knee that was injured from skiing last winter. More testing and evaluation needed to determine if I want to go thru ACl surgery to improve the quality of actively.

Thanks again Dr Borenstein. Look forward to see you at the next appointment

Excellent physician who does his utmost to treat the problems one is experiencing by addressing all of the underlying conditions as opposed to only focusing on the most simplistic of solutions.  His nursing staff along with his associate, Dr. Rodriguez are also highly professional and instrumental in addressing the patient’s best interests for recovery.</Text>

I had made an appointment to see the DOCTOR and I was under the impression that that was whom I was going to see, but instead I was seen by his assistants. I was never told that that's who I was going to see until the assistant walked in. It was seriously a waste of time. The guy just made me walk on my toes and mu heels. Then he was about to diagnose me with a condition and I said, "No, I just got tested for that and out came out negative. He then stepped outside and I could hear him talk to another assistant saying, "just give her medicine for it. Is there any?" So then they BOTH walked in and told me nothing I did not already know. If I make an appointment with a DOCTOR, I want to see the DOCTOR. Thats whom I was authorized to see , thats whom I want to see.</Text>

<review>In second waiting room the entire staff at the front desk do NOT wear mask! Why in the world do they take our temperature if they are not going to protect themselves? I can't believe the improper treatment of the front desk person in 2nd waiting room. None of them wear masks! I asked them at least 3 times to wear a mask and they completely ignored me. The guy with the long beard is very rude. He just walks away.  They dont care about the patient safety. I love the doctors here and Dr. Assistants as well. They are great. Too bad they have such a terrible sraff! This is unacceptable and not a professional establishment anymore. The staff is completely ignorant to the virus or patients health.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Not only is the staff great in his office but the surgery team and the physical therapy team are all top notch. As someone who has had arthritis for 45 years (since childhood) I’ve been around a ton of Dr’s and PT programs. This team is best of the best. I will actually miss the PT team once I’ve finished my rehab.<//Review>< Pics>

My appointment was at 2:15pm. Showed up around 2:05, signed in by 2:10pm. It's currently 3:30pm, transferred to three different waiting areas, and still haven't been seen. They make sure to collect your co-pay right away, though. Wild.<//Review>

<review>Some staff is rude. If they can't answer questions about surgery, they say they don't know and you can call the surgery center and ask. We tried. Can't connect with anyone at the center cuz the dr isn't listed with them. It's making us nervous. When I informed the Dr's staff about it and asked for help, the staff member gave me the frozen face smile and just kept saying she didn't know and couldn't answer. When I suggested she take this feedback to a manager, she just got more defensive, even though my questions were not personal criticisms aimed at her. This was not helpful and then made us feel all around uncomfortable. The surgeon has a good bedside manner and good reviews so we are hopeful. But dont expect much more than a welcome from staff.< /review><Rate>2<//Rate><Resp>{'time': 1581121241560, 'text': 'Hi Nancy, that is absolutely unacceptable and I will address this issues.

< Review>
I have been coming here for over a year. Dr. Rizvi and his assistants are always pleasant to interact with. Recently they have moved to a new office across the street from their old one. It’s spacious and beautiful inside. My only gripe is with the wait time. I can’t really complain because coming from a busy practice as well, I understand the unforeseen occurs. My usual wait times are usually 1-2 hrs. But I’ve waited like 3 hrs or something like that before too, but didn’t really notice since I took a nap because my appointment was after work. I normally bring homework or something to occupy myself with during the wait.</Review>

Today we sat through a 45- minute appointment only to be seen for 10 minutes, as the rest of the time they were seeing other patients and instead assistants were just giving me random exercises to do. We have also been there multiple times and each time we get a new doctor, so each time the new doctor spends time reading the chart and has no idea what they are doing! Go somewhere else, as this place isn’t worth your co-pay.<//Review>

Following a torn Achilles tendon, I visited Dr. James Reid at Huntington Orthopedics.  Dr. Reid is good, but Huntington Orthopedics is terrible.  This reflects badly on Dr. Reid.  The main problem with his clinic is that they routinely overbook patients, and don’t hire a qualified staff to handle the patient load.

Over the course of one year, I visited this office six times.  Every time, I waited a minimum of 30 minutes past my appointment time before my name was called.  Then, a nurse would take me into the examination room, where I would wait another 20 minutes before the doctor actually showed up.

Dr. Reid himself is friendly and knowledgeable.  I am satisfied with the surgery he performed on my leg.  However, the visits to his clinic were always frustrating.  The front desk staff was usually overworked and impatient.  The nurses were unable to answer basic questions.  They did not seem properly trained in removing stitches or fitting orthopedic boots.  When I called the office, it was impossible to reach Dr. Read or his medical assistant.  When I left a message, I rarely received a prompt call-back.  If I had to do it over again, I would not go to Huntington Orthopedics.< /Review>

Very busy place, but friendly attentive staff assist in your needs, and gets you to a patient room for your doctors visit. Dr. Reid was friendly and explains in easy to understand language so you're informed of procedures.
Highly Recommended!<//review>

<Text>This Dr Office at Hunington Orthopedics address at 10 Congress St. Suite 103 Pasadena Ca. Is a very unprofessional office! I been in pain for months in my right knee! I finally got an authorization letter from my primary doctor to see Vahe R. Panossian, MD. My appointment was for February 195th 2019 at 9:45am. I had make it for this time after I drop my son off to school and before I pick him up! I'm in the office filling out my paper work in even done before the receptionist called and apologizes because the Dr wants to leave and if I can come back at 22pm... WOW is what I said! Her disappointing The Dr. Panossian is Unprofessional indeed! Please thing twice before coming to this Office at 10 Congress St. And FYI I'm still in Pain! What a Dr. ...? Thank you very much for nothing Dr Panossian! 😞 Not to mention... Pasadena is about 22 miles from the West Covina area! Terrible! A waste of time and gas and my poor car! But these Doctor's like Dr. Panossian really don't care! And them Goofy nurses and receptionist apologizing for the Dr you can tell they dont mean it.. It's a shame! Really it is! Sad!<//Text>< Pics>

I advised that I had gone to patient portal and completed all pre visit paperwork. Still asked to come in early.  I arrived at 12:30, just a few people in waiting area,  which shortly got very crowded.

After more than 1 hour, they called me back to wait for xrays.   I waited, and waited, and waited.  New patients came back and got xrays.  I asked and was told it went by when the xray orders were entered??

After 1.5 hours, with nothing happening, I asked for my copay back so I could leave and pay my $6 parking fee. Can't comment on Dr Reid's abilities, since never got to meet him.  Would not recommend this "Cattle Call" doctors office.</Text><userid>100297078392629220539</userid><name>Alice McCann</name><rate>1<//rate>< pictures>

< Review>
A little over a week ago I hit an obstacle in the road with my bicycle and it threw me into the middle of the road but fortunately there were no cars coming.  There was a significant amount of pain but since I was traveling to the East Coast the next day I figured I could tough it out.

Upon my return my primary physician referred me to two orthopedic specialist.  The first one is in office and only works about three hours a day the second one, the subject of this review, told me they could get me and maybe Tuesday afternoon.

I was always taught that the first rule of medicine for a physician was to no harm.  Obviously this clown was asleep during that part of his education.  In his office staff is still a coma.

I would avoid this hack like the plague!<//Review>

I've been seeing Dr. Rizvi for years, and he's great with me. The front desk, on the other hand, can use a serious attitude adjustment. I get it that you're swamped Friday mornings, but when I go up to the desk asking if you've called my name yet, and the receptionist barks, "No, we haven't!" before even knowing my name, that's not good customer service. Maybe this off shouldn't take more patients than it can handle< /Review>

We experienced a clogged mainline Friday evening. I called a well-known rooter service to make an appointment for Saturday morning. They scheduled a technician between 9 AM and 11 AM. We received a call at 10:30 to advise us our technician would be just a little late. At 12:30, frustrated, I called and canceled the appointment.
I googled drain cleaning and Aces Rooter came up. I called and spoke with Mike, he advised that he could come right away and arrived at our house within 30 minutes. The clog was cleared and we were back in business within an hour and for $40.00 less than the “Well Known” service.
We found Mike to be professional ,knowledgeable and courteous!
We commend him to you!

<text>Mike was great! Not only was he responsive, he showed up timely and at the last minute too! No appointment needed! He was friendly, honest, worked quickly, and reasonably priced. We had a leaking toilet that we shut off & couldn’t use. Mike came over nearly right away, fixed the leak by replacing old, damaged parts, unclogged the line from “flushable” wipes & now the toilet’s working great! He even took the time to walk through the rest of the house to check things out. He provided estimates on things he found so we know what’s needing to be handled next. We’ll definitely be using Ace’s Rooter going forward! Highly recommend! Bye-bye to the unavailable, overcharging plumbing company we’ve been using for years! Thanks Mike! 🌟💯<//text>< pictures>

Mike to the rescue again... kitchen sink this time.... and I will it again.... Mike is a straight forward guy and will not give you round around the bush. The other company will advertise low price but it is a switch and bait with no warranty unlike ACE'S... Five star on this transaction!!!<//text>

Mike has been to our place a few times to fix plumbing issues that pop up for any home owner. He's always been a professional taking care of any of our problems, timely and prompt, and polite, great around the kids and the dogs. Appreciate having a local plumber I can always count on. Couldn't recommend him enough.<//review>

It's hard to find an honest plumber, Mike went above and beyond for us. We have an older house and were having issues with our kitchen sink & bathroom sinks not draining. He came out and explained to us what the problem was, gave us his price & we were very pleasantly surprised! I highly recommend Aces Rooter plumbing<//Review>

<Text>I needed some work done and being a girl I felt nervous and like they were going to over charge and take advantage me so I got a few opinions and Ace pluming was on the list and over the phone I was still worried and I think they could hear the tremble in my voice and he just reassured me that everything was going to be fine and he was going to take care of me and give me the best quote, he said how else can he run a business if he was untrustworthy? He wanted me to feel comfortable and satisfied with the job so if anything went wrong in the future that I would be a returning client or recommend his business... when he came out he automatically treated me like a friend not a client he thoroughly explained the situation and what needed to be done and I didn’t only pick Aces pluming because of the price but because of how genuine he was I felt I was making the right decision which I did! Thank you Mike for helping me out and I’m recommending his business! P.S I had someone come check his work after just to make sure and they commented on the great work done</Text>< Pictures>

<review>If it were possible to give Mike a 10-star rating, I would. He underpromised and overdelivered, showing up well before he was expected. An expected kitchen faucet replacement turned into a complete replacement of the drain and he took care of it quickly and professionally. The house we're working on is quite old, so I know we will be calling Mike for more work in the future.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Review>I have been bringing my dog to Seven HIlls for 14 years. First, he has lived 14 happy, healthy years. Thanks Seven Hills. From the front desk to the doctors in the back, everyone is kind and knowledgeable. Doctor Thompkins takes time to answer all of my questions and give me all of the information I need to make decisions about my dog's health.<//Review>< pictures>

We went here to get an international health certificate for our pet. They are very organized and super kind. They asked me to send them details before hand so that they could have all the details on their side. I was out of the country and my friend was taking my pet and co-ordinating this was so easy while in the contrary you would think it would be complicated given that I was not there in person They needed to do an electronic international health certificate and they even went the extra mile to give us the confirmation number, contact USDA to ensure everything went smoothly. Alex was constantly in touch and sent me several emails, voicemails and always got back to me. We truly appreciate everything they did to help us get our pup back home ❤️<//Text>

This vet routinely over vaccinates in an attempt to maximize their profits, they also try to schedule two and three follow-up visits to stretch out how much they can soak you for. Sandy H. has a rude and dismissive attitude if you don't immediately take everything she says as gospel. Even humans get second opinions for their doctors.< /text>

We just switched to this vet and so far we are very happy. Our dog had her annual exam here and they were very thorough and thoughtful at the appointment. We were able to get an appointment quickly and also follow up vet tech appointments. They have flea collars and medications available at the same price as available online. It was so nice to be at a vet where you get personal attention. It’s also a convenient location with easy parking.< /Review>

Seven Hills Veterinary Hospital has provided exceptional compassionate care for all the animals in my family. Dr. Sandy Hazanow is deeply thoughtful, present, and available in her practice. Her love and respect for the animals and humans she serves, as well as the joy she has for her work is apparent. I have had many difficult choices to make for the animals in my family, including end of life care, and have  especially appreciated Dr. Hazanow's ability to offer advice, informed options, and heartfelt guidance without shame, pressure, or false urgency. I have always felt authentically heard and supported by her, welcomed to ask questions and take my time, and impressed by her willingness to go above and beyond. It is rare to find a veterinary practice that so fully meets the needs of both myself and my animals, and I fully trust my animals in Dr. Hazanow's care.<//review>

Clean. Friendly. Welcoming. Helpful. I won't go anywhere else.

I took my cat to Dr. Whitaker about an allergy. He was absolutely amazing. He spend time answering my questions and laid out a staged treatment approach with Plan A and Plan B. The front desk staff and clinic are also very welcoming.

I had previously been to another vet (in the Mission) that didn't seem as clean. At this other vet, the exam rooms were loud (with dogs pacing outside) and my cat was on edge the entire time. Sever Hills was the exact opposite.</text>

prompt, courteous, professional, compassionate service.  A neighborhood gem.

post script September 2015:

One of my elderly cats had to have many of her teeth removed.  The staff here make the process as easy as possible.   and they obviously care dearly about their patients.

In the past I have taken other pets there, including a guinea pit who needed to be euthanized.  Staff was always compassionate.<//review>

<text>OMG! I would NEVER take my pet (cat) here. I went to the office for a simple food purchase. BIG mistake! They don't know how to use their computer system for billing.The front desk person is clueless. (I'll cut her some slack because she was probably new.) The person in charge was equally clueless...and THAT'S not OK. It required bank intervention. My cat is not a patient at this practice and never will be. If this is how the front office works imagine how bad things would be if/when you pass through to the back office. (Clinical Care Area) And that's where the bank cannot intervene. Scary place.< /text>< Name>

< Review>
The vets were knowledgeable and very thorough in their examination of some skin sores my cat had. They provided me with an estimate and explained the tests they recommended. The prices seemed reasonable, especially when compared to other vets in San Francisco. The staff, both in the front and the techs and vets, were very nice, and everyone handled my cat very well. I would recommend them to my friends and definitely expect to return.<//Review>

Affordable, convenient, pet-loving, trustworthy, well-managed - this vet office has it all. We love Seven Hills. They have kept our cat Buster happy and healthy for five years, which isn't easy because he has asthma, bad teeth, and he is food obsessed = fatty. We love our cat beyond and are so grateful to have the good hearted folks at Seven Hills be part of our family.</Review>

These are people who love and care for your animal.  That said, I feel that they are much more interested in finding the cause of your pet's ailment than just treating the symptoms.  This may be what you are looking for- and if so these are the best people for the job.

However, if you are more interested in making your animal immediately comfortable and not spending a lot of money on diagnostics to discover the root cause of these problems, you may find yourself fighting a bit of an uphill battle.</Text>

Brought both of my dogs in for their annual check up and vaccinations for the first time to 7 Hills. My previous vet had retired and 7 Hills was recommended.  Staff was very considerate and I had an appointment within two days.  All work was done professionally.  7 Hill will be my go to vet hospital for the future.< /text>

The doctors and staff at Seven Hills Veterinary Hospital are very helpful and compassionate.  My very first time there was with an older cat that I had that was very sick.  The staff was up front with me about the options available and the likely outcomes.  I really appreciated the honesty and compassion that they provided.  I have  a younger cat now and there is no place else that I would take her in the bay area for veterinary care.< /Text>

<Review>I can't say enough great things about Seven Hills and their Veterinarians. You can tell that they love animals and want to keep them healthy and happy. I was really worried when I moved to SF with my 15 year old cat that was sick with cancer, but after going to Seven Hills I was so glad that I did move to SF, they really helped with his care and keeping him comfortable. And when it was time for him to go to kitty heaven Dr. Hazanow made a house call so that I didn't have to take him out of the house and stress him out before it was time. I appreciated that so much. I now have 2 cats that are 3 and wouldn't take them anywhere else. The staff and vets at Seven Hills are really great and you know that they really care. I've recommended them to other pet owners, and they love them too.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Dr. Hazanow is awesome and the staff are all super friendly and helpful! We were recommended to go here when our dog developed back issues and they were so helpful and kind with treating him both in the short and long term. Extremely thorough and genuinely concerned about our pet's well-being. I hope I never have to go anywhere else!</review>

Went to purchase flea meds for my dog and was refused service by Cindy. She told me the establishment could not accept any new pets for the rest of the year. I explained that nothing was wrong with my dog and that I just wanted to purchase flea meds but was still refused service. According to Cindy, they are overwhelmed(I was the only customer) and it was not possible for me to purchase the medication. This is a shame because this is the closest vet to my apartment. I hope their reception improves and I will keep this rating at 1 star until my experience with this business changes.< /review>

<date>1444073007662<//date><rate>5<//rate><Review>I've been taking my cat to 7 Hills for awhile now. I've seen 3 of the vets and liked the care each of them provided. They each spent all the time I needed to find out the range of possible etiologies for a weird fur/skin condition. I liked that they started with conservative treatment including omegas. The front desk staff is super helpful - gave me a sample of food to try before I bought a bag. When I needed reassurance they gave it to me without making me feel like a wuss. Easy parking. Check out 7 Hills!< /Review>< pictures>

Fantastic people to care for you pooch. We see doctor Taylor who is wonderful. Honestly, one of the Vet Techs really messed a procedure up for us, but I'd still give them 5 stars over any other Vet in the city (and we have been to a few.)<//text>

Seven Hills treated my 15 year-old Lhasa Apso and my Lhasa puppy both splendidly.  From the receptionists to the vets, care is professional, wait time is minimal, and they are easy about scheduling.  The vets know what they are doing,  and are trustworthy.  Rates are about the same as the SPCA.<//text>

I am new to San Francisco and have been very happy with Dr. Whitaker at 7 hills. Dr. Whitaker is always very thorough, spends a lot of time with the dog and owner, and explains things clearly. Wait times are short to none, too, they're open evening and I think they have some Saturday appointments, so it's convenient for those of us who work during the weekdays.< /text>

<Text>We've been taking our dog to Seven Hills since we moved to San Francisco last summer, and they've done a great job caring for him. Their services were highly recommended by the dog walker we work with and we were not disappointed by the vets and staff at Seven Hill.

< Review>
Our cat and dog both love Seven Hills Veterinary Hospital. Satu (our dog) is friends with all three vets and is very happy to go through the door! His teeth are better than ever now that Dr Hazanow sorted them out; bad breath is a thing of the past! There is a high standard of veterinary care and everyone there has a genuine love of animals. I would highly recommend this veterinary clinic.<//Review>

Our pets are a part of our family and she understands our feelings for them.  Her recommendations allow for both the feelings and economics of pet care.

I would highly recommend Dr. Knoble and Seven Hills Vet Hospital<//text>< Name>

Love Seven Hills Vet!! They are super professional, knowledgable and friendly… going the extra mile e.g. automated vaccination reminders for your pup. Also appreciate that they are happy to communicate via email. Location is also easy, with less traffic and guaranteed parking in the Diamond Heights shopping area. Highly recommended!!<//Text>

Dr. Hazanow is great.  She really cares about my babies!  I think this is the absolute best Vet in the area.  It's easy to get to from the city and has plenty of parking. And you can run your errands at the same time because they are right next to Safeway and Walgreens.</Review>

Dr. Knoble spent a significant amount of time with me and my eldercat's exam, despite her heavy work load that day. She is intelligent, kind, clearly keeps up with advances in veterinary medicine and has a great sense of humor! She is very honest about costs and treatment options, and potential outcomes.

I had negative experiences with the previous owners years ago when it was "Glen Canyon Animal Hospital" and am so glad I returned. Having a vet clinic with convenient parking is a dream come true.</Review>

<text>Riley has had a very rough start,  he's a 6 month old mini Australian shepherd. Since we brought him into our family he has had nothing but health problems, everything from a cough to allergies to seizures. We have been to around 4 different others vets who would just push hard medication onto Riley that they weren't even sure would work as well as not even taking the time to ask questions about what we wanted or taking the chance to look into his history. That all changed once we took Riley to Seven Hills. The moment we got there we were greeted with smiles, and once we got into the room we knew we found a diamond in a pile of rocks. His vet treated him as an individual instead of "just another dog", going over every single one of his problems with me, thinking deeply about the possible causes and laying out a plan for the future. It's the first time I've felt someone actually cared about Riley and the struggles we've been going trough with him. If you want a vet that actually cares about the well being of your furbaby instead of just taking your money I highly recommend Seven Hills!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><time>1447347308318< /time>< Rating>

Seven Hills have taken care of my boy Murphy for years now. He's a Golden with most of the typical problems that Goldens have, and the staff at Seven Hills have been great at dealing with them. They're great - they tell me what's going on, what to expect, and make sure we understand the issues and what to do and not do. All of that is great, but it's the little things that make a difference. For instance, when Murph had surgery, they called with updates because they knew we were worried. The staff have all gotten to know him, and when he greets them and asks for a belly rub, they indulge him. That kind of sincerity goes a long way. They're good people and good at what they do. I can't recommend them strongly enough.</Text>

In each case she gave me several treatment options, and helped me understand how each would help, and how much it would cost.  When one was too sick, she helped me through the decision of when to euthanize - and came to my house to make the transition as easy as possible for my family.  Seven Hills Vets is caring, and careful with our pets.  My dogs may not love visiting the vet, but I do.<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Text>Absolutely the best veterinarians in San Francisco.  Sandy Hazinow and Constance Noble are outstanding.  My dog Dram has been cared for by Dr. Hazinow for 14 years, through puppy age to sr. dog.  Now as we face the sunset of his years, the care and compassion by everyone at Seven Hills is unmatched.

<text>We have seen all the veterinarians here and each has their very special way of taking care of my furbabies. They have seen me when I have had to do the most difficult decision of saying goodbye and cared not just for my babies but made sure I was okay. Thank you Seven Hills.< /text><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Daisy's local vet, and a fantastic bunch of people.  Not my local, by any stretch, but worth the travel to get to.< /text>

< Review>
Of the many vets I have worked with, Dr. Hazanow ranks at the very top. She helped us care for Aidan, our Irish Setter dog, in his elder years. He enjoyed a long life for his breed, but the last couple of years was tough, as he developed bladder disease and complications. Dr. Hazanow provided empathic problem-solving care that was clinically competent and highly attuned to both Aidan's needs and our needs as his caregivers. Never were we rushed through an appointment. Charges are reasonable and I never felt that anything being recommended--procedures, medications, or other care products--had any taint of profit motive. Indeed, Dr. Hazanow several times suggested cost-effective solutions available from the drugstore or the supermarket. When she was not available, Drs. Knobel and Whitaker could also be relied on to provide excellent patient and family centered care, and the support staff were competent and very helpful. A couple minor front desk problems I experienced could have happened anywhere and the staff were apologetic and quick to fix them. Seven Hills is a veterinary practice and facility where you and your family can expect high quality, respectful client-centered services and supports for your pet.< /Review>

Both are extremely knowledgeable and caring.  The reception staff and vet techs are also wonderful.  I can honestly say that Dr. Hazanow saved my cocker spaniel twice from near death health issues and was great at diagnosing the problem.    Recently she helped with some dental surgery on my near 16 year old cocker mix and all is going well.  I highly recommend Seven Hills.</Text><Time>1428011675363<//Time></record>

Been taking my dog here since moving to SF and while they do great work I find them to be more expensive than most vets in the area, and they price their supplies above list price which is a bit annoying as I'd rather give them the business but have a hard time paying more than manufacturer suggested price.<//review>

Very impressed!  Excellent service! Employees attentive and friendly, helpful, affordable and clean.  Turned a negative situation Into a positive experience.

The only place to come to in Sacramento. I’ve had work done here twice the most recent being a new set of wheels and tires which I was very particular about. Moe didn’t have them on stock but he was able to order them and have them there a couple days later. My truck also needed a leveling kit and new front shocks to accommodate the new bigger setup. Everything went smooth and looks great! I’d highly reccomend this place< /review>

Worst family run shop. They sold us four really expensive tires that were an inadequate size for our truck, 4 months later we experienced a blowout due to a road hazard, so we went back to only get treated like scum...literally! They staff refused to let us speak to the Owner, in fact they wouldn't even give us his first name because they said it was private information?? Seriously? When does a Business Owners first name become private information? In fact, the owner hid from us. WOW.  We soon after found out from the tire manufacture that whatever manufacture warranty we had was automatically voided due to the fact that the shop sold us wrong size tires, that didn't meet the truck weight capacity. Are you serious?? This shop claims to be a reputable company? What is reputable about this. You might save a buck here but it will cost you more down the line. No more Mom & Pop shop for us. We'll stick with American shops that hold integrity and will stand behind it.</Review>

<text>We have been taken advantage of at other smaller shops before so we were nervous to say the least, to come here. All we needed was a single used tire, and instead of just installing it and sending us off, the gentleman assessed all of our tires and let us know the dangers of driving on different sizes etc. and took the time to question our whole situation. He switched them around accordingly to give us the safest operation possible, as well as gave us a deal on a 2nd tire as they noticed one was on it's way out (starting to shred). This place cares about the condition of your car when it leaves. They care about the client and service they put forth. They are definitely worth a shot if you've never gone here.

<Text>THIS IS THE BEST DEAL IN TOWN. THEY WORK FAST AND THE PRICES ARE BETTER THAN ANY PLACE I'VE CHECKED (AND I CHECKED ALOT).

I LOOKED FOR TIRES AT BIG O AND THEY THAT MY MOTOR MOUNT WAS BROKEN, PLUS 4 TIRES WOULD BE $1300.00. I WENT TO S & S TIRES AND TALKED TO "MO" HIS PRICE WAS $380.00 FOR NEW GOODYEAR TIRES AND THEY CHECKED MY MOTOR MOUNTS AND THEY
WERE FINE. (IMAGINE THAT) BEST SERVICE....BEST PEOPLE...FAST...
I WILL HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE AND WILL NOT GO ANYWHERE ELSE.   THANK YOU  "MO" AND THE GUYS AT S&S TIRES<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

These guys were great. I blew a tire (have a blown spare as well) at about 1530. Had to wait until ten minutes prior to closing (1730) for the tow truck to show up.  They were friendly and willing to wait past closing to help me out, and I wasn't there too long.<//Review>

The best tire shop in Northern California!! Every time I need tires Moe always gives me the best deals. Nicest most humble guy I know always offering cold water and sodas to customers and sometimes even ice cream on hot days haha. it may not be the biggest or fanciest shop but you cannot beat S&S Tires Customer service 👍</Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Grade A service. Rolled into the shop on a donut after the dealership said $400 minimum for a tire replacement (that's under warranty.) It was $95 total out the door within 10 minutes. Went back the next day cause the tire pressure on another wheel looked low and they filled them up without a second thought for free.

Good people, good service and no waiting. They're rad.< /Text>< Pics>

Moe is the man!! Was referred to s&s tire shop by my brother in law. Purchased 4 new tires and all new shocks for my truck. They had problems with getting right shocks, so Moe fixed the problem with a shock upgrade at no extra cost. Very busy shop however someone was very quick to help me as soon as I pulled up and took their time to make sure I was satisfied and helped in anyway possible! Moe and his crew rock I recommend anyone in need of tires, rims and or any suspension needs to check these guys out. Thanks again guys!</Review>

S and S tires has been the only place for me to get tires for the last few years. No other place can beat there prices. The owner Moe is a great help and works with everyone to get them great deals and prices, he also makes his customers feel welcomed with free cold water or soda and a a/c room to sit in while they wait. The staff at this location is amazing and very friendly. I would no go anywhere else for my business.<//Review>

owner will bend over backwards to get what you want. awesome guy to deal with. all 3 of our rides have wheels from this guy! and the prices are unbelievable....otherwise my wife wouldn't allow me to buy so much from him;)

on a side note, this guy does get busy, and sometimes hard to get ahold of him.....But, eventually, he always came through.....< /text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>Only reason this place gets one star is because I can't leave a zero. Place sucks. NOT a tire shop. I asked for 235/45 (not knowing they would not fit) moe says yeah 15min. So about an hour later I drive the car about 3miles noticing the rubbing. Take it back. Moe is gone and his guys tell me "you picked them". After talking to moe we try again. He says bring it back and if tires are not damaged we will work something out. I took the tires off the car and went back. Moe gone again/off today, whatever it was. Tires I brought back had 3mi on them and a shinny circle where they rubbed because his guy forced them on. Long story short. I pay, yes a discounted rate but I still pay for a new set of tires. I asked the guy will 205/40/17 work. He says "yes" so they put them on. They stretched a 6.5" tire onto a 7.5" rim. It doesn't work, looks like crap, and I'm stuck going to buy a third set of tires. Horrible service, they act like they don't speak English, and they are CROOKS!!!!</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Text>In my experience Mo and the crew at S and S Tire provided excellent service and a great selection of tires and wheels at reasonable and very competitive prices on several occasions. Go in see Mo.  Tell him Ken with the Orange 2010 Camaro and the 1995 Chevrolet 3500 referred you.< /Text><time>1399303126257<//time><pictures>None< /pictures>< name>

They are very knowledgeable about the tire industry and their prices are the best in town.
If you have any special needs for custom cars and wheels look no further they can handle it all.<//review>

I bought five rims and tires for my Jeep a year ago and have had zero issues. I made a ton of calls for quotes (even online) and he was by far the lowest. Was just rear-ended and had my full spare pop. Called him up to buy another tire and got me in the next morning.< /text>

<text>I have been coming here for years and this location has a great clothing selection. I used to get my shoes there most of the time but they were also great. The store is always stocked except for the ammunition department  since the pandemic hit they have been out. Some staff is not too friendly 🙄 😒  but for the most part the rest are helpful. The store is clean the parking is good and there are place nearby to get food before or after your shopping.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<text>This Big5 branch is well managed. I have been a customer for the last 15 years. I deducted one star because they never have a large or double sleeping bag. Other than that, I like this place.< /text>< userid>

For many decades, this store has been a go-to sporting goods store for me. In other words, this store and I go way back. I bought a slew of shoes and gloves last year, and I got them all here, even with all the crazy store limitations that we had going on back then, e.g. I had to wait in line in May a year ago before I could go on my shopping spree. The staff here is very hard-working and helpful. Perfect location in the middle of Burbank, but thankfully, away from the crowded downtown and Empire Center.<//Text>

Every so often they run  great specials. This week $50 off Nike sunglasses. The rep behind the counter was very patient with me and I end up buying two.. nothing like,  saving 100 bucks and getting a great pair of sunglasses.</text>

Bad experience I had today with this Big 5 Sporting Goods in Burbank. For about a week I've been looking online to purchase 3 spin cycle exercise bikes but I needed it to buy them asap, i was in the area and decide to stop by and wouldn't you know they happen to have spin cycle Marcy brand which I needed them now. I only give 1 star because of young ladies in the front counter very nice courteous and helpful but the large gentleman towards the back refuse to let me test the sample cycle bike in the store so in case it was not sturdy or to make sure it was just fair enough to purchase them, I tried and tried but basically he did not wanted to sell so I left upset disappointed, never will I go bck. Rude.</Review>

Great selection and in stocks at this store and the employees are helpful and courteous. I will usually only shop at this Big 5 store in Burbank. If you call them they are pretty helpful and upfront on stocked items. I signed up for their daily and weekly deals.< /Review>

Was running an errand in Burbank when I happen to see Big 5. Decided to stop by as I been in search for knee straps/bands. Big 5 did have knee straps/bands from one company, "Mueller."
Ending up making the purchase.

Note: Store is somewhat compact/small. So I had to go out of my way to social distance from other customers.< /Review>

Don’t bother asking if they have items on hand. They’ll tell you they don’t have stock but just be completely unaware that they haven’t stocked the items in the correct location yet. Highly recommend going to other locations.< /Review>

I took a shot at popping in to this big 5 to get some hearing protection.

The salesman was very helpful and happened to know that the particular model I was looking for were in stock but not on display.

They had what I needed AND it was on sale.<//text>

It was my first experience visiting Big O’s.  It is a really sharp place. The inside is spotless and the decor looks great.  Very comfortable atmosphere. The staff are very professional. Safety measures due to Covid are strictly enforced. That was awesome. Jay did an awesome job on my flat top. I will definitely be returning.< /text>

The store is easily visible from the street, ample parking, super fast checkout, the only concerning observation was a young female employee answered the phone on speaker phone and the person on the other side asked if " the shorts were still on sale" the employee then replied with a short tone" what shorts?". I felt the employee could of said,"I'm sorry could you please be more specific"< /Review>

<Review>If you're an educated shopper it's a great location to find hidden sales. You just need some knowledge or a bit of on Location researching as the staff is 50/50 on their sales knowledge. Not a bad place to get what you need at a decent price!< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Went for shoes and found a good variety of mid-quality options along with some of the bigger brand names. Shoes are stacked in boxes so you can serve yourself, but clerks are there to help or to check the storeroom in case you can't find what you want. Sales staff are non-commission and low pressure, but still quite helpful.< /Text>< pictures>

Was trying to call for thirty minutes. They must keep their phones off the hook which is infuriating because I don't want to drive 40 minutes total to find out the don't have the one and only item I'm looking for. Every other big 5 I called answered. Ended up making the drive, they didn't even know what I was talking about..</Review>

<Review>Nice store and employees. Couldn't find what we were looking for. We were searching for a larger tent and was window shopping pricing and availability of other necessities for our camping trip in August. They didn't have the huge variety of supplies we were looking for. All in all, still a great location with great prices but unfortunately all the items on sale weren't what we were looking for at the time but we'll be back! Really loved the landscaping of the tree located at the back of the parking lot. It may be for the security cameras but it looks like the tree is smiling which makes me smile!

Bot sports camera, nice discount to $45. Don't know if it works. Out of stock on sale headlight. Very unwilling to make substitute. Also very unwilling to make substitute on Crocs also on sale; $2 difference. Also unwilling to warrantee another headlight bot earlier. Don't buy anything except solid state. Buyer beware.< /review>

Friendly service. The price on some items is really good. I was looking for sliding pads for softball, they had them, but it was cheaper to get a pair on Amazon. Walked out without buying anything.< /Review>

Good place to look for sporting goods but the brands aren't that great at least for outdoor pursuits like camping or snow sports. It's a good place to get sporting clothes though and they're pretty affordable. It is a maze inside but the staff seems to be helpful and would point you in the right direction. Nice big parking lot and very accessible from traffic.</Text>

Glad I found this place. For you East Coast transplants it's like a cheaper Modell's but with better quality items. I always go there first for sneakers and Sporting Good type stuff. Unfortunately I don't really carry any hockey gear. There's also ample parking.< /text>< username>

Fantastic staff, super helpful. Great stuff that are simple essentials for camping and/or travel and/or sports. We found several things we needed for a trip at a great price. Aisles are a bit crowded but who cares. Terrific staff and easy location make it so worth a visit.</Text>

<review>One of those stores I never think about when needing something but then somehow end up there and getting what I needed. Loaded up on summer items for the lake. Shopping is a bit tight because they pack so many items closely together but having so many items to choose from is the positive flip side to that. Go here first, not those other messy stores.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

One of the few places in Burbank that reminds me that this town used to be a smaller community. Although this is a chain retail, it doesn't feel like it. The employees are friendly, helpful and generally have expertise in what you need to know. Your neighborhood sports store that needs to stick around.<//Review>

<Rating>2</Rating><Text>2 stars because their customer service was beyond subpar for a Big 5. Went in early Sunday morning, there were 6 of us, and no one was greeted. The girls at the front were obviously busy having their own conversation. Nobody spoke to us, nor provided customer service. We walked out, and the two girls at the register continued with their conversation without looking twice at us. They missed out on a big sale. Never again!</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Text>Worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life. Everyone from the sales associates to the manager were just plain mean and rude to my family and I. I would rather stick needles in my eyes then to return to this store ever again. Sad part is I was trying to purchase 500 dollars plus worth of equipment and they acted completely ridiculous.

<Review>This place is super crowded (as in not a lot of walking space space), has very minimal staff so getting help is tough. However, great discounts, usually the only place where you can actually find what you are looking for (specifically for sports). This is the best place for camping and fishing equipment.<//Review>< pictures>

Staff was friendly and even helped us out where to find the items we were looking for. Staff knew every corner of the store.

10/10 would come back for their service.</Review>

Typical selection if Big 5 items in a smallish store (in Burbank, on Victory Bkvd.) They usually have all the items on their specials flyer, but they may not always have all sizes. You might want to call ahead of time just to make sure you don't waste a trip.</Review>

<Text>Returned some pocket knives and was denied flat out, without receipt. Return policy says I should get credit at least. I told manager another store told me i could return them if I go to orginal store and habe credit info. After asking to see return policy, the manager finally caved and provided good customer service by looking up transaction. Received return. Should have led with good service. Too little too late. Future customer lost. Squeaky wheel...< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2955c41b0e73f:0x6cc929c48a1f76d0< /Gmap_id><user_id>111897639567780577684</user_id><user_name>Ruben M.</user_name>< response>

Terrible costumer service. Tried to buy an ice chest that we had just seen at another Big 5 on sale and they wouldn't sell it to us for the sale price. The manager was there and we even showed them online it was on sale but they were being extremely stupid and not helpful at all. Avoid going here if you can at all. I know I will.<//review>

came in to buy shotgun rounds for the range but the judgemental gun counter person was very unhelpful and acted like I was asking for the world when inquiring about the various 12 gauge rounds they had. save your money and time and go to Walmart or a different Big 5 store.</Text>

I Like Big 5 but the problem is fishing department is going down hill I mean they have no lines they have really cheap rods  there's not enough variety of things that I could like bass fishing forget it you're not going to find much there I think they're got into the clothing business maybe they should be opening in the malls< /review>

<Text>I was making a small return for a kids basketball hoop, and the manager was incredibly rude, harassing me for the reason of the return, "I just didn't like it" wasn't good enough for him, I had to be exact on why I was returning the toy,

Ignored the moment we walked In. Made eye contact With an employee as he walked into the managers office. We could hear them laughing and joking inside and they could see us because there was a one-way mirror. Just don't go here.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) There is everything for the sport, nothing to envy to other large stores. Variety of products and types, plus excellent prices and offers.
The staff is very friendly, also has ample parking.

(Translated by Google) Good place to compare things for different activities the bad thing is that there are some staff that does not have good customer service and they do not have much to choose with regard to snow shoes besides they do not have in many quantities
