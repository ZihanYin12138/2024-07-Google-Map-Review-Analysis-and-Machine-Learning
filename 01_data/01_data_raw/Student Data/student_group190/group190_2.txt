I have taken all of my cats and dogs to VMC for the past 17 years or so. Many years before that, when I was a teenager, Dr. Holstein would come to our small ranch to treat our goats. So he's been doing this for a long time. Everyone in the VMC office is so friendly and helpful. The veterinarians are very caring, knowledgeable, thorough, and take the time to explain what is going on with your pet in easy to understand terms. They tell you all of your options, tell you what they recommend, and then let you make the call. Over the years, I have had a number of pets enter the ends of their lives and have to be put to sleep. Dr. Klintworth has been there for my pets and for me through them all. She always brings in blankets to make my pet comfortable, explains what she is going to do, explains what will happen with my pet, and gives me the time I need with my pet both before and after. She is always so compassionate and, she too, loves on my pet before and after. On one occasion, when my children were young, they went with me. Dr. Klintworth explained everything to them, answered all of their questions, and helped comfort them before and after. I can't say enough good things about VMC and I highly recommend them. They are the best of the best.< /text>

Specialty pet supply  really saved our butts!
Our dog food was really hard to find for awhile & it’s a prescription diet .
Our Paso Robles vet totally dropped the ball on us and never received the order we placed 2 mos ago!!! Claiming were the only people they order it for so to them we’re not important enough to push to get the food from Royal Canine .
Luckily this place really cares about their furry clients & the special diet needs.
They got us enough food to last a few months and we are so thankful!
We will keep coming here for all of our pets needs!< /review>

Our pets have been patients here for 30+ years. Absolutely love Sharon Klintworth and Brad Holstein. They have always taken wonderful care of our fur babies. They explain every situation well and if one has to stay you are welcome to come visit. We currently have 5 cats, 1 dog and 6 chickens.</text>

Dr. Klintworth is amazing!  With my former vet, I felt like a number (and a bank account). Wait time was usually an hour, several different doctors with differing opinions, and prices were triple to what Sharon charges.  The moment you walk into this office, you can tell it is filled with compassion.<//Text>

The best care in North County.
I breed corgis and this is  by far the best clinic  in my opinion. They are offer prompt, personal service and I am allowed to go with my pat into the examination room and even be with my pet during some surgeries such as tail docking and dewclaw removal.  Dr Minor has performed several surgeries for my corgis and I have great confidence in him.< /Review>

Veterinary Medical Center is a blessing to my family. They have competitive rates and we are grateful that their cost is fair. They have even worked with us in a few situations in meeting our needs. They are gracious and forgiving when we forget to show up for an appointment (it only happened once, yikes) and provide excellent and thorough care to all of our farm critters. The vets there have gone above and beyond to save the life of our goat and our cat. While in their care I was allowed to visit my cat on my schedule (provided there was someone in the facility) and they never mocked my crazy nerves any time a pet is sick. I can't recommend them enough. On a practical note : the other vet offices in town care for house cats and dogs, the vets in this office have a background in large animal/ranch care. So, if your pet has caught something from the great outdoors they will be more likely to diagnose it here as I bet they are more familiar with the dangers of our local surroundings. I definitely recommend giving them a chance.</text>

<Text>I have been to a few other veterinarians in the Atascadero area. All I can say is what a breath of fresh air. I have Dr Brian Minor as my vet and am more than happy with his services. Such a great guy and great doctor. The pricing here is a quarter of what I have been charge elsewhere. The last place charges me 500 for ex-rays and this place charged 166 for ex_rays exam and medications.< /Text></record>

<Text>Great Doctors.  Very kind, explain the issues with you. No rushing you in and out like the other  places.  Do not get put in the rooms then get forgotten like I was at the other place.  I am very happy with Dr. Klintworth and Dr. Minor.  There is not the rip off like the other Vets in the area.  They are not cheap but not over the top, just real good value and truthful.</Text>< Pics>

The doctors and staff never fail to make me feel as though I am the only one with a problem. They are always friendly, welcoming and genuinely concerned.  Dr. Sharon is the person I usually see and she is an absolute doll.  I've also seen Dr. Minor and he is great too.

Thanks VMC for all your help and caring.<//text>

I have been with this clinic for over 10 years.  All of the vets have been very kind and supportive with all of our animal family members and with the human ones too.  Our animals have received excellent care and I have never thought twice about taking them to this clinic.  We have seen all phases of care for our many dogs and cats - the best of times and the hardest.  We have always been in the best of hands here.  Having supplies next door helps too.   Thank you VMC for so many years of support.< /Review>

I called your office with the difficult task of making an appointment to have my beloved dog of 18 years euthanized to end her suffering resulting simply from old age and her body slowly shutting down.  The phone was answered by a girl who SCREAMED in my ear that "we are very busy right now!!  is this an emergency?"  I was so offended by the unprofessional and discourteous attitude of this employee that I hung up (crying, at this point) and called another vet office that had a bit more compassion and patience.  I will not be calling your office again.</Text>

<review>Dr. Minor is the best!!  I had been run around by different vets regarding my dog's teeth problems... all I wanted was to get any bad teeth he had removed... he had been kinda mopey, his breath was terrible, he wasn't as happy as he had been.  Dr. Minor has a brand new dental xray and ended up removing all of his teeth that were abscessed and now my ten year old whippet is acting like a happy puppy again!!  I have recommended him to anyone that I can, already a coworker is taking her hound to him because she loved that my hound is doing so well!!!<//review>< pictures>

Best place to go, EVER!  I have been going there for so many years I can't remember how many exactly, but they have seen us thru many of our pets/children.  Dr. Klintworth is our main vet and she is so happy, go-lucky all the time.  We just love her.  We have seen Dr. Miner a few times while she was out and for an emergency and he is just as wonderful.  Dr. Holstein has done 3-4 surgeries on our family and is a very qualified and competent Dr.  He is very friendly when he calls after surgery to explain how things went.  I trust this office completely with all of my children's needs.  The staff is very friendly all of the time.  Office is clean.  The best part for my children is the treats they know they will get.</text>

My poor Mr. Wiggles got not one but two foxtails in his ear, back to back on a holiday weekend. Dr. Schectner Senior was there to treat him both times. The staff were caring and efficient both times. Doc was quick and although it was very busy he did not make me feel rushed. The price was fair for having to return two days in a row, same dog, same ear.<//Text>

We have known Dr. Hollstien and Dr. Klintworth for almost twenty years. They have taken great care of our animal family for all that time. You could not get better care any where else, they are the best.</review>

Since moving to the North County almost 20 years ago I've taken my pets (and strays) to VMC and have had outstanding service. I would recommend them to anyone. One of my stray cats walked with a swagger - I named him Elroy after the past LA Rams runner Elroy "Crazy Legs" Hirsch. I took Elroy to VMC to see why he walked that way. For a nominal fee they took x-rays and found he had been shot in the rear leg at an early age but the injury had healed itself long before I found him and took him in.</text>

<text>I could not ask for better service!  Dr. Hollstien & Dr. Klintworth have given our Furry Family the Absolute Best Care.  From simple vaccinations and Foxtail removal... to some pretty serious Injuries & Illness... they have always been there for us.  Wish I could give them 10 Stars!<//text>< pictures>

I have always had professional, friendly service and real concern for the care of my companion animals.  Recently we had to send our wonderful Great Dane over the Rainbow Bridge but she couldn't get up and we couldn't lift her.  Dr. Klintworth took valuable time out of her day to do a home visit to ease Katie's pain.  Bless you, Dr. Klintworth and thanks to the staff for always being concerned with the pets AND owners.

I have been with VMC since 1994. I love Dr. Holstien and Dr. Klintworth.  The visit with KC's shots  was a good office visit but again, she was so sick after the shots. Cried and limped for 3 days.  I wonder whether it is worth taking her because of her reaction.< /Text>

We went here twice and had poor experiences both times- the first time we took one of our kittens here, the women at the front desk mocked us for saying "bye, we'll be back" to our kitten, and complained about how grumpy our cat was when we picked him up. (He had just been neutered, and had been surrounded by unfamiliar people in an unfamiliar place all day... I think it's understandable why he might not have been at his best.)  The second time we were there, they left our kitten in her carrier for so long that she went to the bathroom (more than once) in it.  Very poor treatment of our pets and very poor customer service.

Additionally, went I left a similar review on Facebook, they "reported" my account and had my review removed.   If you can't handle one little bad review on Facebook, that only serves to increase my mistrust of this business.  Makes me wonder how many other low reviews they've managed to get rid of.</Text>

This place is way better than the one in Oakdale. Its very clean, not very loud and the owner is very friendly. This was our first time here and the owner both greeted us and let us know which laundry units were the best for our load. Definitely worth that few extra minutes of driving if you live in Oakdale.</Text>

Clean, lots of machines and they all seem to work. Had to wait almost 15 minutes after the posted open time before anyone showed to unlock the doors. Prices not clearly marked on every washing machine. Only two standard machines and one of them would not take my money. The dryers (red ones) do not tell you the time you have when putting your quarters in. I got 32mins for $1. All in all not too bad at $3 for a normal load washed and dryed. Folding tables are too high to comfortably sit at while folding which can be bothersome for someone like myself that has difficulty standing in one place for any length of time.</text>

Paul is truly one of the few that has earned my full respect and trust.

<review>Here's a go-to laundromat that is MUCH cleaner than the one in Oakdale, as well as the neighboring one over by Carl's Jr. in Riverbank.  "Paul" is the proud proprietor who energetically and enthusiastically keeps the machines running in tip-top shape, fastidiously cleans the machines and premises, and that vibrant energy translates to a No. One rating (5-Star) for Riverbank Laundromat.<//review>< Name>

This is the worst laundromat I have ever went to the whole place is always filthy every time I go in I can hardly ever find someone to help me and he is extremely rude and tells me all the time that I break his machines when I don't I would never go to this laundromat it is extremely expensive and the worst service I've ever had<//Text>

Seems like a real good laundromat. Clean and lots of machines that work with a tv to see while you wait! At one point when I first came here they had a lot of problems with the machines! The Asian looking guy attending seems nice?< /Review>

The menu is huge with all Hong Kong style Chinese foods you can think of.  Quality is good.  Has outdoor dining during the pandemic.  Could order by phone.  I ordered at the restaurant and had to wait for about 20 minutes.  Recommended.< /Text>

Went here for lunch. due to covid they changed some parts of the parking lot to an outdoor dining area. we've been lucky to get the last available table. when checking the prices we first thought that the dishes must be small so we decided to order a little bit more. well we thought wrong. the plates are full so we still could take a lot back home for dinner and most probably next lunch as well :) the food really tastes authentic like the food when I've been in Hong Kong. will go again< /Review>

Covid-19 update: I love that their outside dining is really open, seats are more than 6 feet apart and the wait staff are very careful about replacing drinks for refill, etc. 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
I saw a couple of outside dining places where they covered the sides too much (and tables are too close together) that contagion is almost the same as eating inside..

-------
They serve great food with great prices. I recommend getting their specials.</text>

During these periods, they have $30 family set dinner (3pm to 8 pm), add $2 more for 2 drinks or HK waffle. For the set dinner soup, they usually have 2 choices, Chinese or Western style soup. Since my wife and I have been craving HK foods for quite from time. I decided to get the Monday set dinner, Baked pork chop, Egg tofu w/ mushrooms, Beef w/ ginger onion. Even though they said it is for 2 to 3 people, my wife and I think we are able to eat this for 2 to 3 days. The foods taste great, not too salty and greasy. I will definitely try some other days set dinner again.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGOlZWeT0BeS6tz08c3c2Og_blRAnY1SjUqCac=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

Food was good and flavorful. Surprised that some of the sauces were tomato based. They also provided a soup on the house for dinner which was appreciated especially with the cold weather. We got the fish fillet with spicy sauce, crispy noodle with beef, don't think it's specifically in the menu, and mapo tofu. I've had better and spicier mapo tofu elsewhere, but taste wise the dishes were satisfactory, prices are good and we'll be back.</review>

Love it. It is replacement of old Ledo Cafe. The menu are almost the same. However the interior has been modified to make it look more modern. I like the new change.< /Text>

Portions were off the steak was smaller then my fist, you can't even see it on the plate, but nevertheless the food was good. The gap of Price and portion were too large making it difficult to enjoy my dinner there.<//review>

(Translated by Google) The food is very good and rich. The drinks are very rich and they give much filling and free glass to take away and all service.

When you order a burrito with only beans cheese and steak... yet there is salsa and avocado... how is this okay? I’ll just dispute the transaction.

I’m tired of POS places opening who can’t listen to a single request from the customer.

I guess I should just endure my food allergies and sue the pants off the establishment and then maybe, just maybe, people will understand.</text>

<Review>I really wanted to love El Capitan. It’s sad to see so many businesses closing in the Castro. But the quality was just meh. The menu is large which can be good but I question how fresh everything is. I stuck to a quesadilla. I was happy they had tortilla options. I asked for chips on the side. The chips we’re already portioned and not kept warm. Is it really that busy that you can’t cook fresh chips and scoop to order?

They have a salsa bar which is nice. But none of the salsas were labeled.

The quesadilla was just average. The quesadilla was served on a plate with a sheet of parchment paper. Not sure why the paper. It just soaked up the overly liquid filling and ended up tearing. The chips were cold.<//Review>< Pics>

The after taste you mentioned is not typical, and an indication that the cheese you ate went bad. I highly doubt we'd be in business if our cheese was supposed to taste like that!\n\nSeeing that our cheeses are 100% all natural and living, they are extremely susceptible to heat abuse. (Any time the cheese goes above 38F, the natural bacteria found in the cheese begins to convert the lactose into lactic acid, causing the cheese to sour.)\n\nIf you could please email us at Info@distefanocheese.com, we can open a claim to investigate why the cheese is souring from the location your purchasing it from.\n\nThank you for bringing this to our attention!"}< /resp><date>1592362526991</date><user>113831623880877875033</user><Name>Katherine Hall</Name><Text>I've tried their Burrata twice.

This cheese is the best I've ever tasted and I was extremely happy with customer service. They took my order as soon as i got in the door and i left, happy, with my order in 10 minutes. And to make it an even better experience, the cheese was amazing and fresh. I'm definitely coming here again and again!< /text>

One of the most tasty food I had! The level of spices were just perfect! They are open to late so that makes them even more special. The size of food is perfect. If you not so hungry than just go for a small size!<//Text>

<text>The cool guy with the earring who took our order was very helpful since this was our first time there. Exceptional customer service 👏the lady who brought the food and the other lady who was cleaning were also very helpful and nice. I absolutely loved the decor, all the cat and doggy art😍😍😍 so adorable. The artist did an amazing job!!! I love cats so this was such a treat. The food was amazing as well. The soda station was super cool and the flavors I tried were really good. We will definitely be back 🤗< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
New place that just recently opened up on the Main Street pedestrian promenade. The food is a great addition to the downtown eateries. If the hours posted are correct, this establishment is open 24 hours.

We tried the fried rice and the ramen dishes. Both were really great tasting. The food quality is good and so odd the price. The dining seating area leaves allot to be desired. The offer steel benches which are not the most comfortable and the soda fountain drinks are mostly cream soda flavors.</Review>

Ordered the vegan broth with tofu, mushrooms, and egg. Just right spicy. It was quite yummy.
The music in the background varied quite widely, so that kind of threw me off.
Bit pricey.

Edit:
Came back at around 12:30pm during a weekday. Service is timely. The music was way too loud in the front near the window. Ordered the vegan broth, bamboo shoots, egg, seaweed, and mushrooms. My mom ordered the niku broth (spicy), and that was good too. Wasn't too spicy. She ordered chicken and the other toppings I ordered as well. The chicken is way too dry, but has good flavor.

Will come back sparingly.< /text>< pics>

<Text>I've recently started exploring my city, and cities around me. When I go anywhere, I like to see what people have to say about the place of business. I have to say, am I glad I did when it came to Saku Ramen. I am a graveyard worker, so my days are nights, of course, and I ended up coming here with my siblings around 3 in the morning. I ordered a spicy Tonkotsu Ramen, and it was worth it. The photo I've added does it no justice since I couldn't wait.< /Text><Name>Giovanna Del Rio< /Name><time>1618360036675</time><Rate>5<//Rate>< GmapID>

I had the Miso broth at the "just right " spice level.  The heat level was well balanced.  Good quantity of noodles. Nice variety of toppings to choose from.  A good  Ramen, but not outstanding.<//text>

<Review>Have been to this place several times, I was only slightly disappointed once (they got our order mixed up) but it was super busy. A worker there said it was dog friendly and we were able to bring our pup in bit I havent seen any other dog or signs saying it, so take that with a gain on salt. Food is always delicious, soda selection is great. Lovely design. Good vibes.<//Review></record>

<Text>Service was really fast, placed my order and it was ready way before the schedule pick up time. This place takes your order pretty much at the door way so if anyone is in front of you, you'll have to wait. Noodles amount was a little low to me, I'll have to remember to order extra next time.<//Text>< name>

<review>If you're looking for cold, undercooked noodles, this spot is your jam! I ordered their highest level of spicy, and let me tell you, I've had jolly rancher candies with a higher spice level. The best part about this restaurant is the beer bar next door which allowed me to drown my disappointment with a couple of pints. To be fair, the pork tasted pretty good despite being colder than the broth was.<//review><Resp>None<//Resp><UserId.>108574392162478330059<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Overpriced cold flavorless Ramen. Kimchi tasted like dish soap. The staff was really nice though and the vegan fried rice was tasty.< /Review>

The vegan broth was good. I got the "just right" spice with chicken. My main issue was that the ramen was not hot but warm when they served it. The issue with that is that eating out side with warm ramen makes it cold faster. By the time I finished eating my noodles it was cold.</review>

Saku Ramen 🍜 is great!  It is open 24/7

The food is good, the please is very clean, a little expensive but for once in a while it's fine. The only thing that I don't really like is that the music was too loud. You cannot even have a short conversation because you have to almost yell.</review>

Over rated. The ramen noodles tasted horrible it's way to over priced and doesn't taste nearly as good. The atmosphere is horrible... The music's too loud and at least they could play better music. The fried rice was the only descent thing wouldn't recommend and wouldn't go back.<//review>

<review>Good ramen, perhaps the best in the inland empire, but most uncomfortable furniture for eating in. Very tall metal benches, so tall that your feet won't touch the ground. I'd suggest ordering to go and walking to Route 30 brewery down the street and enjoy your ramen with craft beer.< /review></record>

<Text>Downtown has been in need of this for so long. All broth are made in house and is exquisitely prepared. The yellow noodles are specifically made for the restaurant. Proteins are marinated as with any proper japanese proteins should. The fried rice is made to order and is absolutely phenomenon. Everything is put together fresh and to order. The fact that it's a 24/7 joint is just the icing on the cake.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Been hitting a lot of ramen places lately and this is one of, if not the best. My only gripe is it's kind of a build you're own bowl, which is fine in itself, but the starting price point is what a normal (already loaded) bowl would cost then by the time you load it up, you're getting into the $15 - $20 a bowl range. So it's a bit pricey, but it's really tasty. So it's worth the once in a while splurge.</Text>

Luke warm ramen... and not spicy at all. It’s fine if you’re desperate for food in the middle of the night but overall not worth the money.< /Review>

I rarely give bad review, but this a solid 1 start review. I would rather give -1 start if possible
1. Their manager is a big liar, he promised he will refund us the money, but he  let us go back home, then no refund at all
2. Their system has problem and told us it is ready in 15mins, but we end up spent 3 hours waiting there.
3. The order was wrong, they messed up the order and made a wrong ramen for me.

The food is pretty good. The seating however is very uncomfortable, hard and cold bench.  I hope they get some comfortable seating soon.<//Review>

The entrance is beautiful and grand with their giant wooden door, but everything inside is metal, cold, and cafeteria-esque which is not inviting to enjoy a nice meal and in direct contrast to the foyer. We ended up sitting next door at the beer bar.
The noodles came undercooked and the broth was luke-warm.
I ordered "spicy" the cashier said "are you sure?"  I said heck yeah! I love spicy. This was not spicy. So disappointed.
The ramen is meh. If you have a friend who doesn't like ramen and want to work them up to actually liking it, take them here, it's just soup with meat.
The pork was good, but the broth, noodles, and seasoning just wasn't there.
I should have known that it would be so bland, we couldn't even smell ramen when we walked in which is one of the things I love about getting ramen. So sad.<//text>< pictures>

Spicy vegan ramen was delicious. Very flavorful and spicy without it being over powering. The tofu was also really well marinated and completed the dish. Will definitely order again.<//review>

The food is good however the pricing is a bit high and they tend to run out of items. It's a great place to get local ramen by yourself or with friends if you're itching for that authentic-like taste<//review>

Honestly, I didn’t think I was going to find ramen this good in Riverside. Fried rice is bomb too. Person favorite is Vegan Fried Rice and the Vegan Ramen.

Not only is the food great but this is one of those rare spots whose service matches its food quality.

Must visit for Ramen in Riverside.</Text>

I would say it was delicious 😋, a little over priced for adding items into your bowl.  Overall I would come back to this spot and recommend trying it out to someone who hasn't had Ramen</Review>

So I was excited to try this new ramen place but after trying it I was greatly disappointed and let me tell you why. So at this place you order your food, pay for it, then you get a text meeage when it is done to run to the front and pick it up. What kind of half baked restaurant is this where they have a machine that wants me to tip and no one is serving me? That's just lazy. The seating is terrible as it's just a metal plank on to polls set up high that you sit on that very uncomfortable. The food in itself is not worth the price you pay as you have to build your bowl and for each item added can be very steep as the bass price is high and does not come with eggs.  Don't spend your money here the noodles are also douughy. Go to KAz or Okinawa</Text>

Ooh this was some really good ramen. I had the tonkotsu with konjac noodles and it was bomb. Ordered pork as the protein and the flavor of it just added everything together. They offer dine in & outside seating. Fun personalities from the workers and guests! Highly recommend :)< /text>

<text>I would give it 5/5 for taste and flavor  but indoor seating is the most uncomfortable and also they don't even have soy sauce with white rice hahahaha Other than that the ramen was just as good as Kaz Ramen which is the best in inland empire. If you just want some good authentic japanese ramen give this a try.<//text><time>1614488672071< /time>< rate>

Came in on a Saturday night at 11:00, bought the miso soup, and honestly wouldn’t go below 3 stars because the food is good. However, the girl at the front had an attitude and stared my girl down. Then when we got our food, she just left it there, didn’t say anything, no water, nothing. I regret tipping her but I’m hoping the cooks get a part of that at least. Just felt unwelcomed there<//Review>

Got a great zip wallet ($100) for $31! Decent selection, however some items seems too obviously produced for "outlet". I am a so-so Kate Spade fan.

<text>Unfortunate experience.
Non-friendly staff.
Limited selection.

Some bags were dirty, and there were a lot of unmarked items, which was a bit frustrating.

The manager was very unhelpful, the customer service was horrific, and the people were very rude, and the way they spoke to my mother was unbelievably condescending. I'm shocked that they would treat people that way, and the manager, whose name was Lindsey, clearly did not care if she was losing customers who are not happy.

It's worth it to go to LA and deal with LA traffic to avoid this store. Or honestly, I just won't get Kate Spade if these are the types of people they want representing them.<//text><gmap_id>0x80c3358213624a65:0x25800c64cf8d9e32< /gmap_id>< username>

Bought a bag that didn't work out and went to return it a week later and they wouldn't accept it. Terribly rigid return policy. The ladies that work there are really snooty about it. I will never shop here again. Save your money and buy at a place like Nordstrom or Amazon that has amazing customer service. Now I'm stuck with a $160 purse that I hate because there isn't a closing mechanism and items will fall out so easily</Text>

<Text>I love that they are constantly getting new styles in. The jewelry is always adorable, well stocked, and at least 40% off if not more. Today it was 60% off. They are very well staffed so you never have trouble trouble getting any help, and check out is very fast.<//Text>< Pictures>

I've been a loyal customer for years, I've shopped brand and Outlet as long as I can remember. Last year when I purchased a handbag, that I absolutely love... it wasn't made properly, when I try to take it to the outlet store for some help. Unfortunately I wasn't within my 1-year policy and was turned away. The handbag was obviously not made properly which a manger agreed, the handles were ripping the leather of the handbag almost detaching. The store manager rebagged my bag and send me on my way and said they couldn't help. They no longer do repairs on bags and didn't offered to exchange even though I was willing to. But that's just the policy, truly disappoint and after I made an additional purchase.<//review>

Nice ambience and fitting rooms.

As their tag sensors interfere with one another, it can be quite iŕritating. My coach purchases keeps triggering its sensors

Friendly staff and efficient short queues<//text>

Won't shop here anymore came to do a return of some pants that fitted way to big and they told me twice that I hade already wore and wash them so that they couldn't return them 😡😡😡 how did I suppose to wear them if they fitted to big didnt make sense and I told them and their only response was we cant make a return seen u wear them already...
And they where not even nice their answer was rude I guess just because I came in my working cloth looking chuntii🙄😡</review>

The sea bass tacos are AMAZING!!!! Seriously the best I’ve ever had. Drinks are also great. The passion fruit drink is delicious! Sat in the cabana, vibe was pretty chill. Will be returning for the tacos.< /review>

This place is so beautiful.   I know they have recently change the decor from traditional to modern.  Miss the piano

I love the breakfast here with amazing granola, Greek yogurt, fresh pastries,  juices, daily paper and coffee!

There's security guards everywhere.  Feel safe but not.

Beautiful place to see.  I love the new decor.<//Text>

She was so funny and honestly turned my night around! The drinks were delicious and the atmosphere was really chill but definitely kind of avant garde. It was a nice place to chat with friends and the patio was so cute, just beware it closes at 11. All in all, pretty adorable, artsy, LA bar with great service.</text>< Pics>

<text>I don't remember exactly what I ordered because this visit was about 3 weeks ago but it was on the specials menu... Name had the words "3 Kings" in it. It was fried squares of pork belly, some very well prepared duck, and i forget what the 3rd king was. Came with small bit of white rice. Overall, good dish to order but I felt the pork belly was not the best I have ever had. Very dry actually; perhaps cooked too long.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

They do also have food you can order. Haven't had that in a while, but I don't recall it being terrible, so that's a good thing!<//text><GmapID>0x80c2c7b77ca40001:0xd1c2a78aea957ec1</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I'd strongly recommend stopping by for a drink. Glad I stopped by to see what the new wonders did with this classic place.  I loved the old spot but it needed a facelift and the new owners did it well.  A great new vibe while still maintaining the neighborhood bar authenticity. .You won't be disappointed. I'll definitely be back often.<//Review>< Pictures>

Came here on a Saturday night to celebrate my 25th birthday.
I contacted Elizabeth the bar manager ahead of time to see if I could reserve a both or two for about 20 people.
She responded back promptly and was able to accommodate my party.
We arrive at the bar and it wasn't terribly crowded which I liked.
The atmosphere was very relaxed and chill.< /review>

First time here we came for my friend's birthday dinner. Need to make reservations in advance inorder to get in and they book fast. The place is decorative from the outside and inside looks nice as well. Parking can be valleted for $4 or street parking. They have the salad bar where you can get your sides and then of course it's the meats. The food is very good and service is great, very friendly staff. It's a nice place to try if you like Brazilian BBQ.<//Text>

This places used to be Maeves Residuals and is now just Residuals. But now its even better.
They have redone enough to not be gross but still retain that divey, neighborhood bar feel.
New TVs so you can actually enjoy watching a game.
Bartenders have been and remain awesome.
Relatively cheap.
Darts and board games available.
Highly recommend!< /Text>

<Review>In the 30 years of dining out, I've never been treated so poorly as I did here. THIS PLACE IS THE REASON BABY'S CRY. They threw the pizzas at us, didn't bring our appetizers out, the pizza was cold, we weren't greeted, had to request our tab, our water and table to be cleaned. I literally went to order our meal and facetiously asked if he was having a good day. Wrong!! Iadvised the host and got a sorry "were busy and hectic tonight. Arms up and everything. Am I in the twilight zone?  I am appalled. You slide the fries on the table two seats away because fries are so heavy and all.  If you go here, I'd give you $10 not too. Save yourself. For me. Please. The last thing I need is to try and give you the last ten minutes of your life back :)</Review><name>Kristy Duncan< /name>< user>

Would love to see the hotel rooms here.
This is an old hotel with 2 restaurants-one inside & a Mexican in the back by the pool  that is by a really cool/small/private pool setting!
We ate in the hotel area by the fireplace (& huge beautiful Christmas tree) You can eat sitting at the bar, in the actual restaurant room or open lobby area with couches, fireplace. ***Take your chances if you dont have reservations. Can sit at bar, couches, 2-3 tables without having reservations.
Hotel from the 1920's. Mission-type architect. Beautiful! LOVED it! Want to visit again. 2 blocks from LA Live. A new favorite from my LA visit.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Super delicious tiki drinks. I'm in love with this intimate bar- it is full of cool memorabilia and art.
If you like yummy rum drinks, I highly recommend this bar.</review>

So this review is for Pride weekend, which was AMAZING, and two weekends before, which was meh.  Three plus five divided by two is four, hence four stars.  (I can do simple math past midnight, wheeeee!)< /Text>

His nails were so overgrown that he caught it around the kennel witch caused it to break off. We are sorry that you had a bad experience. If you have your puppy maintained with regular grooming you should be able to avoid the issues your dealing with. And your fur baby will have a much better and comfortable life. Thanks again APG'}<//Resp>< review>
Took my very nervous dog to get groomed and let them know that my dog gets very nervous so he can react on that,they said that was fine. Got the call to pick him up and to my surprise when I got there I was made aware that he lost his middle nail from his paw because try to  it got caught in the kennel and that he was bleeding I got no call prior to picking him up and they did not let me know when I called for an update. I would not recommend.My dog is currently still limping 2 days after and he has really bad razor burn on his ears and belly area.<//review>

Took my miniature poodle to a groomer once that had thirty years experience and my dog was traumatized.  I haven't taken him since--until now. Tried All-Paws today as I am not a groomer. Lol
I walked in and my jaw dropped! My poodle looked beautiful! They are efficient and friendly! Great price! Edgar Silva groomed him and will be his groomer from now on! A shout out to Stacey for giving him a great bath and making him look white again!<//text>

This place is fantastic! The owner is great! During all of this pandemic we had  Acquired a  Guinea pig that had toenails that were so long its toes were starting to deform. He came out to the house face mask gloves and clipped nails right in front of my house! He really went far and be  beyond!< /text>

Absolutely butchered my long haired shepherd. Then blamed me for the poor judgement and trim. I took my dog there and asked for a trim with minimal shave/shaping. Came to pick up the dog and found they shaved the legs and made our dog look like a cartoon. DO NOT GO THERE with large breeds</text>

I have a little Miniture Poodle mix with severe anxiety. Everything from separation anxiety to just anxiety in general. After I rescued her I worked a lot with her anxiety and though she improved a lot, I thought grooming may be out of the picture for a while. But I tested my chances with All-Paws and I'm so happy I did. Her first appointment she was very nervous shaking and growling, I was surprised I didnt get a call to go pick her up because they couldn't get her under control. - I just dropped her off for her 3rd appointment this morning, and she ran up to the door excited to be there. I couldn't believe it. This is definitely our grooming spot now! I dont know what they are doing in there that is working so well for my dog, but I couldnt be more appreciative of their patience and hard work. Thank you All-Paws! I cant wait to pick up my pooch today and see the amazing job. Did I mention that they gave her a mohawk upon request and she looked fabulous?!< /Text>

My dog has come home with injuries. A cut between her paw pads, they shaved too closely on her stomach and gave her razor burn, and she came home the third time with a limp. The owner himself said he would groom her personally the last time I took her so I was relieved. But that's when she got cut between the pads on her paw.</review>

First time taking my dog she had cuts and razor burn on her stomach and armpits. Her hair is uneven, and when cutting her nails they don't even file them down, they leave them sharp. I won't go back.<//text>

I used to love this store, but after Covid hit, it seems like they don’t want anyone shopping in their stores anymore.  Recently, I tried to go in and the lady at the front letting people in acted like it was an imposition to go in. There was only one other customer. The rest of the people were employees. They try to put nasty smelling hand sanitizer on you before you go in and hand you a disposable bag to shop with. I started looking around, but didn’t find what I was looking for. As I was walking out, I tried to hand the bag back since I didn’t see any trash cans and the girl, again, acted like I was gross and wouldn’t take the bag. Very rude. You might as well shut the stores down and just go online at this point. I don’t mind Covid precautions, but this was just ridiculous.<//text>

<review>Just came to pick up at the valley plaza store after I received an email that my order was ready and it took them about 20 minutes to give it to me. Their excuse was that my order was not coming up and they had to make it again. Why would they send an email that my order was ready if they weren’t going to have it. Their store need to be more organized with pick up orders.< /review><gmap_id>0x80ea6a701d417e29:0x184ab46f42ec7224</gmap_id>< pics>

<time>1582674465978<//time><rating>3</rating><review>I think it's a little to much. I would go more often if the prices were a little lower and the rewards program was more rewarding. The candles smell good however the candles from Wal-Mart last longer and smell just as good and less expensive. The body creams are good but price could be lower. I give a 3 because the candles smell good. I don't think I'll return for a couple years</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Very long wait at the store. Over the phone I was hung up on. Just a lack of customer service and urgency with the employees of this store. I even had an online order to pick up and that took forever to receive.< /review>

Great store lots of lotions, body washes, sprays, perfumes, candes, and much more. They have just about any scent you can imagine. Store was super busy but staff was nice and line moved fast. Also, they always running specials and deals. Download their app also. More coupons.< /Text>

<review>I love being able to wash my hands here. The soaps smell so good. Some of the seasonal scents are kind of... off. And it can be pricey if you don't go during one of the crazy good sales. But it is a quality product.<//review>< Pictures>

This store is generally packed and thier customer service is fierce. I do not normally go into this Bath & Body. The store was empty of customers and thier wall flowers were on sale. I was not assaulted at the front door which was nice. When I was greeted she did not force me to try a product or insist I buy thier deal. She was friendly and helped me find the scent I was looking for. I will return.< /text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>Went the other day and this worker was asking how I was doing . Kind girl with highlights and Yolanda was really loud like I already helped them . The girl was just asking a question.  Very unprofessional of Yolanda which by the way she wasn't helping me she helped the girl next to me . So she lied to that girl . Also while I was in line this customer in front of me was asked who helped her and she mentioned 2 names one being Yolanda and the other girl and Yolanda just dogged the customer and the cashier was like who helped u more . And the lady clearly said the other girls name and the cashier laughed and said ima just say it was Yolanda.  Like why ask if your just going to put her name anyway . Making the customer feel awkward and uncomfortable about who's making sales .<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Review>1. Got rid of true blue spa vanilla almond body cream.
2. Got rid of Limoncello with olive oil hand soap
3. Can never find the lemon hand sanitizers anymore
4. The hand soap with beads in it is so messy I hate using it anymore now have to use the foam that’s why I’m upset about the limoncello This has nothing to do with my local store & everything to do with Corp changes. We love the people who work at our local store. They get 5 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟<//Review>< pics>

I'm going to guess the VS DM and the BnBW dm are the same person?  This stores in such disarray it couldn't pass osha.  Most displays are dilapidated and the fire spriklnklers wouldn't work if there is an emergency.  I'm going to call it understaffed and not managed or maybe not having resources.  Either way.... gross.</review>

Amazing selection of cocktails, and they rotate menu periodically. Bartenders are super knowledgeable, will make anything you want off menu. It's a little dark, drinking vibe.

This is one of the few places where $15 a cocktail is absolutely worth it. Read through the drink menu - almost all of the drinks have flavor combinations that you would have never thought of and every single drink is delicious. The food is great too - definitely not an afterthought like many bars in the covid era.

The seating is well spaced out for social distancing and the wait staff is courteous and quick.

Well worth the premium price tag.< /text>

<review>Caitlin is awesome! There are so many options on the menu and she hooked us right up with each of our very different taste buds! Drinks are so unique. Very pacific vibe. Great atmosphere and service. Try the “Oh Snap”!Thank you for being such a gem of a cocktail lounge!</review>< pics>

Be sure to give this place a visit in the holiday season when it decks out to become "Miracle", a local favorite Yuletide "pop-up" bar! In a city somewhat starved of classic holiday activities & venues (aside from the Christmas tree & lit up palm trees in Union square, there is really not much to write home about on the Holiday spirit front), this bar would probably be among my top recommendations for those looking to get into the Christmas spirit. There is not much seating, it gets crowded very early, and drinks are on the expensive side to say the least ($16-20 cocktails! - but rest assured, most are fantastic, such as the popular Buddy's nog). Pro tip: come early (on weeknights around 4pm if you can, 5pm latest) and there will likely be no line + still a couple seats available.< /text>

Great vibe and ambiance for a bar that serves great whiskey cocktails. Had both a manhattan and old fashioned with rye.  The bartender took his time and effort with the drink and it definitely came through in the taste.<//review>

Innovative and succulent libations quickly served by a team of friendly mixologists. Setting is a bit weird and plain, not really matching the quality of the drinks, but atmosphere is still pretty good.</Text>

They set up a super cute outdoor patio, had the most creative cocktails I've seen in a while (sugarsnap peas, li-hing, lilikoi ingredients), and were good about enforcing safety and masks. Definitely will be back soon!<//Text>< gmapID>

<username>Laura Dell< /username><Review>We've recently developed a taste for very interesting, unique, excellently made cocktails, and PCH is the perfect spot for this exact case. They have dozens of cocktails in their menu, special cocktails on a chalkboard, and even cocktail recipes painted in the decor that you can order too. We tried 3 cocktails each and all were excellent.</Review>< resp>

They have a huge variety of cocktails, and every one we had was delicious and refreshing. My favorite was the Lime in da Coconut-- it tastes like a key lime pie! We also tried the Tuk Tuk tea (scotch and Thai tea), Stop and smell the Rose, and the Ninth ward which had banana in it.</text>< pics>

This super sleek bar has yummy high end cocktails prepared by fantastic mixologists. As with any high end cocktail bar, you pay the price at $14 per drink. Good service and fabulous drinks.</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>We spent four days in San Francisco on a “cocktail tour”. Out of all the bars we visited, Smugglers Cove and PCH were by far my favorites.

I’ve seen inventive cocktails before, but never have I seen a cocktail menu as comprehensively inventive and original as PCH’s, without it feeling gimmicky. So many really great drinks, with so many original and tasty ingredients!

Cannot recommend enough!<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwn3E4KonToBW_qFTKcPLE4T7kBY1znMXIxjsG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_MtKbDOyrdQEGSabj6_2-nFOFZl9TSpPG3v9O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMblnh44lNC41ydrRiYX-8VSWqCBoFcEpXv8tK3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOobqqGl-LLrz-usqZP00uNzJgBLPHQMjnL8xro=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdK88xHdTdZNaJilWwVd6cbXFIiiJAj93cQotR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

I came here with friends and it was awesome! We made reservations in advance but had to change them last minute and they were pretty accommodating. We came in about 1.5 hours late and they didn't charge us at all.</Review>

Swizzle my Nizzle!! Pornstar Martini!! - two must-have cocktails at PCH. We had a complete blast sitting at their bar, learning about the latest cocktail trends, sipping heavenly well-balanced concoctions and meeting amazing locals. Super creative $14 cocktails all day long. Expect flavors from exotic juices, elixirs and bitters of calamansi juice, cherry blossom, passion fruit, vanilla, salted pistachio, lychee and much more. Great place.< /text>

My friends were in town for a short while and had some free time and decided to stop by here. They have a karaoke bar which is really cool. Finding seats isn't too hard. The drinks are tropical themed and are quite tasty. Service is good and the staffs are very nice.</Text>

Charming Christmas themed bar around Christmas and New Year's. The drinks are all about $16 a piece and holiday themed. The egg nog was sweet and boozy and very easy to drink. The snowball fashioned was a well executed take on a classic original. I have not been to this bar except for around the holidays but from my perspective, a unique and fun way to spend an evening.< /Review>

A great place to grab drinks in the city. They only serve rum-based cocktails (but trust me, you'll find something for everyone in a group), and do not have snacks or any small plates.</text>

Discovered this place on Instagram and as a Christmas lover, I had to go check it out. We arrived Friday night around 11pm and there was a line out the door. The line moves rather quickly which is nice. The interior is super festive - love it! The drinks were about $16 each and not that great. I got the Koala-la-la - it was interesting and really sweet. I would go check this place out for the decor but maybe order a drink not from the holiday menu.< /text>

This place has some of the best cocktails I've ever had and I love getting fancy drinks. I ordered the Miso Old Fashioned and the Three Sheets while my friend got the Shizzle my Nizzle.

The waitstaff is great and if you tell them that you're having separate bills, they're really cool with it (just remember to tell them as soon as possible).

Some of the prettiest cocktails I've seen in awhile. You'll love it. I promise.<//Review>

Also loved the Lime in da Coconut (not pictured). The bartender/waiter who served us was friendly and clearly had a passion for mixology. We also appreciated the relationship they have with the restaurant next door: Hogwash. You can order at Hogwash, and they will bring the food to your table at Pacific Cocktail Haven.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRDDqHV0axPfVBIwU0_owwq9fyFSopzJd_fut7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5GkckkIJuRcMu37O5QZhg_gnJLXuTRbLu7xuv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

Flying into a city and immediately going to a nearby cocktail bar seems to be a thing-to-do for us (with the BF). The bartender was friendly and helpful in guiding us to our choices :) pandan, citrus and curry in a few of our drinks — mix of savory and sweet. Highly recommend coming when it’s less busy (1230-1am xD )< /review>

<Review>The Christmas pop up is great, they really go all out with the decorations — they even have a fake snow machine! Expensive cocktails but they’re on point 👌

I tried the Jingle Bells Nog and Christmas Carol Barrel, both well-crafted.

Expect a wait during popular times; both to get in as well as getting your beverage of choice. 🍸<//Review><time>1575516763370<//time>< user>

Not a bad spot for a cocktail.  I was here for the Miracle holiday popup, and damn if you need some holiday cheer, this is where you go to OD.  Friendly staff and strong drinks.</Text>

My sister and I were in town for a short while and had some free time. We decided to stop by this bar since we found it on yelp. They have a karaoke bar which is really cool. Inside looks like a Pacific Cocktail Haven for sure and finding seats isn't too hard. The drinks are tropical themed and are quite tasty. Service is good and the ladies behind the bar are very nice. If I were in town, I would definitely come back.<//Text>

< Review>
Sarah is a hero - her recommendations to my vague adjectives were actually exactly what I wanted to drink. My partner agreed that we had some of the best cocktails of our entire life.

A party of 30 walked in as we were entering but we never once felt neglected - both barpeople checked on us often and we were not feeling like we were a bother at all. Love this place, will be back.<//Review>

Not sure what happened here.....   Miracle is one of favorite visits every holiday.  Tried to visit today and the doorman they have hired was the most unprofessional and rude I have ever experienced.  He would only let me or my wife in, but not both of us....  because he felt like it.  He also was humiliating the guy in front of us because he was wearing a turbin?   Time to find a new Christmas bar.  And time for you to find a new door person!<//text>

Great place for a drink! Lots of selections and the bar tenders are fast. Drink selection is unlike most bars, very unique. I like PCH's vibe and uniqueness. Music selection is on point. I liked how eccentric it was.</Review>

I've been to several artisan cocktail bars in the city and they all sort of end up tasting the same, not PCH!  The list is extensive and there's something for everyone, even mocktails. It's also not a crowded nightmare during happy hour.</Text><GmapID>0x8085808e80f0678b:0x65dd807d5d205482</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

A definite most if you like perfect cocktails.

Not expensive (considering other not so good places)

Amazing!!!!! The ambiance, the service, the drinks were just on point. The bartenders know what they are doing. I would go again for sure! The location is very relaxed, lounge like, dim lights. Location is small with a cozy and personal feel to it.! A+< /Text>

Ok I'm not even a drinker and the cocktail I had was excellent. Such great flavors and creative. Expensive, but again I am not a drinker so I could be wrong. Staff is knowledgeable with good suggestions for someone like me. We went there 3 times in the week. Oh and ordered food from next door and they delivered.</Text>

I know it may not be fair, but I usually rate bars based on how well they can make an old fashion. This place does a fantastic job. The other cocktails are equally amazing.<//text>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Review>Awesome cocktails and friendly staff, however your bill can add up quickly with each cocktail being $12-$14. There are unique cocktails for every type of liquor, so there is something for everyone. It is dark and pretty loud, but the decor is nice. There is extra space/tables in the back which allows for more room to sit, but not great for a large group since it is often busy. They don’t serve food but you can order from Hogwash (next door) and they deliver it to your table at PCH.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOx6NO3PCSlAkcyEPKu590YqTyDLwUKFKk9QU1w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

An AMAZING cocktail menu with all kinds of spirits! They do have a happy hour menu with drinks about half the price of regular hours. Location is pretty small and not good for groups during popular hours. Music was kind of loud.< /Review>

<review>Great ambiance and not too crowded (albeit I went on a Tuesday night). Craft cocktails were great -- they do the large block of ice in your drink, so it doesn't melt too fast and water it down too much. Would come here again if I were in the area!<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Really really good drinks at this place, especially if you like tropical-inspired cocktails. My Malaysian friend ordered this pandan drink that was phenomenal, so the lot of us all ordered that drink for round 2. The cocktails are generally fun, tasty, and imaginative. The ambiance is cool around the bar, though not super exciting in the back. Good for groups when it's not too crowded, which it seems to be often.< /text>

This is a great place for an awesome craft cocktail. The bartenders are awesome and willing to direct you to a drink that you will enjoy or try and come up with something that matches your desires. The TukTuk Tea is a must. It is a fun space and remember to look for the secret menu.< /text>

Although it was the middle of the week bar was very crowded. It was hard to find a little place to stand. But definitely it was worth it.. All drinks were very good and fancy.<//text>

<review>Great place to get drinks after work, although pretty crowded. Best for smaller groups of less than 4. Also, be prepared to stand. There is some seating in the back but hard to come by.
I was pleasantly surprised at how awesome my cocktail was. I got the "Oh Snap" with gin and sugar snap pea and absinthe. It was sweet, strong, refreshing and overall delightful!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x8085808e80f0678b:0x65dd807d5d205482< /GmapID></record>

Great cocktail bar near downtown SF. They have seasonal cocktail menus. I went during the holidays and had a nice egg nog drink and another gin drink called Fa la la la. The coconut drink with lime is also a popular standby drink here.
It can get pretty crowded with a narrow bar in the center. There's a bit more room in the back.</Review>

We came in two nights in a row with a party of eight bartenders from all over the country. The atmosphere, service, cocktails, everything were more than we could have asked for. Miguel took care of us both nights and is an AMAZING bartender. I can't wait to go back next time I'm in town!< /Text>

The drink was alright but the waiter was extremely rude. The way he circled around our table trying to get us to order another drink made me think he’s training for the half marathon.<//Review>

If you enjoy and appreciate creative, well balanced and delicious cocktails, you will LOVE P.C.H. I've been to the bar numerous times and it's consistently amazing! It can get busy but I absolutely love the vibe and welcoming staff here. Oh, and their ice game is strong - I have never seen branded ice. One of the best new bars in SF if you ask me.<//review>

Fantastic original cocktails with inventive ingredients and interesting presentation. I have always enjoyed my drinks at PCH.  But customer service is awful, and the venue is too small.

Two major problems:
1 - It's too small and crowded. This is partly due to popularity, but also due to a really small venue with bad layout.  The bar is right in the front, and most of the seating is in the back, so there's a chokepoint - it's very hard to get past the bar to the back. They also don't have near enough seating, and have wasted a lot of space with hallways that can't really be used to stand.

2 - They rush you out.  I was there on a date recently and they rushed us out after our second drink.  We arrived at 8:15 on Friday and got our first drinks around 8:30.  We ordered a second round of drinks around 9-9:15.  Around 9:45 as we were finishing those drinks, the server asked if we wanted another and we said "we're good right now."  We didn't necessarily mean we were done, just taking a break.  The server brought us the check.We let it sit there, since we weren't ready to go and might even want another drink. About 5-10 minutes later, the server came to ask us to pay so he could give the seat to another group.  WTF?  I said we were still chatting and might drink more, to give us a bit.  5 minutes later, another person, presumably a manager, came to ask us to leave.  Seriously?  We spent $70 on four drinks and they kicked us out less than 15 minutes after we finished the last drink.

I understand that a busy bar doesn't want people hanging around for a long time if they aren't drinking, but this was something else - they literally asked us to leave as soon as we finished our drinks and passed on the next round.  I couldn't believe it, especially from one of my favorite cocktails bars in SF.<//text>

<Text>This place is worth an insanely priced uber ride while visiting San Francisco. While sitting at the bar, I personally watched the bartender pour out a perfect cocktail because he said it “wasn’t quite right.” If that is not the most extreme example of attention to detail, I do not know what is. If all customer service and quality of product was this great, the world would be a different place. Thumbs up to the PCH.</Text>< pictures>

Here’s the thing: if anyone rattles off their “favorite bars in SF” and doesn’t mention PCH... don’t believe them.

Hands down this is the (in my opinion) the best spot in SF for phenomenal cocktails. Disclaimer: please don’t come here and just order gin and tonics or Jack and Cokes, the team will graciously accommodate you but you’ll be the jerk saying it’s “overhyped” while the regulars look over sadly knowing you’re missing out on a superb experience.

Let them do that they do best: make a drink that forces the question: “how the efff did that work?!” Quite literally pick your favorite liquor, ask the bartender or just shut your eyes and point, whatever you land on from their menu will exceed expectations.

Btw: the staff makes the bar, this team is at the top of their game without pretension< /Text>

<date>1534559135308</date><text>Really good cocktails, and a pretty extensive menu. My friend and I both went the bourbon route. I had a Back in Black, which was a manhattan riff. I am not even sure it was a riff, just a damn good manhathan. She got the Sho Nuff and really liked it. I would go back based on the quality of the cocktails, but I the crowd was a bit of a turnoff when we first arrived. This place was packed to the gills just before 7pm, I think because of their happy hour, and it was hard finding any place to stand. Right after 7pm it started to clear out a bit and we were able to grab a seat and it was more my speed, and my friend and I could actually talk to each other comfortably.< /text>< Rate>

The music is so loud you can't speak. I asked for a zombie and the bar tender didn't know how to do it, so he used an app to make it. It was nothing like the cocktail it should be and they charged me randomly for 18$ for a little glass of something which I wouldn't call zombie...</text>

"Your friendly neighborhood bar" is what how the website greets you. An understatement.

From the welcoming and accommodating service (bring your own food, or order from Hogwash next door) to the exquisite, ever-changing cocktail menu, this place is the new hot spot in San Francisco.

The drinks are creative and fairly priced ($12-$15). My favorites: the spicy Swizzle My Nizzle (Olmeca Altos Blanco Tequila, passion fruit, vanilla, lime, habanero bitters, $13) and the amazingly fresh Ko'olina Swizzle (Banks 7 Rum, Banks 5 Rum, banana, orgeat, pineapple, bitters, $13). I do like my drinks on the sweeter side, but there are plenty of other options on the menu.

Cocktail lovers stop by - this is a great spot.<//Review>

Place is absolute garbage.  Cocktails were disappointing and the staff was rude.  100% will not be going back and would recommend to stay away if you can.< /text>
