I used to work nearby and came here frequently, but since I don't work nearby anymore, I haven't visited here for years.  Just ate here last week with my wife, and the food is still very tasty.  I had the combo pho, the wife has the seafood egg noodle soup.  Both were very flavorful, in generous portions.  Prices were very reasonable as well.  Would definitely come back when I'm in the area.< /Text>

Car was in the shop at American Tires down the block, so I decided to kill some time and eat Vietnamese food. I'm no culinary expert, but the two rice dishes I ordered tasted okay. Portion sizes varied--House Special had more food while the "Tender Chicken Thigh" dish was a little less. Overall interior was clean and bathrooms decent. Service was prompt and attentive. For Tustin, this is a decent restaurant if you're in the mood for Vietnamese. I didn't try any pho dishes, but heard they were very tasty.< /Review>

<review>Went with my friends because this is their Pho place. They say it's the best in Tustin. I was less adventurous and had chicken and rice. #52 on the menu I believe. We all enjoyed our meals and will definitely return. Staff is pleasant and made for a nice lunch experience.<//review><response>None<//response><Rate>4</Rate>< Date>

My husband and I have been ordering take out from this place for over a year now. We always order the same thing. 2 beef brisket phó bowls. Sometimes he orders and sometimes I order but he is always the one who picks it up. It's a 5 minute walk from our house. We continued to order frequently even throughout the pandemic. One time, i guess there was a misunderstanding between my husband and the man who placed his order over the phone. He went in to pick up our order and got 2 phó brisket bowls and upon leaving, they called him a few minutes later to ask if he was going to come pick up the order and started getting angry with him over the phone. So when he went into the restaurant to pick up our order, there was a miscommunication and instead my husband placed and paid for a new order and the takeout order was never picked up. So they thought he never came in to get our order. This was over a month ago and we have ordered at least 3 times since then. So tonight, my husband goes to place an order for the same thing we get every single time - two beef brisket bowls, and the man taking our order starts acting like he isn't going to serve us because we didn't pick up our food that one time. Well, it isn't like they ask for a name when you place your order. So my husband walking in and saying "two beef brisket bowls" and picking up fresh ones by mistake is NOT anyone's fault if it isn't the fault of the restaurant. There should be a better process of dealing with takeout orders. Needless to say, we won't be giving our patronage to this place anymore because of how rude our experience was. We went to the place next to Stater bros tonight and will continue to from now on. Personally, I don't prefer their phó and it isn't walking distance, but their service is worth the extra effort. They are always so nice and always serve us with a smile... Never threaten not to serve us food because of a misunderstanding. I would reccomend going somewhere else, especially if you are not Vietnamese as the language barrier makes it difficult for them to understand you. It's unfortunate, we would order here like 3 times a month. Never again after that kind of harassment over a simple misunderstanding. I suggest you try somewhere else, as well.<//text>

<Review>Absolutely the best Pho in Southern California. Been coming with my family for many years and every time we try Pho in a different city, it is never as good.  Fresh Asian vegetables, flavorful broth is not too salty, generous size portions and reasonable prices.  Very quick for takeout too.<//Review>< pics>

Great service, the owners are so nice! Really good food at such a fair price. I've been stopping by for lunch almost every day for the past few weeks. If you're on a time crunch is place is perfect! They can get you in and out of there in minutes!</Text>

Ordered the large rare steak pho. Portion size is good, but the leaves were limp (not crisp), broth slightly salty, and the steak was too tough to be considered rare. Strictly speaking, just average pho.

They do show sports on their TV, though, definitely a plus.

Family friendly and popular.< /Text>

I have been here ever since I was a kid and I would say it's a really good pho restaurant. I have tried several different pho places, and if visiting Garden Grove or Westminster or any other well-known pho restaurants are too far, this is the best place to go to in Tustin. Comfort food with a welcoming service. I suggest the Pho Dac Biet for any noodle lover. The eggrolls are fairly good too. Rice and chicken plates are decent. Definitely try this place out.< /review>

Super fast service, friendly with good food and a wide variety.  I really enjoyed the combination noodles, lots of different flavors.

3 tvs and nice long tables in the middle make it great for groups as well.</Text>

I recommend stir-fried noodle (phở áp chảo), it's full of flavors. However, their regular pho lacks of ox bone taste and a little too sweet for me. Taro smoothie is okay.< /Review>

My favorite Pho place in the Tustin area.  The Pho tastes great.  Service is bare-bones and quick which is what I expect from an authentic Pho place.  Go somewhere else if you want classy service, but chances are the Pho will cost more and taste worse.</text>

< review>
I ordered the Pho Dac Biet. It was good. I think the broth could have been a little bit better. It wasn't the worst broth either. Parking is terrible here so I would try to avoid going here during a meal rush. I ended parking at Domino's next door hoping the whole time that I wouoldn't get my car towed.

As for service, we went when it was lunch rush and everything came out pretty fast. No complaints about the service at all.

This a four star because of parking and the broth (although good), was just missing something that would have made it great.</review>

Awful! The service was horrific. I informed the kitchen about My cilantro allergy and they still served the pho with cilantro and did not re make or re serve a bowl without cilantro. I would never ever come back and recommend that you stay away.<//text>

Pho Hung Vuong serves good pho for a vietnamese restaurant that is outside the little saigon. Can't compare with Pho 54 on Brookhurst and McFadden. The price is the same. Whenever I come here I eat Pho Tai. If you live around Tustin and hunger for Pho, try this place out. One more thing, their service is a bit better than those inside Little Saigon.<//Review>

Excellent place to mattress shop! Big variety to choose from. I didn’t get the car salesman vibe you get from some places. Tomika was amazing! She was so helpful and very knowledgeable. I was able to find the perfect mattress thanks to her help, which is very much appreciated.< /review>

Amanda was able to walk me through the process of finding the perfect mattress for me. Since having my new mattress I have never slept better. Also, being new to the area I was looking for a reputable place to purchase additional furniture and had no idea where to go. Amanda referred me to a local furniture store that had exactly what I was looking for and at almost half the price of what I had seen it for at another store in the area. This is where I will be coming if I ever need additional bedding. I highly recommend this store.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I had a really good experience at Mattress Land. Amanda, a store representative, was able to help me find the perfect mattress for me and my budget. She was patient, not pushy, and very attentive. I could not have asked for better service. I will be sure to return here for any other mattress purchases.<//Review>

I recently purchased a mattress at Mattress Land on Ming Ave in Bakersfield.  The entire experience was phenomenal.  Tomika was extremely helpful and very enjoyable to work with.  In addition, Manual and the warehouse crew went the extra mile the help out as well.

I wish I could give 6 stars!<//text>

Amanda was amazing! She went out of her way to help me get the right mattress set in a hurry for my aging mom who was moving to an assisted living facility in 2 days. I was literally driving around town in a rented moving van looking for a bed and not only did Mattress Land  have what I needed available to pick up the same day but I also had a choice of mattresses. And I got a great price. Satisfied customer here.<//review>

Incredible location to get a new mattress. Compared to other locations, they had the best prices for the specific type of mattress I required (side sleeper). The sales representatives, specifically Amanda, that helped me were very open about their return, exchange, refund policy when I asked about any concerns I had. She made the process very straightforward and simple and I was able to get a mattress very quickly. They also offer curbsdie drop off with no additional cost. Nonetheless, I had a great experience and would suggest Mattress Land for getting a new mattress and a good night's rest !< /Text>

<Text>A great mattress-buying experience. Amanda was very knowledgeable and patient while my fiancée and I tested mattresses and asked questions. Hopefully won’t need another new mattress for quite a while but I would absolutely come back here. Good buying incentives on the premium mattresses along with great financing options made for an easy purchase.</Text>< UserId.>

I met the same lady that I spoke with over the phone and she got me exactly what I wanted. No upselling and no BS. I will definitely shop here again!</review>< user_id>

Tomika was amazing. She had us in the sleep machine to find out exactly what type of mattress our bodies needed and it didn't disappoint. She showed several different options in our firmness and was super patient and helpful. She worked up an incredible offer on sheets and pillows that we couldn't pass up and now we're just waiting for it all to be delivered. We went to 4 other places in town but finally decided to purchase here because of Tomika's customer service. If you're looking for a mattress skip all the rest and save some time go to Mattress  Land, you won't be disappointed.<//Text>

I was so lucky today to find information out about a new mattress - by text, online and by telephone. My thanks go to John, who so patiently helped me select what I was looking for; and to Amanda - who called me to go through my order, process the payment and put me in line for delivery tomorrow.  Super service - so much appreciated 😊

My mattress was delivered on Saturday - the delivery men were prompt and efficient.  The mattress was carefully placed on my platform frame and I received my other two items, along with a recommendation to read the washing and drying instructions.

I will recommend this MatressLand store to others.  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️< /text>

<text>Tomika was friendly, helpful, and committed to finding the right fit for my partner and me. She found the perfect mattress for us and sat politely through our bickering while we went round and round to ultimately choose her first suggestion. Thank you for your time, Tomika; it was a pleasure!</text></record>

<review>Bought a mattress and box spring from this place.  Sales lady was great.  After that it went down hill.   Waited 9 weeks because of covod to finally get delivered.

I got it set up, one of the box springs didn't come with paper work. The delivery guy made a not about it.  Fast forward 3 months and that box spring is broke.

I call them out because they have a warranty and they denied my warranty.  Haha for improper use.  The box spring that was probably defected already and the reason they had no paper work it now mine.

What a joke. Why have delivery and have your team set it up if they are setting it up incorrectly and violating your warranty to begin with.   Your own company basically violated the Warranty for me when they set it up.< /review>< name>

<text>My boyfriend and i were in the market for a new bed but weren’t quite sure what we wanted.  Tomika Strobehn was our Sleep Advisor and she was awesome from start to finish! She was very informative and was more than happy to answer any questions we had.  She did her best to make sure we were happy with the mattress and the price and she wasn’t pushy at all.  It was clear that customer satisfaction was her main goal and not the sale itself.  If anyone is in the market for a new mattress I highly recommend you go see Tomika, you won’t regret it!</text><username>Harley Jackson< /username>< date>

Hello to anyone that may be reading this review. I can honesty say without a doubt that my day of visit on December 12, 2020 was absolutely amazing! I went with a friend that day to just look at mattresses and see the prices. As soon as I stepped into Mattress Land located at 3658 Ming Ave. Bakersfield CA. The sleep advisor TOMIKA STROBEHN approached me and my friend. At first I thought I was going to get the question “what are you guys looking for?” straight of the bat. However, I was proven wrong Tomika welcoming felt like someone that was inviting me to there house to have a cup of coffee with laughter and joy. I never felt pressured or anxious when I was talking to her. Tomika was amazing help with being patient and understanding about my situation about purchasing a mattress. She showed me a variety of mattresses that were around my price range and some that were ONLY in store deals. Also, if I may say she’s not there to sell you the most expensive mattress but really cares about the clients that come through those doors. As we started to discuss about numbers(prices) she offered me a deal that I couldn’t refuse. In all honesty I even questioned if she was able to do that offer but without a doubt she was not playing around. At that very moment I took my card out and said let’s do this. So if anyone that wants to seek or wants to get informed about a mattress I would highly recommend you stopping by Mattress Land and asking for TOMIKA STROBEHN to assist you! Whoever is reading this review you have nothing to worry about! She is here to help you and that’s a promise! Happy holidays everyone!

Thank you, Tomika Strobehn!

Super friendly staff. Our salesperson, Amanda, represented her company well. She gave us multiple options to stay within our price range and allowed us to take our time in making a decision that was right for us. ;)< /text>

<text>Came in knowing exactly what we were looking for. We were studied up on what we needed and just wanted a “quickly” transaction. Sales man, John, took us straight to options that met our specifications... it was a very pleasant experience to have a salesperson who was knowledgeable but not “pushy” in anyway.  We left feeling heard and like we paid a very fair price.  Can’t ask for more then that... well, you guys could make my bed?!  Lol.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Very friendly staff. I explained what I wanted up front and was quickly and immediately shown options based around what I said and never had to repeat myself. The sales representative knew exactly what she was doing and I walked out with a new mattress( the first one I tried out, even!) without any confusion or hassle.<//Text>

Josh made it easy for us to make a choice and purchase a mattress set. Thank you Josh for being informative and for making it such an easy purchase. We plan to to come back for future purchases.

< Review>
Tomika Strobehn was a great sales rep, she took the time to show us mattresses that both I and my girlfriend would love (we’re very picky) and even talked us through price ranges to make sure it was the perfect fit for us. I’m glad Mattress Land was the first and only stop for our mattress shopping!</Review>

<text>Russ went out of his way to make my dad and I completely comfortable while I found the perfect mattress.  I paid a fair price to say the least. To be completely honest he went above his call of duty to take care of me and nobody can come close to his mattress expertise and experience. Thanks Russ for keeping it real.

Omg! Tomika is awesome! After checking out different mattress stores I went straight back to her at Mattress Land! She completely got my personality and while addressing all of my concerns never once made me feel like she was simply trying to make a sale!

I appreciate her and my whole experience! I am so happy with my choice and cannot wait until I get to sleep on it!

I also met Josh and we had a fun time comparing mattresses to cars! It was awesome!

Great experience for sure!

Thank you guys!<//Text>

The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about their industry and the products they recommend. The buying process was extremely comfortable and therapeutic; no pressure to buy anything. Since we spend roughly 30% of our lives in bed, we left the store knowing we made a great investment in our health and well-being.<//review>

The staff is very friendly and helped me find the best mattress for me. Tomika assisted me in finding a mattress that not only fit my budget but was very comfortable. She had me use the mattress fit to see what kind of mattress I needed so that I got the best support. I felt that she truly wanted me to get the right mattress and wasn’t worried about just making a sale. After testing out different mattresses and seeing which one was right for me I purchased the nectar memory foam. Great mattress and great staff at Mattress Land. I would not go anywhere else for my mattress needs.<//review>

We have had waterbeds from 1974 on so this was a new experience. Our sales person was so sweet. She worked with us showing us every bed in our “sleep range” even some that weren’t so we would see what was out of our range. We were so satisfied when we left . AAA . We haven’t gotten the bed yet but 👍🏼 Thumbs up so far!!</Text>

<Review>I just had a great experience here. Marissa was great! I came in less than 30 minutes before they closed and didn't feel rushed into buying anything. I was given time to figure out what mattress felt the best to me. Marissa was very knowledgeable about the mattress I picked. She seemed to have a LOT of experience. I haven't had the same experience anywhere else, and I've been everywhere it seems. I got the best deal in town by far here. Make sure this store is on your list and make sure to ask for her. Marissa has upper management written all over her. You can tell by the surge of great reviews they have been getting, she is a keeper. Thank you Marissa!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1543439493404, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback Chris!

I really enjoyed coming in to the store and get shown around and asked what I was looking for. Chris Roach was a great help and very helpful, also sharing some of his personal experiences with the mattresses. Very quick and easy and overall a great experience.</text>

My husband and I have been looking for a bed, but we wanted to get a good deal and the best bed possible at the same time. I met Marissa from Mattress Land and told her about the beds we looked at preciously. She told me that she actually had the same bed on clearance. Also, that there were plenty of others to choose from as well if we chose to go a different route. Marissa was so professional and personable, making us feel comfortable and not pressured during the whole experience. We ended up getting an upgrade to the one we previously looked at, along with amazing pillows all for a price lower than was quoted to us elsewhere. We are so grateful for coming here and being treated so well. If we ever need another bed, I know we are coming here. They have an amazing selection for all sleepers and the best deals in town. Highly recommended!<//review>

I was amazed at how far the technology has come now! They have this cool bed sleep fit thing that analyzes you and tells you what comfort level is perfect for your body and sleep type. Just like the Dr Scholls machine Does when you buy gel inserts. Besides that they have very friendly and knowledgeable staff, who are genuinely just trying to get you in a better bed and better state of sleep. They carry some really nice brands as well, I didn’t get a bed on my visit but I plan on returning for sure to get my mattress from here. I don’t normally post reviews like this but I felt like I needed to! Thanks Mattress Land.</review>< pictures>

<Review>My husband and I went into Mattress Land SleepFit on Sunday at 5:45 pm.  They close at 6:00 pm and we were hoping we had enough time to purchases a mattress that same day. Felicia was great, she has amazing customer service skills and my husband and I were blown away at how professional and honest she was.  Honesty is very rare in a sales type position and we were grateful. My husband and I both walked away feeling like this was the best experience we have had by far for such a large purchase. Felicia gave us a great deal and worked right within our budget, which was extremely helpful considering we are expecting! We felt Felicia went above and beyond to assist us with our purchase even staying over 30 minutes after they were closed! Usually stores push you out or make you come back the next day with coming in so close to closing time.

We have yet to receive our mattress as it will be delivered on Saturday, but as soon as we do I will update this review for the mattress itself!

I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone looking to find a good deal on a nice mattress with AMAZING customer service!!!

Thank you Mattress Land and FELICIA!<//Review>< UserId.>

Officially one of my favorite sushi places in the valley! One of the best all you can eat options I’ve seen and the price & quality can’t be beat! Service is always great even with large crowds. Highly recommend!< /Text>

Food was delicious service is great the staff was friendly and accommodating price was reasonable. Well I thought the sushi had a little bit too much rice the fish the rice ratio was really really nice. Unfortunately was only able to get a photo of carpaccio before my phone died<//text>

<Review>Had great expectations for this place, sadly every minute turned to be an epic fail without possibility of redemption.
Our server had no idea about the sushi off of the menu. Stating that she hates sushi and can't tell us about it.

Our bus boy was standing over our table as he was too busy watching the basketball game on television hanging next to our table.  Though getting his attention was nearly impossible.

We opted for an all you can eat option. Our orders were coming out extremely slowly with down times for nearly 10 minutes between entrees. Each next order came with a larger chunk of rice and smaller piece of fish.  We had to ask over and over for things that we ordered on round 1 while round 3 was already painstakingly slowly coming in. Last set of sushi was served on warm mushy rice.
By the time we asked for our check some stuff still did not come in. Our server simply failed to even enter some of the things into the system.

The fish is very fresh and high quality.  The sweet shrimp are simply amazing.  The execution and service need major improvements.</Review><rate>2<//rate><GmapID>0x80c299a3996c78df:0xd0fd16ec3c6e8bb2</GmapID><UserId.>111064938870986625866</UserId.></record>

< review>
Great place for all you can eat sushi especially during COVID-19 time! Would recommend and come back for more. So many varieties for shared dishes. I would recommend fried squid legs and shrimp and veggie tempura, As for special rolls I like zeppin roll and black dragon roll. Great service and dish presentation. The only tiny bit complain is the chair is rather uncomfortable to sit on and the floor needs for a sweeping. Keep up the great job guys!<//review>

They have All-you-can-eat Sushi! It's amazing.  I have never been in a Sushi place with this option. The food quality is ok not the best but overall it was a good experience. They also have happy hours good for people that normally eat 1 to 3 rolls.<//review>

Great place for sushi. Same good taste, presentation and portions as Octopus. Happy hour is very good. A La Carte is reasonable for people who don't need the all you can eat.<//Review>

<text>Zeppin Sushi is now my favorite sushi restaurant in Los Angeles! I love the all you can eat option, but be prepared to be full after the first round. The options are limitless! This is a great place for indecisive people like myself. I look forward to my next visit at Zeppin.<//text><date>1615587213191</date>< pictures>

They are sooo slow. Slow to seat you, slow to bring the food once you order. You just have to watch the sushi sitting at the sushi bar and no one grabs it to bring it to your table. So frustrating.<//review>

Stay away from this sushi place like plaque and DO NOT fall for the fake reviews. The quality of fish is just bad!!!! And their service is even worse. It took them 50 minutes to bring out our first round, and second round never came. Please don't waste your time or money on them.<//Review>

<date>1622194473542</date><Rating>5<//Rating><review>Went to celebrate a friend's birthday and had the ayce lunch. Amazing quality and quantity for $23.95.   It's $28.95 at dinner.  That includes tea (ice or hot) and a small cup of delicious ice cream for dessert.  Each person gets 5 items per round, for up to 2 hours of ordering, but of course you can stay and finish long after that.   The food comes out fast, so they don't make you sit around trying to stall your food orders to save money.  It's all fresh, delicious and varied.  Really nice fried and baked items, and the raw seafood was very fresh.   Nice rolls, with a thin layer of rice as well.  Definitely quality.  It's the same food as if you were ordering a la carte. Only the carpaccio sashimi has an extra charge: 99 cents for first round,  $1.99 second round,  $2.99 third round.  We all left stuffed and very satisfied.  The only thing not great was the teriyaki chicken and beef.  Both came out only tepid, with a goopy sauce, and the beef was very tough and chewy.  Skip those.  But everything else was delicious.  For around $30/pp including tip ($5 more for dinner),  you can't beat it.   It was so great I went back 3 days later with another friend had it again!   I'll go again in another month. Thank you Zeppin!</review>< Pictures>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Well today. I had an emergency I broke my screen on my phn. I use my phn as a business phn. Well long story short it's a sunday everyone is closed. Some business run around the clock and 7 days a week. These days cells are very crucial in maney ways.
On a sunday after 5 pm. @ 545pm. I walk into cell phones. I state plz help emergency. My phn broken I can not contact customers or get any calls in or out. Tomorrow is monday I'm a day behind by damaging my phn. They stated no prob. They took in my phn. By 556 pm. They come out of the operating room. My phne back to life. I'm back in business and Ready to take on monday. Great customer service. Very knowledgable. Professional. Fast prompt service. Open 7 days a week plus plus plus were compition doesnt understand the role mobile phones play this day in age.
Thank you guys. You got 10 stars. Will recommend to everyone.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>I went in with my galaxy s6 to get the s7 just for something a little newer. I'm so glad I did! I was set up with it totally equipped before i left the store and everything that was in my old phone was transferred over as expected! My newer phone is so much nicer, clearer and has fun updates from the s6. So glad I had them help me out. I also was able to sell my old phone for a reasonable price to them and put that towards my new phone so it was a win win deal. I called to thank them and they said well since you liked our service please put it on Google. So here is my review. I'll never pay full price again when I'm so happy with these guys.</text><UserId.>115153248564654605230<//UserId.><rate>5< /rate>< username>

I brought in my iPhone with a cracked screen  and tablet with a messed up charging port and I was quoted a very reasonable price. The iPhone got done in an hour, but I had to wait a couple days for the tablet because it got sent out for that repair. Which was no rush in getting it back right away anyways. I was very satisfied overall with the work. And they were very welcoming, helpful and polite. Will be going back and sending people their way.</review>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>I broke my phone screen the first time, and they fixed it for one hundred and something and it worked great.  Several months later a puppy chewed the edge of my screen when it was left in his run area, and I returned to Sell Phones.  This time when I picked it up it was less than a hundred and why I did not know.  When I started using the phone I found out why, they used a generic screen that was not sensitive and pure junk.  I could not the adjust brightness, which is a sign of aftermarket junk I later found out.  I returned to the store and explained the problems, and asked the store manger to attempt to type a text message on my phone.  He very clearly understood the that a text message was a very difficult task with the screen they provided.  They confirmed that they installed a very low quality screen, and their offer  was for me to pay $80 dollars for the right part and they would install the new screen free.  I said In would give them $40 because that is about the difference from the junk screen and the good quality screen.  NOPE, so I left with just my frustrating phone that bothered me so much, and was so useless, I purchased a new phone elsewhere.......AVOID this place unless you want a real headache.<//Review>< pics>

<review>They said 30 day warranty and i had my phone less than 2 week and it stopped charging. All they would do is give me $10. Off another phone. They dont honor their word, policy, or their dam warranty. That place shouldnt be open. After writing this review Im making a call to the Better Business Bureau.< /review>< pictures>

<text>They get the job done fast and effectively- for a decent price as well.... But don't listen to their advice about phone batteries. You should only charge your phone to 100 and let it drain complete to dying only once a month. They advised that this should be the way all phones should be charged every time because it makes the battery "last longer". I am so glad I did my research and found out the truth before I destroyed my battery faster! (I imagine it is to get you back in their door sooner)<//text><Rating>3<//Rating><Gmap_id>0x8084acac962e4d55:0x70b1171b15cf60c9<//Gmap_id><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Pics>None</Pics><Rating>1< /Rating><Text>UPDATE.... Does the business only keep transactions for 3 days????????? Bad business if they do. When you ""fixed"" the phone for over $100 and then it stopped working in less than 1 day. Then you tried to fix it again but could NOT. When you handed over the DEAD phone, you should have handed over the full refund at the same time. This would have been the honest and right thing to do. ....................................................................Charged over $100 to fix a phone, it worked for one day and they kept the money.< /Text><name>tom s< /name>< user_id>

Love this place each employee has great customer service. Willing to work with you and repairs are awsome on all phones.
If they dont have what you need they get it special ordered for you and make sure you leave a happy customer. Easy no contract plans for phone services for all that dont want a plan with contracts.<//text>

<review>This place is great! Very helpful fixing my iPhone. It had locked up tight and nothing I tried would unlock it. I took it to these guys and after diagnosing it they said it had self terminated..... not good! But......... they were able to save it somehow and they were even able to restore everything I had on it that I thought was lost for sure. These guys saved me about $600! They worked on it for 2 hours and only charged me a minimal fee! I will definatley go back if anything else happens!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

As far as I'm concerned, I will never ever do business here again.  I took a phone there to be repaired.  Paid for these repairs, but when I got home and put the SIM card back in discovered this wasn't my phone. When I returned the phone the same day, they would not  give me the correct phone, the one they gave me does me no good, because it's registered to someone else. Now I'm stuck with a useless phone, and a loss of $140.   They completely screwed me!</text>

Had a broken USB port new one replaced, phone works,  only took 2days to repair  And 60 dollars, I'm  happy. Feel stupid for taking so long to figure out that a cell phone repair shop was right in Yuba city.< /Review>

My girlfriend walked into this store, and received an estimate for a diagnosis on her cell phone during her lunch break. I came to the store shortly after with her phone because she had to return to work. They quoted me a different price for the diagnosis, and were not willing to negotiate on the difference with the quote.  I paid their new up charge, and they quoted me an hour.

So I ran some errands around town, and showed up shortly after an hour. The same salesman told me that the test was not done, and that it would be not too long before they knew what was going on. I was okay with that, and asked for an appropriate time to come back. They told me they had my number on file, and they would give me a call when it was done. I took off again and returned about 45 minutes later to check on the status of the phone.

A different person from the back came out which I figured was probably the tech.  He asked to see my receipt, and continued to ask why I had showed up without being called. I figured he was busy, and already upset with a separate customer. I told him that I wanted to get an appropriate time that I would be called that way I can arrange my day approipriatly, (at this time it was five till 5 pm). He became upset when I asked again for a better time estimate. Another salesman came from the back, and tried to tell me that I need to leave so they can do their job. I told the third employee my conversation with second employee was not delaying the computer that was plugged into my phone. I restated all I wanted was an estimated time. Both employees went to the back after saying they were just going to hand me my broken phone.

The original person I spoke with came from the back, and he told me very politely that the tests were not done yet. He explained it would be a little while before they called me. I was okay with that, and went to exit the store when the other two walked out of the back. The second employee had my girlfriends phone in hand.

The second employee handed me the phone, and stated here's your phone, goodbye. I asked if it was fixed, and he said "No you can leave my store, I'm not touching your phone anymore." I asked for my refund, and he said "no you paid for it and I don't like the way you spoke with me." I told him I paid for a service that wasn't fulfilled. He told me he did not care, and he was not fixing the phone.

I spent a total of almost 2 hours waiting to receive a service that I did not get.  The second employee that spoke with me also identified himself as "Jagpreet, the owner of the store."

Hope this is useful< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x8084acac962e4d55:0x70b1171b15cf60c9</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

My loud speaker went out. My choices were to buy a new phone for $200, or replace the speaker. I called Sell Phones and they replaced the speaker for $35. I gave it a 4 star rating.< /text>

<review>Such a cute little spot! The wines were really good and the tapas are delicious. The service was great, and everyone seemed to be pitching in and helping to assure all the guests were cared for. We don't live nearby but we will definitely be back the next time we're in the area.<//review><UserId.>107191289861377684789<//UserId.>< date>

A very cozy environment with a relaxing ambiance. Tomato bisque was pretty tasty. A nixe wine selection if you're into that sort of thing.<//Text>

Cool little bar in downtown. The doorfront is small, make sure you don't miss it.

Went downstairs for a work event. Loved the large cocktail list! I recommend the Local Edition, similar to an old fashioned. They have live music on a stage later in the evening. The music isn't too loud so you can still have conversations!< /Text>

It's quiet and relaxing ambience with a terrific wine list and delectable food choices.  TAPAS are the way to go but the entrees looked delicious. wine floghts are excellent in taste ans reasonably priced.< /Review>

<text>Great lunch specials!  On Friday my wife and I each had the salad, soup, and a slider. Not a lot but very satisfying. Sorry it’s closed today (Monday) cause I would go back today.  Easy walking distance from my work (Superior Court).<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Great happy hour.  Good house wines. Good variety of tapas. Intimate and smaller venue along 4th street in Santa Ana. It's nice to support and frequent a local venue.<//review>

I give it 4 stars. It's not my style. More of a wine place than anything else. Food wasn't all that great as far as tacos on Tuesday. Bill was cheap but not some place I'd return to unless I was really into wine.< /text>

<rating>5<//rating><user_id>105536843127229431886</user_id><time>1620620375352</time><Text>Excellent Mexican cocktail and food establishment in downtown Palo Alto. Recently opened. We were impressed by the high quality of the cocktails and food, the uniqueness in the menu items, and the excellent customer service that knew "everything" about the menu. Prices can be a little steep, but that's California. I would compare this place to Milagros in Redwood City, but this San Augus has much better drinks and food. If you're looking for a high quality restaurant experience and amazing craft cocktails, I highly recommend this place. Details to follow:

[The Drinks]
Starting with the best part, the drinks were excellent here. They have a wide variety of cocktails I have never tried anywhere else. Most of them are named after sayings or phrases in Spanish. They don't taste like they have a bunch of fillers and artificial flavors. The drinks tasted real with quality ingredients and careful thought into the mix. We tried about 5 and couldn't decide which one was our favorite. Could use just a tad more alcohol but they were balanced, and we will absolutely be returning just to get drinks one day.

[The Food]
We were really impressed by the food too. The presentation of the food and the quality was what we expected given the price. We got Quesabarria tacos which were excellent. They have a variety of different offerings which are well described and seems to be high quality. We were absolutely impressed.

[The Location]
The restaurant is located near University Ave in downtown Palo Alto. It's in a nice spot near Caltrain, off the beaten path so there's plenty of parking. It's safe, well lit, and has outdoor seating! The restaurant looks super clean and well maintained!<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Eat everything. Drink nothing. Do not drink at this restaurant. We spent $400 between the three adults and we were all sober as a nun. The food is amazing the drinks are so light that I wonder if there's alcohol at all in them. don't waste your time. Go somewhere else.< /Text>

One my favorite Palo Alto spots I've tried. Off the beaten path of university, this place offers a refined take on Mexico city street food and awesome mezcal cocktails.

Chapulines (grasshopper) quesadilla is yummy and unique, with interesting texture and a smokey tahin flavor.

The torta cubana is 🔥🔥🔥 so so good

Their pastor and chorizo tacos are delicious with doughy fresh tortillas

The ¿VAN CON TOCHO MOROCHO? Cocktail is excellent.

I will be going again to try everything on the menu!</Text>

San Agus is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. The attention to detail in every single one of their dishes is clear, and their chefs treat their dishes as art playing with and mastering every flavor.

I don’t remember our servers name, but he works the bar and serves me everytime I go there. He makes the experience great, and is so prideful in the dishes served.

If you want a fantastic meal in a great atmosphere with carefully thought out dishes and service, go to San agus.<//Text>

Urban vibes, swanky cocktails, cute bites and friendly staff. All at very reasonable prices for the area. Great for a first date. Attire smart casual. The Xochimilco cocktail was a highlight and the Gorditas were superb (even though on the spicy side). Along with Ettan, these are the best cocktails I've tried in Palo Alto.  Highly recommended!</Text>

< review>
The torta cubano was absolutely delicious. Loved the flavor profile and have deep depth and complexity. Good mix of meats and veggies with a lovely toasted bread. Sauce tied everything together. Price was good and the portion sizes are good too.

The esquites on the other hand was a salted creamy corn and cotija cheese mix. Portion size is a bit lacking IMO and the flavor was interesting but a bit over seasoned and one dimensional.< /review>

Amazing cocktails matched by selection of wonderfully conceived and executed simple but very delicious mexican street food. At the moment, the best cocktails around university ave in Palo Alto. Eusibio is killing it! Of you love tequila or mezcal, this place is truly special.</review>

<Date>1592284751753</Date><review>San Agus is the spot to go to when you are craving some Mexican street-food style! They definitely take it up a notch. I got a few things on their menu, including their Torta Cuba, which I quickly became a fan of. Phenomenal service from start to finish,  neatly packed food, and great portions. I will be returning here again & again.< /review>< Pictures>

I brought my truck here after I was in an accident, 2 months later they tried returning my truck with overspray outside, inside and somehow in the engine bay. The alignment was off and caused the front tire to rub against the bumper when I turned my wheel. As well as my bumper, my hood weren’t properly installed and caused them to shake when exceeding 55mph.
I informed the manager Kelly or Chelsey but they informed that the over spray is my fault and everything else was done correctly.
After leaving my truck for a second time, the “mechanic” told me he could fix my alignment, and I quote “I can fix it in 20 minutes”
A month later still having the same issue.
Caliber Collision is refusing to work with me but that’s fine, my insurance is still fighting to get this resolved.
The only good thing about Caliber collision is that they still give people with intellectual disabilities a chance to work.
But don’t expect them to properly fix your vehicle< /text>

My car was backed into while parked outside of my house,  I took it to Calliber for a new door and paint.  When I got home I noticed a chip in the new door with sharp metal.  I also noticed 2 rough patches on a completely different side from the repair, and 2 small dents.  I called and sent pictures, went in and Justin, the manager completely denied responsibility.  Quote “I don’t know how I am responsible for your paint failure.”  They fixed the paint, but no one ever took ownership of causing the damage and never apologized, he offered me a Starbucks gift card so that I wouldn’t take their customer service survey.</Text>

Caliber was very professional and they did an excellent job at fixing my bumper when I was hit by a run away tire on the freeway. Gieco suggested them when I filed my claim and I'm very happy they did. I had such a great experience with them.</Text>

By the time it was done Caliber claimed that there was over 5100.00 in damage and the "assessor" claimed a dent on the hood couldn't have happened in the accident(it absolutely did happen during the accident) resulting in a battle with my insurance company to get fixed.  The hood repair was supposedly going to cost me 1100.00 and a front fender costs about 200.00.  No idea what the other $4000.00 was for other than to grossly over charge the insurance and line their pockets.< /Text><Resp>{'time': 1620228720189, 'text': 'Hi Matt Marchetti, thank you for reaching out to Caliber Collision.

< review>
Our truck was hit in front of our house and Geico, the young mans insurance company, suggested Caliber Collision as one of the repair shops they deal with. I am very happy with the work Caliber did on our truck. They kept us informed each step of the way during the repair process and had it ready when they said it would be. I would HIGHLY recommend Caliber Collision to anybody who needs work on their vehicle.</review>

We have used Caliber collision in the past for other vehicles and they have always been great. However this time I feel like my experience went above an beyond what I could have expected. I felt very informed every step of the way and that they were treating my repair needs as much as a priority as I felt it was. No one wants to be without their car and they had it repaired painted and back to me within 3 1/2 business days! Can’t ask for more than that!!! Oh ... and ask for Lizz, she was outstanding to work with : ) she was extremely responsive and no question was too big or too small!<//Review>

<text>Liz, my staff contact, was super helpful, communicative and kind. I felt like she advocated for me while also being very honest with where she had limitations. For example, with a radio issue that insurance said wasn’t from the accident, even though it was. She was able to find someone to get it fixed without it hurting me financially. She also worked closely with my insurance company and didn’t hesitate to follow up with them if I had questions. I was able to text back and forth with her easily. She didn’t just wait till updates happened, she would update me just to let me know things were in progress. Pick up was super flexible too. Overall, absolutely great communication.

The car came back in great shape. It was practically destroyed when I brought it in and they were able to fix it within 2 weeks. They also cleaned out the entire inside and outside of the car. I’m telling you it looked brand new! A great overall experience</text>< Pics>

<Text>I have used this Caliber location multiple times (I’m a good driver, I swear).  Each time I have been treated with kindness and professionalism. The staff was always in communication regarding the status of my vehicle repair and gave me options that would best suit me.

Everything has always been seamless including rental car pick up/drop off, and, dealing with insurance. When I do have questions, they are happy to answer. When something felt ‘funny’ they were happy to take a look the same day and make me feel comfortable. I won’t go anywhere else!  Highly recommend!</Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1594992328872, 'text': "Hi Jessica, thank you for your wonderful comments!

Caliber came through and did an excellent job on my van. Although it had to go back in for minor adjustments, the team was very professional, courteous and accommodating. I appreciate the job well done. Jacquey was our awesome “go to” person who kept us informed of what was going on. Thank you again!</review>

Luckily I have only had to work with this business once, but should the need arise in the future, I will certainly bring my business back. The front staff was very knowledgeable and friendly, and was able to help me with a rental car, which by the way was right next door. My car was ready for me to pick up within the timeframe that I was provided, and the work completed looked as good as new.</review>

We were pleased with the friendly staff as this is a little stressful because we had never had an accident before. They answered all our questions and with some reassurance it helped ease our stress. I appreciate that they ARE wearing masks! Unlike other businesses I have been into recently...I’d definitely recommend family and friends to this specific location. I’m a hard guy to deal with, pretty grumpy and people usually piss me off pretty easily...and Caliber left me smiling on our way out the door. Big thanks to all the staff as you are much appreciated! Stay safe!< /Review>< Pictures>

I was absolutely amazed with the work done on my car.  Caliber Collision went above and beyond the call of duty on my car for sure. My car was fixed properly and detailed when I picked it up. I will in fact recommend my friends and family to have work done at Caliber Collision. Top notch staff and top notch work.. Antelope and Roseville Road Facility is the way to go.<//Review>

Sara and the team are great. I went in the day before leaving on a 10 day vacation and asked Sara if I could leave my truck and pick it up when I came back from vacation. She was happy to do so and updated me by text message as needed. The price was great and after picking up my truck today I am very happy with the work. They made it a very convenient experience for me. I highly recommend them.<//Review>

<review>I had to send my car back 2 times, only for me to still be disappointed in my paint job! AND my chrome was damaged, the manager said " if we decided to fix it" that's NOT how to handle customers whom this place damaged their property. Hopefully they will resolve my issues, but the attitude displayed isn't looking hopeful.</review><date>1580432375069<//date>< name>

Truck sat there for a month before I had to continually call them to get an update, which never was a solid answer. Always a "I'll have so and so call you." Which never  happenedj just like the work on my truck. By the time the ins company called me and the appraiser,the fully charged battery was dead"</Review>

Customer service was great. Timely repair was not great. The finish product was terrible. Absolutely destroyed what my car looked like before any of this. The "detail" they do, before the finished delivery, looks like they hose it down and dry it with paper towels. The interior was left totally dirty, and greasy. The paint on the exterior, has air bubbles in it, contaminates, over spray(like the dripping paint type), missed areas, thin areas, and over all not good at all. They destroyed my side marker light, and a trim peice. I want to know, who did the walk around and released this vehicle to me like this. The paint was beautiful before. My poor corvette will never be the same. I hope to never have to deal with this again.<//review>

Prompt and specific service... my Caliber agent, Alexander, was great about calling me periodically during the stint of my auto repair. He gave me frequent updates throughout and was very good at reaching out to me. He even helped me get settled with the Enterprise rental next door so I could get a loaner while my car was in the shop. I might not choose to use them again because of how far this place is from my work and home, but that's not a mark against the company at all. They treated me well and I'd definitely recommend them to others.</Review>

<text>(I was not the actual customer. my wife Juni Johnson had the appointment on 11-5-16)Outstanding customer service and communication. They are very attentive and took the time to explain every detail of the repair process(not that there are a lot of complicated steps or anything). The Enterprise car rental is connected to their building and made the whole process that much easier. They also have some great amenities as well. Coffee, water, tea, and a popcorn stand with all kinds of flavor toppings that my kid got a kick out of. The staff is kind and warm when you walk in and just as pleasant when answering any questions you have. They are very thorough when walking you through the process as well. All in all I am absolutely pleased with the service there.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

These people did not seem to have our best interest in mind. We felt as though they were trying to get more money out of us and it seemed that they were really high with their estimate. They gave us one estimate, changed it, and then told us that it might end up being even more. They were not very professional, in my opinion. We felt like we were getting robbed. We did not have them fix our vehicle. I would not recommend this place. Get other quotes first.<//Text>

<Text>Worst experience imaginable at the collision center. It took them over a week to fix a rear ended bumper. Forgot to order and replace additional parts that were supposed to be on the bumper, and finally painted a new bumper as if by a spray can - very poor quality. They just happened to be closest ones in the area but I wish I knew them beforehand and so could go to see somebody else. Lost my business time as a result and very disappointed!<//Text>< date>

<Rating>2<//Rating><text>Poor service, apparent staffing or management problems, repeatedly made promises on delivery time and failed to meet them.   NOT RECOMMENDED.

My wife was sideswiped, and we took her car to Golden State because we've used their shop once in the past and it was satisfactory.  We had problems right off the bat, because when the insurance adjuster showed up to assess the damage to the car two days after we brought it in and at the agreed upon time, the shop had failed to tear the car down.  The adjuster had to go back later that day to assess the damage (there was additional damage to the frame underneath, so good that she was able to eventually see it) which meant repairs could not be started that day (a Friday).  We were told by both the insurance adjuster and the shop that they would start repairs on Monday and we would have the car back on Thursday.

On Thursday, our insurance adjuster said the shop had called and due to a small delay we would get the car back on Friday instead.  The shop then called me on Friday and said they had a delay in their paint shop and hadn't even started painting it until the afternoon, so it would not be able to cure and be reassembled until Monday.  Then on Monday they figured out that they had painted the panels the wrong color and the whole painting process had to be redone. They apologized a whole bunch and PROMISED it would be done on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, I had to call the shop because they had not contacted me at 4, and I wasn't even surprised when they said it was still in the paint shop and wouldn't be done until the following day.  I talked to both the guy handling my service, and the shop manager, and both listed things that had gone wrong (they had someone call in sick, they were backed up in their paint shop, they had issues with other cars that weren't related to my car, they didn't identify the painting error until the car had been reassembled and was going through their QC process) and they apologized plenty, but couldn't make it right (they offered a free wash and wax, which just made me laugh) and couldn't even promise it would be ready to pick up the following day.

Bottom line is this shop continually disappointed me, made promises then broke them, and seems to have absolutely NO SENSE OF URGENCY AT ALL, and I haven't even got the car back yet.  I will never, EVER bring my business here again.</text>< pictures>

Hacks. My paint is covered in sand scratches, swirls, and there's a big run on my bumper. On top of that, the gaps in between my panels were uneven and my door was hard to open because of it. I took it back to them to fix it, but there's even deeper scratches that have gone through the paint now and the run is still there. My husband is so upset about the quality. It's like they assume I don't know what I'm looking at. The Geico adjuster tried saying my broken tail light was unrelated even though it was right where my car was hit. I had to fight tooth and nail to get that replaced. Completely unacceptable. I wouldn't recommend this shop to my worst enemy.< /Text>

<text>I'm not surprised at all to see I'm not the only former technician to write a review here. This is the only shop I've worked at where we all agreed that there's no way any of us would bring our own vehicle here for repair.

I went into this gym today to sign up for the month. The young lady at the counter called the manager on the phone and when she returned she told me she couldn't help me and didn't give me any other options. The only reason I wanted only a month is because I live Bi-coastal and I'm in the area only 3 months out of the year. I would have signed up for the year if she gave me the option and would have paid in full. I wanted to pay cash and didn't want to put a card on file. She allowed me to walk out and I drove 2 minutes down the street to Fitness19 and guess what? The guy at the counter said I could sign up for the month. Because he gave me that option I ended up signing up for the year and paid in full at that moment. GOOD JOB POWERHOUSE! Allowing money to walk out the door.<//review>

The gym itself  is good. Parking just sucks during their peak hours.

I went to the gym at 0800 yesterday (5/3). I drove around the parking lot 3 times with no luck for parking. I really wish they had a second parking area as I dont want or feel comfortable parking my car on the street n the back or on the side of the gym. Ruined my day because I wasnt able to workout.< /review>

<text>Great outdoor gym to get a workout in during the pandemic. They’ve done a fantastic job replicating the indoor facilities, providing plenty of sanitizing stations, music, shade, and lights. The front desk staff, Caesar and Dylan in particular, are friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend this location if you live in the area!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dc9dedb2c2ee09:0x35519d575a92440c</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Found this place after LA Fitness closed down in March.  I cancelled LAF months and months ago.  This place has it all...indoors and outdoors...open all the time, close to home, clean, nice friendly staff, basketball court...all in all, great place to workout.< /review>

Careful signing with this gym they tell you no cancellation fee and when you want to cancel they want to charge you because they say you need to give a 30 day notice.  Which they decided not to tell you this when signing up.<//review>

The moment you step inside the powerhouse, the Enegry in the gym is amazing. You see amazing people bettering them self and pushing their limits. All the members are extremely nice and welcoming. The Owner does an outside job at keep the equipment clean and working perfectly

As I was doing a set, he noticed noise from the equipment and immediately started to take a look at it. Another example, their were fixing the quat rack immediately and take care of it. The staff is always saying "HI" with big great smiles. Their always wiping the machines down consistently, put weight back and just keep the gym clean and fresh.

I couldn't beg touch on all the amenities the gym has to offer.

I would recommend you check out the gym your self and experience the great atmosphere & Energy.< /text>< pics>

I froze my account because I was pregnant yet it kept being charged. I called once and they refunded it. The next month it happened again, so I called and they said the manager would call me after he looked into it. He never called. I called back and spoke to a very rude employee who said he left a note saying that it was only frozen for two months....not true. I told the employee this and she said okay well I'll have him call you. Right. I was charge an over draft fee because of their screw up two months in a row and now I am cancelling my membership because the won't make it right and their terrible customer service.</review>

Great gym that I have visited 4-5 times a week since March.
Registration was easy and pricing was competitive.
Equipment all works with the exception of a couple of treadmills occasionally.
Everything is kept really clean by a hardworking team.
Gym is never above 50% capacity and staff is always kind.

I enjoy this gym and will continue coming back.</review>

Gym facilities are extensive and inclusive for all types of work outs.  5 stars to a well kept, clean and welcoming environment.

Did you ask about trainers?  5 Stars to Cindy Santos.  She teaches an amazing load of classes and with an enthusiasm that is infectious and makes you think you are having a party instead of working hard. Yes.  She is that good.</text>

<Text>If I could do negative stars I would.  If you ever move or need to cancel your membership start a year in advance.  They come up with excuse after excuse of why the cancellation didn’t process correctly.  I’m the end you pay for a lot of time you never used.  The gym passes the fault to their billing company and the billing company blames the gym.</Text>< pictures>

I really like this gym but the basketball court needs a little TLC, cleaning of the floor around the equipment and chairs would be nice on a regular basis.< /Text>

Tried bringing my weekend guest, but I was off by 2 minutes and they said they would only allow it if he paid. Disgusting business practice by Powerhouse go to any other gym in the area I would suggest Fitness 19. These guys only care about money read any other review it is usually about members being scammed by fine print in their contracts.</Text>

<Review>I checked out the other gyms in the area and chose Powerhouse for the following reasons: the pool is exceptional, the ladies locker room is well stocked and maintained, the classes are great,  staff is pleasant and always available to help, and when I had an issue with my account the manager (Reese) went above and beyond to ensure my utmost satisfaction. I highly recommend!< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1570038632368, 'text': 'Thanks so much Jackie!'}< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dc9dedb2c2ee09:0x35519d575a92440c< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We've been coming to powerhouse gym in Menifee for over a year now. I was skeptical about bringing my kids into the kids club especially being that they were only 4 and 1 at the time, but we've had nothing but a great experience. I would highly recommend it to anyone that lives in the area. Kathy and Madeline make my children feel right at home which is great!< /Review>

<text>Went to cancel membership, I was told by rep I could cancel anytime with 30day notice. Come to find out, they signed me up for a min of one year. Not allowed to cancel without paying $70 in fees. RIP OFF!!!!!
This is why gyms memberships have a bad reputation I their industry. Make sure you read ALL the fine print if you sign up. They will tell you whatever it takes to get your money. Unfortunately I probably would have rejoined when I was ready, no way now. Not this place!!<//text></record></dataset><record>

Went to try the gym out for a day with the free guest pass and Reese kept trying to charge me $15.  Rediculous that they he wouldn’t even let me try the gym out when it clearly said online that you can sign up for a free guest pass. Go to La fitness, it is way nicer anyway< /Text>

At first this place seemed great. The equipment was clean, people were friendly, and overall just a nice place. After a few months though, I decided to cancel my subscription since I sadly became a bit lazy. So I went ahead and called them to cancel and they said I was in a year contract! What! During my initial signing they said I could cancel ANYTIME but nope. They will lock you in for a year of paying. Once my year came up I figured well that’s it finally I’m out but NO! They charged me again the following month! I paid 13 months! This place will contract SCAM you be careful! I was finally able to call the financial company who handles the membership and cancel today. Thank God. DO NOT SIGN UP HERE.<//Text>

<review>I went to this gym location for a while to test it and to see if it was my permanent (It didn't end up staying my gym). I will say that the pool, sauna, and cardio areas are great! However,where they are lacking is the weights and machine area. Don't get me wrong. They have a ton of free weights, and their machines usually work, but everything is out of date. I feel like it needs a bit of a revamp, and the outside sign or "banner" should be fixated somewhere less awkward.</review><response>{'time': 1559240826814, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback!

< Review>
Where to begin? Lets start with membership price.  It definitely is super affordable as I am paying 49.99 for a membership of two people. They have a variety of classes from aquatic to zumba and provide a detailed schedule print out indicating the days, times and what instructor will be giving the class for the day. Love how they have sanitary wipes near almost every machine station to wipe down after use. They gym is always clean and for some reason even though there are plenty of sweaty people it never has that musty stench that usually other overcrowded gyms do.  They have a good variety of machines to use for every workout need you may have.  Every single staff member I have came across is always very courteous, helpful and friendly.  I have been a member of different gyms but by far this one has been just the right one. I would definitely recommend it!  Almost forgot to mention that the gym does provide   child care for a fee.<//Review>

Love the gym been coming here for more than a year now.... But, I rate this place 3 stars because... The sauna is never working -1star and the new girl (heavier set and black hair with dark blondish ends) on nights is terrible doesn't greet and when you try to wave bye or say bye she ignores you and just watches her laptop -1star. Just today on 1/6/18 at about 0146 HRS someone attempted to say bye and she just kept watching her laptop. Other than that love this gym still!!! Just won't be coming at nights anymore vibe is killed the moment I walk in now</Review>

Great place to workout literally anytime! Place is clean and the machines are well maintained. If I had to complain it would be about the wifi, if you have to stream make sure its included in your data package.<//Text>

Gym is usually very clean and staff is professional and polite. 4 stars instead of 5 because occasionally papertowel/wipes dispensers are empty and gym equipment could use a little updating. But all in all a very good gym.</text>

Once I was hung up on, once I was told to call back and speak to the district manager who never showed up or called me back, and most recently I spoke with Zach, the club manager who specifically told me he would take down my phone number and email address and help me cancel my membership. He also told me he would get me in touch with the gym owners to help me process a request for refund of the three months of membership that I have been charged for and didn't use because I have moved out of state. I has been hung up on, forgotten about, and poorly treated enough. I want something to be done about this very poor customer service I have been experiencing and want my refund of unused membership dues for the past three months, or I will take any and all legal power within my control to get my money back. This is borderline stealing and it needs to stop now!<//review>< Pictures>

<text>We came to this fitness to try it for couple months and stated to sales representative that we don't need any obligation, we might not like it, she said no problem ,that you have no cancellation fee and can cancel any time, now when we decided to cancel they show our initialled contract that state that we have to stick to this gym for whole year. Tried to talk to manager ,got incredibly impatient and rude response.
If you are looking for good vibes and young faces, look further.

Joined the gym over the summer until I returned to school where a gym was provided for in the tuition, and was informed once the summer was over I could cancel no problem. Once I returned to school I went to cancel my membership and was given a card with a number who I could talk to about this. I called this number and was told I had signed a years contract with the gym and could not cancel without extra fees. Facilities were decent, staff was average at best but cannot get over being lied to and being forced to wait a year or face additional charges. Never going back.</Review>

Steam room ALWAYS broken. Half their treadmills are broken. Weights? Good luck finding them. No one cleans equipment after use. Another heavy bag breaks once a month. They're down to two.. Tanning beds are only in use during the day. Staff is nice though not their faults the owners don't care..</Review>

<Text>Nice facility, very busy and very hard to get into scheduled classes. Tried three times to get into a class and was unsuccessful.
Unfortunately how they conduct their business is very underhanded and miss-leading. I agree to sign a contract based information they provided me. They told me it would be nor problem to cancel as I was only living there temporarily.  This was not true. They have consistently denied to cancel my membership even though they "promised' me it would not be a problem.

I would not recommend them nor would I believe what they promise.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Decent Gym but they make getting out of the contract a huge hassle. Even though my contract is up apparently it states somewhere that you have to supply a 30 day written notice in order to cancel a roll over month to month agreement with them. I was told I have to pay for an extra month past my contract that I won't be using because I called on the 4th of September. I now have to pay for all of October. They refused to prorate the fee or work with me in any way. Also had to call a third party. The gym doesn't handle this themselves and the email has to have certain details and information. Very unhappy that they feel the need to suck money out of people. Fulfilling my year contract isn't enough to allow me to leave a happy customer? BS
Also, My husband had payed for this gym last year and was double charged the first month. He immediately decided to cancel< /Text>

Not a bad place. It's 24hrs, it has decent equipment, and it's near me. Everything I want in a gym.</Review>

<Review>I've been going to Powerhouse now for a month.
Pros: Very Service friendly. My brother is active duty army on leave for the holidays and they gave him a free pass for two weeks. I guess this is an active deal for all service members coming home for the holidays, so thumbs up. Briana and Andrew were a big help.
It's never truly crowded like a Fitness 19 and there are plenty of machines and equipment to use.
Cons: Treadmills occasionally break down in various ways but it's to be expected. It's a gym. Only thing I'd suggest is maybe mark the barbells better to distinguish weights, but that is such an insignificant con that I do not hold it against the place.<//Review>< rating>

My wife and I have been with this gym for years. The variety and availability of classes is great. Our kids enjoy the family swim. The whole gym is always very clean and the instructors are fun. Wish the Kids Club has cardio for the kids rather than just toys and games but that's about it.< /review>

Pretty good classes, but beware of Ingrid. She does not really explain her course accurately. I went to her ripped class today and she was wearing a thong with stretchy leggings. I felt very uncomfortable, and I feel that is very disrespectful for an instructor to wear a thong during instruction and visible to everyone< /review>

It’s been half a year that I don’t go they still charge me,  before this I informed them I wasn’t able to go anymore and I would do what ever it takes to cancel the membership the lady was rude and came to the conclusion it is impossible to cancel. (SMH) Ridiculous!! I’m screwed, Responding to owner: yeah cancel my membership and stop taking my money!< /Text>

The gym itself is ok. The 24 hour schedule is very convinient. However I'm not sure who is responsible for cleaning because the bathrooms aren't very clean at all. Especially the toilets. Clean the bathrooms regularly and it's a very good gym.</text>

<Date>1545548966620<//Date><rate>3< /rate><Review>The buttons for speed on the treadmills aren't the best. You can't quickly move from let's say speed 4 to 8 quickly. Some have a number pad that you can use to switch the speeds quickly. Some treadmills that have that function work others don't and makes it difficult if your trying to do a high intensity workout. Free weights are good. Plenty of benches. Squat rack is good. But need more of them. Need more leg press machines too. Showers are good. Lockers. Plenty of those. Pool is nice. Water tastes just as bleh as the one in San Jacinto. If your trying to do a wide variety of workouts your better off going to the one in San Jacinto. Plenty of machines there. Free weights a plenty. Leg press machines are good. Treadmills definitely better there. Although idk I feel like sometimes when your running they get stuck for a second at both locations. Someone comes to fix them but then after not to long they get stuck again. Idk. Small gripes I guess. Over all still better than 24"hr fitness. Or fitness 19</Review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1549052219468, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to write this review!   We always appreciate the feedback.'}< /response>< GmapID>

Chill atmosphere but what I'd like to see more of is free range equipment like sleds, assualt bikes, rings, etc. Equipment definately needs to be upgraded as well. Bathrooms are always spotless and smell great. Staff is nice as well.< /text>

<review>Called in because I was thinking about canceling my membership at LA fitness. The only thing I wanted was a day pass to try the, gym out to see if I liked the vibe and the equipment. Apparently they just switched to powerhouse fitness and I was told, that it would, be,15 bucks for a single workout. I said no thank you.  A half a month of dues for x one session?  Yet when I went on powerhouse's site they offered gust passes so I called back and talked to some one in the membership department who said, they don't do free trials but they could charge me  10 bucks that could go to a membership.  Again no thank you.  Guessing I'm staying with LA fitness till powerhouse figures out how to run a business<//review><Date>1469838575282<//Date><gmap_id>0x80dc9dedb2c2ee09:0x35519d575a92440c<//gmap_id>< Rating>

Just here to agree that the cancellation policy is ridiculous. Moved across the country, was told my forwarding address letter was enough to confirm relocation on their phone support. However, just got an email saying my forwarding address was not enough and I HAVE to be on a utility bill for the new place.

Considering that I JUST moved in with someone (which should be a very common scenario), of course it will take some time for my name to appear on the utility bill, so I'll have to wait another month at least. That's another $50 payment fee on top of another $50 cancellation fee.

It's just ridiculous I HAVE to add my name to the utility bill for the sake my former gym's billing company. It makes no sense.

Hopefully people will read this and consider before joining.< /review>

The gym isn't bad but their billing company is a joke. Even when your contract is up they need written notice to cancel and a 30 day notice, that way they can extract another monthly payment from you even if you moved. Double charges are common as you have seen on many reviews. All in all I wouldn't sign up here 100% due to ASF payment solutions, they are nothing but a problem.</Review>

Just here to agree that the cancellation policy is ridiculous. Moved across the country, was told my forwarding address letter was enough to confirm relocation on their phone support. However, just got an email saying my forwarding address was not enough and I HAVE to be on a utility bill for the new place.

Considering that I JUST moved in with someone (which should be a very common scenario), of course it will take some time for my name to appear on the utility bill, so I'll have to wait another month at least. That's another $50 payment fee on top of another $50 cancellation fee.

It's just ridiculous I HAVE to add my name to the utility bill for the sake my former gym's billing company. It makes no sense.

Hopefully people will read this and consider before joining.<//Review>

Nice gym but getting out of the contract because of move has been a hassle.   Was told, by owner (because I asked to speak to one) to come into the gym if I moved and they would cancel my membership (sounded very simple and in house)..... that is a lie.  You get turned over to the company who handles your contract.  After digging deeper in your pocket another $50 because you moved and can no longer go to the gym and then paying for an add'l month because it's only fair to continue to pay for what you are not using, you will then be free from it.  Also, make sure you are not on 'Auto-renewal' once your contract expires because that's an issue too.  To be fair, I know most gyms are like this.  They have to make their money and lock you in because they know if it was easy to get out of you would.  lol.</Text>

Nice gym, but they use a terrible billing company, ASF Payment Solutions. Terrible customer service. They have kept billing me months after I am no longer a customer there even though I have given them all the paperwork they have asked for (lots of annoying paperwork). Do not let them have access to your checking account for automatic payments. I'm still trying get them to stop billing me for my family of four. I recommend not using Menifee Fitness until they use a different billing company or they handle it in house. It's a very nice gym, but it has been a huge mistake for our family. If they make it right by reimbursing me for the months since I moved out of the area I will update my rating.</review>

***BEWARE*** I gave this place 5 stares before, but after what happened today I have to give it -1!! I guess it's NOT OK to workout with friends and share the same machine without being accused of training someone. The owner of the gym took it append herself to make false claims about my friend and I, and made no attempt to apologize is unacceptable!! Mind you, there are other groups of people working out together and sharing the same machine EVERYDAY!!!  I AM NOT PLEASED AND I WOULD ADVISE OTHERS TO TAKE THEIR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE!!</Text>

<text>Staff is rude. I always see the cleaners talking with their friends and cursing out loud, very unprofessional. Recently they took away the towels and blamed it on the "drought" but continues to waste endless amounts of water in steam rooms and surrounding landscapes. People who work out here are extremely inconsiderate and always making obnoxious grunting noises.I can't wait to leave this place once LA fitness opens up. This place is going in the wrong direction.</text>< pics>

<Text>Menifee 24 was an amazing GYM; I don't know if they changed their name or sold it; but, Houston we have a problem. I paid off my 3-yr contract happily with Menifee 24. The contract provided me with amazing staff and an awesome fitness environment! The people at the front desk were always happy to assist me and remembered my name. So as I said very happy to give this place my money; however, due to financial hardship I did not renew my membership. My membership ended in May or June of this year; so imagine my surprise when I get an email telling me my 58.00  monthly fee with Power House Menifee was declined 11/9/16! I never renewed my contract nor did I agree to a new one with Power House Menifee! I replied to the email from ABC Financial Services, Inc. and told them, I am no longer a member with Menifee 24, nor have I ever been a member of Power House Menifee and to remove me from their billing immediately. Well here it is 9 days later and I am getting another email saying my "cancellation notice" is accepted but, I still owe 58.00 bucks. I called ABC Financial Services, INC.; I will not divulge the representatives name because not only was this rep polite and helpful. She does not control what PHM does, she helps them get their money; bottom line, she was doing her job. Anyway, she tells me, "you may want to pay this any ways because if you don't, it will go to collections then on your credit and we do not want that." This sparks a little flame in me but, again this is not the reps or ABCs fault; the fault lies with Power House Menifee. So I call PHM; no surprise there when I am then told by Cesar that the girl I need to speak to is not in today but will be in tomorrow. Hannah is who I am to speak with tomorrow.... I signed up with Hannah in 2013 and as I said before at that time and all the way till the end of my membership I couldn't have been happier. I cannot believe that after a 4-5 month gap of ending my membership that this gym would suddenly start me on a month to month membership with out my knowledge or consent and had my old Visa Debit card number on file, charge my account again with out my knowledge or consent! I will never use this gym ever after what they just pulled! I cannot believe this company would do something this dirty; they can't find a way to contact me about my "membership", yet their billing company has my email address to send me payment demands, interesting isn't it? These people did not earn my trust let alone deserve it. I have contacted my lawyer as a precaution if Hannah and PHM do not resolve this. Because I am pretty sure you cannot start up memberships or services with out my signing a contract for new said services/memberships.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< userid>

Of course its not like the old gym. NEW OWNERS! NEW PROCEDURES! Give them time everything will come around.

Like any contract, read it please before you sign! You have money coming out of your bank account, why would you not want to read it! Your not going to sign your name on the dotted line before you buy a car. So why would you do it for a gym membership! C'mon!

Its simple, if you want to pay a dollar to join and $10.00 a month after that  you are locked on to a year contract. So pay a little extra and go with the month to month option that is explained to you during the sign up.

Okay, now about the gym.
-The staff that i deal with are good to go. Young kids but they know the regulars. They clean and re-rack weights do what they have to do for the customers.
-The gym equipment is all in really good shape. If something breaks they have it fixed fairly quickly.

-The Men's locker room/bathroom is not really maintained. Its always dirty and out of paper towels and toilet paper. Showers smell and curtains defiantly need to be replaced. But what can i say. Its a bathroom. Toilets flush and showers work. I am good personally, its just my opinion.

-The vibe is great. This gym is defiantly a gym that everyone is welcome at. No judgmental people. (During the times that i am their i cant speak for the other 22 1/2 hours i am not their.

- The trainers defiantly don't look or act like trainers hard for me to see any confidence in their abilities. They kind of look like individuals that got their certificate and found a job for personal training. Once again my opinion. I have never dealt with them personally this opinion is based of perception. I wouldn't pay for it.

-I haven't done any of the classes so couldn't comment on those.

-i don't use the pool, basketball court or racket ball court so couldn't comment on those.

-The cardio equipment is all in really good shape. They have everything you will need. Even a movie cardio room for those days you just want to come in and keep your mind off your cardio session with something other then your music.

Things that I would like to see change. The music that plays on the loud speakers is really bad. Yes i can use my headphones and listen to my own music but i really don't like to work out with headphones in. I like to focus on my mind muscle connection. The music is my only complaint.

Once again, these are my opinions. I really like it here and would defiantly recommend this gym to all my peer's. I am really excited to see the future of this gym when everything is squared away!

I hope this helps people out with there choice.

Thank you!< /text><rating>5< /rating>< user>

Told them to cancel my Annual Contract at the End to the Year which coincided with the Federal Fiscal Year (October 1 - September30)
Then get billed by ASF for FY17 on October 1.

Then ASF said you have to work that through PowerHouse Gym.
PowerHouse Gym said you NEEDED to Contact ASF to Stop.
Of Course they sure did not say that in September when  I told them I was not continuing me ANNUAL Contract.
Good Luck</text>< Pictures>

And I love the way the gym is actually set up. Also, customer service has been good to me. I have only been going here for 3 weeks but Im pretty happy... I see a lot of reviews bout double payments being drafted.... hoping thats just an error with their account will update rating if they try to play with my money.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

It's a good little gym. Everything you need for a great work out is available, and the basketball is a added bonus.</Review>

Good variety of machines to choose from. However, maintenance on the machines is pretty sad and keeping the place clean seems to be impossible for the staff to do.</review>

SERIOUSLY DO NOT JOIN. TRYING TO CANCEL THIS f****G CONTRACT IS STRESSFUL AS F***. THEY ASK FOR ALL KINDS OF SH** AND THEN THEY DENY YOUR REQUEST WHEN YOU DO EXACTLY AS THEY WANT. THEY CANT EVEN SIMPLY EMAIL YOU BACK TO LET YOU KNOW. GYM IS GOOD BUT EVERYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH YOUR PAYMENT AND ACCOUNT IS BULLSH**. AND SHADY.</text>

Went to check the gym out and maybe get a membership but change my mind within 5 minutes not only was the staff very rude, but they wanted to charge me 15 dollars to try out the gym for one single day! This place has very poor customer service is all I got to say..< /Review>

Unbelievably the worst business ever run. Beware of double withdrawals and stay on top of your bank records even after you cancel your membership. I'm only giving it a one star because I can't do half.</Review>

Have been calling Recology to just put a number on the bin. I've called 3 times and left 1 voicemail. In spite of it, they drop a new (not literally new) bin, again without a number. I stay in an apartment and everyone's bin has their apartment number so that when each resident keeps their bin in, they know which is theirs.

The representative states "you can paint the number on your own". I have to buy paint and a brush to do the job which they are supposed to do?

Every time I'm promised that the number will be put on the bin and every time it's been a failure.

My issue is not resolved yet. Will call again tomorrow.

Worst customer service ever!<//text>

For Construction debris good prices. It could be better  but they know the best. $40 per cubic yard (May 2018).<//Text>

It seems like a no brainier that they need the call back service for extended hold times. Peoples time is too precious to wait in hold for such a long time for something that has been paid for. No wonder people just dump items on random streets.<//Text>< Pictures>

The Recology online website service request does not work.  I put in an online request 3 months ago to downsize our service from 64 gallons to 32 Gallons.  I received a confirmation email back.  3 months later i still have the 64 gallon container and bills for 64 gallon containers.   I called them, they acknowledged that I did put in the online service change request, but that I would still have to pay for the 64 gallon service.< /Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Reference,: very poor response and not professional service address at 960 Roble av. Menlo Park
They missed the collection of garbage and recycle last week Wednesday.
This is  four unit apartment  at 960 Roble av. Menlo Park. We left messages on Thursday 4 times and talked in person on Friday but no response and no action and today, Monday,tne phone is busy all day long.
Our garbage is badly overflowed after Thanksgiving and very unsanitary for the health.
Some how I have to call them for the missed collection very often. Whenever new driver or substitute driver assignment, these things happened.
They are very good in collecting the payment and
rate increase and bad service and no response.
Flood of complain from tenant.

I put the car oil next to the blue bin inside of our residential area (we don’t take the blue bins to the curbside), but the driver did not pick it up. I called to the recology and was told that I need to take it to the curbside for a free pick-up. I took it to the curbside, but some of our neighbors moved it, and the oil was not collected on that day. I called again to the recology and was told that the oil needs to be on the curbside next Wednesday when the trash is picked up, so I placed it there. The driver did not take it again on Wednesday. I called again, and was told that it needs to be placed by the blue bins inside the residential area, not on the curbside!!! I inquired about scheduling a free pick up, and I was told no, the pick up is not free. The lady told me she would put a note for the driver to collect on on Wednesday. The driver did not pick it up today. It is all very unprofessional for people at the recology give me contradictory information and don’t do their duties.</text>

On the other hand, I feel I owe it to them to comment on how easy and friendly they have been to work with, whether calling to schedule a bulk pickup or dropping off at the dump or recycling center. Have never had to wait more than a minute when calling, and always had a friendly person helping on the line. Not many places one can say that about.<//Review>< pictures>

<rate>1< /rate><review>This company is a freaking joke. We leave our trash out every Tuesday and on our security cameras we watch the lazy trash collector grab our recycle bins fill them with trash from the cans to dump. Before they fill the cans the collectors remove garbage bags from our cans and leave them because they say the top on the can must close all the way or they won't take trash. This is BS and Managers need to intervene to keep customer service up if not they are no better then their employees who run with no direction.<//review>< Pictures>

The guys at Ox Mountain in the scale house  that do the estimating of your load are SUPER inconsistent... I usually go in there in a full sized Dodge one ton pickup, and I'm always dumping windows and doors, all stacked up tall, and usually nearly a full load. I'm usually charged for one and a half yards, I think one time it was 2 yards. Today I went there in a rental truck, a Ford F-150 with crew cab (4 doors) and a super short (less than 5 foot) bed. The guy pulls out his tape measure, measures the one door I had standing up in the truck, the rest were all windows. He goes back in the scale house, comes out and charges me for two and a half yards! My old truck had an 8 foot bed, and I've gone in there with WAY MORE than I could have EVER loaded in this rental!

<Text>Free monthly tours of the facility available And at special events like Earth Day and the Rethink Recycling Day.  They had a crepe food truck @ Recycling Day for a free lunch.  And a free raffle for four prizes.  They gave out messenger bags and grocery bags with square shaped bottoms.  Hard to find those anymore.  Doc shredding and eWaste also going on.< /Text>< rate>

I was trying to leave feedback on the Recology site, but didn't find it. So here goes. I had an awesome garbage experience this morning. Friday, 5/13/16 - Burlingame route. I was checking my bins before bringing them in and noticed that a school sign and a small bag of trash was stuck and left in the trash bin. The driver, who was now picking up across the street, must have seen me check my trash. He stopped, crossed the street and offered to take the trash that wasn't emptied earlier. How awesome is that? Thank you and give that guy a raise!!<//Review>

Seriously can't understand why these people can't tell time and pick up garbage at 6am and after like they're legally supposed to. The main office says that they have GPS tracking so they can keep tracking of them and whatnot, but after their nearly half dozenth infraction since Jan.2nd 2016, where they've shown up as early as 4am to do trash pickup, I really don't think the main office really cares how their staff conducts themselves and how they are perceived by the public.Today they showed up before 6am and made monumental amounts of noise, waking me and family up from a deep sleep. So not cool.</Review>

I think they were not so good at first, rather confused/confusing and had some sticker shock over
the fees.  However, the last year or so when I've had occasion to call and make requests, or ask
extra or missed pick-ups they've been very good.  And I've found the people on the phone have been
very courteous, clear and understanding.  I haven't really employed the web site much, so can't comment on that.  Anyway, I think they've improved, which can't be said of a lot of companies/places.< /text>

<Text>I am getting tired of arriving home and cannot get into my driveway because the Recology driver keeps driving and drops the bin in the middle of the driveway entrance. Either that or the bins are dropped down flat with the lids open and sticking out into the street.
Please remind your drivers it is not ok to race down a residential street in a large Recology truck. This happens regularly in the 800 block of San Mateo!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Name>

Their service is inconsistent. In a 2 month period I've had to email them constantly to pick up garbage or recycling for an apartment complex.

*Update* 1/30/19
They're still inconsistent! Still emailing to have the recycling picked up. This ridiculous!<//review>

Absolutely a terrible experience. After waiting in line for half an hour, we were told that they charge you per cubic yard not in weight! So the guy in front just guesses how many cubic feet in your vehicle you have! What a ridiculous concept! Not only that but they charge 3 times what other dumps charge. So what would normally cost you less than $40 anywhere else in the Bay Area, they charge you $135. Even though my client has to pay this bill, I think that everyone should know what a TOTAL RIPOFF this place is. The ONLY good thing about it is that it is open until 6 pm. I'm sure that is because the owner wants to remain open to make more money from the next poor sap that doesn't know that other recycling places charge ways less.</text>

<Text>Garbage bin was very full and had a bag sitting on top of the other trash in the can; driver took it off and left it on the street! And then when I called to have it picked up they wanted to charge an exorbitant fee! And like others have said, if you take it to the transfer station, they'll charge you more than five times what it cost for monthly service!</Text>< gmapID>

On Friday they forgot to pick up our recycling. I called on Monday and was surprised when a human answered the phone. I told her what had happened and she sent a truck to my house. They got there 14 minutes after I placed my call. 14 minutes! Great service!< /Review>

Over the years there has been very few instances when there is a breakdown in the trash in the trash pick up but  in which, when I called up,the oversight was corrected promptly.This happened again on Monday,April 21,only the blue container was not emptied.When I called the following day,someone  someone came soon after.
Overall I am pleased and satisfied with the service.<//review>

I just had the best customer service ever from Recology- a young woman went out of her way to help me while I am moving- I hope she has lots of really good luck/karma coming her way for the rest of the year  :-)< /text>

<text>What a scam they have going here. $70.00 to drop off a couch and loveseat. The couch wasnt even worth half of that AND you unload it yourself. Now I see why people dump their furniture on the streets. I guarantee thats what i will do next time.</text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<text>This is a Badminton/Volleyball place with good coaching for reasonable prices, front staff here are very helpful and are ready to go the extra mile. Monthly subscription for badminton is 40$, black sole shoes are not allowed that is the only shoe restriction.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dbf72236e76769:0x7b173b00d74460e7< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This place may not be in the best condition, but their coaching here is great. My daughter played here for a few years, but moved clubs to become more competitive. She was really sad when it was her final day, with her growing so much in this club. This place is a little better with little ones, I would suggest to move to a different club as your child is growing older. This place was amazing. Even I was sad to leave because of the coaching. Personally, I have played 20 years of lacrosse.  I don't have the slightest idea about volleyball, but I have seen my daughter get better from this club. I don't look at conditions much. I see complaints about the area, but it's the coaching to me that matters.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>There are several fitness based businesses in this building. Martial Arts, Volleyball, TRX/Spin, weight lifting, etc. The walls don't go all the way to the ceiling so it can get noisy when there are several classes/events going on at once. Still, a nice gym. Unfortunately, it gets HOT in the summer.< /Text>< Pictures>

Set off the street in a plain industrial park style area, the San Diego Volleyball Club is a large facility with 4 full courts, trampoline area, gymnastics spring floor, and weight training area.

We enrolled in a starter skills class for our 10yo girl.  The class is about 25 girls and there is one main instructor with a handful of helper instructors.  The instruction is fun, friendly, and focused on building basic ball handling skills for the girls.  During our class the girls will run between all 4 courts, hitting, scooping up their ball, then running to the next station.

There is plenty of parking in front and around the building, although the white lines have long faded so I'm never sure if I'm parked right.  The facility is clean, ample parent seating in various areas, a snack bar that is probably only open during tournements, and *free WIFI.*   Bathrooms are large and clean.  Each volleyball court is surrounded with netting so no stray balls.

Word from other parents is that the instructors will let us know when our girl has achieved enough skills to try out for the team.

Of note, there is no real "front desk" area with someone there watching over things or the front door.  But I'm always eyeballs-on my kids anyway.< /review>

<review>As a parent of a child who grew up with this club. It is with great sadness I write this review.

My daughter has played and coached at this club for 14 years.   The condition of this club is pathetic.    SDVBC has been unable to move  into the future as many of the other clubs have.    The management/ owner has treated my daughter poorly in the past as a player and an employee.  Now after she has moved on to a different club, employees are calling and harassing her accusing her of poaching players that have left.   The club assumes no responsibility for the continuos exodus of talent instead they blame any coach who has ever left there    My suggestion is they look within to how they can improve their product and stop blaming others for the decline of their status.<//review>< username>

Easy to see each court play, unlike Epic. However, no ventilation, no AC, not even a bloody fan. This place is just a sauna.<//review>

We can only speak for our experience with the high school locals girls program. My daughter enjoyed the friends she made and everything the coaches taught her. The coaches are patient and take the time to show the players skills they need to succeed. James, Chris, Stewart, and Miles all worked with the HS locals teams.

The locals program is a really great program if your daughter is just starting out or just need to stay active in the off season and you don't want to spend an arm and a leg on travel team costs. Thanks, SDVBC for such a great program. 😊</text>

Love Grocery Outlet. You never know what you'll find. With that being the case, sometimes you can't get what you're specifically after; still a great place though going in knowing that. Cheap too!<//text>

Shop here 1st! Save yourself a lot of money. I first shop here to get all I can cheap, then get all the items I couldn't get here at a full priced store. I usually avoid perishables, but the meat is good, and the fruits and vegetables are great. I found being choosy on expiration dates is wise.<//Review>

<text>This place is usually pretty clean and the staff is usually kind. There is one manager at night who is off putting and somewhat rude to the other staff. Also they say they are open till nine but ask people to make their final purchases at 8:30. They do have a pretty good selection and the shelves are always full. As far as pricing goes they are pretty average for a grocery outlet.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<text>I like Grocery Outlet they have pretty much most of the stuff that I need. They're less busy than other stores. They do rotate some of their products so it's not always the same thing every time. But I do like their produce.</text></record></dataset><record>

Midway market a very pleasant convenience store decently priced very good staff get you in and out as fast as they can so they don't drag you down if you're on 273 between Anderson and Redding I recommend if you want something to drink or snack that's the place you should stop.< /Review>

<review>Worst experience because of Covid times we are watching every penny. Retired etc. so what a great deal we thought we would be for the two of us a turkey good brand etc. saw the deal for a turkey, $12 off if you spend over 30.00. So we buy our groc $80. Worth and we are told that turkey we have is not the one they said, but Jen 00 is the brand. They say oh if it’s a frozen one same brand same size not fromFrozen. No frozen  left. Very technical and uncaring - left without a Turkey< /review>< Name>

Great deals on some higher end products, but you have to pick and choose based on the expiration dates. Lots of stuff just about to expire here, some stuff already has. Not a good place to stock up as most of it has a very short shelf life. Hints the great deal.< /Review>

<Review>The stock rotates, so you can't rely on getting the same products from week to week, but there always some good deals to be had, so making a plan to stop in at least once per week is usually rewarding.

<review>There was a gentleman by the name of Lucas who deserves a 5 star rating.  There are not May young people that was as kind, polite, and helpful and a hard worker.

This is what brings me to the Anderson grocery outlet is because of him.

The lady in front of me spoke with his manager and just shook her head.  When an employee has a 5 star rating or just a good repor from the public to the manager they should acknowledge that and at least give the customer something to write a good review

Thank you Lucas for setting a great example for the employees to follow and always have such a good positive at work.

I hope this lands on his file so they really know what a good employee he truly is</review><response>None<//response>< user_id>

New building is nice, but the prices increased when they moved.  If I am going to pay full price, might as well do all my shopping at one store.</text>

Place is becoming a staple in the stores to shop at.  Pretty good selection and some unique items too. Sometimes the bagged produce isn’t the best but always a good value and selection for a smaller store.<//text>

<review>The only 2 times I've been there when I was next in line a relief checker came up and asked the people behind me to move to the checkstand she was opening. 2 different times, 2 different employees and neither of them thought to take the person who was truly next in line. Both times I had less than 4 items too where the customers they grabbed had full carts. Let's train your employees to not just grab the closest person but to look at the line and say to everyone "I can help the next person in line over on checkstand X". Or go around to the checker side and look and make eye contact to ask the person who was waiting the longest personally.< /review>< Name>

I really like the daily emails I get every morning with their top deals of the day.  You can also enter into the drawing (monthly or weekly, not sure). To win a gift card for the amount you saved by shopping each time you shop there.<//Text>

<Review>They constantly discriminate against ebt card holders. Watched them smash not only my groceries whilst being stingy what is supposed to be free bags, bags that are paper and aren't even supposed to have a charge, but also smashed all of the groceries belonging to a sensior citizen paying with ebt. WILL be filing a discrimination lawsuit as well hiring a PI to investigate their store.< /Review>< Time>

Great place, with great owners. Employees are kind, and full of diversity.  Looking for good produce at a good price? Look no further.  There is health food, snacks, lawn and garden, vitamins, and much more.< /text>

<Rating>3</Rating><Review>Check out was bad, not many customers,  all lanes open, but cannot tell because Store too bright to see lane open light is on. Also, one lane as I try to get to it, cashier comes out in front of it and just starts jaw jacking with friends, like she had nothing to do. So I had to get in a line behind 3 others in a different lane, taking a good 5 minutes extra if my time. Then as she goes back to her register she glances and sees my two items are on the counter, so instead of asking me to come around to her register she goes and gets somebody else to check out. I only had 2 items, lady in front of me only 1, and our clerk was still checking out somebody else.<//Review>< Pics>

This store just opened in August, 2017.  It is a nice, clean store with discounted groceries and home items like cleaning and laundry supplies, beauty and over the counter medicine items, and fresh produce, meats, dairy and deli items.  They have new items every time I go in there.< /review>

This is a nice store although it is much smaller than I anticipated.  The prices I saw were somewhat comparable to Wal Mart or WinCo.  Some items a little cheaper and some higher.  For what I normally buy this is not the store I would go to.  When I checked out today it was about $18 and she told me I saved $28.  I don't know what they were comparing it too but it was ridiculous.  Even Safeway would not have cost me $28 more and they are the highest store in town.  My grandson and wife like this store very much as they are trying the vegan route and said this store has a lot of items they buy.  Sorry I can't say more good about this store but I am sure there will be a lot of people who are very pleased with it.  I will go there occasionally but it will not be a regular stop.< /text>

Used to shop here weekly until the cashier was so rude and the manager was even ruder! Have not been back for over 6 months! I go to redding or red bluff ! Very sad since they are so close! But won’t give my business to those who are disrespectful!!!<//Review>
