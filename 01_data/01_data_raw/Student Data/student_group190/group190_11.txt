I get tattooed on the same block as Aloha Fresh. I had an appointment yesterday afternoon and made it down from Sonoma county pretty early and needed something to eat beforehand. I ordered online and by the time I walked in it was ready. Customer service was excellent and helpful.
There is one poke place where I live that is pretty decent, and I’ve gone to another poke place in Evergreen that is also pretty good but the poke I had yesterday from this spot was unmatched. Everything was so fresh and delicious. Upon reading other reviews this is true, Hawaiian style poke and I’m hooked. Looks like I’ll be coming here every time I am in the area :)</Text>

<review>This weekend they had a special for mochi poi. These are really hard to come by. Half dozen for $5. We really couldn’t miss out. The food here is amazing and we will be back again pretty soon.

As you can see.. we ate one mochi poi before this photo was taken lol.<//review><rate>5</rate>< gmap_id>

I swore that Santo Market was the best poke, but Aloha Fresh makes me question myself. They are owned by a Hawaiian staff and serve top quality poke. The best part is that they try to stay as traditional as possible while still appealing to people who haven't had real Hawaiian poke.

I find myself going there at least once a week and always get the Poke Lover with Hawaiian Ahi, Spicy Ahi, crab salad, and ocean salad.

This might be the best poke spot outside of Hawaii 🤔</text>

< review>
The only poke place in the bay that brings me back to Hawaii. Good quality fish, excellent flavors. None of the excessive random fillers that other “build your own poke bowls” have, and no awkward texture pieces of fish. Just pure delicious poke & hot rice - exactly like Hawaii :) they also sell poke by the pound, other hot Hawaiian foods, and Hawaiian snacks. If we lived closer, we’d definitely be coming more often! Even still, it’s worth a 30 min drive whenever I need my Hawaiian poke fix.

To top it off, staff are friendly & portions are huge- I couldn’t finish my bowl even after going on a hike and only having eaten a granola bar earlier! (Unlike those other poke places that fill the bowl with rice or salad, aloha fresh loads you up on what actually matters- the poke & equally delish sides!)< /review>

Delicious and fresh poke bowls. $15 for a really small size. The portion is so small that I'd never finished a poke without rice and salad remaining on the bottom. The rice and salad are so so so much lesser than others. I only saw a few greens lying in my bowl. Don't know why they give so small amount of rice and veggies when they have such good proteins and sides. Maybe I'll go for somewhere else instead.</text>

<review>Straightforward delicious island-style, not LA-style, poke bowls (think limu and kukui nut instead of hot cheetos and jalapeños.) Really love the garlic chicken for the Surf’n’turf bowl- it’s conveniently bite-sized, crunchy, flavorful, juicy.  The butter mochi is also legit.< /review><UserId.>102372390527869650264< /UserId.><name>K K<//name><Rate>5< /Rate><Gmap_id>0x808fcd7b622c3c4d:0xa702f01cb9ac0857< /Gmap_id>< Pictures>

They offer a variety of poke options without straying too far from the standard poke. The fish is always good quality with limited silver skin. They have a couple bowl choices to choose from and do offer a surf and turf combo that can include the garlic chicken. The staff and owner are friendly and take pride in the food they are serving. There is limited seating inside but you can easily take your food to go if needed. If you are craving poke and in Japantown Aloha Fresh is a great option.</text>< Pics>

<Date>1541049823257<//Date><Review>New poke place in Japantown. A proper one that marinates the fish instead of mixing it in a bowl in front of you like some other fast casual poke concepts. This is Hawaiian style poke.

I had the Spicy Ahi Shoyu and Spicy Salmon. Tasty but pretty mild on the heat scale. I'm not looking to burn my taste buds but I expect a little more zing when I order something spicy. I also missed that they didn't have furikake for the rice.

Kailua pork is also on the menu. I might try that next time.< /Review>< Response>

<review>Love it! The employee was very helpful and gave out samples (3, even though the sign said 2 max, so extra love for that). I loved the kukui nut ahi tuna (sesame flavor) and the soy spicy ahi tuna. Both complimented each other very well. My pic is of the Poké Lover (2 protein + 2 sides) with half and half rice and salad. Very delicious! Would come again.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8YjYbU1e_3GBC5RR6fJCUawie8NWaqhGxVian=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

Love Aloha Fresh! And so glad they extended their hours. The best thing about them is that they create their own poke mixes that work well together like Kukui Nut Salmon, not the build your own from scratch model that's more common around SJ. They also have surf and turf bowls – love the garlic chicken!</text>

This place is unique. The have different flavors like teriyaki, kukui nut, or massago wasabi. That's why I like this place so much, it's a different kind of poke. Everything is fresh and tastes great!!!< /review>

This is real Hawaiian poke, which is a big step up from any other poke place that I've been to. The fish is flown in fresh a few times a week from Hawaii, and the poke is pre-marinated with intense flavors. My new favorite poke!</Text>

The fish is fresh, many options. Love the sides they have - usually get the pickled cucumber and seaweed salad. Husband loves the Kimchi. Black rice is a must! And the prices are more competitive than other places I've been to (that aren't nearly as good).< /review><userid>102811718852018022734</userid><Pics>None< /Pics><Rating>5</Rating><response>None</response><Time>1572976475712< /Time>< user_name>

<text>Authentic and always fresh Hawaiian poke. The ahi is caught off the coast of the Hawaiian Islands and flown in. While all the pokes are delicious, I particularly love the salty, umami flavor of the Kukui Nut Ahi & Kukui Nut Salmon. This place is the closest I have found on the Mainland to the poke places I loved when I lived back on Oahu and Maui.< /text><time>1576625050397<//time>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>We usually go to Santo market for our tuna because of the great price per pound and amazing flavor. If you’re looking for salmon, this is our spot. They’ve got a bunch of options to choose from. We buy by the pound and usually get spicy and kukui nut. Kukui nut and most of the other flavors could use a bit more flavor.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Aloha Fresh (along with Santo Market down the street) has hands down the best poke in the Bay. Unlike all of the Chipotle-style fast casual poke places that have popped up in the last few years, Aloha Fresh actually marinates their fish and uses traditional Hawaiian flavors/ingredients and it makes a huge difference. Spicy shoyu ahi and miso salmon are my go-tos here, but you can't really go wrong with any of the flavors.</Text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Hawaiian-style poke found here! I opted for 2 pokes, the shoyu ahi and spicy salmon, plus the macaroni salad and crab salad for my sides over white rice. Enjoying my bowl brought me back to the memories of the poke in Hawaii!

The shoyu ahi was really good and spicy salmon has always been a long-time favorite of mine. I really liked that they offered mac salad, I surely ate that first.

I have to return to try the Musubis they had!< /review>< pics>

<text>My son told me about this location they had good Poke. Went there after a Day of golf. Surprisingly a small location limited seating but the ahi or poke I had was a mixed Bowl had a little bit of Ahi or poke and had a nice heat to it it also come with your choice of black rice or white rice. Black rice was exceptionally good and also came with a little bit of salad.  A little pricey for the quantity.  I would recommend buying it separately because it's   also sold by the pound and you can get a scoop of black or white rice with it.   Guava butter mochi for dessert broke da mouth< /text>< Pictures>

<review>Tough contender for best Poké in the Bay. They serve counter-style, which is pre-prepared unlike others that are closer to Chipotle in style. That said, their fish is super fresh and their sauce combinations are DELICIOUS. One tip is that the crab side doesn't cost extra, but I really recommend their cucumbers or seaweed salad in addition to some spicy or kukui nut tuna!<//review>< userid>

<rating>3</rating><Text>Pros: You can get poke with something like inamona on it ("kukui nut" flavor) and they do give you the option of buying poke by weight instead of having to get one of those awful everything-but-the-kitchen-sink things that mainlanders think are great.

Cons: What's the deal with the loud, obnoxious, raggae music? A grand total of no one listens to this stuff in Hawaii. There's a huge, HUGE, body of work by Hawaiian musicians from the early 20th century on, "Slack Key" guitar, just tons of music that's much nicer to listen to, and actually would be much more proper to play in an ostensibly "Hawaiian" place, and might introduce more mainland people to a genre of music they'd enjoy.

Seriously, all the "Hawaiian" places here on the mainland do this, and it's a huge slight to actual Hawaiian music by actual Hawaiian people.< /Text>< Pictures>

Friendly staff and tasty poke! Fish is flown in from Hawaii and has an incredibly fresh flavor. Favorite combo so far is Poke Lovers with Kukui Nut Salmon and Spicy Ahi! If you're wanting something sweet, try the lilikoi butter mochi as well. Teas are also brewed in house.<//Review>

Prices are a little steep, but it's absolutely worth it for the quality meal. Delicious, well dressed wings and incredible fries. The fries alone are so good, they're the sole reason I go there for every lunch break. Wait time is usually 15 mins, and it's always worth the wait.</Text>

5 stars for cleanliness and about to try their food in a couple of minutes, will update after trying their food. Update: Wings are good, lemon pepper a little dry but still good. My order came with no ranch, not sure if that's extra or if I need to ask for it but overall all good.<//review>

Friendly staff, great wings, lovely atmosphere - what more could you ask for? The salt and pepper wings are legitimately some of the best wings I've ever had. That's coming from someone who, prior to eating here, thought no one could top Duff's in Buffalo, NY.<//review>

<text>Went here because my wife wanted to try it she loves chicken wings price was average food was good.Never been to A wing place that charges A dollar for ranch dressing spent 30.00 and the have the balls to ask for A dollar for ranch. Its wings you ALWAYS GET ranch or blue cheese with wings that is like ordering A pizza and they charge extra to put cheese on it. Not cool stop being cheap there is A 128 ounces in A gallon of ranch it costs about 15 dollars if you buy the good brand huge gouging on your customer. wont go back.</text><Date>1598640286902< /Date><Rate>2< /Rate>< response>

<Text>I noticed a new Wing place in town and was excited to give them a try. I ordered 10 wings with Honey BBQ, and spicy Korean. I also got the Nashville chicken sandwich combo with Inferno spice. My combo came with fries and a drink. I was happy to see they serve Pepsi. I enjoyed the flavor choice of my wings. I plan to come back after COVID where I can dine in and order all the flavors. As for the sandwich, the thing was giant. The chicken was so juicy. I wish it was a bit spicier because I love heat, and like a challenge when it comes to spicy food. It was slammed when I was there, but they were cranking out the orders fast. All the food is prepared fresh, so expect a little wait while the chicken cooks. For the chicken fans this place is a must go.<//Text>< Pics>

I tried the nashville chicken sandwich (spicy) it was super delicious, very big and too spicy 🔥🔥🔥
I also tried the bone in wings. Mango habanero, louisiana rub (my favorite)and jamiaca jerk all were awesome.
the fries was super crispy.
The price is fair.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPv3glb-R4h8lL8v3_c5F3dJgb-w58nL348GJHe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

I got this suggestion sent to me to try and I do love chicken !! This place has delicious garlic fries and onion rings .. I prefer their dry rubs , the flavors I tried were lemon pepper / garlic Parmesan/ Louisiana and spicy Korean .. I was not a fan of the garlic Parmesan and I was disappointed because their garlic Parmesan fries are fire 🔥 i went on opening day and the wait was 20-25 mins , not bad .I will definitely be back to try new flavors</review>

The chickensandwich is honestly one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Now the sandwiches have levels of spiciness. I had Spicy and my wife had Medium. My wife found the Medium level too spicy for herself but she also found the sandwich extremely delicious she fought through the spiciness. I on the other hand didnt find a problem with the Spicy level at first but it does kick in. I enjoy spicy food so I didnt have much of an issue although I do think I will go down a level just to enjoy the sandwich a bit more. The french fires are also some of the best fries I've ever had. They are fried to perfection. The Onion rings are also very delicious.<//review>

<name>Randal Flannery</name><Date>1592783212836</Date><Rating>4< /Rating><Text>Wing ferno is a great wing place. Their wing combo is priced well,  and they have some quality chicken. Some of the wings were a little overcooked for my taste though. The spiciest wing flavor wont be that bad for spice-heads, but if you're new to hot wings, it's a good challenge. In my opinion, Wing Ferno isn't the best wing place nearby, but it's leagues better than Buffalo Wild Wings or Wingstop.

The place was clean, and we had our wings right on time.

I had mango habañero and honey Sriracha, and tried the hottest wings with a friend. I would recommend coming a couple times to try the flavors you're interested in.<//Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I absolutely LOVE Tiffany!! I got neck fillers and I was nervous bc it was my first time, but she was super confident, experienced, and a total joy to be around!!. Needless to say I am incredibly happy with the results!! I saw a difference within seconds! Also too, I really appreciate the time she takes to make sure every detail is attended to. Everything from having super cute decor, to having Le Croix available for her clients, to giving us the cutest little makeup gift bags filled with goodies, her attention to detail is so incredibly thoughtful. Her and her staff are really fun to be around as well, and make it a comfortable experience. Also too, Tiffany is so motivated and intelligent, I love that she is advancing to get her Nurse Practitioners License, and is always looking for how she can better herself and her business. I cannot get enough of her! I can’t wait to come back! 💗<//text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>I've been wanting to book an appointment with Tiffany to get my lips done, and I'm SO GLAD I finally did. Tiffany is an artist, and instead of creating cookie-cutter lips, she takes the time to listen to your requests and shapes your lips to complement your face and features. I wanted VERY natural looking lips, for my top lip to look more even and a small pout on my bottom lip. They came out better than I could have imagined, and I am so happy with them. We only used half a syringe, and the best part is that she saves the rest for your next treatment. I've been to doctors that throw out the syringe and make you purchase a new one each time, so it's incredible that Tiffany and her office does this. You are paying for the syringe, after all. I can't wait to come back in a few months and get a touch up from the best artist!! The office is also GORGEOUS and the staff is so nice and welcoming. So happy I found her!< /text>< Pics>

<review>Tiffany is truly an ARTIST!  The receptionist was NOTHING SHORT of sweet to me. She walked me through all the difference procedures, and asked me what areas I was interested in, and really took the time to listen to me and make me feel comfortable. She also texted me and I'm sure I must have annoyed her with a thousand questions, but not once did she seem bothered.  Tiffany also welcomed me as if I had been a long time client, and really listened to me and answered all my questions in order to get results that I really wanted. Ive been to a few other medical spas, but nothing tops Tiffany's customer service and listening skills. And the cherry on top? I LOVED THE RESULTS! I will never go to another spot for my fillers. Tiffany is my new go to, and her work really speaks for itself.<//review></record>

Tiffany is wonderful. She is so kind and caring, and takes her time to understand each client’s needs and desires. I have been seeing her for a few years and will always remain loyal. My results have always been super natural, and I trust Tiffany with all things to do with my face. She has been doing my Botox for years, and has done some filler for me. I love all of it!  Her office staff is incredibly kind—you’ll be in great hands!<//review>

Tiffany is the sweetest, most experienced injector out there! Her staff is amazing, thorough and currently taking multiple steps to ensure patients are welcomed and safe during these times. I did my fair share of research on the best place to get fillers and other skin services in LA. After much digging, I was entirely confident Beverly Hills Beauty & Aesthetics would leave me looking gorgeous! And they did. Tiffany’s hands are the gentlest and her products and skills are undoubtably the best! You won’t be disappointed! Xo< /Text>

I've been seeing Tiffany Holiday for Botox for the last eight years. She never bruises me (many others did), I always get the perfect result, and she has the utmost professionally run office. I cant say the same for anyone I went to before. She's the best in town. Look no further. Five Stars highly recommend!!!</text>

Tiffany is amazing! I visited her location in Agoura Hills and I was blown away by her beautiful facility. From the moment I walked in I felt at ease with the front desk being so warm and welcoming. Tiffany is so friendly and down to earth and really listened to all of my needs and concerns and I felt immediately that I could trust her opinions and advice. She made my entire experience so seamless and I will definitely be going back for all of my beauty needs!!</Text>

She explained everything and went over the different fillers. When I inquired about getting filler in other areas besides my lips, she could tell I wasn't 100% on doing so after she explained everything. I appreciate that she wasn't pushy and told me to do some more research to make myself feel better before getting it done. You won't be disappointed, she's so good at what she does!</Text>< pictures>

<Review>I went to visit Tiffany after I had a dental procedure that caused me to lose all of my teeth.Permanent dentures were a resolve to my dental issues, but changed my facial structure. I had super full, plump lips before my surgery and after had lost my natural fullness in both the upper and bottom portion of my mouth. I explained my situation to Tiffany,I showed her pictures of my mouth before my surgery and she gave me a filler treatment using Juvederm.The procedure legitimately changed my life by giving back what I had so unfortunately lost.I had my confidence back, my lips had fullness again, they were plump and my smile had so much life.I have gone back since for another procedure to maintain my fullness and I was satisfied yet again thanks to Tiffany RN1</Review>< resp>

Tiffany is my rockstar. I have been going to her for over 3 years now and she has changed my lips for good. I have had a deep bite issue since childhood, braces couldn’t fix it. But she did .. who knew lips could make such a difference. Post pregnancy, her technique and the fillers made such a difference in my under eye areas as well. I am amazed to say the least. Will keep going to her for as long as I can. Xoxo</Review>

<review>I went to see Tiffany for the first time at her beautiful glam location in Agoura Hills.  I explained that I was looking for a subtle, natural look.  She really listened to my concerns and was very honest about my options, pricing and results.  I wound up getting under eye filler, lip filler and Botox and could not be happier with the results!  A huge plus is that Tiffany is extremely personable and funny, it truly was a pleasure.< /review>< Rating>

I was so looking forward to seeing Tiffany, i drove an hour just to see her. I was disappointed overall with my experience there. The office is so cute and tiffany is sweet but I feel I may have been a little taken advantage of when it came to payment. Tiffany told me there were different types of fillers but left out the price differences between each one- when i called and made my appointment the receptionist said a syringe can be as low as $675- so that was the price point i had in mind. Tiffany suggested a filler and i trusted her judgement but the one she chose was $800 which is way more than i planned on spending.
I just would think that this would be something she would to mention to a mid 20 year old seeing that $800 is a lot of money for 1 syringe. Additionally at checkout there is a tip option, and I felt obligated to tip. So all in all i ended up spending $900, which i just find astonishing. For how much i spent i wish my lips were more full. Tiffany is sweet and her office space is lovely but i just can’t help but feel like i was a little misled.<//Text>

{'time': 1608151762787, 'text': "Hello Elizabeth,  I do want to address that we are always very clear on pricing. The prices have not changed in years. It has always been $675-$850. With the lesser expensive one going away faster and being more natural and less robust. People choose their fillers for various reasons and I give all options to see which one sounds the best for each patient. I recall discussing that $675 filler, Juvederm ultra, and you told me to decide, and that you wanted really full lips. I chose the filler of preference that would guarantee more fullness than ultra and less bruising bc you were traveling soon for the holidays. I think its unfair if you don't tell me your budget, then get upset at the pricing? Also you have naturally full lips and I remember telling you natural big lips require more filler to get super full results. I guarantee wherever you get the next syringe, that will be the amount you need to be happy. We absolutely want all of our patients to have the safest and best experience possible.  Understanding we are a boutique practice and not for everyone,  a followup visit would have probably gotten you further than this review,  but that's neither here nor there. The tipping option is meant for our aesthetician services as is customary for spa treatments.  We certainly never expect anything. Sorry we were not a good fit. Wish you the best on your beauty journey."}</Resp>

<review>I have seen Tiffany for years! I remember my first time getting lip filler, I was so scared because I wanted a VERY natural result and something that wouldn’t change my whole face (or something that wouldn’t make people knew I had got filler).

After my first visit, I was so shocked to see the beautiful, natural results with very minimal bruising. Even my husband didn’t know I had something done lol needless to say, I was back in two weeks because after the swelling went down, I wanted more! Tiffany always knows best when it comes to enhancing one’s beauty. She will give you her honest opinion on what filler will fit your needs. I drive more than an hour to see Tiffany and I am always blown away at the results.

Seeing her is like catching up with an old friend, she is amazing.<//review>< GmapID>

I've been going to Tiffany for 8 years and she is so knowledgeable about beauty, what works and her placement has always been perfect & givin me my desired results. I've gone to other people in the past but no one was as confident, friendly and as Knowledgeable as Tiffany which are all attributes you want from someone touching your face with needles. Her Wilshire location is closer to me, but I'm willing to drive to her Agoura Hills location too, because I trust her work!!< /Review>

Tiffany is the best! I totally trust her with my face. I was so nervous about getting Botox and fillers but as soon as we met I felt like she totally understood me. She knew exactly what to do to achieve the results I wanted. I booked two appointments with her in one month and now I went from old face to youthful smooth face and full pouty lips. I get so many compliments on how good I look. Can’t wait to go back for more treatments!<//review>

<Review>I love coming in to see Tiffany! She is always so sweet and every time after I get my Botox there is never any bruising and the pain is less then getting an eyebrow wax. I have recommended her to others and will do so in the future. 🥰<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Tiffany is absolutely amazing! She always listens to my beauty goals and delivers my dream results every time I see her.
I’ve been to both of her offices (Beverly Hills and Agoura Hills) and they are so pretty and glam. I love Tiffany and her team, can’t wait for my next beauty touch up!</Text>

Tiffany knows exactly what she is doing and is amazing! Not only is she so kind and nice but her staff are just as great! It was my first time ever getting filler and they made me feel so comfortable and answered all my questions. Never pushed me to get more and she knew the exact look I wanted and I got that with my lips!! I will be back for more and I trust her for my Botox. Can’t wait to see my look once I get my Botox and more filler 😁😁< /review>

My personal experience with Tiffany and Beverly Hills beauty was horrible and i was completely scammed. I went for a consultation for the service called sculptra which are injections that i wanted in my hips to give myself a fuller look. I’m very picky so i asked a million questions and even showed pictures of what i wanted (that I’ll show below). She recommended that i do two sessions in one which would come out to 4,800 to achieve my goal. She was very sweet and reassuring that i was the perfect candidate because my hip dips were so small and I’m naturally small so i didn’t need much. After i showed her a picture of what i was trying to achieve not once did she say i would need more than the 2 sessions, if she would have i wouldn’t have got the procedure. She did say people come and get the procedure, see good results and get addicted and keep coming back for more. My appointment was July 29th 2020 a week after my consultation so you can imagine how ready and excited i was to get the procedure. I got the procedure, she claimed i had no signs of bruising which i was sure i would have some bruising cause i kinda bruise easily. The first night i was little bruised the second day i was really bruised and third day and days after that my hips were completely black and purple. I sent her a picture and asked if it was normal. She didn’t give me yes or no.. she just gave me advice on what to do. There was one night i put a heating pad on it one time and i asked her the next morning if it was ok.. she told me nice work and continued to recommend doing other options that include more heat. I didn’t use the heating pad after that. Another question i asked was if i could work out after getting the procedure she said you can work out the next day. I also recommended a friend and when she met with my friend she told her she had never seen someone bruise how i bruised and that she felt so bad she lost sleep over it. So clearly something was wrong. Fast forward 3 months after paying 4,800 i have zero results and i am still somewhat  bruised on both sides of my body which i believe is now a scar. I messaged Tiffany expressing my concerns about the bruising i still have and Having no results and appreciating some type of refund. I went to see Tiffany for a post appointment. She took new photos of me to compare my before and after and to her she claims the results are “undeniable”. Because I’ve been working out and eating very well during quarantine I’ve definitely gained about 10 pounds of muscle as can see in the before and after pictures below, the difference in my legs and butt in the pictures but no changes in my hips. When i met with her she also offered me a chemical peel in exchange for the inconvenience. I spent 4,800 dollars had zero results and have a scar on both sides of my hips and she offered me a 200 dollar chemical peel. Didn’t say anything about any type of refund. She also claimed there could of been something wrong with the sculptra and reached out to the people that provides her the sculptra and told them my experience because she’s been doing this for “10 years and never has seen something like my bruising before” so again she knows something was wrong. After she told me working out was okay and the heat was okay she started making excuses for the bruising and lack of results saying working out and the heating pad one time and taking warm baths could of affected it. I went home she sent me my before and afters side by side. It wasn’t sitting well with me that i paid all this money and had such a horrible experience so i told Tiffany i wasn’t happy and if she wasn’t willing to give me a partial refund then i would have to leave a bad review telling my experience and show the pictures of my bruising, she claimed i was trying to blackmail and extort her instead of being sympathetic to my lack of results and bruising. I would never black mail or extort anyone, i didn’t want to leave a negative review
Or affect her business in a negative way and was giving here a chance to come to an agreement with me.She did not help me< /Text>

Found Beverly Hills Beauty through a co worker. We had talked about Botox and lip fillers but, being a newbie, I didn’t know where to go.  I went in for my first appointment and was terrified. I was nervous about doing too much or the possibility of looking “fake”. Tiffany was my aesthetic nurse and she made me feel comfortable right away. Being new to all of this, I didn’t really know what look I was going for. Tiffany gave her input and I went ahead with her recommendations. Truth be told, I’ve never felt more confident in my life. She gave me just enough glam without overdoing it. She is straight forward and honest which I also appreciated. She was there during the healing process to answer any and all questions I had and also responded quickly . I loved my lips so much that I went back 3 weeks later for another half syringe haha. During that appointment I even booked an appointment for a PDO thread lift ! That appointment was pretty nerve wracking and I wasn’t with Tiffany for that procedure, so once again I was scared. I met aesthetic nurse Lana and once again I was thrilled to have someone who made me feel comfortable! She gave me my minor eyebrow lift/snatch and even helped me decided on how dramatic of a look I wanted. She was also honest and straightforward with me and was fun to conversation with. I am beyond thankful to have found this establishment. No matter who you have as your nurse, you will have a wonderful experience and come out looking even more beautiful than you already are. I will never go anywhere else. Take all my money lol. Thank you ladies ! Can’t wait to come back ❤️❤️< /Review>

Rushed my last lip appointment because they were running a full hour late. I didn’t pay 700+ to be rushed in and out in 20 minutes. Pretty sure she didn’t use the entire amount of product but didn’t tell me. Don’t believe the hype with this one! Not a good experience<//Review>

<Review>I've been Tiffany's client since 2007 and she is probably the best in this city when it comes to injections. I never bruise, her techniques give you instant lifts, she's very professional and her prices are great. If you care about looking younger and preventative aging, call her for an appointment. She's the best!< /Review><Date>1495311263944</Date><pictures>None< /pictures>< Name>

<Review>Today was a great experience. There is a new guy there. He transferred from the valley I'm not good with names and at this point I wish I was better because this guy gave excellent customer service
Really helpful advising me if what I purchased didn't work bring it back for an exchange and where I could get product if needed. Unlike previous service when I would be promised product in a month and would be contacted at that time if things changed. I would not get the call and nobody would be able to inform me on where the product was after it was already paid for. I give this company 3 stars because the majority of service at the Torrance location is terrible excluding today when I was assisted by the new guy.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

But it's expensive, so just buy what you need.

하지만 값이 많이 비싸니 꼭 필요한 물건만 구입하세요.<//text>

Super nice people, not so nice food. I got super scrambled egg with hash browns. I could only eat the hash browns. Scrambled eggs were kind of dry and tasteless.<//Text>

Friendly people and basic menu. Don’t expect fine dining and extra frills, but it’s a solid local diner.  We had good service and I wish I could give it 4.5 but the rating system is limited.</Review>

"The Bird" sandwich was a bad joke of a sandwich compared to the former owner's sandwich. Such a shame to run the menu into the ground like that!
Good luck!

Again, no waiting to be seated. I had the Corned Beef Hash, (about like the former half order) and it's not as moist and tasty as the previous owner's Corned Beef...

4/15/18
New owners, similar menu, similar open and close times.
Some new items on the menu; Eggs Benedict-Ham really (Black Forest sandwich meat) or Bacon (should be called Canadian Bacon on the menu). Does not include fruit so, if you don't want the potatoes, kind of skimpy portion...
Huevos Rancheros with chorizo; different than before, no tortillas with cheese! Instead, scrambled eggs with chorizo, 3 wimpy tortillas, cold and runny black beans. Food seems to sit on the pick up counter awhile and aren't always delivered at the same time to the table as before... Growing pains?
No waiting Saturday morning at 10, good for us but, not a good sign for the restaurant?< /text><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

What was once a very popular neighborhood spot for breakfast and lunch has declined to the point that we will not return.  A reduced menu, the distraction of waiters chattering noisily in Chinese behind the counter, bits of paper and debris on the floor, loss of the pleasant vibe from long-term repeat customers:  it simply is not the same.  Chow in Lafayette, always a good choice, now simply the best.  Sad.  And I'm sure that the great bookstore next door is suffering as a result too, another loss.< /Text><UserId.>106881890614751554897</UserId.></record>

We went for breakfast on a Wednesday afternoon. The service was good and the Food was so yummy!!!  We had  corn beef  hash ,  2 Sunnyside up eggs and a  Light crispy waffle with real Maple syrup. The corn beef was made in house.  Corn beef   Hash add chunks of  Tender moist corn beef and the potato was crispy. Really a perfect breakfast. That's service was friendly. We had a enjoyable experience. And they serve breakfast all day.  BAM, .</review>

The food wasn't bad, but $20 for breakfast?  The waitress kept trying to upsell things like peppers and onions with the potatoes or fresh-squeezed juice.  Coffee was bitter french roast from a drip machine priced at $2.75 per diner cup.  The service was good but in my opinion this place is way too expensive for a cafe.</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80857cd93e8a01cd:0xd0d9288ee3773ece<//gmapID></record>

This long-time Orinda restaurant has new owners( within the last year). The food is consistently good and service is quick. It's down home cooking with lots of healthy choices in addition to their grilled cheese, Reuben sandwiches, amazing french fries. Their tuna fish salad is awesome and a great addition to a green salad for healthy, satisfying meal. Breakfast items are served until 11:30 a.m. check them out!<//text>

Even with a recent ownership change, its still a great place for breakfast. The waffles are outstanding. Corned beef hash, still good. A little pricey and usually a small wait.<//Text>

breakfast on weekends, weekdays, and anyday in the summer. Unfortunately, the only two remained is this one  and Millie's Kitchen in Lafayette.
After changing hands a few times. I' m surprised that the menu remains the same, the famous corn beef  hash and waffle taste just like 20 years ago. The new staff is equally upbeat and friendly. Thank goodness for family diners that stay around and keep serving  no nonsense American food among all the diet fads.  I still visit weekly.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80857cd93e8a01cd:0xd0d9288ee3773ece<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Sunday all-day breakfast is great at this place. First time we went we had significant wait at the table, but the next two times were pretty quick. Generous portions so beware and don't order too much! e.g. cinnamon toast in the picture.</review>

This is the best breakfast place in Orinda. The egg breakfast is fabulous, I typically split the bacon and sausage and love the home style potatoes. Orders take a bit to come out of the kitchen but it definitely worth the wait< /Review>

They have the freshest ingredients. Clean bathroom. The tastiest food. Never frozen. The staff always remember what I want when I go there. I get the same thing every time. 3 egg omelette with country taters and sour dough toast. It's my favorite but everything else I have tried is good too.</Text>

First time ever visiting California. I stop to get the oil and tires changed at Orinda Motors and I decide I am hungry. So, I walk over to this little cafe. Very nice customer service, food is very tasty, and the OJ is out of this world. That is saying a lot because I live in Florida 😁. Next time I'm in the area, I would come back just for the orange juice.</review>

My favorite place to get Cafe food in town, it's tucked away in a shopping center. Classic diner type food, but you can get a good healthy salad or home made soup too.  Kids love the milkshakes.  Owners Snarky and Cathy are great, loyal staff is friendly.<//Review>

Five stars is high praise but I have never had a bad meal there and I have had plenty of good/great ones. The ingrediants always taste fresh and wonderful.The service is always good. I used to live in Orinda so I went quite often. Now I live in San Francisco and look forward to an excuse to go out there and have a meal.I make it about once a month now.<//text>

Cozy family owned diner in Orinda. The Belgian waffles and country cried potatoes are great. The owner and staff are friendly and seem to remember what their regular customers like to order.<//review>

Ended up going here because in the Lamorinda area you have maybe two options for breakfast around 6am. I decided to give them a shot, and I will not be going back. The food was not appetizing at all. My friend took one bite of his scrambled eggs and ham and put his fork down, and that dude eats just about anything. It was like cafeteria food. I can see how since it's the only game in town that people could get defensive about it, but even Crepevine is leagues better than this place, and Crepevine is just average.

Avoid it, spend the extra 10 minutes and go somewhere in Oakland or Berkeley.<//text>

(Translated by Google) A very popular place. Works something 'oldschool'. If you want to enjoy the delicious food and the nice service, you should be prepared for the weekend to plan a little time to wait ... but it was definitely worth it for us.

Ein sehr beliebter Ort. Wirkt etwas 'oldschool'. Wer das leckere Essen und den netten Service genießen möchte, sollte gerade am Wochenende darauf gefasst sein ein bisschen Wartezeit einzuplanen... hat sich aber bei uns auf jeden Fall gelohnt.<//text>

I'm conflicted because the people who work here were actually pretty nice and friendly. That being said they didn't use new or clean tools and products in-between clients and didn't clean them either. I definitely won't be going back simply for their sanitation protocols, or should I say lack thereof. You'd think with covid they'd be extra cautious.<//text>

<text>They are very very very very (I don't have enough time to put the amount of very's they deserve) slow. They'll have 3 or 4 people doing absolutely nothing but still won't see other patrons. The only "lovely" thing about this nail salon is leaving and taking your business elsewhere</text><gmapID>0x80dcabac57827eaf:0xfbadc18b94cfe03c<//gmapID>< time>

<review>The people were friendly enough but the lady did my toes like 3 times and they still look awful. Gave me $5 off . I feel like I shouldn't have paid at all really. I could have done what she did at home and I could have done it better. The nails are OK. I do like that they were flat and not thick with acrylic. I won't go there again unfortunately</review><user_id>104112599975865242446< /user_id><username>Jessica Garcia< /username><gmap_id>0x80dcabac57827eaf:0xfbadc18b94cfe03c<//gmap_id><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNC06BbC_mFt39F7b5xwCADgrk88S3Ret5CMJs-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvJqXsOowkmhMu1obkRTyh0rWLUVHeF17yDOUs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMdtTK-tY46P3C6DenfG_UejXWkK1iFqM04891=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGCN4f2uzecYcEA8kr-jcqH9MQFL-XmQ1E9BJO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Rate>

The lady attempted three times and couldn’t get it done if they’re going to have designs they should know how to do them because my nails were not painted all the way on the sides and by my cuticles done right  it already looks like I need another  fill the nail that I paid extra for was done wrong the polish was extremely thick when I wanted to get it re-done was told the same lady would be doing my nails why would I want the same lady who doesn’t know how to do her job do my nails it made no sense I will not be going back here</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Cindy does the greatest job! She’s so nice and takes the time to ask for more details of what nails you want. She gets them on point every time I love it! It’s exactly what you expect plus more and she also takes the time to check her work! She a great worker and works fast!!!  5 stars for her alone but as a company 4 stars. Cindy and the main lady are great the main lady so nice remembers faces and names also very welcoming seems like a great owner and boss but for the others No words. I was disappointed with my pedicure I didn’t get her name . I hate driving to 2 different nail shops. If they can get better with their pedicures that would be great.</review><rating>4</rating><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<text>Make an appointment before you go... they do well to honor appointments. There is one younger lady who is super fast and efficient, strong hands and I want to fall asleep because it feels very relaxing. They use plastic liners and clean their instruments. You can also bring your own too. Their regular polish color selection is a bit limited but you'll find something you like and the price is the best part... it's not a trendy yuppie place at all but it's worth the small nail salon experience. Plus... the ladies are Vietnamese so the chatter is entertaining even though I have no idea what they're saying haha!< /text><Name>Sarah Kim< /Name><user>102612559682273061250<//user>< time>

First visit and was a walk-in.  Best manicure I think I have ever had with Cindy and one of the  best pedicures with another technician. Very impressed.  I plan on returning.<//Review>

<Text>This place is amazing. They are busy so make an appointment.  I see Denise and she does all kinds of designs.  She freehand paints all her designs.  It a clean place with friendly people.  I almost went to a place closer to home but decided not to.  It's worth the 20 min drive!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I have visited lots of nail and spa places around this area but I found they are the best. I am going there regularly now. Give them a chance. We are human being so we all do mistakes. But they have a positive attitude always. And they do care for their customers. I really love them.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

< review>
Does this place have great service? Yes, it does. They have great prices and do great work along with being clean and somewhat neat. The reason why I give this place 3 stars is because the last time I went there was to remove my nails and have new ones put on, I stopped the process after they got done removing my nails. The lady I was working with REMOVED MY NAILS WRONG! She stuck a cuticle cutter in between my real nail and fake nail and starting pulling my nail up starting from the cuticle to the end of the nail, the process was painful and she cut me several times doing it, she damaged my natural nails leaving them with scratch marks and lumpy all the way up to the cuticle. I won't be returning here because I feel that its shameful for a nail salon to not know how to properly remove nails and only know the way that could leave your nails permanently damaged. If you are thinking about getting your nails removed DO NOT GO HERE!</review>

<Text>This place is horrible. As soon as the girl started, she cut me bad!!! She was answering the phone the entire time booking appointments while doing my nails. It took her 2 hours to do my acrylics & she half-a**ed them. The customer service is just terrible. I should’ve walked out because it was not worth it. Try “In-Style Nail Spa” in highland ca instead. I went there for them to fix them and they look amazing now. AVOID THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<rating>1</rating><Review>I got my nails done with gel polish on Sunday February 3, 2019 and in 2 days my nails were already chipping. I don’t ever do anything that Involves me having to use my hands for hard work. Then when I went back today(February 7th 2019) the lady continually messed up and would put the gel on my nail then would realize she messed up and file it all down agin and start over. For 3 nails it took an hour for her to fix my nails. I overall didn’t not like my experience and will not EVER be returning.<//Review>< Pictures>

My mother and I got horrible service here. It's like they take an extremely long time on purpose when customers come so they can tell them to come back later so they'll leave. I have gone to many places and none have been this bad. I now even have a messed up toe and so does my mom from this place. Not worth it here. Then they charge you 3 dollars more for getting your toes done on the spa chair instead of a regular chair.<//text>

< review>
Hot fried Nashville chicken. Need I say more?
Generous chicken tenders or sliders, with french fries, Mac and cheese, and/or kale salad; and drinks, soda or juice.
My only issue is that the strip mall has limited parking.
The tenders are largish, and come wrapped in a slice of bread. Choice of heat goes from balmy to nuclear, which I was too chicken to try.
Sliders (tenders) come in a bun with Mac and cheese. Inside the bun.</review>

<review>Very bland food compared to so many other excellent restaurants nearby. I'm sure the crowd who likes an Americanized gravy based no surprises Mexican fare may like it, our hosts did. However, I would not return.< /review><rating>2</rating>< gmap_id>

<Text>Food was okay but extremely expensive. Small portions. I'm from Chicago and wish I could find a good, authentic, greasy, hole-in-the-wall Mexican food establishment.  That's where the best food is at. It's ironic that you can virtually walk to Mexico from the here and there's zero good Mexican food restaurants. Yet travel 2000 miles and the food is awesome!</Text><Rate>3<//Rate><Pics>None</Pics>< Date>

<text>Definitely a top quality Mexican restaurant food is excellent. I did notice one comment about price for amount of food you get. Yes I would agree to a point. But with cost of food and labor it is the same in every restaurant now a days.This is not stopping us from going here. When you find a good restaurant you stick to it. I definitely find is going back for great food!!<//text>< Pics>

<review>Prices are too high for quality of food. At my recent experience the male host seemed upbeat and the only attentative one. The rest of service was minimal and unfriendly. For the same $$$ check out Fresh Agave up the street for a much better experience all around.</review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dafdbca0fa99e7:0xad2b556994b4cf25<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>Dinner with 3 other ladies and waited 45 minutes for food.  Meanwhile, we had a few extra tiny dishes of salsa to go with the chips.  When the bill came, we were charged for the extra salsa....$3.00.  They Should have eaten the cost since we waited so long for food.  Salsa at every other mex restaurant has been free and constantly flowing.....not this place.
If you eat here, easy on the salsa!<//text><user>106346838031112241038</user>< Response>

We thought the food was fabulous!  Just the way we like it.  We had a couple of special requests and the servers were polite, accommodating, and brought us exactly what we asked for.  It's a homey type restaurant but the staff is totally professional, friendly and eager to please!</review>

<Rating>3</Rating><text>We have eaten here a few times and it is usually excellent. The last visit however was disappointing. Our waiter took forever to come over after we were seated and food took almost an hour. When we got it they were out of several things (including rice??) but were not offered substitutions or any compensation. Some of the food was cold and two orders were wrong. Our waters were never refilled and the waiter largely ignored us. It was very busy that night, but in Palm Springs in peak season that should be expected.</text>< userid>

More than a business is a place to be called home just because they have authentic flavors and recipes.
And the wey they take care of customers is just indescribable.
Thank you Los Pepes.
I personally think better than other typical Mexican restaurant.< /Text>

< Review>
To start off, a Mexican restaurant with no "aguas frescas" is not a Mexican restaurant..i asked for an horchata and even the waitress said it was embarrassing that they don't have any Mexican drinks,  I ordered their caldo de albóndigas  and they had no Mexican flavor and were more like American meatballs that you find in spaghetti.... the soup came with a side of rice and it was the size of a plate of rice that I would give to my 2 year old niece.   The waitress attending us was great but the food wasn't unfortunately.   I forgot what my parents ordered but they too weren't satisfied with it.   The portions are small and over priced.   I've been eating authentic Mexican food all my life and there really isn't much authenticity in this restaurant.   To begin with they really should introduce aguas fresca to their menu.<//Review>

The people are super nice and the place is family run. The signs need a little bit of an update but most of all the food might be a little expensive side but it is absolutely worth every penny. Maybe even plus some. You have to try the fries< /Review>

<Text>I've only been here twice, first time was outstanding,my club sandwich was excellent,service shined.....went back the following day at the same time for lunch, service still good but there was a guy walking around the inside of the whole place carting one of those big silver cans of bug spray attached to a spray wand actually spraying bug spray along the floor even saw him come from the kitchen spraying, he even said excuse me as I took a step back to get out of his way while he walked along spraying. No I could not bring myself to eat it nor will go back again.And that's too bad because the people that worked there seemed very nice.</Text>< pictures>

Been going here for drinks, food, and snacks for years! I love there boba drinks, their bowls are amazing, I love getting candy here they have some that you don’t see everyday and it’s well worth the stop, plus kinda hard to miss with a giant chicken out front 😂👌🏻</Text>

<Review>Have always ordered a chicken bowl. Which is always very good! This time I thought I would try a Cheese Burger. Big Mistake.... Took a few bites. Their was a piece of bone in the meat. This cost me tooth pain, days later had to have a root canal done. Don't think I will be eating there for awhile...🍔<//Review><date>1601706252665</date>< resp>

It was my favorite place to go to after school to get a burger with my ex partner but recently the burgers have kind of dropped in their quality. Though it's a restaurant it also has a little market where you can buy drinks and snacks which is cool I guess<//text>

The pancakes were tasty. I tried the chorizo breakfast with refried beans and rice that was tasty. The only thing I didn't like is that they didn't have cream or milk for the coffee. They have powdered cream, nobody will call a dinner worth its salt, a dinner unless it has real cream for the coffee. Goodnight Irene!</Review>

This place customer service is bad, the women casher doesnt seem friendly. Cant even tell if this was a dining place it look more like a convient store. Food charge alot for steak and egg plate when the steak is so small, charge the price more expensive then it should be. Food doesnt taste that great.< /text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><review>I always receive outstanding service, both from the dental hygienists and the front desk assistants. Everything is always explained in detail and my well-being during my visit is always considered. If I ask for a price in advance of a future procedure, they always oblige me. Dr. Lapidus is always professional and takes time to explain my x-rays. He's very proactive, giving options for how/when to address any potential work that needs to be done. I have been with Dr. Lapidus over five years and highly recommend him as a dentist that you can rely on. His commitment to his patients is stellar!< /review><gmap_id>0x80ecf11511437747:0x8c0623d60e6e0f57<//gmap_id>< username>

< Review>
I’m so happy I’ve found Dr Lapidus. He’s great, and also has a fantastic hygienist. Heather gives the most thorough and comprehensive cleanings I’ve ever had. But she’s also extremely careful and gentle, so it isn’t painful. I also appreciate how willing she is to share her extensive knowledge about how to make your teeth healthier. It’s not the normal lecture about flossing. Instead, it’s practical advice that you can actually use. They’re the things that no one else has taken the time to tell you about, but make a difference. Everything she does makes you feel like she cares about her patients.< /Review>

<name>Natasha Lemak</name><Review>My spouse and I have really enjoyed our care in Dr. Lapidus office!  He gives so much information including details I’ve never heard before from previous dentists (general dental knowledge as well as specific information about how my teeth are aligned).

He also uses some newer technology like the scanner for my night guard - previously I’ve had to endure the uncomfortable goop in my mouth but this last time they just used a handheld camera scanner that was so much easier!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><time>1621789426895</time><user_id>116470287128851401737< /user_id><rate>5<//rate><gmap_id>0x80ecf11511437747:0x8c0623d60e6e0f57<//gmap_id></record>

<review>Dr Lapidus has an extremely calming and soothing bedside manner. Some may interpret it as nonchalance but that's not it. He's committed to providing the best solutions and presenting any choices with data and years of experience. He just does it with a calming presence. Highly recommend!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Review>Going to the dentist has never been my favorite thing to do, but the whole staff at Dr. Lapidus' office is so welcoming and friendly, it really takes the edge off. The hygienist who cleans my teeth is thorough but gentle and the doctor always takes time to at least say hello even when he's not doing an exam. I recommend this office to one and all!<//Review>< date>

Dr. Lapidus is a fellow veteran who has provided me and my wife with top-notch dental care since we moved to San Luis in 2018.  I'm impressed with how he and his brilliant staff have responded to challenges posed by C-19, and felt extremely safe during my cleaning, x-rays, and check-up today.  If you're looking for excellent dental care, I recommend Dan without reservation.< /review>

<text>Your office staff are wonderful, they make you feel like you're the only one there.  I really liked how Heather told me as she went along what she was doing and was so professional yet warm and caring.  Dr. Lapidus role models these qualities himself: smart, I know I am in good hands, explains choices well, respectful and caring.  Am very impressed and grateful!<//text>< Pics>

<pics>None</pics><Text>10/1/2020  -  The highlight of my dental appointment was the covey of quails that paraded by the window while I was in the dental chair waiting for Dr. Lapidus to start working on my cavities.  Dr. Lapidus and his staff are always concerned about the comfort of their patients.  Happy to say that I am home now and I am not in any pain.

Today (March 10, 2021) my appointment in this office was for a 6 month    cleaning.  I wasn't in the room where the window faces the hillside where I saw the covey of quails tripping along behind the Mama.  Nevertheless, my appointment went well.  I was praised for taking good care of my teeth and gums and was told to "Keep up the good work!".  Dr. Lapidus stuck his head in to see how I was doing which is just one of his friendly gestures.  I'll be back in September for another check-up and cleaning.</Text>< username>

Dr Lapidus and his staff are the best!  He takes the time to make sure I understand all procedures and I'm comfortable with every step.  They take extra precautions for their patients safety and health.  It's wonderful to have their level of competency available on the Central Coast.< /review>

But as always Mr. Lapidus and his staff took care of me and my worries left me. I am blessed to have Mr. Lapidus as my dentist and to have his staff in my life... Thank you Mr. Lapidus and staff for making my life smile and my life better .. Louis Caric</review>< Rate>

<Text>My wife and I have seen several dentists in SLO county over the years but Dr. Lapidus is the best. His staff are kind, professional and very helpful. The hygienists are great and very knowledgeable. Dr. Lapidus himself is just fantastic. You can tell he loves his craft and focuses on what is best for his patients. If you need a dentist give them a chance. You won't regret it.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80ecf11511437747:0x8c0623d60e6e0f57<//gmap_id>< Pics>

<review>Needed a blower motor and wheel for a 75+ year old furnace, manufactured by a company that no longer exists and no one has heard of. Bruff spent about an hour of trial and error, but in the end got me up and running. AAA did what no one else even wanted to touch, and that's why they all referred me to them. Literally A+++ service!! Thank you so much for the heat!!!<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Great supplier. Often, we run into those special motors that no other supplier has, so we come here to get them. Service is always fast, and these guys know their stuff.</Text>

I went in to buy a new capacitor, the lady behind the desk checked my capacitor and found out that it was still good. She gave me some pointers to fix my motor. I will try to fix it myself but if not I will definitely be bringing my motor back to AAA electric motors for repair.</Review>< Pics>

I went into big five sporting goods on Rosecrans to purchase a pair of boots for my husband for Christmas. I was immediately greeted and the cashier qualified upon arrival in a friendly manner

By the time I got to what I was shopping for there was someone waiting to greet me. Bailey was there to help me with my size, color and specific requests offering add-on items such as socks.  Which I bought. Bailey even sold me another pair of shoes. Turns out they were the same shoes I was looking for at another retailer but $10 cheaper.

She offered to bring both boxes of shoes and socks to the register because she saw my hands were full. I was so excited with the service I made mention to the store manager Richard of her assistants and helpfulness.

Thank you big five for making my Christmas shopping easy and such a pleasant experience.< /text>

<user_name>Bill Anderson</user_name><review>Tiny store with no selection.  Came for a backpacking tent.  There were three tents (not types of tents, but three individual tents) in the whole store.  No 1-3 person tents at all.  Camping section was smaller than your average Walmart camping aisle.  When I go to a dedicated camping store, I expect either quality, value, or selection.</review>< userid>

<review>The cashiers are always polite. The shoe department guy was not very attentive,  gave an air of avoidance, a slacker. Limited selection of mens clothing and not enough shoe sizes available. The placement of products gives this place a overly cramped shopping experience.</review>< pics>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>At the moment I'd give it 4 stars. Overall it's a great place for shoes and sale items. During covid19 and after reopening there's big markdowns and clearance items. I got boxing gloves on markdown for 50.00.  It will probably take a while to completely restock for 2020.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>I buy all my running & active shoes there on sale. I have for about 20+ years. My most recent purchase was a mummy bag on sale for my earthquake survival kit. I want to buy a dartboard set on sale for my brother. It's a great place (almost like an outlet) for anything sports or outdoor related. The newspaper ads are fun! Great place.</Review><Name>Karen Ray< /Name>< userid>

<Review>As store start to reopen, I think patience will need to be had. I visited Big 5 and the service was very. Very slow.  In fact, I was there waiting for them to help me, find the item which, by the way was not on the floor. I left without making a purchase.  I walked in knowing what I wanted only to leave without. We have been in a stay at home environment for so long I believe people have forgotten how to work. 2 stars for opening the store and coming to work in the middle of a pandemic.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Excellent customer service from the sales associates on up to the managers. Entire staff worked as a team. Working as a team towards a common goal (outstanding customer service) is CRUCIAL  to the retail brick and mortar stores survival in today's online shopping craze. Man I wish I would have exhibited this type of business acumen at Humboldt State. I was too busy trying to keep Debbie for myself and shooing away the ones vying for her attention. LOL..They didn't stand a chance. None of them were drummers. She loves the drums and drummers with talent and skill.j and j of in?< /Text>< Rate>

This is the closest sporting goods store to fisherman's wharf. They are open late for anyone needing tackle or gear before leaving out on an offshore trip. They had everything I needed. The prices are more affordable than the tackle shops at the wharf. My 3 star rating reflects my feelings about the cost of merchandise, the selection, and the fact that it's a larger company (not making any effort to distinguish themselves). Hopefully this is helpful for anyone that goes fishing out of San Diego.< /Text>

This store has a lot to offer the sporting enthusiast.  Everything from hunting gear, camping necessities, etc. To shoes.  The only problem here is that the staff are very unapproachable.  I needed help finding an item and  it one of them would come from behind the counter and assist m e< /text>

Called to see if item was at the store before I went. On hold for 16 + minutes while they looked for the item. It was a knife that was on ad.  It's not like they have knives in hidden places. Glass case with the guns and contains the knives. I finally hung up.   Terrible.</Text>

I I purchased a pepper gel today and when I bought it the lady told me to go into a field and discharge it and then it would be ready for use. I looked it up and that is not what you do that would make it to where it potentially didn't work when I needed it to.. crazy the practice spray is for that the actual spray is for an emergency only Don't listen to that woman in the pepper spray section.< /Review>

<text>You can find some really great deals here and a bonus if you have a coupon. It's not a huge store, but they do have the usual sporting goods store products. Last time I was there, they had beach cruisers on sale for $99.</text><Gmap_id>0x80deaae3fb8f9921:0xaf5453a0261d68bf< /Gmap_id></record>

Bought some nice flip flops and did some browsing. I usually go there for camping gear. Not too friendly customer service though. (That isn't the norm)< /review>

I have bought some equipments and hiking shoes here. And my wife bought active clothing.

The only thing about here is prices sometime is a little higher than costco, if costco has it. For example swimming goggles.

Good thing about here is, you can find any sports equipments here. You dont have to go couple stores to get your stuff .</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

< review>
I go to Big 5 when I want a good pair of athletic shoes ; they have some great sales however when you wear a large size ( 13 ) and have a large foot width 4AAAA, finding good walking shoes is very difficult and can also be extremely expensive, as I have found to be true and even if I get there before they open, I often strike out [ Darn it! What a great game however the Astro's won it - about 4 and 1/2 hours over 11 innings. Not to worry though, as the Dodgers will take it all and the pennant. ].
Big 5 has a great line of some of the finest fishing gear and I usually buy mine there however, I usually only need to buy extra equipment once or twice a year.
They have some nice guns however, Southern California certainly doesn't compare with Washington State  when it comes to bird hunting.
The store has a wide variety of "outdoor equipment for all outdoor activities and an extremely knowledgeable staff.<//review>

<Text>I have to say that I was a bit disappointed I have been shopping at big 5 for many years bought 3 pairs of tennis shoes two pair were exactly the same just different color charged a different price for one pair over the other  sales person in the shoe department did not inform me of this and was not displayed in price on shelf I still bought the shoes but walked out with a bad feeling.  Same though as maybe it was just a bad day as a look like there was 2 other people having issues with product or the store Long wait.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Understaffed. Store was not crowded but store personnel could not even handle us 3 shoppers. Only saw 2 workers. We had to locate items we came for ourselves but they were high up out of reach. It was unfair to the employees and to us.< /Review>

<text>I bought a bodyboard here last year. I bodyboard frequently and I loved the board. I went back to buy another bodyboard in July. The bodyboard broke after three uses(not Big 5’s Fault). I will went back without a receipt 2 months later to see if I could get store credit to purchase the original board that I loved. Although they did give me the store credit, their demeanor seemed like I was a burden and they were not enthusiastic at all to help me. Even the store manager came to the front so he could pull the receipt up from their system. Not even a “hello” or “I’m sorry” or “I am glad to help you”. The only thing he expressed to me was that I purchased a low quality board(the most expensive board they have) and I shouldn’t expect it to last very long. I politely told him that I had great success and longevity with another model that he carries at a lower price point. He didn’t aknwoege my response and walked into the back to get my receipt. I want to still shop here, but there is little to no quality customer service. Very disappointing.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Text>Just a chain store with employees. Sometimes their helpful, other times you go for shoes and you can hear them talking on the other side of the department door and they won't  come out and help you. Ok prices if you dont walk out in bewilderment. But there's not alot of choices anymore.<//Text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) Well, I imagine a local sports store, nothing to do with Academy or Dicks Sporting, but if it is half stocked, I went for a promotion that was sent to me from MLB caps and I didn't find anything, but the same to help the commerce of the area is good to visit.

(Original)
Pues es me imagino una tienda local de deportes, nada que ver con Academy o Dicks Sporting pero pues si está medio surtida, yo fui por una promoción que me mandaron de gorras de MLB y no encontré nada, pero igual para ayudar al comercio de la zona está bien visitarla.< /Review>
