I've been going here for 8 years. Just got my renewal notice and I'll be back there next week. I've never been there more than 20 min. Great Friendly staff and I'm sure my visit next week will produce the same results even with the times we are in. But if it take 30-40 min I'll be completely understanding as they have built a history with a happy Customer!<//Review>

<Text>Quick service and affordable prices. I was hesitant at first because I saw a bunch of cars in the parking lot. I had my kids with me and on this hot summer day I did not want a long wait. But to my delight my car smog certification was completed in under 20 minutes!< /Text>< name>

Best place to get maintenance done. Also a fast smog shop. I've been using this shop for nearly 3 years and have never been disappointed. They have done everything from an oil change to complete timing belt and head swap on my cars (4 cars total)! I love to drive older cars, because I like them better, so keeping these guys as my standard shop has been a great blessing. Not only that, but getting to know Marcel, Fred, and Jeff had been a pleasure.
If you need service on your car, or just a smog cert, use them. You'll likely have a great experience.< /Text>

I went here on a Wednesday morning. I arrived at 7:50am, 10 minutes before it was suppose to open (8:00am). First worker to show up for work arrived at 8:07am! A second worker arrived at 8:10am! And the gate was still not open! I left frustrated and went to another smog station down the road (and this station was open as advertised).<//Text>

<Text>This shop has always been kind and courteous with me and my family. Their mechanics know their trade well and are quick to offer solutions when problems with a vehicle arrise. I had an old truck that needed a smog before i sold it, so i brought it here. They had me out in 20 min with a pass! Then a car i brought in from out of state needed a smog for registration and i knew before i brought it in that there were some issues with it, but i needed to know more about what the problems were so i could address them. They looked over the car before they performed the smog and told me about some repairs that i needed. They were spot on with what i needed and im working to special order the parts and im having them install them! The price quotes are lower than other shops and since im a return customer they are reducing their already fair labor rates. I love these guys!!< /Text><Name>Cori Holman<//Name><GmapID>0x8091070981aae3ed:0x7d5568048e77af32< /GmapID><pics>None< /pics><Rating>5</Rating></record></dataset><record>

Before you go to this place be sure you call! Just because there are posted hours of operations, doesn’t mean that they are there.</Review>

Nice little ball field, bleachers and dugouts. Have both a snack bar and a food truck that specializes in (of course) hot dogs! Comfortable setting with trees shading much of the bleachers.<//Review>

People you meet now and then are friendly.  On the weekend, all of the flelds have games being played.</review>< Pictures>

This is one of the most pleasant Beauty Supplies I've ever patronized! This business is full of good, quality black haircare products...at reasonable prices. They're grateful to their customers and it shows.  With every purchase,  they give you a reusable face mask...Brand new and sealed! Working in the community to curb COVID and keeping businesses open! Kudos!< /text>

Staff makes you feel welcomed and they are helpful if you need help locating an item, which is exactly happened to me. This hair store is pretty large and has a large variety of hair, hair products and small things like nail polish and eyelashes (located in the check out area.)<//text>

I went to this establishment to purchase braiding gel, edge control, and braiding hair. What should have been a simple transaction turned into a nightmare, and ended with the manger failing to give me everything I purchased.
I returned to the store bright and early the next day, waited for the manager to get there and shakes him my receipt, as well as looked at the security tapes with him to prove I never left the store with the items. After admitting he couldn’t tell where he placed my items he refused to have BASIC CUSTOMER SERVICE and would not give me the items I paid for.

THIS HAIR STORE IS PREDOMINANTLY FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY, BUT LACKS RESPECT FOR ITS CUSTOMERS AND THE MONEY THAT WE SPEND THERE.
Please do not give your money to this establishment.</text>< date>

The owners here are not only rude, they are incredibly RACIST. They follow black women around the store assuming they will steal and yet expect those same women to continue patronizing their business. You should absolutely go to a different beauty supply store. I would NEVER step foot into this trash store again. I sincerely hope people read all of the reviews on this place because the refrain is the same. I urge you to find a different place shop and spend you more money more consciously than putting money into their pockets.< /review>

I only go to get what I need and get out. They have horrible customer service and they follow everyone around like they're thieves. No matter how much honest money you spend there.... And how polite you are about it. They also can not relate to the needs of women of all colors. Always a quick as possible visit. Lol. 😂</Review>

Owners are super racist. They make money off of black people but dont actually respect them. Following around stores, they tried to force me to leave my bag at the door bc it was "too big" even though I was walking to the cash register. DONT buy from here. If you can find a black beauty supply store nearby go there instead and support black businesses.< /Review>

<Text>This the most untrusting disrespectful hair supply stores in Antioch they think every Black person that shop there has to be a thief or a crook I gave him a $20 bill and he had it all in the air looking at it he said sometimes there hard to deposit,  so I said how in the hell is real money hard to deposit smdh.. Two women were shopping the whole time they shop they watch you like a hawk and when they left because they couldn't find what they were looking for before they left he stops them in there tracks and says so you don't want to buy nothing and they had to explain why they were leaving without purchasing anything.. So for now on I will just go to Sally's so I won't be harrassed by the Asia owners of this stereotype establishment< /Text></record>

<review>Very racist. Followed me and my daughter around the store and when I got to the register, the asian man asks me where is the other item I had in my hand which I put down in one of those aisles. Next thing I know, the asian woman knew exactly where I put it down at and brought it to the register. I then threw whatever else I was going to purchase down on the counter and left....I will never recommend that place to anyone. Very very very racist...</review>< Time>

They are racist and follow you every step you take , do not give them your business! It was a horrible experience and when you address them about it they yell and fight over you as if your business dose not mean anything< /Text>

Went there on a weekend road trip. It had a lot of interesting thing there. We learned about the history of oils drilling and ways we use the oil we pumped up. Our kids were amused.< /Text>

We take part in the Passport 2 History (look it up if you don't know about it) and three of the passport museums are within walking distance of each other in Santa Paula!  So my son and I took a day trip out to Santa Paula.  We visited all three museums starting with The California Oil Museum!

This FREE museum has a lot of stuff and has an excellent presentation!  What I liked best was that there are a ton of things for little kids to do... push buttons and stuff happens and what not.  There is a lot of cool antique gasolina here, signs, bulbs, etc.

You won't spend too-too much time here, but make this your first stop, park in the lot and make your way to the other museums as well.  A great day trip!<//Review>

<date>1549318672891< /date><Response>None</Response><Text>Small museum full of history. Is was our very girls museum in California and it was a great experience. The staff introduced us to their museum passport. (Worth $5) The passport is a book full of museums around California. It includes information about each museum and it has a place for you to collect their stickers/stamps. This is something great to do with kids and get them eager to visit museums. Be sure to stamp a time card when you walk in and walk out of this museum. It makes a great reminder of your experience.< /Text>< rate>

<Text>A small museum with the wider story of oil in California. The exhibits are truly eclectic, but relevant. There's everything from real history and toys, to machinery and films. Then there's also the staff - absolutely brilliant. They care about the subject, they know a lot and they are keen to pass on the information. I'm very pleased that I took time out to visit.<//Text><rate>4</rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user_name>Steve Tupper</user_name>< Response>

Great historical museum lots of old artifacts including a working full sized early oil well pump, antique gas pumps, detailed scaled model off shore oil drilling rigs! Make sure to see upstairs at the old union oil company offices! Very well restored! Pics to follow soon.<//Review>

Quaint museum, staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. Art museum is around the corner and is in walking distance to some cute shops downtown!
No matter how much they warn you about the sound of the oil rig in back, you will jump! LOL< /text>

The full size oil drilling setup from the 1900's is impressive, it is in the side building be sure not to miss it. Unfortunately when I was here the back gallery was closed to set up a new exhibit and we did not get to see the second floor that is only by docent-led tour. This made the museum kinda small so if you can go when those parts are open.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Really loved it this place could be so much more if they had more donations and funding but very interesting to stop in real quick it's small enough to be in and out within 45 minutes and that's looking at everything< /text>

<Review>Really cool for anyone who likes history. A lot of pictures and artifacts that illustrate how different life was for the early adopters of Santa paula and the oil industry in general. Obviously biased to make the oil companies look good, but when you keep that in mind it's still a fun and educational place to go. It's fun and cheap enough where I would go back. The tour of the original offices was my favorite part.< /Review>< Pics>

<text>The museum is smaller and more unknown than other more famous museums in the southern california area.  But this museum does capture an important part of the California history which is often forgotten.  Oil.  Many people, including myself grow up not knowing how oil shaped southern California and continues to do so.  Worth visiting if you're local to the area.  They have big displays of some of the equipment used in the past.  There's free parking.</text>< Pictures>

Really nice small-town museum, lots of local oil history came from this location. I liked the model of the drilling rig - very detailed and interesting.</review>

<Text>Let me put my 2 cents in here cause, i LOVE the seldom opportunities of being able to say positives of an establishment and/or its representatives. While I understand and can even agree that many places especially local/state/federal places can have a negative experience potentially attached to it, it doesn't mean they ALWAYS will. So concerning THIS particular post office, (especially being such a busy hub) I am honored and grateful to be able to shoutout two of its employees, Murphy and June. Both Murphy and June are People that engage the public (not always an easy job in any industry) and have my 5 star stamp of approval to the point that I will say the following.

1.)This facility could easily be a flagship training facility and represent how all places should be and...

2.) Sadly, I'm not wealthy but if I ever win a lotto or had a successful business,  I would offer them both the chance to fill out their check to bring them on board cause I demand the best and these two exemplify that entirely.

Lastly, I'd say thank you to both and to any others that put their best face on, even if they might not feel like wearing it at the moment. Thank you Murphy and June.
Will add names to this as I come across these experiences with others.

My package was due on the 23rd of February it’s now March 8th. This place had my package last. Zero updates , Zero feedback spent $85.00 on what’s in my package and I’m expected to be patient. Simple the Worst!< /Text>

Got the run around from 3 other post offices in the area - they kept cancelling our passport appts last minute, but this facility came through! Yolanda really went to bat for us and we felt like the staff went above and beyond to help us. Thank you!<//review>

We waited until he came back from lunch, but he said his working time is over so he refused to do it

Totally irresponsible!

and that man is the only person who can do it in the whole post office

Not only us, a lot of customers went there and cannot get their figure print

Why customer need to wait for him and still cannot get the service? Didn’t customer pay for it? Is he the god so that everyone needs to follow? If this post office cannot do the job, then just fire the man and let other post office to do it!< /text><Name>Bo Li</Name></record>

<review>The people who work at this office are very rude and snappy. Honestly seems like they don't like their jobs and there's a high turnover rate in general for the post office. The woman I spoke to today was automatically snapping at me before I could ask her my question or get to her from the line I was waiting it. Seems as if the employees get away with choosing who they can act rude with. Every time I leave this office I feel yelled at my the employees over basic questions that didn't involve that much stress to begin with.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Package I had ordered from new York.   Was delivered to the wrong address.   After being delayed for nearly a week.   (Even through tracking said it was in my mail box.  It wasn't.)   Absolutely horrible customer service!   Has a voice activated menus.  (And I have a speech impairment.   And is impossible for me to use effectively.)   And when I did finally get an option to speak to a live person.  Not even sure if it was the right dept.    The wait time was thirty to forty minutes.   These lazy SOB's owe me 24 dollars!   For the loss of the item I had purchased.   They are worse than the cable company and yes.  Even collection agency's.   As far as customer service goes.  Are fine as long as they work.  But if something screws up.  Watch out for these money grubbing creeps.  Always demanding more for stamps.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x808f80831751904b:0x100adf1b7cd26d6f<//Gmap_id><user_id>111824160784080185745</user_id><time>1512418549279<//time><name>David Young< /name><Pictures>None</Pictures><Rate>1<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

<text>I love that this hub is so accessible to us. Everything sent out from here seems to get to its destination faster.
The people are competent, friendly and efficient. They don't rush customers, but will ask that you stand to the side while you complete something in order to help the next customer.< /text><name>Ashea Fuller</name>< UserId.>

I asked a woman post officer at the desk  if she could advise me on how to send an iPad to a friend in Thailand. Her response was, "put it in a box and mail it." Then she added, "we don't package things for people here."
I said I didn't expect her to. So the first part would be funny if she was a comedian, but she was a postal worker who has experience, I assume, on how to package things, such as, a.) what would be the right box and b.) how much does it cost to send different ways, and c.) is there a customs form I need to fill out....etc. etc. After waiting in line for a good 20 minutes, this woman was not much of a help.</Review>

<Name>Day P< /Name><text>The Postal Workers here are very nice and very well experienced.  I have an online business so, I often have last minute orders so, if I have an Express Mail or if I can wait until after 5:00pm to send it with First Class mail then, I much prefer to take my packages over to this office in West Oakland. It might be a little out of the way but, it's open until 8:30pm and always has 3 people working the counter (sometimes 4) so, rarely is there a line (overall, much faster than all other East Bay locations) which is especially great during the holidays! This office decorates during the seasons and they  also manage the "Secret Santa" gift program, collecting letters to the North Pole every year. They do such a great job!<//text><gmapID>0x808f80831751904b:0x100adf1b7cd26d6f</gmapID>< rate>

Nice people working there but SSSSLLLLLOOOOOOOWWWWWW. I got there maybe ten minutes after they opened and it took me an hour to pick up a certified letter. The man behind the counter was friendly but took a long time and was not very efficient: rather than ask each individual person in line what they needed to pick up, he should have asked several people and grabbed all their parcels at once. Would have saved him the trips and all of us the time. He seemed a little crazy, too: talking to himself and the packages the entire time yet unable to make eye contact with the people.< /text>

<Text>I went here to pick up a load of mail going to washington state. As soon as i went onto the dock i was treated as some second rate person and told if i didn't hurry up and back in i would be charged with delay of federal mail. Usps is 100% subsidised by the us taxpayer and is out of their mind if they think they can treat their carriers the way they do. I hope all of you are replaced by FedEx and Amazon and find yourselves without jobs on street corners.</Text><Date>1512768381481< /Date>< gmapID>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Great park. Half court hoop, two tennis courts, playground, pleanty of space to play on grass, walking path in and around park,plenty of shade. No indoor bathroom but a porta potty (parks dept didnt budget it for some reason). Picture I'm adding is of David A Simpson who the park is named after. As a gift to the city for naming a park after him he asked that a Flagpole be installed and he and his family agreed to change out the flags (American flag and P.O.W flag) whenever they become tattered. Enjoy the park!!< /text>< pics>

But, if you have small kids and/or dogs, it's perfect. There are also tennis courts, basketball ball hoops, and a baseball field. There is an area for soccer but the nets are in bad shape or are missing. I'd give it 5 stars if it were better maintained, the trash was emptied regularly (it's not) and the grass wasn't so muddy. There are a lot of mature trees that brings a ton of shade but, as a result, there is poor drainage and is typically muddy.</Review>< gmapID>

I can't believe that you tracked my phone to this park. I was taking a walk  to help me recover from a serious surgery and walked to the park as a goal. Wow that's messed up, shame on you Big Brother is watching!< /review>

I pay $6000 property tax but it seems like the park facility is too old. My daughter still enjoyed here because this is the only one walking distance to my house.<//Text>

<review>I happened upon this place and was so pleasantly surprised. By far the best empenadas I have had. Tasty, satisfying, and worth the money. They are filled with good stuff, not just dough.
I'll be back to try them all 🙂</review>< Pics>

<text>I saved this place after watching a show. Looked and sounded like a great place. It totally lived up to the hype. I got the lamb, a chicken, and an Italian sausage (3 empanada special) with a bottled water. Friendly staff. This food was life. The meat was tender. The spices... yum. The dipping sauce. Yum. I highly recommend this place and will make a return visit next time I’m in town.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPl3NLWwVtomtrR6uVN6RBlRAnLEf2YbUBMXxdv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7c8bU6yLJcXCtrDHyKeGP7U-uaUyDj589Kil8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1bNYVdpfPVspB1H5uanh5zT3WAL2QTyFmodWy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNufK-W25jCQqto1QjpoccnZsxjSpH5516x5X4w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

Please do yourself a favor and come eat here. I'm blown away by the unique and intense flavors in the spicy beef and the chicken empanadas when paired with the chimichurri sauce. For the price, I think what you get is very generous. They've also got some tables outside.<//Review>

Tried this place for the first time today and decided on the mushroom & goat cheese empanada and the beef empanada. They are delicious especially accompanied by the spicy chimichurri sauce. I definitely will go back to try the corn & basil and the chicken empanada. So delicious!< /Text>

Our first time trying empanadas, and what a place to start. The 5-star yelp reviews don't lie, these are SO good!! Our recommendations, try the sweet corn and caprese! Thank you @empanadakitchensd! Please open a location in Vancouver!< /Review>

What a find!  Excellent empanadas in the East Village!  Spanking shiny clean with friendly staff. Empanadas are BAKED (not fried) and just delicious. I had breakfast - bacon and egg - will fluffy egg, flaky pastry and piping hot. Can’t wait to try my second choice - mushroom and goat cheese - next time.< /Text>

I'm pretty disappointed. I thought empanadas would be made fresh. But the food we ordered was sitting out for a while on display and I think it was heated up in a microwave... I think that pretty much speaks for itself on how the food taste</review>

<Review>Bright and cheerful place with indoor and outdoor seating and big bar-height tables. I wouldn't call the ambience cozy, like the places that invite you to linger and keep ordering. It's more of an eat-and-go place, where you won't go wrong with anyting you pick from the menu. And their mini alfajores are absolutely delicious!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<review>I had the mushroom & goat cheese, also a lamb empanada. Both were delicious. And at under $10 for such a filling pair, it's a steal in the downtown area.
Friendly & fast service, so it's perfect if you're on the go. Treat yourself.</review>< Time>

<Review>Empanadas don’t get any better than this from my experiences. So many places I have tried in San Diego have quite dry empanadas and I end up drowning them in sauce to make up for that. But these empanadas are so incredibly moist and flavorful and the chimichurri complements the flavors so well. Best empanadas you will find in San Diego IMO!</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

We ordered 24 half beef, half chicken for Mother's Day. While I was waiting, I was offered a sample which was egg. It was so good. Can't wait to try the rest. The environment inside Empanada Kitchen is so inviting. Street parking is almost non-existent though. There is a giant pay parking lot across the street. The front of this restaurant is asking the trolley tracks so be careful.</review>

<text>Nice variety of baked empanadas, including a vegan option. Be sure to get the chimichurri sauce. Basically a hole-in-the-wall kind of spot with a few tables of indoor and outdoor seating. Good value for lunch or dinner.</text>< pictures>

We work close by and we come here almost everyday for lunch. We always get the beef, vegan and Ham and cheese empanadas. They are a perfect balance between protein, vegetables, cheese, and dough... and best of all they are baked and not too heavy so we don't get fat.< /Review>

A fav spot for Argentinian food. Great place to relax, people watch, eat good food or all the above.  The place has an awesome feel to it. Kinda of like a cafe in Phoenix that I enjoyed.</Text>

As an Argentine who's lived in the US for almost 30 years, I've always had to settle for empanadas that were "good enough for not being in Argentina". Not any more...

Absolutely incredible empanadas! Had the beef, chicken, and sweet corn basil. I’d recommend all of them.

...but almost better than the food, the customer service. The man behind the counter was a standup, genuinely nice guy. Super appreciated!<//Review>

Friendly counterserve spot for tasty empanadas, not exceptional but a good and reasonably priced option if you're in the neighborhood. Maybe I've been spoiled by authentic home made experiences but the five star ratings give too high an expectation.</review>

<Name>Jonathan Adler< /Name><time>1578436600600< /time><rating>5< /rating><review>EK is a very nice looking, very clean Arge ntinean restaurant with bright yellow and white decor.

Scott, the Asst. Manager, has a super great attitude being very courteous with me and all other customers I observed.

I had a nice variety of Empanadas including sausage, lamb, beef, corn and my favorite ham & cheese.

Their chimichurri sauce is phenomenal.

They also sell delicious Kombucha-my blood orange, ginger was amazing.

Bump coffee and Argentinean Alfajores cookies finished my adventure here with flying colors.

I rate EK best Empanadas in San Diego.</review>< pictures>

This is a simple, clean, attentive place. The staff is nice and the menu has a variety with more than one vegetarian option. It's 3.50 for one empanada, but there are combo and bulk options. The size of each is not that large, the meal of 3 could fill you, but if you are really hungry than maybe not.

I tried the veggie, corn, and mushroom ones. My favorite was the corn, it had the most flavor, but then all of them did had flavor and tasted good. The only thing is that they seemed a little burnt, but nothing too bad. Still a good option for a food that's not widely available in SD.<//text>

<text>This place is so good. I'm pretty sure they use a different kind of dough because their empanadas are super light.
If it's your first time going make sure to get the lamb and get their homemade chimichurri.</text>< date>

I cannot adequately describe the joy I get everytime i get to stop by here. These little pillows of happiness are always delicious and satisfying. I love to try the different seasonal flavors they offer but you can't go wrong with the classic beef. Get the chimichurri!< /Review>

They were amazing! I went in and asked for something as close to what my Nannie from Chile made well I was a child. They knew exactly what I wanted and were so right on the authenticity of the beef empanada. Thank you!</Review>

<text>The Empanadas are fantastic, especially the Applie pie one! Customer service was also commendable. There was only 1 person working the counter and he was moving as fast and efficiently as he could and then hooked us up with some freebies for waiting.</text>< pics>

Soooooooo gooooood! The Ham and Cheese is too good. I don’t know how they pack so much flavor in them, but they sure do. Everyone there is very friendly and I never feel rushed.

Give this place a shot when you’re in the neighborhood :)< /Text>

This is a little spot that could not stay at the Farmer’s Market. I found this place after speaking to a Brazilian restaurant owner who said I had to try this Argentinian flavor so glad I did.The Empanadas, especially the Italian Sausage and pesto, were delicious! Yes this comes from the tapas tradition, so friends, flavors, sharing, bites are waiting. I had the lunch special with two empanadas and a salad. It was quick and delicious!<//text>

I recommend wearing something over your clothes to catch the juices because these little pies like to sqirt no matter how carefully you bite.
The empanadas were a lot smaller than I was expecting but they were little powerhouses of flavor.
Usually I hate pie and pastry crusts enough to pick them off and eat only the fillings but these actually tasted quite good and had a nice flaky yet slightly chewy texture.
I highly recommend the 3 I tried, especially the mushroom.< /text>< Pictures>

Pricey for one empanada, but helping a small company grow is worth it, and the flavor compensates for the price! Love this place a lot and would come over and over again.<//Text>< Pictures>

I liked the place it was clean I liked the selection and the layout of the place. But the empinadas lack a certain zing to them. We all left pretty unsatisfied. They don't give you that full up feeling. And they felt kinda just bland. But try em.< /Review>

Have to share about the exquisite empanadas at Empanadas Kitchen in downtown SD! Lots of Argentinian classics (beef, lamb, etc) as well some American twists (apple pie, ham and cheese, mushroom and goat cheese.) You can eat 2, maybe 3, maybe 4! Each one is around 3 or 4 bucks. HIGHLY recommended comfort food 🏆<//review>

We used to buy their empanadas at our local farmer’s marker and were pretty devastated when we couldn’t find them any longer... Then we realized they had opened their own place! Their selection of empanadas is great as well as the value of their combo meals. The owner and staff are super friendly and we love supporting them. If you want a nice portable snack or hearty meal look no further.<//Text>

Empanda Kitchen made a large order of 5 different empanadas for an event we hosted on the weekend.  We picked up the empanadas early on a Sat morning.  They were fresh, hot, and came with instructions.  Dan, the owner, is a nice guy and made sure that we had everything we needed for our event!  We found out about this young business through word of mouth, and we will be signing their praises to others in the future.  The mushroom got cheese is to die for!< /review>

This is a kitchen that makes empanadas.

Really good ones too.

We got two 3 for $9 deals so we could try 6 of the flavors.

Our favorites were the ham and cheese and the beef.

<review>love the fresh empanadas, I can't believe they are baked and hand-rolled. There are a dozen types with cute unique shapes.

I enjoyed the Spinach Empanada so much that I went back the next day and got the Corn with Bechamel Sauce Empanada and the Mushroom and Goat Cheese Empanada. All 3 were really savory and flavorful, but the spinach was my favorite!

The Chimchurri sauce is quite zesty! I enjoyed dipping the empanadas into the vinegar and spices, it gave the empanadas a nice kick.

The empanadas are quite filling, I'm stuffed after eating 2. Over a dozen  delicious vegetarian and tasty meat options to choose from!< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

OMG the caprese Empanada is aaaamaaaaaazing. Pair it with chimichurri. I just couldn't go and eat one, minimum 3 ! It's such a cozy restaurant and there's public parking right in front, so that was ideal too!< /Text>

<pics>None< /pics><Time>1526091349467</Time><Review>Very good potential. Maybe this place is best at lunch. Went at about 6:30pm and they had most empanadas still available. That was good. Got the ratatouille, daily special Italian sausage, ham n cheese, goat cheese and mushroom, and chicken. Ingredients inside were very flavorful and hit the spot. I was pleased with the portion size and value.

I would have preferred a crispier crust on most of the empanadas. They sit in a heated cabinet waiting to be pulled for orders. I think they could easily add a quick air fryer prior to serving, to heat up the filling a bit more and also that would crisp up the exterior a bit. That would elevate this place a bunch.

Also the chimichurri side is a bit lacking. It's too vinegary and watery. Totally not a dipping sauce and basically not what most would think of as a chimichurri sauce. Not green. If they offered maybe a few dipping options, I could see that being a big plus to complement various flavors of empanadas.</Review><userid>114450886917289319592</userid>< Rating>

Having subsisted on empanadas daily in Argentina, Empanada Kitchen's are awesome - much tastier and better crafted than other shops in SD I've tried and their chimichurri is fantastic!< /text>< Pics>

The line was longer than I was willing to stand in. I called to make an order instead, but it was going to take over an hour to pick it up. So, I called the See's closer to my home and it only took about 15 mins for my order to be ready. So, nothing really bad about this store, it's the holidays so of course it's going to be busier. I was just able to fulfill my needs at another location in a timelier manner.<//text>

When the person accompanying me threw a fit about masks, they were more patient than I could ever be. I feel like they had dealt with disruptive customers before and were doing the best to de-escalate the situation. Sending love and kindness to the employees, and thanks for their cooperation for a situation they shouldn't have to be in.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

$26.50 to make your own box, totally outrageous.  But good!< /Text>

I felt like I was in Willy Wonka's storefront kitchen! The store is rather large and exceptionally spic and span. Everything is perfectly organized and all the displays are beautiful and immaculate. The two employees that waited on me were also of confection perfection! They were kind, helpful, patient and all smiles. There was a steady stream of customers, everyone seemed so happy. I'll definitely be going back! Oh, the free sample was lavished upon me even when I didn't ask for one. This company certainly knows how to hold its own thru the ages... Btw, I don't eat sugar and I HIGHLY recommend the dark chocolate/walnut sugar free chocolates! 😋< /Text>

The guy that greeted me was kinda rude. Still love their candy! But he didn't need to act that way! I didn't know you had to order online then pick me. Gosh, sorry!< /review>

Everything at See's is delicious, though. They also give everyone who visits a free sample to savor while you figure out what else you want.

If I still ate sugar, I'd be here every week.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Best chocolates in America.  Better than Godiva, teuscher, and all the other so called  fancy chocolates.  Sees is still the best and there is no business that even comes close.</Text>

Dr San Juan is just what Watsonville needed! She is a highly skilled compassionate dentist. She has all the updated technology in her office to make dental work, X-rays, photos etc a breeze for the patient. She and her fantastic staff...Erica (Dental  Assistant Extraordinare!)  Maria (Dental Hygenist ) and Danielle ( Receptionist, Insurance Referrals & Biller) make your experience perfect. As a 35+ year patient of Dr Vanderbilt’s I just know he is proud to have Dr Ivette San Juan carrying on new and innovative dental treatments in Watsonville! The office is beautiful and inviting! I recommend anyone looking for a new dentist to give Dr San Juan’s office a call!< /Review>

<Review>Very cute and super clean  practice and they follow the COVID-19 regulations to make a safe visit for everyone . Staff is very friendly and the vibe at the office is amazing . You actually walk into a place where people love each other and there job . Maria cleaned my teeth and was super amazing . And Erica and Dr. San Juan gave me so much information about the Invisalign and didn’t push me to get things I didn’t want and answered any questions I had . Definitely will be returning 💕< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Dr. San Juan was very accommodating and sensitive to my fear of getting dental procedures done. She was kind and caring and offered several things to help me feel at ease. I would highly recommend her for anyone who is looking to have dental work done and has a fear of dentists!  Erika, her assistant, told me everything they were doing and was comforting as well. If you need your teeth cleaned, ask for Jen! She’s the only person who has cleaned my teeth where my gums aren’t sore for days after! She is highly trained and an excellent hygienist!</review>

I just have to say that  Dr. San Juan and her staff are incredible! I’ve had several different dentist over the past 3 years and since the first moment I met her I felt completely comfortable!  The entire staff is warm, professional, and welcoming! Her care and attention to detail is exceptional.
Thank you Dr. San Juan , Erika, Danielle, and staff for all you do.  You light up the office with your smiles.

<review>The office staff are very friendly. The hygienist asked you about any concerns.  I have very sensitive teeth she make sure to be careful around that area of my mouth. Any requests that I ask for, she did it. For example, I asked her if she could go over certain areas and she did. I was very pleased.</review></record>

My husband, Pete, was the patient. He is 94, blind and had been experiencing anxiety attacks recently. He was concerned about going to a new dentist (our first visit). Everyone in this office, including Dr. San Juan, were very kind, gentle, helpful, efficient and the extraction was painless. We are confident that we have a new dentist.< /text>

Many empty shops make parking easy here but a little shifty at night. The businesses here are good and need local support.</review>

If this was the mall where I bought my new 4 prong stand alone walking cane & priced the fancy nova walkers, Chino Medical Store, then I love it!!! I use my cane exclusively now, preferably over my old cane, I take it everywhere!! I may return for the extended grabber selection they have, I saw no less than 5 different choices hanging there!!!<//Review>

The staff is amazing. They're patient and explain procedure in detail and most importantly they take care of my child. Kid friendly, thank God.<//Text>

Love this dentist100% all the staff is very nice and professional. I think I felt more nervous than my child walking in lol but the staff made me feel so comfortable that I truly trust my child in their care. The whole office is kid-friendly with music movies, and wonderful Disney art on the walls to make a kid just have the best experience.<//Text>

The staff was so friendly and informative on everything being done on my 5 yr old son. My son was very calm during the procedure and I honestly think it had to do with the nurse who coached him through out the process and that I was allowed in the room with him. We will be keeping this Dental office as our go to office.<//review>

I have come here with my smaller children and each time they are very thoughtful about what to say to them. they are very caring when it comes to making the kids happy they always reassure them that they are going to be okay. Overall it's a good dentist that treats its younger patients well.</text>

The nurse and Dr. Where great. They kept my little girl calm trough the whole process.
She got 4 crowns and 1 extraction and she said she didn't feel pain. Thank you nurse Loraine you are a professional with the kids.
Dr. Smit  was quick really good work.<//Review>

<rate>1< /rate><text>I’m very upset because I took 3 of my kids , 2 of them had cavities, the debris never spoke with me about the procedures he had his assistant explain everything and she forgot to mention that my son will be having an extraction, she told me about 2 cavities and that’s all. They closed the door because he was screaming , when they opened the door they gave me his tooth and I asked them how come they didn’t tell me about the extraction, well the dental assistant told me that she did, but I think I would’ve remembered that they would mention extraction of an unnecessary tooth that wasn’t even loose or had cavities on it , because I would’ve said no. They trying to get paid for unnecessary procedures. Also for my daughter they said she had an abscess but she had no signs of infection, no pain or swollen gums, the dentist didn’t even talk to me about it, they just said they had to extract them and that’s all, I feel like she went through that for nothing, her baby front teeth weren’t even loose yet, they just pulled them out seconds after the anesthesia, didn’t even wait for it to kick in. They also placed a huge mouth piece that could nearly fit, it was so big she kept gagging so they poured salt in her mouth so she could stop gagging, her little eyes got swollen with broken vessels due to the gagging. I feel like the dentist needs to be the one to explain the procedures, it’s part of his job. I work in the medical field and the doctor should always be  the  one to explain everything not the assistant. Also he needed to wait longer for the anesthesia to kick in and ask her if she could feel anything before just pulling her teeth out, I think she felt all the pain because she screamed. Never taking them to this place again. They should really give you an option of giving zero stars in these types of reviews.<//text>< date>

I called with a week in advance to schedule and appointment for Saturday at 10:30 am. That week two days before someone calls me to confirm my appointment but with the wrong time so it was corrected after the call. Then the next day they call me again to confirm once again with the wrong time. But at the end of the call it was corrected again. Saturday comes I show up about 10 mins early thinking I have to fill out paper works but the perks was it was basic info which I loved. Sadly the wait room is crowded and I’m asked to wait in my car. As mentioned my appointment is at 10:30 20 mins pass my appointment I walk back in to ask for my I’d and insurance card because what is the point of having an appointment if they are not going to respect your time. Then both ladies in the front try to explain that weekends are busy so I respond with so it’s pointless to have an apartment if it’s not going to be at that time. The layers were great this post is just to say how unorganized they are calling to confirm went time twice only to not respect my appointment. Wish I could review the Dentist work.</Text>

It's my first time coming this office, running away from another dental office that has been getting worst and worst by the day. I'm so relief to say that I've found the perfect dental office for my two daughters. Upon arriving, we noticed how clean and well organized the office was. Staff at the front desk was really helpful and friendly. When it was time for my girls to go inside, staff treated them in a very welcoming and friendly way. I saw how comfortable they felt right away. Procedures that needed to be done were explained with detail. I'm going to say that this dental office exceeded my expectations, we will definately be coming back for our follow ups here. Thanks for the great service staff!<//Text>

< Review>
They are so good with my 2 year old and 11 year old, my son use to be afraid but now as soon as he feels pain he asks me to go to the dentist. I can call anytime and make an emergency appointment for the next day and we get in right in. I would not go anywhere else. Give it a try and you will not regret it. The office is nice and clean, so are the restrooms and the staff is friendly and helpful. The dentist and assistants have been so patient with my son and it’s no wonder he’s no longer afraid. Thank you Super Kids Dental.</Review>

<review>First time here and I love it. Everyone from the receptionist, X-ray tech, dental assistant to the Dr. so friendly and was seen fast, I usually dislike coming to the dentist because your waiting for hours but they were pretty fast here and great customer service also very clean. I will definitely be coming back. Thanks everyone at super kids dental! You all are GREAT!!</review>< Date>

Super kids dental is a great place for children. I was fortunate to find this place in which my children had a great experience.  Staff was well trained with good costumer service. I will not hesitate to continue with this dental office. I highly recommend. Maria was polite and courteous!< /review>

<Review>Typically it’s difficult to find a dentist that my son is comfortable going to, but we have been here twice and it’s pretty seamless. He is much more happy coming here and I believe it’s because of the cheerful and patient staff. The assistants are quite friendly especially Lorraine she knows how to run the program so my son doesn’t get too antsy.</Review></record>

Not to sound cliché, but this Dental group is one the best I've been to. They work really well with kids, especially Ms. Aleida C. who was extremely helpful and kind to my little one. Thank you for your excellence service.</Review>

Had a great experience with my 11 year old. Went to different locations to try and get his tooth taken out because of infection and they didn’t hesitate to help me out:. My son loved the place. I recommend it.< /text>

An absolutely AMAZING kids dental place. I highly recommend this place. I cannot thank the staff enough for such a great experience my son had at the dentist. The doctor was kind. Staff is super friendly, and knowledgeable who made my son feel welcome and safe. Thank you once again!< /review>

This place is amazing! I really am picky for my kids and wanted nothing but the best for them. I looked into various of dentals but couldn't find anything good until I came across Super Kids Dental. My 3year old daughter is extremely shy and tends to cry when she is around new people. But here was no problem! I was so amazed how Esme made her feel so happy and like if they new each other for years! She was so gentle and so nice to her and made her feel at home throughout the whole process. Debbie was also so good with keeping her happy through the X-ray. Not once did she cry. Same goes for my 2 year old son. He had such a great experience. I'm literally amazed how great everyone was here. I would highly recommend any parent to bring your kids here. You won't be disappointed l, trust me.<//Text>

<review>I brought my 2 Kids last week my son had 2 cavities I was very nervous because he's never had any cavities before but I knew they had to be fixed. During the whole procedure my son was very relaxed and didn't even cry thanks to Esmeralda and the Dr. they continuously were talking to him, my kids and I left super happy. At the end of our visit my kids got some rewards for being awesome. Best kids office in town!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

This place is awsome, Dr. Smit and Esmeralda are a good team.  The doctor has a very good hand and Esmeralda is very good with children.  I highly recommend this place for your dental needs when it comes to children they are the best. We most definitely are coming back.</Text>

Don’t recommend this place if you can take you kids somewhere else do so, now I understand why they only do kids! My kids had the worst experience ever on one of my sons they left him with a horrible smile when they supposed to leave them with a nice smile now he can’t smile I regret bringing them here! And my daughter all hurt from all her gum she wouldn’t stop bleeding! Like I said now I understand why they do kids and why they have them straps to tied the kids up makes perfect sense!<//Text>

<Text>Now this is the right way to really run a business The business owner obviously is doing something right. She is obviously blessed she has coming to her in her helping people out. I want to send my blessings to this business and it will keep on growing more and more. I would highly recommend anyone to come to this location and just see at the a customer service they treat you like you're a home or better than your home.  It makes me happy seeing businesses like this succeed in conquering their goal. By the way my name is  Mario   Gonzalez my wife karina Gonzalez.  I want to wish you the best and keep on moving up.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< userid>

<review>This is a GREAT dental clinic ! I had previously gone to the office on 4th st/Soto st and was really disappointed with the office staff. . I was referred from Super kids dental staff to their office on S. Atlantic and I have to say the experience we had today is more than what I expected. The office staff are Awesome! Front office staff very nice and respectful! Back office staff are Great!  Very friendly dental assistants ! They had a great interaction with my kids ! My kids loved the experience and said they want to come back soon ! I am really happy with how they were efficient, no wait time, clean, and most important very very friendly!</review>< Pictures>

The staff is the best the assistants talk with your children and comfort them every step of the way so does the doctor. Its bad enough the kids and parents both are nervouse and having the staff communicate in such a caring way really helps. Plus they have great toys your kiddos will love.</text>

I want to sincerely Thank everyone from Kids Super Dental. As a Walk-in /last minute I took my 2 girls for the first time. They needed treatment, I was so worry about them having a traumatizing experience... it was a clean environment with a very pleasant staff who took good care of us, but overall they were able to work with me and accomodate to my needs. Once again THANK YOU!<//Text>

i’ve been here a couple of times and i’ve really enjoyed it. Especially today! I was really nervous but all the doctors that were working on me made me feel safe. The doctors take their time to get to know their patients and laugh along with them! I recommend this dentist to everyone.< /Review>

I am very thankful with all the staff at this dental office, always very courteous and friendly,   my daughter had really bad experience with other dental office,  and when we came here they have really taken the time and go above and beyond with extra care and patience with her.  I'm am really glad she overcome her fears and that I found this place.</review>

<review>I've been bringing my kids to this dentist for about 2 years and I love it! The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. My kids love it here the examination rooms are adorable and it's a plus they have tv's for the kids to watch while getting work done (the tv's are facing down toward the kids).I definitely recommend this dentist office. Shout out to Debbie in xrays and Esperanza and Edith in the examination rooms! You girls rock!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2cf9eb96d7bd5:0xada854e0acc11dd0</GmapID></record>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>This dental office is horrific! Took my son there for his regular check-up and they made us wait for over an hour even though we came 10 minutes before our appointment time. What's the point of making an appointment if I have to wait for over an hour so the dentist can spend 5 minutes on my child? This is the second times it happened and I can't believe that they have the nerves to said it's normal to wait for over an hour to be seen. My time as well as other parents time are just as valuable as the dentists. It's unethical that they over booked patients and waste our time just so they can make some extra money! By writing this review, I hope it will help parents to better understand that don't let this office bully you.</text>< Pics>

<Response>{'time': 1540676258463, 'text': "Dear My Uyen Ta, sorry about your bad experience at our dental office.  Unfortunately any kids dental office that has been around for a few years does have a pretty high volume of patients, especially in the late afternoons and weekends.  This is mainly due to shortage of there being enough pediatric dentists out there.  Waits can also be caused by the unpredictability on the amount of work that a particular patient needs.  Some just need 5 minutes of work and some 1 hour.  If you would like to cut down on your wait, weekday mornings are the best time to visit a pediatric dentist assuming you will be able to receive a permission from your child's school."}</Response>< gmap_id>

The office and rooms are clean. Kids can play freely in the lobby. Service is faster than usual dentists. People are nice and have a good mood, everyone can talk with you and they ask you if you have any problems and a sticker. The people are talkative. 👍 Buuuut sometimes they do take a looooooong time<//text>

< Review>
It was great experience for my kids, my 5 year old had been at least to 3 diferent places before and she was terrified to go see the dentist. We went to Super kids dental and also took my 1 year old for his 1st visit to the dentist and eventhought it was packed and we waited for 45 minutes, the staff was friendly and the place was beautiful. Overall our favorite dentist we're definitely going back.</Review>

Today I took my son in for his regular check up, found out he has some cavities, he is typically  nervous when it comes to the dentist. But the assistant Lorraine was so good with my son that by the end of today's visit he wasn't nervous at all. Thank you Super Kids Dental😁< /Text>

I highly recommend this place. I was with western dental for 9 yrs and every time I had an Appt with moly kids we would wait for than 3 hrs. They are so nice very organized. Esme was such a lovely girl to my kids love her attitude. Dr smit was also awesome. It was my 1st time here and hope to be my kids dentist for several yrs. thank u girls< /Review>

<Review>Great place from interior to staff. They were all friendly and very compasionate with children. My daughters had some cavities taken care of and some teeth extracted. In no time they were wondering around without any pain or dicomfort. I highly recommend Super Kids Dental.<//Review><Name>Rigo Gaytan< /Name></record></dataset><record>

I brought my son in a couple of weeks ago and I was so nervous because I had a bad experience myself but this place is so awesome with not just the kids but parents as well . My son needed work done and the ladies that helped him did such a good job and was done so quickly I loved it. Will be coming back.</Text>

<Review>As a patient, I felt like they informed me a lot about how to properly care for my teeth. The dental assistants were very nice and patient with me especially in xrays (debbie) and the assistant that brushed my teeth (salma). After my treatment, i realized it is important to brush my teeth after meals and mornings and nights. Salma taught me how to floss and edith gave me chances to not move during my treatment and i did well (I did not move at all).</Review>< Pics>

<text>Hmm, i dont know about this place! I took my kid's here and seems bit off!!! I took my kid's here and had some work done but one of my kid needed a root canal which never gave me referral paper or number to call, i called super kids dental back and they gave me a number to call & the referral place told me they only work with kid's 13 and up ? My son is 11 But they told me they will give me a call to set appoiment, well 3 weeks later they never called! Im just thinking they wanted to take money out of my insurance. Well im taking my kid's to my previous dental office get second opinion.<//text><GmapID>0x80c2cf9eb96d7bd5:0xada854e0acc11dd0</GmapID></record>

< Review>
It was my first time taking my daughter to Super Kids Dental & the experience was amazing!! My daughter loved the rooms with beautiful hand painted characters on the wall! She didn't cry at all & the staff are super friendly & welcoming! They gave my daughter a McDonald's gift card, coupon for a Shakey's individual pizza, a free 5oz Yogurtland coupon, coupon for a Baskin Robbins ice cream, and a coupon for free tokens at Chuck E. Cheese! We're definitely returning for her 6 month check up!<//Review>

<Time>1514927582423< /Time><Rate>5</Rate><text>This place is great! Office is clean and every RM has different Disney characters painted on them they have Disney music playing while waiting went in on Saturday with my daughter and she had the best experience , the assistant Ramon really made her feel comfortable along with Dr.Smit. My daughter has had 2 major procedures in the past one was great and the other wasn't which left her feeling very scared of going to a dental office, which is why when she came here the first time couple months before she felt nervous and terrified did not want them to place what they call snowflakes to make sure she would get no cavities in the future but this time around she did great! Ramon was talking to her while the procedure was going on referring to caps as Cinderella cap or Repunzel and for the sugar bug( cavitie) he would say lady bug or butterfly which really made her not get scared he also did not wrap her completely which made her feel more safe as well. I'm so glad there is great staff here because kids need to feel safe and welcomed especially while getting a major procedures the more you talk to the child the more comforting they feel. Definitely recommend this place!! And kids get chuke cheese tokens last time she received McDonald's gift card and this time she got one for baskin Robbins and yogurt land how awesome is that! I'm so happy my daughter is no longer scared of the dentist. Thank you Super Kids Dental she is sugar bug free< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Thanks to everyone for the great service, my daughters are always happy to go to their appointments with their dentists because they are very kind and make us feel very good. Thanks to Esmeralda for making my girl feel calm and I do not cry, they talk to them with a lot of patience and leave very happy. See you next appointment. Thank you.
