<Rating>1< /Rating><text>Generally going to a Bank of America is dreadful but this one stands out. The representatives here are absolutely careless. The lines are ridiculously, you will wait for an hour; not exaggerating. Today I go in (there's a huge line of course) to get a temporary debit card because my replacement will come in 4 days. Well the representative tells me they can only help me with an appointment. But the appointments are for the following week! It's faster to just wait for the debit to come in the mail than for these people to help you get a temporary, that's just stupidly ridiculous!<//text>< pics>

<Review>The worst Bank of America location... there is a lady "hostess" CINDY ANGEL or something like that and she told me "we can't help you here, you need to call the call center" just because I came to the bank at 5:30 pm and they close at 6. I thought the client were the most important for this bank, but they need to REMEMBER this bad Customer Service Representative that THE CLIENT ARE FIRST... and not her damm time... she need to learn how to deal with the clients first and if she doesn't know how to help, PLEASE LET ANOTHER PERSON TO DO IT...<//Review>< Response>

<text>I was here for over an hour with my mom making line to deposit my check with a teller. After an hour of having technical issues Ivan, a worker there, decides to inform us that they are having technical difficulties. That we weren’t going to be helped. We had a line that stretched almost out the door and we were literally the next people coming up. If they knew they were having problems why not inform us before making line or wait an hour later to let us know. I don’t even understand how a Well names bank like this one is having issues like this. But things happen right. My point is that they handled this very wrong and I am very upset that they let me waist an hour of my time.</text></record>

I am extremely disappointed in the low level of customer service that this bank provides. First of all we waited over 40 min until we saw the manager wearing a bright pink shirt and my mom said "why isn't anyone helping us there are plenty of people and they aren't doing anything!" So what got me pissed off was that the manager smarta**ed my mom and told her and I quote " mam I can assure you everyone has something to do you can do 2 things 1 wait again until somone is available or 2 leave the bank!" I was so mad the treated die and my mom like shi* I was finally called the and Banker had no idea on how to do what I had asked so he called thier support line that walked him step by step the bank wasn't clean employees were being lazy! All lead by horrible attitude managers I will definitely contact corporate! Go to another bank not this one!<//Text>

I walked in here at 9:05 on Saturday to get a cashier's check and the line was almost out the door. Poor tellers. There were only two of them and obviously and large, recurring demand. I hopped on over to the nearest alternative BOA location at Olympic/Western and behold, no line and more tellers. Something is off here...</text>

< Review>
Honestly what I appreciate most about living here is the people in the office. The staff is so kind and outgoing. I'll stop in with a question and the phones are non-stop ringing, but they still make you feel like a priority no matter what. There is also a new manager now and she is so nice and helpful. She is really good about communicating with you when you have any issues. I also appreciate the massive amount of parking here and honestly the location is perfect for my lifestyle. I have lived here for almost 4 years now, and I honestly couldn't imagine living anywhere else.</Review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>Absolutely love it here! My boyfriend and I moved into a 1 bedroom apartment with our Husky about 7 months ago. The unit is a perfect size and our bedroom is HUGE! All of my neighbors are extremely nice and welcoming. I love that this place is such an animal community! The location is prime. There are restaurants, Sierra Vista Mall, grocery stores etc within a 3 minute drive. There’s also a popular dog park 5 minutes down the road! I’ve met so many awesome people and their animals there. All of the amenities are squeaky clean and super nice! I use the tanning bed and gym pretty frequently. The staff is more than helpful with any of our concerns. The maintenance team is very prompt about fulfilling any maintenance requests. I’m actually very baffled to read negative reviews about Copper Beech and their staff... I couldn’t be more satisfied!<//Text>< resp>

my boyfriend live in this place for about 9 months. the majority of the time he was there he didn’t have any problems until he was being harassed by his roommate. he no longer felt safe being home and only had 3 months left in his lease. he reached out to the office and the lady he spoke to was super unprofessional and didn’t care about his problems at all. she said since nothing had physically happened yet there was nothing they could do and hung up on him. the apartments are very cheap and run down. maintenance doesn’t know why they are doing and hardly do their jobs right. DO NOT LIVE HERE! it will cause you more problems that it’s worth. please look elsewhere.< /review>

Living at Copper Beech has been the best choice that I have made for myself. I absolutely love how big my room is and especially the convenience of the bathroom in my room. The kitchen is so spacious its large enough to fit myself and my 3 other roommates in their while cooking. The staff is super nice and the events that they throw on are super fun!< /review>

Excellent staff that works really hard to make living at Copper Beech one of the best experiences you can have. I have experienced a number of different student living complexes (Bulldog Village, University Village mostly), but Copper Beech truly offers the best amenities and works the hardest to provide a safe and amazing living environment. In my experience, the majority of young people who first move out expect way too much from their property managers to the point where it's infeasible and irrational. You can not expect a staff member to drop everything they are doing and wait on you hand and foot at a moment's notice when there are hundreds of other residents with potentially more pressing concerns. The staff at Copper Beech will do their best to meet your needs and provide wonderful customer service in the process.<//text>

This is a wonderful place for students!! The area is very safe. The complex has security fencing with coded entry. They also have security. The apartments are very roomy. My daughter rents a two bedroom apartment. The living areas are quite large. The bedrooms are upstairs and each one has its own private bathroom. There is a half-bath downstairs. The laundry room is also downstairs. There is a pantry in the kitchen as well as built-in appliances. There is a lot of storage space upstairs with extra cabinets. The apartments are clean and the complex is well maintained. Management is great and my daughter hasn’t had any issues. I do recommend paying for parking. Parking is limited and open spots are first come, first serve. Street parking isn’t recommended.< /review>

I’ve been living here for about a year , at first I had issues in my apartment but it was quickly resolved. I am currently in a 3 bedroom w/garage and my favorite thing about it is the spacious pantry!
The staff is really nice and the new manager is great as well :) it’s great for your first apartment in college!</Text>

<Text>Maintenance is awful here at times. They are always inside our house at least twice a month doing God knows what. At least twice a year, they do "quarterly inspections" where they look throughout your entire home, take photos of your personal belongings, search through your cabinets and night stand drawers, touch your personal belongings searching for anything they can find, and removing bed sheets DURING COVID. I've never heard of an apartment complex taking photos of people's belongings.

The office staff are also not COVID cautious with multiple Tik Toks and instagram posts of the staff together with no masks. When I pass by the office and look inside the windows, I often see the staff with no masks. Melanie, the property manager, doesn't even pretend to wear a mask and walks around the office with residents present without a mask and up close. This makes me uncomfortable to even go inside the office since I am immune compromised and they have a lack of care about COVID precautions.< /Text>< response>

This is my third year living at Copper Beech. I genuinely enjoy it here! I like that the townhome feels like an actual home, and there is so much space to decorate and make it your own. The washer and dryer in the apartment saves you so much money, and I love that I can have my cat here with me.< /Text>

< Review>
I took over a lease at Copper Beech and lived in the apartment for 2.5 months and paid a total of $1,500 in rent. During my time there, I was rarely in the apartment, never wore shoes inside, never had any guests, and kept things clean and tidy. Upon moving out, I spent about 5-6 hours cleaning and left the place in pristine condition. Copper Beech then charged me $264.66 for general cleaning, carpet cleaning, and painting! Do the math and $264.66 divided by $1,500 comes out to paying 17.6% more than I agreed to pay in rent.

When I tried to voice this concern in person, I was told that the property manager Melanie doesn't take appointments. I sent an email and got a response 14 days later (even though it said in writing that it would take no more than 3 days) saying these charges were just "part of the process [...] of getting the unit ready for the next resident".

Does this sound fair to you?

I have rented in four other places before this and never had any issues. Fresno is a large town and I recommend looking on craigslist or roomies.com for other options that are cheaper and have a sense of honesty. This is my first Google review because I get peeved when individuals are grotesquely unfair.< /Review>

HARD PASS
I only lived in this complex for a very short time, long story short; my lease was going to be ending and my new lease didn’t start for 2 more months so I took over a lease at in a three bedroom (less than 3 month).

The condition of the apartment and room I moved into wasn’t anywhere near “good condition” but since I was only going to be there for a short amount of time I didn’t mind much as I wasn’t there a lot at all. Upon moving out my entire deposit was taken plus added fees on top for other things that were already damaged or run down from the previous tenants. The lease I took over only had 3 months remaining, so basically I was charged for all the damage and wear and tear that occurred in the last 9 months that was caused by someone else. They did an inspection before I moved in but the previous tenant was not charged for any of their damages, instead I guess I became responsible for them, even though the people in the office told me that I wouldn’t.

I reached out to management to get some understanding about these charges because I barely lived in this unit and my entire deposit was taken like I destroyed it. They aren’t willing to help out the tenants clearly because the excuse I got was that I “never turned in a “inventory and condition” form after I received my keys” which I 100% DID fill out this form and was so worried about being charged for things that I wasn’t responsible that I even called the office to make sure they got it and the lady on the phone assured me she received it and that she would add it to my file, but guess she never did (:

On top of that, they say it’s a “gated” community but the gate is left open pretty much all day, allowing random people to wander in and out of the complex, dumpsters and looking into cars all through the day, and when the gate IS closed, good luck getting it to actually work.

And we can’t forget about the roaches! I’ve never seen so many roaches in an apartment complex (not just in my unit or building, several of my friends also had this problem here) upon moving in the previous tenant warned me about the bug issue and had called for pest control. I had multiple letters from pest control on the counter when I moved in saying they came to spray but every time I was in the apartment I would see one or multiple.

I’ve lived in multiple different apartment complex and never had an issue with a deposit before, I’ve always gotten it back, I understand general cleaning fees but
the entire deposit? Guess it just hard for me to understand these charged because I was rarely at the apartment and the damages were there when I moved in, I even scrubbed the carpet in my room upon moving in because their were stains left by the previous tenant.

The rooms are big, but that’s about the only positive thing this place has got going for it. Furniture, carpet and everything else is dirty and cheap. I’ve heard awful things for years and I finally got to experience it myself.

Read the reviews on this page and take the advice for others with similar issues. You’ll have a much better living experience elsewhere.

EDIT: They reply to reviews on here and act like they want to help you but they aren’t helpful in person, email or over the phone when directly working with tenants to resolve any problems LMAO.
She literally replied to this review saying “as we discussed today” (never spoken to her today so that’s a straight up lie LMAO) and then she I’m being charged only for cleaning and paint but when I reached out about my deposit WEEKS AGO there’s was only one email interaction of her saying there’s nothing she can do for me or the charges against me since I never turned in my move in inspection form WHICH I DID. Sooo don’t be fooled by their fake sympathy replies it’s just for show ;)<//Review>

I love the privacy you get by having your own bathroom, plus the rooms are spacious. The staff is also active in doing fun raffles, winning prizes, and accumulating points to win a gift card thru your phone.

I’ve had a good experience with maintenance helping out so far. When I call for a repair, they come within a few days. The only time theyd come late (rare) is because they’re busy doing other repairs in other units.

I’ve also seen bug infestation reviews going on here before, but I personally have never dealt with it. It could be if your roommate doesn’t take care of the apartment that leads to bugs. I’ve asked friends who are current/previous residents about bugs, but they never experienced it.

When there was in person classes, theyd have a shuttle that takes u to the school and back. Even the shuttle drivers are nice!

Overall, I do feel Copper Beech has been doing a good job. If u need help, they respond and help the best they can< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I lived here through college for two years and upon moving out they tried to charge me over $800 in additional “cleaning” and move out expenses on top of our deposit! We were extremely clean and I’ve lived in a number of rentals so know exactly what to do upon move out. My father was also a landlord for 25 years and saw the apartment upon us moving out. Melissa was the property manager at the time and she was never helpful and super rude to us. They will try and get money out of you any way they can.</review>

Warning tho they will tow anyone’s car at your own expense, even if you are in your assigned spot. Your parking pass has to be visible at all times, so if you want to lend your spot to a friend make sure they have your permit in their car.< /Review>< pictures>

cool place, make sure you take pictures of your apartments conditions when you first move in. they will try to over charge you for damages that were already there. my roommates and I had to pay like 2,000 thousand dollars when we moved out to remodel the apartment.</review>

I've lived here for two years and it has been great as a college student! The landscaping is always nice, there is security at night and I never hear my neighbors. For the most part, parking is rather easy which is not the case for many complexes here in Fresno.</text>

I've only been living here for about a month and I have had no problems yet. The staff is great when I have any questions and I love the community. My townhouse was in great condition when I moved in, the neighbors are awesome, and I love how there is a shuttle that takes us to Fresno state as well as how there is just so much do around the complex such the pool or the basketball court.</review>

<Review>It is September & I moved out at the end of June. I have not received my security deposit yet, law says it should be returned after 30 days! They keep sugar coating saying they will send it by mail any day now! This happened to all 4 of my roommates! They also charged for paint cleaning which is illegal to do! When you're moving in they want everything paid and ready to go the day you move in but when you are ready to move out they take their sweet time on you.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

This place is so unprofessional. They say it's first come first serve for room availability. But that was not the case for me. I was told to fill out the application to process that I did that. And never received a call from them so I called in and I spoke with a guy who told me he would call back and tell me if they had availablity. He never called back so I had to call back the day after and I spoke with a lady who told me that earlier that day someone had signed for the last room available. When I had already gone through the process I was just waiting on them. On top of that when I went on a tour the guy was all weird with us. And I legit felt like they prioritized people they knew and the overall experience with them was not pleasant. They didn't make me feel welcome and willing to work with me. I don't recommend this place at all, once again they were very unprofessional.<//Review>

Probably the most unprofessional place I’ve honestly ever been to. Very unorganized and horrible service. I highly suggest not living here to save yourself money, and patience. The office and managers are rated at a novice level in my opinion and I have 0 respect for this organization. Save your money and do not live here</Text>

Absolute nightmare.  You've been warned.  Management is nasty, roaches everywhere, paper thin walls (very noisy and they dont care), ugly furniture, horrible cardboard feeling mattress (the couch is better to sleep on).  Ruby is the new manager and she doesn't care to help fix anything.  They will treat you like a child here, random inspections to check for "cleanliness".  What is this the military barracks.  These are not dorms!!!  There are families and working adults here.  They look decent on the outside but trust me, nothing fancy inside at all.<//Text>

The reviews on this site are negative, but let me give you some other perspective on what they wrote.  The apartment that was open for tours was mine.  The management paid us to show our apartment on the condition that we kept it clean.  I ended up in the hospital, and we had a difficult time on a couple of occasions.  The management would always announce coming tours.  They never showed up unannounced (even if we were not home). Management does not show random apartments.

As for the roaches, I admit that there were roaches in the garage, but they were always dead. I mostly see them by the garbage, but I haven't seen any since seeing a new exterminator.

My family moved into Copper Beech last August of 2012 and we couldn't be happier. We love the spaciousness of the townhome and with 3 boys and a family of 5 we feel like we have plenty of space. Anytime we have had a concern or maintenance issue it has been addressed quickly and efficiently. The staff treats us with respect and is extremely professional. We enjoy all of the special events and contests they hold here. There are always opportunities to receive special perks and prizes. They go out of there way to show there appreciation for their tenants. Even though our lease isn't up until August we had NO hesitation in deciding to stay another year. We are looking forward to the pool opening soon which was ALWAYS clean and inviting. Our decision to move here has made all 5 of us happy and we feel like we have a wonderful "home" not just an apartment to live in.</text>

The management here is a big mess. I have endless stories about how it sucks living here. One of the biggest things I hate about them is that they will turn off the water and let you know an hour before they do so. They say it'll only be off for an hr but 100% of the time this is a lie. It either takes the whole day or more than one day. And if you try to call them to see if they're going to do anything about they just say you have to figure it out. This is when I got mad and I told them they had to figure it out if not I'll be calling back and I won't be as nice on the phone and an hour later they bought everyone waters. But they only bought us water that one time.<//Text>

< Review>
Wow...excellent customer service from Nick at the front desk/order pickup counter.   We had travelled from Temecula for some Starbucks Nespresso pods as all other Targets were out of stock.  When we got there, our online order had not been fulfilled yet.   That did not stop Nick...he tracked our product down as it was out of stock on the shelf.   Phenomenal customer service by Nick and a great representation of your Target brand.  It is not common this days to get this level of great service!!!< /Review>

<Review>I absolutely love the men's area from the beard care to the cremo body wash and the mens under garment is awsome. And any kitchen utensils from pots and pans to your daily coffee cup there is a big variety that will tackle any dinner situation. Also purchased my bedding and its so comfy and durable I love the turn out, and this is for any target I go shopping to!🤙🏻</Review>< Pics>

Experience was terrible. Well it was pretty good until I got up to checkout at register 5. While I was trying to explain to the cashier that the machine literally could not hold my card, she blatantly ignored me and played on her Apple Watch instead. I’m a department manager at a retail store in Texas so I understand the annoyance you can feel through the day but I would NEVER treat someone like that. I guess hospitality is just something you experience in any state but California.<//text>

<review>I personally love this target as the Atmosphere the employees have with each other is very uplifting and settling in these hard times. I was personally helped by a cashier named Natalie and she was very sweet and helped me with all my items. She was a real ray of sunshine in the dark times of corona and was very polite( since speaking and articulating words is harder with masks) in trying to understand what I was saying. I wish all target’s employees could take a note from Nat.</review><user>116449908210743364251</user>< Time>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>Okay, this usually does not happen in Target very surprised. Well, I stoped here last week after leaving  Ross (which is almost next door). When I arrived I went to the ladles room first, and OMG this was the most dirtiest restroom ever. I'm not going to describe what I saw, but it was not what I would expect from Target. Maybe a gas station, but not Target. In fact there are gas stations that looked better than this was looking. I was very surprised cause Target holds themselves to a higher standard than that. With all that is going on this was scary. Lastly, I'm sure this may have been a bad day, and I hope this will not be often.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<rating>2</rating><text>The customer service at this store is really bad. First of all none of them can hear/understand what your questions are. None of them knew the product information : The easy answer was we don’t carry that product. I had to go on line and get the isle number so that they could locate the item. FYI it was Keebler Pie Crust. I’m truly surprised because Target has good standards.<//text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80dcb8f0438d1595:0x9f4d2a5b4d59d052</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Very rude employee in electronics. She has short hair, found out her name was Lauren, and she should watch how she speaks to customers. I can’t see how such a mean person can be working there<//Text>

Every department is lacking in inventory, and what little inventory they do have is scattered randomly across the sections in which they belong.

The workers actively avoid eye contact, and seem to be some of the most apathetic individuals you could ever hire. Many of them look lost, rather than performing an actual duty. I could, perhaps, ignore all this if the cashiers weren't slower than molasses.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80dcb8f0438d1595:0x9f4d2a5b4d59d052< /GmapID></record>

I love target but this target in particular seems to frequently be out of products, baby and produce specifically; or poorly cleaned, the bathrooms and shoe department in particular. I love the company, the products and what they offer but I wish that my local store took more pride than it seems they currently do.< /Text>

I love the clothes, quality clothes in plus sizes. Most places you go are fashionable with poor quality or high prices ,high quality, but end up looking like a giant toddler. Target makes me feel beautiful and sexy with quality clothing at affordable prices.<//Text>

<Text>Went looking for a particular item. Asked for help in the toy department was directed to correct isle.    Went to marked down area of girl clothing, worker scanned an item to check price for me she was polite and apologetic for full priced item placed in discounted area.  self Check out was fast and efficient worker was polite and offered to help.  Went to food shop, worker was very nice and checked out quickly.  Over all a clean well run store. Very satisfied😊< /Text>< pics>

Every time I go, I want to use the self checkout.  I have my RedCard loaded into my wallet in my app on my phone.  I use it...it sometimes works right but about half the time it doesn't and they send me over customer service to wait in line with a printed receipt with a bar code on it and they sometimes they give me cash to cover my 5% redcard discount.  Silly.  What's the purpose?  I am slowly and deliberately tapering my Target shopping off to other retailers.</review>

<text>Having all of my Christmas shopping done on-line and ready for my husband to simply pick up at the store was fantastic! If I had sent my husband to the store to find these items it would have been a disaster. Getting things shipped to the house is risky because of people stealing packages off the porch. This was an excellent way to get everything we needed with the least amount of stress possible.< /text>< response>

<text>The grocery department looks like the Miami store just before a hurricane.  A friend thought they were clearing out to close. This isn’t some recent experience. It’s shabby all the time. I was informed by an employee they get a truck daily, but don’t have enough people to keep merchandise shelved. Every other department is generally acceptable. If you want to SELL IT YOU HAVE TO SHOW IT ! Come on y’all act like you care.</text>< user_id>

This Target is my family's go-to store being that we live in the Dos Lagos community. The guest service is always great and I particularly love that the shelves always look neat, things are easy to find and they take pride in the aesthetics of the store. Line/queue management for checkout is the main focus of opportunity. Many times where they will open a new line but not manage the existing queues into the new line to reduce stacking. It's not horrible, but it needs work.<//text>

This is a pretty clean Target. I just wish they had a bigger selection on woman's clothing. Great service though. Also a Starbucks inside.</Text>

I always come here for the green tea
I'm always happy with the costumer service. There's a new girl named Darlene.  While I was ordering my tea she was talking to the other co-worker and when she decided she was done with her conversation she took my order. I was like, what? She was distracted talking to the girl while making my tea it seemed like my tea tasted more like water than green tea. Another woman asked her for napkins and she rolled her eyes, what the hell happened here. I really enjoyed coming here but I think I'll start going to the one by the theaters.  I sat down to observe her and she payed no attention to any of Starbucks costumers.  She just ran her mouth the whole time.< /Text>

This store NEVER has stock. I have been to this target a few times at different times of the day and the shelves are EMPTY. It is very dissapointing and and annoying. Might as well go to the Walmart up the street.< /review>

Clean store, limited selection. Jose needs to learn crowd control before commanding the line to check out. Shoved us off into self check out (two with no hand scanner), pulled out of line behind us, who checked out quite a while before us. Never asked us.   Not cool.< /review>

<review>BEWARE of giftcard purchases!!!  Purchased a Verizon Prepaid Service card which is actually useless to me because I am not a prepaid customer. Although there is money on the card, Target refuses to refund the money as the receipt has expired...Receipt expired??? How can a receipt expire? Who benefits from this money??? Store Manager Nikki McAndrew was unable to answer the question< /review>< Pictures>

It's a good overall store with plenty of parking in a nice shopping center. But sometimes the shelves are a disaster, and it seems like they don't really care about updating the seasonal section often with correct prices, etc.</Text>

< Review>
Usually patients leave reviews, but I had such a wonderful experience over the phone with the pharmacist today that I felt obligated to write a review.  I spoke with the pharmacist (Ms. Lee).  To make a long story short.  She was amazing.  She did not rush me.  listened to what I needed for my patient and helped my patient that was in excruciating pain a kind and professional manner.  Thank you Ms. Lee rph.  and thank you Target for hiring someone so professional and kind.</Review>

I never really complain on a forum but when I got here they had no cash registers open and when i tried to pay the self check out began to blinck red and it took 15 minutes before anyone came to help me. Employees would watch as the light blinked in that fifteen minutes just pointing and stareing. (When I say no regiester was open i mean no one was at a register not that there was a long line.)< /Review>

< Review>
This review is for the phone section, the dude was no help whatsoever. Biggest waste of time ever, I went to him with an approval code that I got from Verizon and tells me I need to make the account first and he doesn't want to run my credit thru target again. So I make the account at the Verizon store nearby, come back and should have no problems now, he then takes like 15 mins just to 'pull up the account' supposedly and now I tell him the phone I want, and he disappears for another literal 15-20 mins just to find the phone. THEN he needs to RUN A CREDIT CHECK to buy the phone???? I've never heard of that in my life, all you have to do is add the line with the phone on my ALREADY APPROVED account?!! DUDE is an absolute joke, talking to him was like no one was home he doesn't even answer the question that I'm asking him just, "the system is not letting me". "I don't know what to tell you". "Try the norco target or go to verizon". What kind of customer service is that??? I know the dude is a liar because I asked him to show me the errors and all he did was click click click and not show me anything. FIRE HIM. He's there for absolute nothing and I'm gonna be back there and the manager better help me. Absolute no excuse for his dumb behavior he had no idea what he was doing. See you tomorrow!!<//Review>

<text>Horrible employees there especially the manager say that I can't put my dog in the target shopping cart which I think is pretty messed but I like the other target better in Anaheim because they let you  put your dogs in a cart  this target won't even let a handicap dog stay in the cart  which is pretty stupid and pretty dumb of them so if you ever consider bringing your dog I suggest you go to the one in Anaheim because they are much friendlier this target just sucks and they are rude<//text></record>

I have tested here for the COVID Rapid antigen now 3x in the past month for work (I am a nurse). Results are never sent within 15 minutes as advertised. I have had to call every time I have been tested to have them send me results an hour, sometimes 2 hrs after because the phone line is either busy or there's "dropped calls". Most recently, I was tested for rapid antigen yesterday and when I finally received my results, they were from my test on 07/22! Seems like a very convenient drive-in testing center but unfortunately, I will not be recommending this place to anyone in healthcare field or others in need of reliable testing.< /Text>

Cheap but staff didn’t wear proper protective gear, weren’t very organized and haphazardly ran the whole operation. At one point one of the staff members even took off their mask to get the others attention.< /Text>

The accuracy of these tests are low, yet the pricing of these tests are high. Unfortunately, the turnaround time for results is more than 15 minutes (over 2 hours). Lastly, the staff does not take the best precautions to play it safe either -some had a thin masks or cloth masks.. no gloves, no protective clothes (regular clothes no hazmat suits), and they even asked us to cough on them 3x.. with them only wearing masks.. did not feel like the most legit place to go for a test.
My family and I went here when we suspected possible covid. Out of 6 members only one tested positive per on point throat swab test.  Before getting my results I drove by a PCR testing site  (which takes 2 days for results but its free and MUCH more accurate). We decided to get PCR tests to double check. There -people were masked, kept a distance, wore protective suits over their clothes, did not want to come anywhere near us.. felt like they were taking all necessary steps. Anyway 2 days later we got our results and 3 out of 6 members were positive for COVID. Both tests were taken within less than an hour, but PCR took longer. If you must take a 15 min, do it ! But to be sure go to a free county PCR test site.< /text>

I had a 9:30 a.m. appointment and got there 10 minutes early. The line of cars were down the street and wrapped around the block. I wasn’t seen until almost 1 pm! An over 3 hour wait and I still had to pay $49 for “rapid” testing. It’s been 2 hours and still no results. There was only one van that tests were being done out of and 1 woman operating it. She did her best but they need more resources and help if they’re going to advertise RAPID results and appointment times. The positive is that it was easy to book a same-day appt. However I wouldn’t risk their waiting times if you are traveling etc. and in a rush! If I do not receive my result by their closing time, I intend to ask for a refund.< /review>

Very poor and unprofessional customer service. Will not use them again.
I also find it dishonest to see a 5 Star review posted here by a “Paul  Rogers”, who is the same rude and belligerent manager I had to deal with on the phone. I wonder how many more of these reviews  are fake….< /review>

This is a scam . They are charging people $60 for a “rapid” test, and they’re super unprofessional!! Please don’t come here and waste your money on this fake test. They don’t even test it in an ACTUAL lab, it’s inside their van.. they always ask to confirm my name after they take a sample as if they don’t know where it’s going.. they can’t even provide their staff with the correct PPE. Please don’t trust this “company” and go else where.</Text>

<review>Not recommended at all for before flights tests. No results within 15 minutes. Once test done, you receive a message written until 48 hours for the results.
More, Appointment scheduled non respected (1 hour delay). I spend money for nothing. I had to perform another rapid test at the airport: a real 15 minutes test for 240$.<//review>< Pictures>

<username>Nadya Kondrashov< /username><date>1625519906485< /date><review>I scheduled an appointment online for rapid covid testing before my flight. When I got there, there was a van with the company name in some parking lot and no one was there. There were 2 other people who came for their appointments.
I scheduled my test specifically at this time because I had a flight to Europe that night,  and needed a rapid test done within 48 hours before my flight.
Because of their poor service, I had an anxiety attack and had to call tons of numbers to find a rapid test within close distance so I could make it to my flight.
Terrible.< /review></record>

If you need to take a PCR for a flight don’t take it here. It won’t come at the right time even if in the web says that it will come in 24 hours. Took it on Thursday, the woman over there said it should be ready on Saturday before 10:00AM but couldn’t assure it. Have to take my flight at 1PM so I think I would have enough time.

So I called on Saturday morning. The man over the phone told me is going to be ready around 6PM. He told me that the 24 hour result will come only if i took the test before 3pm (the reservation website never said that). He can give me a refund only at that time. I said to him that I need 20 minutes to talk with my airline. I have to cancel 3 flights. I called him 20 minutes and he told me he can’t cancel it now. It was a take it or leave it on the last phone call. I consider some comments he told me very unprofessional.

My test result is not even valid for my next flight so I wasted $150.</Review>

The drive up test here has 2 lanes which is convenient since it’s right on El Camino. Every staff member I interacted with was kind, helpful & professional. The sign up process was easy & quick, and so was the test (mouth swab). I received my rapid results within the hour. I’ll be going back anytime I need a quick test!</Review>

C’est de l’arnaque -  on attendu plus d ‘une heure pour faire le test alors qu’on avait pris rendez vous , une fois qu’on a payé ils nous ont annoncé que le délai était de 45 minutes - alors que l’on a payé pour un test rapid de 15min - et 3 heures après , on reçoit un mail pour nous dire que nous aurons les résultats dans 48 heures  - n’y aller surtout pas .</text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Been training here for only 3 or so months right now and let me tell you it is the real deal. Coach Al and the team here has really helped me significantly improve my fitness, conditioning, boxing skills, and most importantly my mental fortitude. Personally, it was a bit difficult for me to find a boxing gym that is REALLY trying to teach you to box since nowadays there are so many boxing for only fitness gyms. Whether your goal is to compete at the highest levels, learn how to defend yourself, or just get in the best shape of your life Coach Al and the team at Warzone Boxing Club will all help you reach your goals. Take it from someone who has bounced around gym after gym and has a hard time trusting a coach.<//Text>< pics>

I got to say I've been to a bunch of boxing clubs and hands down Warzone is the best there is. The coaches are super friendly and know what they are doing. The training is worth going through I feel stronger and faster than ever really boosted my confidence. I recommend going. Team Warzone</Text>

Came in for a free trial and loved this place immediately. Coach Al is extremely knowledgeable and his entire crew is welcoming. I have been in boxing since the time i was able to spell the word and have worked with many coaches throughout my military boxing career into my amateur boxing career. All I can say is that I wish I would have found coach al when I was young. I may have gone further maybe even professionally. I recommend this place to anyone whose looking for a real experienced training facility. Military and law enforcement friendly as well.</Text>

Hands down one of the best boxing gyms I have ever been a part of. I first started boxing at the Warzone back in 2003 when the gym was located in Riverside, California off of Sampson and Buchanan. The atmosphere then was the same as it is now, hard work, good coaches, and a great owner. Coach Al taught me about nutrition, how to take care of my body, how to fight and compete in the ring and most importantly how to be successful in life outside of the ring. I have nothing but positive things to say about the Warzone Boxing Club and would recommend this gym to anyone novice, beginner, intermediate, advanced, and professional.<//review>

Went in recently and was greeted by a coach threatening one of the students and being rude. Smells like cow urine in the place and does not look clean. I saw no one on one boxing accept with the ones who are good. looks like the coach just cares about his money and just keeps his business moving, only picking the good ones to coach. Super overcrowded classes and don't recommend</Review>

<response>{'time': 1583293500454, 'text': 'We are sorry for your “experience” how ever if true it would break all policies we have had in place for almost 20 years. We never use foul language in our facility with the exception of the adult classes and even then its more at a conversation level not belittling or yelling at anyone. If we do have issues with kids, we always call the parents, we never confront the kids and we surely do not threaten them. We will yell at them saying things like “LETS WORK” KEEP PUSHIN” things of that nature but again not belittling anyone.\n\nOur expectation of our members is for them to work hard and we will never accept those who disrupt the flow of classes. We will cancel those who are not interested in working hard so that they do not spread their cancerous habits to others. All students are treated equally, and no one is given more time over any other person unless they are actually doing personal sessions.\n\nNow, recently we had a group of 8 or so teenaged students that were more interested in hanging around outside then actually training. So, we let those students go. We canceled all of their future payments and terminated their contracts without any fees. Contact was first made with a parent to notify them of our intentions and all were very understanding and appreciative of our honesty and willingness to cancel their memberships and not just take their money.\n\nNow we have checked into your two reviews and traced them back to being the same person. Unfortunately you were one of the students that was cut from our program and this review isn’t fair or honest, we feel it was done out of spite but we hope that you find the right place that fits your needs and we will continue to hold our standards high.'}</response><GmapID>0x80c331c96b92def3:0x7372a42c034f3831< /GmapID></record>

I have had Parkinson’s for 3 yrs and my doctor told me the number one therapy is Boxing I couldn’t believe it! Am I going to start boxing at my age ? I guess your never to old to try and at 66 years old Ifound WarZoneBoxingClub through my friend ,Glen
Who also has Parkinson’s. I saw such an improvement in Glen I had to give it a try !
Owner ,Trainer ,Coach , Al Franco my new friend is a master at working with you and getting your best effort! Which brings tremendous results ! Just ask my wife she saw a difference the first visit !
This facility is great , every thing you need to become a boxer and train into a new YOU! With Coach Al’s experience he will have you sparing in no time and work outs that are rigorous beyond your expectations!
It is no wonder the Best Coaches attract the Best people wanting a physical and boxing instructed workout .It is motivating to have great people helping and encouraging you along the way! There is no other place like Warzone because that’s the only place you can meet Coach Al ! I love this place and could not be happier !  I Recommend this Club to anyone wanting a great life.

This is by far the best boxing gym I've ever went to. Coach Al and Coach Daniel put their soul in making you learn how to do boxing. It starts with fundamentals; it takes a while but with this gym you'll be one of the best. Also there is eveything you need at the gym and they offer boxing gear like head gear, gloves, wraps and mouthpiecez for less than the price of the official website of the product. Just try the free one class they offer and see how well it is!< /review>

<Review>Warzone boxing gym is a great place. All the trainers are super knowledgable and friendly. Everyone training there that I've met has also been friendly and very welcoming. This is a great place to train, stop by without hesitation, don't be intimidated if you're new or are a beginner, everyone in here is super helpful and friendly. If you have goals you want to achieve warzone will get you there.

I've been going to the men's night class. But right before that class there's a teen's class and that class seems like a great atmosphere. Kids all smiling and getting a great workout in at the same time. I can't remember the last time I've seen that many kids OFF THEIR PHONES FOR THAT LONG! It's kind of close to a miracle.

There needs to be a warzone boxing gym in every city. And a coach Al in every one of those. The world would definitely be a better place. I believe that. I truly do.< /Review>< GmapID>

<rating>5<//rating><text>WARZONE Boxing is above and beyond! I did my research and looked around. Coach Al (Owner) took the time to talk and explain everything to me. He wasn’t about the money, he was on the other hand all about my sons development and the love for the sport! This is a professional boxing facility, not a YMCA or community center. No spin or Zumba here! The facility is extremely clean and well maintained. My 10 year old loves it at Warzone. He started 2 months ago and can’t wait for training and sparring days!!

<Review>This gym is dope. I was looking for a gym with knowledgeable coaches who could properly coach me and I found Warzone. Coach Al and his coaches are just what I was looking for. They are perfect for any level fighter, beginner or experienced. The gym in Upland is one of the best boxing gyms I’ve been to, it’s clean, the equipment is new, set up is nice and the ring looks amazing. The Warzone boxing gym is the best in the I.E. hand down.</Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I am new to boxing and well working out at 29. I had planned on going to the Warzone in Rancho but by the time I had the chance to do so they moved. So once they opened up in Upland I jumped in. I’m so glad I did, I love this place and I only regret not doing it sooner. Rialto was to far for me but upland is just a mile away. Place looks great and the personal training is the way to go for me. Once I get in better shape I will jump into the classes.< /Review>< Rate>

Warzone Boxing is an absolute
invaluable training facility that will enhance your drive to attain, and maintain a sound mind, and body. It is more than just a gym. It’s a source of hope. I say it’s a source of hope, because that is what I was given since the first day I began training there. As a Marine Combat Veteran who is now retired, I lost hope for well over a year. I longed for the camaraderie, and passion I experienced while serving in the Marine Corps. I was sure I would never find it again. Well, I did find that camaraderie, and passion I so longed for. I found it at a place
called Warzone Boxing in Upland California. Coach Al, and his staff are genuine professionals. The caliber of their knowledgeable, and professionalism is unmatched. Throughout my career in the Marines, I’ve met good men like this before. Men like Coach Al, and his staffs immense positive energy, and attention to detail is contagious. They will sharpen you, and you will become an enhanced version of yourself. Make no mistake, steel is forged in fire. Do not be discouraged though. Coach Al, and his staff will walk through the fire with you, and make you the sharpest piece of steel that can adapt to any darkness you will encounter on this journey we are all on. Lastly, due to past traumas in my life, I used to be afraid to leave my apartment, or even go to the grocery store. I can say now with confidence, I’m not afraid anymore, and going outside has never been so beautiful.

Thank you Coach Al.

Semper Fidelis,
-A thankful Marine< /text>

Raul was so pleasant to work with. I was running late and missed my appointment, but he was able to reschedule me for later in the day. I also forgot my DMV paperwork, but he was super patient with me while I scrounged around in my glove compartment to find my old registration. I was able to use a coupon from the website for $20 off, and I was in and out in 15 minutes. Very satisfied, I'll definitely come back for future smog tests.</review>

If you need a smog test this is the place to go. I had a 2 appointment and he was right on time!! He gave me a discount that really helped.  Place is a little hard to find but not impossible and his waiting room should be avoided as it is very dirty. As far as his work is it was spot on!!</review>

<Text>Hard to really rate a smog check service. Every time I take my car in, they give it a passing report. Is that good? Or is that bad? I'll assume that the car is actually not polluting more than current standards allow and call it "good".
They successfully upload the pass result to the DMV systems so that I can complete the registration the next day, so that's good.
The "waiting area" is kinda iffy. Thankfully they've never made me wait there for too long.
The guy handling intakes was polite and efficient.
All in all, a good enough smog check service, I think.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>Normally this place let's you drop in and get a smog but due to COVID you have to make an appointment.  I didnt know this and the guy was kinda rude about saying, but he had been repeating himself all day I'm sure. But in our defense none of knew and they didnt let their customers know. So be patient!< /review>< pictures>

<Name>White Rice 0<//Name><text>First off, with the coupon I had handy, I got my smog & certificate for $38 even ('04 civic) so that was pretty sweet.

Second, I rolled up at 11:40, no appointment, and was finished before noon.  Absurdly fast (admittedly there wasn't anybody else being serviced at the time, but even so, it was quick)

Third, the tech who took care of my car was quite friendly & polite.  Greeted with a smile, made sure I had all my paperwork in order, & was just all around pleasant.

Even without the coupon the price would have been better than a number of the other shops around, so that was really just an added bonus.

I'll be coming back when I need my next smog check, and have already pointed a few friends this way as well.</text></record>

I just found out about these guys and wished I had known about them sooner! This smog shop has a sibling office down the road that also offers DMV services (for a fee). It is a family run shop that employs competent and courteous technicians and managers. All you have to do is show up with your paperwork and if you need to register or file any other paperwork just go down the street to the registration office and they take good care of you! HIGHLY RECOMMENDABLE!< /review>

One of the best! Very fast, very friendly service, I was in and out of there in less than 20 minutes. If you make an appointment, they knock off $10 for you and if you can upload the coupon, its an extra $20 off. You can't find a better deal than that!< /Text>

I saw no issues before, during, or after the test. The tech further stated that he "doesn't do anything without getting paid" when I asked for a retest. Just a heads up when selecting this place among all the other local shops.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x8084380f9eaffd45:0x1825bb400b032ac7< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Have been bringing our three cars and one truck to Express Smog for years.  I find them to be professional, courteous, and well-priced.  Highly recommend them.</review>

I have been to the Santa Rosa and Petaluma shops and have never had a bad experience! I had an older car and was told over the phone it would be a little more expensive because another test is required- with my Val-pak coupon it was still under $50!

I have had 5 cars tested at 101 smog and bringing #6 tomorrow :)<//text>

< review>
Repeat customer from 2 years ago, had a great experience in 2011 and today. Had originally been referred by a friend. Two young guys working had to make a business successful; price was right and they accommodated my schedule. Was concerned that my truck might not pass since my OBDII scanner couldn't connect to the OBDII port, was told they'd check before they ran the test. If they couldn't connect they wouldn't run the test.

The only knock is they only have 3 chairs in the waiting room (2 additional chairs are broken) but you're also not paying auto dealer prices. Keep up the good work guys and
thanks for your help today.<//review>

<text>Absolutely terrible.  The vehicle passed emissions, but they said the catalytic converter did not have the proper EO # on it.  This vehicle has passed at other Star stations.  They also would not accept a company check.  Quite sure I was ripped off.  Never going there again<//text>< Pics>

{'time': 1462304660361, 'text': "Just for the record. In the great state of California, all vehicles that are subject to undergo a smog test and that have non-standard parts fitted (that are part of the emission system) require an Executive Order (EO) number to be visible on the part at the time of test. Sadly, your vehicle had no such part number. This was clearly explained to you at the time.\nWe do not make the rules, we are obliged to carry them out however unpopular or inconvenient you may find this. If we are subject to a bar inspection and are remiss in our duties, we get a big citation and fine.\n\nIf you believe we are in error, you should contact the BAR Referee and put your case before them.\n\nVisit www.asktheref.org or call (800) 622-7733 to learn more details about the BAR Referee Program, find a Referee station, or to schedule an appointment.\n\nRegarding our company policy of NO CHECKS, every clipboard where you sign the work orders front and back have a notice in red. The distance from the signature box to this NO CHECKS is approximately one inch. There is also a NO CHECKS sign again in red stuck to the window some six inches from where you attempted to pay by check.\n\nThrowing your card at my technician will not carry favor, neither will the verbal tirade directed at him. In actual fact the father of your company's president was kind enough to apologize for your unreasonable behavior.\n\nThe final question that springs to mind, was that if your vehicle passed at other smog stations, why dig you come to ours?"}< /response>

I went there this morning. I did not make an appointment as the website said; walk ins welcome. I  was treated like I was stupid, and made to wait outside (until a guy let me inside who was not affiliated with 101). It was fast, but the two shop guys attitudes were terse and condescending< /Text>

You are correct, walk-ins are very welcome however an appointment will usually be more expeditious when we are busy.\n\nI apologize most sincerely and unreservedly that you were asked to wait outside. The mitigating circumstances are that on Mondays & Thursdays our machines are required to be calibrated, however I realize that this did not apply to the machine used for your vehicle.\n\nI have spoken to my staff on the subject on the brusque manner with which you were allegedly treated and this issue has been addressed. Once again on behalf of us all please accept our apologies.\n\nAll the very best, Adrian...'}< /resp>

{'time': 1497490526929, 'text': 'Just for clarification purposes, you made an appointment for your 19 year old son at 1:00pm to bring the 1999 Honda Accord in, and were quoted a discounted price by our technician at the time the appointment was made.\n\nYour son arrived at approximately 10:45am, he did not mention the booking or the discounted price and was happy to pay the published wall price. This fact was confirmed to our technician on the telephone when you phoned up to fire a tirade of abuse at him. When you asked your son, if he indeed had notified us of either the booking, or the discount, he quite clearly said and I quote "NO!" At this point, you then chose to entertain our technician with your obscene language directed at your son, and then redirected it at our technician.\n\nAfter you finished abusing my staff through what must either be your own incompetence, I am stunned that you have the temerity to go on a public forum and vent.\n\nIt is painfully obvious by the your son\'s admission that he didn\'t notify us that, and that we are neither mind readers or psychics. Had you had approached the situation in a more contrite manner, I would have probably refunded the difference. Seeing as you could not contain your passion, I am inclined to not refund the difference and maybe in the future, you might communicate to your grown man of a son that he should come at the appointed time, identify himself that an appointment was made and that you had a discounted price quoted. This would prevent ridiculous exchanges on here.'}< /Response>

Called around and found that they were the cheapest place with an appointment price of $40.  I made an appointment for noon, showed up on time and only spent about 20 minutes there total from pull in to pull out. Staff seemed friendly but it's a couple of younger guys running a smog check station not a fine dining restaurant so I don't know what other people who left bad reviews about that were expecting.</Text>

The reason you could not have been dealt with promptly is, we only had one technician working until 10am and he was smog testing one car & busy calibrating one of our testing machines. This test is required twice a week by BAR. Usually we have two technicians and a service writer in attendance.\nWe have no way of screening calls. Once again I apologize for being unable to deal with your call in a timely manner.'}<//response>

< review>
I shop at Carter's quite a bit, but was somewhat surprised at the lack of selection in my child's size. There was a great selection of girls clothing, but felt the boys side was not quite as extensive. But maybe it was just the day I chose to go. Overall, they are very affordable with a very clean store.< /review>

<text>Awesome vegan restaurant that is close to the water - Oceanside pier.  You can order your food inside or call it in.  We happened to go on a Thursday late afternoon before the dinner rush and we had the place to ourselves.

The food is thoughtfully prepared and served with the waiter wearing a mask all of the time. We used the outside dining area which was cozy.  I tried the super veggie burrito and my wife had the YIPPEE-KI-YAY burger with their pretzel bun.  Both items were filling and tasted freshly prepared. It was great to enjoy a completely vegan meal in a kitchen that prepares all plant based meals.

Enjoy eating plants...< /text><user_name>Nasser Salomon< /user_name></record>

Great food at an affordable price! Everything is vegan with most things available with a gluten-free option. They use Beyond meat for burgers and meat balls so no soy! Great experience!</review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>When I think vegan I typically think bland and boring, but I've transformed haha. Eve Oceanside is delicious and delightful and we can't wait to go back and experience more of the delicious(and healthy) menu. Decided to give them a try last night for our anniversary dinner, being that we've been fasting from meat & wheat for a few weeks, this place was like hitting the jackpot🙌. We ordered the Seitan Pepperoni & Olive flatbread, Peppadew Pesto Flatbread and Southern Mystic bowl and were very impressed with the melding of flavors with all our choices. The portion sizes were great and left plenty for lunch the next day. Give them a shot, you won't be disappointed. Keep up the great work guys🤙👏!<//text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80dc6f45b487f8bf:0x99932a0996900521<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

This place is amazing! We ate here 2 out of the 3 days I was in town, it was so good. Delicious vegan food that even an omni will love, big portions, and reasonable prices.  We ordered a flatbread and a burrito which lasted two people three meals.<//Text>

<rating>3</rating><text>The pineapple on my burger was burnt. It's not the tastiest burger I've ever had, in fact I think it needed a bit of salt. But the staff is very kind and the place is cool. It's very homey and it even has books. A perfect place to have a hangout or do your work, like in a cafe. It's the first time I've eaten here and I kinda want to go back to try more menu items, but I'm unsure if it's worth it after tasting my burger. Maybe it's just my personal taste and I'd say give it a go to see if you like it.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dc6f45b487f8bf:0x99932a0996900521< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>
<Review>It's overly priced for the quality of food. Ordered a flatbread and the crust felt like it hadn't even been cooked. It was dry, stodgy and abhorrent to eat. The burger I ordered wasnt good either. Even though its corona virus times, this place has a border made up of their tables and chairs to block people from coming up to the cash register. That's just silly and not necessary.</Review>< resp>

This place kills the vegan game hands down perfect portions with the price to match ty. I got the Beyond Burger Jamaican Me Crazy delicious and then my girlfriend got it's really nice fresh little bowl I forget the name but trust me even the cambuci they served with a rose kombucha delicious it was wonderful for the sunset in Newport it's worth taking the train from anywhere from Fullerton Anaheim orange Santa Ana Tustin Irvine Mission Viejo and Capo on the weekend it's just $10 round trip the nice little date with you being on the coast they call it really the surfliner because the waves are crashing on the rocks of the track<//review>

A must try for anyone. Obviously they have plant based menu but the food is amazing even as a non plant based eater. Give them a try. My only recommendation would be to switch out a few of the kombucha taps for beer!</Text>

Took my veggie mom here for a bday treat (both been locals over 30 yrs) because she didn't know oside had vegan. While she was more annoyed than required because they didn't have pesto (sorry about that) she absolutely LOVED the THREE MEALS (for two people) we ordered. I want that salad dressing- sell it to meeee!!<//text>

Love having this place close by. Usually order one of their burritos, which was amazing when they first opened, but something changed and I haven't enjoyed them the last 2 times we've been. Maybe they loaded mine up with more peppers, cheese, etc the first couple of times because I always leave out the chorizo, but these last 2 burritos tasted mostly of bland beans and rice. I want to keep supporting them so I will have to find something else to eat on the menu.<//Review>

< Review>
Ordered 2 things. Pizza burger and Santa Maria burrito. Pizza burger was all splattered with the pizza sauce and the bottom bun was completely soaked it wasn't appealing to eat. The arugula salad that came with it where some wilted and weren't fresh at all.
The burrito, as huge as it was, was breaking apart when I picked it up to take a bite and the brown rice was dry and wasnt cooked well and thorough...
(Tips: brown rice should be washed and soaked for 30 min before cooking because it soaks alot water it is needed to be soaked first. Example...3 cups of brown rice would need 3 and a half to 4 cups of water....left to soak for 30 min and then turned on to cook)and the whole burrito after falling apart from just one bite collapsed. Please don't cook and serve food like that.</Review>

Great atmosphere, super kid friendly and the sweetest servers! The food was not so great, kind of a hail mary for the beyond burger... everything was stuffed with a beyond beef patty, and everything else is unseasoned and bland.... the kale salad is rough and the leaves need to be massaged for a bit before being served, but the sage vinegarette tasted really good.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>Wow, couldn’t be more disappointed. Ordered from here through DoorDash and was let down big time. Ordered the “la ganja burrito” and two flatbreads which were all gluten free but wasn’t specified on the menu (could be door dash’s fault).
The burrito had uncooked beans, and was missing almost every ingredient listed! There were literally about 4 pieces of potato and inedible pieces of cabbage. That’s it!
The flatbreads are corn based and tasted like dry corn bread. The toppings were good but the crust was so dry it made everything else taste really bland.
Doubt I’ll ever give this place a second chance.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Prefer this restaurant to the one in Encinitas as it's larger, less chaotic and the service was more prompt, however this place has its issues too.  The service is a tad lackluster and the décor is odd (cluttered and dark).  My enjoyment of the food has varied - some meals have been pleasant whereas others (such as the flatbread) have been disappointing.  All in all, I doubt I'll visit either site again, which is a shame, as some of their meals have been tasty, but there are simply better options out there.<//review>

Day 4 is my current FAVE, the Jamaican Me Crazy burger and that was suggested by the lovely hard working associate cool girl at Eve Encinitas on Saturday 4-18-2020...fried plantain on a burger? YUP and add the coconut bacon! Ahhhhhh SOOO GOOD! Looking forward to enjoying the rest of the menu, one  beautiful meal at a time. I found out that it was a man who started Eve today...kinda thought that might be the case...EVE IS AMAZING and I am a Full supporter,  just Must say, she needs a bit more of an "Eve's touch" to her in a few ways. -Daughter< /Text>< rate>

< Review>
I live nearby, so was really excited to see that one of my favorite N. County restaurants opened another location. I usually order the same thing every time I go to Eve Encinitas (Truffled Mushroom Pasta). Man, was I floored when I tried it at this location! I didn’t know that dish could get even better!

It’s really comfortable inside—books, funky tables. I love where I live and rarely like to be anywhere but home, but I’ve actually thought about just going over to grab a drink and meal and hang out for a few hours.

The only thing I didn’t see (that’s at the other location) are their desserts and smoothies, but maybe I missed this somehow.

In any case, I’m going again tonight and bringing a friend with me!</Review>

<review>Eve’s location in Encinitas is wonderful, it is a relaxed atmosphere with conscious food options, it’s great to have a vegan option that is not loaded with soy products. I am grateful and excited that they are opening a new location in my neighborhood!

This is a blessing to a growing and renewing community.<//review>< date>

Ordered 11 dollar pitaya bowl came to me watery and melted missing multiple ingredients. There was no granola so they were supposed to substitute with peanut butter but didnt. I didn't have time to return it because I had to work. Called to ask for a compsation for another bowl.

<Review>I don't usually write reviews but while the food here was good, it wasn't worth it when the service is unbelievably bad. We came in and had to sit around waiting just for them to come and give us menus and even taking our orders took such a long time. The woman basically ignored us until we had to ask what to do. I was really excited that this place finally opened and it's sad to say we were so disappointed by the whole experience.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>This is a hard review to write because the food I have ordered so far has been really good. I go through Doordash and was really impressed with Eve's selections and taste. But today I got my order and a small roach crawled out of my flatbread box. I couldn't even eat anything in my order, I was so disturbed. They really need to get control of their problem. Otherwise, pre-roach incident, the food was good.< /review>< Name>

Like the Encinitas location, the Eve site in Oceanside is a great place to hang out and enjoy a vegan meal I was grateful that they would accommodate my preferences and food intolerances. Of course, the price is commensurate, but for a quality vibe and yummy food it's worth it .< /Review>

< Review>
First time eating at Eve's with a friend. Service needs improvement but the food was amazing (four stars 'cause of service).

We ate the  Luigi's Platter,  plenty of food for $11 and oh my Gosh, it was sooo delicious. We also had the Tomatoe Basil Flatbread and that was phenomenal and plentiful.

Will go back for the food, try new dishes.  I also had a nice cold pint of ginger kombucha.<//Review>

Been there twice now and had good, interesting food, with unexpected ingredients like seaweed in one of the bowls and pickled asparagus on a flatbed. Try it.</Text>

We drove 45 minutes to get there and there was no one even in there. It was just an abandoned cafe on the side of the road. Don’t be tricked and don’t go!!!</review>

Dr Ruben was very great with my son.  He was able to get down on his level and keep him calm throughout the whole visit.  I would highly recommend him for children’s dentistry!< /review>

I like this clinic the staff and doctor "S" are very kind.  My youngest child gives me a hard time when going to her pediatrician or dentist at this clinic the staff and Doctor "S" they do their best to make my daughter feel safe with them.  They do care about how she feels and make her feel comfortable.  I truly recommend this place, they work fast, clean place, kind people.  Great service for us moms with little ones.</Text>

<text>bad experience, my daughter had an appointment with the anesthesiologist yesterday at the corona location, the only issue was that I waited over an hour. Well when we got home she started getting a fever and pain and it wouldn't go away and gave her Tylenol. Today the fever hasn't gone away and I asked for a prescription and they can't even give me a prescription for fever or pain? What kind of children's dentist is this seriously. I don't recommend anyone coming here they don't care about the kids here</text>< pics>

<Review>I had the WORST experience here today. The Dentist does not work well with children. He lacks gentleness and patience. My 5 yr old went in to get her cavaties filled. She was terrified. Instead of talking to her and telling her whats going to happen. He rips her from my arms and puts her on the seat. Then he calls for help and the assistants hold
Down my daughter. The dentist then grabs my daughters face out of frustration and holds it very firm. He places the mask on and closes her lips with his fingers. And completely covers her mouth! My daughter was terrified. I finally say.. Its not working she looked like she was going to pass out.and i don't think she can breathe. Hes says if u are uncomfortable I can stop. I say get your hands off my daughter. This is enough!!! He was rude and unprofessional. And should NOT WORK WITH CHILDREN!! When I told the manager what happened she would not acknowledge what happened and told me that if I wanted to i could take her somewhere else. Handed me her paperwork and that was it! We are both traumatized.I cannot believe how rough he was with my little girl. I would never recommend this place!!!! Ever!!</Review>< UserId.>

<Text>I wouldn't recommend this place to people that don't have money laying around. I took my child there because he was having an issue with his teeth, they saw him and did the exam. Later in the visit they said that they require a $50 deposit to ensure he returns to get the services that he needs ( THAT INSURANCE COVERS 100%)<//Text>< Date>

<text>I had an appointment. I arrived 30 mins before my appointment. The lady at check in asked my child name. I gave it to her. She gave me the new patient paperwork. I waited almost 3 hours to be told there was a miss communication with the staff and that they were not able to take me in because the doctor left and to reschedule for another day. If there was an option for zero star I would put. Worst customer service ever!<//text><pics>None<//pics></record>

<Text>I took my daughter here years ago and he literally tortured her with a needle. She was only five or six years old and it was a little traumatic for her. He was such a rude and mean nasty person that even the receptionist was sheepish and I could tell wanted to apologize. I ended up taking her to my dentist in Santa Ana that I've had since I was a kid and she did not cry or make a fuss one single time.

<review>Yes, I USE to go to Dentistry 4 Kids. At first I didn't mind it. But the wait time is ridiculous. One to two hours, sometimes more. My kids would see a different dentist every visit. Personnel lack customer service. I do have to admit, that inside for kids is cool, dinosaur decor, kids movies to watch and video games for the kids to play while they wait their turn. But yes, they will keep asking you to make another appointment for something very simple, just to get more money out of the insurance company. I found a new dentist off of Indio, (whom they recommended only because they didn't provide a particular procedure, in which my daughter didn't need.) I go there now and will never look back at Dentistry 4 Kids.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80dcb0c7d8f5e12f:0x342d469affa06709</Gmap_id></record>

This place is a joke. The wait time is two hours plus for them to want to reschedule for simple procedures because they're backed up. Backed up in an understatement here, more like 20+ kids waiting for this ONE doc that is never the same doc. I'm going somewhere else I don't have all day to be sitting here.<//Text>

I took my 5 year old grandaughter with a tooth ache...I was very pleased with the friendly staff and the doctor...my grandaughter felt no pain during treatment..they used laughing gas I decided to take my other grandchildren and was very pleased...but what made me write this review is when they treated my daughter whom was super nervous at other places..she was given something to calm her down a long with  laughing gas and anesthetic..she did great...(by the way, I have 18 years experience in the dental field, so I knew exactly each procedure and was very pleased with materials used)<//Text>

The only thing that I don't like it is that when you come every six months for routine cleaning if you have like two or 3 kids you have to wait for the same dental assistant because they are from the same family, they have two dental assistants but you have to wait for the same person because we are from the same family no matter what if the dental assistant is lazy or impolite anyway you have to wait until she done with all members of your family.<//Text>

Awful Awful experience.  Starting from the moment you walk in it's just awful staff give you attitude the dentist are very rude on the braces side. I had a question for him and he answered me by say "yo what's up"? I said excuse me he then apologize. So unprofessional everything is disorganized the wait is 3 hours or more. Iam so glad I switched to a 5 start dentist everyone is so polite and very welcoming !</Review>

Great dentists they know what they're doing kids love the place it has a play area but of course if your child has cavities they're maybe not so happy afterwards which is normal but doctors handle every kid with care and professionally.<//Text>

Please read reviews. I didn't and took my my child there.  First appointment,  I waited over 4 hours.  Was told to come back next month for sealants.  By the way that's how they get to charge your insurance for two visits.  Second visit waited for an hour. This time, I spoke up. Yes I was that rude customer.  You have to be with these people. Read reviews,  DO NOT GO THERE. unless you have nothing to do on Saturday.</Text>

DO NOT GO HERE!! seriously take your child and run as fast as you can in the other direction. This dentist put unnecessary steel crowns on all 4 of my two year olds front teeth. Then to make matters worse he did such a terrible job that he had to get two of them removed because of infection and failure to remove all debris, This guy is  a quack and just wants your money. the ladies that work the front desk convey enough warmth to make a snowman shiver. Now my poor kid is terrified of dentists AND dinosaurs. Thanks dentistry for kids. you ruined my childs teeth for the next 3 years.<//review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>Unless you got alot of time to waste. Don't go here.  I've been taking my son here for many years. The dentist is great. Time management/scheduling from the office staff is a joke. My son had an 8:00 a.m. appt.  and I was told he would be the first one. I specifically asked the lady 6 months ago. That I wanted the early appt., because my son being special needs-I can't have him sitting around for 6 hours.  So when I signed in I noticed 2 other 8:00 a.m. appts.  Before me, that was fine. They took the first 8:00 at 8:30 then there was a sister, (I told her by the time my son they get to my son it would be 9:30) I told them that I was leaving, and I wasn't interested in coming back. And question what was up with mounting people on  top of each for appts.  I noticed on some of the comments people were complaining about that also.  I told her I have an 8:00 appt.  by the time you get to my son it will be 9:30 and it will be afternoon when we get out of there. I wasn't planning on spending my whole day there. I wouldn't recommend this place.</text>< pics>

Bad experience, my daughter is so scared of dentist now. I  though they will be children friendly and now how to treat kids. Nothing good, was so upset at dentist told them to stop and took her elsewhere. They should get into a different occupation, kids aren't for them. And the star was need for the post but should be negative five</Review>

Complete idiots, they gave my boy regular checkups but missed a huge cavity, the tooth needed to be pulled, by an oral surgeon. Instead of referring us they attempted the procedure, broke the tooth which went flying across the room. They then referred 2 of their other offices, telling us they needed 800$ to remove the pieces they broke off. They are idiots.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The deposit of 50 dollars does not return it. I know that I gave it because I had a short amount of money and to which the deposit is paid, it did not give me a receipt and when I stopped it I did not register it on the computer .. it was stolen from this place ...
The one of the cervisio I do not complain they take care of my children well ..

(Original)
El deposito de 50 dolares no lo regresan. Yo se bien que lo di por que me quede corta de dinero y a la que se le paga el deposito no me dio recibo y al parareser no lo registro en la computadora.. ya sali robada de este lugar...

< review>
Bought a vehicle, almost happy until I don’t receive the title. After so many attempts they were able to receive from seller then I eventually got it after paying $404.
Second car and last one I’ll be buying from here. Never making a mistake again< /review>

<Name>SAMA AUTO SALES<//Name><Date>1619645642265< /Date><Rate>1</Rate><review>I am a dealer ship used to deal with most of the auctions in the area and one of them Adesa Sacramento, but now on i will never deal with them due to the bad treatment of the front desk staff whom did many mistakes and made me go there for 3 times to pay for  the car i sold there and when i mentioned that i will stop dealing with this auction to them they didn't care  and took it with a lack of interest.
The main reason i am writing this review is the ignoring and non-respecting of the clients and their business.
I tried to get the information of there supervisor to report  but refuse to provide.
I will continue to find the contact way of there head staff to report for what happened to me.
Thank you for considering..<//review>< pictures>

Adesa Sacramento auction has very friendly staff is very helpful people on the lot to help you figure out how to purchase cars and how to get them off of lock. I found the whole process to be streamlined easy to use and do enjoy driving cars off the lot.< /review>

<text>Purchase the car Online Sale
traveled to Sacramento location
2 days later to pick up the car
bought & paid for
But then it took 45 minutes 4Me to no avail to find the bought car nowhere where they said they parked it last.
The space was there and empty space  after checking the surrounding area and end-to-end and row by row and lot by lot.
But I gave up & asked for HELP.
& they sent 1of their employees to find it & it took them 35 minutes to locate the online sold car was parked in the lot for tomorrow's
car sales. Betcha By Golly Wow

This is prime example of how stolen property is redistributed in America....

Let's look back in history when 40 acre stolen farmstead where redistributed to people.

These types of businesses shouldn't exist in our society.<//review>

<rating>1</rating><text>Attn: DEALERS if you're buying vehicles here in a lane with franchise dealer sticker IT’S A LIE.
Many wholesale/Retail dealers are friends with franchise dealers and sell vehicles under their franchise sticker. This has been going on for years. Continues to this day. So many buyers have been duped into thinking they are buying trade-in franchise vehicle but in reality it's a rejected problem vehicle being run through as a favor or a deal. No matter what response or correction promise this review gets, it will be a lie. Good luck buying here, just a matter of time until you get bit. Franchise dealers, management, some dealers (seems management knows and approves who they are) are all in it. Especially Maita lane.
Shame on ADESA for allowing this practice and looking the other way.<//text>< pictures>

I've always loved salt and pepper. They have the best flavored breakfast steak. No need to add any sauces. And now they have a brand new patio. Fabulous</review>

Will you should come in the middle of the week but this time we had a weekend off so we decided to head that direction for a Saturday mid morning breakfast. We ended up on the patio which was nice. The staff tried to keep up. But it was a little slow going. There is a definite difference from what you'll get during the week and what you did on the weekend. I think I'm going to stick with the weekday going. Staff is always friendly really super nice and food is pretty Nummy as well well</Text>

<Text>Excellent service Pablo was very helpful with all our questions and very polite!!  Since my friend was from out of state trying it for the first time and outdoor patio had heaters and was enclosed unlike any other restaurant that I've been to it made our experience amazing. I'm from orabge county and know how nothing really is open with AMAZING FOOD!! Food was hot and delicious even on this windy day. Definitely we will be back again before he leaves! thank God there's still good customer service out there and people that actually care about their customers!!❤️ 🙏<//Text></record>

<text>Im giving 5 stars. The burger looked small on the menu. But when it came for me i was shocked on the size of the burger. It was delicious though. Also the service is great here.< /text>< gmap_id>

Delicious little gem in Fullerton. Outside doesn't look too promising but the family atmosphere inside, great bar with nice huge new tvs for games and cheap beer. Can't beat it. Food is excellent and prices are moderate/low for the quality.< /review>

Love to have hot, fresh coffee during my meal and the waitresses and help keep my cup from going dry. One aspect l must bring up tho, they use to serve on Wednesdays an all you can eat beef rib bone dinner l loved! However they discontinued it... l was devastated. Breakfast, lunch , dinner and late night open 24 hours . In the neighborhood it's a must go!< /review><rating>5</rating><date>1584216980782<//date>< gmapID>

My Aunts go here to get dinner together pretty often and really enjoy it. They get the lamb dinner every year around the holidays. The staff is friendly and it has a good atmosphere.

Not a great place to eat as a vegan, but we all went there for drinks on my birthday and had a really great time! I recommend the Lemon Drop 😋🍸🍋<//review>

This place is a great little hole in the wall place with a diner touch. It has a diner side and a sports bar separated by a wall. The staff is pretty amazing and personable, pretty on top of things. They have different specials throughout the week. As far as food goes, they serve everything from seafood, American, Mexican, and a bit of Asian. Check it for yourself, doubt you'll be disappointed.</review>

This place is a hidden gem. I pass by it all the time. Had there Avocado breeze omelet, it was super cheesy and delicious. Lots of flavor going on. Portions are fulfilling. You can actually share with a tiny human.<//review>

And the guy who helped us and served or drinks was really friendly and funny, he made us laugh with his jokes and had such positive energy and attitude, he is definitely an asset to this place.
I recommend this restaurant. The 5 stars rating are definitely for the service more than the food.< /text>< Pictures>

I meet a old work buddy here on a regular basis. This is a great place for breakfast where the prices are hard to beat, the food is good and portions are plenty. Be sure to ask for the "specials" menu where things change from day to day.< /Text>

<Review>I was at stores elsewhere in the Plaza. Been to Salt and Pepper several years ago though. It's a favorite among local Fullertonites, and the food is decent enough. They have gigantic salt and pepper shakers on each table so that you can load your lime Jello up with black pepper....</Review>< rate>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>The food here is one step below average but still 1/4 of a mile from my house and because if this, I ate here out of convenience several times.  The last time I went here, I noticed that there was only CNN "fake news" playing on all of the TVs.  When I requested that one of the TVs be changed to FOX.  I was quickly told that FOX news was not allowed on the TVs.  Furthermore that even if they wanted it to be changed that is was actually blocked by the owner of this restaurant.   They informed me that they hated Trump and it would be a slim chance I would ever find a trump supporter in this restaurant.   Remove Trumps name out of the equation and what you would you have is an American that hasn't been this well off in a very very long time.  The owner of this restaurant obviously hates American.   I will never return to this restaurant and neither will the 30+ people I have told this story to.  It's a sad day in America where we are so ignorant that we cant dig into the news and see who is full of BS. Separate propaganda from facts and what you have is "Make america great again".  Go Trump! American patriots stand up and let your voice be heard!</review><Name>Shane Karzey<//Name></record></dataset><record>

60 years locals have been coming here 24-7 to eat, meet and drink.  Full sports bar inside, cafe coffe counter in the front.  Booth and table seating and open all the time.  Food is usually excellent and plentiful.  Its like coco's or dennys with good food and a full bar.  If you need to go someplace late at night this is a prime spot to go.< /text>

Salt & Pepper isn't my type of restaurant. I tried this location 3 times. Yes; the staff is nice. It does have an inviting, old fashioned ambiance. And my dad loves this place. Says it has the best Corn Beef and Hash. But for me, the food was just, "Okay."< /Text>

<Text>A small no frills family /sports bar restaurant. Simple food served fresh and quick served to you with smiles and friendliness. Easy, a great menu and better than spending 2 bucks at McDonald's across the street. Been going here for 20ish years. One of my go to fav's to go eat. I love this place... ❤️ ❤️ ❤️<//Text>< pictures>

I love this place,  I go all the time,  can't wait for the new location! The servers & owner's son are GREAT! They're so funny and helpful, a great family friendly place during the day and evening, then later is great for pizza and drinks. They remember the regulars and you're sure to have a laugh while here!</text>

<review>Good old diner. Usually pretty good but the all you can eat ribs went to my dog. They were boiled and then smeared with a so-so bbq sauce. Mostly fat and gristle. Made me a little sick trying to eat them. My friend loved her burger.<//review>< Pictures>

Awesome place for pizza, beer, salad (they're great) desserts and pretty much everything you can want. There's over 30 TV screens and they show all the major games and events. Definitely a staple in the City of Fullerton.</Review>

< Review>
My aunt took us here to eat because she had their burgers one time and thought they were delicious, 4 people from our 8 people group ordered burgers and they hated them because they were burnt. I guess you have to ask for the burgers grilled if you don't want them to taste like charbroiled. They never told us that until after and they gave my aunt a new burger and the other 3 never got a new burger and ended up not eating and I ordered the chicken alfrAlf, I didn't eat it either it had no flavor and I didn't like it at all. The only one who enjoyed their food was my sister who ordered a chicken sandwich with bacon. It was really delicious but very pricey.  Due to our horrible experiences I am giving this place a 1 star. The manager guy was really nice though the one who gave my aunt a new burger that was grilled.<//Review>

What a shame. Came in to pass a few hours late night as our car was in the shop closeby. The rental car fell thru so we hung out at our fave coffee house next door then thought we would grab coffee and a snack. Pretty good. Our waiter was awesome and when he left his shift another gal came in for. Her shift. Thought she was pretty nice. Explained about my car and she chatted a wee bit with us. We were actually getting ready to leave when 2 officers came in. Regulars. But one came up to us and said it was time we left that staff had said we'd been there awhile. . OMG! How awful! We werent scruffy or loud or asking for anything. Yes to 2 refills of coffee over the eve.  I will NOT be coming back. This is how NOT to treat a customer. We were cold and far from home. Karma....< /Text>

This place is a notch higher than Norms. I stopped going to Norms and came back to this place when I found out they were 24hrs.
Compared to Norms i love the service here at S&P a lot better. Also the pricing is around the same if not less than Norms. Norms has ridiculous wait times when you just have a party of 6 people.

This is the reason why I go here. Compared to any other 24hr diner chain I like this place best. The waiters are what makes the experience that much better. The club house sandwich & #1 breakfast are a must!</text>

Good service but food was dry, salad lettuce is brown, and rolls were hard. Plus food either had no flavor or over salted.< /Text>

<Text>This is an old-fashioned restaurant.  We dine here with friends regularly and I find it hard to find something edible on the menu.  Shrimp, steak and fettuccine Alfredo are usually decent meals.  French dip and quesadilla...Not so much.  Service is friendly and prices are OK.</Text>< date>

I do come here often. The food & service are always great. For the sports enthusiast this place has big screens through out the pub area. For the non drinkers the dining area is separate to keep the young ones from seeing the drinkers go crazy during games.< /review>

Go here often. The staff is no nice and friendly. Food is great. If you like pizza, there is none better. I order the double pepperoni. It's the best pizza I ever had.They also have live Califonia Lottery hot spot, and several big screens to watch any game that's on. Sunday during football season? You better get there early. They even have a scratcher machine for California lottery.<//text>

<review>This place is the worst dinner I've ever been to. The Hispanic guy who is the morning manager and the bus boys, dishwashers, and chefs cater to illegals because they are probably illegals. The owner and his son are good people. It's a shame they have trash like that employed there. They need to fire and hire new people that are more suitable for a family restaurant. The food tastes stale and like it had been frozen for a long time. There are dirty napkins and food particles on the floor and between the seat cushions. There's usually homeless people and tweakers camping out in the parking lot. The restrooms are gross. People go in there, get drunk and act like loud belligerent idiots. What a shame because this used to be a good place to eat a few years ago.<//review>< Name>

<text>Great selection of breakfast, lunch, and dinner items - kind of diner style.  Plus a sports lounge with full bar and pizza.  The food is very good, home-cooked style.  All the staff are friendly, accommodating, and helpful.< /text>< pics>

<text>This place is as much a part of my life as Houston ave where I came todippingto grow up since 1976. This place has come a long way since it was a Spires. At 16 I sometimes could be found writing in my journal at the bar at 2-3 in the morning, drinking cup after cup of Joe, dipping crispy bacon into a piping hot side of country gravy. or chickfried steak and eggs...like now. I will be 55 yrs old this year... I wonder if I qualify for a senior discount??? I freaking love this place!<//text>< Time>

Love the wonderful SERVICE and especially their groin-grabbingly-good FOOD! I usually go late at night when I need my RIB EYE fix! Medium Rare! Very friendly employees. COFFEE is really strong! Just the way I like it. I would definitely come eat here if I want something satisfying! And one more thing... POKESTOP. That is all. ✔💯< /review>

Good food good prices and great place to watch a game with happy hour prices......update: still a great place to eat but now they don't have those Monday - Friday specials anymore. No more beef ribs Wednesday but the pork chops are cooked perfectly.</Review>

< review>
I especially make it a point to go for the Broasted Chicken $7.99 Special on Thursday nights! It is Ssooo Very Good! And the soup offered is Tortilla Soup. Both are a 4.5 - 5 stars and I also rate the pizza a 4. It's good; in my opinion.

The customer service doesn't always or actually hardly come with all the smiles and congenial attitudes most would want and enjoy. But it is overall enough ...this area would help me to return more often. Besides, if the service  wasn't ample I would not return regardless of how good the food or prices were.< /review>

< Review>
This place used to be a decent restaurant . It has gone down hill fast. The food is of low quality and it tastes like cardboard. Food tastes like it's been frozen, then defrosted, then frozen again. Definitely it is not fresh food. This place hires illegal immigrants to bus tables, as dish washers, and as chefs, and I've seen them spit in the food. The restrooms are disgusting. I'm surprised the health department hasn't shut this place down. The restrooms are gang graffitied and are always filthy. There are crackheads and homeless people always hanging out in the parking lot. Gang members hang out in this place despite the fact that cops in uniform eat here everyday. People get drunk and out of control at the bar and when there are big sporting events. There is always trash under the tables and old food between the seat cushions in the booths. It takes forever for someone to take your order and forever for them to serve it to you. This place is not worth what they charge for the food and the service they provide. By the way, the fat ugly troll looking piece of trash cop that beat the homeless guy Kelly Thomas to a pulp in Fullerton is frequently seen there stuffing his fat face and talking trash.<//Review>

Food was OK, it's like a diner / coffeshop and sports bar all in one.  Prices are fairly reasonable but you're not going to be able to eat there on the cheap.  Portions are large.  Basically a greasy spoon with lots of TVs and sports games to watch.<//Text>

< review>
Went to have breakfast and watch my Steelers game.  There was only one table available but could not see the tv screen with the Steelers.  A table opened up right in front of the Steeler game so I went to move there, the manager wouldn't let me.  What ever happened to the "customer is always right"?  Apparently the staff couldn't handle a table-switch to make a customer happy.  To top it off, they got my order wrong.  If it wasn't for my boyfriend being with me, I would have walked out.
