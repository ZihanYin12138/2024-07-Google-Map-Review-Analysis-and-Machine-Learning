This site is a huge scam! Do not use it. I tried using because I could do a video conference with a celebrity , because there was an event, it did not work at all. I clicked join the event and them clicked on the link and it showed me nothing. I spent a lot of money for this event. What a disappointment! They don't even have a customer service for customers. SUCH A SCAM AND A RIP OFF!!!!
Hope this site closes down and no one uses it ever again.</review>

We had an event that needed postponed due to Covid. We have now decide to cancel the event and give full refund to our guests. Eventbrite has locked our dashboard, so we can not make changes and have taken all our tickets sales and wont allow us to have a refund. To refund our guests it now has to come out of our own pocket. We have tried to contact them anyway way we can and NO response. And their contact page does not work.< /Review>

Horrible horrible company. Our event was cancelled but we were never notified by Eventbrite or the organizer. We found out about it from the Facebook event page.

I contacted Eventbrite and they said to go to the organizer. Well guess what the organizer filed bankruptcy in March and rescheduled the event to a date after which refunds were not possible.

I went back to Eventbrite and they said sorry nothing they could do. I found out today that these con artists have a form to fill out to get a refund. Their terms make it all but impossible to get a refund, this form was not there when I called the first time.

NEVER EVER use these con artists. It sucks because some events and groups I am a part of use these grifters. I refuse to give a single penny of my money to them. Looks like I will miss out on stuff for the groups I am with.</Text>

I had an event postpone indefinitely due to Covid. I have tried contacting the event organized, zero response. I tried contacting Eventbrite through a request form, all I received was a generic email back. I’ve tried looking for a phone number or email address to reply to, cannot locate on their website. Very disappointed with their handling of event changes.<//Text>

Overall the website worked well. Unfortunately I have been unable to get my money out of 1 of my 3 courses I taught. My information has been correctly input into their system. Sad I cannot get ahold of anyone ... they dont seem to be responsive. So user beware. Use paypal instead of eventbrite so you can actually get your money back</review>

Horrible experience. Wish they allowed negative stars.
Booked tickets for an event on a 'certain' date. Organizer 'lean agile solution' postponed the event. Provided new dates and asked if I could attend or need refund. Said would take '3-5' business days for the refund. I opted to get a refund since the 'new dates' wouldn't work for me. Its been more than 8 business days and I didn't receive any confirmation about the refund status. Forget about the actual refund. Going to involve my bank and get the charge disputed.
Stay away from  Lean Agile Solution as well as eventbrite. They are running a scam/fraud.< /text>

WINE AND CHOCOLATE CRUISE IN SF BAY

My boyfriend and I went on the Wine and Chocolate cruise in SF bay , it was nice to be out on the water BUT the boat was way too crowded. The actual cruise doesn't match the marketing , the chocolate and wine were tiny little samples to make you pay for a whole bottle or box of chocolates.....not worth it</Review>

<text>Hated it, because they did not provide a secure, trustworthy product.

Another entity was allowed to create another page, duplicating our information, and linking it to their account.  They posted their prices at half our official pricing, and they had no authority to do so.  Used the same venue, same date, same time, same talent, same image, same text... but made it lower, so people would go to their page and purchase, instead of our official page.

Search my key words, and up pops, another unauthorized page selling tickets right under ours, for half the price.

How does Eventbrite deal with this?  They help cause more confusion, buy telling buyers they bought a fake ticket... Now, I don't know about you (my fellow event producers), but do you think if you were told you bought a fake ticket, you would trust the company and purchase another ticket on the same site?

ON TOP OF THIS... AFTER THEY REMOVED IT... IT HAPPENED AGAIN 1 WEEK LATER.
I'M IN SHOCK, AND IT IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.

Beware.  They cannot guarantee that this won't happen to you.  Do a high profile competitive event, and allow this to happen to you on their site...  Anyone have a solid company that insures that this wouldn't happen to you, please let me know, because in my opinion, Eventbrite can't handle large value events.<//text>< user_id>

<text>This is a scam, I purchased VIP tickets for the Galaxy bar in Hollywood at the Chinese Theater through Eventbrite & the bar has not been there for 2 weeks, I'll definitely be calling to complain & get a refund....and they're still selling tickets for the 22nd...don't buy, it's no longer there!</text></record></dataset><record>

If a ZERO is possible I would give it to eventbrite! I have not been able to access my account for a week and they have a customer service person name Michelle who refuses to provide me any type of customer service than to tell
Me to log into and account I can’t get into because I no longer have access to the email!!!!!  Or to check their Help Center!

This is not a free service because they make money off of ticket sales! This is completely unacceptable. Get me tech support to get into my account.< /Text>

Eventbrite is working with scammers selling tickets to overbooked events, and would refuse refunds. It would also disinform AmEx telling them goods/services were receive, when in reality the tickets are worthless.<//review>

This is probably the worst event organizer I have ever bought tickets off of. 1- I havent gotten my tickets in the mail 2- they havent answered any of my calls 3- They are extremel vague when e-mailing back to you and they definitely take some days to do it as well< /text>

Eventbrite is an excellent company, and a rapidly growing one at that. They build software for event organisers to control ticketing and the flow of people to their event.</text>

Typically traditional southeastern themed strip mall. The whole place is a little out of date, but the variety of food and service available is abudent the place that sells roast duck has done it's job that that they usually sold out almost everything by early afternoon.< /review>

Great place! here is some short story for you!
One time in my chemistry class, while the teacher was talking, this guy asked loudly, “Does anyone have any lotion?” The teacher stopped talking as some girl gave him some hand lotion.

The guy proceeds to slowly rub the lotion on his face as the whole class watches him in confusion.

The teacher asks him what he’s doing, and he responds with “I forgot to moisturize this morning” and puts even more on his face.

The teacher asks him to go to the hall to finish his moisturizing because he’s being a distraction, and after about 10 minutes he still hasn’t come back in, so someone opens the door to check and he’s still smearing lotion all over his face. He finally comes back in and hands the girl her lotion, and he’s used up half of it. Now people call him lotion boy.</Text>

<Review>I think it's a great place. The edibles are string and very reasonably priced.  There is always a good choice of flower. And, daily deals plus a stamp card make it easier to save. Staff is nice and knowledgeable. Highly recommend!!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Great place. The guys in the lobby is awesome. Some of the staff is too, a couple of the girls could use some training on how to not sit around twirling their hair. But overall it's a good shop.<//review>

I came here last summer and was so excited to return. I remember when I came last summer the security was funny, the staff was helpful, and wearing masks and they were very knowledgeable about the florals and gummies they had in stock. WELL, I came in today and it was a different story. Security didn’t want to be bothered. Once I passed security, everyone greeted me with a frown and without a mask. WHERE IS YOUR MASK!!!!??? I would ask a question to the young man who decided to help me and he literally could not answer any of my questions and I had to restate them every time. I didn’t see the signs that you cannot talk on the phone so when I was on the phone another service rep rudely told me to go outside. If you would like your customers not to use the phone while inside, please make signs that say do not talk on the phone.  Posting a graphic with a stop sign over a cell phone is very vague and unclear and your customer service reps need need help with grace and care when enforcing rules and regulations. The attitudes were so terrible when I asked them about their form of payments that I just turned around and left. Just because this place sells marijuana, does not mean that they can have these terrible attitudes...there’s too many dispensaries in Los Angeles to deal with bad customer service.</Review>

She was a short mexican woman with dark chocolate skin colour and wore white shorts which kind of made her look like a s'more. She had pretty eyes that dazzled and a welcoming , charming attitude about dealing with me. If I were a average, slack jaw fool, I would of probably believed that I had a chance or there was something more than business to conduct. She was nice and professional and had a smile to give a hopeless man dreams to go home too. Other than that short minute of experience in this shop.. I dont know what else to say.< /Text><userid>100541724290192879547</userid><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>

<Text>New default dispensary. Friendly, good vibes, and very attentive to customers AND to COVID compliance. Good deals, good tree, edibles hit..  I’m lucky to be 4 minutes away!

<Text>STICKY FINGERS, NO MASKS, AND BAD ATTITUDES!  Careful when you shop here, you may not always get what you pay for. I was an AVID customer for 6 months, but won't be back again. I was in the shop on Wednesday (2/3/21) and purchased 14g plus a pre-roll - but one of the 8ths that I purchased was missing from my order. Also, none of the bottles were labeled. After quickly realizing this once returning home, I called and spoke with a rep - who was very helpful - and explained to her that the person who was helping me I believed forgot to put the 8th in my bag and that I wanted to confirm if the 8th was still on the counter possibly. She quickly told me that it was not on the counter, but that she would contact me after she spoke with management and they reviewed the security cameras. I then received a text 40 minutes after I made the call telling me to return to the shop. So, I called to speak with the rep again and confirm what happened - who then stated that Management reviewed the cameras and confirmed that what I said was true. To put things into perspective, I was IN THE SHOP at around 5:00 pm, returned home and MADE MY CALL at 5:16 pm, RECEIVED THE TEXT at 5:57 pm, called to CONFIRM W/ MANAGEMENT WHAT HAPPENED at 6:10pm. I was already on my way to work, so I asked her if I could come in the next day, Thursday (2/4/21), and she said that was fine and that there would be a note on my account. So, I come in on Thursday not only to receive the 8th that was missing from my order as well as to purchase ANOTHER 14g of a particular strain I'd been looking for.  No one was masked, there wasn't a note on my account, Management said that though they remembered me that they would have to check the cameras again and the male budtender who helped me (the same person who helped me on Wednesday), A, patronized me as I made my purchase with a series of insulting questions and ended up giving me VERY SMALL buds (see pictures). If you come here, you will have to be very firm with your bud tenders as they cut corners! This place just isnt' work the risk to your health or your wallet. They have lost my money and my referrals.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAByReqKXEPQOwI4nIC04FUBw0rSDjsaaUGxsf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsrmr0lkw8zLz1OdDHZbngSO3wr_3rnlW8gQ5F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< resp>

It is probably my favorite Marijuana place I usually go. Just because it always has pretty well sativa from top or private reserve shelfs for the cheapest price in Town. In addition they have special deals every day!</review>

<text>Buyer beware!  I'm new to this so I was a first timer there.  When I tried it out I couldn't feel anything.  Keep in mind I hadn't tried anything for months so I"m not a "pot head".  I called them and the lady was nice and said go there and talk to them.  We spoke nicely.  I'm super nice, and overly nice most of the time but for some reason they said I can't even go in and buy other stuff aside from me accepting I'll just toss what I got before into the trash.  It seemed so bizarre.  The guy showed a lady something on the screen as if it said I'm CIA hehe.  I'm sure most of the time they are fine but why would you sell bad product and not at least allow someone to buy something different.  Maybe they were afraid  but I was super nice.  I'm not one of the angry peeps, I was just agreeing when they said no.<//text><UserId.>105812983876904396111<//UserId.>< user_name>

These dudes are absolutely great! I bike 2 hours each way to get their stuff - they don't do fancy packaging and big shiny stuff, but their edibles are absolutely bang on and their indicas pack a punch. Thanks, dudes.</Review>

Do not buy cartridges from this store. I spent $40 on a cart that was old and the wax moved more fluidly than water which is a terrible sign. What they sold me will go straight in the garbage as I showed it to them and they told me no exchanges. I know the routine and know they must be aware their product is bad so don’t let them take advantage of you.</text>

BUYER BEWARE: THEY ARE KNOWINGLY SELLING ILLEGAL VAPE CARTRIDGES & NOT AN AUTHORIZED RETAILER FOR WHAT THEY ARE SELLING!  GREAT PRICES ON VAPE STUFF BECAUSE IT IS FAKE!!

NOT ON WEEDMAPS:  SEE YELP FOR MORE ACCURATE REVIEWS.  HOPEFULLY THEY WILL BE SHUT DOWN PERMANENTLY AS THEY HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO HEAVY HITTERS, BRASS KNUCKLES, BUREAU OF CANNIBUS CONTROL, CA DEPT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. ALTADENA SHERIFF DEPARTMENT HAS ALREADY SHUT THEM DOWN DUE TO NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS.  THEY DO NOT HAVE A LICENSE TO OPERATE.< /review>

< Review>
Been coming here for a good six months already, by myself, with friends, co workers, and family. The food and customer service is amazing. By far the best Chinese food in all of Sanger and possibly in all of the Fresno area. The portions are huge, the prices are great, and it’s delicious. It’s really clean, and the waitresses get to you quickly. The customer service is great, and they always make sure to keep the customer happy. It’s almost always the same two waitresses Aribel and Veronica so your guaranteed to get your questions answered and your order correct. If you are considering trying this place out, DO IT!<//Review>

The best Chinese food in Sanger.  You'll have to go outside of town for anything of better quality.  The salt and pepper fish is pretty good.<//Text>

We are giving this restaurant a 1 star due to costumer service. My family and I walked in after soccer practice to enjoy a family dinner. We were seated quickly which started off great, but it took a very long time to have our order placed. We were about to walk out and leave but decided to give it a try. But as the night went on, I regret staying.The food was good. A 7 out of 10. When it came to pay, my wife and I were questioning our bill, because the price appeared to be too high for what we had ordered. When asked for the ticket they brought the original receipt with prices. My wife and I added up the total with our calculator on our phone and the math was not correct. We were OVER charged by 12.00. When we respectfully brought our concern to the waitress on duty, She immediatly got defensive and immediately blamed the other waitress who had left. My wife and I did not come off as aggressive or upset we just wanted to make sure we were charged appropriately. We even told her, (because she seemed way more upset than we did, mind you we were the ones over charged) we weren't trying to blame her, we just wanted to make sure it was done correctly. We waited for an apology but instead she walked to the back where the kitchen was. She then came back and rang us up at the correct price. That was the end of our dinner. No sorrys, no thank you for coming in, no have a good night as all customer service industries thrive on. The customer and their experiences at their business is ehat makes the buisness thrive and customers coming back. But because of poor customer service we will not be returning. We hope no one else has the same experience  my wife and young children had on October 17th, 2019.< /Review>

Noodle soup was not what I expected. But the broth was decent. Fried rice was a little to sweet. To much soy sauce into the rice. It's an okay place.< /Text>

<text>Might have tastes good but we gave up on service. A party of five plus a toddler and nobody came to take our order or even say hello. If I could have given it 0 stars I would have. 30 minutes to wait to give an order is way too long. Especially since five groups walked in after us were seated,waited on and even received food!</text>< Name>

As far as Chinese restaurants go, I felt I had to wait too long for my food.  However, the chow mein was a large portion for the price I paid.  In Sanger, the best bet for Chinese.< /Text>

For Sanger we can't complain about it because not much to choose from food was good but they always seem short handed.</Review>

(Translated by Google) The price a bit high compared to other Chinese restaurants. But their food is very good the portions are quite enough. The place is clean and cozy except for its floor is fine because it is ceramic tile. But it lacks a more thorough cleaning this happens to all floors. Your staff is friendly. If you want to eat good Chinese food here is this place. Sometimes the cheap turns out to be expensive.

(Original)
El precio un poco elevado en comparación a otros restaurantes chinos. Pero su comida es muy buena las porciones son bastantes. El lugar es limpio y acogedor excepto por su piso esta bien pues es cerámic tile.  Pero le falta una limpieza más profunda esto le pasa a todos los pisos. Su personal es amable. Si deseas comer comida china buena aquí está este lugar. A veces lo barato sale caro.< /review>

<text>The quail egg was delicious! I feel a little bad for eating it, because it was so little. 🐣
So, the only suggestion is too get gluten free panko crumbs. Cook it in different oil, then I'll be able to eat all the delicious rolls. Other than that, great customer service. Our waiter asked questions, and found the answers I needed for my dietary needs. Very accommodating. 😊😃 5 🌟 Service.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvvZxygtBktey-3MjlcbaR68n79HMYyWnB6KSD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Don’t order the California deluxe. Super nasty like a pastry and fish crossover.
Scallops were drenched in sesame oil. Some people might like that but personally wasn’t my favorite

Price was great ($28.95+tax/person) for dinner. Lots of options!

Service was slow, by the time we got our second plate the two of us were full and it was only our first round of ayce.< /Review>< gmapID>

<review>Absolutely wonderful Japanese food at reasonable prices! Dozens of types of sushi, the tuna sashimi is lovely, they have many hot entrees and the tempura  has just the right crunch.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>Really spectacularly excellent value.

All you can eat, big menu, great sushi, quick service. Kind of hard to find parking and we were lucky to not have a wait for a table, but it was a wonderful evening. Ate too much.

Would recommend to anybody with a big appetite who loves sushi.<//Review>< gmap_id>

Great selection of rolls and nigiri on ayce menu. They could use a little less rice as they're heavy handed, even on non ayce menu.< /Review>

< Review>
Great presentation for AYCE. Made it seem like it was a regular sushi dinner night out. The fish and rolls are too sweet or maybe it was the sauces used, or the rolls we chose. Regardless the dining is outside and spaced out, which is good. But the food did give all of us stomachs aches that night, which was unfortunate and disappointing.<//Review>

<review>I've been going here for a few years, and have never been disappointed.
Sandwiched in between a nail salon and vacuum store, I didn't originally feel like this was very well placed, but being in a strip mall I guess that's not always a choice.
I always go for the sushi, but have tried numerous other items on the menu. Yesterday was exceptionally busy as we went during the lunch hour and Paradise Sushi is clearly a favorite for an afternoon break.
In spite of the hustle and bustle, we were greeted and seated mediately. Our waitress was prompt, friendly, and always efficient. Food was delivered within a reasonable amount of time & looked like art on a plate.
Parking can be a challenge during the lunch hour, but its a huge parking lot so there's always something - just might be a bit of a trek...
Highly recommend!<//review>< Pics>

I love this place. How in the world can they afford to serve us all of the specialty sushi we can eat!?! And yet they do! they made a lot of changes over the years to keep that system working, and they really have gotten better about the logistics of managing how things used to take too long to arrive. The sushi is also quality, the selection is nicely varied, the customer service is always good, and you can't beat the price! I like the fact that they keep tweaking the system to make it better, but every iteration has produced delicious all you can eat sushi at a fantastic price, so we just keep coming back over and over again!</Text>

The food’s good... just good. But the staff is dreadful. They seem bothered whenever you ask for anything. And now they have this “2020 policy” where if you leave food behind, you’ll be charged $1 per piece... I’m taking off a dollar from their tip for every piece I leave behind. I’m fighting petty with petty, challenge accepted! Lol<//Text>

I really want to rate this place better but we had bad scallops. Both of us ended up sick the next day and we didn't even finish the scallops. It's really disappoints me because everything else was amazing. Between the two of us we cleared a good portion of the menu. And all of it (minus the scallops) was fantastic. But at the end of the day I can't return or suggest any place that serves bad fish.</Text>

I have mixed opinions usually on all you can eat sushi places. I usually don’t find rolls I like a lot and never go back. Paradise has two of my favorites. The Paradise Role and the Carburetor. Staff is always nice, great sushi chefs. Easy parking. Delicious!< /text>

Visited for late lunch and ordered chicken udon. Place was about 1/3 full, service was attentive.

Took longer than I expected for a noodle soup, but wait was acceptable. Very generous amount of chopped chicken but skimpy on udon noodles. Broth came piping hot. Overall it was good.<//Text>

Paradise Sushi does not dissapoint at their Petaluma location. We arrived close to closing, but were promptly seated and served by a bubbly and cheerful staff. The restaurant was SO busy, but the service was still amazing! As usual, the all you can eat sushi was fresh and flavorful. Thanks for a great meal!!<//Text>

<text>Okay this is almost like a sushi buffet. I did not expect much out of it I would say it is between two and three star sushi but the place overall is five stars because they treat it like a good sushi and the server's weights you and they're nice and kind just like you're going to a high-end restaurant. The price matches the quality you're not going to spend a whole lot but it is not like going to Hana in Rohnert Park<//text><Response>None< /Response>< UserId.>

8/1/2020
I have been here for almost 45 min and all we have got is 3 Nigiris. Usually this place is busy, but because we got here after lunch it is not. There are 4 tables and tables that came after us are already eating and we still waiting.
Really frustrating and not happy at all right now.</Text>< pictures>

Yummy rolls,but VERY-very limited choice of AYCE lunch (compare to mostly Canadian buffets),  no BBQs, no tempuras, only miso soup complementary :(
Crystal shrimps hand roll and phily rolls are very tasty 👍

If you want to eat a lot (more than two special rolls) of rather good sushi (a bit above average for the area), you can't beat Paradise's all-you-can-eat prices.  Otherwise... It's still pretty good.< /review>

Great all you can eat sushi deals.  Their happy hour is from 4 to 6 pm and has deeply discounted draft beer and saki.  The staff are always pleasant and willing to tweak their sushi rolls to accommodate your taste.  Good job guys!< /Review>

<review>Good food - traditional Japanese American, which is great, but nothing particularly unique. Decent location - lacking outside aesthetic appeal, and parking will be difficult depending on the time of day. It is right downtown though, so if you plan on catching a movie or getting drinks after, you'll be all set. The interior is very comfy and appealing, and the staff couldn't be better.

Edit: went back recently and was entirely unimpressed. If there was an expensive Taco Bell equivalent of Japanese food, this would be it. Hint: don't get the"chef's choice" roll unless you want to eat $8 worth of carrot.<//review>< pictures>

We have been here several times and have never been disappointed. We usually get the all you can eat sushi and go to town. They make it to order so it's not like you're getting a roll that has been sitting out all day. Fish quality is good and we have had no conplaints from anyone we have taken to here.< /review>

So it's not the best sushi I've ever had, but come on, its all you can eat! It's great for what it is. I love the staff too. I always sit at the bar so I can watch them do their thing. Lots of fun!</Review>

< Review>
Birthday dinner DISAPPOINTMENT - food is ALWAYS great at the Petaluma location, however last night my birthday dinner was super disappointing. We were in a group of 8 - had a reservation - server pretty much ignored us the entire evening.  He received a mandatory 37.46 gratuity despite the fact that we had to wait for long periods of time for food that we could see was ready at the counter.  Our server had plenty of time to spend long periods of time chatting with all the smaller tables of 2 - 4 parties... My water glass was never refilled.  We were there 2 hours!  It felt like the poor service was intentional, due to the fact that his tip was guaranteed.  We've been to this location many times, and NEVER experienced this lack of service before.  Don't go for special occasions or in larger groups to Paradise - they can't handle it...</Review>

Not the best sushi I've had, but it's a pretty great all-you-can-eat option in a convenient location. They have a Santa Rosa location for a little better atmosphere. It gets busy on the weekends, so prepare for a wait if you go during those peak times. It's a no frills small room with minimal decorations so not the most beautiful place to eat, but hey...All you can eat! The lunch price is slightly less expensive then dinner. So I like to go early and miss the crowds and eat for less. Walk it off after with a easy stroll over the bridge and you're in downtown Petaluma.</text>

Everyone keeps telling me how awesome and cheap this place is...I guess they have some all-you-can-eat deal at dinner. I've been here twice in 6 months, both times for lunch, and it's only just ok. Their rolls are ordinary, their selection is ordinary, their prices seem really high. The lunch special with miso and rice is like $15.</text>

The food is not authentic. Most of the items on the menu were either deep fried or filled with creme cheese. If it wasn't deep fried or filled with cream cheese it was drenched in mayonnaise or other sauces. Every piece of nigiri fell apart as I picked it up with chop sticks as it wasnt very well made. The nigiri also didn't come with wasabi, despite me not asking for no wasabi. It was just the default way they make it. Come here if you want a mediocre, and American version of sushi. This place is not authentic and not very good.<//review>

This place is amazing. It can get a little crowded and the service can feel a little slow, although may just be because I am usually starving when I arrive as well as excited to eat the sushi.</review>

Have no illusions but know this is a solid spot for AYCE sushi,rolls, and hand rolls. The service is friendly and so are the sushi chef's.

A great value if you eat sushi nigiri and temaki style. Fish quality isn't bad, just bear in mind you're not here for omakase.<//Text>

I really enjoy their all you can eat dinner.  They have several amazing rolls, the ninja roll and my carburetor roll were my favorites, and I wish I'd been able to try the civiche roll everyone raves about.  You should know that service is very slow and you will be there a long time if ordering all you can eat.  The waitresses are usually nice.<//Review>

I have been going here for years. Our server yesterday ruined my desire to ever return. Not only was she rude, and lazy, but I left no tip (for the first time in my ENTIRE LIFE) She filled out my tab and gave herself a ten dollar tip!!!! I'm contacting the owners, and reporting credit card fraud. Great food, 1 bad employee. Beware of the only blonde working Saturday at noon.<//Text>

All you can eat sushi for about $19 a person for lunch. A lot of rolls to choose from and good quality. Don't make the rookie mistake like I did and not ask how many rolls comes with 1 order, which is about 10pcs.<//Text>

Sushi is good. All you can eat is,a good deal, but dont expect to bring home leftovers so order wisely. ALWAYS hot in there. If they turned up the A/C more i'd give 5 stars</text>

<Text>Very disappointed. My family and I go there at least 2 times per month and today my llittle brother decided to bring his own slide of pizza and eat it inside the restaurant while we ( 5 adults) order for us. The manager decided to tell us to leave the restaurant while all the employees were laughing in the backgorunds. My family and friends will no longer take out business here. Awful service for a loyal customer.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Favorite place for AYCE but their rice is a little stale sometimes. Fish is always great and price for value is totally worth it. I drive in from San Rafael just for the amazing lunch. 10/10 coming back every week.<//Review>

Better service in Rohnert Park. Check was dropped off after 1 roll for AYCE. Had to ask for refills, not very good service. Sushi is delicious.<//text>

Avoid this place. Horrible experience, slow service, a very rude waitress. It was unhappy Valentine's day.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Definitely the best and without comparison ... Simply very good experience from the beginning to the dessert ..

Maybe I even dare to say that your second location is the same or better than this.
Visit any of the 2 restaurants you will surely return with your friends.

Maybe something you can improve would be your liqueur options

(Original)
Definitvamente  de lo mejor  y sin comparacion...Simplemente muy buena experiencia desde el pricipio hasta el postre..

Quiza hasta me atrevo a decir que su segunda locacion es igual o mejor que este.
Visita cualquiera de los 2  restaurantes seguro regresas con tus amigos.

Quiza algo que pueden mejorar seria sus opciones de liqueur</Review>

Guys were nice although the guy that was cutting my hair ezbai i think his name was is very in experienced, asked for a simple high fade and he couldn't even do that. And to top it off the back of my hair is super choppy and he took a chunk off and didn't know how to fix it apparently so he didn't..... pretty awful haircut tbh</review>

Hands down the best haircut I've ever gotten. And the beard trim is on point. Honestly the best 35 bucks I've ever spent. Great atmosphere and everyone working is super cool. Ask for frank when making an appointment. Dude knows how to cut hair. Won't ever go to another place.<//Review>

<review>Seriously not enough stars!!! I wanted a haircut that had both men's and women's hairstyle aspects and I had previously been turned away from a salon. I went to Single Barrel last minute and Frank was available to take me. He did what he did best, the men's shaving part, and then Carmina, the owner of the shop as well as a stylist on her side of the business, stepped in and magically cut my hair to EXACTLY what I was looking for. They work as a team, keep things so light and fun, and their prices are so reasonable! I'm from GA but when I come back to Fullerton, I'm probably going to go back to SB to visit and get another cut!!!<//review><Name>Taylor Edson</Name><gmapID>0x80dcd5f7e93fd321:0xb1407267f523c1c2< /gmapID><userid>103802161602644329218</userid>< Resp>

Loved the haircut my son got, Isaac cut his hair and my very picky son who HATES getting his hair cut, was actually very happy with his new look.<//Text>

I was 3000 miles from home in need of a haircut.. So I jumped on google and landed at Single Barrel Barber Shop. I was able to get in with Jessica. I was a little nervous, being I've had the same barber for about 20 years, but a few minutes in I could tell I was in good hands. Jessica was super cool and made it look easy. I couldn't have been happier with my cut and beard trim. Great overall experience and I would highly recommend. Super cool place with good vibes. Thanks again!<//Text>

First time here but it was a great experience. It’s appointment only but they can accommodate the same day. They take their time and really try to get to know what you really want. The best of all, I was able to Venmo my stylish!< /Review>

This joint is located in the awesome Downtown Fullerton. It's part of the Tattoo shop. The best thing about this Shop is that it closes at 9 pm. I also have issues finding a place that is open when I get off from work. So this place may be my new place. The Barber was great, he took care of me. He had a nice setup and knew what he was doing. I'll be back in a couple of weeks.<//Text>

< Review>
I am not a person that is able to make appointments because of work and my son is always with me but one day I called and spoke to Jessica. She told me to go on and I did. I've been living in OC for less than a year and haven't found a barber because not many understood what I wanted until I met jessica. I would go to other shops with product in my hair so that they can see what I wanted and cut it based on how Idid my hair and they would fail. I went to Jessica with no product on my hair and she cut it exactly like my old barber did. Any person that is loyal to their barber knows how hard it is to find someone as good or greater. I found a greater barber with Jessica. I had my son with me, of course, and she was patient with him sitting on my lap and walking around. Not saying she is a baby sitter or to take your kids with you everytime but definitely a great plus when barbers dont ruin your hair because they are focused on our child.<//Review>

Amazing customer service. Brian was awesome! Very friendly and skilled. He took his time and asked a lot of questions to make sure my man's cut was on point. He wasn't awkward at all, kept the conversation going. The shop itself was very cozy. Not too much seating, but we went in a little late so there wasn't any people. The great thing about it is they do take walk-ins and they are open late. So its convenient for those last minute cuts. Appointments are better tho, so your cut is guaranteed. The only thing that threw us off was the tattoo shop. There's two ways to get into the shop..thru the tattoo side and then the opposite side.Will definitely be coming back tho! Ask for Brian! You won't be disappointed.< /Review>

<time>1569245603402</time><Rating>2</Rating><text>Called in for a walk in on Fri last week due to the time they close they were the only place around that was open. I call and a Lady answers the phone, tells me to come in and that they cut coarse curly hair often. I proceed to get my hair cut by the same lady who I talked to on the phone. I told her to leave the length on the top which she did and give me a fade to skin and a line up. She butchered my line up and tried to save it by shadowing it. Which made it worse. Then when it came to my beard I asked for a very slight trim. She practically took the whole thing off. She spent more time on my beard than my hair. Then to top it off. It was 40$ without a razor fade. I will not be returning back here. But hey at least they're open till 10<//text>< Name>

I can’t express how amazing the results were! My expectations were beyond met. I’ve tried many barbershops in the area including “Stache House Barbers,” but I rather suggest you visit this place. It’s a bit hidden but is still visible from the Main Street (Harbor Blvd) on DTF. The barber, Brian, put a lot more attention to details and making sure the haircut was perfect, than I’ve seen from any other barber. Thanks for the cut!

Edit: The location was moved a few stores up the street (still in DTF). Brian no longer works there after disputes with the owner. He was one of the first people to start the business and really helped them grow. He deserves better! My understanding of their relationship could be misinterpreted. But from what I here is he comes from San Bernardino and now opened his own barbershop out there which is closer to home and on his own terms. Hope you’re doing great!

Overall the staff there is still great! Good cuts and somewhat decent prices (much more expensive than what it used to cost, and reasonably higher than other places in the area). Used come in my motorcycle and get my cuts and washed off for $25 + tip. Now I look at least $35 + tip. Friendly and funny staff. Always a conversation going.

This is my personal opinion: Stache House Barbers is my go to from now on. The environment and barbers there seem to fit better with me now.< /Review>

< review>
I have been a long time patient.  I cannot say enough good things about  Family First Family Medical Practice with Dr. Susan Nasser.    I consider her and her medical staff  the best family medical care team in the area (they did win the Best of the AV award for 2020 and it is truly well deserved)!    Dr. Nasser holds herself and her staff to the highest standard, not only in technical excellence but also in their compassionate and caring character.  You will love the office staff, so kind, with so much personal attention, and they always go that extra mile to ensure the patient is well taken care of.   In spite of being the "Best of the AV", they are still always focused on continuously improving their quality of service.   I always thank the office staff for being so great, and I hope they understand that I truly mean it.   If you are looking for a primary care provider, you will not be disappointed.   They have set a new bar for the rest of the medical community in the area.   So great to have them in the AV.<//review>

The staff is always friendly and very professional. The office and rooms are clean and comfortable.  It is also very nice, as I've never had to wait for any long periods of time. And a plus is the way they schedule, there is never a waiting room full of patients.<//review>

<Text>I have been seeing Dr Nasser for almost 8 years and love that she is patient, friendly and knowledgeable. She tries holistic approaches to help avoid medications as able, which is much appreciated when pharmaceuticals are prescribed instead of trying to fix the root problem and improve health overall.  I wouldn't trust my families Healthcare needs with anyone else!< /Text>< Time>

Dr. Nasser and staff are absolutely the best you will ever get... I drive approximately 50 miles each way to see Dr. Nasser as she is that good... she has a GREAT bedside manner and is extremely helpful to me and my needs.
The office manager, Robin Henry, is very easy to talk to and is also very helpful...
I HIGHLY recommend Family First

When you leave a message they get back to you within a day or two. Very efficient with referrals and prescription renewals. I love the staff and have seen many of the nurses and doctors. Since they are all good I honestly do not mind who I see when I go in as I have never had a bad experience. I would definitely recommend them.<//Text>< Response>

As a new patient to Family First I was referred to Dr. Nasser by at least 5 different people. I found Dr. Nasser to be everything and more of what I was looking for in a doctor. As most doctors, she's very busy but she took the time to assess my mental state as well as my physical state. She listened to me and followed through with my health concerns with tests bringing my medical records up to date.
The staff at the front desk is always very helpful and pleasant too. I noticed that they answer each other's phones, so no phone is left ringing and ringing. If someone is away from their desk, someone will leave their desk to attend to my needs so I'm not left waiting.
It's not an overstatement to say, "I love my doctor". Dr. Nasser is very educated and compassionate and I'll bet her love of the Lord has something to do with that. I feel so blessed to have found her.
Family First truly means, "Family First".
Thank you, Janet Ross.😏</text>

Family First family medical has been wonderful for our whole family. Dr Nasser and her staff are kind, considered and have a well run office.  They are always willing to answer our questions and explain things so that we can understand. My husband, myself and our Down syndrome son have all experienced good care. Thank you Dr Nasser and your experienced staff.

<review>The person who is in charge of filling prescriptions in this office is totally incompetent. I can’t count the number of times I have tried to get a new or monthly prescription filled and this person has failed to get it done. If you see a doctor and they send it in while you’re there, it is fine, but if you have to call them for it, forget about it. You are NOT getting your prescription. Totally frustrating!!<//review>< pics>

Everything was great starting from getting my appointment as a new patient, to being seen and feeling like they care and want to help you. The staff is all very friendly. I'm happy with my provider they made me an appointment with NP Karina Razo, she's very nice and she listens, answers all questions and concerns. Wish I would have came here sooner. The wait time is like so fast its great, the office runs so smooth and they are all professional. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a new doctor.</Review>

Going to the doctor is not something people look forward to for the most part however Dr. Susan Nasser and her staff are successfully changing that with such an upbeat and exciting vibe I must say I look forward to my next office visit.

In addition to leaving me with a want to go back to find out more, she actually left me feeling she not only sincerely cares about her patients but is a extremely knowledgeable doctor. Thorough, skilled and dedicated with a very important trait.... a wonderful bedside manner.

No, she didn't pay me for my review, she didn't have to. If you are looking for what you have been missing all your life, give her a try!<//text>

<Review>I want to be honest and explain that while I work here, I see the providers staying late, trying to fit patients, providing a higher level of service and a staff trying to be the best family practice in Lancaster.

They are trying to do anything they can and that is why I feel they are an amazing family practice.

Our family enjoys the entire group of providers and that should say a lot.  I trust them with me and my family and every family should visit them.  You will find yourself enjoying the atmosphere of the office and the providers.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Another wonderful visit with Dr Nasser at Family First Family Medical Practice. The staff is great and always asks how my family and son are. Office is clean and has beanbags, books, table and chairs for children. There are toys in every room to help keep children entertained.

Dr. Nasser really cares about my whole health. She understands how my families health effects mine ans is willing to listen. Today she should have charged me for a therapy session, she listened and helped me turn my outlook around.

I am so thankful for the care we receive at Family First and highly recommend them.<//text>

The best care and reassurance from a dr I have ever gotten. All the staff is great and efficient in everything. Especially in the covid time of uncertainty. They made me feel at home and the atmosphere is calm. Didn't wait long and everything goes very smoothly there. I am so glad I found this dr's office and would recommend it to everyone.<//Text>

<text>Dr. Susan Nasser DO, Michi FNP, and Karina FNP are three of the most absolute best medical Providers for Family Practice in the entire Antelope Valley.  This clinic has such amazing providers who honestly care for their patients.  Here I feel like it's always about me instead of the money.  I mean this, this practice is on level with one of the strongest Family Medicine or Primary Care group I have been.  What strong group of key individuals... Do not go to anywhere else!!!!!!< /text><Name>Aaron H</Name>< pics>

This medical facility is the worst on the planet. The Office staff is clueless and after being with this office for well over 6 months, I never saw the Doctor, Yet I was seen by two worthless Nurse practitioners that were worthless and had no idea what to do. Never asked me a single question about my health or complaints. Each time I walked into the office it was like a ghost town and now I know why. They have done no lab work or other tests on me and I am on Dialysis have prostate cancer and other problems. Do not go to this office if you want to survive.</review>

Very quiet and pleasant shopping experience around 10 am store was neatly organized, didn't get greeted as you enter like other Dollar Tree Stores but thats not the problem... Cashier felt the need to put a METRO PCS Flyer IN EACH ONE OF MY BAGS which I DIDN'T want... It would be nice to ask a customer if I'd like one not just place it in my bagS THAT I AM ALREADY PURCHASING.. Don't assume I need the flyer,  please Keep You're Trash.
if I was interested in Metro service I would go there myself.<//review>

A small shop with glass cases full of figures/dolls, I picked up a DJ Qbert Dunny here for $20.  But a lot of the figures here are way more expensive, which makes it a nice place to just browse.  I also found the staff here to be very friendly and helpful.<//Text>

After my shopping I spoke with assistant manager Kristy and I explained my feelings as a customer about ALL carts being locked and how it's an inconvenience for the customer.
She tells me the have it together but the carts in question are from previous owners well, I tell her that this store doesn't have it together because if so customers wouldn't be inconvenienced her response was,You don't have to shop here."

<text>This place was really just OK. In my opinion, I really did not think it deserves the rating it currently holds. For the location and demographics, it is better than most of other ramen places in the area. Based on the soup broth and the basic flavors of the ingredients (egg, bamboo shoots) It's is not very authentic. Friendly tip, don't stray from the main selling ramen items.

*The picture is their kids meal. Not recommended.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrXnyAI1Tc-Scjk8n5QTk3I_eQHth3qVzm6Mdv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

<review>Great ramen spot with all of your favorite modern varieties (black garlic oil tonkotsu and spicy miso) along with a great variety of appetizers and yakitori.  We enjoyed the ramen and the chashu was particularly delicious, tender and flavorful.  The kids gobbled up the gyoza and takoyaki.  I had the beef tongue yakitori and they were excellently prepared.  Service here was good and the ambiance in the restaurant is fresh and modern.  Enjoyed our experience here and we will definitely be back.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvFIo17B1M2kYz2XhXGDN7WPb3-wxOqHL5MgIU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2NiF93uNE4BajTIYd_EO90Z91ftebbcEHHXH1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0aeoPBRaCQDBbnP4qD_Q5SHPEiZnxqBBfgIFx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWGgmpYLNMM73eVRGpzCRrd66NCgprhh2Hgn3f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiNwERCzWF9jy322tLDq8Jjr948ghJMSFC-wux=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgWP_XYfvq37To4HqGFetHWrZROszSQ5hpr4oX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgpCTlpdCnwMhSFlicIESE1h75B9iHKd1poAW_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

<Text>A great new addition to the area, J San Izakaya is a fantastic, comfortable, delicious ramen spot. Ordered the black tonkotsu ramen, which had a very rich broth, perfect amount of garlic flavor, and well prepared chashu. The service was very attentive, with food arriving promptly. The waitress easily answered all our questions about the food, and made good recommendations. Parking is easy, and price is fair (9-10$ with everything included). Atmosphere is not too loud, casual and comfortable, and clean. Will definitely be back again!<//Text></record>

I noticed some people gave this place one star some people gave his place to Stars well I guess I understand everybody has their own taste and their own likes and dislikes so I'm going to just give you mine. I for one eat at many many ramen restaurants and I do mean many LOL now my experience it was nothing but glorious if you will. I was greeted kindly upon entering the police have plenty of seating and the kitchen was in Clearview. The place was extremely clean for those of you that like clean eating establishments. And the staff was very attentive and kind. Now for the most important part in my opinion is the food and let me tell you I had the chicken ramen and it was absolutely delicious I would only have one minor complaint and that's that the broth wasn't hot enough in my opinion but that's very minor considering the taste of the broth and the well doneness of the noodles they were al dente with great flavor and texture. Now the most important thing would I come here again absolutely and I plan on bringing my family and friends the next time I visit this fine establishment. So if I were you I would definitely give this place a try I honestly don't think you would get disappointed but then again some people have been here and have only rated it one star but in my opinion even they should give this place a second try. Hope you give them a chance and let me know what you think.< /review>

I had curry and wow, I can’t wait to eat it again. It came with a pork cutlet, fried shrimp, rice, and of course the curry. The curry had ground pork in it, if I remember correctly, making it so much more delicious than other curries I’ve had.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>This is our new go to spot for ramen. The spicy miso tonkatsu is very flavorful. The restaurant seems to be gaining some popularity because there would be an occasional wait. You will often see a crowd of people waiting outside for their name to be called. Sometime when you phone in a order, they will not answer due to the volume of orders they may be taking in.<//Text>< Response>

Large japanese place with pretty decent Japanese food. Mostly hot dish items, no sushi rolls here. 4 stars because they are not super generous with their ramen toppings but they could be aiming more for quality and not quantity.<//Review>

We arrived that at 7:15 pm. Left at 8:03 with no food but rude servise.
Very sad that after waiting for almost 30 mins for our food, I tried to reason with the worker, he just rudely told me: you either wait or go. I am very upset because I was there with my two yong kids, it's a busy night, so we waited to be seated and waited for long periods of time to get water. But the problem is the table came later than us already got their food, our order not even started yet. When I asked he said my order is the last order, I said that's not possible, we have been here for more than 20 mins. Something was wrong with the order.
But the worse thing is this guys asked a mother with two yong kids to go without any food after we waited for more than 30 mins. It's just unacceptable.</review>

Nothing special about this place. Ambiemce is above normal, place is fairly new. I ordered soft bone and chicken liver on the stick, missing the green onions on the chicken. I also had tonkatsu ramen, pork was not good at all, egg yolk is almost well done. Overall if you're not particular on ramen, I say this place is ok. Price is good.<//review>

Great experience here. I came about a week ago to purchase some canaries and the owner was beyond helpful. I came back the following to purchase some more and the experience was even better the second time. I have already referred a lot of my coworkers and friends to his shop and I HIGHLY recommend you stop by. Fair prices and great quality birds.<//Review>

My experience with this shop was the best ever! The owner Gilmar is very experienced with parrots and birds! He really takes the time to explain care for your feathered friends. His prices are reasonable. I searched all of Los Angeles for an Indian Ringneck with no luck until I came across this shop! He has a variety of them to choose from but they go fast! He also has many other species of parrots.</review>

There were customers in the shop so they asked us to wait outside  - which was reasonable. We waited for 20 minutes and no one came out to ask what we were looking for or give us an update on wait time. There were at least 3 shopkeepers inside so it wasn't like there was no one who could come out to us. They may not have had what we're looking for. Or maybe they did. In either case, not going back.</text>

Little dinky tiny dirty bird shop I ever bumped into. Stayed in there for less than one minute and came out. They did not have much selections for exotic birds at all, other than quails, chickens and doves. The did have canaries and budgies. Not much selections for bird feeds either. And it's in middle of no where. Would not recommend< /review>

We had a great experience with the owners (Gilmar & Patricia) at this place! We bought a Double Yellow Headed Amazon Parrot, and we do not regret it! We came in looking for a baby parrot, and he introduced us to this parrot which we fell in love immediately. Gilmar suggested to not take him home until he felt that the bird will be ready in a healthy and survival rate. He took great care of our parrot and able to take him home a couple weeks later. Gilmar gave us instructions how to take care of the parrot, and any questions to reach out. With due sincerity, if you are looking for a bird pet, this is the place to get it! Owners are very friendly, honest and knowledgeable. Thank you Gilmar for the awesome experience! We are truly happy with our parrot!</Review>

I was in search of conure. Found this place because the initial store I was going to was closed.
Once I arrived they were only allowing 1 party at a time inside. It’s a small but very organized place with different birds . They had different baby birds in stock . Gilmar was super helpful and knew exactly how to match me with the perfect companion. So far I have 1 day with her and she is active , eating , sleeping - she is only 4 months old and I went with the pineapple conure. He even set up the cage for me and explained that I can come back for grooming and nail trims. He made me feel comfortable and was super helpful. I highly recommend if you are looking for baby birds he is your guy ! Thank you GILMAR and family for being super kind ! 🦜< /review>

Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! My poor mom is heartbroken. I got her a baby cockatiel for her birthday and the day after we got this bird we took her to the vet and the bird got admitted into the hospital over night and had IV fluids and oxygen. The vet stated she was lethargic and not doing well and must of been sick from this bird shop since we only had her for not even a day. This sweet little bird went into cardiac arrest and they performed CPR on her and sadly passed away. After spending $300 in his store and $640 at the vet and to be left devastated. DO NOT COME HERE!< /text>

I absolutely loooove this bird store. A warm and inviting family owned business. Gil is a very knowledgeable keeper and breeder. All of the birds were very healthy and clean. I will definitely be returning to purchase from this store.

I spent some time getting to know the owner and learning the history of this shop. I cant wait to go back. I got to handle some cockatiels, amazons and love birds and they were all very tame and appeared healthy.

There's even a chatty macaw named mango there presently perched out freely just relaxing. I have only positive things to say about this shop. Great place for to get a quality reasonably priced bird.<//Text>

I can’t begin to explain how happy my husband and I are with our visit AND purchase of two beautiful baby English Burgies. Gilmar took the time to walk us through the different types of birds. We had a lot of questions because we just lost a parrot (purchased elsewhere). He took the time to answer our questions and any concerns we had. All this to say, WE are so happy and can’t wait to surprise our son with these two beautiful birds. Thank you Gilmar!< /review>

<Review>My husband had been wanting a bird for quite some time so I did a google search & found this great family pet shop. When I called Mr. Gil (the owner) was so knowledgeable & so nice that I decided to take the drive out there to check it out. We purchased a baby Indian Ringneck on Father’s Day as a gift for my hubby. We fell in love with our turquoise baby parrot “Ringo”. He is such a lovely, smart birdie who loves music. He brought so much joy to our home that we decided to get him a friend. Just over the weekend we brought “Summer” home (she’s also a baby Indian ringneck). She’s so shy but she’s so lovable. For anyone that is looking for a pet I highly recommend this place. It’s a small little shop with many baby birds (which are hard to find ) & the prices are great. Mr. Gil will work with you to make sure you go home with a beautiful pet at a reasonable price.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<review>Me and my husband were very happy with his information about birds. I’ve bought birds in other places and I’ve had trouble taming them. I love that he takes very good care of the birds. The person who gave a low review and saying that the birds don’t get fed or are too cramp up. They have enough space to be around. I’ve seen him hand feed the baby birds. I’m sure his not always going to be feeding them in front on the customers. I’m very satisfied with my bird.my conure  Is very healthy and tamed. He is very caring  and takes time with each and one of those birds. This is one place I would highly recommend. He also taught me how to tamed my other ring birds..and I did exactly what he told me and they are slowly coming around. Great customer service for sure.<//review><Rate>5</Rate>< Time>

After seeing all these good reviews, I visited this shop and really regret doing business here. I purchased a baby Conure from Quetzal in order to save her from the terrible conditions at this shop. The cages were crowded and dirty.  Birds looked unhealthy.  Upon taking her to the vet to get testing it was revealed that she had avian papilloma virus.  This is highly contagious to other birds.  If you purchased a bird from here recently please go get it checked.  Newcomers find another shop that tests for these things.<//Review>

We found this place on Yelp and based our decision to come to them for service based on the number of positive reviews. Maybe... they are a good place when purchasing a bird. But they are house of torture for bird grooming. AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS! Never bring your Bird to them for grooming.

Seemingly, Gilmar (owner) does NOT know how to professionally groom a bird. Our bird lost one of its nails in a towel that he used to wrap it in while he had our bird under his care. He later claimed that the bird came in without one nail - which clearly was not true because he went back in to check the towel and found the nail. He claimed that our bird was calcium-deficient and that's why it lost the nail. That we should feed it Calcium. That the nail "should" grow back eventually.

The bird was in a state of shock and distressed because it was hurt. Our Vet confirmed that the nail was lost due to Trauma (as in not falling off on its own) and also stated that the wings were cut terribly. Our bird's physical did not show a calcium deficiency. Our bird is now on meds and recovering. Gilmar, shouldn’t claim to be able to groom birds if he can’t do it properly.

When I spoke to him on the phone, He kept repeating that he's been in business for 12 years and that if he didnt know what he was doing that how could he still be in business. At this point, I had not accused him of anything but he insisted on defending himself. (A sign of a guilty mind).Well, we'll see what the state license board has to say about that.

Update: Gilmar calls my number during my work hours when I could not answer and proceeds to leave a voicemail message stating that nothing in my review is true and that they don’t torture animals and that I hide behind this review instead of calling him directly. Ha! Silly me! I thought he was going to apologize or at least express concern for my bird. Nope, not this guy. He claimed that my one review would not affect him because he has many other reviews. Not trying to hurt him at all, just trying to keep anyone else’s bird from being hurt by him.

< review>
I called this small pet shop last week, looking for a young cockatiel for my kids. Over the phone, Gilmar the owner, was very nice and told me he had only one baby cockatiel in his shop. I was hesitant about getting a baby bird, but he assured me he would show me how to feed and take care of my bird. Once in the shop, he had many beautiful young and healthy looking birds. He showed me the cockatiel, and after I agreed to take her, he showed me right then and there how to feed her. He spent the time to show me how to mix her food, how to feed her and talk me through the process. He cares about his birds and asked me to try to feed her right then and there so that we would be confident I was going to do it correctly. He gave me discounts on everything also. One week later, after following Gilmar’s instructions, my bird is growing, is healthy and happy and we are so happy to have her. truly a great experience, great service and even better bird advice!< /review>

2 weeks ago I was doing a search for a pet bird for my 7yr old son. I came in on a Saturday after work to his pet shop I met the Owner and told him I was interested in a African Grey he didn't have one on sale at that moment but told me he would help me get one. He had a Green cheek canure for sale. I went home and called him that afternoon asking him for the canure that I might be interested on buying it. So Sunday I showed up with my Son Rafita and ask him if he wanted it. So we brought her home. The owner was really good on giving me information on Jamie which that the name my son gave her. Ever since that day Jamie is starting to adapt to her new home and my Son is really happy to have her. So I really recommend this small shop that is well sorted out with lots of goodys for your birds. Iam looking forward on keep on doing business with this man and supporting his business for many future years to come.</Text>

The birds were crammed in small cages. The sun Conures and jendays had barely any water to drink/splash around in, and they were in the sunlight. They had no food either, and they looked sick. Their noses were stuffed and one of the birds seemed seriously ill, he was puffed up and it looked like they gave him no attention at all, as his bottom beak was Un-trimmed and the top beak was slanted because of that. They had no bird toys, or anything to chew on, so they started chewing on the cage.
Not to mention, inside, the cockatiels were eating straight seeds, no fruits or veggies or pellets.
There were five or six other cockatiels in one tank, probably a foot long.
In short, I feel these people don’t know much about birds. I pray somebody helps the birds out cause I feel sick after seeing parrots in those conditions. It’s illegal to keep parrots in cages that don’t fit the requirements.
My heart aches for the birdies there. I hope they end up at a nice home.</Text>

<Review>My current water heater starting leaking last Saturday late afternoon. It was 24 days out of warranty. I started making calls as to replacing it but to no avail. I did receive verbal price quotes but it looked like Monday would be the first time I could get a replacement, maybe. My last call was to Bill Metzger Plumbing. Bill is a long time local plumber with a great reputation. Bill said he would have one of his men out first thing Monday to look at the situation. Jacob showed up at 10:00. I told Jacob I wanted to change water heaters brands and put in a Bardsford & White 75 Gal. Jacob gave me a great price and asked if I wanted to do it now. After taking cold showers I was looking for a warm shower. Jacob called the supplier, they had one and it would be delivered. After about 3 hours Jacob was done with the removal and installation of the new water heater. All and All a great job, great price and great service.
I highly recommend Bill Metzger and Jacob.</Review>< resp>

We charge per specific job task & not by the hour in order to ensure fairness & quality of work. With our 50 + years of experience it normally takes 2 or more hours to complete the specific job tasks performed. We had two technicians on-site. Tech (2) was advised by your wife while tech (1) was working in the kitchen that the upstairs bathroom hot & cold line was crossed incorrectly. Upon inspection, Tech (2) discovered the nuts & drain connection needed to be adjusted. We uncrossed the lines, tightened the nut connections & the drainage with no additional charge. Tech (2) then cleaned up while tech (1) was working on the billed item & collected payment. I would appreciate if you could please call me at 949-485-0195  to further discuss. Again, I want to apologize for any lack of customer service & hope to hear from you shortly as we want to keep your business for life.\nSincerely, Arik Metzger'}< /Response>

<Review>Over priced. Did not bid or customize our request. Charged a ridiculous amount for being at our house 1 hr. Would not recommend or use them again.

UPDATE: The owner called and personally apologized for any confusion on this job. He gave me a discount and made it right. I had them come back and install my sink faucet. They did a great job and have certainly earned my business back with their incredible customer service. It’s truly a family owned business that cares.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Technician’s attention to detail was impressive, as well as his knowledge of the trade. My husband was a plumber for 50 years and he said he learned things from the technician. He was very personable and cleaned up after himself.  I also really appreciated being apprised of his schedule and when he was running a little bit late. I would recommend this company to everyone.<//text>

Bill Metzger Plumbing is the best! I’ve used this company several times before and highly recommend them. It was easy to make an appointment, my repairman was very skilled and arrived on time.
Zach did a couple of jobs for me and the jobs were done professionally, safely and quickly. Not only is Zach a skilled plumber, he’s a really nice guy too. I was treated with courtesy, respect and friendliness.
I will not hesitate to use this company again. Very pleased!</Review>

Super responsive. Great communication. Bill Metzger provided excellent advice- responded almost instantly. Followed up to see how we were doing and assured us someone would be here to resolve our problem and restore water to the house. Victor came out on Saturday evening. Assessed the situation. Performed a temporary repair to restore our house water until we could secure the necessary parts on Monday. Look forward to working with them to complete the repairs when we secure the parts. I would definitely recommend them to family and friends.<//review>

Bill and his crew are trustworthy people of character and solid work ethic. I’ve been calling Bill for the almost 30 years here. When we need help In their field of expertise, I never think of calling anyone else. When I call I, he sees who it is but I start by saying, “Hi, Bill. It’s your favorite customer, Terry! Then we visit and update each other what’s been going on in our lives. Thanks, Bill. Your thankful friend, Trafalgar-Terry.</Text>

The whole process, went very smoothly, I spoke with Jen, she texted me a window of time, when to expect the plumbers. She updated us, when they were running behind and then when they were on their way and a photo/name of who to expect. Victor and his helper worked very efficiently and knew what they were doing. Overall we were very pleased and will definitely call Metzgers again and also refer them to friends and family.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1616704434186, 'text': 'Bonnie,\nPlease thank Diane for all she has done to refer work next time you see her!!

The woman who answered was nice, professional and let me know they would have someone out within a couple hours. I loved that I received a txt confirmation with my scheduling details and then another txt letting me know who my plumber was going to be and a picture so I know who I’m answering my door for. It made me feel very safe as my husband was at work and I don’t like answering if I’m home alone. Victor arrived earlier then expected which was great because we had an issue with a leak and had to turn water off. He did a really great job, quick, no mess, very professional, and nice to my dog. I will definitely call them first next time!< /Review>< Pics>

<text>Great experience, great work, and great people.  We broke a valve under the sink when trying to shut off the water.  Based on their high ratings, I decided to call Bill Metzger Plumbing.

It was late in the afternoon, Bill had a tech out first thing the next morning.  Jacob arrived about 10 minutes early.  He went through the work he was going to perform and the cost.

He was extremely professional, knowledgeable, detailed, and friendly.  The work was completed with very high quality!  Thank you to the entire team for being so responsive and for caring so much about your customers.<//text><Name>Peter Frankukdakis< /Name>< response>

Repairman was prompt (actually, early) which is important wrt plumbing problems.
He had all the necessary tools and 'scoped-out' (planned) the job, before he started.
He told me what he was going to do and how much it would cost.
I think the drain clean-out was more difficult than expected. He checked the alignment of the snake tool and persevered.
A bit of water splashed so he carefully draped the kitchen cabinets  before going on.
He cleaned up well after the work was successfully completed.
Very professional and responsible workmanship.
I'll call Metzker, again.</review>

I've dealt with 7-8 service companies in the past year, due to a home move. Plumbers, HVAC, fire sprinkler, drywall, electricians - you name it.

Bill Metzger provided the best overall experience of them all. From answering the phone with a professional approach, using helpful technology such as SMS for confirmations & updates, sending out a competent & friendly service tech to the quality work, I cannot imagine a better option for your plumbing needs.

Full disclosure, I cannot speak to the value, as I did not get other estimates. But, IMO, when it comes to plumbing (and electric), the quality of work and peace of mind is much more important than saving a few bucks. And for all I know, they were the most competitive price too.

Highly recommend!< /text><userid>114186666296131183328<//userid><name>M Enachi< /name>< pics>

<Review>Bill Metzger replaced our water heater a few years ago and when we had a slab leak, they are the ones we called.  The company sent us Luis to check out our leak.  Luis did a really great job fixing the problem.  He kept us informed as to the progress finding the leak problem and then the solutions.  Very happy with the work Luis did for us.  You could tell he really knows his trade and was very efficient in completing the job.</Review>< pictures>

<review>I purchased a new water heater years ago from Bill Metzger.  It was the first time that I have had to replace a water heater in my home.  He was very clear about what type of water heater I needed in my home based off of what we previously had & what would work for us.  He completed the job as indicated.

More recently during the start of Covid, I had an issue with a leak in one of the copper pipes.  I called Bill on a Sunday morning, and he answered the phone.  He provided me with excellent customer service, and had his technician out to my house within an hours time.  His technician was knowledgeable, kind, and professional.  He completed the repair and he was on his way.  For people that are nervous about having people in their homes during this time, the technician took all precautions for safety.  He came in through the garage and wore gloves and a mask.  I would recommend this company to anyone.  Thank you Bill Metzger!<//review>< pictures>

Very responsive office staff (Shelley). Sent a plumber to my house next day for leaky shower valve which I thought and was told by a previous plumber that I had at my house said would be unfixable and I would need a whole new shower install. I call Bill Metzger Plumbing and explained my situation and the next day a plumber arrived...gave previous notification via text and e-mail of arrival, was professional, clean, respectful and mostly, understanding. Gregory assessed the situation, explained how he would fix, then gave me a very reasonable quote. I accepted and he proceeded to start the job. He showed me the problem with the valves, fixed them properly and completed the job within 45 minutes! I could not have been happier!! I will definitely use Bill Metzger Plumbing in the future for all my plumbing needs!! Thank you Greg, you were professional, respectful, kind and most of all friendly!!👍🏼< /review>

<text>Zach was very approchable and professional. Not only was he able to take care of a leak from our water relief line, he did a thourough inspection of the property and we discussed other future plumbing tasks. It's a great feeling to work with a company that has great reviews and actually delivers when you try them.< /text>< Name>

Carlos came to our house to fix our pilot light and showed us step-by-step where the problem was it was very obvious he was very thorough.

He came on the same day we called which was wonderful squeezed us in at the end of the day then head to get a part first thing in the morning and actually came earlier knowing that we needed to leave as soon as possible.
He was very efficient in his repair and we were still able to get our early start.

My husband said be sure that we get BILL Metzger plumbing and get Carlos to do the work next time we need someone!!!

<rating>5</rating><Text>Bill Metzger Plumbing sent Luis out to fix our slab leak. I would give 6 stars out of 5 if that was an option. Luis knew exactly where the problem was and how to fix it. He ended up replacing two water lines for no extra charge instead of only the one that was quoted. He also installed two hose bibs for us.

Luis is an expert in his work, and communicates exactly what needs to be done before he starts. The quote was accurate and fairly priced.

Another benefit of Bill Metzger Plumbing is they keep a record of the previous work they have done on the house. After a quick phone call I was informed of work they had completed back in ‘12 which was nice to know. I highly recommend Bill Metzger plumbing.</Text>< user_name>

Zach came out to fix my clogged toilet.  Upon arriving he immediately made it clear that he was tired from his road trip he just got back from. And then when I offered to help with anyting, he said just sit back and listen to me complain. I also heard him say under his breathe how much he hates this job. Which I understand, its plumbing, but pretty unprofessional to have that kind of attitude with a customer.

I ignored it all and was still friendly, and then upon being charged over $550, I asked why so much and he said its more expensive because of the stair cases... but problem is the bathroom that he worked on was on the ground level.  So he didnt have to bring any equipment up any staircases other than the front step going into the front door.  So im not sure if this was price gauging or what, but I dont think I will be bringing my business back after this experience.  At least the toilet is working now...

Bill reached out after a poor experience and was super courteous and offered a refund for some of the unnecessary costs. Customer service was great and I’d recommend Bill</Review>

<Time>1585773116389< /Time><Rating>5< /Rating><review>My water heater went out and Bill set an appointment for the same day.  Jacob was on time and quick diagnosed the problem.  I opted to replace the water heater, and Jacob replaced it on the spot.  Everything went smoothly and all was well again in short order.  Jacob was courteous, friendly, competent and professional.  I have also worked with some of Bill’s other plumbers when I has my whole house repiped last year.  Having this done to your house is a very disruptive and unpleasant thing to go through.  Bills guys worked very hard, not only to get the job done right, but worked to make us as comfortable as possible.  There were only 2 nights we needed to stay in a hotel overnight.  Great job with no problems since.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>We had a very bad leak from the upstairs master bedroom en suite bath.  My husband called Bill Metzger plumbing and made an appointment for the next morning.  Luis came to our home, opened the wall and located the leak.  He replaced the cracked pipe and we are now drying out the wall area.  Prompt and professional!</Review>< user>

Thank you to Bill Metzger plumbing. I’m sure our job was more challenging than they anticipated but they kept to their estimate. They handled a tough job where we had a leak under our bathtub and some standing water with limited access. Needless to say I’m sure the job was not pleasant nor easy, but my wife said the plumber that came was more than a pro about the job. Not sure the name of the plumber that came out but that guy deserves a raise I’m sure. Thanks again. It’s the first time we used them, and definitely would not hesitate to use Bill Metzger plumbing again. Glad to see there are still local small town pros out there still such as these guys. They completed the job yesterday, in one day. The price was more than reasonable with no upfront fees such as I was told when I contacted some “other guys”. I feel like I should be thanking them. It’s an incredible service that you guys provided to us.  Thanks for saving our San Clemente home for us! We appreciate it.< /review>

<text>A local plumber that is reliable and  that I have been using for years.  My water heater broke! Bill Metzger Plumbing was able to send out a plumber the same day.  He replaced the water heater and left the area cleaner than before.  A sticker was left on the unit for future needs.  I suggest you give them a try and you won't be disappointed.< /text>< Pictures>

Everything was first rate.  A very friendly and reassuring scheduler who let me know everything was going to be fine. She made my day!  Felt like I had called the company of the guy that invented plumbing.
Great use of mobile technology so I knew who was coming, zero surprises. The plumber, Luis, was on time, very professional, and really gave me confidence that my water would be back on soon.  It was.  He also stayed and monitored his repair job to make sure it was done right.  I’m certain he could have simply filled the hole and left once I had paid and I wouldn’t have known the difference; but he double checked and made certain and that’s the point... commitment to doing a job thoroughly and professionally is so rare these days.
I’m so pleased to support local family tradesmen where pride of ownership oozes out of every customer touchpoint.  Bill Metzger is officially the first and likely only plumber I will ever call.  Ha! I was so impressed that I put their number in my cell phone so I never have to search again!!<//review>

Our water heater went out on Labor Day. Bill Metzger Plumbing not only answered the phone on a holiday, but provided a quote & scheduled us right away. Jacob was the service man who installed the new heater. He sent a text & called me to let me know when he was on his way. Professional, courteous & no surprise add on fees. Jacob did a GREAT job & I would highly recommend both Jacob & Bill Metzger Plumbing! Thank you for a great job!<//review>

Bill Metzger Plumbing of Tustin replaced a brand new tankless water heater for us. He did an outstanding job! He was recommended by Best Plumbers. I have found it to be absolutely true, this guy really is the Best Plumber in Tustin. These guys were really clean, professional and fast. I was not without hot water in my home for more than 3 hours. Again, great job Bill Metzger Plumbing of Tustin. I highly recommend you guys.<//review>

I called Bill Metzger Plumbing on a Friday morning to request an appointment about my very old water heater.  Tony came out that afternoon and carefully explained all my options.  I agreed to their estimate for a new water heater and set up an installation time for the following Monday.  Tony arrived and was professional and friendly from start to finish.  He was very good at explaining almost every step in the process and did an amazing job!  I would highly recommend Tony and Bill Metzger Plumbing and would not hesitate to use them again and will be recommending them to my friends!  Thank you for a painless process!<//review>

<text>I was impressed by Luis or Louie. You could tell that he had been here and done this before. His experience and professionalism was a nice commodity to have. Obviously, only time will tell about how great of work was done. But every indication we noticed was it was a smooth and successful repipe. It was all done orderly and very structured.    I would recommend Louie to anyone needing a repipe. Thanks for bringing the water back to our home Louie.<//text>< pictures>

My family has relied on Bill Metzger Plumbing exclusively for as long as I can remember. My dad went to high school with him and called Bill Metzger Plumbing the first time we needed a plumber. The plumber showed up on time and finished the job quickly, efficiently and cleanly. Since then we have never even considered calling another plumber.< /Review>

Found these guys on Best Plumbers. I called up and talked to the owner Bill and he was extremely helpful over the phone. He gave me an upfront ballpark price on what it was going cost over the phone. He was right on with the price because he knew exactly what I needed by hearing what I had to say over the phone. Extremely nice man! His technician was very polite and professional. Next time I need a plumber in Huntington Beach I'll be giving him a call. Thanks Bill Metzger Plumbing! You guys really are the Best!</Text>

I have 2 commercial buildings I look after in the same business park as Metzger Plumbing and they have always been fair, honest and timely with every repair. I usually call in the AM and the owner Bill answers my call. I do like that as I know he is involved and present in his business. I have had no less that 10 calls into them over the years and alway get the same service.
This is a good business and one I would recommend.<//Review>

I found Bill Metzger Plumbing on Best Plumbers. I called them to replace my old Rinnai tankless water heater with a brand new, state of the art Noritz tankless water heater. What a HUGE change this has made.

The guys at Bill Metzger Plumbing were absolutely outstanding. They were on time, clean, professional and know a lot about tankless water heaters. These guys really know their stuff.< /review>

<Text>Wow! Within seconds of submitting my request I received a call from Bill Metzger Plumbing offering assistance. That alone was amazing to experience, but then the representative said she could have a tech out within 30 mins. He actually showed up within even less than that! I really cannot believe they had someone available *at the ready* to come out and replace my busted hot water tank. Luis was super friendly, patient with all the first-timer questions, thorough in his explanations, super professional and really exceeded my expectations! Thank you Luis and Bill Metzger Plumbing! A++ job!<//Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Expert troubleshooting, quick leak detection, and superior service just when we needed it most.   It’s not every day that you see a professional go the extra mile and opt for a more difficult procedure for them in order to save a homeowner money and get the job done as quickly as possible.

Joe Arnold visited our home right on time. He asked me a few questions, took a look at the water damaged area, and said that the job would require a plumber to crawl under my house; Joe was by himself and is not a young man. He said that it would be better if he could call out another of their plumbers, because he would also need a second set of hands to assist with the job.  After trying to call for backup, he told me that it might take a day or two before he could tackle the job. I explained how not being able to use our sinks, toilets or showers for 24+ hours already had been a huge problem for our busy family of 4 (2 teens included).  Joe said that he was a father of three and that he totally understood. He offered to start immediately if I would be willing to be his second set of hands up top, while he crawled around underneath the house.  Joe let me know when to open the faucets, turn the water supply off and back on again, and walked me through shooting some compressed air down the damaged hot water pipe to dry it out so he could re-solder the damaged pipe.
Joe far exceeded my expectations and prevented a lot of extra mess, expense and delays by opting to take the more difficult route of crawling under the house instead of just cutting right into my living room wall.
I highly recommend Joe and Bill Metzger plumbing to anyone… They’re now my new go-to Plumber.</Review>

Luis was 1 hour early vs the time they said he would arrive which was good.
He used the parts I purchased to do the replacments (which I stated in advance I already had when I placed the call) and I did not see a reduction in the bill.
I was also disappointed that the bill stated the work he did was not covered under warranty.
Was it because he used my parts?
Plumbers work not done properly that could result in a leak after the repairs should be covered. Home repairs done by homeowners or handyman are not covered under insurance but licensed contractors should warranty their work.<//Review>

Bill Metzer Plumbing is the best, Called them on Friday night at 11:15  and Bill answered the phone and had Louis at my house at 12:15 the next day. Louis did a great job at re-routing a slab leak and got me going again. I have used them many times from water heater replacement to water leaks to replacement of faucets. Always a great job. Thanks Bill  and Louis.< /Text>

Tony and Eric replaced our very large (75 gallon) water heater this week. It was challenging to get this big tank in and out of a tight area, but they did it with confidence and were considerate to the surroundings. When I need a plumber again I will not have to look any further than this company.< /review>

We called and requested a plumber to fix a stopped-up Kitchen sink.  They were able to get someone to our home same day.  The plumber was very professional, gave us some great solutions for the future - what to use and what not to use and fixed our problem!  They are able to take care of everything on site, using latest technology and I would highly recommend contacting Bill Metzger Plumbing to everyone!

A very prompt (weekend) response. Luis was very professional and explained the situation very clearly. And then to install a replacement heater right away was great. Highly recommended.<//text>

Bill Metzger was very kind and helpful when I called asking for help after hours on a Saturday night.  He made sure someone would be at my home early the very next morning.  Greg Werner arrived right on time, was polite, very knowledgeable and had the issue resolved within the hour.</Review>

< review>
I found them on Best Plumbers, and have found it to be absolutely true. These guys are really good!

A guy named Greg showed up on time showed me what my problem was and fixed it. The thing about this Bill Metzger Plumbing I like the most was their honesty. They didn't promise me some ridiculous "drain cleaning special" just to get in front of me and then tell me I needed my entire sewer line replaced.

Greg was upfront and honest. He assessed the situation and gave me options. Bottom line, he got my floor drain flowing again in about an hour. However, he did inform me that I would most likely have the exact same problem again because I do actually have a cracked line. He didn't promise me he could clear it, but said he would try his best, and he did not try to high pressure me into replacing my entire sewer line that very day like the "drain cleaning special" company did before I called Bill Metzger Plumbing.

Thanks Bill Metzger Plumbing! You guys truly are the Best Plumber in San Clemente!< /review>

Tried to support a local "5 Star" plumbing company near me. Gave them a call, they told me $39.99 for a house visit. Plumber came over quickly and very professional however, the plumber told me it will cost an additional $150 just to try and light the pilot with no guarantee of fixing the issue. I gambled and said "let's do it." Of course it didnt light, I tried before calling but was expecting some professional troubleshooting. Nope. Then the plumber tells me to order the parts myself, the plumber doesn't even tell me what parts I need, I have to pry an educated guess out of him. Then he tells me once I get the parts to call them and they will install them for $250. I ask, "$250 on top of the $39.99 and $150 failed attempt?" And he says, "correct." So I'm thinking, how can repairing a 5 year old water heater cost $439.99??? That's the cost of an entire new water heater!!! The plumber was at least kind enough to waive the $39.99 and I paid the $150 but will not be calling this company back for anything ever again.< /review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>We had our double kitchen sinks stop up. Garbage disposal stopped working and water came up from drains in both sinks. Although our technician, Luis, arrived quite a bit later than the originally promised time slot, he came, got the job done, was very neat and careful about everything, and Mr. Metzger added a very generous discount because of the technician’s late arrival. Luis was very respectful of us and our home. He was careful to cover areas or move rugs, so as to keep things clean and protected. We have used Bill Metzger plumbing for a number of years and will continue to do so. We would strongly recommend him for any plumbing needs, as he always gets the job done and is extremely fair about pricing.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>Requested a bid and service on line for a faulty tankless water heater. Immediate response! Offer for service call! Service call on time! Of course when Dan arrived I had hot water. Such s life. He was so professional. Immediately said no need to spend money unnecessarily. When does any plumber tell you that???! Thank you so much Metzger for your honesty and integrity.

So now I have hot water and Dan instructs me exactly what to do the next time we lose it: take a picture of the problem code. Thank you Dan.

I had just been going out and turning it on and off then on again.

Now I have scheduled them to install a kitchen sink faucet and a ventless gas fireplace set for us!

Great Company! Great service!

I have live in San Clemente since 1971. So nice to have a local company to trust!< /Review><user_id>115278873314523708332</user_id><Gmap_id>0x80dcf382c3b53199:0x3f286fb772964593</Gmap_id>< pics>

I manage a portfolio of about 75 units ranging from high-end single-unit condos to a few multi-unit buildings all over the city. I stumbled upon Bill Metzger Plumbing
after a friend of mine recommended them after meeting Tom at a local networking event. I can 100% percent say that Tom and his team of amazing plumbers has made my job so much easier, and my days a bit less stressful. They are quick, efficient, reasonably priced, and beyond</review>

< Review>
Installation of a new hot water heater went well except for the fact that a couple of days later a gas leak was discovered which was not apparent before the installation and I had to call the gas company twice within two weeks to assess the situation and ultimately Metzger had to return to repair the unit. Therefore and unfortunately I consider the installation was not initially completed by Metzger. I have been a loyal customer for 25 years and this is the first instance in which I was disappointed in the service.<//Review>

Found these guys on Best Plumbers! A really friendly gentleman named Luis arrived and saved the day. This guy really knows water heaters inside and out. He showed me exactly what was wrong and what was causing the problem. Luis also gave me options. He showed me what he could do for a quick fix, but then also explained to me why I would have the same problem again down the road because of what was causing the element not to work properly.

I ended up having a brand new water heater installed. Luis worked really hard, and did the job fast.

Luis was clean, professional, polite, hard-working, I could go on and on and on... I can't say enough good things about this company Bill Metzger Plumbing & Luis.

Thanks Bill Metzger Plumbing of Huntington Beach! You really are the Best!</review>

Outstanding work, appearance and scheduling.  They are the best in so cal.

Bill Metzger's crew is always on time or early.  They get right to work and do an excellent job.  We have had plenty of services done by the crew from Bill Metzger's Shop.

There is nothing right about having to take a cold shower when the old water heater goes out.  A new one was installed the same day as requested and that to my wife, is quality service.

Thank you, Bill and crew...< /Text>

< Review>
We had a leak coming from the upstairs sink down into our family room at 5 pm.  To make matters worse we were leaving the next morning on a flight to see our daughter graduate from college.  Let’s just say we were in PANIC mode!! I went on Yelp and saw Metzger had good reviews.  They were at our house within the hour, did great work, and the cost was VERY reasonable.< /Review>

<Text>This company quickly responded to our request to fix a leak and did so professionally.  Several options were presented with no pressure to select the most expensive.  We opted to select a new kitchen faucet and the plumber had it on the truck and installed it in less than an hour.<//Text>< Pics>

<rate>5</rate><Review>I had multiple drains backing up at my house late in the day and I called Metzger Plumbing due to personal referrals and their positive Yelp reviews. Mona in the office originally could not have anyone come out until the next morning but soon called me back and said she was able to schedule someone to come out in the late afternoon. Monte the plumber showed up within an hour of Mona's callback to assess the situation. Monte then told me what needed to be done and gave me an upfront quote for the work. Monte made the repair professionally and efficiently for the same price he originally quoted. I would definitely use Monte for future work and also refer Monte and Metzger Plumbing to friends. Thanks Mona for following up to schedule a same day repair and Monte for a job well done</Review>< Pics>

Excellent service.  Art came out to my house to hook up a new gas line to my Jacuzzi heater.  He called me ahead of time to tell me he was on the way and got to my house right on time.  All my connections to the gas line were done the same day.  Art was very professional the entire time and explained the process to me in detail.  I definitely recommend this plumbing service.</text>

We have a leak and the gas company shut off the gas. We called The insurance company and Bill Metzger plumbing sent Taylor. He was so nice and polite, very knowledgeable, explained everything beforehand. He found another leak in the garage, called the company for an authorization and fix it. We highly recommend this company for all your plumbing needs. :<//text>

< review>
After discovering water on my garage floor, I called Bill Metzger Plumbing for help, the lady on the phone was great, she arranged for the plumber to be at my home within a half an hour.

He started draining the water immediately, unfortunately I received a call back from my landlord that he wants to send his own plumber to fix the problem.

When I told him that we can't use his service due to our landlord's decision, this gentleman was so wonderful, he continued to drain the water to help us out and left without charging anything.

I have never had service like this before.  Great experience.< /review>

Art Betts came on time. He was super professional. He carried booties with him and put them on automatically before entering the house. I always have to tell other people to wear booties, but Art was naturally cool! Art was such a total professional, he was like a doctor of plumbing. He said he would take good care of us, and he did. The job was perfect. He double and triple checked for leaks and pressure when he was done. The job was spotless. He was very pleasant. Worked hard. Honest. Gave a good price. I was happy to pay for his work. I would recommend Art Betts of Metzger Plumbing to anyone. Thanks so much Art!<//review>

<user_id>103815557660860129015< /user_id><Text>We were serviced by Monte Moore on 5/6/16 for a severly blocked master bath combo sink.  Had to cut through dry-wall after having a large mirror removed.  His was very professional and insightful and willing to do whatever was necessary and did so while sacrificing his own time to be with his family.  I can't thank him enough for giving us our master bath back.  He also checked our water pressure and water heater and gave us estimates on a water heater replacement given its age of 16 years.  Thanks Bill Metzger for having employees like Monte Moore to service your customers.</Text><Rating>5<//Rating>< Date>

<Review>I walked into my garage Christmas 2017 morning to find a steam of water flowing from  a broken water heating supply hose. The water damage wasn’t too bad, BUT we we are having 20 guests over later today and I needed help fast. Not only did Bill answer my emergency call personally, but he quickly connected me to one of his nearby plumbers who helped me fixed the problem fast and affordablly. Thank you guys. You will always be my first call. Merry Christmas from an especially thankful family of five.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Would never use again or recommend. Not up to code and they told me that I would have to pay extra afterwards to make it up to code. Plus they keep requesting me to post reviews.</text>

Called this company early in the evening, they say they are 24 hours a day, had a gentleman be rather short and say he will see if he has someone to come out ( I'm also in Tustin, less than a mile from the address they say they are located at)  It was an emergency call with plumbing backing up and flooding.  He stated he'd see if he could find someone and would call me back in a minute.  Never heard back.  A day and a half later still no call back and since it was an emergency I went elsewhere.  Horrible customer service.  Didn't value a customer in need.<//Text>

When they came to unclog the sink, they left me with a broken garbage disposal. After waiting a full day for them to come back and fix the garbage disposal (they never showed up), they again failed to show up on time three days later, but did note that they would be charging me the full amount to fix the broken disposal. I am usually patient, but I felt so much of my time had been wasted. I will find another plumber to finish the job.< /Text>
